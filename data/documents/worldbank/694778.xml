1. MONGOLIA'S URBAN SERVICES SECTOR&#13;
A. MONGOLIA: A COUNTRY IN ECONOMIC TRANSITION&#13;
1.1   Mongolia, landlocked between Russia and China, is a relatively poor country,&#13;
with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of only about $440 in 1996. Compared&#13;
with many other low-income countries, Mongolia's economy is relatively well&#13;
diversified, with agriculture-primarily livestock-accounting for about 20 percent of&#13;
GDP; industry-principally mining and wool, cashmere, leather and food processing-&#13;
for 45 percent of GDP; and the services sectors, including a large government sector, a&#13;
weak banking system and a growing private wholesale and retail trading sector,&#13;
accounting for the balance.&#13;
1.2   Mongolia is among the world's most sparsely-populated countries (1.46 per km2),&#13;
with an area of some 1.6 million km2-half the size of India-and a population of only&#13;
2.32 million people. About a quarter of the population are nomadic herders whose&#13;
livestock outnumber the human population 11 to 1. Land, although relatively abundant,&#13;
has limited productivity and a short growing season because of the country's harsh,&#13;
semiarid continental climate and relatively high altitude. Besides sizable reserves of&#13;
copper and other minerals, Mongolia has a potential for petroleum production in&#13;
commercial quantities. The population is well educated, with an adult literacy rate of 96&#13;
percent and a sizable skilled labor force. Until 1990 and the end of its 70 years as a&#13;
centrally planned economy, Mongolia benefited from substantial grant financial&#13;
assistance (estimated at 30 percent of GDP annually) and managerial assistance from the&#13;
former Soviet Union (FSU).&#13;
1.3   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the attendant sudden withdrawal of its aid,&#13;
and the collapse of demand from traditional Soviet-bloc trading partners who accounted&#13;
for 95 percent of its exports, Mongolia suffered a massive economic shock. Real GDP&#13;
fell by 20 percent during 1990-93, causing a sharp deterioration in both the external&#13;
payment position and the Government's fiscal position. The Government responded with&#13;
an austerity program characterized by gradual liberalization toward a market economy,&#13;
including price decontrol and privatization. In 1992-93, small enterprises and livestock&#13;
ownership were rapidly privatized, and by end-1994, the assets of about 1,200 large&#13;
public enterprises were privatized, although the remaining 200 public enterprises still to&#13;
be reformed account for over 30 percent of employment and value added in the economy.&#13;
1.4   At the same time, hyperinflation forced severe government cutbacks, causing&#13;
delivery of social services to plummet and with them, social conditions:  school&#13;
attendance dropped 30 percent, maternal mortality doubled, the real value of pensions fell&#13;
by 60 percent, wages nearly halved, and an estimated 30 percent of the population still&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
live below the poverty line. During this period, the Association assisted the Government&#13;
with foreign exchange support for critical imports, technical assistance in key&#13;
macroeconomic and sectoral areas and investments and technical assistance to begin&#13;
rehabilitating the transportation system. In 1996, a poverty assessment study (Report No.&#13;
15723-MOG) was backed up by projects to alleviate the effects of the economic&#13;
transition on the poor or vulnerable, and to rehabilitate a major coal mine.&#13;
1.5   By the end of 1996, the economy appeared to have weathered the worst of the&#13;
shocks, but is still fragile. After suffering negative growth during 1991-93, GDP grew by&#13;
2.5 percent in 1994 and 6.3 percent in 1995. But with a 33 percent decline in copper&#13;
prices and 10 percent drop in cashmere export prices, growth in the first half of 1996 fell&#13;
to less than 1 percent. Although major macroeconomic targets agreed with external&#13;
lenders are being met, the pace of reform slowed in 1995-96, and the challenges for the&#13;
policymakers remain daunting. Mongolia's leaders must: continue and deepen structural&#13;
reform; maintain satisfactory levels of income; reduce the poverty level; improve the&#13;
welfare of pensioners; and reduce inflation. Though down from its 1993 high of about&#13;
325 percent, inflation was still about 50 to 60 percent in 1995/96, primarily due to loose&#13;
monetary and fiscal policies, excessive bank and government credit creation, weak budget&#13;
revenue generation and defaults on debt payments by state enterprises. Two recently&#13;
approved IDA projects aimed at banking and enterprise reform should help with some of&#13;
these problems.&#13;
1.6   Mongolia's new national government, elected in mid-1996, has announced a&#13;
wide-ranging, accelerated reform agenda. The major objectives are to: (a) speed up&#13;
company privatization; (b) reduce tax burdens on producers by 30 percent; (c) improve&#13;
tax administration and broaden the tax base; (d) promote foreign investment; (e) improve&#13;
foreign assistance coordination; (f) refocus social security on the most needy; (g) reduce&#13;
govermnent expenditure and, to achieve better governance, prepare a code of ethics for all&#13;
government members.&#13;
1.7   By end-1996, the Government had already implemented some courageous sectoral&#13;
and macroeconomic reforms conforming with the goals outlined above. These included:&#13;
(a) raising electricity and heating tariffs by 60 percent; coal prices by 45 percent and&#13;
petroleum prices by 29 to 60 percent; (b) abolishing price commissions that were&#13;
controlling prices of basic commodities in major urban centers; (c) enacting new laws on&#13;
central and commercial banking operations; and (d) reducing the number of ministries&#13;
and departments from 16 to 9.&#13;
B. THE URBAN SETTING&#13;
Urbanization in Mongolia&#13;
1.8   Of the national population of 2.32 million in 1995, about 55 percent were urban.&#13;
Overall population growth in the 1990s has been about 2 percent a year, while urban&#13;
growth averaged only 1 percent but was concentrated in the three largest cities, as smaller&#13;
rural centers declined. Political and economic changes in the 1990s are believed to have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
caused increased migration to the larger urban areas at the expense of the smaller towns.&#13;
Currently, about a quarter of the population or an estimated 620,000 people lives in the&#13;
capital city of Ulaanbaatar (UB), and another 25 percent lives in other urban centers,&#13;
including the three next largest cities-Darhan with 91,300, Erdenet with 62,900 and&#13;
Choibalsan with 46,400. Except for those living in the capitals of the country's 17&#13;
aimags or provinces, averaging 20,300 each, most other people live in widely dispersed,&#13;
and much smaller, urban centers, essentially large villages.&#13;
Urban Services Delivery&#13;
1.9    Mongolia's cities bear the imprint of socialist urban planning, that is, a reliance on&#13;
rigid physical norms with little regard to user demand, technological alternatives, or&#13;
realistic resource constraints. The upshot of these policies has been lopsided urban&#13;
development. The combination of high standards for publicly-financed formal housing&#13;
and urban services and inadequate resources to provide such housing and services to all&#13;
city residents stranded a large segment of the urban population in self-financed housing in&#13;
plotted developments, where standards of facilities and services are much lower than&#13;
those in the formal housing areas. The traditional housing areas, known as ger areas,&#13;
comprise individually fenced plots and clusters of traditional round tents (gers)1 and/or&#13;
assorted low-cost structures ranging from wooden shacks to a scattering of two-story&#13;
brick houses.&#13;
1.10   Ger Area Services. Due to their supposedly temporary nature, the ger areas have&#13;
received the bare minimum of infrastructure investment, usually only individual&#13;
electricity connections and communal water collection points. The ger areas lack other&#13;
basic services, such as paved, or at least stabilized access roads, community services,&#13;
piped water supply and sanitation. Pit latrines are universal, and coal, wood or dung-fired&#13;
stoves are used for heating and cooking. There are generally few communal social&#13;
facilities. Local governments lay out and allot the individual plots to residents, with an&#13;
occupation right of unspecified duration. Whereas industries and apartments generally lie&#13;
within the serviced areas, most ger housing areas fall outside the piped water and&#13;
sewerage systems. Instead, ger residents must rely on water expensively trucked to and&#13;
sold from public water kiosks. And, while apartment residents obtain almost all their&#13;
services from public entities at highly subsidized prices, most services in the ger are&#13;
charged at full cost. This continues to hold true even though the ger areas house the&#13;
largest part of the urban poor, who constitute about 46 percent of the ger population. The&#13;
average income of ger households varies by location, but is estimated to be about $65&#13;
equivalent, or about 70 percent of average household income in the formal serviced areas.&#13;
1.11  In recent years, ger areas have tended to develop without control, because&#13;
newcomers generally identify a plot first and only afterward regularize occupancy with&#13;
I Ger tents have light, demountable wooden frame construction covered by several layers of felt and&#13;
canvas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the local government administration. This results in occupancy of land unsuited for&#13;
residential use and difficult or expensive to provide with infrastructure or services. Such&#13;
is the case with gers situated on steep slopes, near hilltops above the reach of water&#13;
supply reservoirs, and in areas subject to flooding. In the future, the local authorities will&#13;
need to enforce controls on new settlement and clearly indicate the land open to new&#13;
settlement. The low density of the ger areas (at 10 plots/hectare-ha) and their spread&#13;
over an increasing area cannot continue as this also makes delivery of urban services&#13;
difficult and expensive. In this regard, the proposed project would include a study of ger&#13;
development planning in UB.&#13;
1.12  Urban Services in the Formal Housing Sector. With the important exception of&#13;
the ger areas, Mongolia has a reasonable-but possibly unaffordable-level of urban&#13;
services, mostly built over the past 20 years.&#13;
*  Over 100 piped water systems are operated in all centers, generally from deep&#13;
wells. These systems, augmented by tankered water outside the distribution&#13;
systems, serve about 81 percent of the urban population.&#13;
*  Major cities, two provincial centers and large towns are served by sewerage&#13;
systems and associated sewage treatment. Water and sewerage and other&#13;
services are handled by the same unit-whether a municipal company in cities&#13;
or a municipal department in large towns.&#13;
* Solid waste management is handled by the local governments. All urban&#13;
centers are served with some type of solid waste collection system.&#13;
1.13  Service Quality. The quality of the urban services provided has deteriorated&#13;
badly, in part because of the economic retrenchment and deep cuts in government&#13;
spending for maintenance. Since 1990, most capital investment and expansion projects&#13;
have been halted, and even minor repairs of existing assets has been severely curtailed.&#13;
In general, the formal utility services face severe equipment problems. All equipment&#13;
originated from FSU countries and is now difficult to replace or maintain with spares&#13;
because of the severance of relationships with previous suppliers and inadequate hard&#13;
currency to pay for imports. For instance, more than 10 percent of the wells in the well&#13;
fields supplying UB are inoperative due to faulty pumps; the municipal sewage plant&#13;
treats only 75 percent of the sewage due to defective pumps and equipment; and pipe&#13;
breaks take three to four days to repair due to lack of materials and equipment.&#13;
1.14  Low levels of cost recovery, typical of the Soviet era when users contributed little&#13;
and utilities received substantial subsidies for new investments, have exacerbated service&#13;
delivery problems. Metering-whether of water, heat, or power-on apartment blocks or&#13;
individual premises is almost nonexistent. Water and sewerage are billed on the basis of&#13;
low assumed consumption norms, and collection of bills may be as low as 50 percent in&#13;
the aimags and 80 percent in UB. While tariff levels cover full costs of the present low&#13;
level of operations and depreciation, they are insufficient to cover the costs of adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- D -&#13;
levels of maintenance and rehabilitation, much less new investments in the systems.&#13;
Recovery of solid wastes service costs is limited and has led to deteriorating and&#13;
unsatisfactory collection and disposal services. Solid waste is disposed to sites operated&#13;
as open dumps, accepting mixed industrial, institutional and domestic wastes, and having&#13;
no environmental controls. The lack of funds has also affected the staff working in the&#13;
sector, who have not benefited from training in efficient operational procedures.&#13;
1.15  The lack of maintenance and the overall deterioration in standards have also had&#13;
environmental repercussions. Industrial sewage is being discharged directly to rivers, and&#13;
aquifers used for cities' water supply are beginning to show pollution from heavy metals&#13;
and high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand. The Government's (draft) National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan places high priority on addressing these problems. Unless&#13;
urgent remedial steps are taken, the cost of restoring reliable urban services and a&#13;
sustainable environment is likely to rise sharply.&#13;
C. SECTOR INSTITUTIONS&#13;
Ministry of Infrastructure Development&#13;
1.16  The Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) has been responsible for&#13;
public services policy since 1994. MID has broad responsibilities, ranging from tourism&#13;
to coal mining and including the Department of Urban Development, Housing and Public&#13;
Utilities. The latter is responsible for: (a) formulating urban development policies;&#13;
(b) preparing the legal framework for urban development, housing, public services;&#13;
management coordination and inspection; (c) planning the funding of public services, and&#13;
(d) managing design and research and provision of government expertise. Reflecting the&#13;
importance now being given to municipal services by Mongolia's new National&#13;
government, in January 1997 a formerly semiautonomous government company, the&#13;
State Concern for Municipal Utilities, was absorbed in MID and renamed the Urban&#13;
Services Agency. Public utility companies in the provincial (aimag) centers and the&#13;
water supply and sewerage company in UB have to date been only nominally coordinated&#13;
by the Ministry; real responsibility rested with the local municipalities and aimag&#13;
governors.&#13;
D. GOVERNMENT SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.17  After little action on the urban front since 1991 due to the economic crisis, the&#13;
Government's sector policies are being reinvigorated with a market orientation. In&#13;
December 1996, Parliament approved important Directives for the Economic and Social&#13;
Development of Mongolia, providing for (a) the drafting of a law on a real estate tax,&#13;
(b) implementation of land ownership measures and procedures, (c) an inventory and&#13;
evaluation of state-owned fixed assets, including property, (d) development of a housing&#13;
program, with new standards, and the resolution of problems relating to the financing of&#13;
private housing, and (e) renovation of water supply and sewerage facilities in cities and&#13;
settlements and improvement in their maintenance and levels of service. A Government&#13;
plan also exists to concentrate settlement and national infrastructure development around&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
five regional growth poles (including UB), supported by transport, communications and&#13;
energy corridors.&#13;
1.18  The new development policy is consistent with a draft statement of Mongolia's&#13;
urban development policy in its Medium-Term Strategy. The Strategy recognizes the&#13;
need for: (a) private sector and individual initiatives, not the Government, in replacing&#13;
ger housing; (b) better public provision of water supply and sanitation to the urban&#13;
population to improve productivity and quality of life and to reduce poverty; and (c) cost&#13;
recovery for the infrastructure services provided. The policy action matrix included in&#13;
the Strategy, similar to some of the goals of the proposed IDA project, would: (a) provide&#13;
water supply services to ger areas around UB; (b) establish effective demand&#13;
management (pricing) mechanisms that reflect the scarcity value of water resources; and&#13;
(c) improve sector planning in peri-urban areas.  While resource limitations-both&#13;
financial and human-may temper the implementation of the Strategy, the Government&#13;
seems prepared to expand the reforms already introduced in other areas of the economy to&#13;
the water supply sector. To this end, it is exploring ways to enhance its operational and&#13;
financial efficiencies while mitigating the inequality between ger areas and the apartment&#13;
sector. The proposed project would support both goals.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
1.19  The proposed project supports three major goals of the Bank Group's June 1995&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), i.e., to protect the poor and other groups vulnerable&#13;
to the effects of the country's economic transition, improve economic infrastructure, and&#13;
promote a commercial orientation in local public enterprises. By delivering water supply&#13;
and other urban services to predominantly poor ger areas in UB, the project supports both&#13;
the Bank Group's objective of poverty alleviation in the country, and the Government's&#13;
own Poverty Alleviation Program launched in 1994 to reduce the proportion of the&#13;
population living below the poverty line and ease the social burden of structural reforms&#13;
introduced during the transition to a market economy. By improving UB's water&#13;
distribution network to benefit ger, apartment and other areas, the project responds to&#13;
immediate urban infrastructure requirements that have gone unmet due to severe funding&#13;
shortages. Project assistance for development and corporatization of UB's water supply&#13;
and sewerage utility is expected to strengthen the economic and financial management of&#13;
the system and facilitate the utility's development as a fully commercial entity. The&#13;
project would also introduce market-oriented provisions for, and management of, urban&#13;
services by providing better cost-recovery mechanisms as well as financial incentives for&#13;
water conservation and operational efficiency.&#13;
1.20 The project directly supports the Government's recently announced sector&#13;
strategy (para. 1.17) and complements other IDA-funded initiatives in Mongolia as well&#13;
as those financed by other donors. It builds on recommendations of IDA's 1994 informal&#13;
sector review, carried out as part of project identification, findings of the 1996 Mongolia&#13;
Poverty Assessment (Report No. 15723-MOG) and the Poverty Alleviation for&#13;
Vulnerable Groups Project (Cr. 2760-MN) now assisting the unemployed, disabled and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7-&#13;
poor women and children; the success for the ongoing implementation of this latter&#13;
project critically depends on the association of the Poverty Program Office with the local&#13;
Group Associations. In its goal of reducing water losses in UB, it complements a&#13;
proposed similar operation in the power sector to reduce energy losses in the capital.&#13;
Project initiatives also share goals of similar work being done by other multi- and&#13;
bilateral agencies, particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency&#13;
(JICA). All three are funding small water supply, sanitation and ger area improvement&#13;
schemes in other areas of the country, and JICA is supporting UB's rehabilitation of&#13;
water supply facilities; it also supports preparation of a drainage master plan for UB and,&#13;
in future, is expected to finance priority works under the plan.&#13;
F. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS&#13;
1.21  The Association has assisted Mongolia with three projects providing balance of&#13;
payments or technical assistance support, two for structural adjustment of the banking&#13;
and enterprise sectors, two for rehabilitation of the transport system and of the Baganuur&#13;
coal mine near UB, and one for protection of vulnerable groups during this difficult&#13;
period. The principal lesson leamed from these operations is the lack of local familiarity&#13;
with basic project activities like procurement and disbursement, which can result in&#13;
significant project startup delays and slower-than-expected progress thereafter. AusAID-&#13;
funded assistance for preparation of the project, therefore, included preparation of major&#13;
procurement packages for the first two project years.  A  four-member project&#13;
management team of intemational consultants would also assist the Project Management&#13;
Unit during the first 18 to 24 months of implementation. Such assistance should&#13;
accelerate project startup and build local capabilities. In addition, counterpart funding&#13;
constraints experienced under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2615, approved in&#13;
May 1994), due to the imposition during implementation of import duties and sales tax&#13;
on project inputs, would be avoided by including these taxes in the project cost estimate&#13;
and budgetary planning by the Central and Municipal Govermnent to provide the full&#13;
local funding requirement.&#13;
1.22  Experience gained outside of Mongolia has also influenced Project design. In a&#13;
review of urban projects in the past 20 years, the Operations Evaluation Department's&#13;
report "Twenty Years of Lending for Urban Development" stresses the importance of:&#13;
(a) ensuring ownership of the project through participation of beneficiaries from the early&#13;
stages to improve project design and reveal effective demand; (b) enhancing service&#13;
delivery efficiency in a sustainable way through cost recovery, based on effective&#13;
demand; and (c) making more efficient use of the existing infrastructure before&#13;
developing additional networks, as part of the borrower's clear understanding of&#13;
investment priorities.&#13;
1.23  The proposed project incorporates these lessons.  First, to ensure project&#13;
ownership, ger area leaders and representatives discussed their needs with the project&#13;
preparation team during several stages of the preparation process. And, to prepare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
stakeholders to assume responsibility for management and financial reforms under the&#13;
project's institutional development component, during project preparation key utility&#13;
managers and staff participated in a study tour of major utilities being successfully&#13;
operated on commercial principles in neighboring countries. The positive feedback from&#13;
the latter exercise should strengthen commitments to the project's reform agenda.&#13;
Second, efficiency gains and cost recovery are key aims of the project's institutional and&#13;
financial development activities. Third, the project is posited on maximizing the use of&#13;
existing facilities rather than constructing new ones. Proposed water supply system&#13;
investments would utilize existing underused reservoirs to reduce water supply costs,&#13;
while the project's provision of some 13,000 water meters would enhance water&#13;
conservation, reduce water supply costs, and alleviate the need for new system expansion&#13;
during the next five years. Finally, project improvements in the ger areas will have&#13;
accompanying environmental benefits due to improved sanitation and solid waste&#13;
collection facilities.&#13;

2. URBAN SERVICES IN ULAANBAATAR&#13;
A. ULAANBAATAR: How IT HAS DEVELOPED&#13;
2.1   Ulaanbaatar, with about 620,000 people in 1995 or 27 percent of the national&#13;
population, is Mongolia's capital and the country's foremost city, having 42 percent of&#13;
commercial activity, 50 percent of housing and 52 percent of investment activity. Since&#13;
about 1970, its population has doubled, having grown at an annual average 6.8 percent in&#13;
the 1970s, at more modest rates in the 1980s, and at about 2 percent in the 1990s. UB&#13;
comprises six contiguous districts (duureg) and two districts enclaved in the adjoining&#13;
province-the mining town of Baganuur about 100 km away and a former military base&#13;
south of the city. While UB officially encompasses a total area of some 354,300 ha, the&#13;
built-up areas account for only 20,000 ha. The site of the present city, lying between the&#13;
Tuul River flood plain and the Khentii mountains, has been inhabited since ancient times.&#13;
2.2  In the 1950s, the Government promoted development of the industrial power&#13;
stations in the UB region, demolished much of the traditional settlements in the central&#13;
city area and erected apartment blocks in their place to house the inhabitants, together&#13;
with a skilled work force from Russia. The city plan prepared at that time, and its&#13;
subsequent modifications, envisaged the construction of a modem city of functionally&#13;
distinct zones, large-scale infrastructure and rented housing of four- to eight-story&#13;
apartment blocks. From the 1950s through the 1980s, this plan was substantially&#13;
implemented using the Government's control of production, construction, employment&#13;
and population movement. However, since the democratic reforms, these controls have&#13;
been loosened, costs and prices have risen, but unemployment has sharply increased and&#13;
for most people, real income has dropped. Due to these factors and to privatization of&#13;
industries, Government revenues have declined, as has its ability to limit in-migration or&#13;
maintain the pace of infrastructure construction to accommodate the rising growth of&#13;
population and small-scale enterprises.&#13;
2.3   Due to these economic and political changes, apartment building has now almost&#13;
stopped, and the majority of urban growth is in the ger areas surrounding the core&#13;
"apartment city." The future of Ulaanbaatar seems to be in "ger development," gers&#13;
being, in effect, low-cost suburban settlements. Families wishing to obtain a plot apply&#13;
to the local khoroo (the smallest level of the city administration) and are allocated a&#13;
300 m  or 500 m2 lot located and staked out by a survey from the city. Most new&#13;
residents obtain land in this way, although there is an increasingly active real estate&#13;
market. Only 10 percent of the plots are occupied by unregistered squatters. The&#13;
government-owned land and the region's semidesert, uncultivated landscape allow rapid&#13;
expansion of ger development with few legal or natural constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.4   The individual plots are laid out in simple rectangular blocks with wide public&#13;
rights-of-way between plots. The plot-holders construct wooden fences around their&#13;
plots, then erect the ger tent, possibly a conventional wood frame permanent building,&#13;
and a pit privy toilet. Between one and four families may live on this plot, and one or&#13;
more of the families may periodically move to herd livestock in rural areas, then return to&#13;
their urban ger. Many families keep livestock on their plots or on the hills nearby.&#13;
Livestock forms a significant part of household incomes, especially since the reduction of&#13;
secure formal employment.&#13;
2.5   Socioeconomic surveys of ger residents in UB indicate that, although household&#13;
incomes are low (median income is $76 month for an average size household of 4.8),&#13;
income distribution is still fairly even (a positive legacy from the Communist period),&#13;
although it is gradually becoming more skewed as the market economy takes hold.&#13;
2.6   Despite the economic problems, UB has a number of advantages over other&#13;
capital cities in the developing world. It is not yet too large to be unmanageable. There&#13;
is no widespread squatting, and the settlement process is fairly orderly. Settlement&#13;
densities are fairly low, allowing scope to introduce services, and ger plot sites are large&#13;
enough to permit incremental housing development and for residents to obtain a valuable&#13;
future real estate asset. Distribution of income and assets (including urban land) is, as&#13;
yet, fairly equal, and social divisions (regional, ethnic, religious) are insignificant.&#13;
Literacy and education levels are high, potentially allowing informed dialogue and&#13;
participation in issues of urban planning, management and development.&#13;
B. URBAN SERVICE PROVISION IN MODERN AND TRADITIONAL HOUSING AREAS&#13;
2.7   The Modern Sector. About 55 percent of UB's population lives in fully-serviced&#13;
public housing estates, comprised of 3- to 12-story apartment buildings in prefabricated&#13;
modular construction. The housing estates, clustered near the city center and along the&#13;
city's main roads, are relatively well-served by public transport. The apartments have&#13;
cold and hot water, toilets and bathrooms, conventional piped sewage collection, on-site&#13;
and off-site piped stormwater drainage, electricity, water heating, elevators in higher&#13;
buildings and solid waste collection from apartment chutes. USAG, the municipal water&#13;
supply and sewerage company, provides cold water to the housing sites; and hot water is&#13;
generated in community heating centers on the housing sites. Apartment rents and utility&#13;
charges have until recently been heavily subsidized.&#13;
2.8   Ger Areas. The remainder of the population or some 250,000 to 270,000 people&#13;
live in 18 ger areas that sprawl mainly over the outlying hills and valleys to the north,&#13;
northwest and northeast of UB, several kilometers from the city's economic activity.&#13;
Densities in these areas are low, primarily due to the large plot sizes and the sporadic&#13;
distribution of ger settlements. At these low densities, the cost of servicing ger areas is&#13;
high, especially for roads and water supply. While the proposed project would extend&#13;
piped water supply to public water kiosks in ger areas, individual household connections&#13;
are currently unaffordable to most families. A greater problem exists when ger plots are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
extended higher than the existing water reservoirs (the highest being 1,470 m). Above&#13;
this level, the current pressure in the water system cannot service kiosks in the areas.&#13;
2.9   The higher cost of providing municipal services to the ger areas does not explain&#13;
the minimal level of services there, which contrast sharply with the European-style,&#13;
middle-income standard of the apartments. Ger services are generally as follows:&#13;
*  excreta are generally disposed to pit latrines, and sullage to the ground and&#13;
natural drainage channels;&#13;
*  access is via rough, poorly-bridged earth roads. The wide rights-of-way are&#13;
often eroded by stormwater flows;&#13;
*  there is virtually no formal stormwater drainage system;&#13;
*  solid waste is sporadically collected from bins at the end of residential lanes&#13;
by local municipal workers;&#13;
-  high heating costs, in individual private wood or coal stoves, can consume&#13;
about 10 percent of average household expenditure;&#13;
-  housing is solely by private household investment and, to be affordable to low&#13;
ger incomes, is mostly in poorly-insulated wooden shacks or the traditional&#13;
nomadic tent-the ger;&#13;
-  water is supplied from neighborhood kiosks filled by public tanker trucks;&#13;
3  some schools have been built but virtually no community centers, health&#13;
clinics, or recreation areas. There are few shops or consumer markets, and the&#13;
latter are unsanitary and create local traffic congestion;&#13;
*  private transport is the dominant mode due to infrequent and low-density&#13;
public bus service; and&#13;
*  the failed privatization of ger bath houses nearly eliminated washing facilities&#13;
in the ger (currently only a few of the original 20 bathhouses are operating).&#13;
2.10  The inadequacy of public services to the ger is reflected in significant health&#13;
differences between ger and apartment dwellers. A 1993 UNICEF nutrition survey found&#13;
that infants born into ger area families had a 60 percent higher risk of low weight than&#13;
those born in apartments. Further, the incidence of diarrhea and acute respiratory&#13;
infections in ger children under five is about double the rate of children in apartments. A&#13;
ger household survey carried out during preparation of the proposed project indicates an&#13;
average household size of five people, with a median income of about Tug 53,200 a&#13;
month (about $76 at the current exchange rate), more than half of which is spent for food.&#13;
An estimated 30 percent of Ulaanbaatar's ger population live below the poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
C. WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION&#13;
The Network and Operations&#13;
2.11  Water Supply and Distribution. Most of UB's raw water supply is from four&#13;
groundwater extraction wellfields on an aquifer near the south-central part of the city at&#13;
an altitude of about 1,100 m. Streams from adjacent hills maintain the aquifer, thus&#13;
development, especially highly polluting land uses such as solid waste dumps, industry,&#13;
etc., needs to be located away from  these areas and adjacent slopes.  About&#13;
160,000 m3/day of water is supplied. Tests indicate that water quality in the sources is&#13;
good, and water pumped from the wells is only lightly chlorinated at the well heads.&#13;
From there, the water is pumped through distribution pipelines to industry, some&#13;
government buildings, to a water trucking operation delivering to ger water kiosks, and to&#13;
Central Heating Points (CTPs) that deliver hot-water heating as well as hot and cold&#13;
running water to apartments. A Japanese grant under discussion (para. 1.20) will provide&#13;
some equipment and meters in 1997 to assist in the monitoring of CTPs.&#13;
2.12  About 55 percent of the population, mostly in apartment blocks, is served by a&#13;
piped water supply. The distribution network consists of about 300 km of unlined steel&#13;
or cast iron pipes, ranging from 150 to 700 mm in diameter. Pipe trench depths are&#13;
generally between 2 and 3 m, in order to avoid freezing in UB's cold winters when&#13;
average daily temperatures range from -13 to -25°C. The currently inadequate service,&#13;
with intermittent flows and pressures, would be improved under the proposed project.&#13;
Details of the UB water supply system are given in Annex 1.&#13;
2.13  Reservoirs. The existing reservoir system is both underutilized (by half of its&#13;
capacity) and unintegrated, to the detriment of water pressure in the system as well as&#13;
service coverage. With three commissioned reservoirs (the Northwest, the "3/4 district"&#13;
and the Tasgan) in the hills north and east of UB not linked to each other, and two&#13;
completed reservoirs (the Northwest and the "X") not yet commissioned, system capacity&#13;
is far from being fully utilized to provide adequate system storage or gravity system&#13;
pressure. And none of the reservoirs, except the easternmost, are high enough to service&#13;
by gravity the large ger population in a large valley north of UB. For the most part,&#13;
pressure is maintained in the network by direct pumping from the well-head sources.&#13;
However, many areas suffer from inadequate water supply and pressure, and facilities&#13;
serving high-rise apartment blocks are not equipped to boost-pump water to the higher&#13;
floors in nine-story buildings. The proposed project would increase system efficiency&#13;
and improve pressure and service by bringing the unused reservoirs into operation and&#13;
constructing a transmission main to link four reservoirs to a new section of the city&#13;
supply network, also to be constructed under the project. Additional reservoirs would&#13;
also be constructed to provide a piped water supply to local ger communities.&#13;
2.14 Water Demand. The inequity of water supply in UB is indicated by the system's&#13;
skewed demand figures, which show about 55 percent of the population receiving about&#13;
75 percent of the piped water supply and 45 percent of the population (in ger) receiving a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
mere 1.3 percent of the total. In 1995, water demand in UB totaled about 161,935 m3/d,&#13;
of which 121,532 m3/d was from apartments (296,420 persons at 410 lcd), 38,159 m3/d&#13;
from industry, and 2,244 m3/d from ger residents (224,443 persons at 10 lcd). While&#13;
UB's 74,000 apartments with hot and cold running water housed about 323,000 in 1995,&#13;
not all were supplied from the municipal network. Projections of future demand in the&#13;
year 2010 assume an average annual population growth of about 2.25 percent for&#13;
apartments dwellers, an apartment population of about 415,000 persons, and water&#13;
consumption at 320 lcd to reflect an increase in the standard of living and use of&#13;
appliances such as family washing machines. The ger population is expected to expand&#13;
at about an annual average 2.25 percent, reaching some 313, 800 in 2010 and consuming&#13;
about 25 lcd by that time. On this basis, water supply demand in 2010 would total some&#13;
217,600 m3/d, 7,840 m3/d from the ger, 132,630 m3/d from apartments and 77,137 m3/d&#13;
from nonresidential and industrial users.&#13;
2.15  Wastage. Studies indicate that about 30 percent of the 410 lcd (125 lcd) supplied&#13;
to apartments is wasted in water losses from leaking plumbing fixtures in apartments.&#13;
Since residential consumers' charges are based on norms rather than actual metered&#13;
consumption and USAG's low flat charges absorb only a small percentage of household&#13;
income, there are no incentives in the current system to conserve water. USAG receives&#13;
no revenue for an estimated 50 percent of the water it produces.&#13;
2.16  Ger Water Supply. Water to the ger areas is supplied by trucks drawing mostly&#13;
from USAG water stations, and service is unreliable, inconsistent and expensive, to both&#13;
the city and the residents. Ger dwellers are forced to get supplementary water from&#13;
elsewhere-rivers, surface water sources that can be polluted, wells or rainwater. The&#13;
tanker service is operated by TANK, a separate USAG department. The trucked-in water&#13;
is stored in tanks at 262 coal-stove-heated public water kiosks in the ger neighborhoods,&#13;
which are supposed to operate for about eight hours a day. Access to some kiosks is very&#13;
difficult and in adverse weather conditions tankers fail to supply the kiosks, forcing them&#13;
to close and leaving the ger residents unserved. A shortage or lack of heating fuel,&#13;
freezing or the absence of an attendant can also close the kiosks. The attendants,&#13;
employed by TANK, collect tokens from ger purchasers for a specific volume of water,&#13;
which the purchasers draw from a pipe at the kiosk. USAG/TANK charge the full cost of&#13;
tankered water to the ger. For water drawn from kiosks the price is Tug 400/'000 liter (in&#13;
1997)-about 20 times the Tug 20/'000 liter price paid by apartment residents in 1995&#13;
and 12 times the Tug 34/'000 liter tariff introduced in January 1997.&#13;
2.17  Water is usually fetched by women and children over a distance of 200 to 500 m,&#13;
in hand carts from kiosks to homes, over mostly rough, hilly, earth paths and roads. In&#13;
the winter, ice and snow impede access to the kiosks by both tanker trucks and ger&#13;
residents and water supply is erratic. Ger consumption from kiosks is about 7.5 to&#13;
10.0 lcd; the amount is limited by both cost and the difficulty of transporting the water&#13;
and is well below the minimum requirement for good health and sanitation, generally&#13;
considered to be 20 lcd. The total water supplied by TANK to ger areas, although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
probably underestimated by USAG, is only 2,244 m3/day, not even 2 percent of USAG's&#13;
daily demand.&#13;
2.18  Sewerage.  UB's apartment housing estates and institutional premises are&#13;
connected to a conventional 80 km underground sewer system operated by USAG. Most&#13;
industrial wastewater is discharged to the public sewerage system. The discharges are&#13;
expected to meet certain standards, but the latter are not rigorously enforced. An&#13;
industrial wastewater pretreatment plant of a 20,000 m3/day capacity exists but the plant&#13;
is old and not operating fully nor efficiently. It serves the wool and leather industries but&#13;
due to poor performance, outflow from the plant and into the domestic sewerage system&#13;
is likely to exceed standards.  The data maintained measure few of the relevant&#13;
parameters but still show an effluent quality inconsistent with discharge standards to&#13;
public sewers (particularly for the one heavy metal measured). If industrial wastewater&#13;
does not satisfy discharge standards, the Municipality has powers to close the operation,&#13;
require three times normal sewerage charges and impose other sanctions. This is rarely&#13;
done, however.&#13;
2.19  The entire city sewerage system flows by gravity to a single sewage treatment&#13;
plant (STP) for domestic and industrial wastewater streams located 11 km west of the city&#13;
center. The STP was designed to treat 230,000 m 3/day, and actual flows are in the range&#13;
of 150,000 m3/day. Only a proportion (perhaps 80 percent) of water consumed is likely&#13;
to reach the sewerage system, at least 60,000 m3/day is from industrial wastewater and&#13;
infiltration. The current sewage flow is very close to the amount of USAG water&#13;
produced, and confirms that system losses are recovered in the sewers.&#13;
2.20  The STP provides primary, secondary and tertiary treatment stages. Primary and&#13;
physical treatment components of the plant were constructed in 1963 and 1968, with the&#13;
biological treatment [diffused air activated sludge plant (ASP)] added in 1979. There are&#13;
also tertiary treatment ponds and chlorination facilities, although these are not&#13;
operational. In addition, problems are being experienced with some of the equipment.&#13;
2.21  Treated wastewater flows from the main treatment plant are discharged to the&#13;
Tuul River south of UB's developed area. Although still satisfactory, there has been a&#13;
noticeable downward trend in effluent quality. The plant experiences problems due to the&#13;
absence of standby generation; in the event of power failure the entire raw domestic and&#13;
industrial wastewater flows are diverted directly to the river. This also occurs when&#13;
pump breakdown causes the flow rate to exceed operational pumping capacity. Operation&#13;
control is made more difficult by the absence of operating flow meters. There is a need to&#13;
rehabilitate most of the electromechanical equipment and the primary system of&#13;
degritting and desilting and IDA is assisting the Government to identify appropriate&#13;
advice and financial support for those investments.&#13;
2.22  Sewer charges in 1997 are Tug 34/'000 liters (Tug 20 1996) for apartment&#13;
dwellers and Tug 97/'000 liters (Tug 50 in 1996) for industrial, institutional and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
major generators, at 100 percent of the normative volume charged for water. The charges&#13;
are added to customers' water bills issued by USAG on the kantors.&#13;
2.23  With the lack of investment over recent years, the sewerage system, like the water&#13;
supply system, is deteriorating. In particular, there is an urgent need for rehabilitation of&#13;
critical lengths of sewer and key items of equipment, particularly pumps.&#13;
D. SOLID WASTE SERVICES&#13;
2.24  Solid waste collection and disposal are responsibilities of the Municipality of&#13;
Ulaanbaatar (MUB), which devolves collections to its six duureg (Districts) and disposal&#13;
to the Ulaanbaatar Waste Disposal Company (NUUTS), a wholly municipal-owned&#13;
company. Each duureg has established a General Maintenance Company (GMC)&#13;
responsible for refuse collection, street cleaning, park and green area maintenance and&#13;
development, and maintenance of public buildings and grounds. The GMCs collect&#13;
refuse from ger areas, apartment and public buildings and private and state-controlled&#13;
industrial organizations. In ger areas, GMCs make bulk collections from local disposal&#13;
areas and some individual lots. There are also many informal tip sites from which GMCs&#13;
also collect refuse.&#13;
2.25  As for water and sewerage and other utilities, apartment occupants are billed each&#13;
month for solid waste services at a per capita rate of Tug 50 per apartment. Ger residents&#13;
are supposed to pay a collection fee determined by MUB/duureg, to ger leaders or&#13;
nominated collectors. The fees are passed to GMC, often via individual drivers. The&#13;
collection rate from the ger is relatively low and results in constantly declining refuse&#13;
collection amounts within ger areas.  There can be no improvement unless the&#13;
municipality allocates money from its general tax budget, or causes the duuregs and&#13;
khoroos to improve the solid waste fee collection. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that MUB will undertake a study to determine appropriate alternatives to&#13;
fund ger area refuse collection; by July 1, 1998, submit the study and recommendations&#13;
to the Association for comments; and by December 31, 1998, prepare an action plan&#13;
acceptable to the Association to implement the agreed recommendations.&#13;
2.26 NUUTS operates three disposal areas, all virtually unregulated dumping grounds&#13;
with no charges levied for dumping. NUUTS appears to be financed entirely by MUB.&#13;
A section within the MUB Construction and Planning Department monitors activities of&#13;
the duureg GMCs and works with duureg solid waste inspectors. It also can advise on&#13;
new collection methods and ensure that new developments are included in collection&#13;
schedules. This section also helps to clean up materials around new buildings.&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
A. MUNICIPALITY OF ULAANBAATAR&#13;
3.1   The proposed project would be implemented by the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar&#13;
(MUB). The current Mayor of Ulaanbaatar and his City Council took office in&#13;
September 1996, and moved quickly to reorganize the city administration and to&#13;
introduce pricing reforms. One aim of the reorganization was to centralize in the&#13;
Department of Strategic Planning responsibilities for urban services, formerly dispersed&#13;
among four separate departments. This centralization would facilitate implementation of&#13;
investments and programs to improve urban services in  accordance with the&#13;
Government's sector strategy as well as the Municipality's own four-year development&#13;
plan 1997-2000. Chart 1 shows the new municipal structure.&#13;
3.2   Of the four departments directly under the Mayor, the Department of Strategic&#13;
Planning and the Department under the General Manager are directly relevant to the&#13;
operations of municipal services. The General Manager's Department oversees activities&#13;
of all utilities under the Municipality, whether autonomous or separate departments with&#13;
their own budget. The General Manager monitors (a) USAG, which delivers water&#13;
supply and sewerage services; (b) Ulaanbaatar Housing and Communal Services&#13;
Company (OSNAAK) and its affiliate kantors, responsible for the housing sector and&#13;
maintenance activities; (c) six general maintenance companies responsible for solid&#13;
wastes collection in each duureg and NUUTS, the waste disposal company (para. 2.24);&#13;
and (d) bus companies. The Department of Strategic Planning controls four offices and&#13;
one Bureau: the Construction and Planning Office, in charge of infrastructure and&#13;
building designs; the Building and Investment Office, for large development projects; the&#13;
Land Office for definition of land use, and land allocation; and the Finance Bureau,&#13;
involved in of tariff revision. The municipal organization also includes representatives of&#13;
the six municipal districts (duureg), each encompassing both the apartments in the central&#13;
city and ger areas on the perimeter. Various services fall within the responsibilities of the&#13;
Municipality and the districts (see below). The duuregs are divided into khoroos, the&#13;
smallest administrative unit of the city government, headed by elected leaders. Since the&#13;
khoroo leaders are usually personally acquainted with most people living in their area,&#13;
they make excellent community contact points for local consultation and participation.&#13;
3.3   The Municipality formerly obtained most of its revenue from the operation of&#13;
companies and utilities under its control.  With the gradual loss of state-owned&#13;
enterprises, the corporatization of utilities and the withdrawal of subsidies and cost-free&#13;
projects following the fall of the Soviet Union, it now has little revenue to spend on&#13;
capital investments, either to renovate deteriorating infrastructure or to construct new&#13;
infrastructure to support city growth or to service the expanding ger areas. All land is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
currently owned by the Government, although arrangements are being made to privatize&#13;
ownership of individual apartments and to give long-term leases to registered ger plot-&#13;
holders. The prices of housing and the leases and whether they will form the basis of a&#13;
property tax have still to be decided by MUB.&#13;
3.4   Broad policies on land ownership and borrowing levels for the Municipality and&#13;
its Corporations are controlled by the Central Government and the Ministers of Finance&#13;
and Economic Development.  Within these constraints, the Municipality has a&#13;
considerable degree of autonomy for planning, provision and management of services.&#13;
3.5   The movement away from command and control in the Municipality's operations&#13;
to one where some services are delivered by largely autonomous agencies (e.g.,&#13;
electricity), while these remain government-delivered (roads, health and education), is&#13;
posing new challenges. These relate to financing municipal government and planning&#13;
and coordination of services, including an effective budgeting and financial management&#13;
system to ensure implementation of plans. Moreover, the emergence of democratic local&#13;
government and the orderly development of ger areas will require much stronger&#13;
participation of community and submunicipal (duureg and khoroo) levels of government&#13;
in decisions on matters such as zoning and land-use controls, and levels and pricing of&#13;
services. The proposed project's infrastructure development activities in five ger areas&#13;
would test this participatory approach for use in other areas.&#13;
3.6   To prepare itself for the challenges ahead, the Municipality plans to carry out a&#13;
study with funding sought from bilateral sources, of UB's long-term urban management&#13;
and planning strategy. That study would propose physical, institutional and financial&#13;
strategies to guide UB's future development, and to strengthen the capabilities of the&#13;
Municipality, city residents and the private sectors to plan and manage the city on an&#13;
ongoing basis. The outputs of the study will be: (a) a growth strategy and service plan&#13;
for the metropolitan region; (b) an institutional strengthening plan; and (c) a financial&#13;
management plan. Also included in the study is preparation of prototype ger area layouts,&#13;
including social services, infrastructure and alternative plot sites.  The alternatives&#13;
identified would be costed and the affordability to families of a plot development fund&#13;
assessed. Even now, UNDP is supporting a sustainable development program for&#13;
Mongolia-Agenda 2001, addressing urban planning, development, and environmental&#13;
issues. The study is expected to provide a national strategy that is similar to but broader&#13;
than the MUB study.&#13;
3.7   Study findings should assist the Municipality to continue its pursuit of market-&#13;
oriented policy reform. During the past year, MUB's commitment to economic&#13;
principles has been illustrated by authorizing long overdue increases in some utility&#13;
charges, including the water tariff, to cover operating costs, and formulating plans to&#13;
privatize apartments. It now intends to catalyze reforms in the water supply sector by&#13;
establishing USAG as a state-owned company under the 1995 Partnership and Company&#13;
Law. This and other reforms are changing the Municipality's role from one of direct&#13;
control over municipal services to one of policy setting and monitoring, with its policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
goals reflected in the strategic plans of the corporatized municipal services and in&#13;
provision of annual performance agreements concluded with the managers of those&#13;
services. Various funding agencies outside the scope of this project have expressed&#13;
interest in assisting the Municipality to implement the findings of the urban planning&#13;
study and to assist MUB in making the transition from direct provision of services to&#13;
oversight.&#13;
B. AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY SECTOR&#13;
3.8   The Municipality provides water supply and sewerage services through USAG,&#13;
which produces, treats and distributes water and collects and treats sewage. USAG&#13;
directly services government buildings, schools, hospitals, commercial premises and&#13;
some industries. However, domestic consumers receive USAG water through two other&#13;
organizations. A government-owned housing company, OSNAAK, and its affiliated&#13;
kantors (financially autonomous Housing and Communal Services Units) distribute water&#13;
to apartments, while TANK, a water tanker organization, services the ger areas. USAG is&#13;
fully owned by MUB as are OSNAAK, the kantors and TANK.&#13;
USAG&#13;
3.9   Powers and Authority. USAG was established and registered as a separate&#13;
company under the 1991 Economic Entities Law. USAG operates and maintains the&#13;
wells, pumps, primary distribution and reservoirs in the water supply system as well as&#13;
the pipes and treatment plant in the sewerage system (see Chart 2 for its organizational&#13;
structure). Secondary networks and service to the apartments is not under its jurisdiction.&#13;
System planning and capital investments, coverage of operational losses (if any) and&#13;
setting of tariffs and charges are all the responsibility of MUB. Although USAG&#13;
maintains separate accounts, as if it were a separate, autonomous, municipally-owned&#13;
company, and claims freedom to set its own wages and salaries, USAG operates narrowly&#13;
as if it were MUB's water supply and sewerage operations and maintenance department.&#13;
USAG's lack of autonomy over its operations has provided it with little incentive to take&#13;
responsibility for system operations, strategic planning and financial performance.&#13;
Consequently, USAG's analysis of existing and proposed water consumption and tariff&#13;
revenue is sketchy, particularly for industries and institutions. There is little technical&#13;
analysis of the water network to determine its capacity, shortcomings and efficiency.&#13;
And USAG seems to have little involvement in dealing with the related issues of system&#13;
water loss, the charging methods, tariff structure and revenue. An institutional study&#13;
carried out during project preparation indicated that USAG needed greater status and a&#13;
strengthened organization to become more efficient. The Municipality has concurred&#13;
with the recommendations of the study. To strengthen its accountability and encourage&#13;
performance improvements, USAG would be corporatized so that it may develop into a&#13;
somewhat more autonomous public utility with a clear mandate and legal status.&#13;
3.10  Staffing and Organizational Structure. USAG has a staff of 1,074 (including&#13;
442 in TANK). Using the traditional indicator of a water supply entity's efficiency, i.e.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
staff per system length, USAG appears to be overstaffed, with 1.66 persons per km of&#13;
network operated compared to the 0.45 staff per km typical of an efficient organization.&#13;
USAG is headed by a Director, under whom are a Chief Engineer responsible for all&#13;
system operation, and Heads of Departments for Material Supply, Planning and Finance,&#13;
Personnel and Consumers. Also part of USAG, but in fact operating almost separately&#13;
from it, is TANK. USAG's flat organizational structure indicates that decision-making is&#13;
centralized in its Director. With corporatization, the Director will be required to assume&#13;
more responsibilities for a more independent organization, and he will need to rely on a&#13;
strong management team  with which decision-making can be shared.  USAG's&#13;
restructuring into a more pyramidal organization is therefore recommended. Any&#13;
restructuring should also include the separation of USAG's now combined water and&#13;
sewerage operations, so that USAG can identify the costs and efficiency of each service&#13;
and the adequacy of tariffs for that service.&#13;
3.11  Maintenance.  Due to the insufficient tariff increases authorized by the&#13;
Municipality in the past, USAG has lacked adequate revenue to carry out system&#13;
maintenance. It currently has no regular maintenance procedures, and maintenance is&#13;
usually performed only when absolutely necessary. Now, with the revenues expected&#13;
from a substantial tariff increase in October 1996, funds should become available for a&#13;
much stepped-up maintenance program. Technical Assistance for developing adequate&#13;
maintenance purchase programs and procedures is included under the Project. During&#13;
negotiations, assurance was obtained that USAG will establish and operate a separate&#13;
maintenance account to provide an adequate level of maintenance and repair for its&#13;
facilities, and increase expenditures on maintenance in real terms starting in the fiscal&#13;
year beginning January 1, 1998, at IO percent in real terms, during the project period&#13;
3.12  Billing. About 1,060 institutional consumers, including industries, are billed&#13;
directly by USAG, which either reads meters, where they are installed and functioning,&#13;
or, for industrial consumers, bills them according to detailed consumption norms&#13;
determined by the type of organization and activity. While the current norms for&#13;
industrial users may closely reflect actual consumption, the system suffers from an&#13;
inherent lack of incentives to conserve water and should be replaced by metered billing to&#13;
charge actual volume consumed.&#13;
3.13  The introduction of metered billing is even more of a priority for apartment units.&#13;
The average norm of 150 lcd for billing to apartment dwellers is far below the actual&#13;
amount supplied, which surveys indicate is around 410 lcd. The bulk of the water over&#13;
the norm is simply wasted through leaking toilets and taps. The economic and financial&#13;
loss from this wastage is unsustainably high and should be stopped by an incentive&#13;
system to encourage conservation combined with repair of poorly functioning facilities&#13;
(see Annex 4). In addition to the installation of water meters at each apartment core,&#13;
replacement or installation of meters on USAG's own customers is included under the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.14  Financial Performance.   As discussed further in Chapter 5, despite&#13;
hyperinflation of about 5,700 percent overall in 1991-95, USAG was able to contain its&#13;
losses to 3 percent of total revenue in 1994 and to realize a small profit in 1995 by a&#13;
combination of tariff adjustments and reduction of operations in real terms. This&#13;
financial achievement masked serious problems in that USAG avoided major losses in&#13;
part by capping wages and almost totally neglecting system maintenance and investment.&#13;
The latter has sharply reduced the economic life of most assets, and rehabilitation of&#13;
facilities is now badly needed. In addition to the installation of water meters at each&#13;
apartment core, replacement or installation of meters on USAG's own customers is&#13;
included under the Project.&#13;
3.15  Effective in October 1996, USAG raised its water tariff to apartment dwellers by a&#13;
weighted average of 83 percent. This base tariff level, adjusted in the future for inflation,&#13;
would be adequate for USAG's operations in the medium term, until it needs to service&#13;
debt on the proposed credit or other future loans. Even with the increase, USAG's unit&#13;
charge to relatively poor ger area residents in 1997 is regressive by being about 12 times&#13;
higher than the unit charge to better-off apartment dwellers. The high charge also&#13;
prevents ger dwellers from consuming the minimum level of water required for health&#13;
and hygiene. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the gap between tariffs&#13;
to apartment and ger area residents will be phased out so that all consumers will pay the&#13;
same tariff when the piped water supply becomes available to ger area residents.&#13;
TANK&#13;
3.16 The TANK "Company" is a separate suborganization within USAG. It is&#13;
responsible for distributing water to ger areas, for which purpose it owns a fleet of 49&#13;
tanker trucks (mostly 5,000-liter capacity, only about 30 operational), tanker filling&#13;
stations and 262 sales kiosks. TANK has 442 staff. Kiosk attendants employed by&#13;
TANK dispense water in exchange for tokens TANK sells to consumers, charging Tug 8&#13;
per 20 liters. TANK, like USAG, is treated for accounting purposes as a separate entity,&#13;
but it functions only as a water supply and maintenance operation, with a quasi-&#13;
independent identity in relation to USAG. With respect to tariffs, investment and&#13;
operational policy, and sources of investment funds, it is wholly under MUB's direction.&#13;
TANK is not a separate income and expenditure center within USAG as it does not&#13;
purchase, or meter the water that it obtains from USAG for distribution to ger consumers.&#13;
3.17 USAG has insufficient control over TANK, which functions as a partly separate&#13;
organization within USAG. Due to its unsustainably high operating costs, TANK has&#13;
been losing money despite the very high tariff to ger residents and free water supply from&#13;
USAG. USAG has covered these losses, with the result that TANK is its second largest&#13;
item of expenditure after electricity, which accounts for over 70 percent of operating&#13;
costs. TANK's unit operating cost for water in 1996 constant terms is Tug 535/mr,&#13;
compared with Tug 33/m3 for the piped water system. The current arrangement also&#13;
appears open to waste and abuse as an analysis suggests that water supply through tank&#13;
operation seems underreported by half. Business hours at water kiosks are irregular and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
need to be regulated. The analysis of TANK's operations (Annex 12) shows that&#13;
replacing the tankered water supply with a piped supply, as would be done under the&#13;
proposed project, can significantly reduce USAG's operating costs while more than&#13;
doubling ger area resident's water supply to 20 lcd. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that the TANK activities will become integrated with those of USA G by the&#13;
time of completion of USAG's establishment as a corporation under Mongolia's 1995&#13;
Partnership and Company Law and no later than December 31, 1997. With this, TANK&#13;
staff would come under the control of appropriate USAG departments.&#13;
OSNAAKIKantors&#13;
3.18 Some 750 municipally-owned apartment buildings are managed by OSNAAK, a&#13;
wholly municipally-owned housing holding "Company." OSNAAK functions through&#13;
18 kantors, which actually operate and maintain the buildings and collects rents, provide&#13;
service connections for water and electricity, and collect utility user-charges that they&#13;
remit to the appropriate agency after retaining a service charge. OSNAAK and the&#13;
kantors are barely able to generate sufficient income to maintain the current apartments,&#13;
let alone to construct new units. Each kantor is responsible for an area of the city and&#13;
functions essentially as a housing management company for that area. Though in theory&#13;
OSNAAK and the kantors are financially independent, self-sustaining business&#13;
enterprises, they lack autonomy, and all major decisions affecting their operation, like the&#13;
determination of rents, capital investment, etc., are made by MUB. OSNAAK's total&#13;
manpower of around 60 consists essentially of advisers and supervisors monitoring the&#13;
kantors; the kantors have their staffing numbers established according to the number of&#13;
apartments they serve. The kantors are capable of carrying out plumbing repairs and&#13;
water meter installation under the proposed project.&#13;
3.19  The kantor housing estates receive USAG piped cold water and-via CTPs-hot&#13;
water for apartments and institutional premises. Prior to January 1997, MUB allowed the&#13;
kantors to collect USAG and other utility charges from apartments and institutions. For&#13;
collecting the water charges, the kantors retained about 25 percent of gross revenues. The&#13;
high percentage retained was apparently an indirect means of enhancing kantor revenues&#13;
to cover rising costs of operating and maintaining the (deteriorating) housing units and&#13;
their utilities in the absence of adequate increases in highly subsidized rents. However, as&#13;
decided by MUB, beginning January 1997, USAG receives all revenue collected by the&#13;
kantors as water and sewer charges, and the kantors can charge tenants an additional 20&#13;
percent of the USAG water and sewerage charge as a similar fee. The present system of&#13;
the kantors collecting apartments on behalf of USAG remains a satisfactory interim&#13;
solution, until USAG develops its own capacity and installs an adequate billing system.&#13;
C. SECTOR IMPROVEMENT ACTION PLAN&#13;
Municipal Objectives For the Sector&#13;
3.20 Both the Central Government and MUB agree on the need to renew and improve&#13;
urban services in the capital. For solid wastes, MUB believes that cost recovery is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
most appropriate form if ensuring revenues to cover operations, but wishes to review&#13;
principals and method of settling a collection fee. For water and sanitation, MUB seeks&#13;
to correct the most pressing problems and to introduce commercial principles in USAG,&#13;
thus extending to this sector the reforms being introduced in the city bus company and,&#13;
more boldly, in other areas of the economy. The Municipality has three major sectoral&#13;
goals. Regarding pricing and cost recovery, it intends to replace the current normative&#13;
system of charging with a quantitative system based on metered volumes and to fully&#13;
recover by user charges USAG's operating costs and the larger of its depreciation or debt&#13;
service costs. With respect to institutional strengthening, MUB supports the conversion&#13;
of USAG into a publicly-owned limited liability company with the attributes of a&#13;
commercial, self-supporting, revenue-earning firm, displaying operating and financial&#13;
efficiency. And on equity considerations, MUB seeks to equalize unit charges to ger and&#13;
apartment residents, at least for basic levels of water service.&#13;
Sector and USAG Action Plans&#13;
3.21  These objectives have been incorporated into Action Plans, one for USAG and&#13;
one for other sector issues and agencies. The Plans, adopted by the Municipality for&#13;
implementation over the next five years, and by USAG for its own jurisdiction. were&#13;
discussed and agreed at negotiations and incorporated in the Minutes of Negotiations.&#13;
3.22  The main elements of the Sector Improvement Action Plan are outlined in Annex&#13;
5a. Assurances were obtained that MUB would implement or cause USAG to implement&#13;
the Action Plans that could be amended by mutual agreement of the Government and IDA&#13;
during supervision missions.&#13;
3.23  The Institutional Development Plan for USAG's internal reorganization is shown&#13;
in Annex 5b. USAG was unable to corporatize under Mongolia's Partnership and&#13;
Company Law since it had not complied with two requirements of the Law:&#13;
establishment of a governing and an auditing board and submission of Articles of&#13;
Association consistent with principles of the Law. USAG has now taken action in these&#13;
areas, and is expected to have full legal status as a company by July 1, 1997. USAG&#13;
would thereafter gain autonomy in most aspects of its operations, with the exception of&#13;
tariff setting, which would remain under municipal control. As a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness, USAG will be established under Mongolia's 1995 Partnership and&#13;
Company Law, on the basis of a charter acceptable to the Association.  During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that MUB would cause USAG to implement an&#13;
Institutional Development Plan and submit revisions to the Plan to the Association for its&#13;
prior approval, as the need arises during project implementation.&#13;
3.24  During the project period, USAG would be restructured to enhance efficiency and&#13;
cater for its enlarged duties as a result of project activities. Restructuring would be&#13;
carried out gradually, in three phases. The first phase would separate USAG's water&#13;
supply and wastewater activities, integrate TANK staff into appropriate USAG&#13;
departments and have USAG assume TANK's responsibility for collecting water charges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
for ger area services. During the second phase, USAG would establish new departments&#13;
to handle the new services it would provide, e.g., metering, and would strengthen&#13;
departnents with expanded responsibilities, such as the Customer Services Department,&#13;
to be responsible for meter reading, billing and collection, and the Water Supply&#13;
Maintenance Department, to deal with the ger area water pipelines and to undertake an&#13;
expanded maintenance program for the existing network. The final phase of USAG's&#13;
action plan, at project completion and thereafter, would cater for further emerging needs,&#13;
e.g., assuming responsibility for investment planning and execution should these&#13;
functions be delegated to USAG by the municipality. Technical assistance and training&#13;
to facilitate USAG's development would be provided under the proposed project.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   Project Formulation.  In mid-1994, the Government's concern about the&#13;
condition of Mongolia's cities, which had begun to show the effects of several years of&#13;
forced neglect, caused it to request the Association's assistance in carrying out an&#13;
informal review of urban services in Mongolia's main cities. In particular, urban issues&#13;
were assessed from the perspective of two government goals: poverty alleviation and&#13;
devolution of functions and responsibilities to local governments.&#13;
4.2   The subsequent discussion of suggestions and proposals arising from the review&#13;
clarified priorities and prompted the Government to seek further Association help in&#13;
resolving two urgent issues facing Ulaanbaatar-the deterioration of its water supply and&#13;
distribution system and the dearth of public services in ger areas. A Phase I feasibility&#13;
study was subsequently prepared with financing provided by Japan's Policy and Human&#13;
Resources Development Fund (PHRD), followed by Phase II preparation of detailed&#13;
designs under Australian AusAID funding. Throughout each phase a Steering Committee&#13;
composed of representatives of various ministries assisted and guided the consultants and&#13;
organized the participation of local area leaders in the selection and design of&#13;
components. At a full review of the proposal in October 1996, the Municipality of&#13;
Ulaanbaatar endorsed the project scope and confirmed its contribution to the project's&#13;
financing plan.&#13;
4.3   Overall Project Objectives. The project's general objectives are to assist the&#13;
Government to: (a) address the inequity of services between ger and formal housing&#13;
areas, thereby improving the quality of life of the low-income population; (b) restore&#13;
levels and quality of water supply services in the Municipality and make that supply&#13;
accessible to the ger areas; and (c) develop more efficient and autonomous, performance-&#13;
oriented institutions, with a view to eventual privatization. Project activities in UB are&#13;
intended to demonstrate to Mongolia's other large cities the modalities and benefits of&#13;
urban renewal in the expectation that they will replicate these initiatives themselves the&#13;
future.&#13;
4.4   Detailed Project Objectives. The project's specific objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   Improve the quality, quantity and reliability of water supply for about 70&#13;
percent of the population in predominantly low-income ger areas, where&#13;
about half of UB's population resides;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(b)   Substantially lower the unit cost of water supply to ger areas by replacing&#13;
tankered with piped water and thereby bring the unit price for water&#13;
charged to the ger in line with that paid by apartment dwellers;&#13;
(c)   Improve ger area infrastructure, including roads, bridges, footpaths and&#13;
storm drainage, and enhance ger access to water supply and sanitation;&#13;
(d)   Arrest the deterioration in, and improve the reliability and quality of, the&#13;
city water distribution system while adapting it for distribution of piped&#13;
water to ger areas;&#13;
(e)   Reduce water wastage, the production of nonrevenue-producing water, and&#13;
water production costs;&#13;
(f)   Replace the current norm-based water and sanitation billing system to one&#13;
that is quantity-based; and&#13;
(g)   Develop USAG's capabilities for financial and operational management&#13;
and convert it into a self-financing commercially-oriented public utility.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPACT INDICATORS&#13;
4.5   Project implementation progress and development impact would be monitored by&#13;
a set of key indicators showing the delivery of inputs and realization of expected outputs.&#13;
The following indicators, shown in detail in Annex 3, would complement operational and&#13;
financial performance targets in the project's implementation, procurement and&#13;
disbursement schedules and project conditionality.&#13;
(a)   Poverty Alleviation&#13;
* Number and percentage of water kiosks served by a piped supply&#13;
versus targets&#13;
*  Ratio of the unit price of water to ger areas and to apartments to&#13;
become one by end of project period&#13;
*  Number of ger plots with access to footpathlroad within 50 meters&#13;
*  Per capita ger consumption of water&#13;
*  Growth of Ger Infrastructure Account&#13;
(b)   Efficiency Enhancement&#13;
* Decline in per capita water consumption in apartment buildings&#13;
* Amount of water delivered by truck&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
* Ratio of population served by USAG water supply to total number of&#13;
USAG staff&#13;
(c)   Capacity Building&#13;
* Water meters installed under the project&#13;
* Actual vs. planned budget expenditures for system maintenance&#13;
* Ratio of USAG's operating revenue to expenditures&#13;
(d)   Implementation Progress&#13;
* Actual disbursement compared to targets&#13;
* Planned vs. actual bid documents prepared by each December and&#13;
awarded by next April, to meet construction season requirements.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.6   The proposed project would include a physical investment program and an&#13;
institutional development component as outlined below and described in detail in Anne&#13;
2.&#13;
(a)   Physical Investments:&#13;
(i)   Strengthening  the  water supply  distribution  network  by&#13;
constructing about 32 km of transmission mains (300/500 mm&#13;
diameter) for the existing system and extending the system by&#13;
about 12 km with connection mains serving four ger areas;&#13;
(ii)    Constructing four concrete reservoirs to store water intended for&#13;
ger areas at Hailast, Baiyankoshuu, Yarmag and Shar Khad;&#13;
(iii)   Supplying and laying about 98 km of specially insulated PVC&#13;
pipelines to service most public water kiosks in about 12 ger areas;&#13;
(iv)   Implementing a water leakage and wastage reduction program&#13;
through: (a) the supply and installation of about 22,000 building&#13;
water meters to monitor and record building core consumption of&#13;
hot and cold water; and (b) repair of building and apartment&#13;
plumbing fixtures;&#13;
(v)    Supplying equipment and tools for maintenance and meter repair&#13;
workshops;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(vi)   Providing sewer observation and cleaning equipment to assess,&#13;
clear blockages to, and clean sewers, that have been damaged&#13;
during flooding and freezing periods; and&#13;
(vii)    Undertaking a Ger Area Infrastructure Upgrading Program in five&#13;
ger areas, entailing construction of limited roadwork, cutoff drains,&#13;
footpaths, additional water kiosks, repair of existing kiosks and&#13;
community bathrooms and laundries, and provision of garbage&#13;
bins.&#13;
(b)   Institutional Component:&#13;
(i)    Technical assistance in project management during the first two&#13;
years of project implementation; and in community awareness and&#13;
education of ger area residents;&#13;
(ii)   Institutional strengthening of USAG, the UB water utility, through&#13;
technical assistance and training in financial management,&#13;
technical areas, and development of maintenance programs for&#13;
water and wastewater systems;&#13;
(iii)    Studies reviewing the long-term development and planning of ger&#13;
areas in Ulaanbaatar, and definition of appropriate levels of public&#13;
services; and&#13;
(iv)    Development of, and training in, a computerized USAG billing and&#13;
collection system for metered supplies.&#13;
Water Supply Investments&#13;
4.7   The proposed water supply investments would address three aspects of USAG's&#13;
operations by: (a) improving and removing bottlenecks in the primary distribution&#13;
network; (b) constructing additional distribution facilities to improve service in ger areas&#13;
and to reduce the access cost to users; and (c) implementation of a water wastage&#13;
reduction plan in apartment areas, aimed at bringing overall consumption figures in line&#13;
with more typical levels through control by metering and replacement of leaking&#13;
plumbing fixtures.&#13;
4.8   Distribution Network. To improve service to the city's higher-demand areas,&#13;
now receiving inadequate and or intermittent flows and pressure, the proposed project&#13;
would make the now underutilized reservoir system fully operational to raise pressure&#13;
head, and the primary transmission main system around Ulaanbaatar would be reinforced&#13;
to accommodate larger flows at higher pressures. These improvements would raise&#13;
service quality without additional, and expensive, pumping. The project would complete&#13;
the southern section of the main distribution loop around the city area to help maintain&#13;
the water pressure and push flows toward the underserved western part of the city (Map&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
IBRD 28690). This would mainly entail: (a) supplying and laying pipelines for the&#13;
southern transmission main (3 km of 300 mm dia.); (b) constructing links between four&#13;
existing reservoirs (18 km of 500/400/300 mm dia.) and the southern links for the city&#13;
network main (11 km of 400 mm dia.); (c) rehabilitating and commissioning the&#13;
Northeast and "X" reservoirs, coupled with installation of a telemetry system to optimize&#13;
reservoir use; (d) repair and replacement of existing valves and installation of regulating&#13;
valves to increase pressures on secondary networks presently ill-served; and (e) provision&#13;
of equipment and spares for a workshop and laboratory.&#13;
4.9   Provision of Piped Water Supply to Ger Areas. Construction of additional&#13;
distribution facilities to improve the ger areas and reduce the cost of water to local&#13;
inhabitants would require development of reservoirs and networks to serve 12 priority ger&#13;
areas in the northeast, northwest and southwest fringes of the city's formally built-up&#13;
areas. About 70 percent of the population in the 12 areas (169,000 people) would be&#13;
supplied with piped water. These areas are projected to have a total population of&#13;
210,000 people by 2010. Six of the 12 areas were considered unsuitable for project&#13;
investment due to permafrost encroachment. The project would provide: (a) installation&#13;
of about 93 km of specially insulated pipes as the primary water supply distribution&#13;
network in ger areas, with risers to the public water kiosks serving the population;&#13;
(b) supply and laying of two transmission pipelines (9.4 km of 300/500 mm dia. and&#13;
2.7 km of 500 mm dia.) linking the ger distribution system to the existing city network;&#13;
(c) construction of four semiburied reservoirs at Hailast, Yarmag, Baiyankoshuu and Shar&#13;
Had, totaling 2,500 m3 capacity; (d) drilling of three boreholes at Yarmag Shar Khad and&#13;
Baiyankoshuu for the supply of areas that are better economically served through&#13;
independent groundwater supply; and (e) construction of 25 new water kiosks and&#13;
rehabilitation of 1 10 old ones serving the 12 ger areas.&#13;
4.10 Water Wastage Reduction Program. In support of the program, the project&#13;
would provide: (a) supply and installation of about 22,000 cold and hot water meters for&#13;
apartment building cores; (b) supply of fixtures and piping for apartments and building&#13;
interiors; and (c) provision of meter testing and repair facilities. Since water delivery to&#13;
apartment buildings has a complicated configuration owing to the involvement of CTPs,&#13;
metering of individual apartments would be costly and at this stage is considered&#13;
unnecessary. The project would therefore install meters at the entry of each apartment&#13;
block to measure amounts of water used by a group of tenants. The block metering&#13;
would thus provide an incentive for all tenants to both reduce water usage and proceed&#13;
with repair of broken plumbing fixtures. The water meters would be supplied and owned&#13;
by USAG, but installed by the kantors. Equipment needed to repair plumbing fixtures&#13;
would be provided to tenants as an additional cost or a loan, at a discounted rate. Kantor&#13;
staff would carry out the repairs. Details of the water metering program is described in&#13;
Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Emergency Sewerage System Repairs&#13;
4.11   The project includes a minimal amount of financing for purchase of equipment&#13;
needed to investigate and assess the condition of sewers, to clear blockages and to clean&#13;
sewers, such as high-pressure jetting and descaling machines. Repairs of servers and&#13;
manholes damaged by flood events and street traffic would be undertaken under the&#13;
maintenance program.&#13;
Ger Area Infrastructure Upgrading Program&#13;
4.12  Investments. Infrastructure improvements would be piloted in five priority ger&#13;
areas, with the expectation that similar works would subsequently be carried out in the&#13;
other ger areas (see Map IBRD 28690). In response to priorities expressed by ger&#13;
residents and with a view to affordability, the project would provide: (a) construction of&#13;
28.1 km of 1.2 m wide footpaths, 10.8 km of paved or gravel roads and three footbridges&#13;
and one road bridge giving residents better access from their plots to public facilities&#13;
(water kiosks, bus stops, schools); (b) construction of about 2.6 km of concrete-sided and&#13;
bottom drains and 2.2 km of levees, to ensure protection of ger from storms;&#13;
(c) manufacture and installation of about 650 three-cubic meter capacity refuse bins for&#13;
collection of solid wastes from ger and supply of several tip trucks and compactor trucks&#13;
for subsequent evacuation of refuse; and (d) construction of five laundries and bathhouses&#13;
in each of the five targeted areas. The detailed design and implementation in each ger&#13;
area would be developed with the active participation of the residents, to establish their&#13;
sense of ownership of the improvements and their commitment to future maintenance and&#13;
cost recovery. Details of the program are discussed in Annex 15.&#13;
4.13  The project infrastructure improvements will be made in five ger areas-Gandan,&#13;
Hailast, Dambadarjaa, Chingeltei and Denjin-which have been identified as having the&#13;
highest priority among the 12 ger areas found suitable for improvement. To establish&#13;
priorities for project improvements, the ger areas were ranked according to the following&#13;
criteria:&#13;
. health conditions and access to health services (e.g., socioeconomic&#13;
conditions)&#13;
*  population and population density&#13;
*  availability of services&#13;
*  logistical conditions for services' (e.g., ground conditions, permafrost, slope,&#13;
erosion and access, building relocation or property acquisition requirements,&#13;
which were given 50 percent weight in the analysis)&#13;
*  town planning and future city development requirements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
community willingness to participate in identification of priority investments&#13;
and to pay ger improvement charges for them.&#13;
4.14  About 75,000 people or 16,800 households reside in the five ger areas targeted for&#13;
infrastructure upgrading under the project. These areas would also benefit from the&#13;
project's provision of a piped water supply to the 12 priority ger areas. Due to resource&#13;
constraints, only about 45 percent of the population in the 12 ger areas suitable for&#13;
improvement could be included in the infrastructure upgrading program; and only a&#13;
minimum of essential improvements can be made in these areas. A substantial amount of&#13;
improvement work remains to be done in the future when more resources can be made&#13;
available. Agreements were obtained at negotiations that MUB would carry out a Ger&#13;
Infrastructure Improvement Program acceptable to the Association and would submit&#13;
any revision to such a program to the Association for its prior approval.&#13;
4.15  Planning Study. As an initial step in the process of improving the city's land use&#13;
management and integrating ger areas into the overall urban development plan, a study&#13;
would be carried out for the medium-term development and planning of ger areas in UB,&#13;
including definition of appropriate levels of public services. The study would also&#13;
consider the implications for ger planning of the city's recent land tenure proposals,&#13;
which would seem to grant ger residents user rights over their plots for a specific, fixed&#13;
period, which remains to be determined. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
MUB would carry out a study regarding medium-term development and planning of ger&#13;
areas, including appropriate levels of public investment, in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA, by December 31, 1998 and take the recommendations&#13;
arisingfrom the study into account in its urban development planning.&#13;
4.16  Infrastructure Changes. About 50 percent of the proposed ger investments-&#13;
including small roads and culverts, footpaths, grading, and solid waste bins-would be&#13;
subject to an on-site infrastructure charge, to permit cost recovery and sustainability of&#13;
the improvement program. The charge, to be about $75 equivalent per plot, would be&#13;
partly paid over time by the beneficiaries. An affordable charge of Tug 500/plot/month&#13;
($0.68/month), equivalent to about 1 percent of average 1996 ger household income,&#13;
would pay off major ger on-site costs in eight years (Annex 15). The charges would be&#13;
deposited in a separate account for ger improvement, which would be maintained by&#13;
MUB and collected by the khoroos.  The fee would have several benefits by:&#13;
(a) allowing the repayments to be used for further improvements to or maintenance in ger&#13;
area and to strengthen local community organizations; (b) financing MUB's&#13;
improvements in new ger areas accounting; (c) encouraging the residents' commitment to&#13;
the project improvements through an affordable charge; and (d) attracting additional&#13;
funding from external agencies. Subsequent area improvements would be prioritized and&#13;
undertaken according to the criteria mentioned in para. 4.13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
4.17  The project would finance technical assistance in project management during the&#13;
first two years of implementation; support to USAG; and community awareness and&#13;
education of ger area residents. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
MUB would recruit consultants for the project with terms and conditions satisfactory to&#13;
the Association.  Recruitment of consultants for project management would be a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.18  While the Mongolian construction industry has a reasonable experience in&#13;
constructing physical works, the Municipal Construction Planning Department has very&#13;
limited experience in managing Bank Group projects. Technical assistance would&#13;
therefore be provided under the project to assist local staff to gain skills and experience&#13;
with project management issues, particularly procurement, disbursement and monitoring.&#13;
Specialists to be recruited would include a project management advisor, a cold-climate&#13;
construction advisor, a water supply construction advisor, and a water supply&#13;
communications/control system advisor. The consultant team would work with an MUB&#13;
counterpart team over the course of their contract. Terms of reference for these and other&#13;
consultants to be engaged for the project are given in Annex 6.&#13;
4.19  During the project period, USAG would reorganize itself and carry out a program&#13;
of institutional strengthening to allow it to function as a commercially-oriented water&#13;
supply and sewerage utility, with responsibilities for investment planning and execution,&#13;
and financial control. A USAG Institutional Development Action Plan, developed by&#13;
USAG and its consultants, is shown in Annex 5. The proposed project would finance&#13;
technical assistance and training to help USAG implement the Plan, with expertise to be&#13;
provided in financial management, technical areas, and development of maintenance&#13;
programs for water and wastewater systems.  Development of and training in a&#13;
computerized USAG billing and collection system for metered supplies would also be&#13;
financed.&#13;
4.20  The Ger Area Infrastructure Improvement Program is intended to demonstrate the&#13;
benefits of the proposed investments to other ger areas. Its success will depend on&#13;
community commitment to and participation in the works to be carried out. To sustain&#13;
the local participation shown during project preparation, it is proposed to engage a local&#13;
nongovernmental organization, Women for Social Progress, to stimulate community&#13;
awareness of the project's aims, mobilize and organize community involvement in&#13;
carrying out construction activities, and organize community awareness of public health&#13;
and project issues.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
4.21  The Project Preparation Office and key project staff are receiving assistance from&#13;
consultants involved in the Phase II preparation; study and designs have been completed&#13;
for all physical works to be carried out during the first year of project implementation.&#13;
To avoid losing one construction season (May-November 1997), bid documentation is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
now finalized to ensure readiness of bidding documents by June 1997. Also, an extensive&#13;
canvassing to determine precise requirements for the water meter installation and fixture&#13;
repair programs is under way with the kantors' input, and should yield information for&#13;
defining equipment and work requirements. A first canvassing of interested contractors&#13;
and suppliers has taken place through national public notification as well as circulation of&#13;
the notice for the first year's works to commercial sections of all represented embassies in&#13;
Ulaanbaatar of IDA member countries. The Municipality is eager to proceed with early&#13;
implementation of physical works and has earmarked Tug 100 million ($140,000) to start&#13;
contracts with advance payment from the Municipality and subsequent reimbursement&#13;
from the Credit and the Grant.&#13;
E. COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
4.22  The estimated cost of the proposed project is $23.6 million, including import&#13;
duties and sales taxes, and physical and price contingencies. All cost and financing&#13;
estimates, including local costs, have been calculated in US dollars, due to high and&#13;
unpredictable domestic inflation. Cost estimates are based on engineering designs and on&#13;
unit prices prevailing in 1997. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent for all&#13;
goods and civil works, and 5 percent for technical assistance. Price escalation is based on&#13;
a projected international inflation rate of 2.5 percent per year for 1997 and thereafter.&#13;
Cost estimates are summarized in Table 4.1 below, and detailed costs are provided in&#13;

Project Financing&#13;
4.23  The financing plan is shown in Table 4.2. Total financing required is $23.6&#13;
million of which, $14.8 million, or 67 percent, constitutes the direct foreign exchange&#13;
component. The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 12.3 million ($16.7 million equivalent)&#13;
represents 100 percent of the project's foreign exchange component and 71 percent of the&#13;
total project cost. The IDA credit would finance the project's water supply and sewerage&#13;
components and related technical assistance. An Australian Government AusAID grant&#13;
of $4.9 million equivalent would finance 100 percent of the ger area infrastructure&#13;
upgrading works and related technical assistance. MUB would finance $2.0 million&#13;
equivalent, or 8 percent of total costs. The AusAID grant would be managed by IDA&#13;
under the Global Trust Fund Agreement between the Bank Group and the Government of&#13;
Australia.&#13;

4.24 IDA funds would be made available to the Government of Mongolia at standard&#13;
IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity and a 10-year grace period. The credit proceeds&#13;
would be onlent by the Government to MUB under a subsidiary loan agreement between&#13;
the Government and MUB. A further onlending agreement would be made between&#13;
MUB and USAG. AusAID funds would be made available to the Government, which&#13;
would pass on the funds to MUB under a Subsidiary Grant Agreement. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations from the Borrower that: (a) it would onlend the IDA credit to&#13;
MUB under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement at an annual interest rate of I percent and a&#13;
repayment period of 40 years including 10 years of grace, (b) MUB would onlend&#13;
proceeds of the IDA Credit to USAG under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement at an annual&#13;
interest rate of 5 percent and a repayment period of 20 years including 5 years of grace,&#13;
with MUB bearing the exchange risk. Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements&#13;
would be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.25 A Project Agreement would be executed between IDA and MUB.&#13;

F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.26  Project procurement would be in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995" and revised in January&#13;
and August 1996.   All international competitive bidding (ICB) documents would&#13;
conform to the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. Under previous IDA operations in&#13;
Mongolia, procurement has been centralized within a unit in the Ministry of Trade and&#13;
Industry now transferred to MID, where experience and expertise have been developed to&#13;
assist project entities in carrying out procurement in conformity with IDA guidelines.&#13;
Procurement under the proposed project would benefit from MID's assistance, as well as&#13;
consultant assistance to be provided under the project to MUB and USAG. In the&#13;
absence of specific local bidding contracts, the consultants who assisted the Borrower in&#13;
preparing the project have helped to prepare satisfactory model civil works documents for&#13;
small works in the Mongolian language on the basis of the Bank Sample Bid Documents.&#13;
Annex 8 lists the Schedule of Procurement Packages and the method of procurement, and&#13;
Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement categories and the expected procurement methods.&#13;

4.27  Civil works contracts totaling about $11.4 million would be packaged so that&#13;
each contract could be implemented over a period of seven months, April to October,&#13;
when construction is possible in Mongolia. Contracts above $0.5 million each would be&#13;
procured under ICB. About five ICB contracts, each averaging $0.7 million and totaling&#13;
some $3.3 million, are envisioned. Qualified domestic contractors would receive a 7.5&#13;
percent preference in bid evaluation on these contracts. Contracts above $0.2 million&#13;
each, and expected to total $6.6 million for both the water supply and ger upgrading&#13;
components, would be awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Association, with bidding also open to foreign contractors from&#13;
neighboring countries who are likely to tender for these smaller contracts. Nearby&#13;
foreign contractors would be allowed to participate in NCB since Mongolia currently has&#13;
only about 12 competent local civil works contractors, some of whom occasionally&#13;
associate with foreign contractors. Civil works contracts for installation of meters and&#13;
plumbing fixture repair amounting to $20,000 each and aggregating to $200,000 would&#13;
be carried out under force account or direct contracting with kantors' work forces.&#13;
Equipment and materials for the water supply and ger upgrading components would total&#13;
about $4.8 million. All contracts above $100,000 would be awarded after ICB. About&#13;
four ICB equipment packages, each costing an estimated $1 million, are expected.&#13;
Contracts averaging $100,000 each would be awarded following NCB, and are expected&#13;
to total $500,000. Contracts of less than $60,000 each for yearly supplies of various&#13;
minor equipment, which cannot be economically tendered under ICB/NCB packages,&#13;
would be bid through International Shopping in an aggregate amount not exceeding&#13;
$300,000. There are no manufacturers of relevant sector equipment in Mongolia, and&#13;
domestic preference would not be offered. There would be no prequalification of bidders&#13;
for goods or works contracts, but the annual updated procurement notice published in&#13;
local newspapers for informing contractors and commercial sections of embassies of each&#13;
year's bidding packages will request interested contractors to state their qualifications and&#13;
experience for each type of contract. Postqualification would be carried out for each&#13;
contract during bid evaluation.&#13;
4.28 IDA-financed training and technical assistance services ($1.7 million) would be&#13;
procured in accordance with IDA Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. The most appropriate selection&#13;
method would be through quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS), which combines the&#13;
quality of the proposal with the cost of the services. However, specific assignments&#13;
(audit, maintenance system development, PMU strengthening) totaling $450,000 would&#13;
be procured through quality-based selection (QBS), least cost selection, single source&#13;
selection, and individual consultants.&#13;
4.29  All contracts above $100,000 for equipment and civil works would be subject to&#13;
prior review. This would cover more than 80 percent of the total value of Association-&#13;
financed contracts. All consulting assignments above $50,000 for firms and above&#13;
$20,000 for individuals would also be subject to prior review. In addition, post review&#13;
would be carried out of one contract in five until the mid-term review in December 1999&#13;
and thereafter one contract in ten if earlier reviews have justified such reductions. All&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
terms of reference for single-source selections would also be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review.&#13;
4.30  Early Procurement. The Municipality is about to construct two water supply&#13;
transmission mains, expected to cost about $1.2 million equivalent, to improve water&#13;
distribution to the city and, more important, to ger areas. While the method of procuring&#13;
these works does not fully accord with Bank Group requirements, since procurement was&#13;
limited to municipally selected companies, the works are nevertheless considered as part&#13;
of the project and their funding by the municipality as part of the Government's&#13;
contribution to project financing.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.31  The proposed IDA Credit of $16.7 million equivalent would be disbursed over a&#13;
period of about five years. Disbursements would be as indicated below:&#13;

4.32  To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$0.5 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be&#13;
established. It would be replenished quarterly or whenever the Special Account is drawn&#13;
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements for training&#13;
and for all contracts not exceeding $20,000 would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), certified by the Director of UB's Strategic Planning Department.&#13;
Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by the Project Management Unit and&#13;
made available for inspection by IDA supervision missions. All other disbursements&#13;
would be made against fully documented expenditures. A Schedule of Disbursements is&#13;
given in Annex 9. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001, and&#13;
the credit closing date would be June 30, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
H. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.33  The Municipality of Ulaanbaatar would be responsible for implementing the&#13;
project. While the Municipality has implemented some relatively large civil works&#13;
during the past few years, the proposed project, with its annual work program equivalent&#13;
to the city's total annual capital expenditure, would require provision of additional&#13;
management support.  This would be financed under the project.  Additional&#13;
strengthening in municipal financial management would be provided by bilateral&#13;
assistance now being identified.&#13;
4.34 To oversee day-to-day aspects of implementation, a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) would be established in the Department of Strategic Planning under the Mayor's&#13;
Office. The PMU would comprise five professional staff and appropriate support&#13;
personnel. Consultants in project management to be provided under the project would&#13;
assist the Unit during the first 24 months of implementation, and technical expertise in&#13;
the water supply sector would be provided during the project's first two years. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, MUB will establish the PMU and thereafter maintain it&#13;
throughout project implementation, with budget, functions and responsibilities&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, and with competent staff in adequate numbers.&#13;
4.35  Implementation of the Ger Area Infrastructure Improvement Program would be&#13;
carried out by MUB through its local officials in the neighborhood khoroos. The&#13;
planning and design of improvements beyond Year 1 proposals would be the&#13;
responsibility of MUB's Architecture and Building Office, which would coordinate with&#13;
khoroos for the purpose of community involvement (para. 4.42). The meter installation&#13;
and fixture repair programs would be carried out by the kantors' own labor force. Minor&#13;
technical assistance would be provided under the meter supply contract to ensure&#13;
appropriate installation of meters, and preparation of a satisfactory computerized billing&#13;
system, enabling USAG and kantors to start effective monitoring of customer&#13;
consumption upon installation of the meters.&#13;
4.36  A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) prepared by MUB has been prepared and is&#13;
available in the project file (Annexi1). An Implementation Schedule is providing the&#13;
detailed procurement plan for the first two project years is included in Annex 1O. As part&#13;
of the sector improvement action plan, MUB and USAG agreed during negotiations to&#13;
have PMU prepare and submit by each October 15 a procurement plan for the next year.&#13;
I. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.37  No land acquisition is required for the project. MUB already owns land for the&#13;
project reservoirs, and the two transmission mains would be laid in existing streets. The&#13;
pipelines serving the ger areas and the infrastructure improvements to those areas would&#13;
similarly entail no disruption to the local inhabitants since the ger areas are very well laid&#13;
out, with major access ways that will easily accommodate the water pipes, water kiosks,&#13;
and other small infrastructure to be provided under the project. No resettlement or&#13;
disruption to current economic activities is therefore expected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.38  Environmental Assessment. For purposes of Environmental Assessment (EA),&#13;
the proposed project is designated as Category B.  With support from  technical&#13;
assistance, MID and the Ministry of Nature and Environment prepared an EA for the&#13;
project, which focused on the construction of a small concrete reservoir on a hilltop to&#13;
serve the local ger population. The EA concludes that only minor controls are required,&#13;
particularly during the construction stage, to ensure that the proposed reservoir is&#13;
environmentally sound. The site geology has been investigated by borehole drilling&#13;
across the site, the existing environment is already disturbed in terms of vehicles and foot&#13;
traffic, and there will be insignificant impact on fauna and flora. The assessment includes&#13;
an Environmental Management Plan covering all phases of the development from&#13;
preconstruction to operation and maintenance includes mitigation measures for the few&#13;
potential impacts identified-noise and dust during construction as well as soil erosion&#13;
and silt runoff.   During negotiations, assurances were be obtained that the&#13;
Environmental Management Plan would be carried out in a manner satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
4.39  More positively, project activities to reduce water wastage, e.g., construction of a&#13;
reservoir and provision of water meters, will maximize the availability of water and allow&#13;
service to the ger areas and other additional users within this relatively water-short area.&#13;
They will also obviate the need to increase water production in the next five years while&#13;
at the same time making more water available to the ger population. The increase of&#13;
water consumption of ger residents from 7.5-10 lcd now to 20 lcd by 2010 is unlikely to&#13;
cause any waterlogging situation within or around ger plots.  The project would&#13;
significantly improve the environment in ger areas by reducing solid waste via its&#13;
improved collection and disposal and by reducing flooding and erosion through improved&#13;
stormwater drainage. The reduction of wastewater due to the water wastage reduction&#13;
program will also help improve the water quality downstream, and thus reduce demands&#13;
on the already very limited operational capacity of UB's wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
4.40  Cold Climate Considerations.  The project design takes into consideration&#13;
Ulaanbaatar's severe winter climate, which is comparable to that of Anchorage, Alaska.&#13;
The main potential problem is freezing of water in pipework systems, particularly in ger&#13;
areas where low flows can be expected with the low water demand. Frost penetration&#13;
could exceed 5.5 meters in the city and 6 to 8 meters in northern exposed ger areas.&#13;
However, a cost comparison indicates that it is more economical to insulate pipes and&#13;
prevent stagnation than to lay small pipes below the frost penetration line. Specific&#13;
design features were therefore adopted for the pipe insulation, pipe material, burial depth&#13;
and coverage of pipelines and rises serving kiosks, flow patterns in distribution pipes and&#13;
reservoirs, looped connections to water-delivering kiosks, minimization of dead-end&#13;
pipes, introduction of special drainage, and control and maintenance features in case of&#13;
system failures and need of pipe repairs. Specific investments such as a recirculating ger&#13;
looped network and boiler r-calculation near and around reservoirs have been included in&#13;
the project. These measures are based on similar systems in operations in Northern&#13;
Canada and Alaska and have been found acceptable by a cold climate construction expert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
K. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION&#13;
4.41   Throughout project preparation process, representatives of the 12 ger communities&#13;
included in the project have been consulted on the types of infrastructure upgrading&#13;
desired by the local communities and on the Municipality's proposals for meeting these&#13;
needs. The community's views were also solicited on a range of issues including site&#13;
conditions, drainage problems, pipeline routes and solid waste issues. To provide&#13;
information for selecting the project gers, a survey was initiated with the assistance of&#13;
community leaders on population incomes and expenditures as well as population&#13;
movement in and out of the 12 proposed project areas.&#13;
4.42  During implementation, the views of ger area representatives will continue to be&#13;
canvassed by the Municipality's local subadministrative agencies (khoroos) who will&#13;
participate in community development, and in the collection of ger infrastructure fund&#13;
charges. lIt is anticipated that the local community associations formed for project&#13;
preparation will be strengthened with the assistance of newly created nongovernmental&#13;
organizations, such as Women for Social Progress, which have taken an interest in ger&#13;
area activities and wish to facilitate community development and involvement in all&#13;
aspects of ger area upgrading. Measures proposed for maximum community participation&#13;
would be to:&#13;
(a)   identify community interest groups in ger areas such as women,&#13;
pensioners, single parents and youth, for the formation of community&#13;
councils bringing together district representatives;&#13;
(b)   organize meetings of community councils for general acceptance of water&#13;
vending kiosk locations, use of solid waste bins and duties of householders&#13;
for an efficient solid waste collection, initiation of community&#13;
management of facilities such as bathrooms and laundries;&#13;
(c)   introduce concepts such as small business cooperatives for such activities&#13;
as vegetable growing and ash waste recycling and public laundries; and&#13;
(d)   foster the idea that the infrastructure charge would be used for additional&#13;
infrastructure improvements and for related maintenance.&#13;
4.43  In addition, IDA  supervision  missions during  the first two  years of&#13;
implementation will include a sociologist to monitor local reactions to the project and&#13;
advise MUB on appropriate participatory approaches to program implementation.&#13;
L. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT&#13;
4.44  To facilitate various market-oriented reforms, the Government required all public&#13;
enterprises, starting in 1996, to adopt a new enterprise accounting system, which is&#13;
consistent with internationally accepted accounting standards (IAAS). With financial&#13;
technical assistance under the project, USAG will convert to the new accounting system&#13;
and procedures to be consistent with IAAS by the end of 1998. The new accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
system to be introduced will also set up a rigorous cost accounting system to enable&#13;
separate accounting of USAG's water supply and sewerage operations. This will increase&#13;
the transparency of costs and operations and will facilitate monitoring USAG's financial&#13;
performance and the adequacy of tariffs. Assurances were obtained during negotiations&#13;
that USAG will separate its water accounts from its sewerage accounts by December 31,&#13;
1998.&#13;
4.45  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) the project accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account and statements of expenditure, as well as USAG 'sfinancial&#13;
statements would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA with a separate&#13;
opinion on SOEs; and (b) the audit reports would be sent to IDA for review within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year. Given the project's TA to upgrade USAG's&#13;
accounting procedures and system and to implement an adequate internal control system&#13;
in the PMU, as well as the recent government efforts to improve its accounting and&#13;
auditing standards with ADB's support. The project will use the local auditing services&#13;
to the extent possible. This arrangement will not only reduce the cost of auditing, but&#13;
will help ensure that constant principles are applied to the IDA projects. As local&#13;
capacity and practices develop, the foreign accounting firm will be replaced by a local&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Association.&#13;
M. MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.46  The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10, and project&#13;
performance and impact monitoring indicators are given in Annex 3. The format and&#13;
content of project progress reports and project impact monitoring indicators and&#13;
methodology would be discussed and confirmed during negotiations.   During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that MUB would prepare and furnish to IDA&#13;
biannual project implementation progress reports and annual financial reports including&#13;
the Special Account and statements of expenditures.&#13;
4.47  The Association's supervision of the project would focus on physical and&#13;
institutional progress, particularly enterprise restructuring and strengthening, besides&#13;
monitoring progress in achieving project objectives. Project supervision would require&#13;
about 75 staff-weeks over the life of the project, including 20 staff-weeks at headquarters&#13;
to review progress reports, procurement actions and reports and 40 staff-weeks in the&#13;
field. More intensive supervision would be required during the first three years of the&#13;
project when the technical assistance would be made operational and many procurement&#13;
contracts would be tendered, evaluated and awarded. Supervision would be provided by&#13;
environmental engineering and financial staff, as well as other specialists, e.g., a&#13;
sociologist, as needed.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a mid-&#13;
project review report would be submitted to IDA by October 30, 1999. The project&#13;
supervision plan is shown in Annex 11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
5. FINANCE&#13;
A. MUNICIPAL FINANCE&#13;
5.1   With more than 25 percent of Mongolia's total population, Ulaanbaatar had an&#13;
operating budget of Tug 23.9 billion in 1995, equivalent to 18 percent of the national&#13;
budget of Tug 131.3 billion. During the economic upheavals of the early 1990s, and&#13;
particularly in 1992, UB's budget shrank dramatically and, since then, has stabilized in&#13;
real terms. The budget is divided into the current budget for operating expenditures and&#13;
the capital budget for new investments. UB's operating budget has maintained a surplus&#13;
in the 1990s, except for a small deficit in 1995. The capital budget, however, is managed&#13;
separately from the operating budget and is financed by a combination of subsidies from&#13;
the central budget, municipal budget reserves, and off-budget sources such as a fixed&#13;
asset sales fund. UB has no outstanding debts and its nominal revenues have grown in&#13;
line with inflation since 1992. The expected introduction of a property tax on the recently&#13;
privatized apartments and UB's policy of increasing tariffs for urban services to recover&#13;
operating costs will help further consolidate its finances. A detailed description of the&#13;
municipality's financial situation and its projection are in Annex 12.&#13;
5.2   The proposed IDA Credit would be directly onlent from the Central Government&#13;
to USAG. UB, however, made a commitment to provide $1.26 million equivalent in&#13;
project counterpart funding, apart from the $0.8 million needed for taxes, and the already&#13;
earmarked Tug 100 million in the 1997 budget to carry out construction of two&#13;
connecting pipelines under the project. As the project's financial analysis shows that&#13;
USAG can generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service, the repayment of the&#13;
IDA Credit would not create an additional burden on municipal finance. Furthermore,&#13;
with the resumption of economic growth, the commencement of housing privatization&#13;
(which could provide a solid basis for charging adequate tariffs for various municipal&#13;
services) and the planned introduction of a variety of taxes and fees, the growth of&#13;
municipal revenues is likely to accelerate.  During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from UB that it will provide, directly or through USAG, the necessary&#13;
counterpart funds for execution of the project.&#13;
5.3   The AusAID  grant of $4.9 million equivalent will be passed on to the&#13;
Municipality. The investments supported by AusAID for the next five years amount to&#13;
50 percent of MUB's 1996 capital budget and will help relieve the burden on municipal&#13;
finance substantially.   Moreover, establishment of the Ger Area Infrastructure&#13;
Development Program, with its cost-recovery principle that encourages beneficiaries'&#13;
ownership of the facilities provided, and of separate account for the proceeds of the&#13;
charge, will help the municipality make sustainable infrastructure investments in the ger&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. USAG: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO DATE&#13;
5.4   Mongolia has experienced significant hyperinflation since its breakaway from the&#13;
FSU in 1991. The price index rose from 100 in 1990 to 5,729 in 1996, with an average&#13;
annual inflation rate of 115.6 percent, while its currency was devalued from Tug 40/$1 in&#13;
1992 to Tug 695/$1 at the end of 1996. Given the hyperinflation, relatively slow and&#13;
less-than-sufficient revaluation of assets, and changes in the geographical scope of its&#13;
operation, USAG's historical data have inherent distortions, particularly in the balance&#13;
sheet. This analysis therefore summarizes USAG's recent performance, but because past&#13;
data should be approached with some caution, the analysis focuses on the future cash&#13;
flow and income statement data adjusted in 1996 constant money terms, which will&#13;
measure USAG's future cash generating and revenue-earning capacity.&#13;
5.5   Shrinking Revenues and Operations. USAG's financial situation in recent&#13;
years appears to have been sound based on its profit and loss statement. It has operated&#13;
with a cash surplus and small profit since the 1990s, except in 1994, and carries no&#13;
outstanding long-term debt. When ongoing hyperinflation pushed it into a small loss&#13;
amounting to 3 percent of total revenue in 1994, it increased its tariffs to allow a small&#13;
profit in 1995. This performance, which results from the Government's policy to keep&#13;
USAG's financial status near a break-even level by adjusting tariffs rather than increasing&#13;
efficiency, disguises many serious problems faced by USAG.&#13;
5.6   USAG's revenue has been shrinking at 38 percent a year in real terms since 1991&#13;
and its cash operating costs are also shrinking at 15 percent a year. This reflects tariff&#13;
adjustments that were lower than required to compensate for hyperinflation.  The&#13;
cumulative tariff adjustments for industrial users since 1991 were 3,571 percent,&#13;
compared to 5,729 percent cumulative inflation for the same period. Faced with the&#13;
shrinking revenues, USAG has been scaling down expenditures by forgoing critical&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation investments, rather than improving its efficiency. The&#13;
lack of proper maintenance, if allowed to continue, will do irreparable damage to the&#13;
water supply infrastructure, which will incur unsustainably heavy costs in the near future.&#13;
5.7   USAG's current business practices also have a variety of inherent inefficiencies.&#13;
The most significant problem is its practice of charging apartment residents based on an&#13;
inadequate norm, which encourages high water wastage and inaction against leakage. In&#13;
addition, TANK operations and USAG's billing and collection system need urgent&#13;
improvement.&#13;
5.8   Billing and Collection. Billing and collection are currently carried out by the&#13;
kantors, which used to take a service fee from the collected revenues. Although&#13;
consumers diligently pay for water services, the kantors are usually delinquent in turning&#13;
over the revenues to USAG due to their own financial difficulties. This problem is&#13;
particularly acute in winter when the kantors face large heating and electricity bills. As a&#13;
result' USAG's accounts receivable are as high as 16 percent of sales in winter, dropping&#13;
to 2 or 3 percent in the summer. The size of the kantors' service fee has been determined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
annually by negotiations between USAG and the kantors without an accurate basis to&#13;
price the kantors' services. However, the recent service fee level of over 20 percent of&#13;
revenues collected seems very high and reduces USAG's potential revenue. It is&#13;
recommended that USAG improve the current billing and collection system in the near&#13;
future, in conjunction with the planned privatization of kantors.&#13;
5.9   TANK  Operations.  Due to unsustainably high operating costs, TANK&#13;
operations have been losing money despite its exorbitant tariff charged to ger residents&#13;
and free water supply from USAG. TANK's unit operating cost of water in 1996&#13;
constant terns is Tug 535/m3, compared with Tug 33/m3 in the central city area.&#13;
Analysis of TANK operations shows that replacing most of TANK-delivered water with a&#13;
piped supply to the kiosks, as would be done under the project, can significantly reduce&#13;
operating costs while more than doubling the water supplied to ger residents to 20 lcd.&#13;
As indicated in Chapter 3, to reduce USAG's operating costs, TANK operations and staff&#13;
would be phased down as piped water supply is introduced in the project ger areas.&#13;
C. USAG: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
5.10  Tariffs. Following a recently introduced 60 percent increase in electricity prices,&#13;
which account for over 70 percent of USAG's operating costs, USAG raised its water&#13;
tariffs by a weighted average of 83 percent, effective from October 1996. The current&#13;
tariff structure is shown in Table 5.1. USAG has also streamlined its relationship with&#13;
the kantors by charging them directly and setting a 20 percent cap on the additional&#13;
charge kantors can impose on apartment dwellers.&#13;

5.11  The introduction of metering under the proposed project will give USAG an&#13;
effective demand management tool to discourage water wastage. Following installation&#13;
of the project meters, USAG will introduce a "step tariff' by which it would charge a&#13;
much higher tariff for water use above a predetermined level (the "cutoff level"). The&#13;
cutoff level would be based on actual consumption rates after meter installation as well as&#13;
the desired, feasible consumption level. Under the project's sector improvement action&#13;
plan, USAG would prepare a program satisfactory to the Association for the introduction&#13;
of a step tariff; the program would be reviewed annually in consultation with the&#13;
Association during the last quarter of each fiscal year, starting in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5.12 Financial projections for USAG during 1997-2017 were undertaken based on&#13;
assumptions shown in Annex 13. Major assumptions include: the phase-out of the&#13;
TANK operation in ger areas, the phase-in of block metering, introduction of a special&#13;
maintenance fund, and annual tariff adjustments reflecting input cost increases. Detailed&#13;
financial statements are also given in Annex 13 and summarized in Table 5.2.&#13;
5.13  The projections indicate that USAG's current tariff, if maintained in real terms,&#13;
can generate sufficient operating income to cover all operating and maintenance costs&#13;
plus whichever is larger between depreciation and debt service during the project period.&#13;
This assumes an adequate pricing mechanism backed up by the installation of block&#13;
meters to reduce the uncharged volume of water. In a base case where average&#13;
consumption is assumed to fall from the present level of over 300 lcd to around 230 lcd,&#13;
the combination of expected cost savings from reduced water wastage and phase-out of&#13;
the expensive TANK truck supply could generate enough cash during the project period&#13;
to cover debt service on investments in the project's piped water supply to ger kiosks,&#13;
while equalizing the basic unit charge for water to ger with the unit charge to apartment&#13;
consumers.  These forecasts are based on conservative assumptions, and actual&#13;
consumption and future revenues of USAG may well be larger than the base case, barring&#13;
major changes in assumptions or consumer behavior. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that beginning in USAG 's fiscal year commencing January 1, 1998, USAG&#13;
will take necessary measures, including adjustment of tariffs, to ensure that its annual&#13;
operating income will cover operating costs and the amount by which debt service&#13;
requirements exceed the provision for depreciation. To meet these measures, assurances&#13;
were also obtained that beginning in October 1997 and biannually each April and&#13;
October thereafter USAG would prepare and submit to its Board and IDA, annual&#13;
financial forecasts for the current and following years and the recommended tariff rate&#13;
and structure and timing of implementation.&#13;
5.14  Performance Indicators. Based on these assumptions, the major financial and&#13;
operational performance indicators are summarized in Table 5.2.&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
6.1   The proposed project, with its focus on ger area upgrading, will help ease the&#13;
social burden of structural reform and the country's transition to a market economy by&#13;
improving urban services and hygiene in the ger areas. The project would provide piped&#13;
water to about 169,000 people or 70 percent of the 12 ger areas supplied. About 75,000&#13;
of those beneficiaries would also gain other basic infrastructure under the project. Project&#13;
support and service improvements to the existing system would benefit all those now&#13;
served with a steadier supply at higher pressure. As the first IDA-supported urban&#13;
development project in Mongolia, it also introduces market-oriented provision and&#13;
management of urban services by providing an adequate cost recovery mechanism&#13;
combined with financial incentives for water conservation and operational efficiency.&#13;
Furthermore, an institutional development and reform action plan will reshape UB's&#13;
water supply and sanitation utility to function in a market economy in a financially and&#13;
environmentally equitable and sustainable manner.&#13;
B. EcONOMIc ANALYSIS&#13;
6.2   The project comprises three major components: water supply for UB's ger areas,&#13;
water supply to the central city area, and ger area upgrading. As each component has a&#13;
different type of economic benefit, the analysis is carried out by component. Quantitative&#13;
cost-benefit analysis, possible only for the two water supply components, focuses on the&#13;
incremental costs and benefits between the "with project" and "without project" cases,&#13;
based on the financial analysis. When necessary and appropriate, appropriate proxies and&#13;
shadow prices are used to measure economic benefits and costs that differ from financial&#13;
benefits and costs. Details of the economic analysis are given in Annex 14.&#13;
Ger Area Water Supply&#13;
6.3   In the ger areas, the benefits and costs have been quantified to the extent possible.&#13;
The major benefit is increased consumption of water to a level of 20 lcd, considered the&#13;
minimum requirement for health and hygiene, at a much lower price than before. The&#13;
economic benefit to ger residents is measured using the 1995 price of water as a proxy for&#13;
consumers' willingness to pay. An additional benefit is derived from the savings in&#13;
capital investments and recurrent costs to maintain a larger fleet of trucks and tanks,&#13;
owing to the introduction of a piped water supply to cover 70 percent of the ger area&#13;
population. This benefit is compared to the initial capital investment to provide water&#13;
supply to kiosks under the project. The resulting economic internal rate of return (EIRR)&#13;
is 19 percent. It should also be noted that the project's major benefits will accrue to ger&#13;
residents whose average income is estimated to be 70 percent of apartment dwellers'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
incomes, and who include the urban poor. The additional consumption of potable water&#13;
will substantially enhance the level of health and hygiene in ger area, and easier access to&#13;
kiosks will also decrease work for ger area women and children who traditionally haul&#13;
water home. These qualitative benefits, albeit substantial, are not involved in the&#13;
quantitative analysis.&#13;
City Water Supply Improvements&#13;
6.4   In the central city water supply component, the benefits come from reduced&#13;
consumption of valuable resources rather than from incremental benefits or production.&#13;
In fact, the supply of water will decrease under the project. The "with project" case&#13;
assumes that, with the introduction of block metering and step tariffs, the wastage of&#13;
water will substantially decrease, requiring fewer resources to produce the water and&#13;
collect, treat and discharge wastewater. The benefits of treating less wastewater and&#13;
using fewer resources for water production are all captured as USAG handles both&#13;
operations. The resultant EIRR of 14.4 percent, however, understates the real benefits, as&#13;
the benefits of a more stable water supply with higher and more evenly distributed water&#13;
pressure backed by reserve capacity in reservoirs are difficult to quantify and are&#13;
therefore excluded from the analysis. Also omitted from the analysis is the unquantified&#13;
benefit of the enhanced efficiency and accountability derived from institutional&#13;
strengthening supported by project technical assistance.&#13;
6.5   The weighted average EIRR for the water supply component is estimated to be&#13;
15.9 percent, based on the above analysis. The real benefit of the proposed project would&#13;
be much larger, however, owing to its significant unquantified benefits. The very concept&#13;
of serving ger area residents equally with the apartment dwellers will also provide a basis&#13;
for similar future interventions for other types of municipal service.&#13;
Ger Area Infrastructure Improvements&#13;
6.6   Planned Ger improvement covers various subcomponents reflecting the priorities&#13;
of the Ger residents, generating various economic benefits. Most of these benefits,&#13;
though hard to quantify, are substantial and directly accrue to Ger residents. Provision of&#13;
total length of 10.8 km roads, a bridge, and 30.8 km all-weather footpaths with four&#13;
footbridges in areas with the most critical needs can help save substantial time for the&#13;
residents to haul coal and wood, other household goods as well as to fetch water. For&#13;
example, the maximum travel distance for 20 kg water fetching will be reduced from the&#13;
maximum of 700 m to 350 m, and the footpaths will help ease the labor of water fetching&#13;
usually carried out by women and children. The benefit from easier fuel hauling is no&#13;
less significant, considering the bulky nature of coal and wood and its position as the&#13;
second largest expenditure item in Ger area. The estimated time saved for water fetching&#13;
alone would amount to over 10 million hours/year for 86,000 people, similar saving is&#13;
expected coal, wood and other household supplies. Paved roads can also substantially&#13;
save the fuel cost and maintenance expenditure for delivery trucks and other vehicles, as&#13;
well as save the time for delivery. The economic rate of return for $1.4 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
investment for road construction is estimated to be over 40 percent. Construction and&#13;
operation of public bathhouses and laundries can improve the health of Ger residents.&#13;
Likewise, improvement in solid waste collection would improve the hygiene of Ger area&#13;
considerably. Also important are the benefits from the construction of the stormwater&#13;
drainage in flood-prone areas, which can help reduce the property damage as well as&#13;
avoid the loss of human lives. In addition to these direct benefits, overall infrastructure&#13;
improvements would motivate the voluntary investments for further improvements in&#13;
each individual plot by each household. Some of these benefits would be captured by the&#13;
increase in property prices, particularly in light of the forthcoming privatization of urban&#13;
land. To summarize, there would be substantial and direct economic benefits to Ger area&#13;
residents, although difficult to quantify, and this component will also play a catalytic role&#13;
to induce further improvements in the Ger area.&#13;
C. AFFORDABILITY&#13;
6.7   Water Supply Components. The combination of nearby good-quality water and&#13;
charging systems based on the norms of 150 lcd makes the water bill well affordable to&#13;
apartment dwellers, accounting for 0.44 percent of the average income. The project's&#13;
introduction of a penalizing step tariff is meant to discourage water wastage for those&#13;
consuming more than 230 lcd, but would not affect the affordability for normal&#13;
households who would consume less than 230 lcd. Special care will be taken to reduce&#13;
the unit cost of water in real terms to apartment dwellers in introducing the step tariff so&#13;
that the actual burden to the household consuming 230 lcd will remain the same as&#13;
before. As for ger consumers, with the dramatic downward adjustment of water charges&#13;
and growing incomes, the financial burden will slowly decrease from about 1 percent to&#13;
0.4 percent of the average income in 2000. The drop in price of ger water is so huge that&#13;
it can more than compensate for the anticipated twofold increase in per capita&#13;
consumption and still enhance the affordability to ger residents.&#13;
6.8   Ger Area Infrastructure Improvement.  To ensure that the ger area&#13;
infrastructure charge is affordable, it would be established as 1 percent of average ger&#13;
incomes. Annual revisions by MUB of the charge applied to a ger area scheduled for&#13;
improvement would reflect increases in improvement costs in the previous year, but&#13;
would not exceed increases in the previous year's ger incomes. Also, the additional&#13;
household payments for improvement costs would be fully offset by reductions in&#13;
household expenditure on piped water from kiosks at the greatly reduced unit prices to be&#13;
realigned during the project implementation period. Ger beneficiaries would also pay&#13;
user fees for the sanitation component (bathhouses and laundries). The level of the fee&#13;
would aim at full cost recovery of the operating costs, while taking into account ger&#13;
beneficiaries' capacity to pay for the services. As the bathhouses and laundries will be&#13;
connected to the ger piped water system, it is anticipated that the cost of water for&#13;
providing the services should be substantially reduced, thereby increasing the prospects&#13;
for cost recovery with affordable charges. Assurances were obtained from MUB during&#13;
negotiations that. (a) user charges for ger improvements would be established by March&#13;
31, 1998, and deposited in a Municipal Ger Area Infrastructure account, the sources of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
which are to be usedfor additional ger infrastructure improvements or their maintenance&#13;
unless otherwise agreed with IDA; (b) by commencement of the improvement program it&#13;
will adopt a scheme acceptable to the Association protecting the interests of ger area&#13;
residents, contributing to the ger infrastructure program and presently without any land&#13;
title.&#13;
D. RISKS&#13;
6.9   As the first urban project in a rapidly changing transitional economy, the project&#13;
faces a number of risks. These risks have been identified and mitigating measures&#13;
developed to reduce the overall project risk to acceptable levels.&#13;
6.10 Project Management. With MUB's thin capacity for project management and&#13;
relatively little exposure to IDA's procurement procedures, the project faces the risk of&#13;
implementation delays. However, AusAID-funded technical assistance has helped the&#13;
Municipality prepare major procurement packages for the first and second project years,&#13;
amounting to 25 percent of all project procurement. The project also allocates about $0.7&#13;
million for technical assistance in project implementation to ensure the availability of&#13;
appropriate expertise. In addition, a government official from MID, who is seconded to&#13;
the Bank Group for a year, will work full-time for the project during its implementation.&#13;
Frequent IDA supervision of the project during the first two years of implementation&#13;
would also provide strong startup support.&#13;
6.11  Institutional Risk. A relatively high degree of risk is inherent in enterprise&#13;
restructuring and commercialization in any transition economy.   The proposed&#13;
restructuring and institutional change in USAG is no exception. However, actions taken&#13;
during project preparation and planned for the implementation period should offset part&#13;
of this risk. These include: (a) the firm commitment of municipal authorities at the&#13;
highest levels to USAG's commercial reorientation and the reforms to be introduced;&#13;
(b) USAG staffs growing understanding of the proposed changes as a result of&#13;
discussions held during project preparation; (c) technical assistance and training to be&#13;
provided under the project to facilitate key reforms; and (d) the phased approach to&#13;
reorganization taken under USAG's Institutional Development Action Plan and its&#13;
inclusion of measures to reduce the pain of restructuring, such as staff downsizing&#13;
through attrition and retraining of redundant staff for new positions. These measures,&#13;
coupled with the potential demonstration effect to other state-owned enterprises of&#13;
USAG's commercialization, make this risk acceptable.&#13;
6.12  Although ongoing and expected market-oriented reforms in the municipality&#13;
would act to underpin project reform, possible development in some parts of the city and&#13;
the potential privatization of land could diminish or erase the benefits of the project's ger&#13;
infrastructure improvements to poor ger residents.&#13;
6.13  Cost Recovery. USAG's cost recovery will depend on MUB's willingness to&#13;
make timely and adequate adjustments to the water supply tariff in line with cost&#13;
increases. While both the central and municipal governments have made cost recovery&#13;
for municipal services a central feature of their urban strategies, the performance of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50-&#13;
economy-which cannot be predicted with any certainty-will strongly affect the&#13;
announced political commitment. As part of the Sector Improvement Action Plan,&#13;
USAG and MUB have agreed to undertake biannual reviews of USAG's two year&#13;
financial projections with the recommended tariff and structure to meet the financial&#13;
covenant (para. 5.13).  In ger areas, the level of cost recovery for the proposed&#13;
Infrastructure Account as well as the fee for public baths and other facilities would be&#13;
decided within affordability limits and would be implemented with active participation of&#13;
the local community.&#13;
6.14 Consumer Response to Block Metering. Although block metering would not be&#13;
as effective an incentive as individual metering to discourage waste, potential consumer&#13;
resistance to decreasing wastage will be countered by the introduction of a penalizing&#13;
step-tariff for excessive consumption. This will be complemented by investment in&#13;
fixture repairs, vigorous public awareness program to promote water conservation, and&#13;
the planned introduction of a new system for collecting housing management fees, which&#13;
will group a small number of apartments in one collection unit.&#13;
6.15  Technical Risks. The risks involved in cold climate engineering have been&#13;
mitigated by enlisting the advice of a consultant with extensive Alaskan experience to&#13;
ensure appropriate project designs. The engineering alternatives selected for the project&#13;
are already in use on other schemes in more severe climactic conditions, which use the&#13;
technology incorporated in the project design.&#13;
E. SENSITIVITY TEST&#13;
6.16  A test to measure the sensitivity of EIRR of the water supply component was&#13;
carried out for major variables, including different level of water consumption by ger&#13;
residents as well as apartment residents. If the average water consumption by ger&#13;
residents turns out to be 15 lcd and 25 lcd, rather than assumed 20 lcd, the resultant EIRR&#13;
would change to 13.2 and 17.2 percent, respectively. Likewise, if the average apartment&#13;
resident consumes 200 lcd and 250 lcd of water instead of 230 lcd in the base case, the&#13;
EIRR would be 16.1 and 13.8 percent, respectively. This is consistent with the analysis,&#13;
as the major sources of economic benefits are increased welfare in ger area and the&#13;
savings of valuable resources from the reduction of waste in apartments. Thus, even&#13;
under the unfavorable scenarios of lower water consumption in ger area or less than&#13;
expected level of wastage reduction in apartments, the project remains viable. It is also&#13;
important to note that, under both scenarios, the effect on the financial viability of the&#13;
project is negligible.&#13;

ANNEX 1: THE ULAANBAATAR WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Prior to 1950, Ulaanbaatar (UB) had relatively few inhabitants who lived&#13;
exclusively in gers and took their water from the Tuul River. But with significant&#13;
population growth, the tanking of water became necessary in 1950, with deliveries made&#13;
directly to family plots. Wells were also used but, by 1965, they were closed due to&#13;
pollution and the system of water sales kiosks was established.&#13;
2.    Also from about 1958, the construction of a piped water reticulation system was&#13;
established in the city's formally developed area and that system has been extended and&#13;
improved since then. The water supplied to the system is primarily from aquifers and is&#13;
obtained from wellfields with numbers of boreholes, each with its submersible pump.&#13;
Once lifted from the boreholes, the water is chlorinated before being pumped to supply.&#13;
These networks directly supply the formally developed areas of the city, while the peri-&#13;
urban areas still rely on the operation of a road tanker fleet that obtains most of its supply&#13;
via filling stations connected to the water mains.&#13;
3.    The present supply system suffers from aging assets, intermittent supplies and&#13;
lack of pressure in the pipelines, with the consequent risk of contamination.&#13;
WATER DEMAND&#13;
4.    In 1995, water demand in UB totaled about 161,935 m3/d, of which 121,532 m3/d&#13;
from apartments (296,420 persons at 410 lcd), 38,159 m3/d from industry, and 2.244 m3 /d&#13;
from ger residents (224,443 persons at 10 lcd). UB's 74,000 apartments with hot and&#13;
cold running water housed about 323,000 in 1995, of whom 296,420 were supplied from&#13;
the municipal water supply network.&#13;
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM&#13;
5.    Supply Sources. There are four existing water supply sources called the Upper,&#13;
Central, Industrial and Meat Complex. They all extract groundwater from aquifers along&#13;
the Tuul River. The groundwater source capacity has been investigated and found to&#13;
have potential for future development.&#13;
6.    Upper Source is located about 45 km upstream of UB. Water is collected from 39&#13;
wells, and intake pumps deliver it to 2/1,000 m3 storage reservoirs (Total Water Level,&#13;
TWL, 1,425 m). The water is pumped over a ridge to the "X" reservoir (not yet&#13;
commissioned) and the city. There are six pumps at the pump station, each with a&#13;
nominal capacity of 1,000 m3/hr. The pipeline has a design capacity of 72,000 m3/d, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56-                      ANNEX I&#13;
is currently delivering only 24,000 m3/d, with delivery pressure much less than expected.&#13;
Only 1.2 pumps (operating 20 hr/d) are needed to deliver the current production, so there&#13;
is potential to substantially increase output from the Upper Source. The majority of flow&#13;
from the Upper Source pipeline is proposed to go to the Northeast Reservoir (2/6,000 m3&#13;
tanks with a TWL of 1,387 m), which is not yet in service.&#13;
7.    Central Source is located on the Tuul River near the city center. Water is&#13;
collected from 70 wells and delivered to 10,000 m3 reservoirs (6,000 m3, 3,000 m3, 2/500&#13;
mi3). Its design capacity is 97,000 m 3/d, and it is presently delivering about 90,000 m3/d&#13;
to the city network. The main delivery pipeline comprises 3/600 mm diameter mild steel&#13;
mains that direct flow into the network and toward the Tasgan Reservoir (3/6,000 m3&#13;
tanks) with a TWL of 11,335 m.&#13;
8.    Industrial Source is located downstream of the Central Source and includes 16&#13;
wells with intake pumps that deliver to 2/2,000 mi3 storage reservoirs. The pump station&#13;
contains four pumps with nominal capacities of 2/200 and 2/250 m3/hr. The delivery&#13;
mains to the city network and industrial area are 500, 3/400 and 300 mm diameter mild&#13;
steel mains. The design capacity is 43,000 m 3/day and it is now delivering about 22,000&#13;
m3/d, which means that all four pumps are operating 24 hr/d.&#13;
9.    Meat Complex Source is located downstream of the Industrial source and includes&#13;
8 wells that deliver water to 2/2,000 mi3 storage. The pump station has four pumps with&#13;
nominal capacities of 2/160 and 2/250 m3/hr. The delivery mains to the city network and&#13;
meat processing area are 2,400 and 2/250 mm diameter mild steel mains that now deliver&#13;
about 16,000 m'3/d of flow to the city. This flow will be directed to the Northwest&#13;
reservoir (2/3,000 m3 tanks with TWL of 1,347 m) when it comes into service. All&#13;
pumps are operating 20 hr/d, so there are no standby pumps.&#13;
10.   Reservoirs: Utilization of Unused Capacity in the Proposed Project. There&#13;
are five existing reservoirs in the system on the hills north and east of UB. They are not&#13;
linked to each other, or fully utilized to provide adequate system storage or gravity&#13;
system pressure. USAG and MUB have indicated the inadequate use of the reservoirs is&#13;
due to inadequate information about their level of filling, and that a telemetric system&#13;
would assist in an integrated use of all reservoirs. Nor, with the exception of the&#13;
easternmost (Northeast) reservoir, are they high enough to service by gravity the large ger&#13;
population in the large valley north of UB. To a large extent, pressure is maintained in&#13;
the network by direct pumping from the well-head sources. However, many areas suffer&#13;
from inadequate water supply and pressure, and facilities serving high-rise apartment&#13;
blocks are not equipped to boost-pump water to the higher floors in nine-story buildings.&#13;
11.   The total water storage volume available is 48,000 mi3, of which only 24,000 m 3 is&#13;
currently used. Fifty percent of constructed service storage remains a dormant asset due&#13;
to weak points (weak valves and pipe segments), particularly in the northeastern section&#13;
of the deteriorated city network, which would not withstand the higher pressures caused&#13;
by putting the reservoirs in service. While pipe segments are designed for working&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
pressure of 100 to 120 m, in practice they break at about 60 to 80 m head. The proposed&#13;
project would therefore rehabilitate the transmission system and commission the&#13;
reservoirs in order to increase pressure in the system, provide a continuous water supply&#13;
and make more water available to users.&#13;
12.   The "X" Reservoir. The unused "X" reservoir was constructed to operate as a&#13;
break pressure tank to limit pressures into the city network, transmission system&#13;
weaknesses delayed reservoir commission. The reservoir comprises 2/3,000 m3 tanks&#13;
with TWL of 1,430 m. With the reservoir, the hydraulic head developed at the location&#13;
where the main transmission main enters the city is around 1,385 m, whereas current&#13;
pressures are about 1,350 m. With this available head, the pressures are enough to supply&#13;
flows by gravity directly to the Northeast Reservoir, also now unused. This would allow&#13;
the Northeast Reservoir, commanding pressures from an elevation of 1,382 m, to function&#13;
as a supply reservoir for the Hailast Reservoir to be constructed under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
13.   "3/4" and Northeast Reservoirs. The "3/4" Reservoir would be mobilized to&#13;
serve both as a supply reservoir for the immediate city network and to fill up the two&#13;
adjacent lower reservoirs, the Northwestern and the Tasgan. As the highest of the three&#13;
reservoirs, the "3/4" can also be used to supplement the other two reservoirs and thereby&#13;
eliminate the need for the pumping now carried out from the Tasgan reservoir to the city&#13;
network, as well as to fill the Northwest reservoir. A 500 mm diameter northern link&#13;
would also provide additional filling capacity into the Northeast reservoir, for which&#13;
supply would be to both the city network and to the ger reservoir at Hailast.&#13;
14.   Northwestern Reservoir. The project's southern link pipeline will provide a&#13;
direct connection to the Northwestern Reservoir from the upper source.&#13;
15.   Raw Water Pipelines. There are about 98 km of unlined mild steel pipelines&#13;
conveying the raw water from the well intake pumps to the source storages.&#13;
16.   Water Quality. A JICA study indicates that the water generally complies with&#13;
Mongolian and World Health Organization standards, although levels of chrome,&#13;
manganese and fluoride occasionally exceed desirable levels in one of the aquifers close&#13;
to the industrial zone.&#13;
17.   Distribution System. Each of the four main water source works delivers water to&#13;
its supply system. These systems are interconnected at strategic locations but do not&#13;
incorporate either flow or pressure control. The pipes are of steel or cast iron and range&#13;
in diameter from 100 mm to 800 mm. Generally, pipes are laid at a depth of 3 to 3.5 m.&#13;
The system was built from 1958 to 1990 and extends some 240 km.&#13;
18.   The delivery of water to the distribution networks is by pumping: first from the&#13;
ground reservoirs at the source works and thereafter either from USAG's booster stations&#13;
or from the Central Heating Point (CTP) stations or booster pumps at individual&#13;
buildings. The supply of water therefore depends on the continued availability of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
electrical power at various locations around the city, and since this is intermittent, so too&#13;
is the availability of water. When power is off, the pressure in the water mains is lost and&#13;
vacuum conditions develop, thus drawing in air to the pipework. Where the integrity of&#13;
underground pipes is poor, this negative pressure can draw groundwater into the system,&#13;
thereby creating contamination.&#13;
19.   Except for sections supplied by the "Tasgan" and "3/4" reservoirs, the water&#13;
supply network "floats" on the pumping plant that has to respond to diurnal changes in&#13;
demand. This method of operations is inefficient and provides a poor level o f service.&#13;
20.   Pipe Materials Used and Cold Climate Effects. Pipes are either steel or cast&#13;
iron, with no internal lining or protection. The outside of some pipe is coated with&#13;
bitumen or wrapped with asphalt sheets. Lack of internal protection leads to rust stains,&#13;
one of the main causes of discoloration in the water supply. Trench depths are usually 2&#13;
to 3 m, and there appears to be a lack of control during installation of the trenching&#13;
methods and provision of adequate bedding and compacting of materials. Pipe joints are&#13;
generally caulked and without adequate maintenance may have deteriorated and be a&#13;
major cause of the pipelines not withstanding high pressures. Pressure above about 60 to&#13;
80 m results in significant leakages into pipe and appurtenances. A common practice to&#13;
prevent the pipelines from freezing is to install cold water pipes in the same trench as&#13;
heating or hot water pipes, but this is limited to installations at and downstream of the&#13;
CTPs.&#13;

1.    This component deals with three different aspects of the system  and its&#13;
operations:&#13;
(a)   strengthening of the existing network and removal of bottlenecks on the&#13;
primary distribution network;&#13;
(b)   the construction of additional distribution facilities to improve the service&#13;
in ger areas and to reduce the access cost to users, and;&#13;
(c)   the implementation of a water wastage reduction program for apartment&#13;
areas aimed at bringing overall consumption levels, which are now&#13;
inordinately high and reflect major losses to leakage, in line with more&#13;
typical levels through control by metering and replacement of leaking&#13;
facilities.&#13;

transmission main (3.0 km of 300 mm diameter), linking between the&#13;
reservoirs at Northwest, 3/4 district, Tasgan and Northeast locations&#13;
(18.0 km of 500/400/300 mm diameter) and the southern links for the&#13;
city's network main (12 km of 400 mm diameter);&#13;
(b)   rehabilitation and commissioning of the Northeast and X reservoirs,&#13;
coupled with installation of a telemetry system intended to optimize use of&#13;
the reservoirs;&#13;
(c)   the repair and replacement of existing valves and installation of regulating&#13;
valves to increase pressures on secondary networks presently ill served;&#13;
and&#13;

ANNEX 4: WATER SUPPLY METERING&#13;
1.   It is Government policy to introduce metering and to support the principle of&#13;
"user pays" pricing for all water and electricity consumers. A Government decree was&#13;
passed in 1995 that stipulates that water and electricity meters would be installed in all&#13;
individual premises by 1998. However, this involves a substantial financial commitment,&#13;
and implementation of the policy has not yet commenced. Previous studies carried out in&#13;
1994/95 under the Ministry of Energy's responsibility, have highlighted the extent of&#13;
water wastage and losses in apartment buildings, and the potential for substantial&#13;
reductions in water supply operating costs if these losses can be eliminated.&#13;
CURRENT SITUATION&#13;
2.    Ulaanbaatar's water supply network was initially equipped with water meters at&#13;
all distribution booster stations (CTP), which are located ahead of the secondary networks&#13;
serving apartment networks; all wells and pumping stations were installed without any&#13;
meter. Most of these meters have ceased functioning over time, and the water company,&#13;
USAG, has found it impossible to determine overall production rates from the wells or&#13;
amounts pumped in each of the CTPs for hot and cold water boosted to the block&#13;
buildings of the apartments.&#13;
3.    Downstream of the CTP and secondary networks, design of piping in apartments&#13;
has generally included within each stairwell two cold water rising pipes and one hot water&#13;
rising pipe. Except in the most recently constructed buildings, there is no returning hot&#13;
water pipe. All networks downstream of a CTP are currently owned and maintained by&#13;
the 17 subsidiaries of the Housing and Maintenance Service Company (OSNAAK).&#13;
These 17 subsidiaries, named kantors, are physically responsible for at least one pumping&#13;
station (CTP), a few small stocking reservoirs, the secondary networks and all plumbing&#13;
facilities in the apartment buildings.&#13;
4.    USAG remains responsible for direct water service to industries, institutional&#13;
clients such as schools and hospitals and a very limited number of domestic customers in&#13;
the center of the city. There are about 1,060 accounts directly managed by USAG.&#13;
Although 100 of these accounts are metered and have operating meters, most of the&#13;
billing has been carried out on the basis of norms established over time based on Soviet&#13;
standards and applied for both design and billing of consumers. USAG bills the CTPs on&#13;
the basis of a domestic water consumption of 150 liters per capita per day, whereas recent&#13;
water consumption surveys have demonstrated that apartment inhabitants can consume as&#13;
much as 410 lcd.&#13;
5.    The current situation of water losses in the primary distribution system owned and&#13;
maintained by USAG remains very unclear as no survey of water losses has been carried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                     ANNEX4&#13;
out; USAG indicates that water breakages on these primary mains occur about 20 to 30&#13;
times per year. Water losses and wastage are far higher in secondary networks and&#13;
apartment plumbing fixtures. The kantors do not keep records of the number of pipe&#13;
breakages on the secondary network, but their managers state that the number of&#13;
plumbers within each kantor (one person per 1,200 to 2,000 apartments) is insufficient to&#13;
face demands caused by leaks on secondary networks, block apartment buildings and&#13;
internal apartment properties. A survey conducted in 1994 with the introduction of&#13;
experimental metering in two apartment buildings demonstrated that: (a) initially, water&#13;
consumption was at about 310 to 330 lcd; (b) after undertaking a fixture replacement&#13;
program on one building and setting individual meters on each apartment pipe riser, water&#13;
consumption dropped to about 163 lcd, while it remained at about 240 lcd without any&#13;
fixture repair program; (c) apartment inhabitants were highly conscious of the need to&#13;
conserve water by closing water taps whenever repaired, and sensitive to the introduction&#13;
of water billing based on actual consumption and had started requesting more frequent&#13;
plumbing assistance from kantor staff to maintain as low a water wastage as possible.&#13;
The survey also pointed out that the pattern of consumption also changed, with metered&#13;
apartments using much less cold water in total and percentage terms.&#13;
STRATEGY AND PROPOSALS&#13;
6.    In view of the extreme difficulty of obtaining reliable data to rationalize water&#13;
utilization and develop a satisfactory billing system, Mongolia's professional community&#13;
has recognized the need to urgently reintroduce metering and provide incentives to the&#13;
population to control the water wastage occurring either through abusive use of both hot&#13;
and cold water or leaking faucets and apartment fixtures and the deteriorating stock of&#13;
leaky pipes outside apartment properties. A first effort is under way under a preliminary&#13;
JICA-financed initiative focusing on the study and strengthening of UB's water&#13;
production assets. The JICA funding would include provision of water meters to monitor&#13;
water production by the pumping stations and installation of about 51 water meters at the&#13;
37 CTPs. This program would be completed before the end of 1997. JICA also intends&#13;
to fund the metering and automation of pumping stations of all production facilities over&#13;
the next few years.&#13;
7.    Three options for apartment metering have been considered:  (a) metering&#13;
individual apartments; (b) metering building cores (i.e., typically groups of 12 to 27&#13;
apartments); or (c) metering buildings separately (i.e., groups of more than 60&#13;
apartments). Cost estimates are, respectively, $7.7 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million.&#13;
It is recognized that metering individual apartments may be adopted because it is most&#13;
socially equitable, and metering buildings separately is the least expensive and equitable&#13;
and would be the least likely to achieve significant water conservation. However, the&#13;
proposed option, metering building cores, is a compromise because of its acceptable cost&#13;
to the community and because it can commence the process of linking responsibility for&#13;
water consumption with the cost of water to apartment residents. It also follows logically&#13;
from the CTPs' metering and is a timely step in the process of introducing volume-based&#13;
charging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                     ANNEX4&#13;
8.    UB has some 755 apartment buildings with 2,618 building cores. Metering at the&#13;
stairwell level would require a total of about 3,200 metering points on the water risers; a&#13;
first survey of existing internal plumbing piping leading to the apartments shows that&#13;
there should be four meters at the base of each column to appropriately capture the&#13;
consumption of each set of stairwell residents. A more extensive survey of local&#13;
conditions is being carried out by kantors to identify the issues in developing stairwell&#13;
metering and preparing standards for equipment and installation of this major metering&#13;
undertaking.&#13;
9.    Discussions indicate agreements on the following points:&#13;
(a)   meters should be owned by USAG while being left to the responsibility of&#13;
the kantors who will be charged a maintenance fee by USAG. The repair&#13;
and maintenance of meters would be carried out at the kantors' request, by&#13;
USAG who would receive adequate testing equipment and meter spares to&#13;
carry out its maintenance role;&#13;
(b)   meter installation would be carried out by kantors' staff; the supply will&#13;
come from USAG and would include all parts to allow satisfactory&#13;
installation and potential dismantling for repair;&#13;
(c)   a first survey of typical installation conditions will be carried out in Spring&#13;
1997 to ensure good knowledge of location conditions and the nature of&#13;
parts;&#13;
(d)   the purchase of some 22,000 meters for block metering of both hot and&#13;
cold water will be included under the Credit; a first tranche of some 5,000&#13;
meters would be bid during the Year 1 implementation period, so that&#13;
installation could start by end- 1997 and extend through winter 1997-98.&#13;
10.   Trade, Industrial and Institutional Metering. USAG will resume billing of all&#13;
trade, institutional and industrial customers it used to bill according to actual&#13;
consumption. New meters would be purchased as part of the project under the first&#13;
tranche of meters supplied. As for the apartment meters, USAG would own the meters,&#13;
and would charge a rental and maintenance fee to the customer.&#13;
11.   Development of Billing Systems. The present billing system established at the&#13;
kantor level needs to be overhauled and account for the reforms introduced with the&#13;
privatization of the housing market; these new systems should also ensure that customers&#13;
can be later billed according to the quantity of water consumed. The issuance of water&#13;
supply bills by the kantors will ensure that the latter retain the responsibility and expertise&#13;
to address maintenance issues at the building block level. Kantors are also the most&#13;
appropriate unit to keep information on population and residences, and are the most&#13;
amenable to ensure appropriate collection of water bills together with other utility&#13;
charges. While ultimately through the privatization process this billing and collection&#13;
function might return to each individual utility (heating, water, power, solid wastes), the&#13;
preparation of billing systems should be devised to permit this potential change of future&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                    ANNEX4&#13;
responsibility and maintain similarity in systems across each kantor's own systems.&#13;
Similarly, USAG will need to recast it own billing system and introduce mechanisms to:&#13;
(a) obtain payment other than through bank account compensation, and (b) monitor&#13;
effective payments for the introduction of disconnection policies.&#13;
FIXTURE REPAIR PROGRAM&#13;
12.   This program aims at helping the apartment users reduce substantially the water&#13;
wastage within their apartment. The above-mentioned survey has shown that many taps&#13;
are not closing properly, many toilets are flowing constantly and occasionally internal&#13;
building piping is corroded and leaks. Under the same survey, repairs then effected&#13;
resulted in substantial water consumption reduction in the whole building and greater&#13;
apartment residents' awareness of controlling their own consumption and continuing to&#13;
repair fixtures that resumed leaking. The current program would tentatively follow an&#13;
identical approach.&#13;
(a)   It is proposed that under the project USAG would purchase various parts&#13;
and fixtures needed to replace defective plumbing parts. These purchases&#13;
would be carried out over a three-year period according to needs and to&#13;
progress of the replacement campaign;&#13;
(b)   USAG would pass on the equipment to OSNAAK and the kantors and&#13;
charge them for the equipment cost on terms and conditions to be defined&#13;
over the next two months by the two organizations;&#13;
(c)   The kantors and OSNAAK  would in turn carry out the fixture&#13;
replacement. To provide reliable estimates of equipment needs and to&#13;
sensitize apartment residents, a preliminary investigation will be launched&#13;
by kantor staff over the next two months. This survey would help clarify&#13;
the modalities under which the carnpaign should be carried out, in&#13;
particular (i) the time when it should follow the metering campaign; and&#13;
(ii) the need to tackle all repairs within one building at a time; and the&#13;
terms of repayment for the equipment from the residents to the kantors (a&#13;
period of about one to two years with a down payment of, say, 20 percent&#13;
of the equipment cost would seem appropriate goals). The review of the&#13;
proposed modalities will be discussed in April with the IDA appraisal&#13;
mission and OSNAAK and kantors, and results of the surveys should be&#13;
available to the Project Office before then.&#13;
PILOT EXPERIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL METERING&#13;
13.   At the request of the Municipality and USAG, the project would include a pilot&#13;
program aiming at individual metering of apartment premises to be carried out in one or&#13;
two buildings during the second half of the project. The program would examine the&#13;
increased benefits of single apartment metering versus bloc building metering, in&#13;
particular the gain in water consumption monitoring and improvements realized in the&#13;
management and billing.&#13;

- 71-                      ANNEXSB&#13;
ANNEX 5B: USAG: CURRENT ORGANIZATION AND&#13;
DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN&#13;
Legal Status&#13;
14.   USAG, Ulaanbaatar's state-owned water and wastewater entity, has not been&#13;
registered under the 1995 Company Law, as it should have been, because of (a) lack of&#13;
the governing and auditing bodies required by the Company Law, and (b) Articles of&#13;
Association not in accordance with the Law. New draft Articles have been prepared and&#13;
will be revised to reflect the 1995 Company Law before they are approved by the&#13;
Municipality and duly registered. USAG's subscribed and unpaid capital have not been&#13;
properly estimated and updated due to the lack of assets revaluation. With completion of&#13;
these requirements, USAG's new legal status would give it more autonomy, although its&#13;
tariff structure and levels would remain under the Municipality's control. On attaining&#13;
company status, a performance contract should be finalized between the Municipality and&#13;
USAG to regulate municipal obligations regarding the tariff level and provide USAG&#13;
with required performance indicators.&#13;
Organizational Structure&#13;
15.   USAG's organizational structure has a horizontal configuration indicating that the&#13;
General Manager is responsible for most decision-making. Its organizational chart also&#13;
combines two bodies: USAG as well as the previously existing TANK Company, which&#13;
was incorporated into USAG but retained the organizational structure developed before&#13;
the incorporation. Furthermore, USAG's water- and sewer-related activities are not&#13;
separated in its operational divisions; for example, the Maintenance Division deals with&#13;
both the water and sewerage network. With such a structure, USAG cannot distinguish&#13;
its water and wastewater costs and therefore lacks adequate management information on&#13;
the performance of each part of the system. USAG also needs to arrange for establishing&#13;
the governing and auditing bodies required by the Company Law.&#13;
Operations and Maintenance&#13;
16.   USAG operates a water supply system that currently includes 300 km of water&#13;
pipelines and well fields of some 1 10 wells and pump stations, while the sewerage system&#13;
has an 80-km network that feeds into a wastewater treatment plant before discharge. In&#13;
addition, USAG/TANK provides water supply for the ger areas through 262 public water&#13;
kiosks, transporting water to the kiosks by water tanker trucks. Maintenance of all its&#13;
assets is very poor, comprising renovations, repairs and facility replacement carried out&#13;
only when absolutely necessary and often on an emergency basis. There are no specific&#13;
maintenance procedures, and many devices in the system do not work. The maintenance&#13;
budget is woefully insufficient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72 -                      ANNEX 5B&#13;
Financial and Accounting Statements&#13;
17.   The existing accounting system does not comply with international standards.&#13;
The system does not reflect costs related to each cost-generating center, and it is&#13;
impossible to determine whether or not the costs are reflected in water and wastewater&#13;
charges. Financial management is essentially limited to very basic budgeting without any&#13;
financial analysis. An asset revaluation system is virtually nonexistent.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
18.   USAG employs 1,074 people (including 442 in TANK). Considering the scope of&#13;
services provided by USAG, the company appears overstaffed. The typical efficiency&#13;
indicator for water supply and sewerage companies-i.e., the number of employees per&#13;
km of network operated-is very high for USAG: 632 persons for 380 km or 1.66&#13;
persons per km compared to a common standard of 0.45 staff per km. The wastewater&#13;
treatment plant, with 128 personnel, seems particularly overstaffed. USAG's managers&#13;
have technical, rather than financial and economics, training; only four managers have&#13;
university degrees in economics and no lawyer is on the staff.  Throughout the&#13;
organization, older staff predominate. Training is needed in all positions, especially in&#13;
advanced management techniques and up-to-date financial and accounting practices and&#13;
procedures for senior managers.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING GOALS&#13;
19.   The main objective of USAG's institutional strengthening is to create an&#13;
enterprise capable of assuming greater autonomy in its operations and management, and&#13;
operating in a commercially-oriented environment.&#13;
20.   USAG's strengthening would be based on an institutional study prepared with&#13;
assistance from Australian consulting engineers, Sinclair Knight Merz, in July 1996. The&#13;
findings of the study, which included recommendations for USAG's reorganization and&#13;
improvement, were discussed with USAG's management during April 1997, and an&#13;
institutional action plan, incorporating modifications suggested by USAG, was confirmed&#13;
at that time.&#13;
USAG's DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN&#13;
21.   Regularization of Legal Status. The IDA Appraisal mission reviewed USAG's&#13;
existing Articles of Association and found them too general and not consistent with the&#13;
Upper Law. These Articles need further amendments to clarify: (a) the role of the Owner&#13;
and the Governing Board; (b) the legal responsibility, whether a limited liability company&#13;
or an State-owned enterprise; (c) procedure for establishing the Governing Board and&#13;
selecting its members, as well as its duties, powers and responsibilities; (d) procedures&#13;
and responsibility for tariff setting; and (e) USAG's authority to borrow funds from&#13;
domestic and international sources. The Municipality and USAG have agreed to revise&#13;
USAG's Articles prepared early May 1997 and to provide them to the Bank for further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                     ANNEX5B&#13;
review and comment. Subsequently, after submission of the completed Application Form&#13;
approved by the State Property Agency, the Articles will be formally registered in the&#13;
State Register. Formal registration is expected to be completed by July 1, 1997. With&#13;
this, USAG will become a company with autonomy given through incorporation of its&#13;
Articles according to requirements of the Company Law.&#13;
22.   Organizational Restructuring. USAG's structure needs reorganization for two&#13;
main reasons:&#13;
*  The current outdated, inefficient organizational structure prevents efficient&#13;
operations and satisfactory financial and technical performance;&#13;
*  During and after implementation of the proposed project, new needs for water&#13;
services will arise, requiring additional capabilities in USAG.&#13;
* Within this context, USAG's internal reorganization would be implemented&#13;
gradually, in keeping with progress of the project's physical execution. The&#13;
following phased program for USAG's internal reorganization is&#13;
recommended.&#13;
Phase I: Separation of Water Supply and Wastewater Activities and Integration of the&#13;
TANK Company into USA G's Structure&#13;
23.   To distinguish water and wastewater expenditures in order to identify specific&#13;
costs and estimate appropriate water and sewer tariffs, the following change is&#13;
recommended:&#13;
* Transfer of sewer maintenance responsibility and activities without staff&#13;
transfer from USAG's Maintenance Department to a newly established&#13;
subdivision for this purpose in the Wastewater Treatment Plant.&#13;
24.   To integrate the TANK  company into USAG, the following steps are&#13;
recommended:&#13;
*  Incorporation of TANK staff for accounting, finance and personnel into&#13;
appropriate USAG divisions.&#13;
*  Incorporation of the kiosk maintenance division into USAG's new Building&#13;
Department dealing with all building structures.&#13;
*  Assumption  by USAG's existing Customer Services Department of&#13;
responsibility for collecting charges for ger area services formerly provided by&#13;
TANK and incorporation of kiosk operators into this Department.&#13;
25.   Phase I should begin immediately and be completed during the first six months of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74-                      ANNEX 5B&#13;
Phase 11: Reorganization during Implementation of the Project's Physical Investment&#13;
Program&#13;
26.   Implementation of the project's ger area water supply program and installation of&#13;
water meters in apartment blockhouses will create a need for additional services from&#13;
USAG. The new ger area water supply network will require maintenance, and the meters&#13;
installed in the apartment blockhouses as well as those in institutions, industry, CTPs will&#13;
require special maintenance services. The following changes for these purposes are&#13;
proposed:&#13;
*  Establishment of a Metering Department responsible for meter installation,&#13;
maintenance, replacement and calibration.&#13;
*  Strengthening of the Customer Services Department to handle meter reading,&#13;
billing, and collection, provision of demand forecasts for water supply&#13;
planning, dealing with customers' requests and complaints, and maintaining a&#13;
customer register by duureg, khoroo and plot. The project would provide&#13;
appropriate computer hardware, software and training for these purposes.&#13;
* Expansion of the Water Maintenance Department with operators responsible&#13;
for ger area water pipelines maintenance.&#13;
27.   This phase should begin during the second year of project implementation, in&#13;
combination with the physical installation of meters.&#13;
Phase III: AdditionalActivities&#13;
28.   USAG, as the company responsible for the municipal water and wastewater&#13;
system, should be responsible for all types of water-related activities. Therefore, it is&#13;
recommended that planning of water supply and sewerage investments as well as&#13;
supervision of investment implementation be transferred from the Municipality to USAG.&#13;
This would entail, in order of priority:.&#13;
.  Expansion of USAG's Technical Department with staff responsible for&#13;
mapping, establishment of quality standards, and assets evidence.&#13;
*  In the future, USAG may also need to establish additional departments&#13;
responsible for planning and execution of investments, preparation of small&#13;
construction works and some designs&#13;
This phase could be undertaken during or after project completion.&#13;
29.   With continued privatization of the Mongolian economy, privatization of the&#13;
water kiosks is may be envisioned. In this case, all kiosks and their operators would be&#13;
excluded from  USAG and become USAG's customers.  In addition, tank truck&#13;
privatization by leasing trucks to drivers would enable USAG to operate more efficiently,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                      ANNEX5B&#13;
with fewer employees and equipment. USAG could then focus on its true business sector&#13;
activities.&#13;
Human Resources Management and Staff Allocation&#13;
30.   To address the human resource management and development issues related to&#13;
USAG's reorganization and overstaffing, the following actions are recommended:&#13;
Purpose                            Training Needs&#13;
Sewerage maintenance responsibilities, but no staff, to be    About 20 WWTP staff to&#13;

now overstaffed Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).   maintenance.&#13;
New Meter Maintenance Department to be established with  10 staff to be recruited&#13;
10 staff to handle meter installation, repair, calibration, and  from Water Supply&#13;
data retention and monitoring                        Maintenance Dept. and&#13;
appropriate technical&#13;
training provided.&#13;
Customer Services Dept. to be responsible for meter reading  15 staff to be trained.&#13;
(4 staff to be added), provision to Accounting Dept. of&#13;
customer information, and handling of customer requests and&#13;
complaints.&#13;
Number of working tank trucks to be decreased due to piped About 40 staff to be trained&#13;
distribution of water to ger areas. Old depreciated trucks to in new tasks.&#13;
be sold at auction. About 40 drivers and tank filling&#13;
operators to transfer to Water Supply Maintenance Dept. to&#13;
cover new service area and newly constructed kiosks.&#13;
31.   Attrition: A Solution to Overstaffing. USAG should address its overstaffing&#13;
problem by implementing a gradual, steady staff reduction program based on the&#13;
following assumptions:&#13;
* No extension of employment for those eligible for retirement.&#13;
* Release of workers not meeting performance standards for their positions.&#13;
* Release of staff not wishing to participate in the reorganization.&#13;
32.   During project appraisal USAG management agreed that staff would be reduced&#13;
in number from 1,074 presently to 956 by the end of project execution, and that further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-                      ANNEX5B&#13;
reductions would be considered. Currently hiring of new staff in proceeding to match&#13;
those going into retirement (54). Between now and 1999 retirees would not be replaced&#13;
by new recruiters, and staff employed could drop to 961 without any other release. A&#13;
tentative new organizational chart of USAG with the forecast number of staff by 2001 is&#13;
attached to this annex.&#13;
33.   Training of Personnel Department Staff. The Personnel Department should&#13;
undertake the following training, with one staff member made responsible for planning,&#13;
arranging and coordinating the training.&#13;
* Developing advanced techniques of human resources management geared to&#13;
staff selection for all positions based on a comparison of candidates'&#13;
qualifications and experience.&#13;
* Develop a public relations capability within USAG.&#13;
34.   Timing. Preparation of a detailed training program should begin immediately and&#13;
be completed by October 1, 1997. Thereafter, training would be provided in tandem with&#13;
the reorganization program.&#13;
Maintenance Development&#13;
35.   The maintenance budget should be increased over the 1996 budget in real terms&#13;
by 10 percent annually during the next five years. Thereafter, it should be maintained at a&#13;
level equivalent to the assets depreciation value. The maintenance fund to be established&#13;
would finance necessary equipment (e.g., pipe locators, plugs for closing off sewers,&#13;
sewer cleaning equipment, and meter calibration equipment). The proposed project&#13;
would finance technical assistance in maintenance and for development of a&#13;
comprehensive asset management program.&#13;
36.   Maintenance Department staff would receive training in the following areas:&#13;
*  Operation of water leakage detection equipment: 2 workers&#13;
*  Operation, installation, calibration and maintenance of water meters:  8&#13;
workers&#13;
*  Preparation of manuals giving detailed procedures for carrying out all&#13;
operations: 5 workers&#13;
*  Preparation of a comprehensive asset register for use in developing a routine&#13;
maintenance program: 2 persons&#13;
Financial and Accounting Development&#13;
37.  It is recommended that development of USAG's financial and accounting&#13;
capabilities cover the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                    ANNEX SB&#13;
(a)   Separation of Water and Sewerage Costs. It is recommended that water&#13;
and sewerage operations be separated as soon as possible, and by&#13;
January 1, 1999, separate accounts should be kept for each operation in&#13;
order to identify the related costs and set the respective tariffs to cover&#13;
operating costs.  However, the costs of support and administration&#13;
departments, which do not belong to either water or sewerage, should be&#13;
handled by an internal system of charging the operating divisions in&#13;
proportion to their staff numbers.&#13;
(b)   Introduction of International Accounting System. Introduction of a&#13;
new accounting system in compliance with international accounting&#13;
standards should be completed by January 1, 1999. The accounting&#13;
system would allow a determination of real output and input costs related&#13;
to each unit. The proposed project would lay the basis for introducing the&#13;
new system by covering the cost of procuring appropriate computer&#13;
hardware and software and training 10 accounting staff.&#13;
(c)   Establishment of Financial Management System. Technical assistance&#13;
and training would be provided early in the project for developing a&#13;
comprehensive financial management system, including financial analysis&#13;
and projections, annual budgeting and control of income and expenditures.&#13;
38.  Introduction of Management Information System (MIS). An MIS system&#13;
should be developed for use at the highest management level, i.e., USAG's General&#13;
Manager and his deputies.&#13;
39.   USAG institutional operations would be monitored through the use of appropriate&#13;
reporting procedures. Under the above Technical Assistance programs, detailed reporting&#13;
procedures will be discussed with USAG and establish after its approval.&#13;
40.   The following approach is recommended for implementation: Departments and&#13;
subordinated divisions to the senior managers (Chief Engineer, Chief of Finance and&#13;
Administration, Chief of Supporting Activities) should be required to submit monthly&#13;
reports on their activities and responsibilities. The senior managers would synthesize&#13;
those reports and submit summaries to the General Director. Those summary reports, in&#13;
turn, should be reviewed, analyzed, and the General Director would prepare one final&#13;
report for submission to the Governing Board once a month. The Governing Board&#13;
should submit a revised report to the Auditor afterwards. The annual report prepared by&#13;
the General Director, approved by the Governing Board and reviewed by the Auditor,&#13;
would be presented to the Company Owner, the UB Municipality.&#13;
41.   The following monthly reports shall be submitted to the Chief Engineer, which is&#13;
responsible for maintenance:&#13;
(a)   Water Production Report prepared by the Production Department&#13;

ANNEX 6: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TERMS OF&#13;
REFERENCE&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF USAG-TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Government of Mongolia has applied to the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) for a Credit amounting to $16.1 million, which is to be onlent to the&#13;
Water and Sewerage Management Company in Ulaanbaatar (USAG) to support its piped&#13;
connection of water supply to the Ger area kiosks and to improve the efficiency of its&#13;
water distribution network and tariff charging system. USAG intends to apply part of&#13;
these proceeds to develop its institutional capacity, particularly in the area of financial&#13;
and accounting system, management information system (MIS), asset management&#13;
program, billing and collection procedures, and technical training required to enhance the&#13;
skills of staff to meet the new demands envisaged in Institutional Development Action&#13;
Program. Special Technical Assistance (TA) is to be provided under this IDA Project to&#13;
help USAG to achieve these purposes.&#13;
2.    Despite its incorporation under 1991 Company Law, USAG has been working as&#13;
an operating arm of the municipality for daily operation and maintenance of water and&#13;
sewerage, lacking incentives as well as adequate organizational structures and authorities&#13;
as an efficient public utility. Under the Project, however, it is to be formally reorganized&#13;
under the 1995 Company Law with an adequate structure and authorities to ensure more&#13;
financial and operational autonomy to provide incentives for improving efficiency and to&#13;
define clear accountability. A detailed time-bound action program of institutional change&#13;
was agreed and to be implemented. To enhance the efficiency of the USAG through&#13;
institutional restructuring, however, MIS supported by a proper accounting and financial&#13;
management system needs to be put in place.&#13;
3.    Despite a recent government decree to require companies to adopt IAS principles,&#13;
USAG has yet to convert its old system to a new one consistent with IAS. Expected&#13;
change in billing and collection system and the separation of accounts between water&#13;
supply and sewerage operation also calls for corresponding changes. Newly added&#13;
unction of planning, budgeting, and design will also require a proper management&#13;
information system. In addition, development of a comprehensive system to define,&#13;
measure and monitor performances of various units and levels of management is a&#13;
prerequisite to an efficient organization. The TA will support the development of an&#13;
adequate MIS supported by financial and accounting software and procedures consistent&#13;
with IAS and new organizational mandate to improve efficiency of USAG.'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
4.    Although a detailed action program for institutional development focusing on&#13;
streamlining organizational structure and redeployment of staff was agreed to be phased&#13;
into during the project implementation, a strong technical training program to arm&#13;
USAG's staff with required skills and expertise is essential to gamer the efficiency of the&#13;
USAG. Moreover, the agreed action program as well as identified training program also&#13;
would require some adjustments to meet the demands of changing circumstances as well&#13;
as to coordinate with the new MIS system. This would require a component of TA,&#13;
specifically addressing training and other supports for organizational change.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.    The objective of the TA is to enhance the efficiency of USAG by providing&#13;
USAG with a MIS backed up by computerized financial management and accounting&#13;
system that will enable planning, budgeting, control and performance monitoring, and&#13;
with technical training to improve technical competence of staff to help ensure the&#13;
smooth implementation of Action Program of Institutional Development. As such, the&#13;
TA will:&#13;
(a)   Develop/purchase and install computerized MIS backed up be a modem&#13;
financial, accounting and information systems and procedures in the&#13;
USAG; and&#13;
(b)   Train various levels of USAG's management and staff in the use of the&#13;
designed systems and procedures as well as other technical training&#13;
identified in the Action Program of Institutional Development.&#13;
Scope of Works&#13;
6.    Detailed scope of works are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Review the Institutional Development and Financial Aspects reports by&#13;
Sinclair Knight Merz and Staff Appraisal Report by IDA and other&#13;
relevant background reports;&#13;
(b)   Design and implement conversion to the new accounting system with&#13;
supporting rules and procedures to be consistent with IAS: This will&#13;
involve the establishment of basic ledger subsystem that includes, but is&#13;
not limited to, general ledger, accounts receivable, inventory, salaries, and&#13;
fixed assets, as well as setting up of cost centers and the cost accounting&#13;
system that enables separation of the cost between water supply and&#13;
sewerage operation;&#13;
(c)   Review the existing computer hardware and software and based on the&#13;
identified system requirement, help procure and install the required&#13;
hardware and software;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
(d)   Review  and refine the current reporting system, define required&#13;
management and financial reports, particularly in view of the budgeting&#13;
and planning function, and help develop/purchase a financial management&#13;
system to generate required financial data and reports and five-year&#13;
financial projections supported by computerized software as appropriate;&#13;
(e)   Integrate the billing and collection subsystem to be developed by meter&#13;
installation company into the USAG's general MIS;&#13;
(f)   Integrate the maintenance program to be developed under a separate TA&#13;
into the USAG's general MIS;&#13;
(g)   Develop a comprehensive performance indicators to be used to measure&#13;
the performance of various units and level of management as well as&#13;
USAG as a whole and recommend the five-year targets reflecting the&#13;
current and planned institutional capacities;&#13;
(h)   Transfer the expertise in utilizing management information system,&#13;
accounting and financial software as well as accompanies procedures and&#13;
practices through on-the-job training and other venues based on the&#13;
detailed technology transfer program;&#13;
(i)   Review and adjust, if warranted, the Action Program for Institutional&#13;
Development and support the phase-in of Action Program; and&#13;
(j)    Review the training program identified under the Action Program for&#13;
Institutional Development and help carry out the agreed training program;&#13;
Timing and Budget&#13;
7.    The TA will require the services of a team of consultants with expertise in&#13;
financial management, accounting, MIS, and institutional development and organization&#13;
of training. A total of 16 person-months of international consultant input and 13 person-&#13;
months of domestic consultant services will expected. Total budget is estimated to be&#13;
$500,000 including contingencies. It is expected that the whole training program and&#13;
implementation assistance will start in January 1998 and will be finished in December&#13;
1999. The program will be carried out in phases as agreed with USAG.&#13;
8.    The IDA Credit includes funds for the purchase of equipment (e.g., computer&#13;
hardware and software) necessary for the implementation of financial management and&#13;
MIS. The equipment will be purchased by the consultant on behalf on USAG, and in&#13;
accordance with the IDA's procurement guidelines. The equipment will be left with&#13;
USAG upon the completion of the program.&#13;

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTs-TERMS OF&#13;
REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
9.    Water Distribution System. The Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB), Outer&#13;
Mongolia is about to commence implementation of an IDA-assisted Urban Services&#13;
Project, which includes improvements to Ulaanbaatar city's urban water distribution&#13;
system, a major change in the system for supplying water to 12 ger areas (population&#13;
169,400), from truck tanker supply to water-dispensing kiosks, to piped supply to&#13;
existing (280) and additional kiosks and the development of a ring main and reservoir&#13;
system to increase system reliability and efficiency and reduce excessive costs of&#13;
maintaining pressure by pumping.&#13;
10.   Ger areas are largely unserviced housing areas on the fringes of the city, housing&#13;
about 50 percent of UB's population in a mixture of traditional Mongolian tents (the ger),&#13;
wooden frame and some masonry structures.&#13;
11.   Ger Upgrading.  In addition, the project would provide for upgrading&#13;
infrastructure in five of the ger areas that would be obtaining piped water supply. The&#13;
infrastructure would include roads and paths, stormwater drainage and bathhouses and&#13;
washing facilities. The roads and path in particular have been selected to improve access&#13;
water kiosks by ger residents. The stormwater drainage projects aim at alleviating&#13;
flooding, erosion and loss of lives and property in the worst-affected ger areas in UB.&#13;
12.   Metering. All of UB's residential premises, particularly formal housing in&#13;
publicly-owned apartment buildings, and many institutional and industrial premises have&#13;
no water meters. Consumers have mainly been charged on the basis of per capita and&#13;
other "norms," instead of the quantity of water consumed, with the result that USAG is&#13;
earning revenue on less than 50 percent of its bulk water production and water wastage is&#13;
very high. A key component of the project would provide for the procurement and&#13;
installation, over the first three years of the project, of about 14,000 hot and cold water&#13;
meters in about 2,620 apartment blocks (not individual apartment units) and currently&#13;
unmetered institutional premises.&#13;
13.   Fixture Repairs and Replacements. Also, to assist residential consumers to&#13;
reduce water wastage, particularly when they are charged under the project on a&#13;
volumetric rather than normative basis, the project would fund an apartment fixture (taps&#13;
and toilets) repair and replacement program. USAG would bear the costs of the fixtures&#13;
and existing MUB housing management and maintenance organizations-the kantors-&#13;
would repair and install the fixtures.&#13;
14.   Modest provisions for rehabilitating critical elements of the wastewater collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal system are also included in the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
Organizational Arrangements for Project Implementation.&#13;
15.   The water supply component of the Project would be implemented by the Water&#13;
Facilities Exploitation Department Of Ulaanbaatar City (USAG), a wholly MUB-owned&#13;
service operations and maintenance department, which is being converted legally,&#13;
institutionally and technically into a commercially-oriented Municipal Company owned&#13;
by MUB. The ger infrastructure upgrading component would be implemented by MUB's&#13;
Department of Architecture, Planning and Building and MUB Districts (Duuregs) and&#13;
subdistricts (Khoroos). With the assistance of international consultants, the project has&#13;
been prepared by a Project Preparation Group, headed by a Project Director from MUB's&#13;
Department of Architecture and Building and composed of staff from various MUB&#13;
Departments-including MUB's Departments of Construction, Architecture and Building&#13;
and Finance and Planning-the Ministry of Infrastructure Development and USAG. For&#13;
project implementation and management, MUB would establish and maintain a Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU), composed of people deputized from the same agencies that&#13;
prepared and staffed the Project Preparation Group. The PMU would be responsible to&#13;
the MUB Deputy City Manager, through the Chief of the Department of Strategic Policy&#13;
and Planning, which has been assigned direct responsibility for overall Project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
16.   Local consultants would be separately recruited and employed to assist the PMU&#13;
in project management and implementation. These local consultants would work with the&#13;
international consultants from whom MUB seeks assistance under these Terms of&#13;
Reference and who would work with the PMU.&#13;
17.  International and local consultants will also be recruited under the project (with&#13;
separate Terms of Reference) to provide technical assistance to USAG for institutional&#13;
development, training, financial management, and development of programs for&#13;
maintenance improvements. In addition, the project would finance (under provisions&#13;
separate from this Terms of Reference) development of and training in the&#13;
computerization of USAG's billing and collection system for metered supplies.&#13;
18.   MUB wish to appoint a suitably qualified international firm to act as Project&#13;
Implementation and Management Consultant ("the Consultant") to assist the PMU and&#13;
the implementing agencies with implementation management.&#13;
19.  In view of the substantial number of contracts to be let under the Project, the need&#13;
to prepare designs and bid documents for the second through fifth years of the project,&#13;
and MUB's very limited experience in managing an IDA-financed project, MUB wishes&#13;
to develop standardized procedures for the review of detailed designs, specifications and&#13;
bills of quantities, the prequalification of contractors, preparation of contract&#13;
documentation, the evaluation and award of contracts and to establish an appropriate&#13;
system to manage and monitor project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
20.   The Consultant will assist MUB to:&#13;
(a)   review detailed designs and technical specifications, where necessary, for&#13;
all project components;&#13;
(b)   prepare ICB and NCB bid documents, satisfactory to MUB and IDA on&#13;
the basis of the model documents prepared for first-year projects during&#13;
project preparation;&#13;
(c)   prequalify and postqualify bidders and identify potential suppliers;&#13;
(d)   establish standard tendering and bid evaluation procedures to conform to&#13;
IDA procurement guidelines and principles;&#13;
(e)   establish contract implementation, procurement and engineering quality&#13;
control criteria and procedures for monitoring; and&#13;
(f)   implement a construction and equipment installation management system&#13;
for civil works and equipment-particularly with regard to the meter&#13;
installation and fixture repair and replacement programs.&#13;
21.   Bid Documents. During finalization of bid documents, the Consultant will&#13;
review engineering designs, specifications and other relevant documentation to ensure&#13;
that they conform to good design practice and to IDA guidelines and particularly that cold&#13;
climate technical requirements are being adequately met. Bid documents will be subject&#13;
to review by IDA.&#13;
22.   Review of Technical Specifications.  Standard technical specifications are&#13;
available for many items, but there will be cases where modifications or additions may be&#13;
appropriate. Where necessary, the consultant will assist MUB to draft revisions or&#13;
additions for inclusion in the relevant bid documents.&#13;
23.   Pre- and  Postqualification.   Where contractor prequalification  and/or&#13;
postqualification is required, the Consultant will assist MUB to advertise for potential&#13;
contractors to prequalify, to evaluate prequalification and postqualification submissions&#13;
and to establish shortlists for bidding.&#13;
24.   Tendering and Bid Evaluation. The Consultant will assist MUB to establish&#13;
and administer standard procedures for competitive bidding and award in accordance with&#13;
IDA Guidelines and project agreements in relation to International and National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB and NCB) and for International and National Shopping. The&#13;
Consultant will advise on relevant international and local suppliers where appropriate.&#13;
25.   Quality Control. MUB and IDA wish to ensure that civil works and equipment&#13;
installations implemented under the Project are of a high standard and will therefore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
require guidance from the Consultant in establishing appropriate quality monitoring and&#13;
reporting procedures.&#13;
26.   Construction Management System. The Consultant will assist the Municipality&#13;
to establish an information system to manage contracts and monitor implementation&#13;
progress, including monitoring expenditure and time required for contract(s)&#13;
implementation, payments to contractors and applications for withdrawal of IDA funds.&#13;
The system should be designed to identify problems at an early stage and to provide&#13;
project progress information for the MUB and the IDA at regular intervals.&#13;
27.   Institutional. The Consultant will assist MUB to prepare periodic progress&#13;
reports for Government and IDA, consolidating the progress on project components&#13;
implemented by MUB and USAG. The consultant will also assist MUB to monitor&#13;
compliance with the Credit Covenants, Project Action Plans, provisions for audits and&#13;
accounts, and financial and other project performance targets.&#13;
28.   In-City Training Seminars. The Consultant will conduct at least one in-city&#13;
training seminar in the city during the period of the consultancy contract. These seminars&#13;
would be expected to extend over a period of about 15 days and would be attended by&#13;
selected personnel from the city. The seminars would address topics of relevance to the&#13;
city, including specification and design, prequalification, bidding, evaluation and award&#13;
of contracts, contract management and supervision, quality control, saLety procedures,&#13;
operations and maintenance. Additionally, the Consultant would address topics of&#13;
specific relevance such as cold climate utilities design and construction.&#13;
Consultant Team&#13;
29.   The consultant will be expected to provide intermittent technical assistance to&#13;
MUB over a period of two to three years commencing, if possible, late 1997. During the&#13;
initial stages, frequent advice is likely to be needed. Subsequently, once standard&#13;
procedures and working methods have been established, the need for technical advice and&#13;
the frequency of visits will reduce.&#13;
30.  In view of the need for frequent, short visits, the Consultant may wish to work&#13;
from a regional office within Mongolia or China, which is near Outer Mongolia. In any&#13;
event, the Consultant should arrange good communication facilities between their office,&#13;
the Municipality and IDA in Washington.&#13;
31.   The Consultant will provide about 32 person-months of professional staff input,&#13;
approximately 18 months in year 1, 10 months in years 2, and 4 months in year 3, and&#13;
will appoint a Senior Project Management Advisor/Team Leader as prime representative&#13;
(table annexed). The Team Leader will be a senior Municipal services engineer, with&#13;
substantial water and sewerage experience, having appropriate regional experience and&#13;
familiarity with IDA procedures and procurement guidelines.&#13;

C. MAINTENANCE DEVELOPMENT OF USAGE-TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
40.   The Government of Mongolia has applied to the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) for a Credit amounting to $16.1 million which is to be onlent to the&#13;
Water and Wastewater Company USAG in Ulaanbaatar to support program of&#13;
investments to improve and expand its water and wastewater services. An equally&#13;
important part of the project is an institutional development of USAG including&#13;
maintenance improvement component. For this purpose a technical assistance of a&#13;
specialist-consultant is to be provided to help USAG in developing and implementing a&#13;
proper maintenance techniques and procedures.&#13;
41.   Under 1991 Public Enterprise Law, USAG as hitherto existing a municipality arm&#13;
is predicted to be converted into a limited liability company with the Municipality of UB&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
as the Owner. With such given autonomy, USAG is expected to operate more efficiently&#13;
during and after implementation of the institutional strengthening program.&#13;
42.   USAG operates a water supply system that currently includes 300 km of water&#13;
pipelines and well fields of some 110 wells and pump stations, while the sewerage system&#13;
has an 80 km network that feeds into a wastewater treatment plant before discharge. In&#13;
addition, USAG provides water supply for the ger areas through 262 public water kiosks,&#13;
receiving water from a fleet of about 50 water tanker trucks.&#13;
43.   Due to the insufficient tariff increases authorized by the Municipality in the past,&#13;
USAG has lacked adequate revenue to carry out system maintenance. It currently has no&#13;
regular maintenance procedures, and maintenance is usually performed only when&#13;
absolutely necessary. Now, with the revenues expected from a substantial tariff increase&#13;
in October 1996, the budged for maintenance will be increased by 10 percent annually in&#13;
real terms and should become available for a much stepped-up maintenance program.&#13;
According to this budget agreed with IDA and kept over the project years 1998-2001, all&#13;
maintenance expenditure shall be covered.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
44.   The main objective of this consultant assignment is to assist USAG in planning,&#13;
designing and introducing more efficient maintenance procedures to enhance USAG&#13;
capability and efficiency, to improve quality of provided services, and to maintain the&#13;
value of its own assets. The TA will be accompanied by training of USAG staff.&#13;
Scope of Works&#13;
45.   Assessment of Existing Situation. As a basis for any decision making, a good&#13;
understanding of the present condition of the water and sewage network, treatment&#13;
stations, reservoirs, buildings and other tangible assets is essential. Therefore, the&#13;
program should begin with the survey of physical condition of those facilities and the&#13;
record of their life (repairing, replacement, modernization). Available information,&#13;
including maps, damages record and statistics, a kind of material and an age of pipelines&#13;
will be very useful.&#13;
46.   As a second step, the review of the current maintenance procedures, including&#13;
planning, reporting, execution, technical quality standards, status of spare parts and a&#13;
survey of the existing maintenance equipment, should be done.&#13;
47.  In carrying out these assessments, a thorough analysis of the information already&#13;
available to USAG should be done. Further field examinations, analysis and presentation&#13;
of information would be carried out in accordance with a plan of action agreed with&#13;
USAG.&#13;
48.   Elaboration of Prioritized Maintenance Plan. Information gained during the&#13;
preliminary assessment (noted in above paragraphs) will be used to identify and analyze&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
investment interventions needed as a priority. This will involve the list of actions&#13;
including repairing or replacement of facilities and renewing buildings. Special emphasis&#13;
should be given to the identification of win-win solution. For instance, the replacement&#13;
of existing pumps with more energy efficient ones, or the replacement of old corroded&#13;
pipes may reduce water contamination and water leakage.  The prepared list of&#13;
maintenance investment should be ranked in accordance with definition of priorities.&#13;
49.   Preparation of Detailed Annual Maintenance Plans.  Based on prepared&#13;
prioritized maintenance plan described above, the Consultant should assist USAG in&#13;
preparing specific annual maintenance plans based on available budget, which has to be&#13;
submitted to the Governing Board by October 15 of each year, except for 1998 when it&#13;
would be by March 15, 1998. The first year plan may need to focus on simple tasks&#13;
enhancing the work enviromnent.&#13;
50.   Developing Suitable Maintenance Procedures. The Consultant shall assist&#13;
USAG in developing a routine maintenance procedure based on:&#13;
* analysis of age, depreciation value and technical quality standard of existing&#13;
facilities (network, buildings, equipment)&#13;
a analysis of past record of damages and its statistic&#13;
* cost estimation of maintenance activity including investment&#13;
51.   After finishing the TA program provided by the Consultant, USAG staff should&#13;
be able to manage the routine maintenance procedure including the following tasks:&#13;
n preparation of annual maintenance plans, including ranking in accordance with&#13;
definition of priorities and pricing with using software tools&#13;
* operating with advance maintenance equipment for leakage detection, water&#13;
meters calibration and installation, sewer cleaning equipment operation&#13;
* planning water network areas designated for day to day investigation due to&#13;
water leakage prevention&#13;
* preparation bidding procedures for goods purchasing&#13;
* preparing and defining inventory listing for store of spares&#13;
* preparing reports on day-to-day maintenance&#13;
52.   Implementation Assistance.  The Consultant will assist USAG  in the&#13;
implementation of the up-to-date maintenance techniques including:&#13;
* implementation of high quality standard materials, fittings and devices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
* implementation of modern repairing technologies&#13;
* implementation of advance method of daily routine maintenance activities&#13;
(water leakage detection)&#13;
The "Coaching" Role of the Consultant&#13;
53.   The main role of the Consultant will be to provide organization, know how&#13;
guidance and general facilitation of maintenance work is done day-to-day by USAG staff.&#13;
All Maintenance Department staff subordinated to the Chief Engineer are expected to be&#13;
fiully involved for successful final result of this job training. A contract agreement for the&#13;
consultant services should carefully define counterpart input and involvement in to this&#13;
project for assuring its prospective expected benefits.&#13;
54.   The Consultant may also assist in defining and acquiring special equipment (pipe&#13;
locators, plugs for closing off sewers, sewer cleaning equipment , meter calibration&#13;
equipment ) to be paid under IDA funding.&#13;
Qualification of the Consultant&#13;
55.   The Consultant should be experienced in maintenance procedure and asset&#13;
management and should fulfill the following conditions:&#13;
* work in a Public Utility for at least 10 years ( a recently retired person would&#13;
be acceptable);&#13;
&#149; experience in maintenance workshop;&#13;
* education: technician or engineer; and&#13;
* Russian language would be a definite plus.&#13;
Timing and Budget&#13;
56.   The TA will require the services of a Consultant with a total of 9 man-months of&#13;
foreign consultant  input.  Total budget is estimated to be $150,000 including&#13;
contingencies for a study tour to a public utility for three people of the maintenance&#13;
department. It is expected, that whole training program and implementation assistance&#13;
will start since January 1998 and will be finished in December 2000. The detailed&#13;
program will be agreed with USAG after completion of the phase on the existing&#13;
situation phase.&#13;
Schedule and Reporting&#13;
57.   The technical assistance is to be provided under this TOR during a period of 3&#13;
years. Inputs are expected to be heavier at the beginning of the assignment, tapering off&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
as the USAG maintenance department staff takes over the responsibility for preparing and&#13;
implementing yearly maintenance schedules.&#13;
58.   The Consultant will submit brief reports after each visits in USAG according to&#13;
his agreed schedule of work. Reports prepared in the English language will summarize:&#13;
(a) progress achieved; (b) difficulties encountered; (c) action expected by USAG services;&#13;
and (d) issues to be resolved. Six copies of each report (prepared in Mongolian by the&#13;
PMU) will be dispatched to USAG (4 copies to the General Manager and his Deputies,&#13;
two to the members of the Board) and two copies (in English) to IDA in Washington.&#13;
Materials, Data and Support Services&#13;
59.   The Consultant, when providing technical assistance, will work in the offices of&#13;
the USAG Maintenance Departments and will be provided with sufficient furnished&#13;
office accommodation at no cost to the Consultant. USAG commits itself to provide all&#13;
necessary and available data at no cost to the Consultant.&#13;
60.   Computers and related office equipment, software and vehicles, which are already&#13;
available in the PMU office, would be also made available to the Consultant.&#13;
61.   The PMU will provide appropriate support staff to work with the Consultant&#13;
(especially interpreters), and will arrange introductions to other agencies if required.&#13;
62.   Under the Contract Agreement for consultant services, the Consultant's&#13;
remuneration will cover all payment costs plus all costs in connection with international&#13;
travel, accommodation and subsistence.&#13;
63.   The Consultant will be reimbursed, at cost, for any expenses reasonably incurred&#13;
in connection with telecommunications, courier services and printing, and local travel&#13;
related to the provision of these consultancy services.&#13;
D. AN URBAN MANAGEMENT AND GER/CITY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND&#13;
STRATEGY STUDY-TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
64.   The current Master Plan was prepared in 1986, before the massive changes in&#13;
Mongolia's political and economic situation forced the curtailment of the apartment&#13;
building program. In the longer run, the inefficient, current Ger layout in long lanes and&#13;
large (400-700 m 2) plots, without reservations for community open space and facilities,&#13;
or a functional road hierarchy, will need to be redeveloped or reshaped, at least in some&#13;
areas.&#13;
65.   The Master Plan needs to be revised to incorporate the current situation, in which&#13;
the majority of the Ger areas are likely to develop into permanent residential areas. The&#13;
form of tenure to be provided to Ger residents under the ongoing (in 1997) program to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
privatize housing and land should take into account future needs to restructure the&#13;
infrastructure, reassemble or redefine the allowed land use on a plot or plots in a more&#13;
efficient configuration, which will also be sensitive to constraints on the availability of&#13;
funds for infrastructure investments and the affordability of services and plots to existing&#13;
and future ger residents, particularly in low-income groups.&#13;
66.   The apartment housing estates are clustered near the city center or along the main&#13;
roads of UB and are relatively well-served by public transport-the favored mode up to&#13;
1990. (Private car use and ownership has been growing rapidly since then.) The&#13;
apartment units have individual cold and hot water, toilets and bathrooms, conventional&#13;
piped sewage collection, on-site and off-site underground, piped stormwater drainage,&#13;
electricity and hot water heating and lifts in higher buildings. USAG provides the cold&#13;
water for hot and cold water supply in apartments. The hot water is generated in CTPs in&#13;
the housing sites. Heating hot water and electricity for the apartments (and institutional&#13;
buildings) are generated in central city plants serving the whole city. Apartment rents&#13;
and utility charges have until recently been heavily subsidized.&#13;
67.   Due to economic and political changes following the withdrawal of the FSU,&#13;
apartment building in the public sector has practically ceased and the small amount of&#13;
private construction is focused on higher-income housing. UB's housing future for the&#13;
majority of the population appears to lie in Ger area development.&#13;
68.   The existing Ger area are mostly on the outlying hills and valleys to the north,&#13;
northwest and northeast of UB and 2-12 kilometers from UB's economic activity.&#13;
69.   Families interested in obtaining a Ger plot apply to local Khoroo offices (city&#13;
subdistricts, the smallest unit of city administration). Plots of 300-500 m are located and&#13;
staked out by a city surveyor. Most new residents obtain plots this way, although there is&#13;
an increasingly active city real estate market. Only 10 percent of the plots are estimated&#13;
to be occupied by unregistered settlers.&#13;
70.   As all land was owned by government and the semidesert land is open,&#13;
uncultivated, though hilly and sometimes deeply-ravined, it is amenable to rapid Ger&#13;
development with few legal or natural constraints-except for water supply and possibly&#13;
heating fuel.&#13;
71.   Ger are laid out in simple, relatively long and narrow, rectilinear plots with long,&#13;
wide public rights-of-way between rows of plots. Plot-holders construct wooden fences&#13;
around their plots and have constructed a mixture of Ger (a circular, demountable wooden&#13;
tent with a felt and canvas cover), wooden frame and masonry structures. Because of&#13;
large plot sizes and the configuration of the infrastructure, Ger densities of 110/ha (with&#13;
extremes of 45 and 200 in the selected areas) are quite low. On the other hand, the&#13;
existing layouts lack provisions for cornmunity services and a structure that is amenable&#13;
to cost-effective, affordable and higher-density future development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97-                       ANNEX6&#13;
72.   Thus, a Study is needed of the financial, planning, land use and management tools&#13;
and costs and a strategy for Ger redevelopment/reshaping in an efficient, manageable,&#13;
equitable and affordable manner-an Urban Management And Ger/City Development&#13;
Planning and Strategy Study.&#13;
Urban Planning and Management Issues&#13;
73.   The key issues to be addressed in the Study, which would be with particular&#13;
reference to Ger areas in Ulaanbaatar City, and which are within the Scope of Work of&#13;
this Study are discussed below.&#13;
74.   Guidance Regarding Ger/City Redevelopment/Reshaping and Expansion.&#13;
The issues to be addressed in the Study, are:&#13;
(a)   the costs and benefits to households and the city of densification versus&#13;
expansion to meet city development and growth requirements;&#13;
(b)   the direction(s) of growth and location of services with regard to natural&#13;
constraints and sensitivities (e.g., permafrost, aquifers, water pressure) and&#13;
realistic availability of financial resources for service investments,&#13;
operations and maintenance;&#13;
(c)   open space/recreation requirements and the affordability of housing and&#13;
settlements, particularly to lower-income households; and&#13;
(d)   practical and effective instruments to guide growth, including assessment&#13;
of government's capacity and instruments for guiding/regulating land use&#13;
and development and managing the location, standards and costs of roads,&#13;
water supply, electricity supply, industrial estates, markets, transport and&#13;
other infrastructure.&#13;
75.   Management and Provisions for City Services (not covered adequately by other&#13;
contemporary studies, such as water supply and distribution). These would include&#13;
analysis and recommendations regarding:&#13;
(a)   transport infrastructure (railroads, roads, bridges, foot/cycle paths;)&#13;
(b)   transport modes (train, tram, bus, paratransit, auto, cycle, walk);&#13;
(c)   drainage;&#13;
(d)   sanitation;&#13;
(e)   health and education services; and&#13;
(f)   community and recreation services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-98 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
76.   Institutional  Requirements.    These  would  include  analysis  and&#13;
recommendations regarding:&#13;
(a)   responsibilities for services (central/local government, pubic or private&#13;
sector);&#13;
(b)   legal and regulatory environment for managing land development and&#13;
urban services;&#13;
(c)   intersectoral coordination, planning and budgeting;&#13;
(d)   performance monitoring and public disclosure; and&#13;
(e)   stakeholder participation in planning and management&#13;
77.   The System and Base for Financing Urban Services. This would include&#13;
analysis and recommendations regarding:&#13;
(a)   central, local government and private responsibilities for investment and&#13;
operations and maintenance of specific urban services;&#13;
(b)   expenditure requirements and revenue base for specific services;&#13;
(c)   municipal tax and revenue base and potential for expanding the tax base&#13;
from, inter alia, businesses, entertainment and property development and&#13;
sales transactions (real estate);&#13;
(d)   central government grants and loans system for local services; and&#13;
(e)   municipal accounting and financial management.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
78.   The objectives of the Study, with special reference to new and existing ger and&#13;
development areas are:&#13;
(a)   to develop physical, institutional and financial strategies and mechanisms&#13;
to guide UB's future development, particularly in existing and new Ger&#13;
areas, with a view to the affordability of land to lower-income groups;&#13;
(b)   to strengthen the capabilities of UB's municipality, community and private&#13;
sectors to plan and manage the city on an ongoing basis.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
79.   The scope of work would be organized under three heads:&#13;
(a)   Growth Strategy and Services Planning;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99 -                       ANNEX6&#13;
(b)   Legal and Institutional Strengthening; and&#13;
(c)   Financial Management Planning.&#13;
80.   The Study will be largely based on existing information/data, much of which is&#13;
available from project feasibility and engineering studies, during Phases 1 and 2, for the&#13;
USIP. "Urban services" for the purpose of the Study refers to all infrastructure and&#13;
equipment in UB, including railroads, roads and bridges, foot/cycle paths, drainage,&#13;
sewerage, sanitation, water supply and solid waste management, excluding detailed&#13;
analyses of gas, coal and electricity, which are provided by parastatal or companies.&#13;
Social services to be included in the Study are: health, education, community facilities,&#13;
recreation, police and fire services and government.&#13;
81.   Where appropriate, the Study will distinguish between: (a) investment in physical&#13;
facilities; (b) their operation and maintenance costs (O&amp;M); (c) investment and operating&#13;
costs of social services and solid waste management; and (d) administration of&#13;
government. MUB considers that analysis of water supply and solid waste will not need&#13;
to be undertaken under the Study since these sectors have been analyzed during the&#13;
preparation of the USIP. However, related policies, plans and financing arrangements for&#13;
these sectors should be included in the Study's strategic plan and the Study's institutional&#13;
and financial proposals.&#13;
82.   The scope of work would be organized under three heads, with their associated&#13;
tasks, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Growth Strategy and Services Planning. This Study activity would&#13;
involve:&#13;
(i)   analyzing the economic and demographic base and trends in the&#13;
UB region in yearly increments over the next 20 years;&#13;
(ii)    preparing prototype layouts of existing and proposed new Ger&#13;
areas including social, health, education and local commercial&#13;
facilities, with alternative levels of service for access (roads and&#13;
footpaths, water supply and sanitation and alternative plot sizes&#13;
(the latter to take into account differences in densities related to&#13;
location) and assessing the affordability of plots to households in&#13;
various income groups, using realistic assumptions about the cost&#13;
and availability of capital and credit and permissible/recommended&#13;
provisions for land use.&#13;
(iii)   estimating of costs of the alternatives and cost per plot and per&#13;
family, excluding costs of social, educational and commercial&#13;
areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100 -                        ANNEX6&#13;
(iv)    estimating  family  affordability to purchase plots/housing  at&#13;
alternative densities developed from the cost estimates (above);&#13;
(v)    estimating (order of magnitude) of land requirements and major&#13;
public infrastructure requirements and major commercial,&#13;
industrial and transport land requirements and their cost, using&#13;
population growth rates and alternative settlement densities&#13;
prepared above (e.g., for roads, sewerage, water supply and&#13;
drainage)-for five-year intervals over 20 years, separating&#13;
requirements to meet the backlog of services from requirements to&#13;
meet new growth;&#13;
(vi)    analyzing natural environmental systems and resources of the UB&#13;
region, identification of highly sensitive areas where development&#13;
should be excluded, and classification of remaining land types&#13;
according to their suitability for ger/future housing development in&#13;
different land uses;&#13;
(vii)   identifying existing ambient water and air quality levels, major&#13;
existing sources of water and air pollution and solid and toxic&#13;
waste sources, estimation of expected increases in pollution levels&#13;
due to the recommended development strategy and measures&#13;
required to curb pollution from major sources;&#13;
(viii)   identifying funds expected to be available for capital investment in&#13;
infrastructure (from central government grants, local government's&#13;
own revenues including revenues generated by its service agencies,&#13;
loans, external grants and private capital in yearly increments over&#13;
the next 10 years;&#13;
(ix)    matching costs of alternative development densities, infrastructure&#13;
standards and costs, for local area and macro infrastructure,&#13;
projected growth rates and environmental constraints (above) with&#13;
estimated affordable financing available to households (above) and&#13;
the public and private sectors, to prepare policies on:&#13;
*  densities, service levels and spatial layouts, regulations to plot&#13;
subdivision for Ger development to respond to private and&#13;
market influences;&#13;
*  potential for area housing  development, apartments and&#13;
commercial development by the formal sector in existing and&#13;
proposed future ger areas;&#13;
*  design and performance standards and service levels for macro&#13;
and micro infrastructure;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                       ANNEX6&#13;
(x)    selecting best alternative options for development on the basis of&#13;
discussions and workshops with other Working Groups and&#13;
Steering Committee using the above analysis;&#13;
(xi)   preparing (from above) a schematic structure plan for the UB&#13;
region to include a map indicating:&#13;
* timing, investment and broad locations for upgrading/reshaping&#13;
existing Ger areas and provision of new housing development&#13;
areas, commercial areas and markets;&#13;
* location and phasing of land release and development for ger&#13;
areas and where necessary, for the expanding city, together&#13;
with key markets, and transport terminals (so as to minimize&#13;
journey to work and dangers of pollution and accidents);&#13;
* an open space strategy to link with the environmental analysis&#13;
of  suitable  areas,  and  the  population's  recreational&#13;
requirements;&#13;
(xii)   preparing key policy statements on:&#13;
* overall development policy and spatial policy;&#13;
* Ger development and role of local communities in&#13;
development planning;&#13;
- infrastructure service levels and standards;&#13;
* transport;&#13;
* social, health and educational facility standards; and&#13;
*  environmental quality and pollution control;&#13;
(xiii)   recommending a high-priority set of policy actions and public and&#13;
private investments for short-term immediate implementation and&#13;
any studies required to analyze areas of uncertainty or gather key&#13;
information required to make decisions.&#13;
(b)   Legal and Institutional Strengthening.  This Study activity would&#13;
involve:&#13;
(i)   analyzing and make recommendations regarding functions and&#13;
responsibilities of agencies and institutions operating in the urban&#13;
sector at the central and local government level and community&#13;
and private sector levels, which undertake policy formation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102 -                     ANNEX6&#13;

implementation of services and management of land;&#13;
(ii)   identifying outputs of the above agencies and their staffing&#13;
structure and assessing their strengths and adequacy for their tasks;&#13;
(iii)   identifying strengths, shortfalls, duplications, mismatches and&#13;
weak coordination between agencies;&#13;
(iv)   identifying underlying reasons for strengths and weaknesses in&#13;
regulation, planning, management of urban services by the public&#13;
sector agencies, with particular focus on poor definition of&#13;
responsibilities,  inappropriate  staff  skills,  weak  career&#13;
opportunities, low remuneration and any other disincentives&#13;
affecting action and interpersonal/interagency cooperation;&#13;
(v)    briefly assessing management and implementation capacity of the&#13;
private sector for investment in and delivery of urban services and&#13;
identifying its potential for private sector to undertake&#13;
responsibility for implementation and management of some&#13;
services; also identifying areas in this topic that may need further&#13;
study;&#13;
(vi)   from the above analysis and in the light of the projected demands&#13;
for urban services, and information/analysis of urban finance&#13;
potential, recommending legal, institutional and organizational&#13;
changes necessary to implement and manage the regulation,&#13;
planning, financing implementation and management of urban land&#13;
and services; and inasmuch as Ger areas may be planned and&#13;
developed at the micro level by their residents and Khoroo and&#13;
Duuregs, recommending any improvements and initiatives needed&#13;
by government to coordinate the outreach and assistance to Ger&#13;
residents and organize community participation (including NGO&#13;
involvement) in planning and implementation of Ger land,&#13;
services, social facilities and income generation opportunities;&#13;
(vii)   recommending measures necessary to create an institutional&#13;
structure and incentives among government agencies and the&#13;
Community to continue coordinating the planning, programming,&#13;
budgeting and monitoring of development changes. Identifying&#13;
instruments necessary to achieve this purpose (e.g., GIS mapping,&#13;
multiyear intersectoral budgeting, etc.) and assessing and&#13;
recommending the practicality of their application in Mongolia.&#13;
(c)   Financial Management Planning. This Study activity would involve the&#13;
preparation of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
(i)   analyzing revenue by source, for central and local government&#13;
(separately for loans and grants) and including funds from external&#13;
(international) sources; estimation of amounts raised by specific&#13;
instruments (taxes, user charges, profit from government&#13;
enterprises, etc.); reviewing revenue levels over each of past five&#13;
years; and identifying any revenues tied to expenditures or specific&#13;
services or infrastructures;&#13;
(ii)   projecting revenues by source and year over the next five years,&#13;
under a do-nothing scenario, but including any recent changes in&#13;
revenue sources (e.g., sale of land leases through land privatization&#13;
program), or major Study proposals for changing or adding&#13;
specific sources of revenue;&#13;
(iii)   analyzing expenditures by year over past five years by:&#13;
* Central Government through Central implementing agencies to&#13;
specific services in UB and subsidies to urban services&#13;
corporations/companies;&#13;
*  Central Government to local government through block grants&#13;
and tied to specific services but both implemented by local&#13;
government;&#13;
* by grants and/or loans from external (international and bilateral&#13;
agencies) for services in UB.&#13;
(iv)   recommending from which sources, in what amounts and on what&#13;
potential terms and conditions (user charges, taxes, fees, bonds,&#13;
etc.) and by whom various services could be provided-e.g.,&#13;
Central Government, MUB, households, the private sector&#13;
(Developers), international agencies, banks and so on to fund the&#13;
recommended high-priority set of policy actions and investments&#13;
for short-term immediate implementation, produced under sections&#13;
above.&#13;
Study Organization&#13;
83.   The Study would be guided by a Steering Committee, whose Chairman would be&#13;
the MUB City Manager, and whose Member Secretary would be MUB's Chief of the&#13;
Department Of Strategic Policy And Planning. The rest of the Steering Committee would&#13;
be composed of senior officials from appropriate Departments of MUB and Central&#13;
Government and representatives from academic, public interest and private sector groups.&#13;
84.   The Study itself would be undertaken by three Working Groups for:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
(a)   Growth Strategy and Services Planning;&#13;
(b)   Legal and Institutional Strengthening; and&#13;
(c)   Financial Management Planning.&#13;
85.   The work on the Study of the three Working Groups is interdependent in time,&#13;
substance and analysis and each Group will have to provide timely inputs and outputs to&#13;
the other. Accordingly, their activities will have to be coordinated and integrated in time&#13;
and in regard to substance within a Study implementation Schedule. The responsibility&#13;
for coordinating working group activities, inputs and outputs would rest with the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) for the UB Urban Services Project.&#13;
86.   The PMU's USIP Project Manager, or alternatively a Study Manager/Coordinator&#13;
(PMC), drawn from the private sector, nominated by the Chairman of the Steering&#13;
Committee and endorsed by the rest of the Steering Committee, would coordinate and&#13;
manage the Study within the PIU for USIP. If the Study PMC is recruited from the&#13;
private sector, his/her costs would be covered by USIP technical assistance funds.&#13;
87.   The Working Groups' members would be professional staff drawn on deputation&#13;
from relevant MUB and Central Government Ministries and Departments and from&#13;
Community, and private sector groups with interests in the Study.&#13;
88.   All Working Group MUB and Central Government members would be deputized&#13;
full-time to the Working Groups and would be paid by Government through normal&#13;
channels. Community and private sector representatives would participate at their own&#13;
cost.&#13;
89.   The PMU and Study Working Groups would be assisted in the management,&#13;
analysis and organization of the Study by International Consultants, from whom MUB&#13;
seeks proposals under these Terms of Reference. The PMU and Study Working Groups&#13;
would also be assisted in the management, analysis and organization of the Study by&#13;
Local Consultants wno would be separately funded by USIP. The PMU would identify&#13;
the Local Consultants and the Study PMC if recruited from the private sector. The&#13;
appointment by the PMC of Local Consultants and the PMC to undertake the Study,&#13;
would be subject to review and approval by: (a) IDA; and (b) the International&#13;
Consultants.&#13;
90.   The Consultants will be expected to provide technical assistance to MUB/PMU&#13;
and its Study Working Groups over a period of six months commencing, if possible, in&#13;
early 1998. During the opening period of the Study, substantial advice/guidance is likely&#13;
to be needed, particuiarly regarding study methodologies and their implementation.&#13;
Subsequently, once procedures, working methods, the Working Groups and the Local&#13;
Consultants have been established the need for technical advice and the intensity of&#13;
International Consultants' assistance may reduce somewhat in the middle stage of the&#13;
Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
91.   The Consultant will provide about 7 person-months of professional staff input&#13;
over the six-month Study period, and will appoint a Study Leader as their prime&#13;
representative (table annexed). The Team Leader will be a senior urban planner, with&#13;
substantial experience in planning and management of urban services and finance, and-&#13;
if possible-having appropriate regional experience.&#13;

ANNEX 8: SCHEDULE OF PROCUREMENT PACKAGES&#13;
1.    Project preparation has reached detailed design for the physical components of&#13;
water supply and ger upgrading. The Project Preparation Unit issued a table listing all&#13;
proposed packages for each year, which was discussed during the appraisal mission and&#13;
agreed. It was also agreed as part of the Sector Action Plan that the Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU) would submit an updated procurement plan each October for every year after&#13;
Year 1 implementation. The revised table is based on the following constraints: the&#13;
limited period of the six-month growing season followed by harsh winter and freezing&#13;
conditions that hamper civil works to be carried out over winter; and the implementation&#13;
capacity of the local construction industry.  Both factors are good incentives for&#13;
developing bidding plans along yearly schedules with the requirements that bids need to&#13;
be distributed in the month of December preceding the year of implementation, and&#13;
approved at the latest the next March to enable contractors to proceed as soon as frost&#13;
conditions allow  excavation and construction activities.  Bidding documentation,&#13;
definition of packages and type of procurement have been comprehensively discussed&#13;
with the Project Unit and Municipality officials for the first year of implementation. All&#13;
procurement of equipment for amount over $100,000 would be carried out by ICB. All&#13;
procurement for civil works above $500,000 would be carried out according to ICB using&#13;
sample bid documents. Civil works for lesser amounts would be carried out on an NCB&#13;
basis using bidding documentation developed on the basis of the Sample Bid Document&#13;
for smaller works and prepared in the Mongolian language. All bid documents for the&#13;
first year of implementation will receive a-priori review, to ensure their adequacy of their&#13;
technical, commercial and general specifications. Packages and modes of procurement&#13;
for subsequent yearly work programs would proceed on the same basis as the schedule of&#13;
the first year of implementation.&#13;
2.    The metering and fixture repair programs would have the equipment packaged in&#13;
three parts and procured by the PMU on behalf of USAG during the first three years.&#13;
Under the metering package, the supplier would be asked to provide technical assistance&#13;
to help the kantors implement installation of meters according to best practices; and to&#13;
provide the software billing and collection systems.  Installation of meters and&#13;
replacement of fixtures would also be would be carried out by the kantors. Likewise, the&#13;
repair of fixtures would also be carried out by the kantors' labor force.&#13;
3.    Year-I and 2 Bid Packages. The table below gives a tentative breakdown of the&#13;
various goods and works into bid packages for the first two years and a tentative&#13;
breakdown of the program for subsequent years.&#13;

-121-                      ANNEX 12&#13;
ANNEX 12: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF ULAANBAATAR&#13;
MUNICIPALITY&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
1.    Ulaanbaatar, with more than 25 percent of Mongolia's total population, had an&#13;
operating budget of Tug 23.9 billion in 1995, equivalent to 18 percent of the national&#13;
budget of Tug 131.3 billion. Due to the economic upheaval of the early 1990s, the&#13;
budget of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) shrank dramatically in 1992 and then&#13;
stabilized in real terms ever since then as did its size relative to the national budget. The&#13;
MUB budget is divided into the current budget for operating expenditures and the capital&#13;
budget for new investments. MUB has no outstanding debts and its revenues have grown&#13;
in line with inflation since 1992. The expected introduction of a property tax on the&#13;
recently privatized apartments and MUB's policy of increasing tariffs for urban services&#13;
to recover operating costs will help further consolidate its finances.&#13;
2.    The proposed IDA credit will be directly onlent from the central government to&#13;
USAG. MUB, however, agreed to provide $1.26 million as counterpart funding and had&#13;
already earmarked Tug 200 million in the 1997 budget as part of the project's counterpart&#13;
funding to carry out the construction of two connecting pipelines to support the project.&#13;
The project will not create any excessive burden on MUB as IDA's credit will be paid&#13;
back by the expected revenues of USAG.&#13;
3.    The AusAID grant of $5 million will be passed on to the municipality. The&#13;
investments supported by AusAID for the next five years amounts to 50 percent of&#13;
MUB's 1996 capital budget and will substantially help relieve the burden of municipal&#13;
finance. The AusAID component will relieve some of MUB's financial burden for ger&#13;
investments by introducing the concept of cost recovery and establishing a Ger&#13;
Infrastructure Development Fund.&#13;
PAST PERFORMANCE&#13;
4.    The operating budget accounts for around 75 percent of the total budget. Taxes&#13;
are the major source of operating budget, accounting for around 80 percent. The business&#13;
income tax is the largest source but with declining shares at over 40 percent currently,&#13;
followed by the trade tax and personal income tax with 14 and 12 percent, respectively.&#13;
On the expenditure side, the personnel cost, including a social security contribution, is the&#13;
largest cost, with its share increasing from 30 percent in 1994 to 48 percent in 1996. By&#13;
sector, education and health accounts for 80 percent of total expenditure. Except in 1995,&#13;
the operating budget has recorded small annual surpluses, which were used as a source&#13;
for the capital budget in the following year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122 -                     ANNEX 12&#13;
5.    The capital budget as a proportion of the operating budget was as high as 50&#13;
percent in 1991 when subsidies from the central government were large. Since then, its&#13;
size relative to the operating budget has been stable at around 25 percent. Its source&#13;
includes the carryover surplus from the current budget, and revenues from special funds&#13;
such as the housing sales fund, road fund, and fixed asset sales and leases. An additional&#13;
source is the subsidy from the central government. One major source of the central&#13;
government subsidy, the apartment construction fund provided by Russian aid, dropped&#13;
dramatically in 1992 and was discontinued from 1994.&#13;
6.   In constant terms, both the current and capital budgets shrank substantially in&#13;
1992, mainly due to an exchange rate adjustment and hyperinflation that began in 1991.&#13;
The consequent reduction was more dramatic in the capital budget, which dropped to 14&#13;
percent in 1992 from the previous year in constant terms. As MUB did not adjust its&#13;
urban services fees to catch up with inflation, it scaled down its operation and&#13;
maintenance as well as new investments. This also brought about gradual deterioration of&#13;
the quality of urban services. Even with these adjustments, however, many urban&#13;
operations such as transportation, solid waste, and housing services resulted in losses,&#13;
which were subsequently covered by subsidies from the central government. Realizing&#13;
that this practice is not sustainable and results in waste and inefficiencies, the government&#13;
allowed tariff increases to cover the operating cost of services from 1994.&#13;
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
7.    Currently, MUB does not prepare a detailed medium-term budget projection. It&#13;
hopes that it can meet the increasing demand for better urban services by various&#13;
initiatives. It will continue to push for tariff increases for various urban services to&#13;
recover the cost of services. It is also endeavoring to increase efficiency of service&#13;
delivery by introducing competition and privatization where warranted.&#13;
8.    One of the most important initiatives is the imminent housing privatization, which&#13;
will also affect the municipal budget. The privatization of apartments will allow the&#13;
Municipality to charge apartment residents fees that better reflect the cost of services.&#13;
More importantly, however, this will provide a basis for charging the new owners with&#13;
property taxes. The total value of apartments in MUB, with space totaling 22 million m2,&#13;
is estimated at around Tug 330 billion. Although the timing, the tax rate as well as the&#13;
allocation of tax revenue between the central and municipal government need to be&#13;
decided in the future, the introduction of a property tax on privatized apartments will give&#13;
the municipal budget a major boost.&#13;
9.    MUB also recently launched the MUB Infrastructure Development Fund, initially&#13;
funded by donations, and plans to expand the fund with various sources including&#13;
auctioning off land tenures for buildings, charging immigration fees into MUB and other&#13;
miscellaneous fees. To be more effective, this fund will require more sustainable funding&#13;
sources.&#13;

10.   Despite the various initiatives already introduced, MUB realizes that it needs a&#13;
more comprehensive and systematic approach to improve its municipal finance to meet&#13;
the increasing and changing need for urban services and infrastructure in a transitional&#13;
economy. It plans to carry out a study on municipal finance with the support of a&#13;
bilateral donor.&#13;
11.   MUB's cash flow projection, which includes the proposed project investment and&#13;
debt services, is developed and attached. Even with conservative assumption of no&#13;
property tax from apartments, it confirms the fact that MUB will not face cash flow&#13;
problems as the cash inflow from USAG more than offsets its cash outflow to GOM.&#13;
Moreover, actual revenues of MUB are expected to be greater, with the introduction of&#13;
property tax on apartments.&#13;

ANNEX 13: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS, PROJECTIONS AND&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR USAG&#13;
A. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
1.    Price Escalation. In line with the Bank's forecasts, domestic and foreign price&#13;
escalation was estimated as follows.&#13;
Year                  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005&#13;
Local Inflation(%)     25.5  20.0   20    10    10    10    10    10    10&#13;
Intemational Inflation(%)    2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5&#13;
Exchange Rate (Tug/$)  753   926  1,088  1,279  1,395  1,478  1,588  1,708  1,836&#13;
2.    Tariff Rate. The new tariff structure effective from October 1996 is assumed to&#13;
be committed to apply during 1997 for the analysis. The tariffs, however, are assumed to&#13;
be escalated in line with inflation from 1998 on. For the "with project" case, however,&#13;
three major changes are assumed:&#13;
(a)    Tariffs charged to ger area residents would fall to the same level as those&#13;
for apartment dwellers owing to the introduction of piped water supply in&#13;
ger areas;&#13;
(b)   A one-step tariff system will be introduced for apartment dwellers with the&#13;
installation of block meters. In the base case, consumption over 230 lcd&#13;
will be charged at the same rate as for industrial consumers. Accordingly,&#13;
average consumption for apartment residents is assumed to reduce to&#13;
230 lcd for the initial years. In practice, the criteria as well as the penalty&#13;
rate will be adjusted based on feedback from consumption patterns;&#13;
(c)    To ease the transition to a metering system from the current norm of&#13;
150 lcd, the tariff for apartment dwellers is assumed to decrease to a level&#13;
so that there will be no increase in the water bill if they consume 230 lcd.&#13;
3.    Block Metering. Installation of block meters will be completed during the first&#13;
three years of the project for all apartment units and industries. Installation of individual&#13;
meters will be encouraged, but would remain optional.&#13;
B. INCOME STATEMENT ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
4.    Capital Cost. The project's capital cost was developed on the basis of a detailed&#13;
schedule of capital equipment and civil works requirements. In addition, $2 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128 -                     ANNEX 13&#13;
investment in 1997 is assumed to be supplied by grant from JICA to help install meters in&#13;
CTPs and to fund other urgent repairs.&#13;
5.    Onlending Conditions. IDA funds will be onlent from the central govermnent to&#13;
USAG with the following terms and conditions:&#13;
Maturity:      20 years with a grace period of 5 years&#13;
Interest Rate  5 percent&#13;
6.    Electricity Price. The new electricity price which was increased over 60 percent&#13;
in 1996 is used as a base cut, which is then assumed to increase with the general inflation&#13;
rate.&#13;
7.    Special Fund for Maintenance and Repair. To address the problem of curtailed&#13;
budget for repair and maintenance, a special fund for maintenance and repair will be set&#13;
up. The current expenditure for maintenance will be increased by 10 percent in real terms&#13;
for the next five years and will remain at that level, with adjustments for inflation.&#13;
8.    Depreciation.  As most of USAG's existing assets were revalued recently,&#13;
historical depreciation will continue to be used for the existing assets.  For new&#13;
equipment, 25 percent declining balance depreciation will be used while civil works will&#13;
be depreciated with a 40-year straight-line method.&#13;
9.    Water Production  Currently, uncharged water amounts to 49 percent of&#13;
USAG's total water production. This is a combination of Unaccounted For Water (UFW)&#13;
and uncharged consumption of nonmetered consumers. It is assumed that uncharged&#13;
consumption of nonmetered consumers will drastically decline so that UFW will be 25&#13;
percent.&#13;
10.   Collection Ratio. In view of the transition to a new tariff structure, and metering&#13;
and possibly collection method, conservative assumptions are adopted for the collection&#13;
ratio despite the improvement in the kantor charging system. The collection ration of&#13;
institutions and apartments will increase gradually to a normal level.&#13;

ANNEX 14: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
CHOICE OF SECTOR&#13;
1.    The quality of urban services in Mongolia has deteriorated badly since the&#13;
withdrawal of Soviet assistance in 1990 and the resulting economic crisis. Since 1990,&#13;
most capital investment and expansion projects have been halted, and rehabilitation, even&#13;
minor repairs of existing assets, has been severely curtailed. In general, the formal utility&#13;
services face severe equipment problems. All equipment originated from FSU countries&#13;
and is now difficult to replace or maintain with spares because of the severance of&#13;
relationships with previous suppliers and inadequate hard currency to pay for imports.&#13;
For instance, more than 10 percent of the wells in the well fields supplying Ulaanbaatar&#13;
are inoperative due to faulty pumps; the municipal sewage plant treats only 75 percent of&#13;
the sewage due to defective pumps and equipment; and pipe breaks take three to four&#13;
days to repair due to lack of materials and equipment.&#13;
2.    Low levels of cost recovery, typical of the Soviet era when users contributed little&#13;
and utilities received substantial subsidies for new investments, have exacerbated service&#13;
delivery problems. Metering-whether water, heat, or power-on apartment blocks or&#13;
individual premises is almost nonexistent. Water and sewerage are billed on the basis of&#13;
consumption norms, and collection of bills. While tariff levels cover full costs of the&#13;
present low level of operations and depreciation, they would be insufficient to cover costs&#13;
required to fund adequate levels of maintenance and rehabilitation, much less new&#13;
investments in the systems.&#13;
3.    In mid-1994, the Government's concern about the condition of Mongolia's cities,&#13;
which had begun to show the effects of several years of forced neglect, caused it to&#13;
request Association assistance in carrying out an informal review of urban services in&#13;
Mongolia's main cities. In particular, urban issues were assessed from the perspective of&#13;
two government goals:   poverty alleviation and devolution of functions and&#13;
responsibilities to local governments. The findings of the review were discussed at&#13;
length with the Government, and the proposed project designed to meet the twin goals of&#13;
poverty alleviation and improved sector efficiency. In preparing project assistance to the&#13;
poor ger areas, a menu of possible improvements was discussed with representatives of&#13;
the 12 ger communities, who were able to choose the specific types of investments most&#13;
needed in their areas.  Consultation with the representatives continued throughout&#13;
preparation. The result is a project tailored to the needs of both the Municipality and the&#13;
ger residents and strong ownership of the initiatives planned, and balanced with&#13;
Mongolia's debt servicing capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133 -                      ANNEX 14&#13;
4.    Ger Infrastructure Improvements-Economic Evaluation.  Planned Ger&#13;
improvement covers various subcomponents reflecting the priorities of the Ger residents,&#13;
generating various economic benefits. Most of these benefits, though hard to quantify,&#13;
are substantial and directly accrue to Ger residents. Provision of total length of 10.8 km&#13;
roads, a bridge, and 28.1 km all-weather footpaths with four footbridges in areas with the&#13;
most critical needs can help save substantial time for the residents to haul coal and wood,&#13;
other household goods, as well as to fetch water. For example, the maximum travel&#13;
distance for 20 kg water fetching will be reduced from the maximum of 700 m to 350 m,&#13;
and the footpaths will help ease the labor of water fetching usually carried out by women&#13;
and children. The benefit from easier fuel hauling is no less significant, considering the&#13;
bulky nature of coal and wood and its position as the second largest expenditure item in&#13;
Ger areas. The estimated time saved or water fetching alone would amount to over 1O&#13;
million hours/year for 86,000 people, and similar saving is expected for coal, wood and&#13;
other household supplies. Paved roads can also substantially save the fuel cost and&#13;
maintenance expenditure for delivery trucks and other vehicles, as well as save the time&#13;
for delivery.  The economic rate of return for $1.4 million investment for road&#13;
construction is estimated to be over 40 percent. Construction and operation of public&#13;
bathhouses and laundries can improve the health of Ger residents.  Likewise,&#13;
improvement in solid waste collection would improve the hygiene of Ger areas&#13;
considerably. Equally important are the benefits from the construction of the stormwater&#13;
drainage in flood-prone areas, which can help reduce the property damage as well as&#13;
avoid the loss of human lives. In addition to these direct benefits, overall infrastructure&#13;
improvements would motivate the voluntary investments for further improvements in&#13;
each individual plot by each household. Some of these benefits would be captured by the&#13;
increase in property prices, particularly in light of the forthcoming privatization of urban&#13;
land. Poor families, in particular, are likely to aim to increase their income by renting&#13;
space to other families. The large plots and low density of development in Ulaanbaatar&#13;
ger area provide substantial scope for rental units. Because of the lack of a legal property&#13;
market in UB, the rapidly-shifting effects of the transition from public to private&#13;
ownership and from a managed to a market economy and the lack of data on land prices,&#13;
the above-mentioned benefits from upgrading have not been quantified. The benefits&#13;
captured in land prices change over time, also depend closely on the location of particular&#13;
Ger areas in relation to city economic activity centers, transportation services and city&#13;
economic growth. However, the experience with slum upgrading for low-income&#13;
populations in other countries is that unit land prices experience a one-time increase of&#13;
between 25 and 27 percent of preimprovement value, while the expenditure on&#13;
investment in housing and related on-plot infrastructure, such as sanitation, jumps from a&#13;
few percent of household income to as much as 30 percent or more of household income.&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
5.    The project comprises three major components: water supply in the Ger area,&#13;
water supply in central city area, and Ger area upgrading. As each component's&#13;
economic benefit has different features, the analysis is carried out by component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134-                       ANNEX 14&#13;
WATER SUPPLY INVESTMENTS&#13;
6.    In the Ger area, the benefits and costs are quantified to the extent possible. The&#13;
major benefit is the increased consumption of water to the level of 20 lcd, which is&#13;
considered the minimum requirement for health and hygiene. This benefit is measured&#13;
using the 1995 price of water adjusted to the end-1996 price level as a proxy for&#13;
consumers' willingness to pay. Additional benefits are derived from the reduction of&#13;
capital investments to purchase tanks and trucks and recurrent costs to maintain a larger&#13;
fleet of trucks as a result of piped water supply to kiosks to cover 70 percent of the Ger&#13;
area population. The EIRR is estimated at 18 percent. It should be noted that the major&#13;
benefits of the project, measured as a gap between willingness to pay and actual payment,&#13;
will accrue to Ger residents. There are other substantial benefits, although difficult to&#13;
quantify. The additional consumption of potable water will substantially enhance the&#13;
level of hygiene in Ger areas, and project investments to facilitate access to the public&#13;
water kiosks will also help relieve the labor burden of women and children, who are&#13;
traditionally responsible for hauling water.&#13;
7.    Benefit-cost analysis for water supply investments in the central city area&#13;
compares the incremental costs and benefits of the "with project" and "without project"&#13;
cases, using shadow prices to reflect economic costs to the country. Unlike traditional&#13;
projects, the benefits come from the reduced consumption of valuable resources rather&#13;
than from incremental benefits or production. In fact, the water production will decrease&#13;
with the project. The "with project" case assumes that, with the introduction of block&#13;
metering and step tariffs, the wastage of water will substantially decrease, requiring fewer&#13;
resources capital investments to purchase tanks and trucks. The benefits of treating less&#13;
wastewater as well as using fewer resources for water production are captured as USAG&#13;
covers both operations. The resultant EIRR of 14 percent, however, underrepresented the&#13;
benefits since the unquantifiable benefits of having a more stable water supply with&#13;
higher water pressure backed up by reservoirs have been excluded from the analysis.&#13;
Another major nonquantifiable benefit is the enhanced efficiency and accountability&#13;
derived from institutional strengthening supported by project technical assistance.&#13;
8.    The weighted average EIRR for the water supply components is estimated to be&#13;
15 percent, although this excludes the significant unquantifiable benefits of better&#13;
maintenance and repair, which would reduce future capital investment requirements&#13;
considerably, benefits of easier access to the piped water in Ger areas, and benefits from&#13;
the institutional strengthening component such as improved management and&#13;
strengthened accountability.&#13;
GER AREA INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
9.    Ger Infrastructure Improvements-Economic Evaluation.  Ger upgrading&#13;
would increase property values and property rentals, particularly in light of the&#13;
forthcoming privatization of urban land, which will almost certainly strengthen ger tenure&#13;
rights. Experience in other countries also shows that the upgrading, combined with better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135-                      ANNEX14&#13;
tenure tights encourages a majority of households to increase the investment on their&#13;
property in housing, on-plot sanitation and rental units. Additional indirect benefits of&#13;
upgrading coupled with tenure improvements are increases in property tax revenues-&#13;
which are likely to be imposed in Ulaanbaatar with the privatization of land and increases&#13;
in household income. Poor families, in particular, are likely to aim to increase their&#13;
income by renting space to other families.  The large plots and low density of&#13;
development in Ulaanbaatar ger area provide substantial scope for rental units. Because&#13;
of the lack of a legal property market in UB, the rapidly-shifting effects of the transition&#13;
from public to private ownership and from a managed to a market economy and the lack&#13;
of data on land prices, the above-mentioned benefits from upgrading have not been&#13;
quantified. The benefits captured in land prices change over time, also depend closely on&#13;
the location of particular Ger areas in relation to city economic activity centers,&#13;
transportation services and city economic growth. However, the experience with slum&#13;
upgrading for low-income populations in other countries is that unit land prices&#13;
experience a one-time increase of between 25 and 27 percent of preimprovement value,&#13;
while the expenditure on investment in housing and related on-plot infrastructure, such as&#13;
sanitation, jumps from a few perfect of household income to as much as 30 percent or&#13;
more of household income. Upgrading would result in large additional unquantified&#13;
benefits including: savings in the time and energy expended mostly by women and&#13;
children who fetch and haul water from kiosks to homes; improvements and health and&#13;
savings in time lost from school and work due to illness; and avoided costs of damage to&#13;
property due to flooding.&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF GER AREA WATER SUPPLY&#13;
10.   All benefits and costs are expressed in constant 1996 monetary terms. Price&#13;
escalation as well as taxes and duties are excluded. The economic internal rate of return&#13;
(EIRR) is calculated for the 20-year period with a discount rate of 12 percent.&#13;
Revenue&#13;
11.   Water Consumption. Without the project, actual per capita water consumption&#13;
was estimated at 9.5 lcd in the Ger area. The project will gradually increase the per capita&#13;
water consumption to 20 lcd, which is regarded as the minimum hygienic requirement&#13;
and is consistent with the typical average amount consumed by low-income households&#13;
who must carry their water from standpipes. In addition, total water consumption is&#13;
expected to increase in line with the population increase estimated to be 2.2 percent per&#13;
year.&#13;
12.   Willingness to Pay. As a proxy for the economic benefit, the unit water price of&#13;
Tug 400 in 1995 was used. This was adjusted to the constant 1996 price at Tug 600, and&#13;
the new tariff rate was deducted to measure the net benefit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136 -                       ANNEX 14&#13;
Capital Cost&#13;
13.   Investment. Investment costs including physical contingencies for the Ger area&#13;
piped water supply system are used for the "with project" case.&#13;
14.   Tanker Trucks. USAG' tanker subsidiary currently has 49 tanker trucks. Under&#13;
the "without project" case, the required tanks and trucks is assumed to gradually increase&#13;
to 50 each for the 10-year period, while under the "with project" case, the same number&#13;
would decrease to 30, reflecting the growing increase of the piped supply to kiosks. The&#13;
average price for a new truck and tank is assumed to be $18,000 and $900, respectively,&#13;
and the average life of a tank and a truck is assumed to be 10 years each.&#13;
Recurrent Costs&#13;
15.   Recurrent operating and maintenance costs are divided into three components:&#13;
salary and related expenses, fuel and vehicle related expenses, and others. Fuel and other&#13;
vehicle-related costs are directly affected by the number of trucks and tanks. Salary-&#13;
related expenses and other costs are also adjusted accordingly. The reduction in salaries&#13;
and "others" are transferred to the central city area benefit-cost analysis, as the extra&#13;
human resources are assumed to be absorbed in the central city area operation.&#13;
Economic Cost&#13;
16.   Conversion Factor. The conversion factors used to convert electricity price is&#13;
1.33 for the first three years, and this will gradually converge to 1.0 in 2002 in line with&#13;
the expected price increase. As for the labor cost, a conversion factor of 1.4 was used to&#13;
reflect the lagging wage adjustments under high inflation.&#13;
17.   Sensitivity Test. A test to measure the sensitivity of EIRR of the water supply&#13;
component was carried out for major variables, including different level of water&#13;
consumption by ger residents as well as apartment residents. If the average water&#13;
consumption by ger residents turns out to be 15 lcd and 25 lcd, rather than assumed&#13;
20 lcd, the resultant EIRR would change to 14 and 17.8 percent, respectively. Likewise,&#13;
if the average apartment resident consume 200 lcd and 250 lcd of water instead of 230 lcd&#13;
in the base case, the EIRR would be 16.7 and 14.4 percent, respectively. This is&#13;
consistent with the analysis, as the major sources of economic benefits are increased&#13;
welfare in Ger area and the savings of valuable resources from the reduction of waste in&#13;
apartments. Thus, even under the unfavorable scenarios of lower water consumption in&#13;
Ger area or less-than-expected level of wastage reduction in apartments, the project&#13;
remains viable. It is also important to note that, under both scenarios, the effect on the&#13;
financial viability of the project is negligible.&#13;

ANNEX 15: GER AREA UPGRADING AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Population. The total Ger population is estimated to be about 300,000 in 1996.&#13;
Since 1991, it had been decreasing slightly, but recently started to slowly increase as&#13;
apartment construction practically ceased.&#13;
2.    About 45 percent of UB's population live in the Ger areas. The density of Ger&#13;
areas is very low, varying from 54 persons/ha in Nisek to 198 persons/ha in Gandan in&#13;
the flat, low-lying city center. A significant number of people keep animals on their plots&#13;
and some have gardens. Except for deeply-ravined Shar Khad, the population in the flat&#13;
areas to the east of the city in Bayanzurkh had been decreasing, but is likely to increase in&#13;
the future.&#13;
3.    The population forecasts suggest that the population of the Ger Areas could&#13;
double by about 2012, if gers grow faster than the rest of the city. There appear to be few&#13;
options to accommodate this increase in suitable (existing) areas, where infrastructure can&#13;
be provided.&#13;
4.    The three areas that topographically are most suited to accommodate the growth&#13;
are the flat areas in Bayanzurkh, mentioned above, the Naddam celebration site near the&#13;
airport to the southeast of the city and the central wellfield area, if other water sources can&#13;
be identified. Each of these options poses planning and development difficulties and in&#13;
order to assess these and any other options, further study is required.&#13;
5.    Incomes. Ger household incomes (in 1995/96) were as low as Tug 15,000 ($25&#13;
equivalent), or a median income of about Tug 30,000 in 1995 and Tug 40,000 in 1996,&#13;
respectively (or $55 and $60, respectively). A sample survey in 1996 indicated that&#13;
average ger incomes were about Tug 60,000, if capital expenditures were included.&#13;
Many of the Ger residents appear to be elderly pensioners, the unemployed or&#13;
underemployed and single-parent female households, for whom in the absence of&#13;
subsidized apartment housing, the Ger is an affordable housing solution.  Solid&#13;
information about apartment incomes is unavailable but it is probably safe to say that Ger&#13;
incomes are about 70 percent of those of people in apartments.&#13;
6.    Ger Locations. Most of the Gers-except for Yarmag and Nisek-are located on&#13;
the north bank of the Tuul River, the city's public water source. With the exception of&#13;
the Gandan area, the majority of Ger area is in the periphery of the city at a distance of 2&#13;
to 12 km from the built-up area of UB, which parallels the Tuul River (Table 1 below).&#13;
Many of the Ger population live on the hills to the north of the city along the Selbe and&#13;
Tolgoit River valleys, where the Ger population had been mostly increasing. These areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                      ANNEX 15&#13;
are drained by natural ravines, which increasingly erode their banks, due to dumping of&#13;
solid waste in them by Ger residents. The disruption of drainage channels combined with&#13;
a lack of paved, stabilized or graded roads, limits access by water trucks, buses and other&#13;
vehicles and also hampers residents' access to and transport from water kiosks, especially&#13;
in winter.&#13;

7.    During the winter months, there is severe low-level atmospheric pollution of the&#13;
City arising from the burning of coal and wood in the basic stoves used in all gers. There&#13;
have been many studies into ways of alleviating this situation, including the raising of the&#13;
height of the flues. A possible project to import Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for&#13;
domestic use and by industry exists. The estimated annual cost for ger fuel consumption&#13;
is among the largest items of household expenditure.&#13;
8.    An increasing number of the Ger population live at altitudes above that of the&#13;
existing reservoirs close to the city and the new reservoirs to be constructed under the&#13;
project. This form of settlement needs to be constrained by a combination of revisions in&#13;
land use in the Master Plan (para. 10 below), land regulation and institutions, and&#13;
arrangements to provide or withhold services (such as water supply).&#13;
9.    Planning Considerations. Until recently, Ger areas were considered to be&#13;
temporary until apartment accommodation was built. Occupants were only given a right&#13;
to occupy by the Municipal Duuregs for an unspecified time and sometimes after&#13;
occupation of sites had taken place. This weak, impermanent form of tenure, combined&#13;
with generally low Ger incomes, inhibits investment in house construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-142 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
10.   The current Master Plan was prepared in 1986, before the massive changes in&#13;
Mongolia's political and economic situation forced the curtailment of the apartment&#13;
building program. In the longer run, the inefficient current Ger layout in long lanes and&#13;
large (400-700 m 2) plots, without reservations for community open space and facilities,&#13;
will need to be redeveloped. The Master Plan needs to be revised to incorporate the&#13;
current situation in which the majority of the Ger areas are likely to develop into&#13;
permanent residential areas. Also, the form of tenure to be provided to Ger residents&#13;
under the ongoing (in 1997) program to privatize housing and land should take into&#13;
account, if possible, future needs to restructure the infrastructure and reassemble plots in&#13;
a more efficient configuration, suitable for an urban environment.&#13;
11.   Water Supply. Since the 1960s, truck tanker water supply replaced wells or&#13;
horse-borne transport; and in the 1970s water-dispensing kiosks were introduced. But the&#13;
service is unreliable.&#13;
12.   Water is usually fetched from kiosks to homes, in small-wheeled handcarts,&#13;
loaded with up to 40 kg of water, over a distance of 200-700 m, mostly by women and&#13;
children, over rough hilly, unstable and unsurfaced earth paths and roads. In the winter,&#13;
ice and snow impede access to the kiosks by both tanker trucks and ger residents and&#13;
water supply is erratic. Ger consumption from kiosks is about 8 lcd; the amount is&#13;
limited by both cost and the difficulty of transporting the water and is well below the&#13;
minimum requirement for good health and sanitation of 20 lcd. The total water&#13;
consumed in Ger areas, although probably underestimated by USAG, is only 2.2 million&#13;
m3/day, not even 2 percent of USAG's daily demand.&#13;
13.   The high costs of tankered water have been inequitably passed through to Ger&#13;
residents; they pay 20-30 times more per unit of water than apartment residents, whose&#13;
costs are subsidized by institutional water consumers (industrial, commercial and public&#13;
premises). Because of the high price of water and the difficulties in transporting it from&#13;
kiosks to homes, many Ger residents supplement their water supply from other,&#13;
sometimes unsanitary sources: rivers, surface water, wells and rainwater. During project&#13;
preparation, the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) recognized the inequity of Ger and&#13;
apartment water charges and held ger unit charges constant while increasing apartment&#13;
charges by over 50 percent.&#13;
14.   The principal thrust of the project is to replace high-cost tankered water with&#13;
much lower-priced and better-quality water, more consistently available, from the piped&#13;
system. Standards and designs for the project water supply component are discussed in&#13;
Annexes 1. 2 and 4.&#13;
15.   Health and Sanitation. The inequity in and inadequacy of public services (lack&#13;
of adequate heating, water, sanitation and social facilities) compounded by low incomes&#13;
leads to significant nutritional, as well as morbidity and health differences, between Ger&#13;
and apartment areas. A UNICEF nutrition survey of 1993 found that infants born into ger&#13;
area families had a 60 percent higher risk of low weight than those born in apartments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143 -                       ANNEX 15&#13;
Also, at least 80 percent of children in the Ger who are under five years old suffer from&#13;
diarrhea in summer and acute respiratory infections in winter.  (The equivalent&#13;
percentages of children in apartments are less than 30 and 40 percent, respectively.)&#13;
Upgrading of public services and living conditions in Ger area under the project,&#13;
particularly water supply, would help relieve the hardships of the urban poor while&#13;
improving environmental conditions with attendant health benefits.&#13;
16.   There were bathhouses and washing facilities in the Ger. However, these were&#13;
privatized in the first half of the 1990s; the prices set by MUB proved to be uneconomic&#13;
and by 1996 only a few were still operating. Many Ger residents are said, perforce, to&#13;
bathe in their relatives' apartments. Surveys indicate that lack of bathhouses is regarded&#13;
as a major problem by Ger residents.&#13;
17.   The project would provide the following bathhouse and laundry facilities in&#13;
project ger areas:&#13;
(a)    Hailast. Improvement of existing facilities and addition of laundries;&#13;
(b)   Denjin and Chingeltei. A new bathhouse including laundry facilities;&#13;
(c)    Dambadarjaa. A new bathhouse including laundry facilities, and;&#13;
(d)   Gandan. Installation of a laundry facility&#13;
18.   Most Ger plots have simple pit latrines for human waste disposal. Due to the low,&#13;
but increasing densities in Ger and the nature of soils, the existing sanitation methods,&#13;
though crude, are not a major problem, except possibly in the low-lying Ger area near the&#13;
floodplain of the Tuul River.&#13;
19.   Roads and Paths. In the Ger area roads and paths are almost entirely rough earth&#13;
unconsolidated, poorly bridged and undrained. In the deeply ravined Ger area, access for&#13;
vehicles of all types and pedestrians is difficult. The lack of storm drainage channels, the&#13;
alignment of roads, often parallel to slopes, and lack of maintenance all impede and&#13;
increase the costs of access for buses, trucks and other vehicles. In addition, the terraces&#13;
of plots and access paths to them can be extremely long (up to 600 m of continuous&#13;
frontage).&#13;
20.   Criteria for Roads and Paths. Under the project, pedestrian access proposals&#13;
are based on the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   No journey of more than 150 m should be necessary on an unmade surface&#13;
when collecting water.&#13;
(b)   The total journey to collect water should not be more than 350 m.&#13;
(c)    These distances should be actual and not "as-the-crow-flies."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-144 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
21.   The project would provide the following roads and footpaths in project ger areas:&#13;
Gandan             Roads: 2.2 km;     Footpaths: 1.8 km&#13;
Denjin 1000        Roads: 2.8 km;     Footpaths: 10.1 km&#13;
Hailast            Roads: 0.5 km      Footpaths: 6.3 km&#13;
Chingeltei         Roads: 2.0 km      Footpaths: 5.0 km    1 Road bridge&#13;
and 3 footbridges&#13;
Dambadarjaa        Roads: 3.3 km      Footpaths: 4.9 km    1 Footbridge&#13;
22.   Design Criteria - Roads and Paths&#13;
(a)   Road Widths. Pavement: 5.5 m. Shoulders: 1.25 m. (No land acquisition&#13;
required, since existing rights-of-way are generous.&#13;
(b)   Road Pavement. Asphaltic concrete and gravel. Subbase material, CBR&#13;
35; base material, CBR 60; commercial vehicles design volume: Black&#13;
Market Road-250/day. Other roads-80/day. On this basis, all roads&#13;
except for the Black Market Road would have a total pavement thickness&#13;
of 275 mm, of which Base, 175 mm, and AC surface course, 100 mm.&#13;
The more heavily trafficked Black Market Road would be as follows: a&#13;
total pavement thickness of 400 mm, of which base, 100 mm, subbase,&#13;
200 mm and AC surface course, 100 mm.&#13;
(c)   Road Crossing of Creeks and Gullies. Reinforced concrete pipe culverts&#13;
(except Chingeltei where bridge will be standard design for a 9 m span);&#13;
Maximum velocity: 3.5 m/sec.&#13;
(d)   Footpaths. 1 m wide for access to house lanes. 1.2 m wide for collector&#13;
streets in ger areas. Alignment would be generally 0.5 m from plot fences&#13;
on the side of the street/lane opposite utilities (power, telephone poles and&#13;
proposed water lines). Footpaths would be reinforced sufficiently to&#13;
withstand a 4-ton wheel load to accommodate trucks driving with one&#13;
wheel on the footpath.&#13;
(e)   Footpaths would be located according to the following criteria:&#13;
(i)   to provide direct access to kiosks.&#13;
(ii)   no plot more than 100 m from a footpath&#13;
(iii)   highest priority to steep-slope and erosion areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-145 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
Solid Waste&#13;
23.   Ger used to get door-to-door solid waste collection services. The system has&#13;
deteriorated due to lack of funds for operations and is now irregular from identifiable but&#13;
uncontrolled points that are a maximum of 500 m from houses. Consequently, residents&#13;
commonly dump their waste in drainage channels and natural ravines. Drainage capacity,&#13;
thus, has been substantially reduced, causing local flooding and property damage&#13;
sometimes. The project would provide several compactor collection trucks and about 600&#13;
3-mr3 steel bins in Gandan (50); Denjin (230), Hailast (100); Chingeltei (100); and&#13;
Dambadarjaa (1 15).&#13;
Project Standards and Criteria for Solid Waste&#13;
24.   To alleviate these problems, it was considered that under the project the criteria&#13;
should be that: the maximum distance that residents should be required to carry their&#13;
solid waste should be limited; and the locations of solid waste collection points needed to&#13;
be adjacent to suitable access roads, which in the cases of deeply ravined and floodplain&#13;
areas would be have to be paved if the service was to function in all weathers.&#13;
25.   From studies of the solid waste collection service, it also became apparent that&#13;
significant improvements to the service and costs could be recovered if larger collection&#13;
trucks were employed with compactor equipment. The project therefore aims to&#13;
supplement the pedestrian-access standard and introduce a vehicular access standard such&#13;
that:&#13;
(a)   No resident should need to carry their solid waste more than 200 m to an&#13;
authorized collection point.&#13;
(b)   All-weather roads would be proposed to facilitate collection by larger&#13;
collection vehicles.&#13;
(c)   The distances should be actual and not "as-the-crow-flies."&#13;
26.   A standard of 5.5 m for road pavement width was adopted to allow two-way&#13;
working of solid waste trucks and buses within the low trafficked areas.&#13;
27.   The width of 1.2 m for footpaths was adopted to allow handcarts to pass;&#13;
however, it is acknowledged that for much of the year it is possible to pass on the&#13;
adjacent surface and, therefore, the edge treatment of paths requires attention to detail.&#13;
Road and pedestrian bridges would be consistent with these standards.&#13;
Stormwater Drainage&#13;
28.   Ulaanbaatar is mainly drained by three rivers flowing from north to south into the&#13;
Tuul River, which runs east to west. These rivers are from east to west: Uliastai, Selbe,&#13;
Tolgoit and Naragiin.   Their tributaries include the Chingeltei, Hailast and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-146-                       ANNEX 15&#13;
Denjinmiyanga, which drain to the Selbe. Most of the drainage in the Ger area feeds into&#13;
the north-south rivers: Uliastai, Selbe, Tolgoit. Over the long term, the annual volume of&#13;
rainwater has been increasing and with it in recent years, flooding (in 1966, 1982 and&#13;
1994), a rise in the groundwater level and ground heave in expanding permafrost areas.&#13;
29.   A fundamental storm drainage problem is that Ger Khoroos have developed over&#13;
areas that are either steep-sloping or are adjacent to hills and are subject to seasonal storm&#13;
runoff. Ger areas also straddle the natural drainage routes to the river Tuul, as do formal&#13;
developments and the city center, which have been developed across the natural route of&#13;
the river Selbe.&#13;
30.   In addition, many of the tertiary channels have been filled with solid waste over&#13;
many years and while they may retain their drainage function, local flooding is caused&#13;
during the heaviest rainfall. On the other hand, in the absence of bridges, the deposits of&#13;
waste assist in providing access across the deeply ravined areas during the remainder of&#13;
the year.&#13;
31.   Another major problem is created by mudflows from the streams flowing to the&#13;
rivers Uliastai, Selbe, Tolgoit, and Naragiin. Mud and the larger shingle transported by&#13;
the main rivers themselves, restricts flow in the main drainage channels. However, no&#13;
regular attempt appears to be made to ensure that all the channels are clear and free of&#13;
solid waste. This is particularly so at culverts under roads that sometimes also suffer&#13;
from having less capacity than upstream channels.&#13;
32.   In the Denjin ger area, for example, there is are no formal stormwater drainage&#13;
provisions, while there are over 12 stormwater gullies and ravines with a total length of&#13;
9,000 m (lengths range from 120 m to 2,000 m). In winter, springwater charges freeze,&#13;
affecting 30-40 households. In summer, flooding results in human casualties and&#13;
property damage.&#13;
33.   The lack of maintenance of the piped stormwater system in the city is evident&#13;
during heavy storms as runoff is not accepted by the road gullies. Possibly many missing&#13;
gully covers were removed and traded as scrap metal; and many have been officially&#13;
removed and stored as a precaution against theft. All of this necessitates the regular&#13;
cleaning and emptying of each gully, for which there is no special equipment and,&#13;
consequently, the gullies are frequently full of debris.&#13;
34.   MUB had developed a program to alleviate flooding-in Ger and regular areas of&#13;
the city-as the drainage solutions are necessarily linked-and to reduce the rising&#13;
groundwater and permafrost expansion. These phenomena have been studied in detail by&#13;
MUB's Water Policy Unit (WPU). The WPU's main recommendation was to introduce a&#13;
system of horizontal and vertical ground drainage in Sukhbaatar (100 ail) to the north of&#13;
the city center.&#13;
35.   Following serious flooding in 1966, 1982 and 1994 in the north of the city, MUB&#13;
prepared an urgent program of works to prevent further damage. Without detailed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-147 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
assessment it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of these&#13;
investments; however, inspection suggests that finding has sometimes dictated the extent&#13;
and dimensions of the sections used and these may be inadequate and inconsistent in&#13;
some locations.&#13;
36.  In Naran, for example, which is close to the city, an extensive cutoff drain was&#13;
built to protect Ger and the apartments below them, which can be densified-possibly&#13;
with apartments. But, the area above the channel and the apartments continues to develop&#13;
in Ger and is not protected from hillside runoff.&#13;
37.   Nevertheless, the incidences of serious flooding appear to have been reduced by&#13;
the works that have been completed and flooding continues to be concentrated in those&#13;
areas where projects have been identified but not yet implemented.&#13;
Selection Criteria for Drainage in Project Areas&#13;
38.   The following criteria were applied to select areas where project storm drainage&#13;
works would be implemented:&#13;
(a)   surveyed communities gave high priority to storm drainage improvements,&#13;
because of previous experience with damage due to flooding and erosion;&#13;
(b)   improvements to drainage capacity would improve and control runoff and&#13;
reduce the damage to property and lives; and&#13;
(c)   works previously identified MUB or the Water Policy Unit for inclusion in&#13;
their works program.&#13;
39.   Drainage proposals were estimated based on the experience of the existing&#13;
system. Two trapezoidal standards were adopted. Further detailed studies of the network&#13;
were made during project preparation in order to finalize cost estimates. Three standard&#13;
culverts were designed to allow uninterrupted flow through two standard channels and to&#13;
provide a standard solution for crossing the remaining natural ravines.&#13;
40.   The following stormwater drainage works would be carried out under the project&#13;
in three ger areas:&#13;
(a)   Denjin. Construction of both earth and concrete-faced channels and&#13;
filling of one eroded gully area and construction of a low-flow channel;&#13;
(b)   Chingeltei. Construction of an extension of the Chingeltei channel and&#13;
construction of piped drainage in badly scoured areas in the northeast&#13;
section of the Ger area; and&#13;
(c)   Dambadarjaa. Construction of flood protection walls and levees and&#13;
low-flow channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-148 -                    ANNEX 15&#13;
41.   A number of potentially worthwhile storm drainage projects were considered&#13;
during project preparation, but could not be included in the project because of constraints&#13;
on funding, implementation capacity and the need for a more methodical stormwater&#13;
drainage planning study. They are, however, worth mentioning, as outlined below with&#13;
preliminary 1995 cost estimates.&#13;
(a)   Diversion of the flow from the Denjinmiyanga River to the Selbe River&#13;
along the line of the channel recently constructed by the Municipality&#13;
(Tug 40 million).&#13;
(b)   Diversion of the Naragiin River north of the Oil Depot (and north of the&#13;
road through Tolgoit) (Tug 220 million).&#13;
(c)   Reinstatement of gully gratings in the city center with a hinged grating&#13;
(Tug 23 million).&#13;
(d)   Creation of a balancing lake on the Selbe River, north of Dambadarjaa.&#13;
(e)   Extension of the lake at Bayangol (Naran) with the raising of the dam&#13;
height.&#13;
(f)   Creation of a new balancing lake on the West Tolgoit River, north of&#13;
Songino-Khairkhan ( Baiyankoshuu).&#13;
(g)   Implementation of debris filters, whether as sabo dams or other devices on&#13;
the Selbe, Naragiin and Tolgoit Rivers.&#13;
(h)   Development of a storm drainage maintenance plan and provision of&#13;
maintenance equipment.&#13;
42.   Housing. In the UB Ger areas, housing is a mixture of many uninsulated, small&#13;
wooden buildings, a few brick or stucco buildings, with tarpaper roofs laid on boards, and&#13;
"Ger." The centuries-old Mongolian "Ger" is basically a cheap (about $600 in 1996)&#13;
one-room, circular (4-7 m diameter), mushroom-shaped, demountable tent, with&#13;
transportable wooden frames and a thick felt and canvas covering, with substantial&#13;
insulation but short heat retention value. Surveys indicate that in UB, permanent, heated&#13;
(but mostly uninsulated) wooden houses are replacing Ger. The Ger areas are being&#13;
transformed into private housing areas for all social groups, in the absence of funding&#13;
now and in the foreseeable future for apartment construction.&#13;
COST RECOVERY IN GER AREA UPGRADING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
43.   About $4.8 million (including contingencies on $3.2 million base costs) will be&#13;
spent under the project by MUB for infrastructure improvements including roads,&#13;
footpaths, stormwater drains, washing facilities and solid waste collections. The amount&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-149 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
does not include the cost of improvements under the project in Ger area water supply,&#13;
which will also be made in the areas to be upgraded.&#13;
44.   To establish priorities for improving Ger areas under the project, Ger areas were&#13;
ranked according to the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   health conditions and access to health services (e.g., socioeconomic&#13;
conditions);&#13;
(b)   population size and population density;&#13;
(c)   availability of services;&#13;
(d)   services construction and supply logistical conditions (e.g., ground&#13;
conditions, permafrost, slope, erosion and access, building relocation or&#13;
property acquisition requirements, which were given 50 percent weight in&#13;
the analysis);&#13;
(e)   town planning and future city development requirements; and&#13;
(f)   community willingness to participate in identification of priority&#13;
investments, and to pay ger improvement charges for them.&#13;
45.   About 86,000 people, or 16,900 households reside in the project Ger areas in&#13;
which infrastructure will be upgraded. These areas would also be benefited by the piped&#13;
water supply to be constructed under the project, which covers all 12 of the priority Ger&#13;
areas and would benefit about 169,000 people in 1,338 hectares of Ger area in 1996 or an&#13;
estimated 210,000 people in 2010.&#13;
46.   Due to resource constraints, only about 50 percent of the population in 12 Ger&#13;
areas suitable for improvement could be included in project; and only a minimum of&#13;
essential improvements could be made in those areas.  A substantial amount of&#13;
improvement work remains to be done in the future in both USIP and non-USIP areas,&#13;
when more resources can be made available.&#13;
47.   The objectives of a Ger Infrastructure Account (GIA) that would be established&#13;
under the project (see Operational Action Plan) are:&#13;
(a)   through GIA fees, to recover some of MUB's AusAID grant funding for&#13;
the Ger infrastructure improvement program;&#13;
(b)   to generate resources for infrastructure improvements in the Ger area,&#13;
which could not be included in the USIP because of constraints on&#13;
funding;&#13;
(c)   to charge GIA fees which are affordable; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-150 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
(d)   to encourage a sense of commitment among Ger residents to Ger&#13;
improvements.&#13;
GER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM-CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
48.   With a view  to building up resources for future improvements and for&#13;
maintenance of ger infrastructure, the establishment of a Ger Infrastructure Improvement&#13;
account was agreed to with MUB. Details of approaches to charges and generating&#13;
revenue for the account are given below and in the attached table.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-151-                      ANNEX 15&#13;
According to the Ger Infrastructure Fund Calculations:&#13;
(a)   Only ger households/plots getting project infrastructure ex-piped water&#13;
(86,400 people equivalent to about 17,000 ger plots) would be charged for&#13;
improvements;&#13;
(b)   An affordable charge of 1 percent of average household income would be&#13;
charged;&#13;
(c)   Ger beneficiaries would be charged only for on-site improvements,&#13;
defined as being roads, paths, storm drains, etc., which are located in the&#13;
immediate vicinity of Ger plots and primarily benefit adjacent ger plots.&#13;
The rest of the road and stormwater drainage improvements would be&#13;
considered as off-site improvements, which link ger area to the central city&#13;
system and benefit the city population as a whole, and costs would be&#13;
recovered from general city revenues, including possibly a future property&#13;
tax.&#13;
(d)   The charges would be collected quarterly from ger plot holders by the&#13;
Khoroos, in the same manner as solid waste charges are now collected;&#13;
and would commence in each Ger area as and when improvements were&#13;
completed in an area. The charges would be revised annually by MUB to&#13;
correspond to the inflationary increase in improvement costs, except that&#13;
the percentage increase in the charge would not exceed the percentage&#13;
increase in ger incomes in the previous year.&#13;
(e)   MUB would establish a separate Ger Improvement Account maintained as&#13;
a Revolving Fund in a separate account;&#13;
(f)   Collections of improvement charges accruing to the Account would be&#13;
used only for additional improvements in project ger areas, nonproject Ger&#13;
areas, ger infrastructure maintenance, or such other Ger area activities as&#13;
might be agreed between IDA and MUB from time to time.&#13;
(g)   As illustrated in table below, a charge of Tug 500/month/plot, equivalent&#13;
to about 1 percent of average 1996 ger household income, would generate&#13;
about Tug 102 million per year ($156,000 equivalent) and recover 50&#13;
percent of the $2.5 million (base cost) of ger improvements in eight years.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
49.   The Benefits of the user charge, established as described above, and illustrated in&#13;
the table attached would be:&#13;
(a)   A modest recovery of funds invested by MUB in Ger infrastructure&#13;
improvements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-152 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
(b)   Affordable Improvement Charges. The charges, set at a small percentages&#13;
of Ger household income, would be affordable to Ger households who are&#13;
the poorest segment of the UB population;&#13;
(c)   Additional Ger Infrastructure Improvements. The revenues in the ger area&#13;
improvement account could be used by MUB to implement small high-&#13;
priority infrastructure improvements in project and nonproject Ger area,&#13;
which could not be improved under USIP; and&#13;
(d)   Enhancement of the market value of Ger plots, particularly in view of the&#13;
anticipated privatization of Ger land and strengthening of tenure on ger&#13;
plots, which the payment of the infrastructure charge would also&#13;
strengthen.&#13;

            Mongolia - Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The general objectives of the
            Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project are to assist the
            Government to: (i) address the inequity of services between
            ger and formal housing areas, thereby improving the quality
            of life of the low-income population; (ii) restore levels
            and quality of water supply services in the Municipality and
            make that supply accessible to the ger areas; and (iii)
            develop more efficient and autonomous, performance-oriented
            institutions, with a view to eventual privatization.
            Project's specific objectives are to: (i) improve the
            quality, quantity and reliability of water supply; (ii)
            substantially lower the unit cost of water supply to ger
            areas; (iii) improve ger area infrastructure; (iv) arrest
            the deterioration in, and improve the reliability and
            quality of, the city water distribution system; (v) reduce
            water wastage, the production of nonrevenue-producing water,
            and water production costs; (vi) replace the current
            norm-based water and sanitation billing system to one that
            is quantity-based; and (vii) develop the water and
            sanitation company of Ulaanbaatar's (USAG's)
            capabilities for financial and operational management and
            convert it into a self-financing commercially-oriented
            public utility.  The project will include: 1) physical
            investments such as strengthening of water supply
            distribution network, concrete reservoirs construction,
            insulated pipelines, water leakage and wastage reduction
            program, equipment and tools for maintenance and meter
            repair workshops, sewer observation and cleaning equipment,
            and Ger Area Infrastructure Upgrading Program; and 2)
            institutional component consisting of technical assistance
            in project management, institutional strengthening of USAG,
            studies reviewing the long-term development and planning of
            ger areas and definition of appropriate levels of public
            services, and development of and training in a computerized
            USAG billing and collection system for metered supplies.
