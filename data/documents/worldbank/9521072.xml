Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Latin America, only 13.7 percent of the collected wastewater receives treatment before it is discharged&#13;
&#13;
to the environment or reused in agriculture (WHO and PAHO 2001). Efforts to mitigate negative&#13;
environmental impacts and reduce public health risks require the development of low-cost wastewater&#13;
&#13;
treatment technologies that effectively eliminate wastewater contaminants and are simple to operate and&#13;
maintain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report provides an overview of how constructed wetlands serve as natural wastewater treatment&#13;
&#13;
systems. It focuses especially on the subsurface horizontal flow type--a technology that has high&#13;
potential for small and medium-size communities because of its simplicity, performance reliability, and low&#13;
&#13;
operation and maintenance requirements. The ability of this wetland to reduce pathogens renders the&#13;
effluent suitable for irrigation of certain crop species if additional health and environmental protection&#13;
&#13;
measures are taken. This report describes several experiences with constructed wetland schemes in&#13;
Central and South America: a full-scale pilot plant in Nicaragua, a community-managed constructed&#13;
&#13;
wetland scheme in El Salvador, and other systems in Colombia, Brazil, and Peru.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although the report focuses on technology issues, it stresses the importance of adequate arrangements&#13;
for operation and maintance to guarantee the long-term treatment performance of the constructed wetland&#13;
&#13;
scheme. Furthermore, community participation and complementary actions such as promoting hygiene are&#13;
crucial elements for sustainable wastewater treatment projects and maximization of health and&#13;
&#13;
environmental benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As part of its knowledge management agenda, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) promotes the&#13;
dissemination of this technology. This report is directed at sector professionals, central and local&#13;
&#13;
governments, research centers, and donors interested in adopting, promoting, implementing, and financing&#13;
constructed wetland technology for wastewater treatment, with a view toward improving the well-being of&#13;
&#13;
the beneficiary population and the environment.&#13;

I would like to express my appreciation to Martin Gauss for preparing this document. An Austrian&#13;
sanitation expert with WSP-LAC, he has been working in Central America in the field of alternative&#13;
&#13;
sanitation technologies, including constructed wetlands, for three years. I also wish to acknowledge the&#13;

                       I. Wastewater management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       The urban population of Latin America and the&#13;
                       Caribbean is growing quickly, and it is expected to rise&#13;
                       from the current 77 percent to 80 percent by the year&#13;
                       2015 (UNDP 2006). At the same time, Latin Americans&#13;
                       are very demanding of the service level of the water&#13;
                       and sanitation infrastructure. In many countries,&#13;
                       sewerage systems are the preferred solution to&#13;
                       conveying wastewater out of urban areas. However,&#13;
                       only a small percentage of the recollected wastewater&#13;
                       in the region receives any treatment (figure 1.1).&#13;
&#13;

                       The fact that only a small percentage of wastewater is            Untreated wastewater in a poor neighborhood of Iquitos&#13;

                       being treated has negative impacts on the region's&#13;
                       ecosystems and leads to environmental degradation.&#13;
                       Moreover, the reuse of crude wastewater for crop&#13;
                       production in many periurban areas of towns and cities            families, and consumers of contaminated crops. It is&#13;

                                                                                         irrigated with wastewater, most of which has received&#13;
                                                                                         no treatment (Peasey et al. 2000).&#13;

The surface flow or free water surface wetland&#13;
technology is strongly related to natural wetlands.&#13;
Wetlands have been used for wastewater discharge&#13;
for as long as sewage has been collected. After&#13;
monitoring of some of the discharges began, an&#13;
awareness of the potential of water quality purification&#13;
started to emerge. The "technology" arose in the 1970s&#13;
in North America with the ecological engineering of&#13;
natural wetlands for wastewater treatment (Kadlec and&#13;
Knight 1996).                                                              -proof&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comparative advantages and limitations&#13;
&#13;
Constructed wetlands are natural treatment systems&#13;
that offer a variety of advantages that make them&#13;
suitable for small to medium-size communities in&#13;
developing countries, particularly in tropical regions.&#13;
Comparative advantages, in particular of the&#13;
subsurface horizontal flow type, include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are low&#13;
    because (1) the natural biological treatment&#13;
    processes are enhanced by high ambient and&#13;
    wastewater temperatures; (2) there are low or no&#13;
    external energy requirements; and (3) there is no&#13;
                                                                  The treatment plant is attractive because of the&#13;

develop their root systems in the filter material. The         used filter material for constructed wetlands in this&#13;
water level of the constructed wetland is always kept a        region (see appendix B for further technical&#13;
few centimeters below the surface of the filter bed by         specifications). In the inlet and outlet areas of the&#13;
adjusting the standpipe in the effluent collection             SSHF constructed wetland, coarse gravel is used to&#13;
chamber.                                                       facilitate wastewater distribution and recollection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coarse sand and gravel are preferred filter materials&#13;
for this type of constructed wetland. Criteria for&#13;
selecting the filter media are size and granulometry,&#13;
which determine hydraulic permeability and porosity,&#13;
and physical resistance to the wear caused by&#13;
wastewater. Careful selection of the appropriate filter&#13;
media is of the highest importance for a well-&#13;
functioning system. Because of its wide availability in&#13;
Central America, volcanic rock5 is the most widely&#13;

                   Wetland plants&#13;
&#13;
                   Wetland plants play several roles in the SSHF&#13;
                   constructed wetland. Their root systems provide&#13;
                   surfaces for the attachment of microorganisms,&#13;
                   enhance filtration effects, and stabilize the bed surface.&#13;
                   The roots contribute to the development of&#13;
                   microorganisms by the release of oxygen and&#13;
                   nutrients. Moreover, the plants give the treatment site&#13;
                   an attractive appearance, and some plant species can&#13;
                   be used for several purposes after harvesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   It is recommended that locally available emergent&#13;
                   plant species that can tolerate stagnant water&#13;
                   conditions be used. In Central America, common reed&#13;
                   (Phragmites australis) is widely used because of its&#13;
                                                                               Helicona species used as wetland plants.&#13;

                   reeds to make various products. Other plant species&#13;
                   used in the region are elephant grass (Pennisetum&#13;
                   purpureum), which serves as animal forage, and&#13;

  coliform concentrations are indicative of the effectiveness of the treatment process in removing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.&#13;
c Because of the large number of pathogens contained in wastewater, removal efficiency is expressed in log units rather than in&#13;

                 Pretreatment&#13;
&#13;
                 The pretreatment stage consists of a manually cleaned&#13;
                 screen to hold back bulk objects. In addition, it is&#13;
                 recommended that a simple grit and grease removal&#13;
                 unit be provided, because people tend to connect their&#13;
                 stormwater drain pipes to the sewerage system, which&#13;
                 results in large amounts of fine solids in the&#13;
                 wastewater during the rainy season. Coarse solid&#13;
                 residues from the screen can be burned or deposited&#13;
                 at the municipal garbage site. Hydraulic overloading of&#13;
                 the system can be prevented by installing an overflow&#13;
                 device to divert peak flows during rain events. A simple&#13;
                 flow measurement device, such as a Parshall channel&#13;
                 (see photo), can be installed after the pretreatment unit&#13;
                 to monitor the flow rate.&#13;
                                                                                    Flow measurement (Parshall channel) and Imhoff tank at the&#13;

&#13;
Adequate construction site. The construction site for the&#13;
system must be stable and adequately drained to&#13;
avoid flooding of the entire site, including the treatment&#13;
units. A topography offering an adequate slope would&#13;
be desirable to avoid pumping and the related energy&#13;
requirements. The groundwater level must be&#13;
sufficiently deep to avoid problems during and after&#13;
construction. Complete sealing of the constructed&#13;
wetland beds is compulsory to avoid seepage and&#13;
groundwater contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Capacity of SSHF constructed wetland systems. In&#13;
theory, there is no upper limit on the maximum flow&#13;
rate and the corresponding size of the constructed&#13;
wetlands, provided that larger systems are subdivided&#13;
into single units, restricting their width and length18 to     irrigation. Raw wastewater and the treated effluent,&#13;
&#13;
control hydraulic conditions and facilitate O&amp;M (Brix          although to a much lesser level, contain enteric&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
systems will be determined by factors such as the              diarrhea, typhoid, schistosomiasis, ascariasis,&#13;
&#13;
availability of land and suitable filter media, as well as     hookworm disease, hepatitis, and cholera. Operating&#13;
&#13;
the associated costs, compared with those of other             personnel must therefore wear the appropriate safety&#13;
&#13;
(technical) treatment options. So far, at the global level     items such as gloves and boots so that they avoid&#13;

for the entire system is described in the rest of this&#13;
section, based on experience drawn from O&amp;M of the&#13;
pilot plant in Masaya, Nicaragua, that serves about a&#13;

Central America&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Masaya, Nicaragua&#13;
&#13;
In 1996 the Austrian Development Agency introduced constructed wetland technology to Nicaragua by financing&#13;
the implementation of a SSHF constructed wetland system. Located in the outskirts of the city of Masaya,&#13;
Nicaragua, the system is treating the domestic wastewater (100 cubic meters per day) generated by some 1,000&#13;
people. The scheme comprises pretreatment (screen and grit tank), an Imhoff tank as the primary treatment unit,&#13;
and four constructed wetland beds fed in parallel. The area of each wetland bed is about 350 square meters,&#13;
totaling 1,400 square meters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The system was intensively monitored for nine consecutive years by a team of engineers from a consulting firm&#13;
and the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI). It served as a demonstration plant, and the investigations&#13;
carried out led to the determination of design criteria for local conditions. A variety of local plant species--such as&#13;
common reed (Phragmites australis); elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), a fodder crop typical of Central&#13;
America with high water and nitrogen demand; cattail (Typha domingensis); and reed canary grass (Phalaris&#13;
&#13;
arundinacea)--were planted on the surface. The&#13;
different types of filter media used, such as volcanic&#13;
gravel and rock, provided a large surface area for the&#13;
attached growth of microorganisms, adequate filtration&#13;
capacity, and high physical and chemical resistance.30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The quality of the treated domestic wastewater met the&#13;
national Nicaraguan standards for the discharge of&#13;
treated wastewater to the environment and for effluent&#13;
reuse except for thermotolerant coliforms. Table 3.1&#13;
compares the results of the rigorous monitoring with&#13;
the national standards for wastewater irrigation.              SSHF constructed wetland system at Masaya, Nicaragua.&#13;

Note: Data are based on six years of consecutive monitoring (1996­2002). Between three and eight random samples (12 hours)&#13;
were taken per year and analyzed in a recognized laboratory.&#13;
aApplied hydraulic surface loading ranged between 75 and 95 liters per square meter per day for the subsurface horizontal flow&#13;
 constructed wetland. The corresponding BOD and suspended solids (SS) areal loading rates are given in appendix B. The annual&#13;
                                              5&#13;
 average air temperature was 26.5°C, and wastewater temperatures ranged between 26 and 29°C.&#13;
bAccording to MARENA (2000).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following main conclusions can be drawn from the experience:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The SSHF constructed wetlands performs very efficiently in the removal of organic matter, suspended solids,&#13;
    and helminths, but is only moderately efficient in removing medium thermotolerant coliforms. Nutrients such as&#13;
    nitrogen and phosphorus are removed only to a minor extent.&#13;
    Filter material must be chosen carefully, avoiding fine fractions to prevent clogging. Every two to two and a half&#13;
    years on average, parts of the (volcanic) filter material just behind the inlet distribution zone becomes clogged&#13;
    and must be replaced.&#13;
    Stormwater runoff from heavy rainfalls must be prevented from entering the filterbeds to avoid the deposition of&#13;
    fine material on the wetland surface.&#13;
    Pollution loads of organic matter and suspended solids must be limited to guarantee the long-term treatment&#13;
    performance of the wetland without colmatation (see appendix B for applied and recommended loading rates).&#13;
     As a rule of thumb, 1.3­1.5 square meters of wetland surface per person equivalent is sufficient under&#13;
    Nicaraguan conditions.&#13;
    A well-trained operator can handle the plant. However, technical support is needed to empty sludge from the&#13;
    settlement tank and replace the clogged material.&#13;
    The system should be fenced off to avoid theft and entry of unauthorized persons.&#13;
    The treatment scheme does not cause unpleasant odors or provoke the proliferation of mosquitoes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Effluent from the pilot plant in Masaya was used to irrigate a variety&#13;
of crops in order to study the presence of pathogenic&#13;
microorganisms in the dry seasons of the years 1997­2002. The&#13;
concentration of nutrients in the effluent of the scheme enabled&#13;
crop development without the need for artificial fertilizers. The&#13;
studies demonstrated that the effluent did not affect the soil&#13;
structure, and it permitted irrigation of crops with medium salt&#13;
tolerance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The crop species investigated included species growing below the&#13;
surface such as onion, beetroot, manioc, and peanut; species in               Elephant grass used for cattle fodder in Nicaragua.&#13;
partial contact with the soil such as zucchini and cucumber; and              Source: Proyecto Astec, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
species growing close to the surface such as tomato, beans,&#13;
paprika, and fruit trees (papaya). In addition, elephant grass, a&#13;
plant used in Nicaragua as cattle fodder, was grown on the surface&#13;
of the constructed wetland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Irrigation trials were conducted to determine the microbiological&#13;
quality of the crops and crop yield, applying furrow irrigation during&#13;
the dry season, suspending irrigation at least one week before&#13;
harvesting, and washing crops with clean water prior to analysis as&#13;
additional safeguards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Microbiological contamination of the crops through the reuse of the&#13;
effluent varied according to the type of crop and its contact with the&#13;
soil or treated wastewater.31 In general, plants growing below the            Applying furrow irrigation at Masaya.&#13;
surface, such as onion and beetroot, had the highest level of fecal           Source: WSP, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
contamination. Peeling the crops greatly reduced pathogens on the&#13;
crop surface. Leaves of elephant grass grown on the surface of the&#13;
constructed wetland did not show any fecal contamination because&#13;
of the subsurface flow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Crops such as beans, sweet corn, and sugar cane produced yields&#13;
similar to those irrigated with well water and receiving applications&#13;
of chemical fertilizers. By contrast, yields of rice, paprika, and&#13;
tomato irrigated with the effluent of the constructed wetland were&#13;
poorer because of their higher nutrient demand. Finally, the&#13;
                                                                              Irrigated crops at Masaya, Nicaragua.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
              The following recommendations32 on health protection measures are drawn from the field experiences in Masaya:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   Restrict irrigation&#13;
                   - to crops that are cooked before eating such as beans, manioc, sweet corn, and rice, because the cooking&#13;
                      process deactivates the pathogens&#13;
                   - to industrial crops that undergo a drying, roasting, or extraction process such as sugar cane, peanuts, and&#13;
                      soybeans&#13;
                   - to high-growing crops such as fruit trees (for example, papaya and citrus--orange, lemon, mandarin,&#13;
                      grapefruit, etc.)&#13;
                   - to nonfood plants such as ornamental flowers, fodder plants, or bamboo, which can be used as&#13;
                      construction material.&#13;
                   Use nonsurface irrigation techniques such as low-cost drip irrigation systems to protect farmers and nearby&#13;
                   communities and to optimize the use of irrigation water.&#13;
                   Plant elephant grass as an alternative plant species on the surface of the constructed wetland. Elephant grass&#13;
                   has high growth rates, does not become contaminated because of the subsurface flow conditions, and can be&#13;
                   sold as cattle fodder.&#13;
                   Suspend irrigation at least one week before crop harvesting.&#13;
                   Ensure that workers avoid hand-to-mouth contact during farm work (such as during cigarette smoking).&#13;
                   Organize awareness campaigns that promote good hygiene, emphasizing handwashing with soap. Such&#13;
                   campaigns should accompany wastewater irrigation programs and target farmers and their families,&#13;

                   Urge responsible authorities to verify all the health protection measures applied and to certify crops from&#13;
                   hygienically safe production. However, because farmers often prefer to cultivate cash crops such as lettuce,&#13;
                   controlling and enforcing crop restriction might prove difficult.&#13;

&#13;
              As for sludge management, in Masaya septic sludge was removed periodically from the settling tank, discharged&#13;
              to a simple sludge drying bed, and left for sun drying for several months. The completely dry solids were then&#13;
              deposited under fruit trees on-site. Analysis of the pathogen concentrations in the dried sludge has not been&#13;
              conducted.&#13;

San José Las Flores, El Salvador&#13;
&#13;
San José Las Flores, a village in northeastern Chalatenango, El Salvador, is an outstanding example of&#13;
community participation in a sanitation project and community-based management of the sanitation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 1986, when the original settlers returned to their village after the civil war, gastrointestinal infections broke out,&#13;
killing many children. Poor sanitary conditions were mainly responsible for the outbreak. In response, the highly&#13;
organized and motivated inhabitants implemented a sanitation project with financial and technical support from&#13;
the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the local NGO Pro-Vida. The project included&#13;
community development, intensive hygiene promotion, construction of a sewerage system for the most densely&#13;
populated part of the village, home to126 families or about 650 persons, followed by construction of a wetland&#13;
system and on-site sanitation (latrines) for the remaining population. The community actively participated in the&#13;
implementation of the systems under the coordination of a local committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The social process of technology adoption. The project began in 1997 with the election of the Municipal Water and&#13;
Environmental Sanitation Committee. These community members promoted the project and defined and&#13;
organized community participation. Meanwhile, hygiene promoters, trained by the NGO, conducted door-to-door&#13;
visits and organized meetings to raise awareness and educate village inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community participation in key decisions such as the type and location of the treatment system empowered the&#13;
community to contribute actively to the sanitation project. The constructed wetland system proposed--and&#13;
eventually accepted by the community--was based on the experience of the pilot plant in neighboring Nicaragua.&#13;
Reasons for adopting the technology included its simple O&amp;M requirements and low recurrent costs, the&#13;
availability of construction materials, the stable treatment process, and the good treatment performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Treatment performance. The constructed wetland system in San José Las Flores was designed by the consulting&#13;
team at UNI in Nicaragua, using the parameters established at the Masaya pilot plant. As a result, the treatment&#13;
performance of the new system was that of the system in Nicaragua (see table 3.2). The effluent essentially meets&#13;
the national effluent standard of El Salvador, except for fecal coliforms, which would require additional retention&#13;
time (that is, a larger constructed wetland bed).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management of the treatment system and technical assistance for O&amp;M. The constructed wetland system has&#13;
been managed by the local committee, which appointed a plant operator. SDC covered O&amp;M costs for the system's&#13;
first two years of operation. Since then, tariffs have been collected from the community to pay the plant operator.&#13;
Experience from Masaya and from San José Las Flores indicate that the simple O&amp;M tasks do not require the&#13;
services of highly skilled technicians; rather, they can be carried out by a community member after adequate&#13;
&#13;

The successful operation and satisfactory performance of the pilot plant in Nicaragua encouraged dissemination&#13;
of the technology and led to the construction of several plants in the region, mainly for the treatment of domestic&#13;
and municipal wastewater (see table 3.3).34&#13;

&#13;
Constructed wetland schemes have increasingly come under examination for use for domestic wastewater and&#13;
grey water treatment in several South American countries. The following sections describe some applications of&#13;
such schemes in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. These descriptions are drawn from a recent regional study&#13;
commissioned by the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program from experiences presented during a workshop&#13;
in Lima in August 2007 and from the author's further research.&#13;

Lima, Peru&#13;
&#13;
After its experience with a pilot plant installed at the National University of Engineering, the government of Peru&#13;
installed three SSHF constructed wetland schemes in the arid outskirts of Peru's capital.35 The treatment systems,&#13;
finished in late 2006, were part of an overall water and sanitation project of the Ministry of Housing, Construction&#13;
and Sanitation at El Mirador­Pachacutec in Lima's Ventanilla district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Each constructed wetland scheme serves about 2,500&#13;
people and includes a manual screen, grit separators,&#13;
and sedimentation tanks as pretreatment steps for the&#13;
domestic wastewater before it enters the wetland, which&#13;
is composed of two units of the SSHF type. A covered&#13;
underground sludge storage tank with a perforated&#13;
bottom and side walls is provided for dewatering septic&#13;
sludge generated in the primary sedimentation tanks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All treatment schemes operate under gravity flow&#13;
conditions and are located between the settlement and&#13;
the coastline; the wetland sites are cut into the steep,       Constructed wetland units at Ventanilla, Lima.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
            As for treatment performance, the constructed wetland scheme removes more than 95 percent of organic conta-&#13;
            mination (in terms of BOD) and reduces the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms by 2­3 log units, according to&#13;
            recent analyses (see table 3.4). Compared with design assumptions about wastewater flow, the influent flow seemed&#13;
            to be low during a visit to the site in August 2007. This situation could explain the good pathogen removal.36&#13;
&#13;
            At the time this report was being prepared, the implementation of a simple irrigation system was under way, with the&#13;
            goal of reusing the treated effluent for reforestation purposes. Furthermore, the responsibility for operation and&#13;
            maintenance of the systems was being transferred to Lima's water utility, Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado&#13;
            de Lima (SEDAPAL), which also was handling O&amp;M of the condominial water and sewerage network of El Mirador­&#13;
            Pachacutec. SEDAPAL was planning to finance the required activities out of its annual O&amp;M budget for infrastructure&#13;
            maintenance. The users of the installed treatment plants were not being charged any fees for O&amp;M of the treatment&#13;
            schemes. The population has been sensitized, however, to the correct use of the (condominial) sewerage system,&#13;
            such as separating garbage and household chemicals, which will also contribute to trouble-free operation of the&#13;
            biological treatment system in the future. Awareness was raised among the users about the health and environmental&#13;
            benefits of the treatment plants in order to strengthen users' sense of responsibility and prevent vandalism.&#13;

            This experience in Lima will be an important reference for future projects, taking into account a holistic, decentralized&#13;
            concept providing water, access to networked sewerage, relatively small treatment plants, and effluent reuse in&#13;
            periurban settings. It remains to be seen whether SEDAPAL will be able to carry out O&amp;M activities as required,&#13;
            including sludge removal from the settlement tanks and the appropriate disposal of biosolids. Apart from wastewater&#13;
            treatment, the main function of the constructed wetlands, they act as green islands in the midst of the desert&#13;
            landscape of Peru's capital. Moreover, they provide a green barrier during windy weather, holding back sand blown&#13;
            from the coastline toward the settlement.&#13;
&#13;
            Scaling up constructed wetland schemes in Peru will require further investigations of the appropriate filter media&#13;
            available in different locations of the country, along with detailed performance data on the described system.&#13;

Pereira, Colombia&#13;
&#13;
Much like in Peru, a university spearheaded development of constructed wetland technology in Colombia, starting&#13;
with small-scale laboratory investigations. Experiences gained in the laboratory trials were then applied by a team&#13;
of enthusiastic staff at the Universidad Técnica de Pereira (UTP), Pereira's technical university, at the existing&#13;
wastewater treatment plant, "La Florida," as part of a sanitation project to mitigate the negative environmental&#13;
impacts on the Otún river basin. The system of "La Florida" originally consisted of a pretreatment unit and a&#13;
combination of a septic tank and anaerobic filter, treating wastewater arising from a nearby small community (see&#13;
figure 3.1). But the efficiency of the system was low, possibly because groundwater infiltration of the sewerage&#13;
system diluted the wastewater, resulting in low influent concentrations of several contaminants.37 According to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UTP, this phenomenon occurs quite often in                  Figure 3.1 Layout of Treatment Scheme, "La Florida," Pereira, Colombia&#13;

the system did not comply with Colombian&#13;
legislation, which calls for more than 80&#13;

&#13;
Among other rehabilitation measures, several&#13;
SSHF constructed wetland units were added&#13;
as tertiary treatment units and operated in                         PRETREATMENT&#13;
parallel to resolve the problem. Different filter&#13;
media and local plant types also were selected&#13;
for the constructed wetlands, which then were&#13;
operated under relatively high organic loading&#13;
rates38 and short retention times (less than one&#13;
day). Careful monitoring revealed that&#13;
constructed wetland units with fine sand (0.3&#13;
millimeters) as filter media initially performed&#13;
well in removing organic pollutants (50­70                  Source: Adapted from Villegas Gómez et al. (2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37According to data provided by Villegas Gómez et al. (2006) and the author's calculation, about 280 persons are connected to the treatment&#13;
  plant, producing a flow of 1.85 liters per second (160 cubic meters per day), which translates into a theoretic daily wastewater production of 570&#13;
  liters per capita.&#13;
38Approximately 11.5­15 grams of BOD per square meter per day (115­150 kilograms per hectare per day). For further details, see Villegas&#13;

               percent) and bacteria (up to 2 log units of fecal coliforms). However, they quickly clogged up, resulting in surface&#13;
               flow. The constructed wetland units with gravel as filter media had lower removal performance in terms of organic&#13;
               contamination, but did not present operational problems.39&#13;

               Pasto, Colombia&#13;
&#13;
               The SSHF constructed wetland system in Pasto, a municipality in southern Colombia, was implemented in 2006&#13;
               through a joint effort of the municipality, the local utility EMPOPASTO, and the NGO Semillero de Sueños (see&#13;
               table 3.5). The wetland scheme, which was constructed with engineering assistance from a Colombian university,&#13;
               comprises various pretreatment and primary treatment units, followed by a single relatively small constructed&#13;
               wetland. According to the NGO, the treatment system is designed to receive the wastewater of about 1,000&#13;
               inhabitants of a nearby community. The filter material is composed of fine gravel and organic soil. The local&#13;
               community is using the treated effluent for crop production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The NGO, which also relies on the services of professional sanitary engineers, carried out important social work&#13;
               with the population. Activities included participatory analysis of priorities to achieve better health and&#13;
               environmental protection, consultation with community leaders, hygiene promotion, and environmental education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39As stated earlier, selection of the appropriate filter media and application of a&#13;
  limited hydraulic loading rate are key to avoid clogging, a primary cause of&#13;
  collapse of constructed wetlands. See the recommended loading areal&#13;
  loading rates in appendix B.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
aimed at achieving a high degree of community ownership, as well as effective management of the plant by&#13;
community members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Much like in San José Las Flores in El Salvador, the social intervention of the NGO has produced very positive&#13;
results in terms of "empowering" the local population to take care of the plant and to consider the treated effluent&#13;
as a valuable resource for crop production. It is therefore highly recommended that community mobilization be a&#13;
component of constructed wetland projects for community-based systems. It is also important to consider the cost&#13;
of social interventions in the planning phase of the project.&#13;

               Santa Catarina State, Brazil&#13;
&#13;
               Several small constructed wetland projects have been implemented since 1990 in the state of Santa Catarina in&#13;
               southeastern Brazil. SSHF constructed wetland schemes have been installed predominantly in rural settings as a&#13;
               decentralized wastewater treatment option for a variety of institutions.&#13;

               implementing several constructed wetlands at the state company's own training centers. The SSHF constructed&#13;
               wetland treatment schemes (Agronômica, Videira, Tubarão, and São Joaquim), which use septic tanks as primary&#13;
               treatment, were designed for a population of 50­150 persons. Coarse sand is used as filter media, and the&#13;
               wetlands are planted with a local wetland plant and operated under subtropical climate conditions by EPAGRI&#13;
               staff (Philippi et al. 2006). Clogging was reported for the Videira system after four years of operation. The average&#13;
               contaminant removal performance of the constructed wetland units are shown in table 3.6. The effluent of some of&#13;
               the systems receives further treatment in stabilization ponds and is used for aquaculture (fish farming).&#13;

Alagoinhas, Brazil&#13;
&#13;
The city of Alagoinhas, located about 150 kilometers north of Salavador in Brazil's tropical state of Bahía, has had&#13;
some interesting and successful experiences in improving sanitation services through participatory approaches. In&#13;
2001 the first municipal conference on environmental sanitation, an initiative led by the local mayor, resulted in the&#13;
development of the municipal policy for environmental sanitation. The policy called for creating a municipal&#13;
sanitation plan, which was drafted with the technical assistance of the Federal University of Bahia within one year,&#13;
following other successful examples from neighboring municipalities. The plan was developed in a participatory&#13;
way, engaging civil society and other stakeholders in monthly public review meetings. The development of the&#13;
environmental sanitation policy and the plan resulted in the implementation of various sanitation projects.41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2001 Serviço Autônomo de Água e Esgoto de Alagoinhas (SAAE), Alagoinhas's water and sanitation utility,&#13;
initiated interventions in periurban areas, where sanitary conditions were worst. With the goal of improving health&#13;
and environmental conditions in the city, SAAE implemented a series of condominial sewerage projects, replacing&#13;
septic tanks that conveyed effluents to the stormwater drainage system and capturing household wastewater&#13;
directly discharged to the streets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Among the possible solutions for reducing the&#13;
pollutant load in water bodies, constructed wetlands&#13;
were identified as a natural treatment system, drawing&#13;
on experiences with the systems designed by staff of&#13;
Santa Catarina's universities. Because of the relatively&#13;
simple construction and O&amp;M activities required for&#13;
such systems, SAAE decided to implement a&#13;
constructed wetland as a biological treatment unit after&#13;
a grit removal tank and an anaerobic reactor42 in the&#13;
barrio of Jardim Petrolar Alagoinhas (Castro Reis et al.&#13;
undated). The plant was designed for a population of&#13;
about 2,500. A summary of project parameters appears&#13;
in table 3.7 and of the average removal performance of&#13;
wastewater contaminants in table 3.8. According to the&#13;
analyses provided, suspended solids and pathogenic            Constructed wetland system at Jardim Petrolar, Alagoinhas,&#13;

bacteria were removed only to a limited extent, which&#13;
could be a consequence of both the high hydraulic&#13;
surface load applied and the very coarse filter media.&#13;
The constructed wetland unit therefore predominantly&#13;
reduced organic pollution, but levels of fecal&#13;
contamination remained almost the same in the&#13;
effluent of the plant. Thus the treatment system is&#13;
contributing to environmental protection, but is not          41 For more information, see http://www.tni.org/docs/200701251751082475.pdf.&#13;

4. Lessons learned and conclusions&#13;

&#13;
Experiences with constructed wetland technology in                 Technical assistance is required for community-&#13;
several countries of Central and South America over                managed systems.&#13;

The main limitations of constructed wetland                   Design and construction are not to be taken easily:&#13;
technology, particularly of the subsurface horizontal&#13;
flow type, are the following:                                      Constructed wetland systems should be designed&#13;

&#13;
The following sections contain general design recommendations for SSHF constructed wetlands and design parameters as&#13;
investigated at the constructed wetland at Masaya, Nicaragua (Platzer et al. 2002; Proyecto Astec 2005).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. General design recommendations for SSHF constructed wetland (Brix and Arias 2007; H. Brix, personal&#13;
   communication, 2007)&#13;
&#13;
   Wastewater flow must pass through the constructed wetland system without overland flow or flooding.43&#13;
   Operation should remain feasible in the likely event of changing hydraulic conductivity (partial colmatation).&#13;
   The constructed wetland shall be both drainable and floodable.&#13;
   Water levels within the system should be fully controllable through the use of inlet and outlet structures.&#13;
   The configuration must be adapted to the site in terms of project boundaries and hydraulic profiles.&#13;
   The recommended maximum difference in elevation between inlet and outlet water level is 0.3 meters.&#13;
   A bottom slope of about 1 percent is appropriate.&#13;
   At least two units should be installed.&#13;
   Large systems must be subdivided into several units to allow control of water flow and to avoid short-circuiting, according&#13;
   to the following recommendations:&#13;
   -    The width of a constructed wetland should be limited to 20 meters to allow even water distribution across the entire&#13;
        width.The inlet channel should be subdivided, with separate water loading for wider units.&#13;
   -    The maximum length of systems with a bottom slope of 1 percent should be limited to 30 meters to allow controlled&#13;
        flooding of the system (for example, for weed control, good plant growth, balancing fluctuations of flow rate).&#13;
   The recommended depth of the constructed wetland units is 60­80 centimeters.&#13;
   Coarse sand or gravel should be used as filter material with the following characteristics44:&#13;
   -    d &gt; 0.3 millimeters&#13;

3. Areal loading rates applied in Nicaragua&#13;
&#13;
The areal loading rates (ALRs) of specific pollutants (grams per square meter per day) are calculated by multiplying the influent&#13;
flow rate (cubic meters per day) by the respective influent pollutant concentration (milligrams per liter equal grams per cubic&#13;
meter) and dividing by the surface area (square meters) of the SSHF constructed wetland (USEPA 1999).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The BOD ALR and the suspended solids ALR are especially important in relation to the clogging of the SSHF constructed&#13;
           5&#13;
wetlands, because accumulating (bio-) solids can lead to colmatation.The following ranges and upper limits for these loading&#13;
rates have been applied in Masaya, Nicaragua, to avoid frequent clogging.They are relatively conservative values that&#13;
guarantee the long-term contaminant removal efficiencies stated in table 2.1 of this report. Replacement of clogged filter media&#13;
is a critical and often neglected O&amp;M activity, leading to unwanted surface flow conditions.Areal loading rates higher than the&#13;
ones that follow could result in more frequent clogging of the filter media:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BOD areal loading rate: 6­8 grams BOD per square meter per day&#13;
           5                                   5&#13;
    SS areal loading rate:       4­6 grams SS per square meter per day&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In both cases, the higher values refer to applications in tropical areas with high wastewater temperatures such as Central&#13;
America.The values essentially match the recommendations in the international literature (USEPA 1999;García et al.2002;&#13;
Bécares 2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  48&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The areal loading rates just given can also be used to estimate the required area of the constructed wetland, if the maximum&#13;
daily flow rate and average pollutant concentrations in the influent of the constructed wetland (that is, after the primary&#13;
treatment unit) are known or estimated. In view of the existence of two criteria (BOD and SS ALR), the more conservative&#13;
                                                                                      5&#13;
value (that is, the larger surface area) must be selected--see USEPA (1999) for more information.&#13;

6. Degradation constants determined for the Masaya pilot plant&#13;
&#13;
The model based on first-order kinetics and plug flow conditions, usually used to estimate effluent quality for certain inlet&#13;
concentrations of different pollutants under certain hydraulic loading rates, gives good results for organic contaminants in terms&#13;
of BOD and COD.The area-specific degradation constants k can be calculated using the following formula (Vymazal et al.&#13;
         5&#13;
1998):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
k = qA * (ln Ci ­ ln Cout)&#13;
&#13;
k        area-specific degradation constant (meters per year)&#13;
qA       hydraulic loading rate (meters per year)&#13;
Ci       inlet concentration of the contaminant (milligrams per liter)&#13;
Cout     outlet concentration of the contaminant (milligrams per liter)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Under the conditions (1­5) just described, the empirically determined degradation constants k (mean ± 95 percent confidence&#13;
limit) for BOD, COD, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were as follows (Platzer et al.2002):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    kBOD         81.8 ± 13 meters per year&#13;
    kCOD         60.8 ± 12 meters per year&#13;
    kTN 11.8 ± 6 meters per year&#13;
    kTP 6.9 ± 4 meters per year&#13;
    kSS 61.0 ± 18 meters per year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, it is essential to note that these constants have been determined under the given site-specific conditions, which,&#13;
apart from air and wastewater temperatures, also take into account characteristics of the filter material used and specific flow&#13;
characteristics, which are inherent to each constructed wetland.The rate constants can vary substantially between different&#13;
systems.&#13;

            Constructed wetlands : a promising
            wastewater treatment system for small localities -
            experiences from Latin America
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report provides an overview of how
            constructed wetlands serve as natural wastewater treatment
            systems. It focuses especially on the subsurface horizontal
            flow type-a technology that has high potential for small and
            medium-size communities because of its simplicity,
            performance reliability, and low operation and maintenance
            requirements. The ability of this wetland to reduce
            pathogens renders the effluent suitable for irrigation of
            certain crop species if additional health and environmental
            protection measures are taken. This report describes several
            experiences with constructed wetland schemes in Central and
            South America: a full-scale pilot plant in Nicaragua, a
            community-managed constructed wetland scheme in El Salvador,
            and other systems in Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Although
            the report focuses on technology issues, it stresses the
            importance of adequate arrangements for operation and
            maintains to guarantee the long-term treatment performance
            of the constructed wetland scheme. Furthermore, community
            participation and complementary actions such as promoting
            hygiene are crucial elements for sustainable wastewater
            treatment projects and maximization of health and
            environmental benefits.
