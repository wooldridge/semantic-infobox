I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
A. Territory andSector Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Global Program for Avian Influenza(GPAI)' outlines indetail the magnitude&#13;
and nature o f the threat posedby Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) globally&#13;
and inthe Europe and Central Asia region. Although there have been no diagnosed cases&#13;
inKosovo' neighboringcountries experienced confirmedoutbreaks o fHPAIeither in&#13;
wild birdsor among domestically reared poultry inthe first halfo f 2006.3 The&#13;
vulnerability o fthe region to outbreaks and the difficulty o fpreventingspread of the&#13;
disease across boundaries create significant concerns regarding KOSOVO'S                   vulnerabilityto&#13;
HPAI outbreaks among wild birds or domestic poultry. The potential consequences o f an&#13;
undetected or unchecked outbreak include transmissiono f the virus to humans and/or the&#13;
emergence of a virus transmissible between human^.^&#13;
&#13;
2.        KOSOVO'S populationwas estimated at 2.6 millioninlate 2005.5The vast&#13;
                      poultry&#13;
majority o fpoultry are layers (96 percent o f Kosovo's poultry meat is imported).6Around&#13;
75 percent of poultry is reared free-range on roughly 113,000 small household farms in&#13;
rural areas; thus around halfofrural households ownpoultry, with an average o f 19 heads&#13;
per farm. The remainder o fKosovo's poultry population is reared inindustrial poultry&#13;
farms for eggproduction. OfKosovo's estimated 2 millionpeople, roughly 1.3 million&#13;
live inrural areas and potentially stand to be exposed to risk o f infection from infected&#13;
poultry.KOSOVO'S       veterinary services, under the Kosovo Veterinary and FoodAgency&#13;
(KVFA), are relatively organized, butbothpublic andprivate services are poorly&#13;
resourced.&#13;
&#13;
3.        KOSOVO'S    Provisional Lnstitutions o f Self-Government (PISG), with the support o f&#13;
the internationaldonor community, since late 2005 have focused onmountingarapid&#13;
response to improve surveillance, detection and containment measures. A PISG decision&#13;
of October 28,2005, endowed the Office o fthe Prime Minister with the role o f&#13;
overseeing overall preparedness and planning, while the implementingand executive&#13;
authority for HPAIpreparedness and response activities has been vested inthe relevant&#13;
&#13;
' The Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparednessand Response: GPAI&#13;
program framework document (GPAI PAD) presents the overall framework for World Bank support to&#13;
client countries to address the challenges posed by the avian influenza and the possibility o f a human flu&#13;
pandemic. More details and the document can be found at www.worldbank.org.&#13;
 Kosovo is currently under the administration o fthe UnitedNations Interim Administration Missionin&#13;
Kosovo (UNMIK)under the terms o f UNSecurity Council Resolution 1244 (1999).&#13;
 Most Balkancountries have confirmed outbreaks: Albania inbackyard poultry; Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
inwild swans; Bulgaria inwild birds; Croatia inwild swans; Serbia andMontenegro inwildbirdsand&#13;
backyard poultry; and Romania inpoultry (Source: World Bank, Avian Influenza ECA Country Overview).&#13;
  See GPAI PAD p.1-3.&#13;
 Informationabout the poultry sector tends to vary by source. Inaddition poultry numbers vary by season,&#13;
and are reported to have undergone a contraction since late 2005 as a result o f the spring 2006 outbreaks o f&#13;
HPAI among poultry across the region. Figures here are from "Series 2: Agriculture and Environment&#13;

&#13;
line Ministries, inparticular the Ministry o fAgriculture, Forestry and RuralDevelopment&#13;
(MAFRD)for AnimalHealthaspectsofthe response, andMinistryofHealth(MOH) for&#13;
human health.' An Avian Influenza Working Group has been established, chaired by the&#13;
DeputyMinister ofAgriculture and sitting inMAFRD.The Working Group comprises&#13;
MAFRD,the MOH, InstituteofPublic Health(IPH), the MinistryofPublic Services&#13;
(Departmentof Emergency Management), the Kosovo Police Services, and the Kosovo&#13;
Protection Corps and other key emergency services. With the assistance o fthe World&#13;
Health Organization (WHO), the UnitedNations InterimAdministration Mission in&#13;
Kosovo (UNMIK),UNDP, FA0 andother agencies KOSOVO'S                    PISGhave produced three&#13;
territory-wide plans related to HPAI: the "Action Plan for the Preventiono f Influenza&#13;
Pandemic" preparedby the M O H inFebruary 2006; the "Operational Plan on Fighting&#13;
and Eradicating Avian Influenza" prepared by the Department o f Emergency&#13;
Management (DEM)under the Ministry o f Public Services; and, the "Operational Plan&#13;
for Zones Infected with Avian Influenza" preparedby MAFRD. Amongst other actions&#13;
the KVFAbannedtrade inpoultry duringthe 2006 outbreaks inneighboring countries.&#13;
The MOH i s establishing regional and municipalAI commissions' (for human public&#13;
health), and several simulations havebeen heldto helpprepare for a human pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Notwithstanding the work that has been carried out to date, there is an urgent need&#13;
to improveand scale up KOSOVO'S to prevent, identify, contain and eradicate&#13;
                                          capacity&#13;
H P A Ioutbreaks, and deal with a potential pandemic shouldthis contingency develop.&#13;
Needs include institutional strengthening, capacity-building, increasing public awareness,&#13;
and increased resources (including, potentially, the need for compensation funds). To&#13;
address these needs the PISGhave requested World Bank financing for its efforts.&#13;
Kosovo meets the financingeligibility and criteria for the GPAI, has demonstrated its&#13;
commitment and has an appropriate program o f rapid response, detection and&#13;
containment measures, including appropriate implementation and monitoring&#13;
arrangements that the international agencies anddonor community, including the Bank,&#13;
can support.g&#13;
&#13;
B. Rationalefor BankInvolvementandPartnershipArrangements&#13;
&#13;
5.      This project will bringimportant benefits inthe areas o f strengthening veterinary&#13;
and public health services andmitigating the social and economic fallout o f a potential&#13;
influenza pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The WHO, FAO, UNDP and UNICEFhave taken the lead inhelping Kosovo&#13;
prepared for a potential HPAIoutbreak, while UNMIKhas assisted the PISGwith&#13;
preparingtheir response. These agencies have responded to some o f the most critical&#13;
needs that have been identified, for example assisting the PISGwith coordination and&#13;
planning(includingsimulation exercises), and have laidcritical groundwork inassessing&#13;
the PISG's preparedness and recommending areas for improvement (see details in&#13;
Section I. The EUis also providing important assistance inlaboratory design and&#13;
            A.).&#13;

constructionthat will assist with surveillance and diagnosis o f AI as well as other&#13;
diseases.&#13;
&#13;
7.     The project laid out inthis Project Technical Annex (replacing the Project&#13;
Appraisal Document for GPAIprojects) builds on the work o f these agencies. The World&#13;
Bank anticipates that these UNagencies will continue to take the leadinproviding&#13;
technical assistance, including inareas assessedto have critical risks interms o f access&#13;
and coordination with minority communities. However, the scale o f the response that i s&#13;
needed to prevent, contain and eradicate avian influenza outbreaks, and prevent&#13;
transmission to humans, requires mobilization o f financial resources beyond the mandate&#13;
and means o f these organizations, and well beyond the PISG's resources. The World&#13;
Bank is able to bring critical assistance to these efforts inthe form o f financing inan IDA&#13;
grant. The World Bank also brings experience o f assisting other countries under the&#13;
GPAIumbrella. The Bank is able to bringvaluable lessons learned from other countries&#13;
facing similar threats and insimilar operating environments. It also has important&#13;
operational experience inmounting emergency response grant financing; and in&#13;
integrating and coordinating the ongoing efforts o f other agencies into an integratedPISG&#13;
response.&#13;
&#13;
11.    PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
A. ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveand Key Indicators&#13;
&#13;
8.     The project development objective i s to strengthen the PISG's capacity to prevent&#13;
the spread o f avian influenza amongpoultry, to prevent the transmission o f avian&#13;
influenza from birdsto other animals and humans, and to prepare for a potential&#13;
pandemic o f avian influenza transmissible between humans.&#13;
&#13;
9.     The keyproject outcome indicators will be:&#13;
&#13;
       With regardto PublicAwareness andInformation:&#13;
           Targeted population (poultryproducers, veterinary and health personnel) and&#13;
           general population are aware o f the HPAIthreat and practice measures to&#13;
           protect themselves and others from HPAI(baseline survey to be conducted at&#13;
           beginningo fproject).&#13;
&#13;
       With regardto AnimalHealth,measures are inplace suchthat ifthere is an&#13;
       outbreak o fHPAIamong poultry:&#13;
           Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory identifies the presence o f HPAI;&#13;
           The PISGcullbirds at the infection point and establish a protection zone, with&#13;
           participation o f local governments and the population;&#13;
           The PISGcompensate farmers for culled birdsina timely manner.&#13;
&#13;
       With regard to HumanHealth,measures are inplace such that ifthere i s an&#13;
       HPAIoutbreak amonghumans:&#13;
       0   Infection is diagnosed and contained&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Patients receive appropriate treatment for HPAIinfection&#13;
&#13;
B. ProjectFinancingInstrumentand ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
10.      The project comes underthe GPAI discussed bythe Board onJanuary 12,2006.&#13;

&#13;
Component1.PublicAwarenessandInformation(US$283,500equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
11.      This component will help develop and implementa communications policy to&#13;
inform the public, particularly those more likely to be exposedto HPAI, about the threat&#13;
o f HPAIand how they can minimize the risk o f transmission and spread o f disease.&#13;
&#13;
12.      The first subcomponent will support Risk Communication to the population by&#13;
identifying mechanisms for communication on the HPAIsituation, and establishing and&#13;
maintainingproductive working relationship with all levels o fpopulation and the media&#13;
inpropagating essential andconsistent information relatingto HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The second subcomponent will focus on Communication for Behavior Change.&#13;
Keymessagesand materialswill be developed and disseminated for different audiences,&#13;
incommunitylanguages,particularlytargetingkeyhigh-risk groups, such as poultry&#13;
producers and children inareas where probability o f exposure is high. This&#13;
subcomponent will also support capacity development for interpersonalcommunication&#13;
(IPC) and communication for behavior change targetingcommunication working groups&#13;
at all levels, media, health and veterinary professionals, teachers and community groups&#13;
(NGOs, youth organizations, community leaders). Monitoringand evaluation o f the&#13;
communication component will be supported by rapid assessmentsand evaluations, focus&#13;
groups andother qualitative methods. A Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAF')&#13;
survey will be conducted at the beginningo f the project and at the end o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The component has been developedinclose coordination with UNICEF, the lead&#13;

short and long term HPAIprevention, containment, and control and eradication activities&#13;
inanimals. Thiswill comprise three subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
16.      The first subcomponent will Enhance HPAIPrevention and Preparedness&#13;
Capability. It will strengthenKOSOVO~S    policy and regulatory environment for veterinary&#13;
service and inspection, and will also support improved HPAIpreventionand control&#13;
planning.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.     The second subcomponent will Strengthen Disease Control Capacities, and&#13;
Improve Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities and Applied Research. It will strengthen&#13;
veterinary epidemiological surveillance through the creation o f a Veterinary&#13;
EpidemiologicalUnit (VEU). Territory-wide diagnostic capacities and bio-safety&#13;
protocols will be strengthened at the Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory, and animal disease&#13;
information systems will also be improved. The AI laboratory will be constructed to the&#13;
relevant bio-security level (2+).&#13;
&#13;
18.     The third subcomponent will focus on Strengthening HPAIControl Programs and&#13;
Outbreak Containment Programs. It will target virus eradication at the source through&#13;
culling, disinfection and disposal o f infected and at-risk poultry, and control o f movement&#13;
o fbirds.This will be achieved with the provision o fproper mobile culling, rendering and&#13;
disinfection equipment. The third subcomponent will also include a CompensationFund&#13;
o fUS$537,300 equivalent to support the PISG incompensating farmers for culled&#13;
livestock.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3. Human Health (US$968,500 equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
19.     This component will support a national programto develop and implement short&#13;
and mediumterm prevention o f an outbreak o f HPAIamong humans and reduce the&#13;
impact o f a pandemic virus. It will comprise three subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
20.     The first subcomponent will Enhance Coordination andProgram Planning, by: (i)&#13;
strengthening intra-sectoral command and sector coordination mechanisms; (ii)&#13;

between Pristina and the parallel system inthe North o f Kosovo; (v) developing a&#13;
detailed implementationplanfor "social distancing" measures inthe case o f an epidemic;&#13;
(vi) preparing the training program; and (vii) conductingregular simulation exercises.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The second subcomponent will Strengthen the Public Surveillance System by: (i)&#13;
establishing an active influenza surveillance system and strengthening the capacity o f the&#13;
IPHand regional epidemiological investigationandresponse teams; and (ii)         establishing&#13;
an Influenza Laboratory and providing equipment, kits and reagents and PPE, and the&#13;
trainingretraining o f laboratory staff.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The third subcomponent will Strengthen Health Care Response Capacity, by&#13;
strengthening the capacity o f medical services to isolate and treat patients with severe&#13;
communicable diseases, supporting the purchase and distribution o f anti-viral drugs and&#13;
developing effective guidelines for their use, and expanding immunization against&#13;
seasonal flu for staff and population at risk.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Component4. ProjectImplementationandMonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
 (US$276,100 equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
 23.     Though existing capacity will be used as much as possible to implement the&#13;
 project and form the Project Team (PT), this component will support and complement&#13;
 these capacities for effective implementation and management o f the project. It will&#13;
 comprise the following subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
 24.     The first subcomponent will Provide Support to the Project Team through&#13;
 strengthening capacities o f existing staff assigned to the project through training,&#13;
 providing additional staff for coordination, financial management, procurement and&#13;
 monitoring and evaluation, and supporting costs associated with project management and&#13;
 coordination, including consumables and audit and operational review requirements.&#13;

 training staff inM&amp;E techniques, planning and implementation; and supporting program&#13;
 monitoring and impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
111.     IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
 A. InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
 26.     The Project will be implementedby existing governmental institutions, inline&#13;
 with the existing PISGplan for implementation o fHPAIpreparedness andresponse&#13;
 measures. The focal point for project coordination will be the lead agency inMAFRD,&#13;
 the KVFA, which will assume responsibility for financial management and procurement&#13;
 functions for components implementedbyboth MAFRD and MOH. For project&#13;
 implementation the two main agencies will be MAFRDand MOH, and their related&#13;
 central and regional offices. Other governmental agencies andNGOs and service&#13;
 providers (including relevant Ministries, agencies like private veterinarians and&#13;
 community-based organizations, and government institutions at the regional and&#13;
 municipal level) will also be involved inthe delivery o f a variety o f services. The project&#13;
 will be managed by existing staff apart from the hiringo fone financial management&#13;
 specialist and local and international procurement expertise (financed by the project&#13;
 under Component 4)and the hiringo f epidemiological staff for implementation o f the&#13;
 Animal Health component (financed by the project under Component 2).&#13;
&#13;
 27.     In linewith the PISG's legislative framework for AIpreparedness, executive&#13;
 responsibility for AI preparedness will be with the Government AI Working Group&#13;
 (GAIWG), which sits in, and is headedby, the MAFRD,with inter-ministerial&#13;
 membershipfrom the appropriate ministries. The Office o fthe PrimeMinisterhas a&#13;
 coordinating andplanningrole and i s fully informed o f the GAIWG's activities. The&#13;
 GAIWGwill continue to sit andmeet on a regular basis, andwill report to the Office o f&#13;
 the Prime Minister/Council o f Ministers as necessary, and at least once a month, on&#13;
 developments related to the project, to the HPAIsituation inKosovo and inthe region,&#13;
 etc.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.      Giventhat MAFRDheadsthis working group, MAFRDwill also beresponsible&#13;
for project coordination, with the lead agency inMAFRDbeingthe KVFA. The Chief&#13;
Executive Officer ofthe KFVA has two responsibilities regarding the project: he has&#13;
been assigned as LeadProject Coordinator to coordinate the overall project, and is also&#13;
responsible for implementation o f the Animal Health component (Component 2). This&#13;
Lead Project Coordinator will be supported inhis day-to-day project coordination and&#13;
management responsibilitiesby one o f the seven epidemiologists being financed by the&#13;
project, who will be assigned the role o f Deputy Project Coordinator. A second o f these&#13;
seven epidemiologists will be assigned responsibility for project Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation (see below). These two epidemiologists will perform these project support&#13;
roles for the majority o f their time for the duration o f the project, after which their&#13;
epidemiological duties will become more important. The Lead Project Coordinator and&#13;
hisDeputy willprepare Annual Work Programsfor project implementation and the&#13;
Animal Health component; submitting inputs to the Project's quarterly and annual&#13;
financial monitoring reports andprogress reports; and other duties as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
29.      Project Coordinators for specific components have also been assigned, sitting in&#13;
the relevant line ministries. As stated above, the LeadProject Coordinator also has&#13;
responsibilities for Animal Health (Component 2). The Director of the Department o f&#13;
Epidemiology inKOSOVO'Shas been assigned as Project Coordinator for Human&#13;
                             IPH&#13;
Health(Component 3), while a Project Coordinator for Public Awareness and&#13;
Information Campaign (Component 1) has also beenassigned inthe IPH. For their duties&#13;
related to the World Bank project they will report to, and receive support from, the Lead&#13;
Project Coordinator, inaddition to their usualreporting lines intheir own agencies. The&#13;
Chief o f Animal Health inthe KVFA will be responsible for implementing the&#13;
CompensationFund, with support from project Financial Management and Procurement&#13;
staff as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Together the Lead Project Coordinator, the two Project Coordinators, the two&#13;
epidemiologists andthe procurement and financial management staff will constitute the&#13;
Project Team (see organigram inAppendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
31.      The Project Coordinator for each technical component (1. Public Awareness and&#13;
Information, 2. Animal Health and 3. HumanHealth) will be responsible for&#13;
implementinghis or her respective Component, including preparing Annual Work&#13;
Programs intheir sectors; monitoring and collecting relevant data and compiling them&#13;
into progress reports, focusing on the status o fphysical implementation, use o fproject&#13;
funds andmonitoring indicators for their component; supporting the Lead andDeputy&#13;
Project Coordinators inthe quarterly and annual financial monitoring reports as necessary&#13;
for their component; and coordinating component activities with the staff and&#13;
departments inthe Ministries involved (dependingon the nature o f the Component this&#13;
might require the involvement o fseveral Ministries, for example Ministry o f&#13;
Environment,Ministry o f Educationetc). The LeadProject Coordinator, his Deputy and&#13;
the Project Coordinators for the components will meet on a frequent and regular basis to&#13;
ensure integration and effective implementation o fproject activities, and the Lead Project&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coordinator will have overall responsibility for ensuring that there i s sufficient&#13;
coordination between different components. Government institutions at the regional and&#13;
municipal levels will be utilized and involved as much as possible.&#13;
&#13;
32.       Inminorityenclaves where the PISGisnot able to fully operate, WHO and&#13;
UNICEFwill assist with project implementation. Bothorganizations have extensive&#13;
experience inoperating inthese areas as well as inthe rest o fKosovo. They also have&#13;
appropriate technical capacities.&#13;
&#13;
33.       The Project Team will coordinate and collaborate as necessary intheir planning&#13;
and implementation activities and inupdating the preparedness plan with the UNHPAI&#13;
Coordinator sittinginthe Office o f Public Safety (OPS), Office o f the PrimeMinister."&#13;
&#13;
34.       Procurementexpertisewill beprovided by a local consultant to behired, using&#13;
project funds, for the duration o f the project and to sit inthe KVFA with the Lead Project&#13;
Coordinator and the rest o f the project team. This individual will be supported by existing&#13;
capacity inPublic Procurement Agency (reporting to the Council o fMinisters); and by an&#13;
international procurement consultant to be hiredinitially for two months duringthe first&#13;
year o f the project to assist duringthe most intensive period o fprocurement activity.&#13;
Further expertise, including technical expertise indrafting specifications, will come from&#13;
procurement expertise inthe KVFA.&#13;
&#13;
35.       As the focal point for project coordination, the KVFA, incollaboration with the&#13;
Grant Unit at the MFE, will assume responsibility for financialmanagementfunctions&#13;
for components implementedbyboth MAFRD and MOH. A qualified financial&#13;
management consultant will be hired, usingproject funds, to consolidate the annual Work&#13;
Programs and budgets, to consolidate quarterly financial management reporting and&#13;
progress reports, and to administer the Compensation Fund.An action is required to&#13;
ensure that arrangements are fully satisfactory for the project, with its specific FMneeds,&#13;
especially with respect to the CompensationFund. Satisfactory implementation o fthe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loThis UNHPAI Coordinator is a position establisheduponjoint initiative and co-sharing o f UNDP,&#13;
WHO, UNICEF,FA0 and the Office o fthe UNDevelopment Coordinator. The HPAICoordinator is&#13;
tasked to assist the PISG infinalising an integrated "KOSOVO  H P A I Pandemic Preparedness &amp; Contingency&#13;
Plan" as per the outline already inplace, which will incorporate plans already approved by the PISG&#13;
(Action Plan for the Prevention o f InfluenzaPandemic" by the Ministry o f Health; the "Operational Plan on&#13;
Fightingand Eradicating Avian Influenza" by the Department o fEmergency Management (DEM)andthe&#13;
"Operational Plan for Zones infectedwith Avian Influenza" by the Ministry o f Agriculture, Forestry and&#13;
Rural Development). The Coordinator will ensure that adequate planning and preparedness measures&#13;
envisagedby the plan are undertaken both at central and local levels; ensure the establishment o f a working&#13;
coordination mechanism between central and local levels; organize the assigned work insuch a way that&#13;
plans are builtaround several scenarios and can be adjusted according to the evolution of science and&#13;
knowledge as well as to the assessed riskfor a pandemic; ensure harmonization between the "Kosovo&#13;
Human Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan" and other plans prepared by countries inthe region; link&#13;
with regionalinstitutions and civil society organizations involved inpandemic preparedness andplanning;&#13;
identify areas where UNAgencies can provide support as per their area o f expertise; informthe UN&#13;
Development Coordinator and the other UNAgencies monthly on the developments; and performother&#13;
duties as required.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
action planwill ensure the establishment o f a financial managementsystem that fully&#13;
meets requirements o f the Project and o f the Bank. According to the Action Plan the&#13;
KVFA andMFEwill prepare arevised FinancialManagementManual for the inclusion&#13;
o f internal controls and fund flow arrangements regardingthe Compensation Fund. This&#13;
Action Plan was discussed with the Recipient duringNegotiations and the Manual will be&#13;
includedinthe Project Operational Manual (a condition o fproject effectiveness).&#13;
&#13;
36.      These Project implementation arrangements, involvingminimaluse o f additional&#13;
staff, support the Interim Strategy Note for Kosovo (March 2006) which includes the goal&#13;
o f reducing the budget deficit with measures that include reducing the government wage&#13;
bill, a measure also supported bythe IMF.&#13;
&#13;
B. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomes/Results&#13;
&#13;
37.      A detailedresults framework andthe associated arrangements for monitoring are&#13;
included inAppendix 2. These are broadly consistent with GPAI standards and&#13;
expectations. Overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation will be with the Project&#13;
Coordinators inMAFRD,to be implementedby one o f the epidemiologists hiredunder&#13;
the Animal Health component and sitting inthe Veterinary Epidemiological Unit.&#13;
&#13;
C. Sustainability,CriticalRisks, and Other Possible ControversialAspects&#13;
&#13;
38.      Critical to the sustainability o f the Project i s the continuous commitment and&#13;
ownership of this initiative by the various stakeholders, coupled with strong political&#13;
support to carry out project activities ina timelymanner. Institutional sustainability&#13;
would be ensured by: (i)   strengthening o fprograms to maintain public awareness o f the&#13;
threat o f avian influenza and other rapid spreadinginfectious diseases; (ii)   sustained&#13;
surveillance and prevention and control activities, particularly inhighrisk regions; (iii)&#13;
strengthened government capacity to manage at territory-wide and local levels the risk&#13;
factors associated with the spread o f AI and other infectious diseases; and, (iv)&#13;
effectiveness o fprograms to control the spreado f AI from birds to the general population&#13;
inthe territory. Senior officials are well aware ofthepotential risk ofAvian Influenza&#13;
and the PISG has committed itselfto a mediumterm strategy, endorsed by WHO and&#13;
other donors, to address these issues. The MAFRDwith its KVFA and the MOH, has set&#13;
up concomitant groups at central and local levels, comprisingexperts andrelevant&#13;
institutional services. A multidisciplinary Working Group chaired by the Deputy Minister&#13;
o f Agriculture is coordinating these efforts, incoordination with the PrimeMinister's&#13;
office. Government i s informed on a weekly basis and passes adequate orders and certain&#13;
decisions, including the provision o f necessary human and financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Main critical risks are associated with the following:&#13;
&#13;
   Insufficient public awareness of the HPAI threat and measures that can be taken to&#13;
      prevent it; Public awareness o f the danger o f an HPAIoutbreak and measures that&#13;
      can prevent it is low, resulting inpreparedness steps not being taken up by the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  population. This risk i s mitigatedby the public awareness and information&#13;
  campaign.&#13;
Poultw industw structure makes Kosovo vulnerable to HPAI outbreaks occurring and&#13;
  spreadinz The existence o f significant numbers o f backyard poultry increases the&#13;
  risk o f HPAIfor Kosovo. This risk will be mitigated by a public awareness&#13;
  campaign emphasizing the importance o f correct handling o fpoultry during&#13;
  outbreaks.&#13;
Timelv pavment of compensation to farmers; Ifthe PISG are unable to pay farmers&#13;
  satisfactory and timely compensation for culled poultry, farmers may not report&#13;
  outbreaks and resist culling. To mitigate this risk satisfactory operational procedures&#13;
  for the compensation fundhave beendeveloped and the fundhas beensufficiently&#13;
  capitalized.&#13;
Misuse of the Compensation Fund facility; There is a risk that corruption will lead to&#13;
  misuse o f the Compensation Fund. To mitigate this risk detailed procedures for the&#13;
  operation o f the Compensation Fund, including mechanisms for controls, reviews,&#13;
  and audits, will beincludedinthe Operational Manual.&#13;
Difficultv of implementing social distancing measures; People may resist any policy o f&#13;
  social distancing should it become necessary. Mitigationo f this risk will be aided by&#13;
  the public information campaign and training o f case workers inearly identification.&#13;
Weak Project implementation capacitv; Capacity within the PISGmay be stretched&#13;
  byproject implementationrequirements. Provision o ftraining, appointment o f&#13;
  supporting staff for coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation, Procurement and&#13;
  Financial Management will build on existing capacity, while regular supervision&#13;
  visits (facilitated byproximityo f the World Bank Task Team Leader and&#13;
  Financial Management and Procurement Specialists) will enable close support&#13;
  and early identification o f any problems.&#13;
Lack of coordination across ministries; An effective response to the threat o f HPAI&#13;
  requires a cross-sectoral response. The potential risk o f lack o f coordination&#13;
  across multiple agencies i s mitigated by the presence o f the GAIWG, and the&#13;
  presence o fthe full-time Project Team and coordination with the Public Safety&#13;
  office inthe Office o f the Prime Minister.&#13;
Limited abilitv of PISG to implement the project in North Mitrovica minoritv enclaves:&#13;
  This poses a realthreat to implementation o fproject activities. This risk is mitigated&#13;
  byusingWHO and UNICEF, both o fwhom have extensive experience operating in&#13;
  such areas, to implement project activities inthese areas as necessary.&#13;
Absence of data sharing between Pristina and the parallel institutions in North&#13;
  Mitrovica; This poses a real threat to project implementation andprevention and&#13;
  control efforts to contain an outbreak, let alone a pandemic. To mitigate this risk,&#13;
  technical support to develop a functional framework allowing for data sharing&#13;
  through an intermediary partner such as WHO/UNICEF will be carried out.&#13;
Lack of coordination between health and veterinaw services, especiallv in North&#13;
  Mitrovica and minoritv enclaves; This may impede active search for human cases&#13;
  should an outbreak inpoultry occur and may therefore increase the risk o f disease&#13;
  among humans with a possible outbreak. To mitigate this, the project will focus on&#13;
  having a Commission for Influenza Pandemic Management (CIPM, to be&#13;
  established under the project) to oversee regular data collection from both services&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              '15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      (to be carried out through WHOAJNICEF inthe north) while increasing awareness&#13;
      among stakeholders at the central, sectoral, organizational and municipal levels.&#13;
&#13;
40.      There are no controversial aspects to the project. It i s consistent with the PISG's&#13;
interim strategy and endorsed by the PISG. The project i s fully consistent with the GPAI.&#13;

IV.        APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
 A. Economic and financial analyses&#13;
&#13;
 56.       The activities supported bythis project are aimed at reducing the likelihood o f an&#13;
 avian influenza outbreak spreading among poultry, reducing the likelihood that is will&#13;
 spread from poultry and other animals to humans, and preparing for a possible pandemic&#13;
 o f H5N1 among humans. The economic implications o f an outbreak o fHPAIamong&#13;
 poultry constitute both first and second order effects, and are potentially far-reaching.&#13;
 The spread o fthe disease among humans would have a far more profound economic&#13;
 impact. Calculating the economic benefits o f the project is complicatedby uncertainties&#13;
 regarding the likelihood o fthese events occurring and the magnitude o f the impact that&#13;
 they would have. Therefore this analysis focuses on the direct financial implications o f&#13;
 outbreaks (both contained and catastrophic) among poultry.&#13;
&#13;
 57.       Calculating the financial impact o f an outbreak on the poultry sector requires&#13;
 makingassumptions about the probabilities o fcontainedand catastrophic outbreaks&#13;
 occurring ina given year. These are presented inthe "with project" scenario and "without&#13;
 project" scenario inAppendix 8. The analysis then calculates the financial losses interms&#13;
 o fpoultry lost as a result o f outbreaks, assuming that during contained outbreaks 7&#13;
 percent o f the total poultry stock i s lost, and duringcatastrophic outbreaks 30 percent i s&#13;
 lost. The total number o fpoultry inKosovo is estimated at 2 million, and the average&#13;
 value o f a mature bird estimated at US$8." Based on the value o f poultry lost under these&#13;
 scenarios, and the assumptions given above, the witWwithout project analysis indicates&#13;
 that the internal rate o freturnfor the project is 18 percent.&#13;
&#13;
 58.       This analysis is limitedto the short term financial implications o fthe spread o fthe&#13;
 virus amongpoultry, thus representinga lower bound on the potential economic benefits&#13;
 o fthe investment. It does not take into account the second order benefits o f reducing the&#13;
 probability o f outbreaks among poultry, for example related to depressed demand for&#13;
 poultry or damage to the industry and restricted trade as a result o f outbreaks. It also does&#13;
 not take into account the much more significant benefits from preventing the spread o f&#13;
 the virus to humans; benefitsbeyondthe life o fthe project (it can be assumed that the&#13;
 benefits o f the project will filly come into play after the end o f the project); and the long-&#13;
 term benefits o fthe project, which include strengthenedcapacity inthe veterinary and&#13;
 human health systems to prepare for, control and respond to HPAIinfection and other&#13;
 zoonoses and infectious disease emergencies inboth animals and humans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 II The model also assumes the poultry stock i s not replaced each year. All poultry inthe commercial sector&#13;
 are layers and the majority o f backyard poultry are also reared for egg production. This complicates the&#13;
 exercise o f calculating the market price for a chicken since poultry are not usually sold for meat. However,&#13;
 market surveys indicate that domestic poultry (comprising 70 percent o fKosovo's poultry sector) are sold&#13;
 at prices between  6 - 8 inPristina and  5     -  10inLipjan. Market prices for industrialpoultry (30 percent&#13;
 o f the sector) are less. US$ 8 is taken as an estimate based on these factors. The figure o f 2 million poultry&#13;
 is an estimate based on figures from late 2005 and reported reductions since then.&#13;

B. Technical&#13;
&#13;
Public Awareness and Information&#13;
&#13;
59.     Information and public awareness i s a critical and overarching component o f an&#13;
effective HPAIprevention and response strategy that demands special attention. The&#13;
current situation regardinginformation andpublic awareness is not satisfactory. The&#13;
general population i s not well informed about HPAI, ways o f transmission, risks and&#13;
prevention. The lack o fpolicies or a multi-sectoral approach covering this area needs to&#13;
be addressed as soon as possible. Fragmentedand sometimes confusing and conflicting&#13;
information propagated by media outlets and institutions indicate that the focus should be&#13;
directed at effective coordination between the different stakeholders that have a role to&#13;
play; and mechanisms to reach both specific groups and the general population. The&#13;
activities under the project will help the PISG to put inplace a common communication&#13;
strategy and help ensure that all involved partners "speak a common language" inregard&#13;
to HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
Animal Health&#13;
&#13;
60.     Successfbl implementation o f the project depends on a phased multi-disciplinary&#13;
strategy based on a sound epidemiological approach to prevention and control o f HPAI&#13;
outbreaks. This strategy has to take into consideration the range o f epidemiological&#13;
scenarios that exist or may arise inKosovo, as well as the different poultry production&#13;
systems inthe territory and different levels o f incidence (ranging from highincidence&#13;
with variable flock outbreaks, through low frequency disease outbreaks with partial flock&#13;
immunity,to sporadic outbreaks). A balanced combination o f appropriate disease control&#13;
options, tailored to the specific characteristics andneeds o f Kosovo, is therefore essential&#13;
for the achievement o f the project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
61.     The final aim would be to improve the capacity o f Kosovo's veterinary services,&#13;
primarilythe KVFA as the PISG's competent authority for animal health, but also&#13;
subordinated veterinary stations inthe territory. Key issues to be addressed by the project&#13;
include: capacity o f veterinary services, harmonization o f disease information systems;&#13;
capacity for practicing effective bio-safety measures; coordination betweenpublic&#13;
agencies and linkages with the private sector; disease surveillance and control, diagnostic&#13;
capacities and applied research; and surveillance and control o f HPAI.The project will&#13;
also address communicating to farmers how to protect their poultry from exposure to&#13;
HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
Human Health&#13;
&#13;
62.     Though there have beenno reported cases o f HPAIinhumans to date, given the&#13;
numbers o f domestically-reared poultry inKosovo there is significant risk o f&#13;
transmission o f the virus to humans should an outbreak among poultry occur. Should an&#13;
outbreak occur, the capacity o f the MOH, IPHand other stakeholders to rapidly and&#13;
accurately detect HPAIcases inhumans, appropriately treat patients and prevent the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
transmission and spread o fthe virus is still relatively limited. Investigation teams do exist&#13;
at both the territory-wide and regional levels, but their capacity to quickly and effectively&#13;
investigate and respond to local outbreaks appears limited. The capacity o f health&#13;
services to effectively isolate suspicious cases and treat patients contaminatedwith the&#13;
virus is at present also extremely limited.This puts bothpatients and healthworkers at&#13;
highrisk ifvirus mutationleads to possiblehumanto humantransmission. Lastly, inthe&#13;
case o f a pandemic, health services will rapidly become unable to cope with a rapid&#13;
increase o f the number o fpatients.&#13;
&#13;
63.     The project addressesthese constraints through Component 3, HumanHealth, by&#13;
giving priority to: i)establishing an active surveillance systemat the territory-wide and&#13;
regional IPHlevels; ii)strengthening the capacity o f the investigation teams through&#13;
training and provision o f necessary equipment, notably PPE; iii)the creation o f isolation&#13;
rooms; iv) training o fhealth workers inmanaging patients affectedwith highly&#13;
pathogenic viruses; and v) identification o f culturally and socially appropriate social&#13;
distancing measures incase o f a pandemic event and the preparation o f "clean out plans"&#13;
for hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
C. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
64.     The Grant Unit o f the MFEwill be responsible for disbursement, financial&#13;
reporting and auditing o f the project, while the KVFA will ensure that payments are&#13;
approvedby appropriate staff only after services have beendelivered before payment&#13;
requests are forwarded to the MFE.&#13;
&#13;
65.     Assessments o f the financial management arrangements o f the implementing&#13;
entities for the project were undertaken. The MFE's financial management system i s&#13;
capable o f supporting the implementation o f the proposedproject in accordance with the&#13;
requirements o f OP 10.02, except for the Compensation Fundsub-component for which&#13;
internal control and fund flow arrangements will be prepared before effectiveness. The&#13;
overall financial management risk for the project is moderate to substantial before&#13;
mitigation measures, and with adequate mitigation measures inplace, the financial&#13;
management residual risk is ratedmoderate.&#13;
&#13;
66.     As o f the date o f this report, the MAFRD,MFE and UNMIK do not have any&#13;
overdue audit. The annual audited project financial statements will be provided to the&#13;
Bank within six months o f the end o f each fiscal year and also at the closing o f the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
67.     An OperationalFinancialAccountability Report was finalized inMay 2005.&#13;
Despite significant progress since 2001, public financial management inKosovo suffers&#13;
from fundamental weaknesses, and basic structures for financial accountability are still in&#13;
their infancy. The overall legal framework for budgeting andbudgetmanagement is&#13;
largely compatible with internationally recognized standards, but for some aspects it&#13;
appears to be too advanced for the current administration's capacity. Carry-over practices&#13;
and weaknesses incapacity, organization and coordination hamper budget preparation&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and underniine the credibility o f the budget as a policy management instrument. While&#13;
treasury and cash management are well-regulated areas o fpublic financial management,&#13;
they suffer from inefficiencies. The system through which Commitment and Payment&#13;
Orders flow to ensure authorization o f payments i s well regulated. The Treasury&#13;
authorizes commitments and payments based on proposals and supporting documentation&#13;
bybudgetorganizations and municipalities. The Treasury pays from a single account in&#13;
the central Banking and Payment Authority o f Kosovo (BPK).&#13;
&#13;
68.        As with most public financial management functions, accounting i s constrained&#13;
by limited capacity, and financial reportingneeds more realistic requirements and&#13;
statutory deadlines, improved procedures, and trained personnel. Internal control and&#13;
internal audit at all levels o f government are intheir infancy. Considerable time and&#13;
effort will be requiredto make them fully operational. External audit i s undeveloped and,&#13;
as with internal audit, it will need sustained external support for its development.&#13;
&#13;
D. Social&#13;
&#13;
69:        The approximately 113,000 rural families (roughly halfo f all rural households)'*&#13;
who own an estimated 1.5 million backyard poultry birds for their own consumption will&#13;
beparticularly affectedby an HPAIoutbreak, and stand to gain most from increased&#13;
capacity to prevent the spread o f HPAIamong poultry. Such households are at highest&#13;
risk o f exposure to HPAI, inparticular women and children who are most often involved&#13;
inthe handlingofchickens (feeding, eggcollection etc.).&#13;
&#13;
70.        Given the involvement o f children inmanaging domestic poultry, the Public&#13;
Awareness and Information component is an important step, and awareness and&#13;
educational efforts need to ensure that children are effectively targeted with appropriately&#13;
designed messages. Reaching women and marginalized communities will similarly&#13;
require specific dissemination and outreach channels.&#13;
&#13;
71.        Households dependent on backyard poultry will also suffer loss of income as a&#13;
result o f an outbreak, and have fewer opportunities for income open to them ifthey are&#13;
deterred from entering poultry production, with unemployment highand participation in&#13;
the labor market low inrural areas.13 Poultry is an important source o f food and own-&#13;
produced food such as poultry i s important preventive factor reducing income poverty in&#13;
rural areas.14Even ifthey do not lose their poultry as a result o f an outbreak, the need to&#13;
&#13;
'* Share  o f families having chickens is 56.3% Survey o f rural families, Riinvest 2004.&#13;
l3 The Kosovo Development Fund,a World Bank-funded CDD operation, informedthe World Bank team&#13;
about the cancellation o f a project aimed at supplyingsingle parent families (mostly female headed) with&#13;
poultry to start commercial operations. The project was supposed to start inearly 2006 but didnot as a&#13;
result o f HPAI outbreaks inthe region (beneficiaries didnot want poultry because o f fear o f HPAI). Also,&#13;
unemployment is an important determinant o fpoverty (Kosovo Poverty Assessment. Promoting&#13;
Opportunity, Security, and Participation for All. World Bank Report No. 23278-XK. June 16, 2005).&#13;
l4"The contribution o f ownproduced food to household consumption-which           i s included inthe welfare&#13;
aggregate usedto derive the poverty figures-was    muchhigher inrural areas (19 percent) than inurban&#13;
areas (less than 2 percent).". Kosovo Poverty Assessment.Promoting Opportunity, Security, and&#13;

income.&#13;
&#13;
72.     The remaining 500,000 o f Kosovo's poultry stock is reared on approximately 122&#13;
commercial farms. Two o f these have more than 100,000 head o fpoultry; three have&#13;
more than 10,000; while the rest are small businesses with 1,000 to 10,000 head o f&#13;
poultry (averaging around 3,600).15 The effects o f an HPAIoutbreak will be strongly felt&#13;
by small commercial farms o fbetween 1,000 and 5,000 chickens. Most o fthese are&#13;
family businesses where all family members are involved inoperations, and all family&#13;
members would be exposed to the risk o f infection. They also suffer financially and are&#13;
most likely to be pushed out o fthe sector as a result o f a decrease inegg consumption (in&#13;
January and February 2006 egg consumption inKosovo decreased by 90 percent). In&#13;
other countries with HPAIprojects the poultry sector has been unsupportive o f&#13;
campaigns to increase awareness o f HPAIdue to the negative effects o f increased&#13;
awareness on poultry consumption. Inorder to counter this, the public awareness and&#13;
information campaign will be designedina sensitive way to avoid unnecessarily&#13;
depressing the demand for poultry products.&#13;
&#13;
73.     A concern relating to project implementation is the division o f society along&#13;
ethnic lines, particularly with regardto parallel institutions inthe health sector. Inthe&#13;
animal health sector integration is satisfactory, and the veterinary authorities have been&#13;
involved inlivestock culling and compensation with ethnic Albanians and with the&#13;
minority Serb population. Lack o f integration inthe health sector is more o f a problem.&#13;
An effective communication strategy that targets all minority groups increases the&#13;
probability that project objectives will be achieved, for example communicating the need&#13;
for preventive measures; and, inthe case o f an outbreak, communicating the need for&#13;
culling measures, the terms o f compensation and the importance o f cooperation with the&#13;
veterinaryservices. Key to achieving this will be the involvement o frepresentatives fi-om&#13;
minority groups inthe design and implementation o fthe communication strategy and the&#13;
delivery o fmessages, particularly at the grassroots level within minority communities.&#13;
&#13;
E. Environment&#13;
&#13;
74.     Activities underthe Project are not expected to generate significant adverse&#13;
environmental effects as they are focused largely on public sector capacity buildingand&#13;
improved readiness for dealing with outbreaks o f avian influenza indomestic poultry and&#13;
human health. These prevention-focused activities are expected to have a positive&#13;
environmental impact as the Project's investments infacilities, equipment, and training&#13;
for laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over the existing avian&#13;
influenza handling and testingprocedures and meet the international standards&#13;
established by the WHO and OIE. There are three environmental issues that will be&#13;
addressed inthe Operations Manual: the procedures for culling and disposal o fpoultry;&#13;
thehandling o fmedical waste generatedby laboratories and healthcare facilities; and&#13;
civil works associated with the rehabilitation o f labs and the construction o f the virology&#13;
laboratory for the KVFA.&#13;

75.     The project supports investments incivil works (construction and rehabilitation o f&#13;

safeguard screening. An Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management&#13;
Plan satisfactory to the Association (both conditions o f effectiveness) will address these&#13;
issues. A waiver for the requirements to complete the EA and EMP during project&#13;
preparationhas been sought per para. 12 o f OP 4.01.&#13;

&#13;
77.      The potential threat posedbyHPAIis well documented inthe GPAIPAD. With&#13;
the emergence o f the global HPAIthreat and its spread to Europe, Kosovo i s regarded as&#13;
a place at strategic risk, due to its shared borders with countries with confirmed&#13;
occurrences o f HPAI and/or that are also identified as countries at strategic risk; the&#13;
numbers o fpoultry reared on small family farms inproximityto humans;I6 and its nearby&#13;
position inrelation to migratory bird routes, which entails a risk o f exposure to&#13;
potentially infected wild birds flying from neighboring countries. Thus there i s&#13;
considerable risk o fpotential outbreaks and the spread o f HPAI. There have been no&#13;
reported cases o f avian influenza inKosovo to date, however Kosovo i s the only territory&#13;
with no detected cases inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
78.      An outbreak o fHPAIamong wild birds or domestic poultry, even without it&#13;
spreading, would have a serious effect on KOSOVO'S               economy, particularly inrural areas.&#13;
It is estimated that about 75 percent o fKosovo's estimated 2 - 2.6 million poultry&#13;
population is domestically reared, free-range, averaging 19birds per household in about&#13;
113,000 small farms.I7 The remainder is reared on about 122 commercial farms. The&#13;
poultry industry, which primarily consists o f layers, contributed about 4 percent o f&#13;
agricultural GDP in2005 and i s one o f the sub-sectors that show signs o f growth and&#13;
with a potential comparative advantage. The outbreaks that occurredthroughout Europe&#13;
inearly 2006 caused significant damage to KOSOVO'S industrydue to depressed&#13;
                                                                   poultry&#13;
demand for poultry products; much greater harm would come from an outbreak.18 In&#13;
addition to consequences for poultry sector performance, an outbreak would also have&#13;
negative effects on rural income andpoverty. The sale o f domestically produced eggs and&#13;
meat (average approximately $ 8 market price for a chicken), provides an important&#13;
source of income for rural families, who also rely on domestic poultry and eggs&#13;
production as a source o f food.&#13;
&#13;
79.      The most direct economic impact o f anHPAIoutbreak will stem from the need to&#13;
cull poultry in affected areas and offer compensation to affected farmers for loss o f their&#13;
birds.Eveninareas where a cull is not necessary, other necessary measures to prevent&#13;
the spread o f the disease such as enclosing all poultry (which increases the cost to small&#13;
farmers o f raising poultry due to housing and increased feeding costs) and prohibiting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16Factors such as widespread migrationto Western Europe and widespread new construction following the&#13;
conflict o f 1999, mean that domestically-reared poultry or poultry on small family farms are generally&#13;
reared inmore bio-secure conditions than previously. For example, they are kept away from human&#13;
residences. There i s also evidence that people are willing to enclose their poultry during periods when the&#13;
riskofHPAIoutbreaks is high.&#13;
17Poultry numbers were estimated at 2.6 million in"Series 2: Agriculture and Environment Statistics&#13;
Agriculture Household Survey 2005," Statistical Office o f Kosovo, 2006. Poultry numberstendto vary by&#13;
season, and are reportedto have undergone a contraction since late 2005 as a result o f the spring 2006&#13;
outbreaks o fHPAI among poultry across the region.&#13;

transport o f and trade inpoultry, have already affected the industry and will do so again&#13;
as enforcement i s strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
80.     The spread o fHPAIto humans, andthe mutation o fthe virus to a form&#13;
transmissible betweenhumans, could have a devastating effect on Kosovo along the lines&#13;
of the probable effect inother countries (see GPAIPAD).&#13;
&#13;
81.     The PISG has responded proactively to the H P A Ithreat, but mounting an&#13;
appropriate and effective response is beyondthe financial and technical capacity o f the&#13;
PISG. Critical needs include investinginnewly-created structures with the necessary&#13;
mandates and authorities; communicating the messagesneeded to prevent HPAI&#13;
outbreaks and control the spreado f the disease among the population and encourage&#13;
farmers to participate inculling schemes; and strengthening the territory's public health&#13;
and veterinarian systems to prevent and manage an outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
82.     KOSOVO'Shas so far producedthree coordinatedterritory-wide plans related&#13;
                    PISG&#13;
to HPAIincluding: the "Operational Planon Fightingand Eradicating Avian Influenza"&#13;
prepared by the Department o f EmergencyManagement (DEM), focusing on overall&#13;
planning response; the "Action Plan for the Prevention of Influenza Pandemic" prepared&#13;
bythe MOH, focusing on humanhealth; and the "Operational Plan for Zones infected&#13;
with Avian Influenza" preparedbythe MAFRD.Several assessmentshave concluded&#13;
that many aspects o fthese plans are well developed, but with some important concerns&#13;
remaining.&#13;
&#13;
83.     The DEM's Operational Plan on Fightingand Eradicating Avian Influenza is&#13;
regarded as a well-articulated plan, bringingtogether various stakeholders inthe response&#13;
to HPAIoutbreaks amongst birds and the possible spread to humans. The roles and&#13;
responsibilities o f the various actors are clearly defined and simulation exercises have&#13;
been carried out to fine tune the operational plan, but issues remain, such as limited&#13;
capacity to address multipleHPAIoutbreaks, the need for greater clarity over what&#13;
institutions are able and mandated to provide support to the response plan. DEMand&#13;
other civil defense actors lack some material and financial resources critical to the&#13;
success o f the operation (Le. decontamination vehicles); these need to be costed so that&#13;
resources can be mobilized.&#13;
&#13;
84.     A key issue on the MOH's "Action Planfor the Preventiono f Influenza&#13;
Pandemic" i s that the MOH lacks the financial resources to fully implement the plan, in&#13;
spite ofurgent and critical elements that need to be funded. Inaddition the pandemic&#13;
phase (WHO Phase 6) scenario and operational response needs to be better elaborated,&#13;
especially from a public health perspective, articulating exactly what the public health&#13;
measures and enforcements need to be put into place. This will also enable other&#13;
departments and sectors to plan accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
85.     MAFRD's OperationalPlan for Zones infectedwith Avian Influenza hasbeen&#13;
reviewedby FA0Rome and assessed as viable and technically sound. Overall it seems&#13;
that planning, preparedness and awareness-raising for an outbreak o f HPAI(amongst&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
poultry) i s good, both within the PISG and amongst the general public. The PISG&#13;
veterinary agency has also established good links with poultry farmers and veterinarians&#13;
throughout the territory. However, development and implementation o f the plan requires&#13;
financial and technical support from donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
86.     A key concern is the lack o fcooperationbetween authorities inPristina and&#13;
parallel institutions based inNorth Mitrovicathat govern Serb areas inthe North and in&#13;
enclaves across Kosovo. The KVFA i s able to operate throughout Kosovo, including in&#13;
such areas. Inother sectors, however, the lack o f cooperation has the potential to&#13;
compromise KOSOVO'S     ability to tackle the HPAIthreat. This particularly applies to&#13;
public health institutions, but also to education; inboth sectors public sector workers&#13;
receive salaries and other institutional support from Belgrade, and report to the same. On&#13;
an overall planning level, the PISGand the parallel institutions are usingdifferent&#13;
preparedness and contingency plans, the latter usinga plan formulated by Belgrade.&#13;
&#13;
87.     Operating in"minority enclaves" i s difficult for the PISG, which has implications&#13;
for the DEMand the project. This task i s frequently delegated to KFOR and UN&#13;
agencies. Inaddition, the discrepancies and lack o f communication andcollaboration&#13;
between the public health systems under the PISG and the parallel institutions have&#13;
important ramifications for HPAIresponse; in order to contain and or respond to the&#13;
spread o f the influenza, communication and cooperation between these two systems i s a&#13;
necessity. A solution for the latter, at least at the technical/operational level, is a critical&#13;
precursor to mounting an effective operationto prevent, prepare and plan for an H P A I&#13;
outbreak. Inorder to promote effective communication and project implementation in&#13;
minority enclaves the project will utilize the technical capacities o fUNICEF and WHO.&#13;
BothUNagencies are credible and have a presence inthese areas, and can assist with&#13;
implementingthe project and inbridgingthis communication gap.&#13;

88.     An effective public awareness and information dissemination campaign will be critical&#13;
for promoting the widespread adoption o f measures to preventthe spread o f the disease, by&#13;
reducing the risk o f animal to animal transmission; reducing the risk o f animal to human&#13;
transmission; andpreventing the spread o f humaninfluenza. It will also be crucial for keeping&#13;
the population informed o f developments.&#13;
&#13;
89.     Some work has been done on a public awareness in2005 and early 2006. Regular press&#13;
conferences were heldduringthe early 2006 Europeanoutbreaks, along with other public&#13;
awareness and communication activities such as leafleting campaigns and television campaigns.&#13;

90.     The Institute o fPublic Health (IPH) has a Department for Health Promotionwhich&#13;
includes a Central unit placed inPristina and a network o fhealth promotion units inRegional&#13;
IPHs. This departmenthas important experience gained from numerous Information, Education&#13;
and Communication (IEC) Campaigns carried out duringthe last 6 years, for example in&#13;
conducting immunization campaigns for Polio eradication, Measles control, HIV/AIDSetc.&#13;
Some IEC materials have already been developed by the communications working group and&#13;
disseminated through a network o f health institutions. Onthe animal health side KVFA has also&#13;
developed printed materials (leaflets andposters) and a television spot targeting poultry workers&#13;
and animal health workers. KVFA field activities have involved highranking PISG officials and&#13;
were given important place inKosovo mass media. Generally speaking communication o f the&#13;
PISG and its institutions with territory-wide and local media are good and should be seen as an&#13;
asset to successful implementation o f the Public Awareness and Information component.&#13;
&#13;
91.     Inspite o fthis, communication efforts are fragmented andinsufficiently coordinated.&#13;
Considerable work i s needed to create and implement an effective communications campaign.&#13;
&#13;
92.     Ingeneral peopleare not well informed on avianflu, ways oftransmission, risks and&#13;
prevention, and confusing and conflicting information i s propagated including by media outlets.&#13;
The communications response also lacks effective coordinationbetweenthe different&#13;
stakeholders that have a role to play. A successfd communication campaign inKosovo should&#13;
initially answer the following key questions: which are the target populations to be reached, their&#13;
specifics and commonalities, and what are the key risky behaviors o f those target populations, in&#13;
order to inform messagepositioning strategy etc.&#13;
&#13;
93.     A considerable proportion o fthe Kosovo population lives inrural areas andinclose&#13;
contact with poultry. An important feature inKosovo is parallelism o f social and political&#13;
systems inminority (Serb) areas and the fact that even technical issues are highlypoliticized.&#13;
The most socially disadvantaged community inKosovo is the minorityRoma-Ashkalia-Egyptian&#13;
(RAE) community, especiallythe portion o fthis community that lives incamp settings and in&#13;
ghettos characterized by poor economic status, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions and poor&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure ingeneral. Inthese areas, where risk o f an outbreak i s greatest and poor hygiene&#13;
practices and poor information and awareness pose a particular problem, PISG directives aimed&#13;
at preventingand containing HPAI are most scarce and difficult to promote and enforce.&#13;
&#13;
94.     This component i s designed primarily to safeguard human health, inparticular for&#13;
extension staff, animal health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improvingpublic&#13;
awareness and information. It will achieve this through assistance indeveloping the strategic&#13;
communication plan and developing and testing messages and materials to be used to help&#13;
preventthe spread o fHPAIamongpoultry and its transmission to humans. It will further&#13;
enhance the structures inplace to coordinate communication and disseminate information from&#13;
territory-wide to local levels for all communities, and between the public and private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
95.      Coordination, an inter-sectoral approach and networking and involvement o f all relevant&#13;
structures.are seen as a critical feature o f the communication component. Therefore,&#13;
establishment o fthe Communication working groups at all three levels o f activities i s a must for&#13;
the successful implementation o fthe communication component. At a central level an inter-&#13;
sectoral technical communication Working Group (CWG) with initially 11members&#13;
representing the MOH, IPH, MAFRD, KVFA, Ministryo f Environment and Spatial Planning&#13;
(MESP), Ministryo f Education, Science and Technology (MEST), WHO, and UNICEF (and&#13;
possibly others), has been established as a subsection o f the PISG's GAIWG, and has started&#13;
working on a strategic communication plan for prevention o f HPAI. This C W G will channel its&#13;
activities to the community level through a network o f seven Regional CWGs and 30 Municipal&#13;
CWGs (Kosovo i s divided into five administrative regions and 30 municipalities). Each working&#13;
group will be comprised from five members representingstakeholders, health sector, veterinarian&#13;
sector, education sector and NGO/civil society. At the regional level CWG will be established&#13;
from regional governmental structures while at the municipal level from municipal governmental&#13;
structures, implementing institutions and civil society. Intotal there will be over 200 people&#13;
involved incommunication network. Special attention should be paid to the organizational&#13;
approach o f the CWGs to involve Kosovo Serb and RAEcommunities, and a strictly technical&#13;
approach towards planning and implementation o f this component should be employed to avoid&#13;
politicization.&#13;
&#13;
96.     This Component will be implemented inclose coordination with other donors that bring&#13;
technical expertise inthe area o f communications, and a wealth o f experience conducting such&#13;
campaigns inKosovo and elsewhere. UNICEF is the principal agency inthis regard. It i s&#13;
expected that UNICEF will play a lead role inthe donor community response to public&#13;
awareness and information needs. UNICEF i s funding activities prior to project effectiveness to&#13;
the amount o fUS$lO,OOO.&#13;
&#13;
A.      RiskCommunication&#13;
&#13;
97.     The main goal for outbreak communication is to communicate with the public inways&#13;
that build, maintain or restore trust, provide them with information on the status o f HPAIinthe&#13;
territory, the PISG's strategy, and what they can do to mitigate the risk.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98.    The institution responsible for overseeing and developing the communication strategy&#13;
andplan, announcing updated information, and establishing a functional relationship with the&#13;
media, will be the Central CWG. The multi-dimensional problems associated with HPAI&#13;
infection necessitate collaborationbetween a wide range o f stakeholders: various ministries,&#13;
KVFA,Veterinary services, IPH,healthinstitutions, UNagencies, NGOs and civil society&#13;
organizations, private sector companies and farmer associations and media. This&#13;
multidimensional character is reflected inthe proposed composition o f the Central CWG.&#13;
Development o f the H P A ICommunication Strategy will be strongly supported by UNICEF.&#13;
&#13;
99.     The Main activities o fthe CWGwill include maintainingcommunication channels with&#13;
the media and the general public and continuing to collect feedback from the public on the level&#13;
o f awareness o f the specific preventiodprotection measure according to the outbreak phase. The&#13;
Central C W G will appoint a liaison officer from its membership and prepare a risk&#13;
communication planthat will be shared on a regular basis with relevant Governmental structures&#13;
and institutions. Those institutions will announce updated information to the general public&#13;
through appointed spokespersons and available media channels on a regular basis. Ifagreed by&#13;
the leading institutions the C W G liaison officer will establish an effective working relationship&#13;
and interactionwith the media to update them on the situation and measures being taken and will&#13;
also establish a mechanism for receiving feedback from the public on the level o f awareness. She&#13;
or he will also share information and raise awareness among printed and electronic media outlets&#13;
on how to prevent the spread o f avian flu and identify ways media can help with this (organize&#13;
awareness meetings, prepare media advocacy packs, FAQs to share with media representatives).&#13;
The communications working group will also be responsible for improving the effective&#13;
coordination and collaboration among these multiple stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
100.    Inthe second andthirdyears ofthe project the communications working group will focus&#13;
on sustaining communication channels established inthe first year, and adjust information-&#13;
sharing according to the evolving situation and development o fvarious global and territorial&#13;
scenarios. The Central C W G will advise the GAIWG on all matters related to the&#13;
communications campaign through regular and frequent contact with GAIWG.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Communicationfor BehaviorChange&#13;
&#13;
101.    This subcomponent will consist o f a pre-epidemic campaign inthe first 6-12 months o f&#13;
the project. Itwill aim to makethe public aware o fthe need to handlepoultry andpoultry&#13;
products more cautiously and to improve hygieneknowledge and practices relating to normal&#13;
humanflu. The aims are to identify and designkeymessagesandproductiono fsets o fIEC&#13;
materials targeting all target audiences, inparticular for a) professional staff (in all relevant&#13;
sectors) to increase knowledge, skills andpractices incommunication for behavior change to&#13;
prevent spread o f HPAI, and b) for the general public to be aware and empowered to protect&#13;
themselves from HPAI.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                             39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B1:      Preparation,productionanddistributionofInformation, Educationand&#13;
Communication(IEC) materials.&#13;
&#13;
102.     The project will support materials targetingthe general public and specific target groups:&#13;
children, health and veterinary personnel, poultry producers and hunters' associations, teachers&#13;
andhard to reach and excluded communities. The central C W G will define key messages,&#13;
analyze and define target audiences, develop test sets o f IEC materials to be produced and&#13;
distributedincommunity languages (Albanian, Serbian, Roma and Turkish), and identify most&#13;
suitable channels o f communication. The design o f communication materials needs to take into&#13;
account ethnic and cultural characteristics of target audiences.&#13;
&#13;
103.     IEC sets o fprinted materials" with basic prevention messages for most at risk audiences&#13;
will be developed inthe shortest time possible. Quantities o fprintedmaterials indifferent&#13;
languages will have to be carefully calculated and, following a rapid field test, will need to be&#13;
adjustedaccordingly to cover needs andbe available andaccessible for target audiences.&#13;
&#13;
104.     Inadditionto printedmaterialsfor general audience anIECpackage adjusted for children&#13;
with child-friendly and simple information (games, puzzles) will be produced as a part o f a&#13;
school package that will complement the teachers' guide for prevention of avian influenza. IEC&#13;
materialswill be distributedby the government structures: health, education, agriculture&#13;
agencies, and the existing NGO network. Special outreach distribution strategies will be&#13;
developed for the most marginalized, hardto reach communities e.g. the RAE community.&#13;
&#13;
105.     For the first six months of the project this subcomponent aims to support production and&#13;
broadcasting o ftwo television spots focusing on key messages and targeting the general public&#13;
(e.g., handwashing and food safety issues), ensuringbroad coverage of the population. TV spots&#13;
for the general public will be aired on the territory-wide and local televisions andradios (RTK,&#13;
KTV, RTV21, MOST network). Television is seen as one o fthe most successful and cost&#13;
effective communication channels inKosovo, and almost all houses inKosovo have television&#13;
sets. Airing o fthe television spot should be based on the media assessmentsthat are available&#13;
and that suggest which are the main television channels, their coverage and most popular&#13;
viewing times. Key stakeholders o f the PISGand supporting agencies should be encouraged and&#13;
asked to use their authority and influence to request main media to support broadcastingpublic&#13;
service announcements.&#13;
&#13;
106.     Inadditionto classic communication methods innovative approaches shouldbeused,&#13;
such as inter-personal communication, focus group discussions, human advertisement, internet&#13;
and web casting etc. Existing web-pages o f key PISG institutions will be enriched with the H P A I&#13;
folder and provide information and links to keyweb-sites dealing with HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
107.     After the initial campaigninthe first year o fthe project, this subcomponent will aim to&#13;
sustain the campaign, by supporting efforts to achieve and maintain the proposed behavior&#13;
changes, and assessingthe impact of aggressive social mobilization interventions duringthe first&#13;
six months. The inventory o f TV spots and other IEC materials will be updatedbasedon&#13;
continuous monitoring o f the efficacy and acceptance o f the materials used duringthe first year.&#13;
&#13;
l 9Posters, flyers, leaflets, brochures, T-shirts, caps, banners.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Line ministries and authorities will provide administrative support and guidance to ensure&#13;
coordination o f structures inthe field.&#13;
&#13;
B2:     Capacity development&#13;
&#13;
108.    This subcomponent will support capacity development for interpersonal communication&#13;
(IPC) and communication for behavior change. It will target CWGs at all levels, media, health&#13;
andveterinary professionals andteachers and community groups (NGOs, youth organizations&#13;
community leaders). Training guidelines will be prepared by experts inministries o fhealth,&#13;
education and agriculture and will include a trainers' manual, a unified field communications&#13;
guide and a practical tool/guideline for teachers on how to develop extracurricular activities&#13;
related to prevention o f HPAI. An inter-sectoralteam o f trainers will be identifiedat the&#13;
territory level and trained on communication for behavior change. These experts will facilitate&#13;
capacity development o f core resource people at the regional and municipal levels that will be&#13;
involved insocial mobilization.&#13;
&#13;
109.    Duringthe first phase (untilthe endo f2007) activities will mainly focus on the highrisk&#13;
areas and the regional level. Local structures and community groups involved insocial&#13;
mobilization will develop their capacities and skills inIPC and other communication techniques.&#13;
Regional training sessionswill be organized for the personnel o f regional institutions and&#13;
municipalities identified as having highrisk areas. At a later phase each regional team, supported&#13;
by central institutions, will organize training sessions at the municipal level.&#13;
&#13;
110.    Trainedpersonnel will be closely monitored and followed up by a supervisory team&#13;
composed o fthree persons, representing the Central and Regional CWGs, which will conduct&#13;
regular visits duringthe first phase o f the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
111.    The second phase (FY08 and beyond) will focus more at the municipal level targeting all&#13;
municipalities, and will seek involvement o f veterinary and health service providers and&#13;
teachers. This phase will also be usedto fine-tune the capacity development methodology and&#13;
tools, and define the adequate supervisory structure.&#13;
&#13;
B3:     Social mobilization&#13;
&#13;
112.    A coordinating structure will be established at eachregionand each municipality with&#13;
representatives from the health, education, food and agriculture departments, community leaders,&#13;
representatives o f local NGOs, youth groups and local media to coordinate work at regional&#13;
levels. The core o f the municipal coordination structure will be the municipal CWG. Activities&#13;
will focus on raising awareness with representatives o f local government and community groups,&#13;
youth organizations, reporters, teachers and parents and health personnel, veterinary personnel&#13;
and farmers. Local structures and community groups involved insocial mobilization will&#13;
develop their capacities and skills ininterpersonal communication (IPC) and other&#13;
communication techniques. Social mobilization activities will be tailored by the audience and&#13;
will involve relevant professionals and influential individuals inthe community.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
113.    Social mobilization activities will be initiated inthe first year o f the project. Activities&#13;
thereafter will aim to expand social mobilization to all levels and build sustainable behavior&#13;
change inspecific groups and the general population.&#13;
&#13;
B4:     Monitoringand evaluation&#13;
&#13;
114.    At the onset ofthe launchingo fthe Public Awareness and Informationcomponent ofthe&#13;
project a rapidassessment will be conducted to assess key behavior o fthe population related to&#13;
the suggestedpractices for change. It will provide baseline data to measure the impact o f the&#13;
Public Awareness and Information activities.&#13;
&#13;
115.    Withinthe first six months o fthe project a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP)&#13;
survey will be prepared and conducted to provide wider information and monitor the impact o f&#13;
the communication for behavior change activities on the target population. Duringthis phase the&#13;
subcomponent will also focus on mapping out o f main social structures at the region and the&#13;
municipal level to assist inplanning o f social mobilization interventions. It will conduct&#13;
monitoringand supervision o fcapacity development and social mobilization activities to ensure&#13;
maximum impact; engaginglocal structures, youth organizations, social business structures.&#13;
&#13;
116.    Inthe second andthirdyears monitoring andevaluationinterventions will focus on&#13;
sustaining results achieved duringthe first year interms o f achieving and maintaining the&#13;
proposedbehavior changes, assessing the impact o f aggressive social mobilization interventions&#13;
duringthe first phase. Monitoringand evaluation interventionswill also focus on project&#13;
implementation indicators based on the agreed timetables.&#13;
&#13;
117.    Impact evaluation will be supported by rapidassessmentsand evaluations, focus groups&#13;
and other qualitative methods. At the end o f the project a final Knowledge, Attitudes and&#13;
Practices (KAP) surveywill be conducted.&#13;
&#13;
Component11:           AnimalHealth(US$1,471,900 equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
118.    The Kosovo Veterinary andFoodAgency (KVFA) is the veterinary authority inKosovo&#13;
responsible for animal health, veterinary public health and animal welfare through disease&#13;
surveillance and control programs; control of food imports at Border InspectionPosts (BIP); and&#13;
pharmaco-vigilance. KVFA, formerly Kosovo Veterinary Service (KVS), i s a new organization&#13;
established in2001 inthe Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA) under UNMIK.InDecember 2003&#13;
the responsibilitywas transferred to the PISG under MAFRD.With technical assistance and&#13;
support from UNMIK,FAO, EU, USAID, etc. the institutional capacity o f KVFA has improved&#13;
and it has developed sustainable program andbeen able to develop and implement its mandate in&#13;
Kosovo. KVFA employs a limitednumber o f official staff and outsources public veterinary tasks&#13;
to private practitioners. KVFA intendsto become integrated inthe network o f officially&#13;
recognizedInternationalVeterinary Organizations.&#13;
&#13;
119.    Personnel: The total number o fveterinarians inKosovo is 200, ofwhich 153 are in&#13;
privatepractice and 47 are employedby the PISG. There are 55 Veterinary stations with 64&#13;
veterinarians and seven district veterinary inspectors for five regions. The veterinary stations'&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
main task is to provide clinical veterinary services. Each station has at least one veterinarian.&#13;
The Veterinary Stations are not on the PISGpayroll. However, they are providedwith funds to&#13;
undertaketasks onbehalf o fthe Ministry such as vaccinations, tuberculosis tests, blood sampling&#13;
and other measures from the Prophylactic Program, which i s issued by the MAFRD.Thirteen&#13;
veterinarians are providing veterinary services inminority enclaves. The inspectors are&#13;
responsible for both animal health and veterinary public health. They are also responsible for&#13;
organizing the control measures incase o f an outbreak o f infectious disease. The Chief&#13;
Veterinary Officer (CVO) o f the KVFA i s based inPristina, and since 11 September 2006 has&#13;
beenreporting officiallyto the OIE.&#13;
&#13;
120.     Veterinary laboratory:InKosovo there is one Veterinary Laboratory, locatedin&#13;
Pristina. The Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory (KVL) i s the scientifichpporting establishment o f&#13;
the Veterinary Service, and it is equipped and staffed for animal disease monitoring and&#13;
surveillance besides food safety control. This laboratory i s authorized by the MAFRDto deal&#13;
with Avian Influenza. The ownership o fthe building is not clearly defined betweenthe Faculty&#13;
o f Agriculture, the MAFRDand the Municipality. KVL has only very limited space for&#13;
laboratory units and the four laboratory rooms are fairly well equippedthrough donations from&#13;
the World Bank, FA0 and other donors. The KVL is staffed with five veterinarians, two&#13;
technicians, and 7 support personnel. The size and structure o f the existing KVLbuildingdo not&#13;
meet the demands o f a Central Veterinary Laboratory for the whole o f Kosovo. Apart from the&#13;
fact that bio-security is not guaranteed, all corridors and rooms, where potentially contaminated&#13;
and infectious material is stored andworked with, are open to the public. There is no Virology&#13;
section. Food and feed examinations are carried out inthe same laboratory. There are no isolated&#13;
premises for rabies or BSE diagnosis. Necropsy is performed ina room without adequate&#13;
facilities for intensive cleaning and disinfection; the security system does not meet international&#13;
standards. Safety and Quality Control, and Good Laboratory Practice are not introduced. The&#13;
limited space inthe buildingfor veterinary laboratory activities and the structure o f the building&#13;
itselfwill not allow the introduction o f at least bio-safety level 2, which i s the minimumbut&#13;
absolutely essential for this kind o f diagnostic activities. The KVL i s not sufficiently staffed with&#13;
academic, technical and support personnel.&#13;
&#13;
121.     Educationandpostgraduatetraining:There is one Veterinary faculty inKosovo which&#13;
is located within the Agricultural University inPristina. It trains 20 students for the veterinary&#13;
profession yearly. Since the Veterinary faculty inPristina has no accreditation, students have to&#13;
take their last year inAlbania.&#13;
&#13;
122.     Animal identificationandregistrationof animalholdings:An EUfundedproject for&#13;
animal identification and registration was completed between 2004 and 2006. Although the&#13;
project was focused on bovines it has the capacity to be extended for other species and holdings&#13;
and to be upgraded for disease control purposes, subsidy and compensation payments. Animal&#13;
HealthModules would provide usefulinformation on the animal health status to support&#13;
surveillance and monitoringprograms and trade inanimal commodities.&#13;
&#13;
123.     Animalhealthprogram:The PISGfinance measures against some infectious diseases&#13;
included inKOSOVO'S    prophylactic plan; Avian Influenza i s one o f them. For 2006 the PISGhave&#13;
allocated  300,000 for Avian Influenzato the MAFRD. The PISG recognize the need for&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
expansion o fhumanresources and capacities inthe veterinary sector, but does not have&#13;
resources available to support hiringof additional staff. This component o f the project will&#13;
support the existing temtorial veterinary service structure as the most effective means to achieve&#13;
major impacts inHPAIprevention and control, and sustainable improvements inanimal health in&#13;
general.&#13;
&#13;
A.      EnhancingHPAI PreventionandPreparednessCapability&#13;
&#13;
A1: Strengtheningthe PolicyRegulatoryEnvironment.&#13;
&#13;
124.    The Veterinary Law was adopted in2004. It regulates the organization, functioning and&#13;
financing o f the veterinary service and inspectorate, and the authority and the duties o f the&#13;
veterinary administration. This subcomponent will provide technical assistance to support the&#13;
much-needed development o f sub-laws, regulations and protocols inaccordance with OIE&#13;
standards and guidelines.This will include developing guidelines and manuals, especially in&#13;
chapters and articles o f the law dealing with disease control, surveillance, and eradication. This&#13;
component will be extended to develop new regulations, sub laws and statutes ensuring&#13;
coordinationbetweenthe private and the public veterinary sector.&#13;
&#13;
A2:     ImprovingHPAI PreventionandControlPlanning.&#13;
&#13;
125.    This subcomponent will provide technical assistance inthe field o f animal epidemiology&#13;
and animal disease diagnosis, to help improve KOSOVO'S     animal disease control capacity and&#13;
address the inter-relatedissues needed to achieve effective response. A multidisciplinary team&#13;
composed o f local and international experts and local veterinary staff will monitor, improve and&#13;
update the existing "Kosovo Operational Plan for Control and Eradication of Avian Influenza"&#13;
on a regular basis. The project will support participation o f Veterinary Services officials and&#13;
project staff inregional and international information exchange and dissemination o f expertise&#13;
on avian influenza. The short-term objective is improvement of capacity and preparedness for&#13;
preventingand controlling HPAI.The long-tern objective is to lay down a framework for&#13;
dealingwith other zoonotic diseases inKosovo, such as brucellosis, rabies, tuberculosis, and&#13;
others. The plan shall represent a flexible base for developing project implementation strategies&#13;
and monitoring tools.&#13;
&#13;
B.      StrengtheningDisease ControlCapacities:ImprovingSurveillance,Diagnostic&#13;
CapacitiesandAppliedResearch.&#13;
&#13;
126.    This component will support activities to strengthen KOSOVO'S    veterinary services and&#13;
enhance animal disease surveillance, diagnostic and research capabilities. The component will&#13;
have the following sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
B1:     StrengtheningVeterinary EpidemiologicSurveillance.&#13;
&#13;
127.   There are seven district veterinary inspectors for the five regions. The inspectors are&#13;
responsible for both animal health and veterinary public health. There are no specially trained&#13;
epidemiologists.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128.    This subcomponent o f the project will provide technical support to update the relevant&#13;
legislation to strengthen intra-service coordination. This will include institutional and&#13;
organizational restructuring and training o f staff aimed to speed surveillance dynamics and&#13;
information flow. This subcomponent will also assist upgrading o fpriority infrastructure&#13;
(equipment,materials and supplies, and technical assistance).&#13;
&#13;
129.    Duringthe project special emphasis will beplaced on detectingcaseso fsuspected HPAI&#13;
inpoultry andother domestic animals byintroducingappropriate early detectionsystems at the&#13;
village level, paying special attention to high-risk areas.&#13;
&#13;
130.    Capacity buildingfor veterinary epidemiology surveillance will be supported through the&#13;
establishment o f a Veterinary EpidemiologicalUnit (VEU), composed o fthe 5 regional&#13;
veterinary epidemiologists, and the two veterinarians at the Central Administration who will be&#13;
responsible for communication with the Veterinary Directorate and the Laboratory. The project&#13;
will provide technical assistance for establishing the VEU with an internationalveterinary expert&#13;
on epidemiology and animal disease surveillance. Financing o fthe VEU will be coveredby&#13;
project funds for 18 months, after which it will be fully integrated into the territorial veterinary&#13;
service and supported by the PISG. Project finalization will include final evaluation and further&#13;
recommendations for maintenance, continuation and updates o f the unit.The PISG will commit&#13;
to maintainingthe VEU after completion o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
131.    These veterinarians will be responsible primarily for monitoring poultry health, initiating&#13;
the response to any suspect cases and reporting regularly to veterinary agencies at the territory-&#13;
wide level. Secondarilythey will be incharge o fmonitoring any indicative changes inbehavior&#13;
o fwild birds, incooperation with staff o f the Ministry of Environment operating at the regional&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
Animalhealthmonitoring&#13;
&#13;
132.    Animal health monitoring is focused on migratory birds and autochthonic wild birds and&#13;
on poultry respectively.&#13;
&#13;
            A.     Monitoring of migratory and autochthonic wild birds&#13;
            Concerning the number and varieties o fmigratory birds and their stays inKosovo, so&#13;
            far there have been no large-scale ornithological studies other than the counting&#13;
            performed in2005/2006. The project will assist intracking o f the total number and&#13;
            varieties o fwild birds, as well as o fthe periods o f their stay on the territory o f&#13;
            Kosovo. The regional epidemiologistswill make weekly visits to the locations at risk&#13;
            where migratory birds land because o f large water surfaces, and collect all necessary&#13;
            data gathered by ornithologists, hunters, gamekeepers, owners o f fishponds and&#13;
            workers employed at fishponds. They will report cases o f any diseased or dead birdto&#13;
            the locally competent veterinary service. They will carry out regular meetings with&#13;
            representatives o f huntingorganizations to give them instructions to place wild birds&#13;
            inenclosures andhow to keep themproperly.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The epidemiologists will also monitor the wild birds regarding:&#13;
            0   locations at risk (main wild birdresting spots); main pathways (Sites where&#13;
                interactionwith poultry is most likely to occur)&#13;
            0   periods at-risk: Post nuptial arrival; Post molt arrival; Early fast passage towards&#13;
                Africa; Late slow passagetowards Mediterranean; Arrival o f wintering birds;&#13;
                Winter still period; Departure o fwintering birds; Slow passage from&#13;
                Mediterranean; Fast passage from Africa; Departure o f wanderers towards&#13;
                breeding sites; and Breeding stationary period (from May to July).&#13;
&#13;
            Basedon this they will do hazards identification and risk analysis&#13;
&#13;
            B.      Monitoring ofpoultry health&#13;
            The poultry business inKosovo canbe classified into two groups: highly intensive&#13;
            andbackyard farming. The level o fbio-security at intensive farms is satisfactory, so&#13;
            that the possibility o f AI introduction i s relatively low. Unfortunately, this is not the&#13;
            case for small farms, which are considered to be the points o f highest risk. Another&#13;
            important activity for the assigned regional epidemiologists is targeted monitoring&#13;
            and registration of all holdings andbirdswithin 3 kmofwater areas (lakes, rivers,&#13;
            etc.), even holdings on which poultry is kept for own consumption. Taking into&#13;
            consideration the number of villages (1,432), size o f the territory and topography o f&#13;
            some regions, problems could be expected inthe rapid implementation o f the&#13;
            measures and the consequent control.&#13;
&#13;
B2:     Strengthening of Diagnostic Capacities and increasing Bio-Safety levels.&#13;
&#13;
133.    This subcomponent will support the Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory (KVL) inits efforts&#13;
to provide systematic, safe, quick and reliable diagnostic capacities. The KVLhas the capacity to&#13;
perform routine influenza diagnostic tests (ELISA andRAIV Ag. Type A specific antigen in&#13;
avian cloaca resp. scattered faces, swabs Immunochromatographic test.)&#13;
&#13;
134.    The Kosovo Diagnostic Laboratory has inadequate processing capacity. Although some&#13;
sophisticated laboratory equipment for routine tests exists, it i s only partly installed due to poor&#13;
infrastructure o f the laboratory, and upgrading o f the existingbio-safety level is impossible. A&#13;
new site has been identifiedbut no funding is available for construction. There is a need for the&#13;
followingbio-safety equipment:lamina flow cabinets, negative pressure, micro filters, containers&#13;
for decontamination o fwasted water, double ended autoclave for decontamination o f materials&#13;
etc. The laboratory technicians need training for GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) and on HPAI&#13;
differential diagnosis.&#13;
&#13;
135.    Diagnostics kits and equipment related to the improvement o f testing capacity for HPAI&#13;
have beenprovided to the KVLbyUSAID funding for 2006, meaningthat the Project will only&#13;
cover such expenses for the period after this. As identified immediate need o f the IVRthe project&#13;
will support acquisitionofdiagnostic kits for RAIV Ag. Type A specific antigen inavian cloacal&#13;
resp. scattered faces, swabs Immunochromatographic test and ELISA.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
136.     The project will support the buildingo fthe future Avian InfluenzaDiagnostic laboratory&#13;
to BSL-2+by allocating resources for the related civil works including appropriate laboratory&#13;
infrastructure. The creation o f the new laboratory will be accompanied by an appropriate design&#13;
and construction, with technical assistance provided through an animal health laboratory expert.&#13;
Inthe longterm this investmentwill strengthen the diagnostic capacities ofthe laboratory and&#13;
the capabilities o f KVFA to control the disease.&#13;
&#13;
137.     Support through this subcomponent will include technical assistance for: standardization&#13;
o fmethods and procedures for laboratory diagnostics; improvement o f laboratory safety and&#13;
waste disposal procedures; strengthening bio-safety duringtransportation o f samples;&#13;
strengtheninghumanresource capacity; strengtheningcommunication betweenveterinary and&#13;
human laboratories at the central and regional level; and preparation o f guidelines and training&#13;
programs for the establishment o f the quality control systems and bio-safety manual.&#13;
&#13;
138.     The project will support the establishment o freliable means for transportation o f samples&#13;
from Kosovo to the international veterinary reference laboratories for diagnosis confirmation.&#13;
&#13;
B3: StrengtheningAnimalDiseases InformationSystems.&#13;
&#13;
139.     This subcomponent will provide technical assistance to support the development o f&#13;
analytical capacity and a uniform disease information system inKosovo, so that KVFA can&#13;
participate inglobal disease information sharing. This will enable the KVFA to comply with its&#13;
obligations to OIE, thereby contributing to better global and regional disease control and&#13;
eradication. The system will be linked with rapid and standardized methods o f routine analysis o f&#13;
surveillance data, which will be able to detect important changes inthe H5N1situation, and&#13;
promptly supply this information to relevant personnel. The project will use software developed&#13;
for this purpose by FAO.&#13;
&#13;
C.       StrengtheningHPAIControlProgramsandOut,breakContainmentPlans&#13;
&#13;
140.     Control o fHPAIin animals i s the principal means to reduce opportunities for human&#13;
infection, and consequently reduce opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge. This&#13;
subcomponent will support the implementation o fHPAIoutbreak containment actions. The&#13;
overriding objective for the overall Kosovo veterinary services i s prevention o f outbreaks, and&#13;
eradication o fthe disease at the source o f infection before it becomes endemic.&#13;
&#13;
141.     Despite the progress made by the PISGintackling this threat, and the intensive support&#13;
provided by the international community, the campaign to reduce levels o f H5N1 virus treat is&#13;
still at an early stage. Major territory-wide and international efforts are still needed to prevent&#13;
HPAI infection inpoultry and to contain infection when it occurs. Long-term political&#13;
commitment, continued vigilance and substantial technical and financial assistance are essential&#13;
to reduce the risk o f epidemics. Singular success stories should not lead to complacency and&#13;
relaxation but serve as examples for possible implementation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C1: Targeting Virus Eradication at the source.&#13;
&#13;
142.    The project will support the Kosovo veterinary services to mobilize the necessary&#13;
physical and humanresources to respondquickly andeffectively to contain and eradicate HPAI&#13;
outbreaks at the source. The steps that need to be inplace include: (a) destruction o f infected and&#13;
at-risk poultry; (b) compensation to farmers and industrialpoultry producers at an agreed upon&#13;
market-orientedprice; (c) disposal of carcasses and potentially infective materials ina bio-secure&#13;
and environmentally acceptable manner; and (d) control o f movement o fbirds andproducts that&#13;
may be infected, includingcontrols at the interface of infectednon-infected areas and border&#13;
controls.&#13;
&#13;
143.    The project will equip KVFA with mobile culling and rendering equipment for an AI&#13;
epidemic situation as well as portable disinfection equipment and disinfectants shown on the&#13;
attached tables. This is will enable to cull birds at the infection point, to destroy their carcasses&#13;
with minimumhazard for further spread o fthe virus troughtransport vehicles and to disinfect the&#13;
infectedpremises immediately following the international best practice.&#13;
&#13;
144.    As previously mentioned, the project will support the creation of a Veterinary&#13;
Epidemiological Unit. Apart from epidemiological and research tasks, the unit will be&#13;
responsible for leading the emergency response inHPAIoutbreaks, helping to coordinate the&#13;
above tasks. It is envisaged that the unit will have at a central level two trained epidemiologists,&#13;
preparedat any time to travel to reportedpotential outbreak areas with the required equipment&#13;
and trained staff. The project will support creation, training, staffing andprovision o f equipment&#13;
for this unit.Note that vaccination may be considered ifthe disease becomes endemic and&#13;
previous approach fails. Therefore the Kosovo Veterinary Service should undertakemeasures to&#13;
ensure access to the EUvaccine bank. This subcomponent will support the KVFA indeveloping&#13;
the vaccination strategy. The PISGwill guarantee funding for vaccination purchase, delivery and&#13;
storage.&#13;
&#13;
145.    A manual on technical procedures for emergency response to HPAIoutbreaks will be&#13;
developed, disseminated and incorporated inthe field veterinary services. The manual might&#13;
include guidelines on: access to suspected infectedpremises; preliminary investigation; sampling&#13;
and transportation o f samples; confirmation o f HPAI; depopulation and disposal o f dead birds;&#13;
disposal/destruction o f infected materials; disinfection o f infected premises; additional&#13;
investigations, data collection and sampling; list of equipment to be used along with its location&#13;
and quantities; list o f disinfectants along with the guidelines for their use; and information flow&#13;
charts and contact information for all relevant personnel.&#13;
&#13;
C2:Human safety&#13;
&#13;
146.    Veterinarians, public health personnel and individuals participating inHPAI control and&#13;
eradication activities are at increased risk o f exposure to HPAI, due to prolonged, direct contact&#13;
with infectedbirdsand/or contaminatedsurfaces. They can minimize their exposure by using&#13;
adequate protective equipment and following standard set regulations and safety protocols.&#13;
Surveillance and monitoring o f exposed workers i s also important.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                        48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
147.       This subcomponent will support provision o f training ofpeople likely to be indirect&#13;
contact with birds and other animals that may carry the live virus (veterinary and extension field&#13;
staff involved inthe identification o f the disease, farm workers involved inculling andin&#13;
disposing ofmanure, and laboratory workers involved invirus isolation and diagnosis).&#13;
Adequate resources will be allocated for training and equipment (bio-safety hoods and&#13;
appropriate personal protective gear andclothing). Inaddition, all veterinary staff and workers&#13;
will be vaccinated against seasonalhumaninfluenza.&#13;
&#13;
C3: CompensationFund&#13;
&#13;
148.       A successful livestock cullingprogram, critical for preventingthe spread ofHPAI&#13;
outbreaks, canbe implementedonly iffarmers cooperate and submit their animals for culling.&#13;
Farmers require credible assurancesthat they will be compensatedfor the loss o f their poultry.&#13;
InKosovo there is a legalbasis for compensation for culled livestock, as well aswritten&#13;
procedures for implementationo f compensation. Compensation has already been conducted for&#13;
other diseases. However, experience o f compensating farmers for culled livestock to date has&#13;
only been used on a much smaller scale, and could be overwhelmed inthe event o f a serious&#13;
HPAIoutbreak.&#13;
&#13;
149.       The component will set up the CompensationFundand will ensure adequate legal basis&#13;
for compensation ofthe culled birds inthe case of HighPathogenic Avian Influence outbreak.&#13;
Through this component appropriate mechanisms will be established to implementeffective&#13;
compensation ifcullingmeasures are employed. The component will use adjusted practices o f&#13;
current compensation practices. Adjustedpractices will be determined and will be appropriate&#13;
for small scale poultry owners and industrial poultry. The necessary fiduciary and control&#13;
mechanisms for the fund will be set up within the Project Team that i s composed with the two&#13;
epidemiologists who are going to work together under the CVO. Together with the Lead Project&#13;
Coordinator they carry on the work i s needed for the compensation whenever an outbreak will&#13;
happen. The CompensationFundwill be funded to US$537,300 equivalent.20The necessary&#13;
fiduciary and control mechanisms for the fundwill be set up within the Operations Manual. (See&#13;
Appendix 3b for details).&#13;
&#13;
Component111: HumanHealth(US$968,500 equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
150.       This component will support a national program to develop and implement short and&#13;
medium term prevention o f an outbreak o fHPAI among humans and reduce the impact o f a&#13;
pandemic virus. It will comprise three subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
A.         Enhancingcoordinationandprogramplanning:&#13;
&#13;
151.       There have beenno known or recordedoutbreaks o f avian influenza among humans in&#13;
Kosovo to date. Nevertheless, the PISG are well aware o f the potential risks o f avian influenza&#13;
and the possibility o foutbreaks occurring and is working with externalpartners to address these&#13;
risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2o This i s estimatedto cover around percent of the poultrysector, depending on the exact market value o f poultry&#13;
                                    5&#13;
as determinedat the time o f compensation.This is inline with other World Bank funded projects.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                          49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
152.     The MOH and the Institute o f Public Health (IPH) inPristina havejointly prepared a&#13;
draft action plan for the prevention o f an influenza pandemic, which i s divided into three periods&#13;
and six phases depending on the stage o f the pandemic to be addressed (based on WHO&#13;
recommendations).21 The plan, described briefly at the beginning o f the Technical Annex,&#13;
foresees the establishment o fthe Commission for InfluenzaPandemic Management (CIPM)&#13;
(whose members will include representatives from the Office o fthe Prime Minister, MOH,&#13;
MAFRD,IPHandothers), to manage andimplement allnecessarymeasures and&#13;
recommendations incase o f an outbreaklpandemic. At this stage the plandoes not clearly define&#13;
coordination mechanisms to be put inplace within the health sector or with other sectors, or&#13;
coordination mechanisms with public health structures inNorthMitrovica. Timely&#13;
implementation o fthe planwill dependon good coordination, strong political support and&#13;
continued interaction with the UNhternational organizations inKosovo.&#13;
&#13;
153.     Currently, legal and ethical frameworks coherent with international legislation, such as&#13;
the International Health Regulations, have not beenestablished, thoughthe PISG is inthe&#13;
process o f issuingtwo laws to this end (Communicable Disease Law and Public Health Law).&#13;
Policies and regulatory frameworks to ensure implementation and monitoring o f influenza&#13;
pandemic prevention and control activities are not yet inplace and no administrative structures&#13;
have been officially instructed to ensure future enforcement. Despite this, the MOHhas already&#13;
assigned an avian influenza coordinator, a public awareness officer as well as two planningand&#13;
health policy officers.&#13;
&#13;
154.     The project will fund and provide technical support for: (i)          strengthening intra-sectoral&#13;
command and sector coordination mechanisms; (ii)               regular revisions, updating and further&#13;
detailingofthe M O H contingency planwith a view to more clearly define operational priorities&#13;
as well as roles and responsibilities o f stakeholders within the health system; (iii)             drafting o f&#13;
territory-wide strategic plans for strengthening public health surveillance and disease control&#13;
systems, and drafting administrative procedures inline with the International Health Regulations,&#13;
as per WHO recommendations, to build a platform o f shared knowledge and ability to respondto&#13;
rapidly-evolving health emergencies worldwide; (iv) preparation o f the training program for&#13;
health sector staff (lab, investigationteams, staff inhospitals, family physicians); and (v) regular&#13;
simulation exercises.&#13;
&#13;
155.     The project will also finance and provide technical support to develop a hnctional&#13;
framework for data sharingbetween Pristina andNorth Mitrovica and other Serb minority&#13;
enclaves to ensure appropriate dialogue between the respective systems operating inthese areas&#13;
at the operational level. This will be carried out inclose consultation with WHOAJNICEF, who&#13;
will help oversee implementation and ensure sustainability. Not less inimportance is the need for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*'The planproposes having the Kosovo Coordination Room (lead by the Prime Minister), the Veterinary and&#13;
Healthcare Coordinating Body (lead by the Ministers o f Health and Agriculture), and the Municipal Coordination&#13;
Room(lead by the Mayor) play active roles in ensuring timely coordination o f activities and legislations. It also&#13;
proposes activating a Central Room for Avian Influenza Outbreak Monitoring and Preventionto work closely with&#13;
expert committees in the ministries o f Health and Agriculture, Emergency Situation Department, Emergency&#13;
Services for Civil Protection as well as others.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the project to also support efforts to coordinate between the veterinary and health services&#13;
especially inthe Northwhere reporting is inconsistent.&#13;
&#13;
156.     This subcomponent will also finance the development o f a detailed implementationplan&#13;
for "social distancing" and "hospital clean-out" measures to be activated incase o f an epidemic.&#13;
Social distancingmeasures will typically be activated on advice from health professionals and&#13;
institutions, although they will not bethe enforcing agencies. The implementation plan will have&#13;
therefore to explicitly define institutional responsibilities for activation and enforcement o f social&#13;
distancingmeasures and for inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination. Additional&#13;
preventive actions that will complement social distancing (such as personal hygiene promotion&#13;
through various communication channels, including hand-washing and proper cooking, and&#13;
distribution and use o fmasks) will also be supported. Support will also be provided for the&#13;
preparation o fmeasures to be taken to protect health care workers and ensure that they will be&#13;
willing and can continue to be at work ina pandemic situation.&#13;
&#13;
B.       StrengtheningPublicHealthSurveillanceSystem (Human health)&#13;
&#13;
B1:Active SurveillanceSystem&#13;
&#13;
157.     There i s an existing territory-wide surveillance system inplace, which i s coordinated&#13;
through the central IPH.The system is currently functioning for all communicable diseases but&#13;
does not yet incorporate specific routine human influenza surveillance. Inthe current system,&#13;
reporting occurs at the regional level through the regional network o f IPHs; however, private&#13;
sector engagement insurveillance activities is very limited. To this end, the MOHhas recently&#13;
issued an administrative order obligating private practices to report all communicable diseases.&#13;
Although there are currently seven outbreak investigationteams inKosovo, coordination with&#13;
the veterinary side is limited, especially inthe North, impeding the active search for human cases&#13;
should an outbreak in animals occur.&#13;
&#13;
158.     The PISG's draft action planfor the prevention o f an influenza pandemic has correctly&#13;
identifiedthe need for establishing an early warning system to be part o f the general surveillance&#13;
system. This comes with the aim to promptly reporting avian influenza cases through: (i)&#13;
promoting detection o f human cases; (ii)   detectinghuman cases incase o f animal epizootics; (iii)&#13;
supporting epidemiological research; (iv) coordinating clinical research; (v) strengthening risk&#13;
assessment; and (vi) strengtheningthe territory-wide strategy for prevention and control.&#13;
&#13;
159.     The project will finance and provide technical assistance for the establishment o f an&#13;
active influenza surveillance system through: (a) drafting o f guidelines, procedures and case&#13;
definition; (b) establishing a hospital based sentinel system for influenza like illness; (c)&#13;
strengthening the reporting system o f infectious diseases with technical assistance from WHO;&#13;
(d) training o f IPHstaff and other healthprofessionals including family doctors andprimary care&#13;
physicians; (e) assisting with transport;  (0provisionofpersonalprotective equipmentand       other&#13;
materials (disinfectants); and (g) communications equipment for the 30 municipalities to assist in&#13;
buildinga computerizednetwork for the reporting system and operatingwith the newly&#13;
developed WHO surveillance software (replacing the old EpiInfo program) for which technical&#13;
assistance from WHO will be provided.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B2: InfluenzaLaboratory&#13;
&#13;
160.    The Laboratory o f Microbiology is locatedwithin the premises o f the IPH. It is&#13;
accredited by WHO for Measles andRubella, but does not currently have the capacity to&#13;
function as a reference laboratory for routine influenza diagnosis. Despite this, the laboratory has&#13;
spaces that can be renovatedto allow for the establishment o f a reference influenza lab. This will&#13;
require, inaddition to other things, equipment (including a RT-PCR), protective personal&#13;
equipment for lab staff, kits and reagents and consumables for the typing and sub-typing o f&#13;
specimens.&#13;
&#13;
161.    The project will fund and provide technical support for establishing an Influenza&#13;
laboratory through: (i)     renovating 2 spaces inthe microbiology laboratory fitted with negative&#13;
pressure systems, HEPA filtration and a system for treatment o fwastes; (ii)           developing&#13;
guidelinesand procedures for testing; (iii)      training o f lab staff on diagnostic testing, virus typing&#13;
and subtyping, as well as, trainingregional IPHstaffto enable them to adequately and safely&#13;
collect and send specimens; (iv) providingequipment (notably a real time PCR), kits and&#13;
reagents, triple packages, cool packs, viral transport media as well as other lab consumables&#13;
includingbio-safety boxes for the transport o f samples; (v) providing protective personal&#13;
equipment for laboratory staff; and (vi) providing disinfectants for laboratory staff. Finally, the&#13;
project will also finance sendingspecimens for confirmation to an internationalreference&#13;
laboratory such as the European Influenza Center inLondon, UK.There is an obvious need to re-&#13;
train the laboratory staff for them to fully implement protocols andprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
C.      StrengtheningHealthCare ResponseCapacity&#13;
&#13;
162.    At this point intime the systemappearsrelatively unprepared to respond to the first&#13;
human cases, let alone cope with a pandemic. Seasonal influenza vaccination remains limited&#13;
andthe M O Hhas avery limited stock o fanti-virals. The situation inthe hospital makes it&#13;
impossible to properly isolate and take care o f highly infectious patients. Healthworkers will&#13;
need to be re-trained inmany aspects and will need to be provided with protective personal&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
C1:     Vaccinations&#13;
&#13;
163.    This subcomponent will help expand regular seasonal flu vaccination for targeted priority&#13;
groups22(as defined inthe draft action plan). It will also finance the development o f a detailed&#13;
logistical (procurement and distribution) plan for mass vaccination should an HPAIvaccine&#13;
become available. The project will also finance the procurement o f antibiotics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22Includingchildrenbelow 5 andpersons over 65 years of age, residents ofnursinghomes, childrenand adults with&#13;
chronic disorders of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systemor chronic metabolicdiseases or immuno-&#13;
suppression.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C2:     Anti-virals&#13;
&#13;
164.     This subcomponent will provide support for the purchase and distribution o f anti-viral&#13;
drugs in accordance with WHO guidelines and arrangements and adoption o f measures to avoid&#13;
inappropriate use (to limit the development o f antiviral resistance). One type o f drug is&#13;
recommended for treatment o f avian influenza infections: neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir&#13;
and zanamivir). However, the availability o f influenza anti-viral medications is limited.&#13;
Therefore, planningby health agencies is needed to assure effective use o f available drugs. To&#13;
this end, support will be provided for developing guidelines and educating physicians, nurses,&#13;
andother healthpersonnel before and duringthe pandemic to promote effective use o fthese&#13;
drugs. Giventhe current worldwide shortage o fthe drug and the limitedstock available to the&#13;
countries, prioritywill have to be given to population groups most exposed to immediate risk.&#13;
The project will finance stockpiling o f 1,500 doses, to be replenishedas and when necessary&#13;
duringthe duration o fthe project. Incase a needdoes not arise, the funds allocatedto the&#13;
procurement o f anti-virals may be reallocated to the other subcomponents as deemed necessary.&#13;
&#13;
C3: Strengtheningmedicalservices:&#13;
&#13;
165.     Assistance will be provided to the MOH for preparedness planning and strategy&#13;
development to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential community services.&#13;
&#13;
166.     To this end, the project will provide: (a) support for the establishment o f eight isolation&#13;
rooms, including two negative pressure isolation rooms inPristina and one inNorth Mitrovica;&#13;
(b) equipment o fthe isolationrooms; (c) emergency stocks o f.antibioticsand consumables, (d)&#13;
protective equipment for health workers; and (e) the training and retraining o f staff at all levels&#13;
o f the health care systemto include, among others, training on rapid response and infection&#13;

&#13;
167.    Incase ofa declared influenzapandemic, this component will finance emergency imports&#13;
identified as necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared&#13;
as part o f project implementation. These imports are likely to include: (i) pharmaceuticals and&#13;
vaccines; (ii) medical supplies and equipment; (iii)  communication equipment, supplies and&#13;
information campaigns; (iv) food and water containers; and (v) protective clothing.&#13;

168.    Staff capacities inthe PISG are good and there are staff inplace that are capable o f&#13;
managing and implementing the project inthe central administration provided they receive&#13;
adequate support.&#13;
&#13;
169.    Though existing capacity will be usedas much as possible to implement the project and&#13;
form the Project Team, this component will support and complement these capacities for&#13;
effective implementation and management o f the project.&#13;

&#13;
171. This subcomponent will support staff and institutional strengthening and costs associated&#13;
with project management and coordination.&#13;
&#13;
172.    To support the executive capacities o f the AI Working Group to implement the project,&#13;
this subcomponent will support the work o f a Lead Project Coordinator (also responsible for the&#13;
Animal HealthComponent) and two Project Coordinators (one each for the Public Awareness&#13;
andInformation Component and the HumanHealth Component), all assigned inSeptember 2006&#13;
from existing staff. The Project Coordinators will be responsible for implementing decisions o f&#13;
the AI Working Group and ensuring that the appropriate entities are taking the necessary actions,&#13;
for coordinating the responses o f different entities, and for liaising with donors working on HPAI&#13;
response. They will be responsible for compiling the Project Operational Manual, preparing and&#13;
reviewing Annual Work Plans and ensuringcoordination and linkages across relevant agencies&#13;
and international partners, and for overseeing Monitoringand Evaluation. The three&#13;
Coordinators will be responsible for coordinating with the relevant PISG departments to guide&#13;
andmonitor project implementation at the central and local levels. Therelevant PISG&#13;
departments will be responsible for assisting with preparation o f Annual Work Programs,&#13;
budgetsandreportingas needed. The full Terms ofReference for the Project Coordinators will&#13;
be included inthe Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
173.    The Project Coordinators will receive additional management training to facilitate their&#13;
transition to a coordinating and management role inthe project. The Coordinators will also&#13;
collaborate with and receive support ifnecessary from the UNHPAICoordinator (funded from&#13;
UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, FAO, UNDevelopment Coordinator budget and reporting to the UN&#13;
Development Coordinator), who will sit inthe Office o f Public Safety (OPS), Office o f the&#13;
PrimeMinister, and who will assist the OPS inpreparedness and contingency planning.&#13;
&#13;
174.    The Project Coordinators will also be supported by the following staff appointed for&#13;
overall administration, procurement and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation:&#13;
&#13;
            0   One of the epidemiologists hired under the Animal Health Component will be&#13;
                assigned as DeputyProjectCoordinator,to take care o f some o f the day-to-day&#13;
                responsibilities o f the Lead Project Coordinator. This individual will also receive&#13;
                management training.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                A second epidemiologisthiredunderthe Animal HealthComponent will be&#13;
                assigned as Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist (see below).&#13;
                A local Procurement Specialist will be hiredunderthe project, andwill be&#13;
                assisted by existing staff inthe Public Procurement Agency, who have experience&#13;
                inprocurementfor World Bankprojects. The Procurement Specialist will also be&#13;
                assisted by an internationalprocurementconsultant duringthe initial phase o f&#13;
                project implementation, and the technical procurement expertise o f existing staff&#13;
                inthe KVFA.&#13;
                FinancialManagement will be carried out by a consultant to be hired for the&#13;
                project.&#13;
&#13;
175.    The project will also provide a budgetfor consumables, and will cover the costs o f&#13;
project audit andan operational review for the internal control framework and procedures,&#13;
especially for the CompensationFund, and the inventories o f drugs, vaccines, medical and&#13;
veterinary equipment, and other sensitive and/or expensive assets.&#13;
&#13;
176.    The project will also procure the services o f WHO and UNICEFto implementthe project&#13;
activities inminority enclaves where the PISGhave limited access, as and when necessary.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
&#13;
177.    M&amp;E will constitute a critical part o fproject implementation. M&amp;Ewill be carried out at&#13;
all administrativelevels, while responsibility for overall M&amp;E for the project will be given to&#13;
one o f the two epidemiologists hired under the Animal Health component. This individualwill&#13;
spend the majority o fher or histime on M&amp;Eduringthe project, after which their&#13;
epidemiological duties will become paramount.&#13;
&#13;
178.    This subcomponent will provide support for M&amp;E activities through the following:&#13;
&#13;
B1: Training&#13;
&#13;
179.    This subcomponent will support traininginparticipatory monitoringand evaluation at all&#13;
administrative levels; a mid-termevaluationworkshop; and development o f an action plan for&#13;
M&amp;E and replication o fsuccessful models. Itwill support the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
                Training inM&amp;E.&#13;
            0   Developing an M&amp;E plan for the project.&#13;
            0   Implementation o fbaseline studies.&#13;
            0   Mid-term evaluation o fthe project.&#13;
            0   Ongoingparticipatory monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
            0   Final project evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
180.    These activities will be conducted by the epidemiologist tasked with perfonning M&amp;E&#13;
for the project.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B2:    Program Monitoring and Impact Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
181. The M&amp;E epidemiologist will also be responsible for developing project monitoring and&#13;
impact evaluation assessments. Two types o f M&amp;E are envisaged:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)     Monitoringo fproject implementation. Relevant data will be collected from line&#13;
       ministries and other implementation agencies and then compiled into semi-annual or&#13;
       quarterly progress reports (as the case may be) focusing on status o fphysical&#13;
       implementationby component, use o fproject funds and monitoring indicators. Specific&#13;
       surveyswill be conductedto obtain data for this purpose. Annual expenditurereviews&#13;
       will be conducted to assess PISG commitment to strengthen the public health functions as&#13;
      measured by budgetary allocations and their distribution by activity.&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)    Impact evaluation. The aim o f evaluation i s to assess whether the interventions&#13;
       are effective or the Program i s having the desired impact. The evaluation will include&#13;
       bothquantitative and qualitative aspects and be conducted on an annual basis. The&#13;
       quantitative aspects will rely on new information systems and surveys implemented as&#13;
      part o f the various components o fthe project, currently existing data sources, and&#13;
       primary evaluative data collection efforts. The goal o f the qualitative aspect o f the&#13;
       evaluation will be to document perceptions o fprogram managers, staff, patients, and&#13;
       local and territory-wide leaders.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Appendix3b: CompensationPlan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
182.    Earlydetectionandreporting, as well as rapidresponse, depend critically on the poultry&#13;
owners to report very quickly any sick and/or dead poultry to veterinarians. Without adequate&#13;
compensation arrangements inplace, poultry owners have no incentive to do this, andwill fear&#13;
that with the destruction o f their poultry they will lose their valuable capital.&#13;
&#13;
183.    Within the Animal Health component there will be a CompensationFund, accompanied&#13;
but an adequate legal basis for compensationo fthe culledbirdsinthe case o f an outbreak o f&#13;
HPAI. Through this component appropriate mechanisms will be established to implement&#13;
effective compensation ifculling measures are employed. The component will use adjusted&#13;
practices o f current compensation practices. Adjusted practiceswill be determined andwill be&#13;
appropriate for small scale poultry owners and industrial poultry. The necessary fiduciary and&#13;
control mechanisms for the fund will be set up within the Project Team&#13;
&#13;
184.    Current procedures for compensation for culled livestock inKosovo are relatively well-&#13;
developed. The Law number 21/2004, The Law on Veterinary Services, confirms the right o f&#13;
farmers to be compensated for the culling o f contagious animals and animals at risk, inorder to&#13;
prevent spreading o f the disease, and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. In&#13;
order to compensate the farmers the following documents/steps are required with the current&#13;
practices&#13;
&#13;
    -   The form for the reporting o f the suspicious contagious disease which i s filled by the&#13;
&#13;
    -   local veterinarian&#13;
        Minuteswhich describe the situation inthe property with the poultry suspected to be&#13;
        contagious filled by the regional inspector&#13;
    -   Chiefo fAnimal Health Section inthe KVFS prepares a report for suspicion for the&#13;
        presence o f the disease.&#13;
    -&#13;
    -   Availability o fthe laboratory results.&#13;
        Decision o fthe ChiefExecutive Office o f the KVFA for establishing o f the commission&#13;
        to assess the damage inorder to determine the amount for compensation&#13;
    -   Assessment report based andproposal for compensation bymarket value&#13;
    -   Decision for the compensation&#13;
&#13;
185.    Inthe event ofanHPAIoutbreak inKosovo, the Projectwillprovide support for culling&#13;
and elimination o f infected and at-risk poultry, with compensationto farmers and commercial&#13;
poultry producers based on the existinglegal framework. The ordinance/order/by-law [currently&#13;
being drafted and to be ready by theAppraisal mission] for culling and compensation will&#13;
determine inadvance the compensation values by type o fpoultry (rather than requiring a&#13;
commission to determine the value on a case-by-case basis). Part o f the ordinance will be the&#13;
compensation amount which will be determined every 6 months, and will be defined as average&#13;
value o fmarket values separately for back yard chicken and industrial chicken. Accurate lists&#13;
will be kept o f all poultry culled, so that the culling committee can calculate the compensation&#13;
that will go to each poultry owner. Strict requirementswill apply to recording, reporting and&#13;
verification o fpoultry culling, compensation claims and payments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
186.      The compensation fund will be financed by the World Bankproject up to the amount o f&#13;
US$537,300 equivalent. The usage o f the funds will be conditioned to the modalities for&#13;
operating the Fundbeing satisfactory established and approvedby the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Village andBackyardPoultryCulling&#13;
&#13;
187.      Inpotentialfuture cases ofoutbreak the procedures will include the following steps:&#13;
After the confirmation o f the suspicion o fthe outbreak the Chief Executive Officer o f the&#13;
Kosovo Veterinary and FoodAgency- KVFA will authorize a five member team to undertake&#13;
necessary measures for control o f disease. The team will be comprisedby a) KVFA&#13;
representative; b) Village Administrator; c) Regional Veterinary Inspector; d) Local&#13;
Veterinarian; and e) a membero f the department for emergencies (TBC). With the confirmation&#13;
o fthe disease actual culling i s undertaken. After the culling the owner and commission sign a&#13;
form defined inthe ordinanceby law /regulation that i s currently beingprepared inthree copies.&#13;
One copy i s kept by the owner, one copy i s submittedat the KVFA Ministry o f Agriculture, and&#13;
the third copy i s submitted at the Project team.   Pre-numbered forms will be given to the team&#13;
based on the number o f the properties inthe at risk region. Signed Form will be a base for&#13;
payment to the farmers. The payments will be done through bank transfer. After culling, a paying&#13;
list o f farmers per village includingthe amounts to be compensated will be announcedinpublic&#13;
space. The Project Team upon receiving the signed forms will do the actualpayments.&#13;
&#13;
CommercialPoultryCulling&#13;
&#13;
188.      At commercial poultry enterprises or extensive producers the cullingwill be done by a&#13;
team establishedby the KVFA Chief Executive, inthe presence o f the owner. The team inthis&#13;
case is same with the change where the village administrator will be substituted with a member&#13;
o f the Poultry Association. All sign a form listing the culled birds, which is completed in 3&#13;
copies. One copy of the form will be kept by the owner o f the commercial enterprise; a second&#13;
copy will be kept at the KVFA Ministry o fAgriculture andthirdwill be sent to the Project&#13;
Team. Compensation amounts are paidthroughbank wire transfers. The forms are pre-&#13;
numbered.&#13;
&#13;
DatabaseandForms&#13;
&#13;
189.      Forms will be printed, pre-numbered andkept at the Project Team. The Project Team will&#13;
keep the database o fnumber o f forms sent to each owner and commercial producer&#13;
&#13;
CompensationPayments&#13;
&#13;
190.      The parameters for payments include the following:&#13;
&#13;
     -    Compensation to the farmers will be through bank transfer. The bank accounts will be&#13;
          providedby the owner and will be entered inthe form to be signed after the culling.&#13;
          Appropriate procedures for supervisingand verifying payment will be specified in further&#13;
          detail inthe operational manual.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  58&#13;
&#13;
    -   For compensation to backyard poultry farmers the following options for compensation&#13;
        per birdcanbe considered: (i)   average market price o f the layinghens as reportedby the&#13;
        competent authority twice a year or (ii) average marketprice duringlast year (Le. the&#13;
        period before any price distortion caused byHPAI outbreaks), adjusted for inflation;&#13;
    -   For commercial producers, compensation will be provided by bank transfer.&#13;
        Compensation will be for reasonable replacement cost, i.e. for birds less than 3 months&#13;
        old at the cost o f one-day chicks, and for birds older than 3 months at the cost o f 3-&#13;
        months-old birds, at the amount as reportedby the competent authority.&#13;
&#13;
191.    The compensation amounts will be established based on the parameters inthe previous&#13;
paragraph. KVFNMAFRDwill issue an ordinance (as previously mentioned) for usage o f funds&#13;
for compensation adjusted for the HPAIoutbreak, which will include the parameters for&#13;
compensation amounts. The compensation amounts to be used inthe cases of the HPAIoutbreak&#13;
will be madepublic inadvance inthe village and the center o fthe municipality.&#13;
&#13;
Flow of Funds&#13;
&#13;
192.    Procedures need to minimize delay but ensure maximum transparency. The execution o f&#13;
payments will be done through wire transfer to the farmers, and commercial poultry producers.&#13;
&#13;
193.    The PMUwill verify that forms are complete, and on the basis o f the form specified in&#13;
the ordinance [to be approved] will execute transfers from the Compensation Fundto the&#13;
specified accounts o f the farmers and commercial producers. All transfers will be handledby the&#13;
PT.&#13;
&#13;
194.    It would be highlydesirable for compensation to be completed ina short time, for&#13;
example no longer then 7 days.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

196.    For implementation arrangements, see Section 111. A. The PISG is committed to the inter-&#13;
ministerialcooperation described therein and inthe diagram above to ensure that the Project&#13;
Team and the lines o f responsibility and reporting function effectively.&#13;
&#13;
197.    Project preparationwas conducted incollaboration with other donors, including WHO,&#13;
UNICEF, FAO, UNDP and the Office o f the UNDevelopment Coordinator, and the Project will&#13;
be integratedwith other donor responses. Specifically, the UNHPAICoordinator, supporting the&#13;
Office o f Public Safety (OPS) inthe Office of the Prime Minister inpreparedness and&#13;
contingency planning, will coordinate and collaborate as necessary with the Project Team. In&#13;
addition WHO will provide ongoingtechnical assistance (as described inthe detailed description&#13;
o f the Component 3, HumanHealth component inAppendix 3); and UNICEF will be closely&#13;
involved inimplementing Component 1, Public Awareness and Information. The Bank and the&#13;
Project Team will continue to consult with other donors to identify opportunities for coordination&#13;
as their future funds are programmed, andit is anticipatedthat the Project will be modified&#13;
accordingly to avoid overlap.&#13;

Territory Issues&#13;
&#13;
198.     An Operational FinancialAccountability Report was finalized inMay 2005. Despite&#13;
significant progress since 2001,public financial management inKosovo suffers from&#13;
fundamental weaknesses, and basic structures for financial accountability are still intheir&#13;
infancy. The overall legal framework for budgeting and budget management is largely&#13;
compatible with internationallyrecognized standards, but for some aspects it appears to be too&#13;
advanced for the current administration's capacity. Carry-over practices and weaknesses in&#13;
capacity, organization and coordination hamper budgetpreparation and undermine the credibility&#13;
o fthe budget as a policy management instrument. While treasury and cash management are well-&#13;
regulated areas o fpublic financial management, they suffer from inefficiencies. The system&#13;
through which Commitment and Payment Orders flow to ensure authorization o fpayments i s&#13;
well regulated. The Treasury authorizes commitments and paymentsbased on proposals and&#13;
supporting documentation by budget organizations and municipalities. The Treasury pays from a&#13;
single account inthe central Banking and Payment Authority o f Kosovo (BPK).&#13;
&#13;
199.     As with most public financial management functions, accounting is constrained by&#13;
limited capacity, and financial reporting needs more realistic requirements and statutory&#13;
deadlines, improved procedures, and trained personnel. Internal control and internal audit at all&#13;
levels o f government are intheir infancy. Considerable time and effort will be requiredto make&#13;
them fully operational. External audit is undevelopedand, as with internal audit, it will need&#13;
sustained external support for its development. The external audits and operational review would&#13;
be carried by auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Analysis and conditions&#13;
&#13;
200.     The overall financial management risk for the project is substantial before mitigation&#13;
measures, and with adequate mitigation measures agreed, the financial management residual risk&#13;
is rated moderate. . Table below summarizes the financial management assessment and risk&#13;
ratings o f this project:&#13;

                                            is undeveloped and, as with internal audit, it&#13;
                                            will need sustained external supportfor its&#13;
                                           development.     External audit would be done&#13;

 201.      Corruption remains a concern inKosovo. The UNReview o f Standards identifies&#13;
 corruption as "a widespread phenomenonwhere efforts to assess its extent by international&#13;
 police, prosecutors and intelligence officers has beenunsuccessful, due to clan solidarity, codes&#13;
 o f silence, language problems and inexperienced local law enforcement institutions". A World&#13;
 Bank survey o f Kosovo enterprises found that 35 percent o f surveyed firms consider corruption&#13;
 as a severe constraint to doing business. Kosovo has made some initial progress inthe fight&#13;
 against corruption inthe passing o f A Suppression of Corruption Law, and the recent reforms o f&#13;
 public expenditure management also lay the foundation for improved transparency, but much&#13;
 more remains to be done. Positively, the media and civil society are increasingly active in&#13;
 promoting accountability. Inrelation to this project, especially the compensation fund, adequate&#13;
 mitigation measures are incorporated inthe project which can be summarized as follows: (a)&#13;
 finalization and implementation o f appropriate internal controls and operational manual for&#13;
 culling and payments i s a condition o f effective - key control principles are included inthe&#13;
project (annex 3b) and annex 7, (b) transparent procedures for handlingo f culling, including&#13;
 supervision o f culling by a team o f 5 independent members and use o f an independent audit firm&#13;
 to monitor the culling and to certify the culling report for commercial farmers, (c) compensation&#13;
payment to poultry owners will be bybank transfer or postal transmission and there will be no&#13;
vouchers or animal replacements, (d) enhanced disclosure and transparency o fproject-related&#13;
 information - after culling, a paying list o f farmers per village including the amounts to be&#13;
compensated will be announced inpublic space, (e) there will be regular/annual operational&#13;
reviews to confirm the validity and legitimacy o f the compensation payments made, and (f)&#13;
instituteappropriate complaints handling mechanism.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Strengths&#13;
&#13;
202.    The significant strengths that provide a basis o freliance on the project financial&#13;
management systeminclude: (i) experience o f MFE, MOH and UNMIK o f implementing&#13;
                                    the&#13;
previous projects and satisfying Bank financial management requirements; and (ii)       the audit&#13;
reports and management letters issued by the auditors.&#13;
&#13;
 Weaknessesand Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
203.    Financial management arrangements for the project are generally adequate, but an action&#13;
is requiredto ensure that arrangements are fully satisfactory for the project, with its specific FM&#13;
needs, especiallywith respect to the CompensationFund. The following action planwill be&#13;
discussed with the Recipient duringNegotiations. Satisfactory implementation o f the action plan&#13;
will ensure the establishment o f a financial management system that fully meets requirements of&#13;
the Project and o f the Bank.&#13;

Implementing Entity&#13;
&#13;
204.    The proposed project implementation will be streamlined within the existing structures o f&#13;
the relevant govemment agencies. Inline with the government's legislative framework for AI&#13;
preparedness, responsibility for planningwill sit with the Office o f the Prime Minister, while&#13;
executive responsibilitieswill be with the AI Working Group, which sits in, and is headedby,&#13;
the MAFRD,with inter-ministerial membership from the appropriate ministries.&#13;
&#13;
205.    The lead agency inMAFRD, the Kosovo Veterinary and FoodAgency (KVFA)will be&#13;
responsible for project coordination. The Chief inthe KVFA will be also responsible for&#13;
implementingthe CompensationFund, with support fromproject FinancialManagementand&#13;
Procurement staff as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
206.    The Grant Unit o f the MFEwill be responsible for disbursement, financial reporting and&#13;
auditing o fthe project, while the KVFA will ensure that payments are approved by appropriate&#13;
staff only after services have beendelivered beforepayment requests are forwarded to the MFE.&#13;
The Grant unit incollaboration o f the KVFA will be responsible for ensuring that the Project&#13;
establishes and maintains: (i) adequate accounting systems andprocedures; (ii)     flow-of-funds&#13;
mechanisms facilitating timely disbursement o f funds and timely payments for goods, works and&#13;
services; (iii)&#13;
              regular reporting on the use o f funds; and (iv) appropriate arrangements for regular&#13;
financial audits and operational reviews on the Compensation Fund. The Grant unit has&#13;
experience with financial management under Bank-financed projects and has established sound&#13;
internal control mechanisms on the application and use of funds. However, additional internal&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  control procedures for the operation of the CompensationFund, will be developed to respondto&#13;
  the specific risks associated with the flow-of-funds mechanism envisaged under the project.&#13;
  These procedures will be outlined inthe Operations Manual.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  207.    All Commitment andPayment Orders(CPOs) producedbythe all the implementing&#13;
  entities will be submittedto the MFE. The KVFA will hire an additional staff to deal with&#13;
  financial management issues o f the project. On the other hand, the MFEwill assign a staff&#13;
  member inthe Grant Unitto bethe focal point for processing andcontrol o fpayments,&#13;
  production o f withdrawal applications, as well as producing quarterly and annual financial&#13;
  statements for the project. The Grant unit at the MFEwill work closely with the KVFA to ensure&#13;
  that quarterly interim un-audited financial reports (previously called Financial Monitoring&#13;
  Reports, FMRs), annual financial statements andother progress reports are submitted ina timely&#13;
  manner to the Bank reflecting the implementation status of the project.&#13;
&#13;
  208.    The KVFA is inprocess o frecruiting an additional staffwith adequate qualifications and&#13;
  experience.&#13;
&#13;
  Information systems&#13;
&#13;
  209.    The chart o f accounts is based on the Government's Financial Management Information&#13;
  System. This system was assessedinthe Operational Financial Accountability Report and found&#13;
  to be acceptable for the purpose of registering the necessary financial information. As the&#13;
  participants under the project fall under the umbrella ofthe Kosovo Consolidated Budget, all&#13;
  project relatedpayments would be made via the Single Treasury Account (STA), unless direct&#13;
  payments on an exceptional basis are chosen, and the accounts would be maintained as part o f&#13;
  the MFE's accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
  Accounting policies andprocedures&#13;
&#13;
  210.    The accounting books and records are maintained on a cash basis by MFEbased on the&#13;
  documentationprovided by the KVFA including additional commitment information for signed&#13;
  contracts. Quarterly and yearly project financial statements will be presented inEUR. MFEhas&#13;
  instituteda set o f appropriate accounting procedures and internal controls including authorization&#13;
  andsegregation o fduties for this project based on previous similar projects.&#13;
&#13;
  211.    The risk associated with accounting before implementation o f mitigation measures i s&#13;
  moderate.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
212.    The KVFA will be preparingbudget based onprocurement plans. These budgets will&#13;
form the basis for allocating funds to project activities and for requesting funds from the Bank.&#13;
KVFAhas experiences with planning andbudgetingfor Bank's financed operations.&#13;
&#13;
213.    The risk associated with planning andbudgetingbefore mitigation measures is assessed&#13;
as substantial.&#13;
&#13;
Compensation Fund&#13;
&#13;
214.    The Law on Veterinary Services - confirms the right o f farmers to be compensated for the&#13;
culling o f contagious animals and animals at risk, inorder to prevent spreading o f the disease,&#13;
and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. The KVFA at the MAFRDwill&#13;
manage the Compensation Fund. The necessary operational and financial details will be&#13;
developed, agreed, and included inthe Operations Manual.&#13;
&#13;
215.    The KVFA will execute gross payments from Compensation Fundto agreed agents of&#13;
each o f the affected towns/villages. The agents will make payments to individual farms and&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Control Arrangementsfor the Compensation Fund&#13;
&#13;
216.   Annex 3b sets forth the procedures for recordingpoultry culled under government orders&#13;
and for establishingand recordingpoultry owner's claims for compensation payments. A&#13;
number o f minimuminternal control procedures and risk mitigation measures will be&#13;
implementedwith respect to recordingand verifying poultryculling andclaims for compensation&#13;
payment before any flow o f funds is initiated.&#13;
       The financial and operational manuals will detail the mechanisms, as described also in&#13;
       Annex 3b, for identifyingthose eligible for compensation payments, ensuringthat there&#13;
       will beno multipleclaims. A CompensationFunddatabase will be maintainedby the&#13;
       Project to facilitate recordkeeping, claim verification, payment facilitation, monitoring&#13;
       and auditing.&#13;
       Inthe event o fgovernment-ordered culling ofpoultry, the culling andthe preparation and&#13;
       processingo f culling records and compensation claims will be done in accordance with&#13;
       the procedures detailed inAnnex 3b and summarized inparas. below.&#13;
       All forms to be used to recordpoultryculling andcompensation claims will beprovided&#13;
       bythe Project. They will bepre-numbered and recordedinthe database ofthe&#13;
       CompensationFund. All unusedforms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed&#13;
       forms, must be returnedto the CompensationFundwhen the culling records are&#13;
       submitted.&#13;
       Compensationpayment to poultry owners will be bybank transfer or postal transmission.&#13;
       There will be no vouchers or animal replacements. Paymentwill be made within a&#13;
       maximum of four weeks from the date o f culling.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
217.    The owners o f village and backyardpoultry will, incases o f outbreak, perform the&#13;
following steps: After the confirmation o f the suspicion of the outbreak the Chief Executive&#13;
Officer o fthe Kosovo Veterinary and FoodAgency- KVFA will authorize a five member team&#13;
to undertakenecessary measures for control o f disease. The team will be comprised by a) KVFA&#13;
memberb) Village Administrator c) Regional Veterinary Inspector d) Local Veterinarian and e)&#13;
a member o f the department for emergencies. With the confirmation o f the disease actual culling&#13;
i s undertaken. After the culling the owner and commission sign a form defined inthe&#13;
ordinancehy law /regulation that i s being preparedinthree copies. One copy i s kept by the&#13;
owner and one copy is submitted at the KVFA Ministryo fAgriculture. Pre-numbered forms will&#13;
be given to the team based on the number o fthe properties inthe at risk region. Signed Formwill&#13;
be a base for payment to the farmers. The payments will be done through bank transfer. After&#13;
culling, apaying list o f farmers pervillage including the amounts to be compensated will be&#13;
announced inpublic space. The Project units upon receiving the signed forms will prepare the&#13;
Commitment and Payment Orders (CPOs) and will submit to the MFE for further processing and&#13;
payments via the Single Treasury Account.&#13;
&#13;
218.     Commercial Poultry. At commercial poultry enterprises or extensive producers the&#13;
culling will be done bythe team set bythe KVFA ChiefExecutive, inthe presence o fthe owner.&#13;
The team inthis case i s same as for village andbackyard poultry culling, except that the village&#13;
administrator will be substituted with the member o f the Poultry Association. All sign a form&#13;
listing the culledbirds,which is completed in3 copies. One copy o fthe form will bekept by the&#13;
owner of the commercial enterprise; and a second copy will be kept at the KVFA Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture. Compensationamounts will be paid through Single Treasury Account, as described&#13;
above. The forms are pre-numbered. Inaddition, an independent audit firm will be required to&#13;
monitor the culling and to certify the culling report.&#13;
&#13;
219.    Flow-of-Funds Arrangements for the Compensation Fund. Procedures need to&#13;
minimize delay but ensure maximum transparency. The execution ofpayments will be done&#13;
through wire transfer to the farmers, and commercial poultry producers. Once authorized by the&#13;
KFVA,compensation payments will be effected by the CompensationFundthrough the Single&#13;
Treasury Account system.&#13;
&#13;
220.     Itwould behighly desirable for compensation to be completed ina short time, for&#13;
example no longer then 7 days.&#13;
&#13;
CompensationPayments&#13;
&#13;
221. The parameters for payments include the following:&#13;
&#13;
     -   Compensation to thefarmers will be through transfer. The bank accounts will be&#13;
        providedby the owner and will be entered inthe form to be signed after the culling.&#13;
        Appropriate procedures for supervising and verifyingpayment will be specified infurther&#13;
        detail inthe operational manual. For compensation to smallfarmers the following&#13;
        options for compensation per bird can be considered: (i)  average market price o f the&#13;
         layinghens as reportedby the competent authority twice a year or (ii) average market&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        price duringlast year (i.e. the period before any price distortion caused by HPAI&#13;
        outbreaks), adjusted for inflation;&#13;
    -   For commercialproducers, compensation will be provided by bank transfer.&#13;
        Compensationwill be for reasonable replacement cost, i.e. for birds less than 3 months&#13;
        old at the cost o f one-day chicks, and for birds older than 3 months at the cost o f 3-&#13;
        months-old birds, at the amount as reported by the competent authority.&#13;
&#13;
222.    The compensation amounts will be established based on the parameters inthe previous&#13;
paragraph. The KVFA will issue an ordinance (same one mentionedbefore) for usage o f funds&#13;
for compensation adjusted for the HPAIoutbreak, which will include the parameters for&#13;
compensation amounts. The compensation amounts to be usedinthe cases o fthe HPAIoutbreak&#13;
will be madepublic inadvance.&#13;
&#13;
223.    Reviews and Auditsfor the Compensation Fund. The KFVA will carry out, or will&#13;
arrange to have carried out, additional checks to ensure that the eligible poultry owners, and only&#13;
they, are paid infull. This will include, but not be limited to, annual operational reviews, under&#13;
TORs acceptable to IDA, to confirm the validity and legitimacy o f the compensationpayments&#13;
made. The reviewers will berequired to verify compensation claims andpayments made in&#13;
randomly selected samples o fvillages and Kosovo territories; this verification will include:&#13;
checking against the database maintained by the Compensation Fund, collecting and verifying&#13;
information available and obtained at the village level, checking with individual poultry owners,&#13;
checking forms and reports, etc. Any significant weaknesses identifiedwill be promptly&#13;
rectified inclose consultation with IDA. Inaddition, the external independent auditors will be&#13;
asked to provide an opinion on the reasonableness o f the accounting, reporting and internal&#13;
controls inrespect o fthe operations o f the CompensationFund, and the audit TORs (acceptable&#13;
to IDA) will include these specific requirements. All ineligible claims will be refunded to the&#13;
Compensation Fundand to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Internal controls&#13;
&#13;
224.    With the exception o fthe CompensationFundcomponent, for which the Grant Unitdoes&#13;
not have previous experience, the unit has maintained an effective internal control system to&#13;
ensure that project expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents are maintained;&#13;
accounts are reconciled periodically; project assets, including cash, are safeguarded, and cash&#13;
compensation grants are properly accounted for. These internal control procedures are currently&#13;
reflected intheir internal Financial Management manual. However, additional internal control&#13;
procedures for the operation o fthe CompensationFundwill be developed to respond to the&#13;
specific risks associated with the flow-of-funds mechanism envisaged under the project. These&#13;
financial manual would be revised to include control procedures for the compensation fund.&#13;
&#13;
225.    The risk associated with internal control before mitigation measures is substantial.&#13;
&#13;
Financia1Reporting&#13;
&#13;
226.    MFEwill produce all financial reports and Statement o fExpenditures (SOEs) for the&#13;
Bank.The formats ofthe quarterly interimun-audited financial reportsto be agreed during&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 negotiationswill be used for project monitoring and supervision and the formats o f these will be&#13;
 included inthe FMmanual. MFEwill produce a full set o f interimun-audited financial reports&#13;
 every three months throughout the life o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
 227.     Based on monthly reports from this system(Freebalance) MFEincooperation with the&#13;
 KFVA inMAFRDwill producethe quarterly and annual financial reportsrequired mainly&#13;
 through reports from the Freebalance system. The consolidatedreports on Statement o f Sources&#13;
 and Uses o f Funds, on uses o f funds according to organizational code, the uses o f funds&#13;
 according to sub-component, and the commitment/obligation analysis report with commitment&#13;
 and actual data, will all be producedby the Freebalance system on request o f the Grant Unit. The&#13;
 contract monitoring information will be producedby the MFEbased on the&#13;
 commitment/obligation analysis report and the information on each contract. The narrative report&#13;
 and the consolidation o f the other reports will be done by the KFVA. KVFA has experiences&#13;
 with the generation o f IFRson timelybasis.&#13;
&#13;
 228.     The risk associated with financial reportingbefore mitigationmeasures is moderate.&#13;
&#13;
 ExternalAuditing&#13;
&#13;
 229.     Current project financial statements and auditing arrangements for the previous projects&#13;
&#13;
'managed by MFEare acceptable and it has been agreed that these arrangements will be&#13;
 replicated for the proposedproject. Annual audits o f the project financial statements will cover&#13;
 all aspects o fthe project, including specific requirements for the Compensation Fund. The audits&#13;
 will be performed by independentauditors acceptable to the Bank, and inaccordance with&#13;
 International Standards on Auditing(ISA), and the Bank's guidelines on auditing. They will&#13;
 include both the audit o f financial transactions, an assessment o f the internal control, funds flow&#13;
 mechanisms, and the reasonableness o f the accounting, reporting and internal controls inrespect&#13;
 o f the CompensationFund. The annual audit reports will consist o f a single opinion on the&#13;
 financial statements o f the project, incorporating the project accounts, including Statement o f&#13;
 Expenditures (SOE); as well as a Management Letter. The auditors' TOR will be prepared by the&#13;
 MFEand cleared bythe Bank before the engagement o fthe auditor.&#13;
&#13;
 230.     The cost o fthe operational review and financial audit will be eligible for financing from&#13;
 the Grant. The KFVA and Grant Unit at the MFEwill provide the auditor with full access to&#13;
 project-relateddocuments and records, including the compensation claims database, and with the&#13;
 information required for the purpose o f the audit.&#13;
&#13;
 231.     The audit reports will be submittedto the Bank not later than six months after the end o f&#13;
 the fiscal year to which they relate.&#13;
&#13;
 232.     The following chart identifies the audit reports that will be required to be submitted by&#13;
 the project implementation agencies together with the due date for submission.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
233.    The risk associated with external audit is moderate.&#13;
&#13;
Flow of Funds and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
234.    All paymentswill bemadebythe MFE from its own sources o f funds andno designated&#13;
account will be needed. Based on the documents preparedby the implementingentities all&#13;
relevant documents will be processedby the Grant Unitinthe MFE, either to be paidby treasury&#13;
or by direct payments. The MFEwill prepare all the relevant documents in support o f&#13;
applications for withdrawal, sign it and forward to the Bank through UNMIK.Fundflow&#13;
arrangements for compensation are included inthe section 14below, but additional control&#13;
mechanism should be included to ensure funds are usedandpaid to recipients correctly.&#13;
&#13;
235.    Bank fundswill be disbursed under the Bank's transactional procedures including&#13;
Statement o f Expenditures (SoE) and direct payments. Supporting documentation for SoE,&#13;
including completion reports and certificates, will be retainedby the Borrower and made&#13;
available to the Bank duringproject supervision. Disbursementsfor expenditures above the SoE&#13;
thresholds will be made against presentationo f full documentationrelating to those expenditures.&#13;
There is no planto move to periodic disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
236.    The risk associated with funds flow and disbursement before mitigation measures i s&#13;
substantial.&#13;
&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
237.    Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial&#13;
management arrangements intwo mainways: (i)              review the project's the quarterly interimun-&#13;
audited financial reports as well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's&#13;
management letter; and (ii)      duringthe Bank's supervision missions, review the project's&#13;
financial management and disbursement arrangements (including interimfinancial reports (IFR))&#13;
to ensure compliance with the Bank's minimumrequirements. As required, a Bank-accredited&#13;
Financial Management Specialist will assist inthe supervision process. The first mission it will&#13;
be 6 months after the effectiveness.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

250.     Training of veterinarians by the Faculty of the Veterinary. Inthe scope o f the&#13;
project, veterinarians from the regional laboratories and epidemiologists from the regions will be&#13;
trained on antroposonosis (diseases transmittable from animals to humans). The training must be&#13;
provided inthe local language, and the Faculty o f the Veterinary is the only local agency with&#13;
the unique qualifications to provide this training. There are no private sector alternatives with&#13;
the facilities to carry out this training at the regional level. Eventhoughthe Faculty o f the&#13;
Veterinary is not a legally, managerially or financially autonomous agency, there is no&#13;
alternative group that can provide the training. Therefore, the concerned training activities-at     a&#13;
total cost not to exceed US$25,000 for the whole project period-will         be awarded to this Faculty&#13;
on a single source basis.&#13;
&#13;
251.     Training of medical staff by the IPH: Inthe scope o fthe project, medical staff from the&#13;
regional laboratories and hospitals and epidemiologists o fthe regions will be trained on&#13;
antroposonosis (diseases transmittable from animals to humans) and surveillance system for AI&#13;
Preparedness. The training mustbeprovided inthe local language and the Institute o f Public&#13;
Health i s the only local agency with the unique qualifications to providethis training. No other&#13;
private sector alternative i s available for such services that have facilities to carry out this&#13;
training at the regional level. Even though the Institute o f Public Health i s not a legally,&#13;
managerially and financially autonomous agency, there i s no alternative source that can provide&#13;
this training. Therefore, the concerned training activities at a total cost not to exceed US$40,000&#13;
for the whole project periodwill be awarded to this Institute on a single source basis.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Training&#13;
&#13;
252.    The Project will finance trainings for epidemiologists, laboratory staff, private&#13;
practitioners, veterinary inspectors andHQstaff. The trainings will be carried out according to&#13;
training plans, which the project coordinators will revise semi-annually and submit to the IDA&#13;
for approval prior to implementation. The expenses will be coveredunder training category and&#13;
disbursed based on SOE.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
253.    KVFA at the MAFRDwill beincharge ofthe overall project coordination and for the&#13;
procurement under the components to be implementedby both MAFRDandMOH. An&#13;
assessment o f the capacity o fthe implementing agency to implement procurement actions for the&#13;
project was carried out by PlamenKirov (ECSPS, Procurement Specialist) inNovember o f 2006.&#13;
The volume and the intensity o f the procurement planned to be completed duringthe first year&#13;
would require involvement o fhighly qualifiedprocurement staff with experience inBank&#13;
procurement. KVFA's procurement staff does not have experience with WB procurement and&#13;
hence does not have the requiredcapacity to handle the procurement under the project duringthe&#13;
initialperiod o fproject implementation. Therefore, it was discussed and agreed that the&#13;
procurementduringthe first year o fthe project will be carried out by the Public Procurement&#13;
Agency (PPA), with the participation of the procurement and other technical staff from the&#13;
KVFA andthe relevant implementingministry, and assisted bythe international procurement&#13;
advisor. Inaddition, a local procurement specialist will be hiredfor the duration of the project.&#13;
&#13;
254.    The PPA has been established about 4 years ago and has about 15 people staffwith&#13;
differentbackgrounds ineconomics, law ,engineering etc. Some ofthemhave passed training&#13;
courses inprocurement organizedby the Bank and International Labor Organization (ILO).&#13;
Some o f the people have been involved and gained some additional experience inBank&#13;
procurement duringthe implementation o f the following Bank's projects: BETA and PEMTAG.&#13;
It was indicated duringthe discussions with the PPA's management that due to the PPA's&#13;
involvement insome other projects the PPA i s currently understaffedand it does not have&#13;
enough qualified and English speaking people to handlethe additional procurement work.&#13;
Therefore, it was agreed that one procurement specialist will be hired by the KVFA and paid&#13;
from the Grant. He/she will be working under the PPA's guidance andwith the KVFA's other&#13;
technical andprocurement staff who will be incharge o f the preparation o f the technical&#13;
specifications and terms o f references. After gaining some experience during the first year o f&#13;
theproject implementationthe procurementwill be graduallytransferred to the procurement&#13;
specialist at the KVFA. The PPA's staff (two procurement experts) assigned for the&#13;
implementationo f the procurement under the AI Project have passed training courses in&#13;
procurement organizedby the Bank and ILO and have beeninvolved inthe procurement for the&#13;
mentioned Bank's projects. To assist the PPA, it was also agreedthat an international&#13;
procurement advisor experienced inBank procurement will be hiredfor about 2-4 monthsto help&#13;
and train the PPA staff andthe KVFA's staff inthe process o f the project start-up and the initial&#13;
procurement.&#13;

255.     Kosovo Operational Procurement Review (June 2004) has assessedthe risks (legal and&#13;
regulatory framework, control environment, corruption, etc.) that may negatively affect the&#13;
ability o f the implementing agencies to carry out procurement process and has rated it a high&#13;
risk.Therefore the prior review thresholds are those peculiar to ahighrisk. The recommended&#13;
corrective measures (inaddition to the above mentioned hiringo f one local and one international&#13;
procurement specialists) are that the Bank procurement specialist will: (i) provide training to the&#13;
PPA procurement staff and KVFA on the application o f the current Procurement and&#13;
Consultants' guidelines and the respective documents; (ii)  provide training to the KVFA staff on&#13;
the preparation o fthe technical parts o fthe biddingdocuments and terms o freference; (iii)&#13;
conduct a comprehensive procurement training for all project related staff as part o f the project&#13;
launch workshop; (iv) provide the PPA and KVFA with the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents and Requests for Proposals and ECA's sample formats for small procurement.&#13;
&#13;
256.     The Bank will monitor procurement activities. The Bank procurement specialist will&#13;
conduct prior andpost reviews and will provide guidance inall procurement related activities.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
257.     The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement planfor project implementation&#13;
which provides the basis for the procurement methods and selection methods, estimated costs,&#13;
prior review requirements, and time frame. This plan has been agreed between the Recipient and&#13;
the Project Team November 3,2006, and the final version will be agreed duringNegotiations. It&#13;
i s available in the Project's database and inthe Bank's external website.&#13;
&#13;
258.     The Procurement Plan will be updated inagreement with the Project Team annually or as&#13;
requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional&#13;
capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
259.     The following frequency o fprocurement supervision i s recommended: one supervision&#13;
mission per six months to visit the field and to carry out post review o fprocurement actions. The&#13;
project procurement staff shall properly collect and maintain the procurement documentation.&#13;

  KOSOVO: Avian InfluenzaControlandHumanPandemicPreparednessandResponse&#13;
                                               Project&#13;
&#13;
262.    The activities supported by this project are aimed at reducing the likelihood o f an avian&#13;
influenza outbreak spreading among poultry, reducing the likelihood that is will spread from&#13;
poultry and other animals to humans, and preparing for a possible pandemic o f H5N1 among&#13;
humans.&#13;
&#13;
263.    An outbreak o fHPAIamong poultrywould have potentially far-reaching economic&#13;
implications. A contained outbreak (such as those that have occurred inneighboring countries)&#13;
would oblige the culling o f all poultry within a three kilometer radius o f the suspected outbreak,&#13;
leading to loss o f income for farmers which would be paid for through government compensation&#13;
funds. Other economic implications include restrictions ininternal and cross-border trade, and&#13;
depressed demand for poultry products. A catastrophic outbreak, inwhich a significant&#13;
percentage o f the poultry stock i s destroyed at one time, could potentially decimate the poultry&#13;
industry, andwould cause significant economic disruption as cross-border trade comes to a halt.&#13;
The spread o f the disease among humans would have far more profound economic impact: social&#13;
distancing measures such as quarantine would be enforced, and potentially great loss o f human&#13;
life might ensue.&#13;
&#13;
264.    Calculating the economic benefits o f the project i s complicated by uncertainties regarding&#13;
the likelihood o f these events occurring and the magnitude o f the impact that they would have.&#13;
Therefore this analysis focuses on the direct financial implications o f outbreaks (both contained&#13;
and catastrophic) among poultry. Since the second order effects o f an outbreak such as restricted&#13;
trade will also have a significant economic impact, and since an outbreak among humans could&#13;
potentially have a much greater impact, this should be taken as a lower bound o f the benefits o f&#13;
project investments.&#13;
&#13;
265.    Calculating the financial impact o f an outbreak on the poultry sector requiresmaking&#13;
assumptions about the probabilitieso fcontained and catastrophic outbreaks occurring ina&#13;
givenyear. These are presented inthe "with project" scenario and "without project" scenario in&#13;
Table 1. These probabilities are based on incidence o f the disease inneighboring countries, and,&#13;
inthe "without project" scenario, probabilities increase as the disease spreadswithout a&#13;
correspondingincrease incapacity to contain it.&#13;
&#13;

  Widespread outbreak                                    25 %         20 %           15 Yo&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
266.    The model assumesthat duringcontained outbreaks 7 percent o fthe total poultry stock is&#13;
lost, and duringcatastrophic outbreaks 30 percent is lost. The total number of poultry inKosovo&#13;
i s estimated at 2 million, and the average price o f a mature bird estimated at U S $8.23Based on&#13;
the value ofpoultry lost under these scenarios, and the assumptions given above, the&#13;
witWwithout project analysis indicates that the internal rate of returnfor the project i s 18 percent.&#13;
&#13;
267.    As mentioned previously, this analysis is limitedto the short term financial implications&#13;
of the spread o fthe virus among poultry, thus representing a lower bound on the potential&#13;
economic benefits of the investment.It does not take into account the following factors that&#13;
would contribute to a higher rate of return:&#13;
         0   The analysis does not include the second order benefits o f outbreaks amongpoultry,&#13;
             for example depressed demand for poultry, damage to the industryand restricted&#13;
             trade.&#13;
         0   The analysis does not quantify the critical benefits o fpreventing the spread o f the&#13;
             virus to humans.&#13;
         0   The analysis does not take into account benefits beyond the life o f the project. It can&#13;
             be assumed that the benefits o f the project will fully come into play after the end o f&#13;
             the project&#13;
         0   The analysis does not take into account long-term benefits o f the project, which&#13;
             include strengthened capacity inthe veterinary and human health systems to prepare&#13;
             for, control and respond to HPAIinfection and other zoonoses and infectious disease&#13;
             emergencies inboth animals and humans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23 The model also assumes the poultry stock is not replaced each year. The figure o f 2 million poultry is an estimate&#13;
based on figures from late 2005 (when numbers were estimated at 2.6 million) and reported reductions since then,&#13;
which have produced revised estimates from MAFRDand the Poultry Association.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
268.    Has an environmental analysis been done? Yes [ ] No [XI.&#13;
&#13;
269.    Activities under the Project are not expected to generate significant adverse&#13;
environmental effects as they are focused largely on public sector capacity buildingand&#13;
improvedreadiness for dealing with outbreaks of avian influenza indomestic poultry andhuman&#13;
health. These prevention-focused activities are expected to have a positive environmental impact&#13;
as the Project's investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improvethe&#13;
effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handlingand testing procedures by&#13;
meeting international standards established by the WHO and OIE.&#13;
&#13;
270.    There are three environment-related issues that the project will address: the procedures&#13;
put inplace for cullinganddisposal o fpoultry; the handling o fmedicalwaste generatedby&#13;
laboratories and health care facilities; andminor civil works for rehabilitationo f laboratories,&#13;
hospitals and the construction o f the virology laboratory for the KVFA.&#13;
&#13;
Culling and disposal ofpoultry:&#13;
271.    The environmental considerations for carcass disposal typically have the potential for one&#13;
or more o f the following environmental impacts: health and safety hazards for the workers and,&#13;
thepublic; soil andwater pollution from leakages ofthe carcass waste; excavation ofmaterials&#13;
and disposal o f surplus soil/earth and other materials, risks to environmentally sensitive areas,&#13;
flora and fauna; vicinity o f the disposal site to the busy areas like roads, health centers, markets,&#13;
schools or natural reserves or historic sites; site location (avoiding flooded, eroded or sliding&#13;
areas).&#13;
&#13;
Handling of medical waste:&#13;
272.    Impacts associated with the handling o f medical waste can be minor but still it is&#13;
particularly important that wastes generated are addressed duringproject implementation and&#13;
also monitored duringoperation.&#13;
&#13;
Minor civil works:&#13;
273.    Minor civil works will be performed for the rehabilitation o f laboratory and hospital&#13;
buildingsand construction ofthe virology section o fthe Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory. The&#13;
impacts o fboth rehabilitation and construction works will be minor, and apart from any&#13;
sanitation services provided andthe disposal o f any other wastes generated, they will also be&#13;
relatively low. Inthis respect, it is particularly important that the issue o f the management of&#13;
wastes generated at these facilities i s addressed duringproject design andi s monitored during&#13;
operation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                             81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
274.     These potential hazards will be avoidedby employing international best practice&#13;
guidelines inthe culling and disposal o f carcasses and handling o f medical waste. Mitigation&#13;
measures will include: i)Careful siting, alignment and timing o fworks; ii)careful selection o f&#13;
disposal areas and methods; iii)protection o f sensitive areas within or close to site and&#13;
incorporation o f safety and environmental requirements incontract documents; iv) immediate&#13;
haltingwork invicinity o f discoveries, pending instructions from relevant authorities; v)&#13;
provision o f appropriate drainage and soil stabilization.&#13;
&#13;
275.      Since the Project supports investments incarcass disposal for culled poultry and&#13;
investments inlaboratories and hospitals it receives a B category for environmental screening.&#13;
The project operations manual (a condition o f effectiveness) will include an environmental&#13;
assessment (EA) and environmental management plan (EMP) to address these issues. A waiver&#13;
for the requirement to complete the EA and EMP duringproject preparation per para. 12 o f OP&#13;
4.01 has been granted.&#13;
&#13;
276.     Minor civil works will follow procedures similar to other projects. There is extensive&#13;
experience inKosovo inundertaking civil works projects and managingthe environmental&#13;
implications. The Operations Manual will lay out guidelinesfor the environmental impact&#13;
assessment to be followed prior to undertaking the works.&#13;

&#13;
280.    The mainbeneficiaries o fthe project will be rural families owning poultry and&#13;
commercial poultry owners involved inegg production. The beneficiaries will see improved&#13;
veterinary services resulting from the planned investments inthe Veterinary sector; and reduced&#13;
likelihood that they will lose their livestock inan HPAIoutbreak, as improvedveterinary&#13;
response capacities and improved knowledge among farmers reduce the probabilitythat&#13;
outbreaks will spread. They will also benefit from better knowledge on how to avoid being&#13;

            The Kosovo Avian Influenza Control And
            Human Pandemic Preparedness And Response Project aims to
            strengthen the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government
            (PISG)'s capacity to prevent the spread of avian
            influenza among poultry, to prevent the transmission of
            avian influenza from birds to other animals and humans, and
            to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza
            transmissible between humans. The components of the project
            are: public awareness and information; animal health; human
            health; and project implementation and monitoring and evaluation.
