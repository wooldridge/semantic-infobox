REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Mali&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agencies:           The Ministry of Urban Planming and Housing (MUH) is the Project Co-&#13;
ordinator; the Public Works Executing Agency (AGETIPE), Energie du&#13;
Mali (EDM), and the Land Auctioning Agency (ACI), are the principal&#13;
implementing agencies, with the participation of 14 local governments.&#13;
Beneficianres:      1.5 million people in 10 cities and their 14 local governments, the MUH,&#13;
the Ministry of Culture and Communication (MCC), EDM, and ACI.&#13;
Poverty:            Project Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Credit Amount:      SDR 55.50 million (US$80.00 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:              Standard IDA terns, with 40 years' maturity.&#13;
Cofinancing:        Central and local governments, ACI, and EDM will finance an amount of&#13;
US$13.50 millio:.. parallel fin.%ncing: Canada US$15.00 million; France&#13;
US$20.00 million; Germany a first slice of US$7.00 million; ICCROM&#13;
US$0.20 million; other donors have expressed interest in participating&#13;
with parallel financing (US$18.90 million).&#13;
On-Lending:         The amounts of the land development for housing (US$8.50 million) and&#13;
civil works for water supply (US$8.50 million) subcomponents financed&#13;
by the IDA Credit will be on-lent to ACI and EDM, respectively, at an on-&#13;
lending rate of 7.7% per annum, with 20 years' maturity and 5 years'&#13;
grace. ACI and EDM would bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Economic Rate       The ERRs of the subprojects range from 12% to 91%.&#13;
of Return:&#13;
Project Objectives:    The project's mair! development objective is to improve the delivery, on a&#13;
sustainable basis, of urban infrastructure services by local governments,&#13;
in partnership with the Central Government, the private sector, and com-&#13;
munities. The project's specific operational objectives are to: (a) build&#13;
local government management capacity, improve performance, strengthen&#13;
operations and maintenance, and improve planning, programming, budget-&#13;
ing, financial management, and revenue generation; (b) improve the pro-&#13;
vision of basic urban services, especially in the poorest neighborhoods,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
through appropnatt; ;.~estments in basic infrastructure (including safe&#13;
water supply) and infrastructure for economic activities, while improving&#13;
the urban environment, and creating employment through labor-intensive&#13;
works; (c) help preserve Mali's historical cities and monuments, classified&#13;
as World Patrimony, in cooperation with the United Nations Educational,&#13;
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the communities in-&#13;
volved; and (d) pursue improvements in the operation of the urban land&#13;
market, begun under the IDA-assisted Second Urban Project, while pro-&#13;
moting a progressive formal privatization of the land market, creating new&#13;
revenue sources for local governments, and guiding urban development&#13;
and expansion.&#13;
Project Description:   The proposed project would finance a five-year investment program in 10&#13;
cities and would include five components: (a) capacity-building compo-&#13;
nent (6% of the program cost): (i) to enhance local governments' mana-&#13;
gerial capacities, especially through the introduction of urban management&#13;
tools; (ii) to strengthen the monitoring capacity of the Central Govern-&#13;
ment; (iii) to provide technical and managerial assistance, equipment, and&#13;
training, to support the municipalities; (b) urban infrastructure mainte-&#13;
nance and investments (62% of the program cost) implemented by&#13;
AGETIPE on behalf of the municipalities: (i) maintenance of existing in-&#13;
frastructure, to be financed by the municipalities and the Govenmment;&#13;
(ii) rehabilitation and or construction of roads and drainage; (iii) studies&#13;
and pilot sanitation actions in Bamako and Mopti-S6vare; (iv) subprojects&#13;
to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods (in cooperation&#13;
with communities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); (v) land&#13;
development for economic activities: for marketplaces and road transport&#13;
termnals (to ue fr.nchised te the private sector), and for industrial activi-&#13;
ties (in Bamako); (c) historic cities and monuments (9% of the program&#13;
cost) to preserve and develop 15th century sanctuaries and mosques of&#13;
Timbuktu, the archeological sites and architecture of Djenne, and the sites&#13;
of Bandiagara-Dogon and their 1 Ith century culture, in cooperation with&#13;
UNESCO, private foundations of which the Getty Conservation Institute&#13;
(GCI), and the communities involved; (d) water supply in Bamako and&#13;
Mopti (13% of the program cost), implemented by EDMI to extend and&#13;
improve the transmission and distribution networks in large neighbor-&#13;
hoods; (e) land development for housing (10% of the program cost) im-&#13;
plemented by ACI: 10,000 plots to be equipped in Bamako, of which a&#13;
first program of 5,000 IDA-financed plots to be sold with secured titles&#13;
and full cost recovery, of which 3,500 would be sold by auction.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
and Risks:           The project's main benefits would be: (a) strengthened role of local gov-&#13;
ernments in urban management and project development, in the context of&#13;
decentralization; (b) improved municipal financial resources and cost re-&#13;
covery to move toward more sustainable development; (c) a high eco-&#13;
nomic return of the planned investments; (d) improved living conditions,&#13;
particularly in the poorest neighborhoods; (e) job creation; and (f) devel-&#13;
opment of local industries in construction and tourism. The principal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
project risks stem from the possibility that the Central Government may&#13;
be unable to implement the urban policy reform and decentralization, or to&#13;
remove obstacles to the mobilization and allocation of adequate financial&#13;
resources for the municipalities. These risks stem also from the inability&#13;
of local governments to increase their revenue base and tax collection and&#13;
mobilize adequate financial resources for infrastructure maintenance and&#13;
counterpart funding. The risks are mitigated by the strong sense of own-&#13;
ership demonstrated by the central and local governments during project&#13;
preparation, the planned close monitoring of performance indicators of the&#13;
municipalities and the public investment programs, and prolonged and&#13;
close coordination with other donors. They are also mitigated by: (i) the&#13;
implementation of the Economic Management Operation which supports a&#13;
program of fiscal reforms to increase domestic resource mobilization;&#13;
(ii) the instruments set up by the project to improve local resource mobili-&#13;
zation (fiscal mapping, new fee on urban occupancy, and privatization of&#13;
marketplace management); (iii) the institutional support to local govem-&#13;
ments; and (iv) on the counterpart side, the annual programs of civil&#13;
works to be financed by the project will be a function of the funds mobi-&#13;
lized by the local and central governments and spent for urban infrastruc-&#13;
ture maintenance. For the water supply component, the main risks are:&#13;
the long-term financial viability of EDM could be threatened by lower&#13;
water consumption than planned, low bill recovery rate, EDM's inability&#13;
to raise tariffs to cover its expenses, and inadequate water operation.&#13;
These risks are mitigated by introducing a "social connection" program,&#13;
instituting a service shut-off within a short time, and continuing coordina-&#13;
tion with other donors. For the land development component, the main&#13;
risk stems from the fact that ACI would not be able to find land to be de-&#13;
veloped or be entrusted with land development operations. The 750 hec-&#13;
tares of land (for 15,000 plots) to be entrusted to ACI before negotiations&#13;
mitigate this risk.&#13;
Poverty:            The project targets the poorest neighborhoods in Bamako, where 50% of&#13;
the population live below the poverty line, and the regional capital cities,&#13;
especially in the North, where 75% of the population live below the pov-&#13;
erty line. The project's safe water supply and sanitation subcomponents&#13;
would benefit the poor, especially women and children, who lack access to&#13;
clean, affordable water and waste-disposal facilities, mainly in Bamako&#13;
and Mopti. The urban infrastructure improvement would provide basic&#13;
infrastructure services that would improve the living conditions of the ur-&#13;
ban poor. Furthermore, the use of labor-intensive works' subprojects&#13;
would create 200,000 person-mronths of direct jobs, of which 70% would&#13;
be for unskilled workers. The use of new management tools would help&#13;
the municipalities better prioritize their investments and target poor areas.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF MA,LI&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. ECONOMIc DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.1   Economv. Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world with per capita income esti-&#13;
mated at about US$250 in 1995. Access to key social services, notably education, basic health,&#13;
potable water and sanitation is limited. Past growth performance was constrained by inappropriate&#13;
economic policies coupled with a long-term decline in competitiveness and terms of trade. Since&#13;
the late 1980s, the Government of Mali (GOM) has made fundamental changes in its econormic&#13;
development strategy, opting for a market-based approach in place of the centrally controlled sys-&#13;
tem that existed before. It has put in place important measures to correct distortions in the incen-&#13;
tive and regulatory system, liberalized domestic marketing and pricing, freed up intemational trade,&#13;
and withdrawn from participation in key economic sectors in favor of the private sector. It has&#13;
improved fiscal management and is continuing efforts to improve the efficiency of public resource&#13;
use.&#13;
1.2    Macroeconomic performance in 1995 was impressive. The economy grew by 6% in real&#13;
terms, the overall fiscal deficit was redu.-0 to 10.5%° of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from&#13;
13.7% in 1994, while the current-account deficit fell from 18.2% to 15.2% of GDP. Inflation was&#13;
reduced from 25% to about 12.5% in 1994. The reform measures put in place and the devaluation&#13;
of the CFA Franc (CFAF) in 1994, have helped boost Mali's medium-term growth prospects.&#13;
Real growth is projected to average about 5% per annum over the medium term allowing per capita&#13;
income growth of at least 1.5%. Agriculture will continue to be the main sector of economic activ-&#13;
ity though growth in sectors such as mining, construction, and tourism is expected to be significant.&#13;
The projected growth rates will have to be complemented by policies to help the poor benefit from&#13;
growth in order to achieve the Govenmment's objective of significantly reducing poverty. These&#13;
would include policies to improve access to education and health, support income-generating ac-&#13;
tivities, and improve basic urban infrastructure (including water), particularly in disadvantaged&#13;
urban communities.&#13;
1.3    Urban Economy.  Urban-based non-agricultural activities contributed about 66% to&#13;
Mali's GDP in 1995, compared to 45% in 1''-0 IL-dusLnal and services sectors grew at the rate of&#13;
about 5.3% and 5% per year, respectively, while the agricultural sector grew annually at about&#13;
1.7% between 1990 and 1994. Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to reach an&#13;
annual average rate of about 5%. The growth of agriculture is likely to foster the development of&#13;
related urban-based activities, such as agricultural processing, transfer and storage of farm output,&#13;
and the provision of commercial and financial services. This suggests that as Mali's national eco-&#13;
nomic performance continues to improve, the share of urban-based economic activities is likely to&#13;
expand faster than in the past. However the weakness of urban infrastructure hampers the growth&#13;
of non-agricultural activities, which require adequate access to transport networks, clean water&#13;
supply, sanitary facilities, safety from flooding, and availability of titled and improved land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B. URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.4    Demographic Trends. Mali's urban population is 2.25 million (25% of a total of about&#13;
9 mnillion, compared with an average of 35% in Westem Africa) and has grown very rapidly, at an&#13;
armual average rate of 4.8% between 1970 and 1980, and 5.2% between 1980 and 1992. The&#13;
overall population growth rate was 2.1% and 2.6 %, respectively, over these two periods. Urban&#13;
population is estimated to grow to 6.7 million (45% of the total) by 2015. The population of the&#13;
capital, Bamako, was 300,000 in 1970, increased to 900,000 in 1995, and is projected to reach&#13;
1.9 million in 2015. Only six towns have more than 50,000 inhabitants, and 69 more than 5,000&#13;
inhabitants.&#13;
1.5    Urban Povertv. As highlighted in the Bank's Assessment of Living Conditions in Mali&#13;
(1993), poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, yet urban poverty is growing at an acceler-&#13;
ated rate due to the gradual disappearance of traditional solidarity networks and difficulties in ac-&#13;
cessing food. More than 50% of the population (75% in the North) live below the poverty line.&#13;
Despite improvements introduced by the ongoing Agence d 'Execution de Travaux d 'lntere Public&#13;
pour l 'Emploi (AGETLPE) project, employment opportunities in urban areas are scarce, especially&#13;
in the formal sector. The resulting social and political pressures are fierce. Furthermore, the lack&#13;
of basic infrastructure hurts the poor the most and affects public health, as demonstrated in Mopti&#13;
and Gao, where water-related diseases are common and cholera outbreaks are recurrent (in Mopti,&#13;
15,000 cases of diarrhea in 1994, 700 cases of cholera, and 100 deaths reported in the second half&#13;
of 1995). In Bamako, water in the poorest neighborhoods is about three to ten times more expen-&#13;
sive than elsewhere, with prices ranging from CFAF 80 per cubic meter (m3) for connected houses&#13;
to CFAF 600-1,000 per m3 for water from other sources.&#13;
1.6 Instinttional Framework. At the±,^.co_i nllebi, several miristries are responsible for ur-&#13;
ban development. The Ministry of Territorial Admimstration and Security (MATS) oversees local&#13;
governments and the police. The Ministry of Finance and Trade (MFT) is responsible for tax col-&#13;
lection, including local taxes, the treasury, and land tenure. The Ministry of Urban Planning and&#13;
Housing (MUH) is responsible for city planning, control of urban development, and housing. The&#13;
Ministry of Mining, Energy, and Hydraulics, is responsible, through its regional directorates and&#13;
the public company, Energie du Mali (EDM), for urban water supply and electricity. Government&#13;
institutions responsible for urban development do not have adequate technical capacity. However,&#13;
two agencies operating in the urban sector are the exceptions: AGET1PE, the executing agency of&#13;
the ongoing Public Works and Capacity Building Project (PWCBP, Cr. 2371-MLI), and the ACI,&#13;
the land auctioning agency assisted by the Second Urban Project.&#13;
1.7    At the local level, there are 19 "communes" or municipalities (13 until 1966): 6 of these&#13;
are in the District of Bamako (created in 1974), 8 in the regional capitals, and 11 (5 created by the&#13;
transition government in 1991-92) in the secondary towns. Since 1992, these municipalities are&#13;
being govemed by elected councils and mayors and, in principle, they manage the cities. However,&#13;
they lack technical and financial capacity, with the exception of the District of Bamako which de-&#13;
veloped technical units during implementation of the two IDA-assisted urban projects. Until re-&#13;
cently, the laws have not been changed, and the Central Govemment failed to define the responsi-&#13;
bility of the municipalities, improve their finances and staffing, and supervise them. The rest of the&#13;
country is managed by Central Government officials, comprised of local representatives of the&#13;
central govenmment, 8 govemors at the regional level with regional technical departments, and ap-&#13;
proximately 286 "che'fs d'arrondissemene" or local districts. The Government is supporting a de-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
centralization reform to be implemented in 1997, with newl,' elected municipal representatives (see&#13;
para. 1.12 below).&#13;
1.8    Urban Infrastructure and Services. The 10 cities (Bamako, Gao, Kayes, Kidal, Koulik-&#13;
oro, Mopti, Segou, Sikasso, Sevare, Timbuktu), assessed during project preparation, lack basic&#13;
infrastructure and services, and the level of facilities varies among cities and neighborhoods. The&#13;
number of households connected to safe water is small, between 12% and 48%, and only 26% in&#13;
Bamnako. EDM management and performances should be improved. The water tariffs are very&#13;
low and threaten EDM financial viability. Less than 1.5% of the population is connected to sew-&#13;
age facilities. Roads (60 to 150 meters per hectare) and paved roads (5 to 33 meters per 100 in-&#13;
habitants) have deteriorated due to a lack of maintenance and many neighborhoods lack essential&#13;
roads. Bamako's 1,100 kilometer (Iam) road network has only 170 km of paved roads and much of&#13;
it is in disrepair. Drainage is inadequate, ranging from 0 to 34 meters per 100 inhabitants. Al-&#13;
though more than half of the solid waste is being collected, mainly by private enterprises and Non-&#13;
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), the municipalities' transport equipment is inadequate to&#13;
meet the rapidly growing demand, and the sector is poorly managed. Unauthorized settlements&#13;
(30% of the city in Bamako) in peripheral urban areas, which lack basic services, are absorbing the&#13;
major share of the population increase and occupying the available suburban land. Marketplaces&#13;
are crowded and they lack storage and refrigeration, lighting, latrines, and water supply. Further-&#13;
more, the cities and monuments, classified by UNESCO as Mali's World Patrimony, are threat-&#13;
ened by serious sanitation problems, the weather and pillaging, even though the monuments have&#13;
been maintained by communities for centuries. They are also not being managed and preserved&#13;
because of insufficient financial and technical capacity.&#13;
1.9   Land Markets. Conversion of land to urLan use is inadequate and land markets function&#13;
poorly, as demonstrated by the chronic illegal settlements. This is due mainly to a high degree of&#13;
centralization, the land being mainly State property, and also because of: (i) the complicated ju-&#13;
ridical status and/or inadequate institutional capacity to develop and transfer land; (ii) shortage of&#13;
medium- and long-term financing for home buyers; (iii) an al-archic and informal land market; and&#13;
(iv) insufficient cost recovery from previous urban land development and no reinvestment by the&#13;
Government of costs recovered in land development. Of the approximately 7,500 land titles deliv-&#13;
ered by the Government in Bamako during 30 years, 6,200 were delivered by ACI from March&#13;
1992 to December 1995 under the Second Urban Project.&#13;
1.10   Municipal Finance. Municipal revenues, which totaled CFAF 2.3 billion (US$4.60 mil-&#13;
lion) in 1993, for 9 of the cities, are very low. The average annual budget is CFAF 50 million to&#13;
100 million (US$100,000-200,000) in the main cities, with the exception of the District of Ba-&#13;
mako, which has a budget of CFAF 1.5 billion (US$3.00 million). On a per capita/year basis these&#13;
revenues ranged in 1993 from CFAF 390 (US$0.80) in Gao to CFAF 2,406 (US$4.80) in Kayes,&#13;
and were CFAF 2,016 (US$4.00) in Bamako, compared with US$20.00 in Abidjan, Dakar, and&#13;
Douala. The revenues are based on taxes collected by the Central Government which is improving&#13;
tax collection and fees for services (amounting to 30% to 70% of the total revenue) provided and&#13;
collected by the local governments. The revenues are insuffizient because of the narrow tax base,&#13;
the absence of household taxation, massive tax evasion, and lack of decentralization and revenue&#13;
transfer from the Central Government. The ratio of municipal revenues/Central Govemment reve-&#13;
nues was 3% in 1993, compared with an average of 5% in West Africa countries. They are also&#13;
insufficient because of inadequate cost recovery for the municipal services provided (only around&#13;
15% of the existing potential is being collected). The taxation of economic activities, included fees&#13;
collection, represents 75% to 90% of municipal revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.11 Municipal expenditures: Municipal operating expenditures (recurrent budget) ranged in&#13;
1993, on a per capita/year basis, from CFAF 404 in Timbuktu to CFAF 2,843 in Kayes. Invest-&#13;
ment expenditures ranged from CFAF 0 in Timbuktu to CFAF 522 in Bamako, and to CFAF 757&#13;
in Kayes. The expenditures are not managed efficiently because municipal governments do not&#13;
have adequate technical and managerial resources. In addition, the municipalities lack an institu-&#13;
tional framework that defines in detail the responsibilities and allocates the resources between the&#13;
Central and local governments. {The financial information and data by city are provided in the&#13;
Project File, including the audits of the District of Bamako and the municipalities of Mopti, Se-&#13;
gou, and Sikasso.)&#13;
C. SECTOR POLICY AND STRATEGIES&#13;
1.12   Decentralization Reform. The most important Government policies related to urban de-&#13;
velopment are the decentralization reform mandated by the February 11, 1993 law (Conditions de&#13;
la libre administration des collectivites territoriales) and the January 27, 1995 Code (Code des&#13;
collectivites territoriales) to be implemented progressively from 1997, with newly elected repre-&#13;
sentatives. The Mission de Decentralisation, set up in 1993, is defining the relations between the&#13;
central and local govemments, and the division of resources, assets, and tasks, with the help of&#13;
several donors. The 1993 Law established the general legal framework for decentralization. It&#13;
includes: (a) reorganization of the administration of the country; (b) transfer of executive compe-&#13;
tencies, responsibilities, and resources; (c) police; (d) municipal resources; and (e) supervision of&#13;
the municipalities by the Central Government. The 1995 Code defined: (a) the notion of local and&#13;
national affairs; (b) composition of the h. -9l governmerts; (c) other decentralized institutions; and&#13;
(d) supervision by the Central Governmenit. Tlifee otlher laws were enacted in the fall of 1996: (i)&#13;
constitution and management of the municipalities land; (ii) municipalities' fiscal resources; and&#13;
(iii) fiscal resources of the District of Bamako and its municipalities.&#13;
1.13 Urban Development Polica. On September 25, 1996. the Government adopted an urban&#13;
sector policy letter (Annex 1) defining the action plan for improving delivery of urban services by&#13;
the municipalities on a sustainable basis, with greater competition and reliance on commercial&#13;
practices, private sector participation, and responsiveness to demand. The Government is also re-&#13;
viewing the Land Tenure Law and the Land Development Code to make them more operational and&#13;
to open the way for private land development. A parallel action would be undertaken to modernize&#13;
the agencies in charge of land management and provide them with appropriate management instru-&#13;
ments. The Government and municipalities are also assisting NGOs in targeted programs to im-&#13;
prove the delivery of urban infrastructure services to the poor. The Government is improving tax&#13;
collection and local governments will need to make greater efforts to improve their revenues, espe-&#13;
cially the collection of fees. The Government has undertaken a five-year investment programming&#13;
study (for 1997-2002), the first attempt to allocate public investments more efficiently for Bamako&#13;
and the regional capitals. The Government is also willing to protect and develop Mali's cultural&#13;
heritage. These actions reflect the five key policies of the Govemment: (i) strengthening the eco-&#13;
nomic linkages between urban and rural productive sectors, by improving the economic perform-&#13;
ance of towns and villages; (ii) increasing access to basic services; (iii) improving the living condi-&#13;
tions of the poor and vulnerable groups; (iv) building the local capacities for urban planning and&#13;
management; and (v) preserving and developing Mli's cultural heritage.&#13;
1.14   Donor Assistance in the Sector. Extemal donors, mainly the European Union (EU), Can-&#13;
ada, France, and Germany, are supporting the preparatory stage of the decentralization process.&#13;
These same donors are also involved in subprojects in secondary towns. A donor round-table&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
meeting was held in Bamako in July 1996; Canada, France, and Germany expressed interest in&#13;
participating with parallel financing. Other donors are planning to finance urban subprojects as&#13;
well, for example, Japan may support improvements in Bamako's water supply. UNESCO is sup-&#13;
porting the Government in preserving Mali's cultural and historic cities and monuments classified&#13;
as World Patrimony.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.15   Lessons leamed in Mali and othel West African countries which are relevant to the pro-&#13;
posed project would include: (a) the use of delegated contract management in public works&#13;
through AGETIPE is efficient for executing municipal projects; this would continue under the pro-&#13;
posed project; (b) the auctioning of serviced and titled plots by ACI is highly transparent, allows&#13;
full cost recovery, and transfers land to the private market; this mechanism would be expanded in&#13;
the project; (c) the revenues generated by auctioning plots could have been used to develop new&#13;
lands instead of simply turning over these revenues to the State budget; to avoid this in the future,&#13;
the statutes of ACI were amended to transform it into a commercial land development agency;&#13;
(d) municipalities should be more efficient in providing sustainable infrastructure services; to&#13;
achieve this, their capacity should be strengthened as proposed in the project; (e) client ownership&#13;
and responsiveness to demand need to receive adequate and early attention; beneficiaries, stake-&#13;
holders, municipalities, and executing agencies have played a leading role in project identification,&#13;
preparation, and design; (f) operation and maintenance: the ability of funding operation and main-&#13;
tenance has been a deteminant of the sc.ale of new investments; the maintenance subcomponent, as&#13;
part of the counterpart funds from the Government and the municipalities, would have a positive&#13;
impact on ensuring adequate spending for maintenance; and (g) the management and financial im-&#13;
provement in EDM are essential to achieve the project objectives.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA iNVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.16   The proposed project supports the main objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) discussed in January 1995 aiming to: (a) build local capacity in the municipalities and&#13;
Central Govemment; (b) continue to support the generation of urban employment for workers with&#13;
little or no skills and help reduce poverty; (c) increase participation of the private sector by con-&#13;
tracting out services, consultancies, works, and transferring land to private ownership; and&#13;
(d) provide infrastructure that is essential for economic activities. Previous IDA urban projects&#13;
have been effective in developing urban policy and this project would be a logical next step for&#13;
continued support in the sector. A new ur' ½n project and a second AGETIPE project, planned in&#13;
the CAS, were merged into this project for more efficient programming of investment and mainte-&#13;
nance and it includes the preservation of Mali's World Patrimony.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2. TUE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PREPARATION AND STAKEHOLDERS&#13;
2.1    The proposed project, a follow up to the IDA-financed Second Urban Project and the&#13;
PWCBP, was identified in July 1994 and appraised with other donors in June-July 1996. Feasibil-&#13;
ity studies, financed mainly by a Japanese grant (Y 74,200,000) and IDA (AGETLPE), were pre-&#13;
pared by the Govemrnment with the help of several consulting firms. Parallel studies were financed&#13;
by France. Project preparation activities were followed up by a Coordinating Comrnmittee effec-&#13;
tively chaired by the MUH. A comprehensive participatory process, involved several ministries, in&#13;
addition to the Decentralization Mission, the Mayors' Association, the local govenmments and their&#13;
councils, village councils, local NGOs, Neighborhood Associations, Mosque Associations, unions,&#13;
and beneficiaries. Local and foreign consultants worked together to obtain the relevant data and&#13;
information, and prepared base maps and data, urban master plans, and infrastructure investment&#13;
programs for the 10 cities and the historic and cultural cities. AGETIPE, ACI, and EDM, the fu-&#13;
ture implementing agencies, and NGOs assisted in the preparation of the different components, and&#13;
particularly in prioritizing investment needs. Project preparation included lessons leamed from the&#13;
previous Second Urban and ongoing PWCB Projects.&#13;
2.2    The proposed project responds to the Government's decentralization and regional planning&#13;
policy which aims to promote progressive decentralization and complements rural development&#13;
efforts, supported by a parallel donor-assisted five-year investment program in the urban sector in&#13;
eight regional capital cities (Gao, Kayes, Kidal, Koulikoro, Mopti, Segou, Sikasso, and Timbuktu),&#13;
the District of Bamako, and Djenne. Other donors are already involved in secondary cities and&#13;
towns.&#13;
B. OBJCTIS&#13;
2.3    The project's main development objective is to improve the delivery, on a sustainable ba-&#13;
sis, of urban infrastructure services by local govemments, in partnership with the Central Govem-&#13;
ment, the private sector, and communities. The project's specific operational objectives are to:&#13;
(a) build local govemment management capacity, improve performance, strengthen operations and&#13;
maintenance, and improve planning, programming, budgeting, financial management, and revenue&#13;
generation; (b) improve the provision of basic urban services, especially in the poorest neighbor-&#13;
hoods, through appropriate investments in basic infrastructure (including safe water supply) and&#13;
infrastructure for economic activities, while improving the urban environment, and creating em-&#13;
ployment through labor-intensive works; (c) help preserve Mali's historical cities and monuments,&#13;
classified as World Patrimony, in cooperation with UNESCO and the communities involved; and&#13;
(d) pursue improvements in the operation of the urban land market begun under the IDA-assisted&#13;
Second Urban Project, while promoting a progressive formal privatization of the land market,&#13;
creating new revenue sources for local governments, and guiding urban development and expan-&#13;
sion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
C. DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.4    The five-year investment program in the 10 cities would includefive main components.&#13;
{For a complete list of subprojects, see Annex 2) (The amounts shown below are base costs).&#13;
Capacity Building (US$ 7.4 million, 6% of the program cost, of which US$7.1 million will be&#13;
financed by IDA).&#13;
2.5    The project places particular emphasis on urban management instruments, sectoral re-&#13;
forms to strengthen local governments, and capacity building. The following program will be im-&#13;
plemented in coordination with and in addition to the program developed by the Mission de Decen-&#13;
tralisation, with the support of other donors. The Technical Assistance (TA) program will be&#13;
provided by short-term consultants, principally local consultants, engaged with a clear definition of&#13;
objectives and results. Groups of local and external consultants will be encouraged to bid jointly,&#13;
in an effort to develop Malian private-sector capacity. The training subproject will be implemented&#13;
mainly in Mali's existing schools or training centers. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for most of&#13;
these studies were prepared before negotiations; all the studies will be carried out before the end of&#13;
the second year of credit effectiveness.&#13;
2.6    This component would include:&#13;
(a)    Studies for (i) the establishment of a new urban fee; (ii) review of the land tenure&#13;
law; (iii) land management by local governments; and (iv) the management of&#13;
marketplaces and transport stations;&#13;
(b)    Detailed mapping of the regional capitals and an update of the urban infrastruc-&#13;
ture inventory; this subcomponent will help quantify the current and projected in-&#13;
frastructure deficit, the annual investment and maintenance programs, and the&#13;
status of urban land and its management;&#13;
(c)    Assigning addresses to streets and lots and collecting fiscal data in the four more&#13;
important cities to help land management and tax collection; this subcomponent&#13;
will be extended to the other regional capital cities during the course of the project;&#13;
an evaluation of the population will be made by neighborhood during data collec-&#13;
tion;&#13;
(d)    Setting up of accounting systems in the municipalities of Mopti, Segou, Sikasso&#13;
and the District of Bamako, the latest six months after credit effectiveness to im-&#13;
prove financial management; this subcomponent will be based on management&#13;
audits carried out in the municipalities of Bamako, Mopti, Segou, and Sikasso;&#13;
(e)    Training for local and Central Government staff and elected officials in institu-&#13;
tional matters (financed by other donors in coordination with the Mission ea la De-&#13;
centralisation), legal aspects of land management and regulation, municipal man-&#13;
agement, programming, finance, accounting, budgeting, contracting, procurement,&#13;
and environment, among others;&#13;

(h)    Training for private enterpnses and consulting firms staff.&#13;
2.7    Basic Urban infrastructure (US$83.3 million, 62%  of the program  cost, of which&#13;
US$41.3 million will be financed by IDA, including the environmental action plan).&#13;
(a)    Maintenance of existing urban infrastructure (US$6.60 million). This subcom-&#13;
ponent will befinanced by the Government (61%) and the municipalities (39%o)&#13;
as project counterpart funding; the municipalities' participation will focus on es-&#13;
tablishing priorities for infrastructure maintenance and making it part of the pro-&#13;
gramming,  budgeting, contracting, and monitoring process; the maintenance&#13;
would mainly cover roads, drainage, sewage, lighting, traffic lights and signs,&#13;
marketplaces and transport terminals (when they are not managed by the private&#13;
sector), schools, and health centers in coordination with the concerned administra-&#13;
tions (not managed by the Central Government or private communities);&#13;
(b)    Urban road rehabilitation and construction, including drainage (US$38.50 mil-&#13;
lion of which US$24.00 million is IDA-financed), the rehabilitation of existing&#13;

scripts, among other activities.&#13;
2.9    Drinking Water supply in Bamako and Mopti (US$17.80 million -13% of the program&#13;
cost, of which US$10.40 million will be financed by IDA) to extend and improve the transmission&#13;
and distribution networks for large neighborhoods in: (a) Bamako: 15,000 new houses -150,000&#13;
inhabitants- will be connected to the network which will be extended by 150 km of pipes and 3 res-&#13;
ervoirs totaling 6,000m3; and (b) Mopti: 1,000 new houses (87% increase) --15,000 inhabitants--&#13;
will be conmected to the network which will be extended by 32 km. This component includes stud-&#13;
ies on water prices and technical aspects, and the implementation of the project environmental ac-&#13;
tion plan; funds for this subcomponent would be on-lent to EDM, the implementing agency.&#13;

D. COST AND FINANCING&#13;
2.11    The total cost of the program, including infrastructure maintenance, is estimated  at&#13;
US$154.60 mnillion, excluding taxes in Mali, but including duties (about US$8.70 million). The&#13;
proposed IDA credit of US$80 million equivalent will finance 52% of the program. The program&#13;
costs are summarized in Table 2.1. The IDA project costs are separated out in Table 2.2, and a&#13;
detailed breakdown by component is given in Annex 3. The exchange rate used in the estimate is&#13;
US$1 = CFAF 515; estimated inflation rates are shown in Table 2.3. The foreign exchange com-&#13;
ponents total about 83%, the only local currency costs being for local workers.&#13;

Per Operational Manual OP. 6.50 of May, 1996&#13;
2.12   The project financing plan is summarized in Table 2.4, with further details provided in&#13;
Annex 4. The Central Govermnent, local govemments, and agencies will finance an estimated&#13;
amount of US$13.50 million: US$8.70 million from the Central Govenmment, US$3.00 million&#13;
from local government revenue, US$1.00 million from EDM, US$0.80 million from ACI. A num-&#13;
ber of donors have announced their intention to participate in financing the proposed program.&#13;
These include Canada (US$15.00 million), France (US$20.00 million), Germany (an initial&#13;
amount of US$7.00 million), and the Intemational Centre for the Study of the Preservation and&#13;
Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) (US$0.2 million). All cofinancing will be on a paral-&#13;
lel basis, with each participating donor managing its own subprojects in accordance with its re-&#13;
spective rules. Should the extemal contributions to program financing be insufficient, the Central&#13;
or local govenmments will increase their participation, or the program will be reduced accordingly.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
portions will be on-lent to the following beneficiaries, at a 7.7% interest rate, with 5-year grace-and&#13;
a 20-year repayment period, the foreign exchange risk being assumed by the beneficiaries:&#13;
(a)   the portion related to the civil works water supply subcomponent, (Bamako and&#13;
Mopti, US$8.50 millicn) will be on-lent to EDM; and&#13;
(b)   the portion related to land development for housing (US$8.50 million) will be on-&#13;
lent to ACI.&#13;
2.14   These arrangements will be covered in subsidiary loan agreements between the Govem-&#13;
ment and EDM and ACI, respectively. Signing of subsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to IDA,&#13;
are conditions of credit effectiveness. Project agreements have to be signed between IDA and the&#13;
on-lending beneficiaries.&#13;
2.15   Recurrent costs related to the subprojects carried out for the municipalities will grow from&#13;
CFAF 257 million m Year 2 of the project, to CFAF 881 million in Year 9, and stay at that level&#13;
later. The project will provide additional revenues which will grow from CFAF 241 million in&#13;
Year 2 of the project to CFAF 1,297 million in Year 9 of the project. The result will be positive&#13;
from the year 2 and will total CFAF 2,769 million from by +he Year 9. The project financial fore-&#13;
cast by city, including recurrent costs and revernues, is shown in Annex 10.&#13;
E. SUSTAiNABILrY&#13;
2.16   Institutional sustainability would be strengthened undor the project by the provision of fi-&#13;
nancial and technical support to: (i) build municipal capacity to finance, operate, and maintain&#13;
infrastructure; (ii) strengthen EDM's water management capacity and review water tanrffs,&#13;
(iii) strengthen ACI and make it into an efficient land development agency; and (iv) assist the MCC&#13;
to preserve the historic cities and attract more tourists and foreign currency. Financial sustainabil-&#13;
ity of municipal investments will be achieved by: (a) enhancing programming and management;&#13;
(b) improving management and funding of maintenance; (c) increasing cost recovery service by&#13;
service and improving fee collection; (d) creating new sources of revenues (such as from market-&#13;
places, transport terminals, and the urban fee); and (e) contracting an increasing share of operation&#13;
and maintenance to the private sector. lTe progr2m's sustainability would be strengthened by the&#13;
monitoring system and training. Agreement has been reached on tariff adjustments of EDM's wa-&#13;
ter supply to meet economic and financial viability criteria. The sustainability of the market-&#13;
oriented ACI would be reinforced and extended through new land development operations, which&#13;
show a very high rate of return, as demonstrated by the 6t% ERR in the Second Urban Project.&#13;
The Mopti-Djenne-Timbuktu-Dogon area has a potential of attiacting about 20,000 tourists a yvar&#13;
and generating annual net revenues of US$10.00 million in foreign exchange. The preservation of&#13;
the main tourism attractions, the historical and cultural patrimony, is essential for tourism devel-&#13;
opment.&#13;

3. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.1    Existing agencies, which operated during the Second Urban Project and the PWCBP, and&#13;
EDM will implement the project. The M4UH would be the lead ministry for the project. MUH&#13;
would head the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) created by the May 31, 1996 law N096-&#13;
157-PM-RM. The PCC includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Territorial Adnuni-&#13;
stration, Public Works and Transport, Health, Environment, Hydraulics, Culture, and Communi-&#13;
cation, the Mission de Decentralisation, and the Association of Mayors. The PCC, which will&#13;
oversee project implementation, will be supported by a small Coordinating Unit (PCU) with four&#13;
professionals, financed by the project. The Project Coordinator would be acceptable to IDA and&#13;
appointed prior to negotiations. The PCU and municipalities will be assisted by consultants in the&#13;
area of coordination, programming, monitoring, accounting, procurement, training, and evaluation.&#13;
The PCU would also be responsible for the project contract audits, the monitoring of city con-&#13;
tracts, project performance indicators and legal covenants, quarterly reports, and coordination with&#13;
donors. The responsibilities of the different central- and local-level institutions and implementing&#13;
agencies for the project components are shown in Table 3.1.&#13;

B. LMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.2    The PCU would implement the capacity-building component, especially TA, in coordina-&#13;
tion with the concemed municipalities, agencies, the Mission a la Decentralisation, and mninistries.&#13;
The Mission a la Decentralisauon would be respons+h - for the coherence with other Decentrali-&#13;
zation assistance programs. The institutional studies would be completed and the new urban fee&#13;
(redevance urbaine) would be put into effect no later than 18 months after credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Study recommendations on the management of marketplaces to improve fee collection and cosr&#13;
recovery would be implemented, in agreement with IDA, at the beginning of the second year of ef-&#13;
fectiveness. Simple studies would be carried out by local consultants. For more complex studies.&#13;
groups of local and external consultants would be encouraged to bid jointly to help develop the ca&#13;
pacity of the Malian private sector. A draft manual of implementation would be submitted to ID132&#13;
before negotiations and the final Manual before effectiveness, including perfonmance indicators.&#13;
3.3    The District of Bamako and the concemed municipalities (outside Bamako) will manage&#13;
the Infrastructure component, with AGETIPE as implementing agency. The draft of the Frame-&#13;
work Agreement between the Goverment and AGETIPE, with the Procedures Manual attached to&#13;
it as an integral part, would be submitted to the non-objection of IDA prior to negotialions. Its&#13;
signing will take place prior to credit effectiveness. At all times during project implementation, the&#13;
Articles of Agreement (statutes) of AGETIPE-MALI, the Framework Agreement (Convention&#13;
cadre), the Procedures Manual, and the Director General of the Agency, shall be acceptable to&#13;
IDA. A project Special Account would be operated by AGETIPE and a Project Agreement would&#13;
be signed by AGETIPE.&#13;
3.4    The obligations of the local govemments under the project would be formalized through;&#13;
Municipal Contracts (contrats de ville), (see Annex 5) to be signed annually by the MUH, each ot&#13;
the municipalities, and the District of Bamako. These contracts, which include performance indi-&#13;
cators, would provide, inter alia, that the municipalities and the District of Bamako are responsible&#13;
for meeting agreed upon performance benchmarks, providing funds for infrastructure maintenance&#13;
as project counterpart funds, managing maintenance expenditures efficiently, providing adequate&#13;
staff for the project, performing financial accounting, improving management, especially for fee&#13;
collection (marketplaces, transport stations, solid-waste collection, among others). The conven-&#13;
tions signed by the District of Bamako and the municipalities with AGETIPE would be reviewed&#13;
annually, to include the annual investment programs (see para. 3.6 below).&#13;
3.5    The Government, each local govenmment, and the District of Bamako will allocate the nec-&#13;
essary resources for maintenance as indicated in Annex 3, and will guarantee their availability by&#13;
depositing these funds quarterly, in advance, into a separate infrastructure maintenance account to&#13;
be opened at a commercial bank by AGETIPE. However, the Government shall guarantee the&#13;
availability of total funds for maintenance. These accounts would be opened before credit effec-&#13;
tiveness; their provisioning is to be a condition of disbursement of the other infrastructure subcom-&#13;
ponents for each municipality. For the marketplace and transport station subcomponents, agree-&#13;
ment has been reached and it has been agreed that the new infrastructure would be managed by the&#13;
private sector in a manner acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.6    An urban master plan (plan d 'urbanisme de reference) and a program of urban infrastruc-&#13;
ture development (programme de developpement des infrastructures urbaines) were established&#13;
for each of the cities before appraisal. The main infrastructure subprojects were clearly identified,&#13;
other small subprojects will be proposed annually by the municipalities, in accordance with the&#13;
development program and selection criteria (Annex 6). The annual investment programs would be&#13;
established by July 15 each year. The PCU will organize joint annual review meetings attended by&#13;
donors, implementing agencies, and representatives of user groups and communities, to review&#13;
progress and to agree on the muucipaihties' proposed rolling investment programs for the following&#13;
year, and on the measures to be taken by each munikipality and agency. Annual amendments of&#13;
the municipal contracts would be signed at the end of July. The annual contracts with AGETIPE&#13;
and the District and the municipalities would be signed during the same period and submitted to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
non-objection of IDA. For the first year, the investment program, including the maintenance pro-&#13;
gram, has been prepared, and the draft municipal contract and the convention with AGETIPE,&#13;
have been submitted to IDA prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.7    MCC will manage the historic and cultural cities and monuments project component, in&#13;
cooperation with UNESCO, and with AGETIPE as implementing agency. This component will be&#13;
implemented in a participatory manner, in close cooperation with the associations which have safe-&#13;
guarded and maintained the monuments for centuries. An Action Plan has been prepared by the&#13;
MCC, before negotiations, defining the regulatory framework for the safeguard and maintenance of&#13;
the cities and monuments classified as World's Patrimony. This Action Plan defines the roles of&#13;
the State, the civil society, and the private sector. All the TORs for studies, consultants (including&#13;
supervision for civil works), and studies dealing with the actions on World Patrimony, must be&#13;
agreed to by UNESCO and the concemed donors. The draft Framework Agreement, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, between the MCC and AGETIPE, was submitted to IDA before negotiations.&#13;
3.8   EDM will implement the water supply subcomponent (Bamako and Mopti). It will be re-&#13;
sponsible for construction, operation, and maintenance of the water supply infrastructure built un-&#13;
der the project. Special attention will be gven to reducIrng leakage, eliminating illegal connections,&#13;
and maximizing efficiency. EDM will submit an action plan before credit effectiveness to improve&#13;
the Bamako and Mopti networks, in order to reach less than 22% of water losses by the year 200 1.&#13;
The project design would provide for a consultant to assist the EDM water department. Agreement&#13;
on performance benchmarks was reached during negotiations. The signing of a subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. Agreement on water tariffs increase from 19P8,&#13;
allowing the water department to balance its accounts by the year 2002 has been reached during&#13;
negotiations. Adoption of these tariffs by the Government and EDM is a condition of disbursement&#13;
of the water component. The national budget and the budget of municipalities and public services&#13;
would include specific amounts for water consumption determined with EDM. EDM would reduce&#13;
private parastatal receivables to below three months of billing by December 1997. A Project&#13;
Agreement will be signed by EDM.&#13;
3.9    ACI would implement the housing land development subcomponent. ACI shall at all times&#13;
ensure that its land development activities represent at least two thirds of its tumover. The signing&#13;
of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition of effectiveness. Prior to negotiations, an agree-&#13;
ment has been signed between the Government and ACI, to determine the framework for land de-&#13;
velopment. The necessary land titles for the improvement of at least 15,000 plots (750 ha) have&#13;
been entrusted to ACI prior to negotiations. All the plots developed would be sold with total cost&#13;
recovery and with secured titles, of which at least 70% by auction. The prices for auction would&#13;
be calculated in agreement with IDA. Specific criteria for the sale of the remaining 30% would be&#13;
provided in the Manual of Implementation. The implementation of the criteria would be monitored&#13;
annually through reports of ex-post study. The funds from the sale of land would be reinvested by&#13;
ACI to develop more new land to be sold, of which at least 70% by auction. The land tenure law&#13;
will be reviewed in consultation with IDA. A Project Agreement will be signed by ACI.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.10   The Malian procurement code was revised in 1995 in consultation with the Bank and is&#13;
generally sound. No special exemptions, pemits or licenses need to be specified in credit docu-&#13;
ments for Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB), as Mali allows Bank procedures to take prece-&#13;
dence over any contrary local regulations or practices. For ICB, procurement will be carried out in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
agreement with the Bank's guidelines for procurement under IBRD and IDA credit (January 1995)&#13;
and the Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and civil works will be used. For consulting&#13;
services, the Bank's standard contracts and model of letter of invitation will be used. National&#13;
Competitive Bidding advertised locally (NCB) will be carried out in accordance with procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA which allows that: (a) any bidders are given sufficient time to submit bids&#13;
(three to four weeks for contracts exceeding US$20,000 equivalent); (b) bid evaluation and bidder&#13;
qualification are clearly specified; (c) no preference margin is granted to domestic contractors or&#13;
manufacturers; (d) eligible foreign firms are not precluded from participation; (e) contracts provide&#13;
for security in an amount sufficient to protect the Borrower in case of breach of contract (without&#13;
distinction or exception); (f) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding docu-&#13;
ments are submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g) award will be made to the lowest&#13;
evaluated bidder. Table 3.2 below summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs, and&#13;
proposed methods of procurement.&#13;

0)  Of which US$24.10 million would be using AGETIPE standard procedures.&#13;
3.11      Civil Works. The project's main civil works components would be: (a) water supply in&#13;
Bamako and Mopti; (b) land development for housing in Bamako; (c) roads and drainage in Ba-&#13;
mako. These subcomponents are likely to be attractive to foreign bidders and would be tendered&#13;
through ICB procedures, at a total estimated value of about US$28.05 million. Eligible domestic&#13;
contractors bidding for civil works undei ICB would receive a 7.5% preference margin in bid&#13;
evaluation, in accordance with the January 1995 Bank Procurement Guidelines. The other sub-&#13;
components (US$25.67 million) would be tendered through National Competitive Bidding (NCB),&#13;
under procedures acceptable to IDA. Because of the number of contracts, the type of work, and&#13;
the location in the regional capitals and in dense lower income. communities, it is unlikely that these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
works would be attractive to foreign contractors (though they would not be prevented from bid-&#13;
ding). Experience from previous projects confirms that there are a sufficient number of competent&#13;
local and locally based foreign bidders to provide effective competition for these types of works.&#13;
Intemational contractors, some of which are based in Mali, would be eligible to bid for these works&#13;
both individually and/or in joint ventures with local firms. For the Infrastructure and the Historic&#13;
Cities components, contracts under the US$500,000 (totaling about US$24.10 million) will be&#13;
awarded using AGETIPE standard procedures acceptable to IDA. AGETIPE will maintain a ros-&#13;
ter of contractors eligible for NCB, according to procedures spelled out in the AGETIPE's Manual&#13;
of Procedures. IDA will review and approve the prequalification and ensure that procedures are&#13;
consistent with the Manual of Procedures.&#13;
3.12   Goods. Goods financed under the project would include trucks and equipment for solid-&#13;
waste collection and transport, light vehicles, computers, and miscellaneous equipment for munici-&#13;
palities and implementing agencies. The total value of goods is estimated at about US$2.13 million&#13;
equivalent. ICB procedures would be used in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procure-&#13;
ment (January 1995), except for contracts (totaling US$670,000 equivalent) for vehicles, comput-&#13;
ers, supplies and furniture not exceeding US$150,000 each, which would be tendered through NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. Prudent shopping based on price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
zhree reliable suppliers can be used for small quantities of goods, provided that: (a) these goods&#13;
cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$30,000; and (b) the aggregate amount does not&#13;
exceed US$200,000 for intemational shopping and US$ 100,000 for local shopping.&#13;
13   Consulting  services.    Consulting  services  financed  by  IDA, totaling  about&#13;
US$16.04 million, would be contracted in conformity with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). Services required under the project would be for the preparation of&#13;
designs, bid documents, work supervision, project management, institutional studies, capacity&#13;
'uilding, accounting, and technical and financial audits. For the use of architects and engineers,&#13;
kGETIPE will maintain a roster of firms and will select them through procedures acceptable to&#13;
LDA by using the short-list procedure in accordance with the AGETIPE's Manual of Procedures.&#13;
3.14   Review by IDA. Prior review by IDA would be required for: (a) work contracts exceeding&#13;
JS$500,000 equivalent; (b) contracts for goods exceeding US$150,000 equivalent; (c) contracts&#13;
with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; and (d) contracts with individual consult-&#13;
ants exceeding US$50,000 equivalent. The exception to prior review for consultant contracts&#13;
would not apply to TORs for such contracts, single-source hiring, assignments of a critical nature&#13;
las determined by IDA), and to amendments to contracts raising their value above the US$100,000&#13;
'1hreshold for firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants. Prior review would cover approxi-&#13;
m-tately 75% of the total value of contracts financed by IDA. Documentation for contracts under&#13;
:hese thresholds will be maintained for ex-post reviews by auditors and IDA supervisory staff. In&#13;
addition, for the subcomponents implemented by AGETIPE, for all contracts for works for which&#13;
dhere are less than three bidders or for any decision not to select the lowest evaluated bid,&#13;
AGETIPE will submit its proposal to IDA for approval prior to notifying the winning bidder.&#13;
3.15   Procurement Readiness and Procvrement .4rrangements. All ICB bidding documents and&#13;
a group of AGET1PE bidding documents for the first year would be prepared prior to credit effec-&#13;
!weness; notification of IDA's non objection on bidding documents, for items to be procured during&#13;
Iie first year of the project, subject to IDA prior review would constitute a condition of credit ef-&#13;
fectiveness. The procurement would be carried out by: (a) the PCU, supported by consultants as&#13;
necessary, for the Capacity-Building component, and the monitoring of the procurement schedule,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
(b) AGETIPE, for the Infrastructure and Historic Cities components; (c) EDM, for the Water&#13;
Supply component; and (d) ACI, for the Land Development component. AGETIPE, EDM, and&#13;
ACI are familiar with Bank procurement procedures. Detailed procurement arrangements and a&#13;
first procurement plan for key contracts are in Annex 7. A more detailed procurement plan was&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations and will be integrated in the Project Implementation Plan to be&#13;
completed prior to credit effectiveness.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.16   The project would be disbursed over a period of six years. This is consistent with the dis-&#13;
bursement profile of urban projects in Mali and the efficiency of AGETIPE which is extensively&#13;
involved as implementing agency of the Infrastructure and the Historic Cities components.&#13;
AGETIPE  is now disbursing US$36 million a year under ongoing projects. A disbursement&#13;
schedule appears in Annex 8.&#13;
3.17   The IDA Credit would be disbursed against the following categories:&#13;

3.18   As AGETIPE would implement more than 70% of the total project, it would operate a&#13;
Special Account. AGETIPE would open this account, in CFAF, at a commercial bank acceptable&#13;
to IDA. The authorized allocation would amount to CFAF 1,200 million and would cover three&#13;
months of eligible expenditures. Once the Special Account is opened, an amount of FCFAF 880&#13;
million would be deposited into it. The remaining balance would be made available as needed.&#13;
Three other Special Accounts would be operated by the PCU, EDM, and ACI. PCU, EDM and&#13;
ACI would open these Accounts at the same bank. The authorized allocations would amount to&#13;
FCFAF 150 million, 300 million, and 200 million, respectively. Three other accounts, the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
accounts, would be created for beneficiaries' counterpart contribution, with initial deposits of&#13;
CFAF 100 million each from the Govemnment. EDM, and ACI. The project accounts would be&#13;
managed by AGETIPE, EDM and ACI, respectively, and operated under terms and conditions ac-&#13;
ceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.19   Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly by AGETIPE, PCU, EDM and&#13;
ACI. The applications would include details which clearly identify the amounts withdrawn for&#13;
each beneficiary from the Special Account. All replenishment requests would be fully documented&#13;
except for: (a) contracts of less than US$500,000 equivalent for civil works, US$150,000 equiva-&#13;
lent for goods, US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firm services, and US$50,000 equivalent for&#13;
individual consulting services; and (b) operating costs which may be claimed on the basis of&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by&#13;
AGETIPE, PCU, EDM, and ACI for review by periodic IDA supervision missions and external&#13;
auditors.&#13;
3.20   AGETIPE management fees based on the works and studies carried out by AGETIPE for&#13;
the MCC, the District of Bamako, and the municipalities would be provided to AGETIPE, through&#13;
the AGETIPE management fees subcomponent and the Special Account managed by AGETIPE.&#13;
The average rate of the management fee would be less than 5%. AGETTPE's accounting will in-&#13;
clude an urban project management fee.&#13;
3.21   Tax regime. The project, with the exception of the water supply component implemented&#13;
by EDM, would be exempted from taxes (Value Added Tax, Stamp duty, Tax on insurance con-&#13;
tracts, and registration fees) but not from duties paid on imported materials (cement, wood, for&#13;
example), products (included petroleum products), spare parts, and equipment (except for the&#13;
equipment imported temporarily for project execution). All contracts for works, goods, and con-&#13;
sulting services would be bid on duties included-basis, except for temporarily imported equipment.&#13;
In exchange for the amount of duty paid on subprojects, the Government would contribute coun-&#13;
terpart fund foi the infrastrucLure and historic components. The water supply component would be&#13;
exempted from taxes and duties as indicated in the Decree No. 96-1011, dated June 20, 1996&#13;
(Arrete MFC-SG-CAB).&#13;
E. MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
3.22   During the period up to credit effectiveness, the beneficiaries would be trained to operate&#13;
the reporting system which would be set up just before credit effectiveness. The beneficiaries and&#13;
AGETIPE would provide data on their components within 15 days of the end of each quarter to the&#13;
PCU. PCU would combine this information with its own data on the centrally implemented com-&#13;
ponent to produce quarterly progress reports. These would be submitted to the PCC, the donors,&#13;
and IDA. The progress report would cover the status of each civil works contract, the status and&#13;
timing of procurement for each contract, implementation of TA, studies, and training activities,&#13;
commitments against funds budgeted for subprojects, the status of all bank accounts, cost recovery&#13;
for services, sale of plots, franchising, land titles delivered, and general municipal finances. The&#13;
progress reports would also contain action plans for each component for the coming 12 months,&#13;
updated each quarter.&#13;
3.23   Special monitoring mechanisms are put in place and will be updated to assess the effec-&#13;
tiveness of the city contracts and project agreements, especially in revenue collection for the mu-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
nicipalities and the District of Bamako, ED.M s income, and ACI's sale of plots with secured land&#13;
titles. Monitoring and performance indicators for the project are shown in Annex 9.&#13;
3.24   A mid-term review of the project would occur three years after credit effectiveness. This&#13;
would be a joint exercise of the Government, beneficiaries, IDA, and other donors, designed both&#13;
as an assessment of past experience and a forward-looking analysis of any changes or remedial&#13;
actions that may be needed to achieve the project objectives. The mid-term review would cover the&#13;
project components, implementation arrangements, and financing mechanisms, including specifi-&#13;
cally: (a) progress of physical implementation of infrastructure improvements; (b) timeliness and&#13;
efficiency of procurement of works and consultancy services; (c) effectiveness and impact of TA at&#13;
the central and local levels, (d) the maintenance component; (e) the extent to which municipalities&#13;
have maintained adequate staffing for the project; and (f) performance of the beneficiaries in mak-&#13;
ing counterpart funds available. In addition to the mid-term review, annual joint implementation&#13;
reviews would be carried out based on the monitoring and performance indicators.&#13;
F. ACCOUNTING AND AUDrITNG&#13;
3.25   The beneficianres and AGETIPE (the municipalities, the District of Bamako, PCU, EDM,&#13;
and ACI) would establish and maintain project-related financial accounts for their respective com-&#13;
ponents. The accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound and internationally recog-&#13;
nized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. Each beneficiary would prepare&#13;
annual statements of account and audit reports covering the project components for which they are&#13;
responsible, with the exception of AGETIPE which would prepare its statements and audits half-&#13;
yearly. These reports would be submitted not later than two months after the end of the financial&#13;
year. PCU would consolidate the financial and audit reports with its own annual financial state-&#13;
ment reflecting the financial performance and position of the project, by each beneficiary and as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
3.26   An independent auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to IDA on such statements would&#13;
be provided within two months for the half-yearly report, and within four months of the close of the&#13;
fiscal year for the annual reports. Special accounts, project accounts, maintenance accounts, and&#13;
SOEs would be included in the audits and specifically addressed in the audit reports. The auditor's&#13;
report would also include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting systems and intemal con-&#13;
trols, the reliability of SOEs as a basis for credit disbursements, and compliance with financial&#13;
covenants. The foregoing accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should pro-&#13;
vide adequate and timely information to IDA for project supervision. The audits will be submitted&#13;
to the PCC, each beneficiary, the donors, and IDA. Auditors acceptable to IDA, with TORs ac-&#13;
ceptable to IDA, would be appointed prior to credit effectiveness. Project accounts, AGETIPE,&#13;
ACI, the District of Bamako, and the concemed municipalities will be audited by the same auditor.&#13;
EDM will have the same auditor for IDA projects.&#13;
&#13;

4. JUSTIFICATIONS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS&#13;
A.    GENERAL&#13;
4.1    This chapter discusses the economic and social benefits, poverty alleviation, environmental&#13;
impacts, and the risks associated with the program and the project. The project will have several&#13;
direct, tangible and measurable benefits, as well as important but unquantifiable benefits.&#13;
B.    BENEFfTS AND ECONOMIC RETURNS&#13;
4.2    The project's direct, measurable benefits are based on quantifiable benefits arising mainly&#13;
from user cost savings and incremental benefits. Economic and financial justifications, including&#13;
ERR calculations and sensitivity analysis, arc estimated in Annex 10 for the infrastructure mainte-&#13;
nance, roads, sanitation, transport stations and markets, historic cities, water supply, and land de-&#13;
velopment for housing components. The results are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Overall, the project would register a positive impact on municipal finances. Net&#13;
revenues (project revenues minus expenditures) through 2005 would reach CFAF&#13;
2.7 billion, with CFAF 1.7 billion generated by the District of Bamako (63%) and&#13;
the remaining by the other six beneficiary cities. These net revenues represent&#13;
36% of total new municipal revenues from the project, with rates of 19% to 76%&#13;
among the individual cities. Additional costs generated by the project include the&#13;
municipal contribution for the maintenance of the project-financed roads and&#13;
drainage (5% to 15% of current revenues), debt payments for CFD and KfW-&#13;
financed markets and transport terminals, and improvement of municipal man-&#13;
agemtrent operations fer the three larger cities (Bamako, Sikasso, and Mopti-&#13;
Sevare). These additional expencitures are balanced by the new revenues: crea-&#13;
tion of the urban contribution (tax), increase of patente tax (license fee) collection&#13;
through registries, and actions to improve the rates of rent and fee collection in&#13;
municipal markets and transport terminals. Total new revenues would amount to&#13;
CFAF 7.6 billion, with CFAF 4.8 billion (65%) generated in the District of Ba-&#13;
mako (Table in Annex 10);&#13;
(b)    The maintenance subcomponent would have a minimum ERR of 12%, although&#13;
the final results are expected to be much higher. Actual ex-post ERRs for mainte-&#13;
nance in the PWCB (AGETIPE) project have ranged between 14% and 60%; 1.5&#13;
million inhabitants will benefit from improved maintenance;&#13;
(c)    The road subprojects show for the main subprojects in Bamako an ERR ranging&#13;
from 73% to 91% foi reihabilitation with a NPV of US$3.40 million and 41% to&#13;
67% for construction, with a NPV of US$16.00 million; the other subprojects&#13;
would be selected with an ERR of at least 12%; the benefits are based on the de-&#13;
crease in vehicle-operating costs, with and without benefits from reduction of the&#13;
transport time;&#13;
(d)    The subprojects to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods would&#13;
have, based on subprojects implemented in similar areas in Bamako and assessed&#13;
ex-post in the AGETIPE project, an ERR of at least 15%; these benefits are calcu-&#13;

lated concomitantly with the water supply component and they affect seven neigh-&#13;
borhoods, or about 50,000 inhabitants;&#13;
(e)    Marketplaces and transport stations show an ERR ranging from 14%% to 51%&#13;
depending on the city and type of construction, variations of investment costs and&#13;
values of rent, and fee collection rates; for the IDA-financed transport stations, the&#13;
NPV is US$1.70 million;&#13;
(f)    The ERR for the water supply component is calculated by estimating the incre-&#13;
mental benefits resulting from the sale of the water supplied by the addition of the&#13;
water transmission and distribution network through this project; the ERR for the&#13;
scenario of tariffs increase agreed on during negotiations is estimated at 12.0%&#13;
with a NPV of CFAF (60 ilionl.oi), using a 12% discount rate; the ERR would be&#13;
10% with 15% increase in investment cost, and 8% with 15% increase in total&#13;
costs; the first 20m3 of monthly water consumption are currently billed at 80&#13;
CFAF/m3, and consumption above 20 m3 is billed at 198 CFAF/m3; for the eco-&#13;
nomic viability of the project, to cover operating costs, these tariffs would require&#13;
a 30% increase in 1998, a 10% increase in 1999 and 2000, 20% increase in 2001,&#13;
and a further 10% increase in 2002. The water from fountains is currently billed&#13;
to the final consumer at CFAF 250/m3 to CFAF 1000/m3. Different scenarii on&#13;
tariffs increase are in the project files. This component will affect at least 160,000&#13;
inhabitants;&#13;
(g)    The land development for housing component shows an ERR of 43% for the base&#13;
case, ranging from 13% to 56%, with 10% decline or increase in rental values; for&#13;
15% cost increase thc FRR is 43% (60% in the Second Urban Project); the NPV&#13;
is US$6.40 million for the base ase, 50,000 inhabitants will live in the first Pro-&#13;
gram of 5,000 plots to be developed. It is expected that two other programs of&#13;
5,000 plots each (100,000 inhabitants) would be developed with the credit before&#13;
its total reimbursement.&#13;
4.3    The project's direct, tangible but unquantifiable benefits are:&#13;
(a)    Improved and more transparent sector management, including more effective&#13;
monitoring, planning, and programming;&#13;
(b)    Increased private sector participation in urban infrastructure services, such as&#13;
markets, transport terminals, waste collection, and public works,&#13;
(c)    Support for an urban policy consistent with overall macroeconormic objectives, in&#13;
particular as a complement to rural development, increasing the competitiveness of&#13;
cities, and alleviation of poverty;&#13;
(d)    Improvements in drainage, sanitation, waste management, and water supply&#13;
would reduce water-bome morbidity and infant mortality, contribute to better&#13;
health and thereby raise the productivity and income of all urban residents, espe-&#13;
cially the poor; the lack of basic sanitation presents a direct and indirect health&#13;
hazard to the affected population; a large percentage of diseases affecting the&#13;
population are water bome and are transmitted through contact with contamined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
water, a direct result of poor existing sanitation; for example, there were more&#13;
than 15,000 cases of diarrhea, dysentery, and intestinal infections im the region of&#13;
Mopti in 1994, and 100 cholera deaths in 1995; this situation continued in 1996,&#13;
with over 70 deaths reported in the first half of the year;&#13;
(e)    The drainage works would also generate economic benefits in the form of less&#13;
damage to property, reduce loss of industrial and commercial tumover, lower loss&#13;
in stocks of goods, and prevent damage to infrastructure; and&#13;
(f)    The historic cities component in Timbuktu (IDA-financed) has two parts: create&#13;
an architecture and masonry workshop to train around 150 masons in the local and&#13;
traditional methods of building construction and restoration, and improve the land-&#13;
scape around the three major mosques of Timbuktu dating back to the 15'" cen-&#13;
tury. These mosques, which are a major tourism attraction, have been maintained&#13;
by the inhabitants through yearly addition of banco, a local earthen plaster; how-&#13;
ever, in the past few years a lack of resources has led to increasing neglect; due to&#13;
the political conditions in Northern Mali, maintenance and restoration of the&#13;
mosques were neglected and there has been a gradual loss of skills. The workshop&#13;
will train students and masons in the maintenance and restoration of the mosques&#13;
as well as other buildings within and outside Timbuktu. The landscaping around&#13;
the mosques is necessary to prevent the steady degradation of the mosque walls&#13;
caused by constant contact with wastewater from adjacent households, as well as&#13;
to improve pedestrian and vehicle traffic in the adjacent streets and create a more&#13;
open area around the mosques to welcome visitors and tourists and attract foreign&#13;
revenues. The potential foreign exchange revenue was estimated at US$10.00&#13;
million net a year for th., vhole of tllc Djenne-Mopti-Bandiagara-Timbuktu area,&#13;
the most touristic region in Mall.&#13;
C. IMACr ON EMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY&#13;
4.4    The project targets the poorest neighborhoods in Bamako where 50% of the population live&#13;
below the poverty line, and the regonal capital cities, especially in the North where 75% of the&#13;
population are below the poverty line. The project's water supply and sanitation subcomponents&#13;
will benefit the poor, the women, and children who are without access to clean, affordable water&#13;
and waste-disposal facilities, mainly in Bamako and Mopti. The urban infrastructure improvement&#13;
and market programs provide basic infrastructure services that will improve the living conditions&#13;
of the urban poor. Furthermore, the use of labor-intensive works subprojects will create around&#13;
200,000 person-months of direct jobs (or 4,000 permanent jobs for five years), of which 70% are&#13;
for unskilled workers. As demonstrated in a survey conducted during the mid-term review of the&#13;
ongoing PWCBP, about 400,000 person-montli. i,direct jobs would be created. The use of new&#13;
management tools will help the municipalities better prioritize their investment and target poor ar-&#13;
eas.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMACT&#13;
4.5    The proposed project is classified as Category B. It is expected to have a significant posi-&#13;
tive impacts on the environment through improvements in water supply and sanitation, drainage&#13;
and flood control, sanitation in the industrial area of Bamako to protect the Niger river, and solid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
waste management. The environmental assessment was preceded by an audit of the impacts from&#13;
the First and Second Urban Projects, which indicated that the previous projects greatly contributed&#13;
to improving the environment in Bamako.&#13;
4.6    The main environmental impacts identified include:  (a) pressure on groundwater re-&#13;
sources, due to the increased use of wells by the population; (b) disruption of natural water flows&#13;
in small watersheds due to the construction of roads; (c) health effects from unsafe water supply&#13;
from shallow wells in three Bamako neighborhoods; (d) risks of water pollution caused by the&#13;
proximity of technical and sanitary usages of water in the marketplaces and transport stations, and&#13;
pollution from motors used oils. The project will integrate actions on public health and urban envi-&#13;
ronmental management through: (i) improving environmental components such as water supply in&#13;
Bamako and Mopti-Sevare, the pilot sanim.:tion plan in Mopti-Sevare, and the masterplan for solid&#13;
waste in Bamako; (ii) implementing awareness programs on the urban environment at national and&#13;
local levels (municipalities and communities), and developing a sanitation strategy for Bamako;&#13;
(iii) mitigating environmental impacts of sub-components (roads, marketplaces, and transportation&#13;
terminals), as needed, with special attention to urban aspects.&#13;
4.7    The environmental management plan includes five types of mitigation measures, which are&#13;
detailed in Annex 11. They include: (a) specific mitigation measures for subprojects, to be further&#13;
detailed in their executive studies; (b) additional investment in environmental actions, including&#13;
drainage, landscaping, the protection of outfall areas of drainage channels in the Niger river;&#13;
(c) environmental awareness and capacity building at all levels (specially at the community level)&#13;
and training of trainers; (d) regulatory measures to control the drilling and use of wells, and the&#13;
creation of coordinating bodies at Mopti and Bamako, involving the government, communities,&#13;
and providers and users of environmental services; and (e) a monitoring plan, including environ-&#13;
mental and health indicators.&#13;
E. CAPACIry BULDING&#13;
4.8    The project would develop the capacity of the local governments in the following areas:&#13;
urban management, investment programming and contracting, fee collection, and urban infrastruc-&#13;
ture maintenance. The project would also extend the development program for construction con-&#13;
tractors and consultants started under the PWCBP to the regions. It would open new opportunities&#13;
for small- and medium-scale enterprises in the secondary cities to undertake public works and&#13;
services, such as management of marketplaces and transport stations. It would also strengthen the&#13;
technical capacities of the firms already involved in the AGETIPE project. It would develop the&#13;
skills of local consultants. It would reinforce the capacity of Malian masons for restoration of&#13;
historic monuments and houses.&#13;
F. RISKS AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.9    The principal project risks stem from the possibility that the Central Government may be&#13;
unable to implement the urban policy reform and decentralization, or to remove obstacles to the&#13;
mobilization and allocation of adequate financial resources for the municipalities. The risks stem&#13;
also from the inability of local governments to increase their revenue base and tax collection and&#13;
mobilize adequate financial resources for infrastructure maintenance and counterpart funding.&#13;
These risks are mitigated by the strong sense of ownership demonstrated by the Central and local&#13;
governments during project preparation, the planned close monitoring of performance indicators of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the municipalities and the public investment programs, and prolonged and close coordination with&#13;
other donors. They are also mitigated by: (i) the implementation of the Economic Management&#13;
Operation which plans a program of fiscal reforms to increase domestic resource mobilization;&#13;
(ii) the instruments set up by the project to improve resource mobilization (fiscal mapping, new tax&#13;
or fee on urban occupancy, and privatization of marketplace management); (iii) the institutional&#13;
support to local governments; and (iv) on the counterpart side, the annual programs of civil works&#13;
to be financed by the project will be a function of the funds mobilized and spent by the local (or&#13;
Central) governments for urban infrastructure maintenance.&#13;
4.10   For the water supply component, the main risks are: (i) the failure of EDM to implement&#13;
the installation and operation of the water supply network; however, the ongoing investments to&#13;
increase water treatment capacity, financed by a credit of FF50.00 million from the CFD, and to&#13;
rehabilitate the Selingue dam financed by IDA, demonstrated that EDM has the capacity to suc-&#13;
cessfully implement large physical works; (ii) water consumption would be lower than expected&#13;
due to economic conditions or low demand for service connections; this risk would be mitigated by&#13;
introducing an extension social connection program; (iii) another risk is that a significant percent-&#13;
age of customers could refuse to pay their bills; this risk is mitigated by the fact that EDM com-&#13;
mercial service, its billing and collection division, is currently implementing a system to detect non-&#13;
payments in a timely manner and institute a service shut-off within a short period of time, reducing&#13;
the losses; (iv) an uncontrolled expansion of inadequate water operations in secondary towns could&#13;
jeopardize EDM's financial viability; this risk could be mitigated by a systematic review of EDM's&#13;
investment plan by IDA; and (v) a final risk is that the long-term financial viability of EDM could&#13;
be threatened by its inability to raise tariffs to cover expenses and to keep up with inflation. This&#13;
risk is minimized by the commitment of the Government to allow EDM to raise its water tariffs to&#13;
cover operating costs and generate a reasonable return on investment. Continuing coordination&#13;
with other donors is necessary to mitigate -11 the abov"-meritioned risks.&#13;
4.11   For the land development component, the main risk stems from the fact that ACI would not&#13;
be able to find land to be developed or to be entrusted with the land development operations. The&#13;
commitment of the Government and the 750 ha of land (foi 15,000 plots; the 5,000 IDA-financed&#13;
plots being the first program) entrusted to ACI before negotiations mitigate this risk. The second&#13;
risk is that this land could be occupied by squatters. This risk is minirnized by the strong Govem-&#13;
ment authority demonstrated in land management in the recent years.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
URBAN SECTOR POLICY LETTER&#13;
LETTRE DE POLIT7QUE SECTORIELLE URBAINE&#13;
Approved by the Government of Mali on Wednesday, September 25, 1996&#13;
1.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    This statement of Mali's urban development sector policy constitutes the framework for the sector's&#13;
programs and projects and is intended to coordinate the activities of all potential stakeholders (central and&#13;
local governments, private sector, civil society, partners in development).&#13;
2.    Mali's history teaches that prior to the modern era, the network of human settlements (including&#13;
hamlets, towns and cities) was marked by vigorous trade on the banks of its two great rivers, the Niger and&#13;
the Senegal, and in the trans-Saharan areas, which has made such a large contribution to opening the&#13;
country up to broader horizons.&#13;
3 .    The prosperity of the different empires and kingdoms in our country (the Mali Empire, the Songhai&#13;
Empire, the Peuhl Kingdom of Macina, the Bambara Kingdom of Segou, the Kenedougou Kingdon, etc.)&#13;
was largely based on a network of urban centers, in which cities such as Timbuktu, Gao, Djenne, Segou&#13;
and Sikasso have each played an important role.&#13;
4.     The colonial penetration starting in 1850 led to disturbances in the political and economic&#13;
organization of the region, particularly since it promoted the growth of coastal cities to the detriment of&#13;
those located inland.&#13;
5.    Notwithstanding, urban development continued in Mali, and intensified with the country's new&#13;
administrative and economic organization in the wake of Indeperdence in 1960.&#13;
6.    However it was only in 1981 that Mali adopted its first urban development instrument called&#13;
"Main Guidelines for National Urban Development and Housing Policy in the Framework of Land Use&#13;
Planning".&#13;
7.    This policy has made it possible to create a momentum for urban managenent marked by:&#13;
i.    greater sensitivity to the phenomenon of urbanization; and&#13;
ii.   the adjustment of urban planning tools, abandoning the "compartmentalized" approach that&#13;
had prevailed until then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 21&#13;
However current and forecast political and socioeconomic realities call for new approaches based on the&#13;
lessons leamed.&#13;
8.     Addressing the issue of urbanization in Mali is a formidable challenge today, owing to the size of&#13;
the human, material, and financial resources that will have to be mobilized and, above all, to the need to&#13;
persevere steadfastly in these efforts. This is the prerequisite for achieving effective and lasting results.&#13;
9.     Mali in the year 2000 will still be a long way from the socioeconomic turning point where the&#13;
urban population becomes the majority, but current national trends are clear enough to demand greater&#13;
attention to control over town and country relations. Better inter-sector coordination of govemment action&#13;
will make it possible to cope better with the situation and to consolidate the results already obtained.&#13;
10.   The choice, then, is an urban development policy built on opportunities in an integrated and&#13;
controlled process based on appropriate actions, given the basic constraints.&#13;
2.   GENERAL PROFILE OF URBAN GROWTEH&#13;
11.   Mali is one of the largest countnres im Africa south of the Sahara, with an area of some 1,241,230&#13;
kIn, close to 7,000 km of borders, and seven neighboring countries.&#13;
12.   It is currently subdivided into eight administrative regions (Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, S6gou,&#13;
Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal, and the district of Bamako).&#13;
13.    Out of a total population of about 9 million, close to 2.4 million live in urban areas, and the urban&#13;
population is growing quickly. For example Bamako, the capital, which had a population of just 320,000&#13;
in 1972, has seen its population triple in two decades, reaching a figure of close to 1 million today. Three&#13;
smaller cities (Segou, Mopti and Sikasso) will soon cross the 100,000 threshold and two others (Gao and&#13;
Kayes) will break the 50,000 mark. The other towns will have under 40,000 residents.&#13;
14.   From Independence to the present, the government's political detennination to decentralize has led&#13;
to the creation of at least 20 local jurisdictions, i.e.:&#13;
i.     19 urban communities each administered by an elected municipal council;&#13;
ii.    the district of Bamako, consisting of six of the urban communities mentioned above, with&#13;
mixed status: the same administrate status as the other eight regions, as well as local&#13;
government.&#13;
15.   The decentralization policy recently introduced in the country favors its reorganization into new&#13;
groupings, i.e. "regions" and "circles" (the current regions and circles are simply administrative districts),&#13;
and the urban and rural communities.  The conditions for independent administration of these new&#13;
decentralized entities have already been laid down in Law 93-008 of February 11, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31                                Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 21&#13;
16.   While the process of decentralization is still being worked on, there are major constraints on&#13;
current urban development with respect to:&#13;
i.    land tenure legislation;&#13;
ii.    supply and demand for building lots;&#13;
iii.   access to decent inexpensive housing;&#13;
iv.    the supply and quality of urban services;&#13;
v.     municipal finances.&#13;
17.   Land tenure legislation is govemed by Law 86-91/AN-RM of August 1, 1986 (the Code Domaniel&#13;
et Foncier). Under this Code, the government is virtually the only owner of the land, with property titles&#13;
held by local governments and private parties accounting for less than 2% of the total. Property rights,&#13;
particularly from the standpoint of urban development, are "provisional" (letter of assignment, occupancy&#13;
permits, etc.) while the purchase of new land for different uses is subject to lengthy and onerous&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Since the events of March 1991, criticisms have been made of the Code, particularly by the holders of&#13;
customary rights and local governments. A national seminar was held in November 1994 which&#13;
recommended that the Land Tenure Code be revised, which is now being done.&#13;
18.   Today, in order to develop an urban property, land or real estate developers are required to obtain&#13;
from the govemment:&#13;
i.    the assignment or surrender of the necessary land;&#13;
ii.    approval of building plans.&#13;
The govemment services in charge of land management, topography, urban development, and construction&#13;
are generally all involved. In practice, the administration's overall efficiency in responding to developers is&#13;
poor and it takes a great deal of time to obtain a decision, particularly because of lack of coordination&#13;
among the services.&#13;
This partially explains the scant supply of building lots when compared to demand. Although lots&#13;
established by the government (the chief developer) were sold at relatively affordable prices, real estate&#13;
speculation has grown up over the years and, with it, unauthorized building, particularly in Bamako where&#13;
the pressure is strongest. The need to combat speculation, difficulties in recovering development costs, and&#13;
the need for greater transparency in allocating the lots that have been established, led in 1992 to the&#13;
establishment of the Agence de Cessions Immobilieres (AC1) [Land Auctioning Agency].&#13;
A special program to rehabilitate unauthorized settlements, called "Save our Neighborhood" has been in&#13;
operation in Bamako since 1993, as an initiative of the district council to:&#13;
i.    provide ownership security (by regularizing land tenancy rights);&#13;
ii.    improve the standard of living in outlying urban areas and control unauthorized building.&#13;
19.   In the process of building housing, self-construction continues to be the rule for two main reasons:&#13;
i.    the housing provided by real estate developers (both public and private) is scarce and too&#13;
expensive for most people;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 21&#13;
ii.    the construction of unauthorized housing has become part of working-class strategy to&#13;
escape the constraints of a rental housing sector that is badly organized and not well&#13;
regulated. Tenants' rights are very poorly protected despite some regulations in the sector:&#13;
(a) Decree 130/PG-RM of August 29, 1967, which sets ceilings on rents for existing&#13;
buildings; (b) Decree 146 of September 27, 1967, which regulates housing rentals in the&#13;
Republic of Mali; and (c) Inter-Ministerial Order 95-0833/MFC-MUH of April 27, 1995,&#13;
which defines the conditions under which Articles 92 and 93 of the General Tax Code will&#13;
be applied.&#13;
But self-construction, as it operates today, is marked by:&#13;
i.     a boom in unauthorized construction: no building permits, and, particularly, unauthorized&#13;
occupation of land belonging to the central and local governments;&#13;
ii.    excessive construction time, principally because families lack funds and, since they are not&#13;
eligible for bank loans and there are no other suitable financing mechanisms, they are&#13;
forced to build at the same pace as their savings capacity;&#13;
iii.    use of unsuitable technologies which result in major wastage of construction materials;&#13;
good building practices are not codified or are not known by masons and other workers&#13;
who are the main agents in self-constnictioin,&#13;
iv.    environmental problems, which are often serious, caused by poor quality urban services&#13;
which are linked to inadequate infrastructure and facilities, and are very unevenly&#13;
distributed in urban spaces.&#13;
20.    The standard of living in urban environments depends essentially on the availability, proximity and&#13;
quality of services, which demands higher investments in infrastructure and basic community facilities.&#13;
In recent years, investments of this kind have grown considerably in Bamako and in all the regional&#13;
capitals, particularly with the establishment of the Agence d'Execution des Travaux d'Interet Public pour&#13;
l'Emploi (AGETIPE) [Public Works Executing Agency], which as a delegated contract manager, has&#13;
considerably improved the efficiency with which resources are used.&#13;
Despite this growth in investments, some serious problems must still be addressed if sustainable urban&#13;
development is to be achieved. They include:&#13;
i.    insufficient or no maintenance of existing infrastructure and facilities to capitalize on the&#13;
investments already made;&#13;
ii.    weakness in municipal management capacity;&#13;
iii.   lack of control over municipal financing, marked by inability to recover the costs of urban&#13;
services;&#13;
iv.    scant participation by the private sector in managing facilities and in constructing basic&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33                                Annex 1&#13;
Page 5 of 21&#13;
21.   As the result of uncontrolled growth and the twofold increase in the ACrVs developments, housing&#13;
in Bamako has spread rapidly on the right bank of the river Niger and in the Sevare and Medina-Coura&#13;
zones (community of Mopti-Sevare), creating an urgent need for drinking water which the two&#13;
municipalities are unable to provide unaided, given their current financial straits.&#13;
22.   The serious environmental problems that are being encountered more frequently in Malian cities&#13;
are partly the result of the new forms of urban management that make the government the main player in&#13;
public sanitation and safety. This situation is a major setback in view of Mali's urban tradition that&#13;
demanded that individuals take responsibility in exercising public obligations.&#13;
23.   The wealth of Mali's monuments, artifacts, and non-material heritage has nourished the history and&#13;
lore of the African continent, in both the Arab and Westem worlds. Protection of this heritage was an&#13;
unwritten rule, consecrated by tradition.&#13;
Under written regulations to safeguard this heritage, the law has required civil society to participate&#13;
alongside decentralized government agencies (Law 85-40/AN-RM of July 26, 1985, on the protection and&#13;
promotion of the national cultural heritage).&#13;
Consequently, the local communities have taken responsibility and actions to safeguard their cultural&#13;
resources through the establishment of local committees to protect the cultural heritage, under the following&#13;
instruments:&#13;
i.    Order 003/MSAC/DNAC of January 3, 1989, establishing regional and local cultural&#13;
heritage committees;&#13;
ii.    Decree 89-428/P-RM of December 28, 1989, placing the cultural and natural sanctuary of&#13;
the Bandiagara Cliffs on the list of heritage sites;&#13;
iii.    Decree 92-245/P-RM of December 18, 1992, placing the old cities of Timbuktu and&#13;
Djenne on the list of heritage sites;&#13;
iv.    Decree 93-208/P-RM of June 11, 1993, establishing Cultural Missions in Timbuktu,&#13;
Djenn6 and Bandiagara.&#13;
With respect to the world heritage, Dejenn6 and Timbuktu were registered under numbers 212 and 213 at&#13;
the 12th session of the World Heritage Committee on December 9, 1988, and the Cliffs of Bandiagara&#13;
under number 320 at the 13th session on December 15, 1989.&#13;
The extent of the task to safeguard and promote the cultural heritage is a formidable challenge. While the&#13;
non-material heritage and cultural identity is threatened by the globalization of communications, the&#13;
monuments are threatened by time, weather and pillaging.&#13;
It is now recognized that sustainable human development is grounded in the realities and cultural&#13;
experience of the habitat. Safeguarding the cultural heritage is therefore an action to preserve the internal&#13;
development dynamics of a nation: originality, plurality, and humanity are the basis for harmony and the&#13;
wellspring of development of this kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                               Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 21&#13;
24.   Decentralization will be an important opportunity to rectify the situation and special attention&#13;
should be paid to the effective expression of all cultural values that have contributed to Mali's well-being&#13;
over the ages and which can continue to contribute to more harmonious urban development in the country.&#13;
25.   However there are major constraints on the dynamics of urban management today which could&#13;
jeopardize sustainable urban development, particularly:&#13;
i.    poorly defined town and country relationships which are managed with no thought to the&#13;
strengths and weaknesses of the different poles of development and therefore have no&#13;
possibility of being guided by mutual enrichment;&#13;
ii.    high population growth in the cities, in a context of scant land allocation and housing&#13;
production, which very often lies at the heart of the current explosion of unauthorized&#13;
building and cities that continue to sprawl unchecked;&#13;
iii.   insufficient and poorly distributed urban services which often suffer from serious problems&#13;
of accessibility (physical and economic) and quality;&#13;
iv.   insufficient financial resources with poorly-allocated spending (too much on personnel and&#13;
too little on municipal services);&#13;
v.    an institutional environment that is out of step, particularly with current decentralization&#13;
requirements;&#13;
vi.    a cultural heritage threatened with degradation, with consequences that jeopardize&#13;
harmonious human development.&#13;
3.    OBJECTIVES AND  STRATEGIES OF THE  URBAN  DEVELOPMENT  SECTOR&#13;
POLICY&#13;
26.   The general objective of the urban development sector policy is to lay the groundwork for&#13;
improving living conditions, particularly the struggle against urban poverty, in the general context of&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
27.   The specific objectives are to:&#13;
i.    set the stage for better control over urban growth;&#13;
ii.    help to improve living conditions in cities by stepping up the fight against urban poverty;&#13;
iii.   promote the national cultural heritage as a vehicle for more harmonious urban&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35                               Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 21&#13;
3.1    OBJECTIVE 1. BETTER CONTROL OVER URBAN GROWT:H&#13;
28.   The main guidelines of the national urban development policy in the area of land management have&#13;
provided an opportunity for defining and applying in Mali:&#13;
i.    urban regulations that form the urban development master plan and the urban development&#13;
sector plan;&#13;
ii.    operational urban development tools, with the main ones being land subdivision,&#13;
rehabilitation, restructuring and urban renewal.&#13;
Despite the noble goals pursued in those regulations, their impact is very weak on urban development in&#13;
general, mainly because there are not enough urban development instruments, and few operations are&#13;
actually carried out in comparison with the enormous needs, which are continually mounting.&#13;
29.   Thus, in point of fact, cities are developing unofficially, in a horizontal fashion that reduces the&#13;
capacity for public investments in community infrastructure and facilities and the quality of basic urban&#13;
services.&#13;
Cities are managed as independent units, with no organized structural relationship with their surrounding&#13;
rural environment or with the country's other urban centers.&#13;
30.   In short, urban development has virtually been left to the government alone. Communities and civil&#13;
society exercise very little direct responsibility, which lessens the chances of laying the foundation for&#13;
sustainable urban development.&#13;
Stratet 1. Entrenchment of the decentralization process&#13;
31.   The National Conference held in the wake of the political events in 1991 determined that&#13;
decentralization would be one of the core elements in the new democratic process.&#13;
Clearly, decentralization is the best opportunity for achieving true local democracy, which is a basic&#13;
condition for responding better to public demands, since it involve citizens and makes them more&#13;
responsible for the management of business that concems them, through their elected representatives on the&#13;
community level.&#13;
Following this approach to development, the 1995-1997 Action Plan of the Ministry of Urban Development&#13;
and Housing has been crafted around decentralization, in the strong conviction that urban development can&#13;
only have a sustainable impact:&#13;
i.    in a comprehensive approach that includes increasingly larger spaces;&#13;
ii.   in a participative context in which all the urban stakeholders are involved, with the&#13;
municipalities fostering and coordinating local initiatives, which are the key factor in&#13;
change;&#13;
iii.    with a revised Land Tenure Code that will help to strengthen decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                Annex 1&#13;
Page 8 of 21&#13;
32.   Major steps have already been taken in this direction, and others are under way, including:&#13;
i.    the laws and decrees already in effect or in the process of being approved, i.e.: (a) Law&#13;
93-008 of February 11, 1993, which determine the conditions for independent local&#13;
administration; (b) Law 95-022 of March 20, 1995, on the functions of local goveniment&#13;
employees; (c) Law 95-034 of April 12, 1995, on the Municipal Code of the Republic of&#13;
Mali; (d) Decree 95-210 of May 30, 1995, which determines the electoral qualifications&#13;
and powers of local representatives; (e) Law 96-025 of February 21, 1996, on the special&#13;
status of the District of Bamako; (f) Decree 96-119/P-RM of April 11, 1996, which&#13;
determines the electoral qualifications and powers of the representatives of the District of&#13;
Bamako; (f) Decree 96-084/P-RM of March 20, 1996, which determines the terms and&#13;
conditions under which decentralized government services will be made available to the&#13;
municipalities; and (h) law on the principles of the structure and management of local&#13;
governments;&#13;
ii.   the national and regional land management plans (draft already available) which, as frames&#13;
of reference and consistency, are the instruments for dialogue between the central and local&#13;
government and the other stakeholders in development to translate the exercise in renewal&#13;
of the system for planning, programming and managing development into reality;&#13;
iii.   zoning to negotiate the establishment of certain new communities (rural and urban)&#13;
according to the wishes of the people, which will be self managing in the different&#13;
geographic and socioeconomic spaces that will be created;&#13;
iv.    revision of the Land Tenure Code to give the public and the communities greater&#13;
responsibility for managing their land resources.&#13;
33.    The decentralization process thus launched is continuing to be entrenched under the momentum of&#13;
the decentralization mission, with the main goal of building a more dynamic partnership between the central&#13;
and local governments, the private sector and civil society in order to strengthen democracy in Mali.&#13;
Strateat 2. Development of a network of secondary cities&#13;
The future plans (national and regional levels) for development will provide an opportunity for building up&#13;
the regional subsystems, in a mutual alliance that will favor the emergence of support points (large&#13;
population clusters or urban centers) to create a genuine process of settlement-development.&#13;
It is this phenomenon of concentration that highlights the modem city; it is the consequence of development&#13;
in general and urban development in particular. Cities are not only potential markets for farm products,&#13;
but are also the vanguard for scientific and technological progress that supports urban and rural activities&#13;
alike.&#13;
Aware that urban development efforts have focused exclusively on the city of Bamako since Independence,&#13;
the government is now opting for a planned policy to build up the secondary cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37                                  Annex 1&#13;
Page 9 of 21&#13;
35.    To support this development it will be necessary to:&#13;
a.     Prepare and implement national and regional development plans in a way that will provide future&#13;
urban and rural communities with suitable tools for controlling their resources and designing their&#13;
different development programs.&#13;
b.     Develop a secondary urban network (mainly cities of over 10,000) with the necessary linkage:&#13;
i.     upstream, to the capital Bamako, which is the nerve center of the country's political and&#13;
socioeconomic system and is home today to at least 50% of the total urban population;&#13;
ii.    downstream, to the rural production zones that are the mainstays of national wealth.&#13;
c.     Make specific efforts to improve the road links between cities and to build and maintain rural roads&#13;
to improve access to urban markets and services.&#13;
Strategy 3. Better urban management&#13;
36.   In the current stage of the development of Mali's cities, urban planning must be strengthened and&#13;
redirected in order to enhance coordination between public and private action in building community&#13;
infrastructure and facilities, in developing extension areas and in their operation, with a view to delivering&#13;
higher quality services.&#13;
The strategy is mainly intended to ensure:&#13;
i.     consensus on the establishment of facilities and services, particularly by protecting the&#13;
rights-of-way necessary to build systems;&#13;
ii.    equitable distribution of services in the urban space, thus improving accessibility in&#13;
outlying areas, which are generally the most needy;&#13;
iii.   facilitation of urban activities by promoting transportation services inside cities;&#13;
iv.    better environmental protection.&#13;
Under the decentralization initiative, the communities have full control over land tenure in their localities,&#13;
with the possibility of obtaining their own asset base and designing a policy for the establishment and&#13;
management of urban facilities.&#13;
37.    However with regard to the tools currently in use it should be noted that:&#13;
i.     existing urban development instruments are largely out of step with decentralization and&#13;
land tenure activities, which translates into protracted periods for the preparation and&#13;
approval of projects (5 to 7 years), since the situation on the ground is evolving more&#13;
quickly every day;&#13;
ii.    investment choices are often overly rigid in light of objective needs which are changng&#13;
rapidly;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                Annex I&#13;
Page 10 of 21&#13;
iii.   neither local governments nor the general public have sufficient ownership of those tools.&#13;
38.   Urban planning will be improved as a consequence of the following:&#13;
a.     The simplification of tools, through the updating of instruments such as the Urban Development&#13;
Code, the Practical Guide to Urban Management, the Practical Guide to Land Management, and&#13;
the Urban Development Reference Plan, by:&#13;
i.    facilitating the establishment of urban data bases, with particular attention to the main&#13;
urban and housing indicators;&#13;
ii.    helping to prepare multi-annual investment and maintenance programs for community&#13;
infrastructure and facilities and to promote land management;&#13;
iii.   tracking progress in cities over time and helping to prepare short and medium-term&#13;
development strategies.&#13;
b.     De facto control over the most important or most vulnerable land reserves (since the planning&#13;
document is limited to "structuring" the urban space.), with particular stress on the layout of&#13;
primary and possible secondary networxs and the location of said reserves.&#13;
c.     Agreement between the decision makers and all the local stakeholders in identifying priority actions&#13;
in a truly dynamic partnership.&#13;
39.    The success of the program will depend on bolstering skalls through training in the use of civic&#13;
management tools (for mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants), elected representatives,&#13;
administrators, and citizens.&#13;
3.2    OBJECTIVE 2. IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONS IN CITIES&#13;
40.    Sustainable urban development cannot be obtained without meeting the essential needs of the&#13;
public, particularly the poorest groups. Cities are, in particular, the places where conflicts of interests arise&#13;
and where there is a continuing need for negotiation and arbitration. The coordinated action of all players&#13;
is necessary to pursue the goal of sustainable development at the service of all individual and collective&#13;
interests.&#13;
Strategv 4. Strengthening the partnership between the central and local governments and the private sector&#13;
41.    The normal functioning of urban activities requires clear rules of the game for the different&#13;
partners, which are chiefly the central and local governnents and private interests. Urban management is&#13;
grouped into the following action priorities, with each level having its own intemal demands:&#13;
a.     Planning and programming, with a strong requirement for consultation with all potential&#13;
stakeholders to reach appropriate decisions regarding:&#13;
i.    investment priorities;&#13;
ii.    ways and means of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39                                 Annex 1&#13;
Page 11 of 21&#13;
b.     Execution, particularly steering, control, and implementation.&#13;
c.     Maintenance, which is indispensable to preserve the investments.&#13;
42.    Programs and projects initiated on the public level fall within the purview of the central or local&#13;
administrations; taking charge of them requires:&#13;
a.     A contractor: ministry, decentralized service or municipality;&#13;
b.    Implementing agencies: increasingly from the private sector; despite the continuing involvement of&#13;
public services, particularly on the design-control level, physical implementation is increasingly in&#13;
the hands of businesses and, in recent years, with strong growth in the role of small and medium-&#13;
sized enterprises and economic interest groups.&#13;
However partnerships of this kind now call for a redefinition of roles and a broader field of&#13;
communications among all urban stakeholders.&#13;
43.    The appearance of delegated contractors (AGETIPE, ACD) on the scene since 1992 and current&#13;
investment practices point particularly to the difficulties that the municipalities encounter in negotiating&#13;
projects, especially owing to the absence of programming (choice of projects, investment priorities,&#13;
allocation of resources, maintenance of works). Specific measures, such as training for local government&#13;
officials (mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants, technical officers, etc.) will be used to&#13;
strengthen their capacity to contract municipal works. The transfers of powers and resources from the&#13;
central government to the local govemments currently under way will pennit these measures to be defined&#13;
more closely.&#13;
44.    The private sector will continue to be supported by facilitating true professionalism, without which&#13;
it will be impossible to provide better quality services at lower cost. In this dynamic, associative and&#13;
participative management of urban development will be supported by organization of the community&#13;
around specific or combined interest groups, to foster the emergence of a civil society that is increasingly in&#13;
charge and aggressive in establishing economic structures such as cooperatives and economic interest&#13;
groups.&#13;
45.    Government administration will be rescaled, based on a specific institutional development program&#13;
to strengthen communities and the private sector.&#13;
Strategy 5. Larzer local receipts and better management of communitv resources&#13;
46.    One of the fundamental conditions for successful decentralization clearly lies in the financial self-&#13;
sufficiency of communities. However at present local governments have few sources of income and no&#13;
potential for the self-financing of investments. This situation is the result of low taxation and insignificant&#13;
income from marketable services, although the potential for resource mobilization is large.&#13;
Therefore instruments have been adopted to increase the income of the local governments (Law 96-21 of&#13;
1996 on fiscal resources for local governments and Law 96 of 1996 on fiscal resources for the District of&#13;
Bamako and its municipalities) under a new strategy for sharing the tax pie between the central and local&#13;
governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                 Annex 1&#13;
Page 12 of 21&#13;
Special stress is now placed on revenue-generating facilities (marketplaces, road transport terminals) and&#13;
privatization of their management to help boost municipal income. Steps will be taken to ensure that the&#13;
municipalities obtain the maximum possible benefits from taxpayer identification with the goal of&#13;
improving efficiency in the collection of fees and taxes.&#13;
47.    In light of the weakness of the central govemment's financial base and the impossibility of making&#13;
massive transfers to the municipalities in the short term, and given the absence of local property taxes in&#13;
their own right and excessive tax concentration on the potentially largest taxpayers, a municipal tax will be&#13;
introduced to benefit urban communities, whose main objective is:&#13;
i.    in the short term, to permit the municipalities to finance the maintenance of community&#13;
works;&#13;
ii.    in the medium and long terms, to help increase urban resources.&#13;
Improvements in municipal financial and accounting management will be obtained beginning in 1997&#13;
through:&#13;
i.     preparation of a guide for community organization and management, once the&#13;
organizational audits underway are completed;&#13;
ii.    introduction of tax registers adapted to each municipality;&#13;
iii.    computerization of municipal accounting services;&#13;
iv.    taxpayer identification;&#13;
v.     establishment of compatible data bases that can evolve in future into a monitoring station&#13;
for local finances to help improve management of municipal potential in relation to own&#13;
efforts, particularly in the framework of national solidarity with regard to local&#13;
government;&#13;
vi.    organization of specific training for municipal personnel and elected officials: financial&#13;
management, mobilization of fiscal resources, etc.;&#13;
vii.   design of performance indicators to help measure growth in the effectiveness of financial&#13;
services such as: (a) mobilization of resources through taxes and commercial activities;&#13;
(b) percentage of capital spending on infrastructure and maintenance; (c) spending-to-&#13;
income ratio; and (d) rate of recovery of investment costs.&#13;
49.    Last, city contracts will be introduced to cover cases in which municipalities require reimbursable&#13;
loans to boost their investment capacity. The contracts will include:&#13;
i.     program estimates for new investments and for the maintenance of existing infrastructure&#13;
and facilities;&#13;
ii.    support services for management and financial resources;&#13;
iii.    criteria for measuring the performance of the municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41                                  Annex I&#13;
Page 13 of 21&#13;
Strategy 6. Strengheninz municipal contract management capacity&#13;
50.    All municipalities are members of the Association des Maires de Mali (AMM) [Association of&#13;
Mayors] which is their voice on the national level. They have all encountered enormious difficulties in fully&#13;
shouldering their new authority and responsibilities under the decentralization process.&#13;
The municipalities are particularly ill-prepared for the tasks of planning, financial programming and&#13;
maintenance. This situation often gives rise to jurisdictional disputes regarding the choice of certain&#13;
investments and in their location in the urban space. Even more dramatic is the premature decay of many&#13;
investments made on behalf of the municipalities owing to the absence of minimum maintenance during&#13;
operation.&#13;
51.    Strategies are necessary to gradually involve the municipalities more closely in investment choices&#13;
and in effective participation in financing and maintenance.&#13;
From this standpoint, particular stress will be placed on:&#13;
i.     advisory assistance for the different local governments;&#13;
ii.    the strengthening of technical capacity to contract local works;&#13;
iii.    adoption of the model city contract to permit the municipalities to more clearly establish&#13;
the objectives of their different urban development activities, thus facilitating negotiation&#13;
of their commitrnents with the different partners in development;&#13;
iv.    training for municipal personnel (mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants,&#13;
technical officers, etc.).&#13;
Strategv 7. Greater efforts to protect and upgrade the urban environment&#13;
52.    The preservation and improvement of the quality of the urban environment is an indispensable&#13;
condition for sustainable urban development. Urban environmental problems urgently calling for solutions&#13;
stem ftom:&#13;
i.    insufficient basic services;&#13;
ii.    poor management of urban waste;&#13;
iii.    difficult access to land for most people.&#13;
The proliferation of unauthorized settlements, the very weak structure of most urban tissues, new and more&#13;
irresponsible environmental behavior, the weakening of the traditional ties of solidarity and mutual&#13;
assistance, are among the main causes and consequences of the environmental imbalance generally found in&#13;
urban centers, whose repercussions are being felt more and more in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                 Annex I&#13;
Page 14 of 21&#13;
53.    The types of activities required to address the situation include:&#13;
i.     greater emphasis on strategies to educate and sensitize the public to urban environmental&#13;
problems to obtain their support and effective mobilization in specific programs and&#13;
projects;&#13;
ii.    better land management policy and preparation of guidelines to improve access to land for&#13;
the vast majority of the urban population, with special attention to vulnerable groups;&#13;
iii.    greater emphasis on associative and participative management of urban waste through the&#13;
establishment of economic structures (cooperatives, economic interest groups, etc.).&#13;
StrategW 8. Specific measures to improve drinking water supplies&#13;
54.    One of the aspects that marks sustainable human development is better public health, and in view&#13;
of the impact of water-borne diseases on primary care, one of the most effective contributions is to make&#13;
more safe water available. The government has adopted a sustained policy to improve the health status of&#13;
Malians, through the provision of drinking water (master plan for water resources including an action&#13;
program for the period 1992-2001 by type of activity: agriculture, livestock production, potable water, and&#13;
implementation of a health, population and rural water project).&#13;
55.    Despite all the government's on-going efforts to produce and deliver drinking water in both urban&#13;
and rural areas, a great deal remains to be done. In Bamako and Mopti, in particular, supply lags far&#13;
behind demand.&#13;
56.   In addition to actions under way in other programs and projects, specific steps are required in the&#13;
short and medium terms in those two cities to attain the following objectives:&#13;
a.     To address the pressing and immediate need for water in the community of Mopti-S6vare and the&#13;
district of Bamako.&#13;
b.     To detect and tap groundwater as an altemative source of water for Bamako and its vicinity in the&#13;
event of heavy pollution of the Niger river.&#13;
c.     To study water supplies for the district of Bamako up to the 2010 horizon and introduce water&#13;
rates that will make for financial balance in the water sector.&#13;
57.    To improve the quality of service, particularly good management and maintenance of installations&#13;
and other investments, the management capacity of the Societe Energie du Mali (EDM) [Mali Energy&#13;
Company], particularly its Water Branch, will be bolstered.&#13;
&#13;

Strateg 9. Development of labor-intensive employment, with stress on the promotion of suitable&#13;
technologies&#13;
58.    Since AGETIPE was established in 1992, labor-intensive jobs have grown rapidly. The impact of&#13;
different interventions in the employment situation is beyond doubt. However, in the field there is a&#13;
growing need to increase local value added.&#13;
These concerns range from the pricing of local construction materials to the maintenance of investments, to&#13;
greater professionalism in consulting firms and among local entrepreneurs, and better management&#13;
(compilation, processing and dissemination) of technological information, ensuring that it is made as widely&#13;
available as possible. This reflects, in short, a significant need to promote alternative technologies geared&#13;
to specific national and regional circumstances.&#13;
59.    Steps in this direction will mainly focus on:&#13;
a.    Pursuit of decentralization in AGETIPE's activities to bring it even closer to the municipalities,&#13;
with the future establishment of other agencies to make for greater effectiveness in management&#13;
and fewer difficulties in coordination.&#13;
b.    Pursuit of technical assistance and on-going training for the private sector, particularly consulting&#13;
services and building and civil engineering companies to improve their organization and&#13;
management performance.&#13;
c.     Strengthening of job creation capacity, especially through the choice of more appropriate&#13;
technologies and special stress on:&#13;
i.     boosting the capacity of consulting services and local entrepreneurs to manage contracting,&#13;
observing the rules of the game, and using locally available materials;&#13;
ii.    producing and distributing practical guidelines for contractors (choice of investment&#13;
opportunities) and workers (implementation technologies);&#13;
iii. encouraging effective production and large-scale use of local materials.&#13;
d.    More transparent market management through increasingly healthy competition among consulting&#13;
services and among entrepreneurs, with continuing demands to improve the quality/cost ratio.&#13;
e.    Expeditious payments to companies and consulting firms.&#13;
3.3  OBJECTIVE 3. MORE HARMONIOUS URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
60.    Since sustainable development is grounded in human realities and cultural experience, the action&#13;
plan of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, approved on July 4, 1995, has made the cultural&#13;
dimension the prerequisite for all sustainable socioeconomic growth, supported particularly by the example&#13;
of different grassroots social entities in the country (communities, extended families) which have known&#13;
down the ages how to shape their course based on patterns fixed in the collective memory through different&#13;
means of expression.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 16 of 21&#13;
Many human groups in Mali are still able to live fully in the present, illuminated by the past, to better&#13;
prepare for the future. However this inheritance is partly threatened today with "degradation" and physical&#13;
disappearance. Specific measures are indispensable to address the situation.&#13;
61.    Many human groups across the country are living with constraints and looking back with nostalgia&#13;
to their still-recent past, which is rich in individual and collective identity values on the local and national&#13;
levels.&#13;
In the decentralization process under way, public debates and statements by local and national authorities&#13;
reflect a strong determination to lift the country's different human settlements out of the cultural anonymity&#13;
into which many have sunk over the years. This would doubtless breath new life into the nation by setting&#13;
the stage for the expression of cultural plurality in unity, based on the exceptional human legacy of the&#13;
Mali of yesterday.&#13;
In particular, this would involve forms of local architecture and expression and appropriate models of&#13;
communication to regain the strength necessary to safeguard and promote the local and national cultural&#13;
heritage.&#13;
62.    From this standpoint, special efforts will be made to open the country up to the outside, fortifying&#13;
the national contibution to universal culture and improving access to the country's different historic sites.&#13;
Strategy 10. Protecting restorin and promoting historic cities and monuments&#13;
63.    The plan of action to protect and promote Mali's historic cities and monurnents prepared by the&#13;
Ministry of Culture presents a strategy to achieve this general objective through effective actions in the&#13;
field, under the control of the government, and vith the active and responsible participation of civil society,&#13;
whose fundamental concerns are the springboards for action.&#13;
64.    To effectively and efficiently implement the different actions in a coherent framework:&#13;
1 .    the central government will provide institutional support, particularly to create a more&#13;
receptive context for these activities;&#13;
ii.    the Cultural Missions will be responsible for coordinating execution of all protection and&#13;
conservation activities on the local level, providing guidelines for the implementation of the&#13;
World Heritage Convention;&#13;
iii.   the Local Heritage Protection Committees will be responsible for organizing the&#13;
comnmunity to participate in the work of restoring, maintaining and operating the cultural&#13;
infrastructure, and for sensitizmg the public to the need to protect archeological sites;&#13;
iv.    the Cultural Associations will assist the entities responsible for protecting the heritage in&#13;
executing the work and in promoting cultural infrastructure such as museums and&#13;
documentation ceiters.&#13;
&#13;

65.   The specific actions involve:&#13;
a.    Promotion and conservation of historic cities and monuments through the establishment of&#13;
protected zones and restoration.&#13;
b.    Establishment of site museums and documentation centers to preserve cultural objects and prevent&#13;
pilfering, theft, and illegal trade.&#13;
c.    Development of traditional skills.&#13;
d.    Appropriate linkage with tourism promotion on the national level.&#13;
66.   Special attention will be paid to the cities and sites classified as part of the world heritage:&#13;
i.    Timbuktu, its three famous 14th century mosques, and its mausoleums and cemeteries&#13;
through: (a) restoration and protection of the mosques; (b) rehabilitation of cemeteries and&#13;
mausoleums; and (c) development of tourist circuits and urban tourism facilities;&#13;
ii.    Dejenn6 and the 2nd century B.C. archeological site of Djenne-Djeno through:&#13;
(a) protection and promotion of the site; (b) construction of the Djenne museum;&#13;
(c) preservation of the typical architecture of the mosque; and (d) sanitation of the city;&#13;
iii.    The Bandiagara Cliffs cultural and natural sanctuary through: (a) rehabilitation of the&#13;

4.  ACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR&#13;
POLICY&#13;
4.1 ACTION PLAN TO CONTROL URBAN GROWTH&#13;
67.   To attain the specific objective of controlling urban growth, the government undertakes to&#13;
implement institutional measures and regulations to:&#13;
a.    Decentralize socioeconomic and cultural activities, enhancing effective participation by local&#13;
governments, particularly through the transfer of authority over the design and control of&#13;
development actions in their localities;&#13;
b.    Develop a network of secondary cities that will serve as links between the capital and the main&#13;
rural production centers;&#13;
c.    Strengthen the management capacity of the cities to prepare and introduce appropriate urban&#13;
management tools that will permit them to take effective control over their development;&#13;
d.    Strengthen the capacity to provide land and promote real estate development with greater&#13;
involvement by the private sector and civil society.&#13;
&#13;

deprived neighborhoods, the government undertakes to:&#13;
a.       Strengthen and develop partnerships among the different stakeholders in urban  development&#13;
(central and local governments, private sector, civil society, partners in development, etc.) for&#13;
better programming of development actions.&#13;
b.      Take steps to improve local revenues and the quality of their management: transfers of funds,&#13;
creation of urban taxes, privatization of the management of commercial facilities, etc.&#13;
c.       Strengthen the techmical capacity to contract community works for better monitoring of the&#13;
execution and maintenance of basic and revenue-generating infrastructure: advisory assistance,&#13;
signature of city contracts, training for elected representatives and municipal officers, etc.&#13;
d.      Work to improve the urban environment, through better sewage treatment and domestic waste&#13;
disposal, and combat of industrial pollution: support for strategies to educate and sensitize the&#13;

REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
1.     Miethodology&#13;
Evaluation criteria for the various subprojects of the Mali UDDP are based mainly on the net&#13;
benefit stream for the econonic analysis and on the corresponding net revenues for the financial analysis.&#13;
Economic intemal rates of return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) are included as indicators. The&#13;
discount rate for calculation of NPV is 12%, the current standard rate which reflects the opportuity cost&#13;
of capital. All costs and benefits are expressed in 1996 prices, and were actualized and compared over a&#13;
period of 20 years (30 years for water supply). Investmert expenditures as well as revenues from fees or&#13;
tariffs are presented net of duties and taxes. ERR's do not include indirect costs such as interest,&#13;
depreciation and debt service. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken and is individualized for each of the&#13;
subprojects included in this analysis. To ensure simplicity, consistency and transparency, no shadow&#13;
pricing was used. The ddteunination of revenue and benefits vary considerably according to the&#13;
dharacter of the sector concemed; therefore, the indicators retained are described inmividually for each of&#13;
the specific sub-programs. Evaluation tables for each sector and per town are in the Project Files.&#13;
2.     Mumcipal M _intenance Subcomponent&#13;
The District of Bamako and eight regional capitals will be participating in the projected UDDP&#13;
investments, (roads and drainage, markets and transport stations, sanitation). An estimated 1.5 million&#13;
inhabitants in these cities will benefit from the works plarnned. Upon completion of the investments, the&#13;
respective local governments will be responsible for operation of revenue-generating projects and&#13;
maintenance of the physical works. At present, however, the financial situation of Malian local&#13;
governments is precarious; 1994 municipal accounts were in deficit in all but one of the cities (Mopti-&#13;
Sevar6 registered a positive balance). To ensure that local governments benefit fully from the potential&#13;
impact of the UDDP, a series of accompanying measures will seek to reinforce and improve local&#13;
management and revenue collection capacity. These measures include the creation of a new resource&#13;
(urban tax), improvement in the collection of existing resources (patente, market and transport fees), and&#13;
renovation of the management of revenue-Senerating eqjuipment. The creation of the urban tax would&#13;
enable local governments to mobilize their financial contribution for maintenance of road, drainage and&#13;
public lighting works financed by the project (5 to 15% of current revenues). The forecast of urban&#13;
contribution (tax) revenues is based on the estimated nunber of occupied houses in each city, with an&#13;
average tax rate per house of CFAF 2,000-5,000 per year.&#13;
Overall, the project would register a positive impact on municipal finances. Total new revenues&#13;
would amnount to 7.6 billion current CFAF (5.3 billion constant CFAF), with 65% generated in the&#13;
District of Bamako (Table 10.1). Net revenues through 2005 (revenues minus expenditures, resulting&#13;
direcdy from the project), would reach 2.7 billion current CF.F (1.9 billion constant CFAF), with 63%&#13;
in the District of Bamako and the remaining in the other beneficiary cities. The net result represents 36%&#13;
of total municipal revenues from the project. Overall, additional costs generated by the municipal&#13;
subprojects (municipal contribution for maintenance; debt payments for CFD- or KFW-financed&#13;
markets and transport terminals; improvernent of municipal managnent operations) would be largely&#13;
balanced by this new municipal income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.     Urban Road Subprojects&#13;
The urban road rehabilitation and construction subcomponent includes rehabilitation of existing&#13;
roads, construction of new roads, drains, bridges, traffic signals and road signs to improve traffic flow.&#13;
Cities induded for IDA finanang of this subcomnponent are the Distnct of Bamako, Segou, Sikasso,&#13;
Mopti-Sevare, Gao and Kayes. In the Distnct of Barnako, an estimated 17.5 kmn of paved roads will be&#13;
constructed and 10.3 km of road rehabilitated.&#13;
Evaluation cntena. For the District of Bamako, road works proposed in this project will lead to an&#13;
improvemnent of traffic conditions. Two main types of benefits can be identified: (1) increase of&#13;
transport speed, due to improved road conditions, leading to a reduction of transport time as well as a&#13;
decrease in vehicle unit operating costs (UOC); (2) other benefits which result from better roadway&#13;
surfaces, leading to lower car maintenance and repair costs, less wearing out of tires, etc... In Bamako,&#13;
extensive studies of traffic flows, unit costs of vehicle operation and time cost for vehide passengers&#13;
were prepared. The results of these studies, as well as network maps identifyng key links and&#13;
deficiencies and the impact of the priority projects are contained in the Project File.&#13;
Results. The applied rate for annual O&amp;M costs of road and related infrastructure is 5% of the&#13;
investment amount. The ERR results indicate a 91% rate of rehun for road rehabilitation and 67% for&#13;
new road construction. The net present values are 1.7 and 7.9 billion CFAF, respectively. Sensitivity&#13;
analysis was conducted, by modifying total costs (investment and O&amp;M - + 20%) and the benefits&#13;
hypothesis (20% increase of UOC, no time gain benefit). The results of the sensitivity analysis result in&#13;
ERR ranges of 73 to 85% for road rehabilitation and 41 to 58% for road construction (Table 10.2).&#13;
Specific detailed traffic counts and vehicle operatng costs were not available for the regional&#13;
capital cities. The investmnent subprojects will be selected on the basis of their importance to complete&#13;
and better integrate the local road network, C improve Ua&amp;ffic flows, to reduce flooding and to provide&#13;
better access to residential communities or to neighborhoods with econonic activities. When specific&#13;
works are prepared by AGET1PE, orly those subprojects vith an ERR of at least 12% will be&#13;
inVpleneited.&#13;
4. Samtation Subcomponent&#13;
The sanitation comnponent consists of the construction of wells and gutters to collect wastewater&#13;
and prevent contamination of groundwater, and a grassroots campaign to educate the public on sanitary&#13;
and health measures. Total investments costs for sanitaton are CFAF 3.05 billion, with 1.5 billion in&#13;
Mopti, 650 million in Bamako (including studies for the industrial zone sanitation), 500 nillion in&#13;
Timbuktu (istoric cities component) and 400 million in Djenme. This componnet will improve the&#13;
general health of the population in Mopti-Sevare, Djenne, and Timbuktu by providing access to basic&#13;
sanitation, providing for the proper disposal of sewage and waste waters, and increasing awareness of&#13;
sanitary measures to avoid contaminabon. A large number of cases of diarrhea, dysentery, and intesinal&#13;
infections were reported in 1994 in the region of Timbuktu (4,000) and Mopti-Sevar6 (15,000+); the&#13;
vast majority of these can be attributed to contamination from poor disposal of household waste waters.&#13;
The lack of basic sanitation in Mopti-Sevare also led to a severe outbreak of cholera in 1995, with 700&#13;
cases and 100 deaths reported in the second half of 1995 alone The situation is continuing in 1996;&#13;
cholera is hardly present in other parts of Mali and is largely attributable to poor sanitary conditions&#13;
unique to the regions of Mopti-S&amp;vare, Djenne, and Timbuktu. The provision of basic sanitation will&#13;
thus reduce water-bome morbidity and infant mortality. It will also improve the productivity and income&#13;
of the beneficiary population by reducing time spent caring for sick family memnbers, seeldng medical&#13;
help, as well as by reducing time spent away from productive, wage-earning activities.&#13;
&#13;

5. Marketplaces and Transport Stabions&#13;
The market subcomponent includes the rehabilitatioi of markets in 4 cities, for a total of&#13;
7 projects.  The market in Mopti-Sevare, "Bas Fonds" is a project of CFAF 107.8 million&#13;
(US $213,000), to be financed by IDA. The projected works for transport stations in 5 cities include a&#13;
total of 6 projects. IDA will finance the projects in Bamako, the Medine station and the Djikoroni Para&#13;
station (total CFAF 768 million or US $1.5 million) and in S6vare, the Lyc6e station (total CFAF 504&#13;
million or US $1 million). These works involve the rehabilitation of existing stations, or the&#13;
displacenent of existing stations to more appropriate locations.&#13;
Evaluation Criteria. The rehabilitation of the markets in the regional capitals is geared to improving&#13;
the conditions for presentation and sale of goods and services by merchants. In particular the density of&#13;
market spots and stalls will be reduced, passageways m the market improved, and drainage works&#13;
constructed; the latter will also protect merchants from flooding and decrease losses from damaged or&#13;
destroyed goods. Municipal bus stations are important centers of economic activity, particularly in the&#13;
regional capitals. The works planned in the UDDP will organize and improve the controls of vehicle&#13;
parking and passenger loading, as well as the flows of vehicles, for both passengers and merchandise.&#13;
Mumicipal resources from the fees and taxes associated with markets and transport stations should be&#13;
increased, particularly through higher collection rates. The works in the markets and stations are&#13;
expected to benefit 1.5 million inhabitants. The costs of these projects include capital investment costs,&#13;
operating costs (personnel, vehicle, tickets) and maintanance expenditures (2% of inftiastr rs).&#13;
Benefits generated by the market consist of incremental revenue calculated from market operations; the&#13;
benefits generated by the stations consist of increnental revenues calculated frorn transport flows and&#13;
collection of transport fees and taxes.&#13;
Results. The ERR for the base case for the Mlopti market is estimated at 19%, with a NPV of 37 million&#13;
CFAF (Table 10.3). Sensitivity analysis was conducted, by modifying investment and O&amp;M costs&#13;
(+10%), andthe benefits hypothesis (+10% revenue collection, -10% revenue collection). The sensitivity&#13;
analysis results in ERR ranges of 14 to 24%. The ERR for the base case of the transport stations are&#13;
37% for Bamako and 14% for Sevar6, with NPV of 754 and 46 million CFAF, respectively. Sensitivity&#13;
analysis was conducted, by changing investment and O&amp;M costs (+10%), and the benefits hypothesis&#13;
(full collection of potential revenues). The sensitivity analysis leads to ERR ranges of 32% to 51% for&#13;
Bamako and 12% to 33% for S6var6. These ERRs are underestimated, as no data was available to&#13;
estimate the induced increases in economic activity which are likely to occur from implemerntation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
The results of analysis for markets and stations not financed by IDA are not as positive, partly&#13;
due the dispanty of the cost of some of the rehabilitaton works and induced maintance requiremnents,&#13;
compared with the weaker potential to collect revenues. To increase the profitability potential of these&#13;
municipal investments, the project proposes different solutions: training for local officials and agents to&#13;
improve markets and station operations; pnvatizaton of management, through concession, affermage or&#13;
other options. The viability of these operatons will depend greatly on the actions introduced to improve&#13;
revenue collection.&#13;
6.     Histoiic Cities Component&#13;
The two sub-parts of this component are: (1) creation of an archtecture and rasonry&#13;
workshop to train 150 masons a year over three years on local and traditional methods of building&#13;
conAstrucon and restoration; and (2) improverent of the landscape around the three major mosques,&#13;
which date to the XVWh cetury and serve as a major tourist attraction. The mosques have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
85                                   Page 4 of 21&#13;
maintained by inhabitants through yearly addition of banco, a local earthen plaster; however, in the past&#13;
few years, the lack of resources and skills has led to increasing negJect in the maintenance and restoration&#13;
of the mosques. The architedural workshop will provide for the taining of students in the maintance&#13;
and restoration of the mosques as well as other buildings within and outside of Timbuktu. The&#13;
landscaping around the mosques is necessary to prevent the steady degradation of the walls of the&#13;
mosques caused by constant contact with wastewater from adjacent households, as well as to improve&#13;
pedestrian and vehiide traffic in the adjacent strees and improve the landscape. It would also create a&#13;
more open area near the mosques to welcome visitors and tounsts.&#13;
The ERR's for these two sub-projects are not quantfiable as it is impossible to value the&#13;
cultural, historical, and religious significance of the mosques. The sub-component would benefit the&#13;
local economy by increasing the appeal of the area to tourists and attract foreign currency eamings.&#13;
That potential was estimated at $10 million a year for the whole of the Djenn6-Mopti-Bandiagara-&#13;
Timbuktu area. It also can be assumed that the architectural workshop would have the following&#13;
benefits: (1) assure the future safeguard and upkeep of the mosques and of other buildings of cultural&#13;
and historical importance in Mali; and (2) benefit the local and regional construction industry and&#13;
economy through the addition of skilled and trained workers.&#13;
7.      Fnancial Analysis of EDM&#13;
The analysis of the situation of the Mali electric and water company, Energie du Mali (EDM)&#13;
includes a quick examination of past financial perfomiance, and the presertation of the financial&#13;
forecast, which estimates the impact of the investmeits of this project on the equilibrium of water sector&#13;
operaions.&#13;
Past Financial Performance        Past finanual perfomiance of EDM, for the water sector and for all&#13;
operations are presaited in Tables 10.4A (income Statement) and 10.4 B (Balance Sheet). These results&#13;
are summarized in the table below:&#13;

As the table above indicates, the past financial performance of EDM has bese difficult, at best.&#13;
For the operations of the water sector, there has been little evolution in the volume amount of water sales,&#13;
given the lack of investments to increase water production capaaty. The decline in water sales in 1994&#13;
may reflect the initial reaction to the tariff increases of 1993 and 1994. Thus, despite the 10% decline in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
86                              Page 5 of 21&#13;
volume of sales, 1994 water revenue increased by 15%. In 1995, volume sales retumed to their level of&#13;
1993; however, as more of these sales were based on the social ;ariff of 80 CFAF/m3, the average tariff&#13;
declined by 2%, to 190 CFAF/m3.&#13;
For consolidated EDM operations, slight profits were registered in 1993, and again in 1995.&#13;
For three years in a row, since 1993, operating income was greater than 2 million CFAF. This&#13;
improvement in the operating balance is also evident in the results of the operating ratio, which was&#13;
greater than 1.0 in 1991 and then reached its current value of 0.87. The net results of 1995 may&#13;
translate the first impacts of the management contract and the financial restructuring program. Despite&#13;
water tariff increases (+32% in July 1993, + 10% in February 1994), the water sector has registered a net&#13;
loss since at least 1987. Electricity tariffs were increased by 19% in 1994. The consolidated 1994 net&#13;
losses were significant (-3.2 million CFAF), due principally to two factors: (1) the devaluation of the&#13;
CFA Franc and (2) the provisions for questionable client debts, which had been previously&#13;
underestimated. The CFA Franc devaluation led to an increase of 45% of petroleum products and to a&#13;
doubling of debt service (as EDM bears the exchange risk). CFD debts to the Malian government have&#13;
since been canceled and this cancellation is in the process of being integrated into EDMs accounts (for&#13;
CFAF 16 billion).&#13;
The value of fixed assets increased considerably in 1994, resulting from the integration of the&#13;
water production assets into the books. The return on average net fixed assets in operation for at least&#13;
two years was about -2% in 1991, 1992 and 1994, but registered positive retums of over 4.5% in 1994&#13;
and 3.5% in 1995. The current ratio has also improved since 1991, but EDM suffers from liquidity&#13;
problems due to the high rate of chent receivables, 17.5 billion CFAF in 1995, or the equivalent of 7&#13;
months of billing.&#13;
Dselgahion Globale de Gestion. From January 1995, the managenent of EDM was transferred to a&#13;
consortium of French and Canadian conpanies (SHEC), composed of SAUR, EDF, Hydro-Qu6bec and&#13;
CRC-SOGEMA. This management delegation contract will operate for a period of 4-5 years, financed&#13;
by IDA and the CFD. Included in the objectives of the management contract is the modernization of the&#13;
following services: commercial activities (billing and revenue collection), accounting, managemnent of&#13;
stodcs, computer network for management of client accounts. These projects include an important&#13;
training program for EDM personnel.&#13;
Water Tanffs. Water charges are based on the volume of water consumed; household, public fountain&#13;
and enterprise connections are metered. The current rates are 80 CFAF/m3 for the first 20 rn3 consurned&#13;
per monthly billing period; 198 CFAF for 21 to 60 m3 and 286 CFAF for amounts above 60 rn3. The&#13;
price billed by EDM for water fountains in 80 CFAF/m3, although the price charged to the final&#13;
consumer is generally established at 250 CFAF/m3, or higher.  An industrial rate of 30,000&#13;
CFAF/month plus a single price of 198 CFAF/m3 is available, but only 10 companies in Bamako have&#13;
elected to be billed on this basis.&#13;
The history of water tariffs (Table 10.5) underlines the rarity of water tariff increases. Three&#13;
tiers tariffs based on tranches of monthly consumption were introduced in November 1985; however,&#13;
after this increase, tariffs were not modified for another eight years, until 1993. Although the "social&#13;
tariff' for the first tranche of consumption was not nominally increased in July 1993, the tranche itself&#13;
was modified, with the ceiling lowered from 50 mn3 to 20 tn3. The two higher levels of tariffs were&#13;
increased in tenns of both the tranches and the price. In early 1994, a second increase of 10% was&#13;
implemted for the two superior tranches. The social price as well as the price billed to operators of&#13;
public water fountains was not changed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
87                              Page 6 of 21&#13;
As a result of the stagnation of water tariffs, the difference between average water tariffs/rn3 and&#13;
the average cost of producing water increased from 1986 to 1992 (Table 10.6). This difference led to a&#13;
widening of the "tariff deficit" from 18% in 1986, to almost 59% in 1992 (currert CFAF). The tariff&#13;
increases implemeited in 1993 and 1994 have greatly reduced this deficit to 16% in 1993 and 6% in&#13;
1995. The water tariff per cubic meter for residertial service in Mali is well below that of neighboring&#13;
countries. One of the conditions of this credit is the implemeitation of new water tariffs before June 30,&#13;
1998, as well as any other measures to ensure the equilibrium of water sector operations by June 30,&#13;
2001. As part ofthis strategy, a tariff study is being initiated byEDM.&#13;
Billing and Collection. The inadequacies of EDMs billing and collection system are one of the targets&#13;
of the managemert contract. In 1995, a separate Commercial Division was created to revise the entire&#13;
chain of meter reading, billing and collection. In 1994-1995, client receivables were equal to at least&#13;
seven months of billing. As of June 1996, cumulated unpaid bills for State and Administration clients&#13;
(excluding military) was reduced to only 2.5 months.&#13;
Since 1995, the actions of the Commercial Division have included: creation of four commercial&#13;
agencies in Bamako with specific client files (regional agencies are being created); installation of the&#13;
software program "Galat6e" to improve client and payment follow-up, with a dense network of&#13;
computers in the commercial agencies; a building-to-building census of every meter and connection in&#13;
Bamako and the regions; implementation of a rotation plan for meter readers; more rigorous cutoff&#13;
actions for unpaid accounts; decentralization of minor repairs to the commercial agencies; more stringent&#13;
follow-up on canceled subscribers. Since the beginning of 1996, revenues have been collected at levels&#13;
higher than the previous year (by 8-10%), particularly in Bamako.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing Since at least 1993, EDMs auditors have identified three major problems&#13;
which prevent certification of the accounts. These renmarks are: (1) lack of a reliable inventory of fixed&#13;
assets, as well as discrepancies between files; (2) reservations on the status of client receivables; and&#13;
(3) reservations on accounts of consumption advances paid by clients for new accounts.&#13;
One of the obligations of the management contract is to resolve these outstanding issues for the&#13;
1996 fiscal year, in order for 1996 accounts to be certified. For the first problem, a full invertory and&#13;
study of EDMs fixed assets was undertaken in 1995; the results of this inventory will be integrated in&#13;
EDMs accounts in 1996. The client receivables and client advances for consumption are in the process&#13;
of being resolved by the Commercial Division, on a case by case basis (see above).&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
General. Financial projections were prepared for EDMs water operations, on the basis of the results of&#13;
the report "Etude sur la restructuration financiere de la socie&amp; Energie du Mali", finalized in July 1995.&#13;
The projections are prepared in currert CFAF, with annual domestic inflation esiimated at 4% and&#13;
external inflation at 2.5%. The results of the financial projection are in Tables 10.7A, 10.7B and 10.7C.&#13;
Water Production. Water production estimates are based on on-going and projected works to increase&#13;
production capacity both in Baniako and the regions. In 1998 and 1999, 10,000 m3 and 9,000 m3 of&#13;
additional daily production capacity will become available in Bamako, with the completion of the water&#13;
treatment plant financed by the CFD.&#13;
Svstem Efficiency. Actual water losses in 1994 were 35% of production and 30% in 1995. As part of&#13;
the conditions of this credit, EDM will be implementig a plan to reduce leakage to less than 22% by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
88                              Page 7 of 21&#13;
2001. A diagnostic study of the water network will be undertaken im 1997, in order to formulate a plan&#13;
of action to improve systemn efficiency.&#13;
Income Statement Revenues. With the construction of the distribution network and the addition of&#13;
15,000 individual connections in Bamako, revenues from water activities should increase by 22% in&#13;
1998 and 13% in 1999. Increases in water sales in the following years are estimated at 5% to 6% per&#13;
year, for all of Mali.&#13;
Tariffs. Tariff levels in the projections have been detemiined in order to balance water sector accounts&#13;
by 2001 and to ensure continued account balance once EDM begins repaying IDA and CFD debts; this&#13;
would require a 30% increase in the average tariff in 1998 (to 253 CFAF/m3), a 10% increase in 1999&#13;
and 2000, a 20% increase in 2001, and a further 10% increase in 2002. A tariff study will be conducted&#13;
by EDM as part of the requirement of this credit, to determine viable tariff rates for each tranche, in&#13;
order to reach financial equilibrium within the required time period.&#13;
Expaenses. Operating costs (maiAly electricity and chemicals) and repairs and mafftenance (mainly spare&#13;
parts) are assumed to increase in proportion to the quantity of water supplied. Following a reduction in&#13;
personnel costs in 1995, this item is expected to increase by 5% annually in the following years.&#13;
Common operating costs (such as administration) allocated to water operations are expected to increase&#13;
at about 5% per year.&#13;
Receivables. Uncollectible revenues are estimated as a percentage of revenues, 10% in 1997, and 5% of&#13;
water revenues in the following years.&#13;
Depreciation. Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis at an average annual rate of&#13;
4.5% of average fixed assets. In addition, EDM calculates provisions for renewal of new investmrat,&#13;
also at a rate of 3.3%. From 1995 to 1999, the cost of the management contract (DGG) is included in&#13;
fixed assets, and depreciated over a period of five years. The annual cost is divided proportionally&#13;
between electricity and water sales revenues.&#13;
Income Tax. Income tax on profits is the higher of: (1) 45% of operating result or (2) 0.75% of total&#13;
revenues, in accordance with national legislation on business tax.&#13;
Interest on borrowing. Interest accumulated during construction is capitalized. Interest on CFD loans&#13;
which have been cancelled to GOM are no longer counted in the debt. The debt cancellation will be&#13;
int~rated into the 1996 accounts of EDM, although the modalities for this operation have not yet been&#13;
finalized with the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Balance Sheet and Funds Flow Statement Fixed Assets. Fixed assets are increased by transfers as&#13;
works on these elernents advance. EDMs fixed assets have not yet been revalued following the&#13;
devaluation of the CFAF in 1994. These projections do not take account of the revaluation.&#13;
Receivables. Client accounts reflect the plan of EDMs financial retruturing to bring receivables to the&#13;
level of 2 months average billing by 1998.&#13;
Borrowing. The proposed project will be funded by an IDA credit of US $7.6 million and a CFD credit&#13;
of a!out FF 34 million. Ihe IDA credit will be on-lent to EDM over penod of 20 years, with a five-year&#13;
grace period and an initial interest estimated at 7.70%. The CFD credit will be leit directly to EDM,&#13;
for 19 years, with 7 years grace, and a 2% interest rate. Other outstanding debt for the water sector&#13;
include an OPEC loan for the Bamako water network, the CFD FF 50 million loan for the Bamako&#13;
&#13;

water treatment plant (currertly being disbursed) and 10% (or 2 mn SDR) of the 1982 IDA loan for the&#13;
electricity and water network.&#13;
8. Water Supply Component - Economic Analysis&#13;
The water supply component will include the following works: (1) installation of a transmission&#13;
and distribution network to add 15,000 individual connections in Bamako; (2) addition of 77 water&#13;
fountains in Bamako, to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods; (3) installation of a&#13;
transrmission and distnbution network for 1,000 individual connections and 38 water fountains in Mopti;&#13;
(4) the construction of three reservoirs on the southern side of the city of Bamako. The works to be&#13;
constructed are expected to have a thirty year life.&#13;
Average consumption of water per connected household is estimated to be 35 m3/month. The&#13;
first 20 m3 are currently billed at 80 CFAF/m3, and consumption above 20 m3 is billed at 198 CFAF/m3.&#13;
For the econonic viability of the project, to cover operating costs, these tariffs would require a 30%&#13;
increase in 1998, a 10% increase in 1999 and 2000, a 20% increase in 2001, and a further 10% increase&#13;
in 2002. Given the high demand for water in the neighborhoods that will be supplied through this&#13;
project, the network is expected to remain fully utilized at the levels estimated in this analysis throughout&#13;
its thirty-year life. This addition to the network will increase the total capacity by 8,171,000 rn3 in&#13;
Bamako and 664,000 m3 in Mopt in 2002. Due to system leakage 20% of the water distributed is&#13;
assumed to be lost.&#13;
An estimated 275,000 inhabitants are to benefit from these works. The economic rate of return for the&#13;
water supply component is calculated by estimating the incremental benefits resulting from the new&#13;
water transmission and distribution network of this project.&#13;
Costs. The costs for this component are comprised of the capital investment costs and the incremental&#13;
operating costs. The incremental operating costs do not include indirect expenses such as depreciation,&#13;
taxation, and debt service. A four percent annual increase in operating costs is assumed until 2002,&#13;
when the system becomes fully operational.&#13;
Benefits. The benefits are the incremental revenue eamed from the sale of water supplied by the project,&#13;
which is a proxy for consumers' willingness to pay for water. It is assumed that without this project, the&#13;
distribution of potable water would remain at its current levels.&#13;
Results. The ERR for the project is estimated at 12% with a net present value of (60 million) CFAF&#13;
using a 12% discount rate (Tables 10.8 A and 10.8 B). This project component has other benefits such&#13;
as time savings, improved sanitary conditions. improved health, reduction in water-bome diseases such&#13;
as dysentery, cholera, and typhoid. These advantages will be observed for the water fountains to&#13;
improve living conditions in Bamako's poorest neighborhoods, as well as the connections in Bamako, and&#13;
the connections/water fountains in Mopti. Sensitivity analysis was tested for a 15% increase in&#13;
investment costs and total costs, a 15% decrease in production yield, 10% non-payment by subscribers&#13;
and for a two-year delay in implementation. The ERR's for these sensitivity runs range from 8 to 12%.&#13;
Risks. The main risk of this sub-component is the failure of EDM to implement the installation and&#13;
operation of the water supply network.. However, the ongoing investment to increase water treatment&#13;
capacity, financed by a credit of FF 50 million from the CFD demonstrates that EDM has the capacity&#13;
to successfully implement large physical works. Another risk is that a significant percentage of&#13;
customers will refuse to pay their bills. This risk is mitigated by the fact that EDM's commercial service&#13;
(billing and collection division), is currently implementing a system to detect non-payments in a timely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;

manner and institute a service shut-off within a short period of time, reducing the losses incurred by&#13;
unpaid bills. A final risk is the long-term financial viability of EDM being threatened by the inability to&#13;
raise tariffs to cover its expenses and to keep up with inflation. This risk can be minimized if the GOM&#13;
permits the utility to raise its water tariffs to cover operating costs and generate a reasonable return on&#13;
investment. Continued Bank supervision and governmental support is necessary to mitigate all the above&#13;
mentioned risks.&#13;
9.     Land Development for Housing Component&#13;
The land development for housing subcomponent includes two sites in Bamako: Baco Djikoroni&#13;
Sud financed by IDA, where 5,000 plots will be developed with sites and services and auctioned off by&#13;
ACI, and Yrimadio, where 5,000 partially serviced plots will be prepared.&#13;
Evaluation cntena. The benefits of these developments include better access by urban populations to&#13;
municipal and pnvate services (water, electricity, transportation), higher quality of housing, a greater&#13;
stake by local residents in the urban environment through accession to property, and savings in repair&#13;
and rehabilitation costs, due to less water damage with improved drainage and road works. Many of&#13;
these benefits may not be direcdy quantifiable, but are partially reflected through the differential of rental&#13;
values. The Baco Djikoroni site is to be developed without occasioning any displacement and re-housing&#13;
of local residents. The applied rate for annual operation and maintenance costs is 7% of the investment&#13;
cost. Anticipated benefits are measured comnpared to the differential of the estimated rental value of&#13;
these housing sites, with and without the project. Differential rental values are a proxy for estimating the&#13;
increase in the value of land wealth. An expected 50,000 inhabitants will benefit from this component.&#13;
Information on projected costs and benefits were either collected during the course of the&#13;
feasibility study, or projected on the basis of existing data (from the Bamako 10-Year Investment&#13;
Program). The results of these analyses are contained in the Projeat File.&#13;
Results. The results for the base case indicate a high level of economic justification for these works, with&#13;
an ERR of 43% in both sites. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, by changing investment and O&amp;M&#13;
costs (+ 15%) and the benefits hypothesis (+10% Rental Value, -10% Rental Value). The results of the&#13;
sensitivity analysis result in ERR ranges of 13 to 56% for Baco Djikoroni and 15 to 55% for Yrimadio&#13;
(Table 10.9).&#13;

REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
IMPACT ENVIRONNEMENTAL&#13;
The Urban and Environmental Context&#13;
1.    In 1995, the urban population of Mali was 2.25 million, out of a total population of 9 rnillion. The&#13;
rate of increase for the urban population is about 5% per year, compared with 2.5% for the country as a&#13;
whole. By the year 2010, the urban population will probably be 7 million. Bamako currently has 900,000&#13;
inhabitants, and is likely to have 1.9 million by 2010, and the total for the country's other cities will&#13;
increase from 1.4 million to 2.5 million. Urban poverty is increasing at a rapid pace, and employment&#13;
opportunities are few. The resources of the 14 municipalities affected by the project are meager, as are&#13;
their financial and management capacities (i.e. human and physical resources), and this is true of both&#13;
Bamako and the secondary cities. The quality of infrastructure and superstructure varies greatly from one&#13;
city to another, and even from one district to another within the same city. The real estate market operates&#13;
unsatisfactorily, in spite of recent innovations by ACI (Agence de cessions immobilieres: the Land&#13;
Auctioning Agency). The environment is in a delicate condition in all of the cities, but the situation varies&#13;
from one city to another and from one district to another within the same city. The main damage to the&#13;
environment comes from the disposal of rainwater and from water-table pollution (particularly in Bamako&#13;
and Mopti). The lack of basic infrastructure is especially harmful to the poor, and affects public health. In&#13;
Mopti, there are frequent epidemics (of cholera and dysentery), with high morbidity and death rates.&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
2.    Overall, the proposed project will have a very positive impact on the environment, because of the&#13;
nature of certain components (particularly water supply and sanitation), and the sustainability of project&#13;
activities resulting from institutional changes, the introduction of cost recovery, and training and awareness&#13;
programs. The environmental assessment was preceded by a diagnostic study of the impacts of the First&#13;
and Second Urban Projects, which had very positive effects on the environment in Bamako. The project&#13;
will have the following two main types of environmental impact: (a) on spatial aspects of the environment,&#13;
as a result of the components relating to the planning of housing land and to roads and drainage; (b) on&#13;
health, mainly due to the water supply component and the wastewater and solid waste disposal&#13;
subcomponents. The main issue in urban environmental problems is the behavior of the inhabitants in such&#13;
inadequately serviced cities, since they are mostly from rural backgrounds and eam low incomes.&#13;
3.    The main project impacts can be summarized as follows: (a) pressure on natural water resources,&#13;
since the population is accustomed to drawing its water supply from the aquifer via wells; (b) disruption of&#13;
natural water flows by the construction of roads; (c) direct water supply from shallow boreholes in three&#13;
districts of Bamako; (d) risks to water in transport stations and marketplaces resulting from the proximity&#13;
of technical or health facilities, and risks to water due to the dumping of used motor oil. The project will&#13;
combine public health activities with the management of the urban environment through the following&#13;
measures: (i) upgrading of certain environmental activities such as water supply in Bamako and Mopti-&#13;
Sevare, the strategic sanitation plan for Mopti-Sevar6, and the strategic solid waste management plan for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                                 Annex 11&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
Bamako; (ii) awareness programs with regard to the urban environment at national and local levels (i.e. in&#13;
municipalities and communities), and preparation of a sanitation strategy for Bamako; (iii) where necessary,&#13;
mitigation of certain effects of project subcomponents (i.e. urban roads, marketplaces, and transport&#13;
stations), together with improvements in environmental quality whenever possible, particularly in the&#13;
subcomponents relating to roads and the trading infrastructure.&#13;
Mitigation Measures&#13;
4.     The mitigation measures planned in the project concem the following five types of action, which are&#13;
detailed in the attached table:  (a) the inclusion in subproject implementation studies of detailed&#13;
environmental assessments and mitigation measures, regardless of the other environmental studies provided&#13;
for in the project, which include the strategic plan for the management of solid waste in Bamako and toxic&#13;
pollution from industries in Bamako, and the environmental enhancement of historic sites and settlements;&#13;
(b) capital investment for the improvement of the environment, such as drainage, landscaping, the protection&#13;
of outfall areas of drainage channels in the Niger River, etc.; (c) very widespread, ongoing training and&#13;
awareness programs at all levels, particularly in individual city districts, and training of trainers;&#13;
(d) institutional measures for preventing the construction and use of wells, and establishment of consultation&#13;
and monitoring mechanisms in Mopti and Bamako, with representatives of the Government, communities,&#13;
users, and service providers; (e) a monitoring and supervision plan, with all relevant indicators, including&#13;
health. Providing for mitigation measures and their monitoring and supervision will require a budget of&#13;
about US$600,000, and this is included under the "Studies" subcomponent of the water supply component.&#13;
The Institutional Framework for Environmental Management&#13;
5.    In principle, the main partners will be those parties most directly concerned with the problems in&#13;
the field; namely, the Secretaries General of municipalities, and the technical staff of other bodies, i.e.&#13;
AGETIPE, EDM (Energie du Mali), DNHPA (the National Directorate of Public Health and Sanitation),&#13;
DNHE (the National Directorate of Water Resources and Energy), and ACI (the Land Auctioning Agency).&#13;
MUH (the Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing) will play a leadership role through the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit. As regards legislative and regulatory aspects, and although the use of this latter type of&#13;
mechanism must be approached with great caution (since it is difficult to operate and its effectiveness&#13;
cannot be taken for granted), close links must be maintained with operations at national level (i.e. the&#13;
NEAP), in order both to draw lessons from them and to increase staff awareness, particularly with respect&#13;
to the experience acquired as the project progresses. Environmental activities will have to be coordinated,&#13;
and the Project Coordination Unit should assume this role, or else delegate it to one of the partners referred&#13;
to above, provided that the one selected is motivated and concemed. Every year the environmental aspects&#13;
of the project must be reviewed and a report issued containing a certain number of monitoring indicators.&#13;
This would be done in parallel to the work performed on the basis of the urban data prepared using the IPE&#13;
(Inventaire pour la Programmation des Infrastructures et Equipements: the Infrastructure Planning&#13;
Inventory). Such indicators could relate to health (e.g. pollution and epidemiology) and also public&#13;
infrastructure, with reference to health (water supply, sanitation, drainage, and clinics) and socioeconomic&#13;
issues (marketplaces, transport stations, and schools). In this latter case, the IPIE should be used (i.e. the&#13;
urban database and indicators of individual infrastructure).&#13;
