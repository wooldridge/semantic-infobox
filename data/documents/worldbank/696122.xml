A.    BACKGROUND&#13;
Employment Situation&#13;
1.    Unemployment is one of the most fundamental post-war issues that Bosnia and Herzegovina has&#13;
to face. After four years of war, economic activity is virtually at a standstill with estimates of the current&#13;
gross national product ranging from 5-15 percent of pre-war levels. The collapse of the economy means&#13;
that today the unemployment rate is nearly double that in 1991. About 50-60 percent of the current labor&#13;
force of 1I.1 million are estimated to be formally unemployed. This figure is even higher if one takes into&#13;
account those who once had formal sector jobs but now rely on informal sector activities and agriculture&#13;
to make a living. Of particular concern, are the employment prospects of those most directly affected by&#13;
the war -- the internally displaced, demobilized soldiers, war widows, war invalids and returning&#13;
refugees -- many of whom lost both their homes and their jobs during the war and are now dependent on&#13;
humanitarian assistance.&#13;
2.    Creating employment is critical for peace and prosperity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly&#13;
for those most directly affected by the war. Reconstruction and economic recovery will generate&#13;
employment, but not fast enough to absorb the large numbers of unemployed in the short run. And such&#13;
growth may not create opportunities for the most economically-disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.&#13;
Hence, the need for active employment policies that target the most vulnerable groups and help them&#13;
make the transition from dependence on humanitarian assistance to active employment.&#13;
Self Employment and Microenterprise Development&#13;
3.    Job creation based on self-employment and micro and small enterprise development is likely to&#13;
play a key role in the reduction of the high unemployment rate and the post-war recovery and transition&#13;
towards a free market economy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is a structural trend toward high&#13;
shares of self-employment in the economies of virtually all industrialized countries. This is in large part&#13;
due to declining employment in corporate sectors, the growing importance of services in the economy&#13;
and advanced communication technologies. During the 1980s, non-agricultural self-employment in&#13;
OECD countries grew faster than total employment and accounted for almost 12% of all employment by&#13;
the early 1990s.&#13;
4.    Self-employment plays a particularly important role in post-socialist countries. According to&#13;
OECD', since 1990 there has been a remarkable increase in non-agricultural self-employment in post-&#13;
socialist countries, pushed by increasing unemployment and comparatively weak social safety nets and&#13;
pulled by new economic opportunities. Between 1989 and 1994, the number of non-agricultural self-&#13;
employed rose from 8,000 to 460,000 in the Czech Republic, from 315,000 to 562,000 in Hungary and&#13;
from 650,000 to 1.4 million in Poland. Self-employment in these three countries represented between&#13;
10-15% of the economically active labor force in 1994 and has been the primary means of employment&#13;
for many people made redundant by the state sector.&#13;
5.    By fostering entrepreneurship and educating a business class that "learns by doing" and&#13;
progressively accumulates capital, self-employment can provide a very significant stimulus for economic&#13;
development and privatization. And the financial and social costs of promoting self-employment are less&#13;

than the cost of unemployment. In Poland the average cost of creating a job ranges from US$550- 1,000&#13;
under microenterprise promotion schemes supported by the World Bank2 which compares favorably with&#13;
the alternative of unemployment benefits, which average about US$ 1,000 per person per year.&#13;
6.     Successful promotion of self-employment depends on fledgling entrepreneurs' having long-term&#13;
reliable access to credit to finance working capital and investment needs. Over the past 15 years, major&#13;
developments in the delivery of financial services to low-income people have taken place, and provision&#13;
of small loans to low-income people is increasingly accepted as an effective instrument against&#13;
unemployment and poverty. Experience has shown that low-income people can undertake income-&#13;
generating activities, and they can repay loans-often at high real positive interest rates. Commercial&#13;
banks are generally not interested in this clientele, because of the relatively high transaction costs of&#13;
processing such small loan amounts or because of borrowers' lack of collateral. This has led to a&#13;
proliferation throughout the world of informal micro-finance institutions which have developed cost-&#13;
effective lending technologies capable of reaching the poor with very small loans.&#13;
7.    Access to credit by the self-employed and microentrepreneurs is extremely limited in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina today. Banks in Bosnia, whether state-owned or private, have only limited amounts of&#13;
deposit resources due to a general lack of confidence in the banking system on the part of the general&#13;
public. As a consequence, credit is severely restricted and expensive (up to 5 percent per month).&#13;
Available credit is mostly very short term, reflecting the short maturity of deposits and is mostly for&#13;
trade activities. While average loan size is small by international standards at about DM 100,000, few if&#13;
any loans are extended in amounts below DM 50,000. Lending is not so much based on collateral as it is&#13;
based on relationship, particularly with the banks' own shareholders. Credit availability has improved&#13;
with the start-up of two donor financed credit lines (IDA and USAID). However, loans under these&#13;
programs range from about DM 100,000-DM 1,000,000 and tend to benefit existing medium-sized&#13;
enterprises. In this environment, access to formal credit by microentrepreneurs is extremely limited.&#13;
There is also little evidence that informal financial systems have emerged on any scale to compensate the&#13;
shortage of formal credit. As a consequence, the development of micro and small businesses whose&#13;
contribution to the future growth of employment and production is critical to the country could be&#13;
stunted by insufficient access to finance.&#13;
Constraints to Microenterprise Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
8.    The legacies of war and socialism have created a very difficult business environment in Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina, particularly for very small businesses. The following represent some of the most&#13;
critical constraints:&#13;
* The small size and fragmentation of markets. Demand for goods and services in Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina is limited (though growing with post-war economic recovery). The&#13;
dramatic fall in income during the war and the territorial division and restrictions of&#13;
movement between the Federation and Republika Srpska have reduced the purchasing&#13;
power of the population and the size of the local market. Those markets which are active at&#13;
this point focus mainly on basic needs for housing repair, food and clothing. However, even&#13;
in these areas, local producers are faced with fierce competition from imported goods which&#13;
are often cheaper and of higher quality than goods produced locally. Plus the extensive&#13;
damage to communication and transport networks further limits market opportunities.&#13;

*   A difficult legal and regulatory framework for business.  The complex regulatory&#13;
environment prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides a strong disincentive for&#13;
microbusinesses.   Registration of enterprises, either as sole proprietorships or as&#13;
incorporated businesses, is problematic first, because registration fees are very high3 and&#13;
second, because of restrictions that accompany registration, e.g., people are confined to&#13;
those specific activities and locations for which they have registered, and have to provide&#13;
proof of the qualifications necessary for the business that they are registering. Regulations&#13;
on trading activities are particularly onerous for small businesses. There is considerable&#13;
confusion about what constitutes "black market" activities: for some, "black market" is&#13;
synonymous with smuggling and for others, acquiring goods in one location in-country for&#13;
re-sale in another qualifies as "black market".&#13;
*   A burdensome tax regime. There is a heavy burden of taxes and charges on business in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The most burdensome tax on all enterprises, including&#13;
microenterprises, are salary taxes-payroll taxes and social security contributions together&#13;
absorb approximately 50 percent of gross salary. Added to this sole proprietorship and&#13;
small incorporated businesses (the primary beneficiaries of this Project) are subject to a&#13;
profit tax at a flat rate of 36 percent. This is a high tax for small businesses making very&#13;
4&#13;
low profits, although start-up businesses are given certain tax exemptions . Business are&#13;
also subject to various sales taxes which range from 0-26 percent, with high rates applied to&#13;
luxury goods and low rates to primary goods.&#13;
*   Lack of access to credit.  Sources of start-up capital in Bosnia and Herzegovina are&#13;
currently extremely limited, and there is little or no access to working or investment capital&#13;
for microenterprises. Most Bosnian commercial banks lend only to large enterprises at&#13;
short maturities and with high interest rates (up to 5% per month). Both the World Bank&#13;
and USAID are financing lines of credit through the banking system aimed at small and&#13;
medium enterprises. Loan sizes range from about 50,000DM-1,000,00ODM under the two&#13;
programs with annual interest rates of about 8.5%. However, these lines of credit do not&#13;
serve microentrepreneurs with credit needs of less than 50,000DM, let alone less than&#13;
10,000DM. Microentrepreneurs who are fortunate can draw upon remaining personal&#13;
savings or remittances from relatives abroad. The majority, however, lack access to credit&#13;
as the existing banks are neither disposed nor well-positioned to extend the very small loans&#13;
that are needed by this population group.&#13;
*   Lack of access to business training and advice. Many people now face the necessity of&#13;
earning an income from a small-scale economic activity, and need to adapt their skills to&#13;
private business. Given the state sector background of many people, design and marketing&#13;
skills are particularly poor. As Bosnia privatizes and opens its economy, competition will&#13;
3&#13;
The registration fee for sole proprietorships registered at the Municipal Office of the Economy varies from 50&#13;
DM to 400 DM, depending on the activity. Additional fees are charged to shift or stop the registered activity.&#13;
The entrepreneur must open a bank account and leave 300 DM on deposit. Small-scale entrepreneurs wishing to&#13;
register their business as a company must register both with the Municipality and with the courts. Registration&#13;
fees for such incorporated business are around 2,000 DM and the required bank deposit is 1,000 DM.&#13;
4&#13;
New businesses are granted 100% exemption from profit tax in their first year of business, 70% in year 2 and&#13;
30% in year 3. People with part-time, home-based businesses and no other formal job are not subject to this tax.&#13;

increase. Business skills and acumen will increasingly be needed to survive even among the&#13;
smallest businesses. This places a premium on business advice and training services, which&#13;
currently are lacking.&#13;
*   Lack of access to business space. Access to even the most basic business facilities is&#13;
problematic for many fledgling entrepreneurs-particularly those in the most war-affected&#13;
urban areas. The shortage is due to widespread destruction of property and to substantial&#13;
state ownership of property.&#13;
B.    BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
9.     On April 1, 1996, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) fulfilled the conditions of succession to the&#13;
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC. Membership is&#13;
retroactive to February 25, 1993.&#13;
10.    Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-funded&#13;
reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the Bank, IMF, EU and EBRD in late 1995 resulted&#13;
in the proposed Priority Reconstruction Program which was first presented to a donors' meeting, co-&#13;
sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels, a week after the signing of the Paris/Dayton Peace&#13;
Agreement. This meeting led to donor commitments of about US$600 million for immediate&#13;
reconstruction activities. A second donors' conference, again co-chaired by the Bank and the EU, was&#13;
held in mid-April 1996, and resulted in additional donor pledges on the order of US$1.2 billion for&#13;
financing priority reconstruction activities during 1996.&#13;
11.    The Bank has been following a broad-based assistance strategy, which seeks to leverage its&#13;
limited resources with significant resource transfer from donors. Before arrears resolution, the Bank&#13;
supported a series of immediate assistance programs through a special Trust Fund for Reconstruction of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH) which is providing US$125 million on concessional terms equivalent to&#13;
those offered by IDA, as well as an additional US$25 million in grant funds. Seven emergency&#13;
operations, committing the entire US$150 million, were approved under the TFBH. The resolution of&#13;
arrears, made possible by the Consolidation Loan package, allowed regular IDA lending to begin in June&#13;
1996. The Bank is continuing to focus on supporting the reconstruction program in the infrastructure and&#13;
social sectors, with special emphasis on employment creation. Its assistance program has also been&#13;
broadened to include support for the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional&#13;
reforms. The Transition Assistance Credit, approved by the Board in September 1996, was the first&#13;
operation focusing on major institutional issues of the Federation and a series of structural reforms that&#13;
are needed for advancing the transition to a market-economy. Further policy-enhancing investment or&#13;
adjustment operations are envisaged to support institution-building at the state and entity level, in the&#13;
financial sector as well as trade liberalization. In the area of reconstruction, future Bank operations will&#13;
support the recovery of industry and employment generation, the rehabilitation of infrastructure (energy&#13;
and transport), agriculture (forestry) and basic social services (health and education). Limited IDA (ITF)&#13;
resources will continue to make partnerships with other donors key.&#13;

Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Experience&#13;
12.    To learn about the needs and constraints of the unemployed and microentrepreneurs in Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina and about appropriate credit methodologies for reaching this group, a Pilot project&#13;
financed by a Dutch Trust Fund administered by the World Bank was started up in Tuz]a in February&#13;
1996. A Steering Committee chaired by the Canton Minister of Reconstruction, Development and&#13;
Enterprise and comprising representatives of the Tuzla Agency for Local Development Initiatives&#13;
(TALDI), the Tuzla Commercial Bank, UNHCR and the World Bank setected three projects to be&#13;
implemented by local and international noni-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Tuzia. In August&#13;
1996, the pilot was extended to the rest of the Federation with financing from UNHCR. Four more local&#13;
NGOs were selected and trained to start-up microcredit programs in Bihac, Gorazde, Mostar and&#13;
Sarajevo. See Appendix 1 for a description of these institutions and their microcredit operations.&#13;
13.    The most important lessons learned from the pilot project thus far include the following:&#13;
a) Entrepreneur Level:&#13;
*   A new entrepreneurial class is emerging in Bosnia among low-income people, who are&#13;
increasingly aware of the collapse and uncertain future of their former state-enterprise jobs&#13;
and the necessity of starting up their own businesses. While most of these people keep to&#13;
their traditional skills, some try to penetrate the "imagination barrier" and develop new&#13;
business opportunities.&#13;
Survey evidence suggests that the unmet demand for credit in small amounts (from 500 to&#13;
10,000 DM) is very high and that microentrepreneurs are prepared to pay relatively high&#13;
5&#13;
interest rates (10-20 percent per annum).&#13;
-   People in rural areas have a comparative advantage in developing microbusinesses because&#13;
of higher savings and easier access to business space than those in the towns; on the other&#13;
hand they have more limited access to markets.&#13;
b) Government Level:&#13;
*   A central planning approach remains with a certain mistrust of the individual entrepreneur&#13;
and NGO microcredit service providers.&#13;
*   Officials are most concerned about how to revitalize large-scale production rather than&#13;
respond to market demand and promote microentrepreneurship.&#13;
*   A strong bias against informal trading activities appears almost universal, as well as a bias&#13;
in favor of larger enterprises.&#13;
*   This highlights the need to raise the awareness of Government officials of the economic&#13;
benefits of increasing access to credit for individual microentrepreneurs, the importance of&#13;
informal trade activities as a basis for entrepreneurship, as well as the role of non-bank&#13;
financial institutions.&#13;

c) Microcredit Service Provider Level:&#13;
* There is a tremendous need for support and training to build institutional capacity in&#13;
microcredit delivery, where there is very limited prior experience in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina.&#13;
* Microcredit service providers are conducting their activities in an ambiguous legal&#13;
environment. Ambiguities are caused by, among other things, the absence of clearly&#13;
applicable legislation governing the creation and general powers of non-profit, non-&#13;
governmental organizations; lack of clarity as to the permissibility of economic activities by&#13;
such organizations, particularly borrowing and lending activities; and rapid and incomplete&#13;
change in legislation and practice governing banking and credit generally. However, a&#13;
sufficient legal basis does exist for the implementation of this Project.&#13;
* Microcredit service providers have been very successful in linking their microcredit&#13;
operations with local commercial banks in charge of liquidity management, in spite of the&#13;
ambiguous legal environment.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
14.    There are four main reasons for promoting self-employment and microentrepreneurship in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina through delivery of microcredit and related business services:&#13;
* First, is the urgent need to assist people make the transition away from unemployment and&#13;
dependency on humanitarian assistance to active employment and income generation.&#13;
Active assistance in the form of microcredit and other business support can be a key factor in&#13;
helping many war-affected groups, such as displaced women and demobilized soldiers,&#13;
reenter the economy and look toward the future, rather than remaining passive and&#13;
dependent on humanitarian assistance. This is a top priority of both the Government and the&#13;
major donors.&#13;
* Second, with the collapse of state enterprises and the transition towards a more market-&#13;
oriented, private sector economy, self-employment and microenterprises are likely to play an&#13;
important role in the future Bosnian economy but need support if this potential is to be&#13;
fulfilled.&#13;
* Third, promotion of self-employment through microenterprise development can be a cost-&#13;
effective alternative to long-term dependency on unemployment benefits which would&#13;
otherwise result. Job creation through microenterprise financing is generally more cost-&#13;
effective than annual unemployment benefits. Active employment also reduces the social&#13;
problems associated with high rates of unemployment. This is a central concern in Bosnia,&#13;
where fears exist that lack of work is one factor that could contribute to renewed social&#13;
unrest.&#13;
* Finally, the approach taken in this Project, namely to build the capacity of non-governmental&#13;
organizations as microcredit service providers, will strengthen the capacity and&#13;
sustainability of the NGO sector in Bosnia. Strengthening the NGO sector is part of the&#13;
broader task of increasing the role of civil society in development which is increasingly&#13;
recognized as a prerequisite for democratic and broad-based development. Such efforts are&#13;
particularly necessary in the post-conflict environment of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;

Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
15.    The Project would complement several other projects, particularly the Demobilization and -&#13;
Reintegration Project-which aims to assist the economic reintegration of the unemployed, particularly&#13;
demobilized soldiers, into the civilian workforce by financing job counseling, training and education-&#13;
and the Public Works and Employment Project-which aims to create rapid employment for those&#13;
unemployed or displaced as a result of war, by financing labor-intensive, local public works projects.&#13;
Microcredit available under the Local Initiatives Project could be complemented with business or&#13;
vocational training financed under the Demobilization and Reintegration Project. The Public Works and&#13;
Employment Project is complementary in the sense that it provides temporary employment, while the&#13;
Local Initiatives Project will support permanent employment through the development of micro and&#13;
small businesses. The Project would also complement the Emergency Recovery Project's Social Welfare&#13;
Fund-which provides cash payments to an estimated 250,000 persons during the transition period-by&#13;
providing an active employment policy as an alternative to cash payments, and by helping to prevent&#13;
long-term dependency on social welfare.&#13;
16.   In terms of projects that provide financial support to the private sector, this Project helps broaden&#13;
the range of financial services available in Bosnia and Herzegovina across the full size range of private&#13;
enterprises using institutional mechanisms appropriate to the needs of the borrowers. At the top end of&#13;
small-medium enterprise sector, the Emergency Recovery Project's (ERP) Revolving Line of Credit&#13;
program provides bank loans through the existing banking system up to 300,000DM. In the middle of&#13;
the range, the IFC is proposing to support the start-up of a specialized commercial microcredit bank&#13;
which would provide micro and small enterprises with loans up to 30,000DM. The Local Initiatives&#13;
Project targets the lowest end of the microenterprise sector by providing grassroots financial&#13;
intermediation for potential microentrepreneurs who would not normally have direct access to banks up&#13;
to a maximum loan size of 10,OOODM. The IFC-sponsored bank would be expected to have a&#13;
considerable impact on restarting micro and small enterprises affected by the war, targeting a market&#13;
extremely under served at this time by existing commercial financial institutions. The Local Initiatives&#13;
Project, on the other hand, is targeting a more vulnerable population, some of whom will have no prior&#13;
business experience -- displaced women, returning refugees, demobilized soldiers -- that would not&#13;
normally be reached by such a for-profit institution. Credits would therefore be delivered by non-&#13;
governmental organizations with a good knowledge of their client base and a track record in delivering&#13;
microcredit or other services to the target population. The credit (loans up to 10,000 DM) would serve as&#13;
a social and psychological tool in addition to a financial tool. Some of the NGO service providers are&#13;
expected to reach financial sustainability, however, given the start-up nature of these programs this is not&#13;
expected of them all (see para. 24). There is a possibility of overlap between the two projects for&#13;
borrowers who are restarting previously existing microenterprises (with credit needs in the range of&#13;
6,000-10.000 DM). However, clients of the Local Initiatives Project would be able to receive technical&#13;
assistance and training support from the service providers in addition to purely financial services.&#13;
T ogether, these IDA/IFC projects form a continuum addressing urgent micro and small credit needs and&#13;
broadening and deepening the financial services available in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;

C.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
17.   The Project's primary objective is to:&#13;
address the urgent need to assist economically-disadvantaged and war-affected groups in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina restart economic activities and make the transition from dependence&#13;
on humanitarian assistance to active employment. This will be achieved by disbursing about&#13;
7,000-10,000 subloans up to a maximum of 10,000 DM each for income-generating&#13;
activities based on self-employment and microenterprises.6&#13;
The Project's secondary objectives are to:&#13;
*  jump-start the 5-10 year process of establishing financially viable microcredit institutions in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina, by contracting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which&#13;
meet specified eligibility criteria to disburse these loans and providing them with the&#13;
technical support and incentives to develop high-performing operations, especially as&#13;
regards repayments, operational efficiency and increasing financial self-sufficiency; and&#13;
* provide feedback to the Government and support improvement of the business environment&#13;
for the start up and expansion of self-employment and micro and small businesses, as well as&#13;
the environment for non-bank microfinance institutions.&#13;
18.    The Project's target population comprises economically disadvantaged persons and micro-&#13;
entrepreneurs who do not have access to business loans from commercial financial institutions,&#13;
including: (a) those most directly affected by the war, namely displaced persons, war widows, war&#13;
invalids, and returning refugees; (b) small farmers, rural unemployed and microentrepreneurs; and (c)&#13;
urban unemployed and microentrepreneurs, especially demobilized soldiers.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
19.    To support the above objectives, the Project will have three components that would be&#13;
implemented in both the Federation and Republika Srpska: (a) microcredit programs; (b) microfinance&#13;
institutional capacity building; and (c) establishment of a Local Initiatives Department in the&#13;
Employment and Training Foundations (ETF) to be responsible for overall project management.&#13;
Component 1: Microcredit Programs (US$15 million or 85% of total cost)&#13;
20.   Under the Project, about 7,000-10,000 small loans would be provided for income-generating&#13;
activities and microbusinesses for displaced persons and returnees, especially war widows; small&#13;
farmers, rural unemployed and microentrepreneurs; and urban unemployed and microentrepreneurs,&#13;
especially demobilized soldiers.  In order to disburse the microloans, the ETF Local Initiatives&#13;
Departments would contract an estimated 12-18 microcredit service providers (non-Governmental legal&#13;
entities) as agents in the Federation and Republika Srpska, to implement programs to approve, supervise,&#13;
and follow up the collection of microloans and to provide related non-financial microbusiness services to&#13;
borrowers (such as business training, marketing advice and business incubator services). Microcredit&#13;
6 Microenterprise /microbusiness is defined as less than 5 employees (mainly family businesses).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Page 9 of 23&#13;
service providers would receive a management fee in order to cover the direct operating costs of&#13;
administering the loan fund. Project financing under this component would be provided for both: (a)&#13;
small-scale credit, and (b) management fees to service providers.&#13;
21.   Subloan Size and Target Populations. For indicative purposes only, it has been estimated that&#13;
microcredit programs are likely to fall within three main categories, corresponding to three broad&#13;
economic levels of the target population:&#13;
(a) Loan size from 100-1,500 DM. Main loan clients: displaced persons, mainly war widows and other&#13;
poor women, from rural areas who are largely unskilled and are currently completely dependent on&#13;
humanitarian assistance for survival. Loans would be mainly for small income-generating activities&#13;
that would allow the beneficiaries to earn some supplemental income and to take the first steps&#13;
toward regaining economic autonomy. An estimated US$1.3 million (12 %) of the loan fund would&#13;
be targeted to this group, corresponding to about 3,800-4,300 subloans averaging 700 DM.&#13;
(b) Loan size from 1,000-5,000 DM. Main loan clients: farmers and microentrepreneurs in villages;&#13;
displaced persons returning to their homes. Loans would be mainly for self-employment or home-&#13;
based microenterprises. An estimated US$4.3 million (38%) of the loan fund would be targeted to&#13;
this group, corresponding to about 2,800-3,300 subloans averaging 3,000 DM.&#13;
(c) Loan size from 5,000-10,000 DM. Main loan clients: unemployed and microentrepreneurs in urban&#13;
areas, particularly demobilized soldiers. Loans would be used for start up or expansion of self-&#13;
employment and microenterprises. An estimated US$5.6 million (50%) of the loan fund would be&#13;
targeted to this group, corresponding to about 1,600-2,100 subloans averaging 7,000 DM.&#13;
22.   Microcredit Methodology.  Microcredit service providers are expected to use a range of&#13;
microcredit delivery methodologies, adapting world-wide microcredit experience to the specific needs of&#13;
their target populations and to conditions and traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Service providers&#13;
targeting the smallest borrowers (loans sizes less than 1,500DM) are likely to use solidarity group&#13;
approaches. Other organizations may introduce community-based lending approaches, which may build&#13;
on the tradition of Bosnian "self-help funds" (Kase uzajamne pomoci). Under such funds, which&#13;
generally functioned within state enterprises or cooperatives, group members pooled their savings and&#13;
members would then take turns taking credit. Microcredit service providers targeting clients borrowing&#13;
in the range of 4,000-10,000 DM are likely to use individual lending methodologies, often combined&#13;
with business training and technical assistance. Under the Project, financing will be provided for&#13;
extensive training and technical advice to assist the microcredit service providers in the development and&#13;
implementation of their microcredit delivery methodologies in a manner which is both appropriate to the&#13;
borrower and which leads towards financial sustainability.&#13;
23.   Microcredit Program Selection and Implementation Process. It was agreed at negotiations that&#13;
microcredit service providers and programs would be selected in accordance with operational procedures&#13;
and criteria detailed in the Project's Operational Manual, which would be at all times acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Finalization of the Operational Manual by the FETF and RETF, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness for the Federation component and a condition of disbursement for the Republika Srpska&#13;
component. An outline of the Operational Manual is provided in Appendix 2. Microcredit programs&#13;
would be proposed by potential microcredit service providers, which would be non-Government&#13;
associations or organizations that have successful microcredit experience or, at least, an established track&#13;
record of successful delivery of other services to their proposed target population. The microcredit&#13;
service providers would either be indigenous organizations, or foreign NGOs that would agree to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Page 10 of 23&#13;
forming an independent local organization over an agreed time period to take over their microcredit&#13;
operation.&#13;
24.   It is estimated that about 12-18 NGO microcredit service providers will be selected, of which 3-5&#13;
may eventually become fully financially sustainable microcredit institutions that will continue to serve&#13;
the smallest credit clients and promote entrepreneurship over the long term. A further 4-6 may also&#13;
continue operations beyond the two-year life of the Project but will remain dependent on subsidies. The&#13;
remainder of the service providers, though fulfilling the primary objective of assisting economically&#13;
disadvantaged groups start-up microenterprises, may not continue operations beyond the life of the&#13;
Project. Given the limited number of microcredit programs to be financed, it would be agreed at&#13;
negotiations that microcredit program selections and agency agreements would require no objection by&#13;
IDA.&#13;
Component 2: Microcredit Institutional Capacity Building (US$1.5 million or 9% of total cost)&#13;
25.   Given that microcredit and microenterprise promotion is a completely new field in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, the microcredit services providers and the Local Initiatives Department will require&#13;
considerable technical assistance and training to develop successful microcredit programs that can be&#13;
sustainable over the long term. The Project includes a total of 60 months of foreign consultancies (36&#13;
months long term; 24 months short term) for which grant financing is sought. Technical assistance and&#13;
training would be provided for the Local Initiatives Department staff and for the microcredit service&#13;
providers. Specifically, the following types of technical assistance would be financed: (a) expert&#13;
microfinance advice to participating service providers; (b) development and refining of project&#13;
operational procedures; (c) setting up of project financial controls; (d) establishment of management&#13;
information systems for project monitoring and portfolio management; (e) establishment of a system for&#13;
reviewing and monitoring the business environment and providing input to government policy reform;&#13;
and (f) provision of assistance with specific microbusiness marketing or supply problems. Regular&#13;
hands-on training would also be provided for (a) project management staff; and (b) service providers in&#13;
microcredit delivery, and portfolio and financial management.&#13;
Component 3: Project Management (US$1.3 million or 7% of total cost)&#13;
26.   Financing is provided for the establishment and operational costs of the Local Initiatives&#13;
Departments in the ETFs, which would manage the Project and be responsible for selecting, supporting,&#13;
and monitoring microcredit programs. The ETFs, which have been set up in the Federation and the&#13;
Republika Srpska, also act as umbrella foundations for two other IDA-financed employment generation&#13;
projects-the Public Works and Employment Project and the Demobilization and Reintegration Project.&#13;
Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
27.   Project Costs. The total estimated cost of the project is US$18 million equivalent, net of taxes&#13;
and duties; US$12 million for the Federation and US$6 million for the Republika Srpska. Given the&#13;
short project period and the nature of the project, no physical or price contingencies have been applied-&#13;
the number of microcredit programs to be financed will vary according to total financing available. The&#13;
Project will have a two year implementation period and project financing is expected to be disbursed&#13;
over 30 months. A summary of project costs by component and by expenditure category are shown in&#13;
Tables 1 and 2 below. Detailed cost tables for the Federation and the Republika Srpska are provided in&#13;

28.     Financing Plan. Of the total project cost of US$18 million, the IDA Interim Trust Fund would&#13;
finance US$7 million (39 percent of total costs). The Italian Government has also agreed to provide 5&#13;
billion Italian lira (about US$3.3 million) as joint cofinancing. Cofinancing has also been requested&#13;
from EU-Phare (about US$3 million) and is under consideration but may not be available before mid-&#13;
1997. The remaining US$4.7 million cofinancing is being sought. During the pilot phase of the Project,&#13;
financing was provided by the Dutch Government (US$800,000) and by the UNHCR (up to US$1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

million) to start up pilot microcredit programs prior to the full-scale Project.  The financing plans by&#13;
component and by expenditure category are shown in Tables 3 and 4 below.&#13;
29.    Retroactive Financing. During negotiations, it was agreed that retroactive financing up to a&#13;
total amount of US$100,000 would be available to finance operating costs and equipment for the&#13;
Federation component (disbursement categories 3 (a) and 5 (a)) on account of payments made after&#13;
September 30, 1996 and prior to credit signing.&#13;
30.    Regarding the Interim Fund credit, credit funds will be lent to the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina&#13;
on IDA terms under an Interim Fund Development Credit Agreement. Receipt of a legal opinion that the&#13;
Interim Fund Development Credit Agreement has been duly executed and is legally binding in&#13;
accordance with its terms would be a condition of credit effectiveness. The State will on-lend the credit&#13;
to the Federation and Republika Srpska Govemments, which will make the proceeds of the credit&#13;
available to their respective ETFs on a non-reimbursable grant basis under a Subsidiary Finance and&#13;
Project Implementation Agreement, acceptable to IDA, signed by the State, the respective Entities, and&#13;
the respective ETFs. During negotiations, it was agreed that the execution of the Subsidiary Finance and&#13;
Project Implementation Agreement with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and receipt of an&#13;
opinion that the Subsidiary Finance and Project Implementation Agreement has been duly executed and&#13;
is legally binding upon the parties, would be conditions of effectiveness for the Federation component&#13;
and conditions of disbursement for the Republika Srpska component.&#13;

In addition, the Bosnian Women's Initiative, a US$5 million fund financed by the U.S. Government and&#13;
administered by UNHCR, is considering financing up to US$1 million of microenterprise related activities,&#13;
including microcredit programs, targeted towards women. Discussions have been held regarding adopting the&#13;
same operational procedures and principals for both initiatives and it is hoped that a formal agreement and close&#13;
cooperation can be reached between the two initiatives.&#13;

Economic Justification&#13;
31.    The primary objective of this Project is to promote self-employment and entrepreneurship and so&#13;
increase household incomes among the most disadvantaged segments of the population in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina by increasing the access to credit and related businesses services to the target populations.&#13;
The economic impact at the household level of the types of microcredit programs to be supported by this&#13;
Project has been proven throughout the world, including in the United States and western Europe.&#13;
Regular access to credit can help microentrepreneurs provide gainful employment for themselves and&#13;
their families. In some cases, these microentrepreneurs are able to expand their businesses beyond the&#13;
family circle and make the transition towards small and medium businesses.&#13;
32.    Under this Project, it is estimated that about 7,000-10,000 loans will be disbursed to individuals&#13;
for self-employment or to establish or expand microenterprises, creating an estimated 15,000 jobs. The&#13;
estimated cost per job created under the Project is about $1,000 per job. Given that, at present, the&#13;
unemployment benefits system has yet to be restarted in Bosnia, there is no data against which to&#13;
compare the cost effectiveness of this intervention. However, experience in other post-socialist countries&#13;
shows that the cost of microenterprise programs compare very favorably to the annual cost to&#13;
government of unemployment benefits or social assistance, not including the social costs of&#13;
unemployment.  It is expected that this project could reduce the cost of unemployment to the&#13;
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the coming years, as well as increase the tax base by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

supporting the start-up and expansion of small businesses. Overall, it can be expected that the financial&#13;
reflows to the Entity Governments will be positive.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
33.    Because it is an emergency project, the Project is not assigned an environmental category. Given&#13;
the very small scale of the microbusinesses and self-employment activities to be supported, the project is&#13;
expected to have little or no environmental impact. However, the project will be monitored during&#13;
supervision to assure that there is no degradation to the environment from the business activities&#13;
financed.&#13;
D.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
34.   Institutional Structure within Employment and Training Foundation. Local Initiatives&#13;
Departments, housed within the Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs) in the Federation and in&#13;
the RS, will be responsible for overall project management within their respective territories. Both the&#13;
Federation and RS ETFs have already been legally established as autonomous, non-profit agencies&#13;
according to a Charter acceptable to IDA, approved by the Government of the Federation on July 25,&#13;
1996 and the RS ETF (RETF) on 30 May, 1996. A model on which both these charters are based in&#13;
provided in Appendix 4. The Federation ETF was legally registered with the Ministry of Justice on&#13;
August 26, 1996 and the RS ETF on October 15, 1996. These ETFs are currently the implementing&#13;
agencies for two other IDA-financed projects-the Public Works and Employment Project and the&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Project.&#13;
35.    The organizational structure of the ETFs is depicted in Figure 1, and a more detailed diagram of&#13;
implementation arrangements is shown in Appendix 5. Each ETF has a Board of Trustees comprised of&#13;
representatives from relevant ministries and organizations, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of&#13;
Physical Planning and Environment, Ministry of Social Affairs and Refugees, Ministry of Defense,&#13;
Ministry of Labor/Employment Institutes, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Association of Trade&#13;
Unions. Board meetings are chaired by the Ministry of Finance. The Boards, which meet every three&#13;
months, are responsible for approving the regulations, policies, procedures and annual budget of the&#13;
Departments of the ETFs and for reporting to the Government on the overall implementation progress of&#13;
the projects under their management control.&#13;

36.    The Local Initiatives Departments, set up to manage the day-to-day implementation of the&#13;
Project, would be headed by an Executive Director, appointed by the respective Entity Government and&#13;
approved by the Board of Trustees. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the ETF Local&#13;
Initiatives Department will be maintained with staffing and function acceptable to IDA. Each LID will&#13;
establish a Credit Committee comprising the Project Executive Director, the Project Finance Director, a&#13;
selected (rotating) banker, a selected (rotating) member of the ETF Board of Trustees, and two selected&#13;
experts in related fields. This Credit Committee would have responsibility for approving microcredit&#13;
program proposals and agency agreements with microcredit service providers. It was agreed during&#13;
negotiations that microcredit program selections and proposed agency agreements would require IDA no&#13;
objection.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
37.    Agency Arrangement. The proposed implementation arrangement for the project is an agency&#13;
arrangement, under which microcredit service providers (primarily NGOs) would be contracted by the&#13;
Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs) to make loans to the final beneficiaries. The main reason&#13;
for adopting this model, as opposed to a financial intermediation model, is that, given the lack of prior&#13;
microcredit experience of NGOs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is not considered advisable to hand over&#13;
ownership of the project funds to NGOs at this stage. The agency model allows the ETF to maintain&#13;
control of the funds in the case of poor portfolio performance.&#13;
38.    The trade-off of adopting this model is that the credit risk, the ultimate incentive to ensure high&#13;
repayments, remains with the ETF. Given this, the project has incorporated several incentive measures&#13;
to ensure high repayment rates and increasing operational efficiency and to encourage the microcredit&#13;
service providers to move towards financial sustainability. The incentive system would work as follows:&#13;
*  the ETF would contract the microcredit service providers through performance-based agency&#13;
agreements. A model "agency agreement" would be contained in the Operational Manual,&#13;
finalization of which is a condition of effectiveness for the Federation and a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the RS component. Under this agency agreement, the microcredit service&#13;
providers will be delegated full authority to approve, authorize disbursement, and follow-up&#13;
on repayment of loans.&#13;
*  Within each agreement, performance criteria would be agreed, including criteria related to&#13;
difficulty of reaching the target population, number of loans disbursed, portfolio quality&#13;
(including repayment rates), operational efficiency and financial sustainability.  These&#13;
performance targets would reflect the institution in question and the nature and stage of&#13;
development of its operation. Given that these are start-up operations, no service provider&#13;
will be expected to reach full financial sustainability within the life of the project (the most&#13;
successful microfinance institutions normally take 3-5 years minimum to reach this stage);&#13;
however, from the outset service providers will be encouraged to aim for increasing&#13;
operational efficiency and self-sustainability.  This includes setting real positive interest&#13;
rates, based on a target of covering costs (operating costs, inflation, loan losses and cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Page 16 of 23&#13;
funds) within a reasonable period (e.g. 3-5 years). Interest rates for each program will be&#13;
agreed between the service providers and the ETF.&#13;
*  under the agency agreement, the first tranche of the approved microcredit program would be&#13;
deposited into the microcredit service provider's local "agency account" from the Special&#13;
Account. This agency account would be opened in a local commercial bank selected by the&#13;
service provider and acceptable to the ETF . In addition, the microcredit service provider&#13;
would be provided with a management fee to cover the direct operating costs of&#13;
administering the loan fund deposited into a separate bank account ("non-agency account"),&#13;
which would generally be in the same local bank. These funds would also need to be&#13;
accounted for as part of the service provider's regular reporting to the ETF.&#13;
*  at the end of the period for disbursement of the first tranche of credit funds (typically six&#13;
months), the ETF technical staff (assisted by the expatriate microcredit expert) would&#13;
evaluate the microcredit service provider's program and make an assessment of whether the&#13;
service provider had reached the agreed perfornance targets. If all perfornance targets have&#13;
been met, i.e. performance is fully satisfactory, the ETF would authorize the transfer of&#13;
100% of the interest repayments from the agency to the non-agency account as a&#13;
performance fee, with the obligation that this fee be used for the purposes of the Project In&#13;
the event that the performance targets are not fully met but performance is satisfactory, less&#13;
than 100% of the interest repayments would be awarded to the service provider. In both&#13;
instances, the next tranche of financing would be disbursed. In the event of unsatisfactory&#13;
performance, the ETF has the option of suspending the agency agreement and renegotiating&#13;
it, if it is judged that there is the potential for performance improvement or terminating the&#13;
agency agreement and reallocating the agency account funds to a new or better performing&#13;
service provider. Termination may only occur if the agency agreement has been suspended&#13;
for more than 120 days.&#13;
-  repayments by the borrowers would be made into the appropriate local agency account. It&#13;
has been agreed during appraisal, that the loan funds would remain and be revolved at the&#13;
local level under the management of the microcredit service provider, unless bad&#13;
performance justified closing the local agency account and reallocating the funds elsewhere.&#13;
*   grant financing for overhead costs (the management fee) would progressively be diminished&#13;
as the interest repayments increase and the microcredit service provider moves towards&#13;
financial sustainability.&#13;
8&#13;
The Local Initiatives Project will encompass a range of microcredit service providers, from those providing&#13;
500DM loans to refugee women to those providing 7-10,OOODM loans to small entrepreneurs. Clearly, those at&#13;
the higher end of the scale will have better prospects of reaching financial sustainability more quickly. Those&#13;
targeting hard to reach groups, where transaction costs are high and interest repayment amounts are small, will&#13;
take far longer to reach full financial sustainability, if indeed this is an attainable goal for them.&#13;
9&#13;
The conditions for loan disbursement, loan tracking, and other data collection expectations with respect to the&#13;
local banks in which the agency accounts and non-agency accounts would be held would be spelled out in a&#13;
standardized master agreement among the ETF, each microcredit service provider, and the local bank in&#13;
question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Page 17 of 23&#13;
* as a further incentive, it was also agreed during appraisal, that if a microcredit service&#13;
provider meets a certain level of operational efficiency and satisfactory progress toward&#13;
financial self-sufficiency (as per performance criteria defined in the Operational Manual),&#13;
the ETF could grant the balance of the agency account to the service provider as a&#13;
capitalization grant for future independent operations. Judgment as to whether to grant&#13;
capitalization grants to any service providers within the Project period would be made in the&#13;
final semester of the Project by the ETF and IDA.&#13;
39.   Program Cycle. The program cycle of the Local Initiatives Department (LID) would be divided&#13;
into three main stages: (a) promotions; (b) screening, appraisal, and approval; and (c) implementation.&#13;
40.   Promotions. During the first stage in the program cycle, the promotional phase, the LID will&#13;
inform potential microcredit service providers of the existence of the Local Initiatives Project, including&#13;
the guidelines and eligibility criteria for program applications. All organizations that meet the eligibility&#13;
criteria will be eligible to apply (see Appendix 6 for draft eligibility criteria).&#13;
41.   Screening, Appraisal, Approval. Program proposals submitted by potential microcredit service&#13;
providers will be screened to identify those which meet the eligibility criteria. The LID, with the&#13;
assistance of an expatriate Microfinance Specialist, will carry out a field appraisal of eligible applicants&#13;
to evaluate the appropriateness of their microcredit program proposal and the capacity of the potential&#13;
microcredit service provider to implement the proposed program. During the appraisal, a business plan&#13;
and performance targets would be discussed. In the case that a potential microcredit service provider has&#13;
limited prior experience in microcredit delivery, an intensive training course in microcredit would be&#13;
provided prior to agreeing on a final program proposal and business plan. After appraisal, the documents&#13;
would be forwarded to the designated World Bank staff person for review on a no objection basis. Once&#13;
the no objection from the World Bank is received, the LIDs would present the final program proposal to&#13;
their Credit Committee for consideration and approval.&#13;
42.   Implementation. In the third phase, implementation of approved programs commences. LID&#13;
staff negotiate and sign agency agreements with each microcredit service provider, based on agreed&#13;
business plans and performance targets. The financial and monitoring staff of the LID would work with&#13;
each approved service provider to set up fairly standardized accounting and information systems.&#13;
Throughout Project implementation, hands-on technical advice and training would be provided to the&#13;
service providers by the expatriate and local Microcredit Specialists to increase their skills and capacity&#13;
in microcredit delivery and portfolio management. Implementation of the microcredit programs will be&#13;
monitored on a monthly basis by the monitoring staff of the LID.&#13;

21 Categories are broken down by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina component and the Republika Srpska component.&#13;
The "other" category includes small loans less than 10,000 DM each (the beneficiaries of which would use their traditional&#13;
purchasing practices of comparing price quotations); management fees to service providers; consulting services to be procured&#13;
following Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants; and salaries, fees and other operating costs (travel and utilities).&#13;
44.     Procurement will be carried out by the ETF Local Initiatives Department.  It was agreed at&#13;
negotiations that the following procurement procedures will apply to project expenditures financed by&#13;
IDA (ITF):&#13;
45.    Small-Scale Credit. The IDA (ITF) credit will finance small loans less than DEM-10,000 each,&#13;
for a total amount of US$4.7 million-US$3.0 million in the Federation and US$1.7 million in the&#13;
Republika Srpska. Beneficiaries will use their purchasing practices, which usually involve comparing&#13;
more than one price quotation. The subloans will be managed by service providers, which will be&#13;
contracted by the ETFs under agency agreements. Under these agency agreements, the service providers&#13;
would also be paid management fees to cover the direct costs of administering the small-scale credits.&#13;
The contracting arrangements are described in detail in para. 38. Selection of service providers will be&#13;
sole-source, based on a competitive pre-qualification process, as described in para. 40-41.&#13;

46.   Goods and Equipment. Goods and equipment to be procured under the Project Management&#13;
component for the Local Initiatives Department of the ETF include vehicles, computers and office&#13;
equipment. Given the small size of the procurement packages, national shopping, with at least three&#13;
quotations, will be used, for an aggregate amount not to exceed US$48,000 for the Federation and&#13;
US$48,000 for the Republika Srpska. Goods and equipment may only be procured from countries that&#13;
are participating countries of the Interim Fund.&#13;
47.   Consulting Services and Training. A total of up to $275,000 in the Federation and $130,000 in&#13;
the Republika Srpska would be allocated to consultant services and training. Consultant services will be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1991). Consultants hired&#13;
to provide technical assistance will be selected based on advertising and comparison of curriculum vitae,&#13;
and only if fully justified on sole source contracting. Only consultants from countries participating in the&#13;
Interim Fund shall be eligible to provide services financed out of the Interim Fund Credit.&#13;
48.   Project Operating Costs. The IDA credit would finance the operating expenses of the ETF&#13;
Local Initiatives Departments, including salaries, utilities, office and vehicle rental, vehicle maintenance&#13;
and operating costs, and office supplies, for an aggregate amount of US$217,000 in the Federation and&#13;
US$142,000 in the RS, which would be based on annual budget and work prograrns approved by the ETF&#13;
Board and agreed with IDA.&#13;
49.   Bank Review. IDA will carry out ex post review of goods procured using national shopping&#13;
procedures. For consultant contracts, prior review would be required for (i) all consultants' terms of&#13;
reference; (ii) contracts above US$100,000 for firms; and (iii) contracts above US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals; and (iv) all sole source contracts. Consultant contracts acceptable to the Bank would be&#13;
used. Prior Bank review would also be required for foreign training and study tours.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
50.   The proposed Interim Fund credit of US$7 million is expected to be disbursed over a period of&#13;
30 months after the date of effectiveness scheduled for December 15, 1996. Anticipated IDA (ITF)&#13;
disbursements are shown in Table 7. The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1998.&#13;
The Project's Closing Date would be June 30, 1999.&#13;
51.   Disbursements under categories I (microcredit) and 2 (management fees to service providers)&#13;
would be against agency agreements signed between the ETFs and service providers. Under the termns of&#13;
these agreements, each of which will be subject to IDA no objection, the ETFs would advance funds to&#13;
the service providers, making a normal down payment to the service providers and subsequent advances&#13;
in accordance with the agency agreement.&#13;

52.   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, Special Accounts would be&#13;
established in commercial banks, acceptable to IDA, for both the Federation and the Republika Srpska,&#13;
with an authorized allocation of US$600,000 for the Federation and US$300,000 for Republika Srpska,&#13;
representing about four months of project expenditures. The day-to-day management of the Special&#13;
Accounts would be delegated by the State Ministry of Finance and the Federation and RS Ministries of&#13;
Finance to the ETFs in order to facilitate rapid project implementation. Replenishment applications&#13;
would be forwarded to the Bank by the ETF with reconciled bank statements and other appropriate&#13;
documentation.&#13;
53.   Documentation of Expenditure. Disbursements would be based on full documentation of&#13;
expenditures for the following: (a) consultant contracts over US$50,000 for individuals and over&#13;
US$100,000 for firms; (b) foreign training; and (c) study tours. Disbursements for all other expenditures&#13;
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure certified by the Executive Director of the Local&#13;
Initiatives Department. The required supporting documents would be retained by the ETF for at least&#13;
one year after the receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the disbursement was&#13;
made. This documentation would be made available for review by auditors and by visiting IDA staff&#13;
upon request.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
54.   The ETFs would be responsible for overall financial management of the project and would&#13;
establish accounting systems acceptable to IDA, with technical assistance, as required. The ETF would&#13;
be subject to annual external audits by independent auditors, satisfactory to IDA. The external auditing&#13;
firm will be responsible for auditing all project accounts, the special account, and all disbursement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Page 21 of 23&#13;
requests made against Statement of Expenditures. Each ETF shall submit project financial statements to&#13;
IDA no later than four months after the end of each fiscal year, and certified copies of the external audit&#13;
report no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year, including balance sheets, income&#13;
statements, and the auditor's opinion on whether the ETF is achieving its objectives in a cost-effective&#13;
way and whether internal controls are adequate to minimize the misuse of funds.&#13;
Supervision, Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
55.   Bank Supervision.  Due to the innovative nature of the project and the importance of&#13;
discouraging financial misallocations, intensive supervision is required by IDA. Close supervision&#13;
would be facilitated by having the Task Manager based at the Resident Mission in Sarajevo. In addition,&#13;
an estimated 3-4 supervision missions by microfinance and operations specialists, totaling 15-20 staff&#13;
weeks, would be required annually.&#13;
56.   Reporting. Microcredit service providers would report to the Local Initiatives Departments on&#13;
their portfolio and loan collections on a monthly basis, according to reporting requirements agreed with&#13;
IDA and included in the Operational Manual. The Local Initiatives Department would in turn submit&#13;
summary progress reports to IDA on a quarterly basis, according to an agreed format, summarizing the&#13;
microcredit programs under different stages of review or implementation.&#13;
57.   Mid-Term Review. It was agreed during negotiations, that a mid-term review would be carried&#13;
out jointly by IDA and the ETFs no later than December 31, 1997, (about 12 months following project&#13;
effectiveness).&#13;
58.   Monitoring. Performance monitoring indicators were agreed during negotiations (see Appendix&#13;
9) that would be used to monitor the achievement of project objectives. These indicators reflect the&#13;
objectives of employment creation and putting in place well-managed microcredit programs that have the&#13;
potential of eventually reaching sustainability. Bank supervision of the Project will closely monitor&#13;
these indicators. During the first year of project implementation, special attention will be paid to gaining&#13;
a better knowledge of the target populations, the types of activities financed, the returns on different&#13;
types of activity and the obstacles to microenterprise creation in order to adapt the credit methodologies&#13;
to the needs and constraints of the client population in question and to provide feedback to the&#13;
government authorities on how to improve the small business environment.&#13;
E.    BENEFITS AND RiSKS&#13;
59.   Project Benefits. Major immediate benefits would include (a) the promotion of about 7,000-&#13;
10,000 microenterprises or income-generating activities, which would create employment and help to&#13;
restart the economy; and (b) the strengthening of local institutions and NGOs that could provide financial&#13;
and non-financial services to the self-employed and microenterprises on a long-term basis, so playing an&#13;
important role in the reconstruction and economic transition process at the grassroots level. On a more&#13;
general level, the project would foster entrepreneurship and solidarity; and it would help the most&#13;
vulnerable groups by supporting their initiatives to become economically self-reliant. By promoting an&#13;
active employment policy, the project would help prevent long-term dependency and the excessive fiscal&#13;
and social costs related to unemployment.&#13;
10&#13;
These reports would also be transmitted to the World Bank Task Manager based in the Resident Mission.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

60.   Project Risks. There is a general risk of a resumption of hostilities in the region; it is hoped that&#13;
rapid reconstruction and economic reintegration of vulnerable groups including demobilized soldiers&#13;
through projects such as the Local Initiatives Project could help cement the peace process. The main&#13;
project-specific risks are: (i) continued Government commitment to building the capacity of non-&#13;
govermmental organizations as microcredit service providers; (ii) a "central planning" approach of the&#13;
Local Initiatives Department as regards the service providers and of the microcredit service providers&#13;
towards their clients which could hinder appropriate loan delivery; (iii) lack of institutional capacity&#13;
among microcredit service providers which could result in poor portfolio performance, particularly low&#13;
repayment rates, and (iv) political interference in program selection or loan distribution. The first risk&#13;
will be addressed by working closely with the Government to raise their awareness as to the role of non-&#13;
bank financial institutions in providing credit and related services to microentrepreneurs:. The second&#13;
two risks will be addressed by encouraging an approach in which borrowers perceive loans as their own&#13;
private sector activity and service providers are given the incentives to act as fully responsible agents.&#13;
Microcredit service providers and the Local Initiatives Departments will be provided hands-on technical&#13;
support and training in microcredit delivery and a market-oriented approach to microenterprise&#13;
development. Service providers will also receive training in portfolio and financial management and&#13;
assistance in putting in place systems and procedures for ensuring on-time loan repayments. The risk of&#13;
political interference will be limited by applying standard operational procedures and program selection&#13;
criteria to assure transparency, and establishing a Credit Committee responsible for program approval&#13;
that represents a broad participation and a range of expertise.&#13;
F.    AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED&#13;
61.    The following agreements were reached during negotiations:&#13;
(a) Microcredit programs will be selected according to criteria and procedures defined in an&#13;

PILOT PROJECT EXPERIENCE&#13;
TUZLA PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
I.    In February, 1996, the World Bank initiated a pilot microcredit project in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina. The main objectives of the pilot project were to: (i) assess the needs and constraints of the&#13;
target populations, (ii) experiment with microcredit delivery methods, and (iii) test implementing&#13;
arrangements for microcredit delivery. The pilot project was initiated in the canton of Tuzia using grant&#13;
financing from the Netherlands Government. Tuzla was chosen as the area for the pilot project because&#13;
it was the first cantonal administration to be organized in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has one of the&#13;
highest number of displaced people (250,000 displaced people for a current local population of 420,000),&#13;
as well as a substantial number of "social cases" (war-affected population dependent on humanitarian&#13;
assistance) which were potential beneficiaries of the pilot project, and because there are substantial&#13;
number of NGOs operating out of Tuzla who represented potential implementing partners.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.    A Steering Committee was established to select pilot subprojects for financing. The Steering&#13;
Committee was chaired by the Minister of Reconstruction, Development and Enterprise for Tuzla&#13;
canton, and comprised representatives of the Tuzla Agency for Local Development Initiatives (TALDI),&#13;
the Tuzla Commercial Bank, UNHCR and the World Bank.&#13;
3.    TALDI, which was created at the end of 1995 as a non-profit organization, was appointed to act&#13;
as the secretariat for the Steering Committee, monitor the subprojects in liaison with UNHCR and assure&#13;
that reporting requirements stipulated in the subproject contracts were fulfilled.&#13;
4.    NGOs and local associations were invited to propose subprojects to be implemented under the&#13;
pilot project.&#13;
Projects Selected&#13;
5.    Three subprojects were selected, each of them focusing on a different segment of the target&#13;
population. Through these pilot subprojects, the aim was to learn about the credit terms and conditions&#13;
and credit delivery methodologies, as well as the complementary support, best adapted to the specific&#13;
needs of each segment of the target population.&#13;
(a) BOSPO: Small Businesses for Displaced Women&#13;
6.    Subproiect Description. The objective of the subproject is to assist displaced women, many of&#13;
whom come from rural backgrounds, in creating income generating activities through: (i) small loans&#13;
(DM 500-1,500), (ii) simple business training, and (iii) group support.&#13;
7.    As of September 30, 1996, 103 loans have been disbursed, 95 % of which to women, totaling&#13;
DM 51,500. The majority of loans are for DM 500, with 6-8 months repayment periods and 1-4 months&#13;
grace periods depending on the activity financed. The rate of interest charged is 10% per year on a flat&#13;
basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX I&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
8.     The activities financed mainly  correspond to the traditional skills of the rural women: (i)&#13;
agriculture and livestock (renting of land and purchase of inputs for vegetable production, purchase of a&#13;
cow or a few goats), (ii) the skills learned or up-graded in occupational therapy courses (sewing,&#13;
knitting, carpet making, hair dressing).&#13;
9.     SubDroject Evaluation. The subproject has revealed the relatively high demand for credit of&#13;
displaced women and their good market and risk analysis (most are interested in trade activities). The&#13;
main problems to be solved are: (i) the lack of experience of the staff in project analysis, which results in&#13;
repayment periods incompatible with some types of activities (e.g. livestock) and in oversophisticated&#13;
business plans relative to the small loan amounts; (ii) the lack of experience in portfolio and financial&#13;
management; (iii) too wide a geographical coverage (21 centers in 6 municipalities) for such an early&#13;
stage of the program and BOSPO's institutional capacity.&#13;
10.    Following training and technical support organized by the World Bank, it has been agreed that&#13;
BOSPO will: (i) scale down the geographical coverage of their program; (ii) improve the follow-up of&#13;
repayments of existing loans; (iii) set up a methodology based on the solidarity group approach for new&#13;
loans; (iii) refine loan terms and conditions; and (iv) set-up better accounting and financial management&#13;
systems. The World Bank will provide further technical assistance to BOSPO in order to achieve these&#13;
steps.&#13;
(b) International Rescue Committee: Village Credit Funds)&#13;
11.    Subproiect Descriotion.  Before the war, small-scale credit to private farmers was available&#13;
through cooperatives. These cooperatives collapsed during the war so ending the availability of credit in&#13;
rural areas. The objective of this subproject was to experiment with delivery of small-scale credit in&#13;
rural areas for agriculture as well as off-farm activities, drawing on the tradition of the self-help funds&#13;
that existing in cooperatives. Two revolving credit funds for financing income generating activities have&#13;
been established in two villages - Babunovici (Srebrenik Municipality) and Kraljevici (lvornik&#13;
Municipality).&#13;
12.    As of September 30, 1996, 35 loans have been disbursed totaling 68,500 DM, 15% of which to&#13;
women. The loan sizes range from DM 1,500-2,000. Repayment period varies from 6 month for trade to&#13;
up to 18 months for livestock and agriculture, with the possibility of 1-2 months grace period. The rate&#13;
of interest charged is 12 % per year, on a declining basis. The overall repayment rate, to date, is 97%.&#13;
13.    Activities financed include: (i) agriculture and livestock activities, (ii) services ( tailor,&#13;
electrician, hairdresser, glass cutter etc.), and (iii) small-scale production (furniture, sugar cubes etc.)&#13;
14.    Subproject Evaluation. While IRC was able to better organize individual project analysis and&#13;
overall portfolio management, the main problem with their program is the relatively long time needed to&#13;
organize a Village Credit Association, which according to the "Law on Citizens' Associations", requires&#13;
at least 30 members. It seems also that the methodology used by IRC, combining aspects of individual&#13;
lending, solidarity group lending and lending to a community-based organization (CBO) could be&#13;
simplified, although the Association members are satisfied with the approach and strongly desire to&#13;
maintain small solidarity groups as well as their overarching Association.&#13;
15.    Following the training and technical support provided by the World Bank, it has been agreed&#13;
that: (i) the possibility of using solidarity group member guarantees, dividing the risk equally between&#13;
the group members, will replace the present method whereby each loan is guaranteed for its total amount&#13;
by two guarantors; b) a model based on the CBO methodology (and possibly the solidarity group&#13;
methodology) will be tested separately in one or two other villages.&#13;
&#13;

(c) World Vision and Association of Demobilized Soldiers (DM 179 768)&#13;
16.   Su4proect Description  The objective of this subproject was to work out a methodology for&#13;
urban microenterprise development, targeted primarily towards demobilized soldiers, by providing: (i)&#13;
practical training in accounting, business registration and tax policy, management, marketing and&#13;
business plan preparation, (ii) small loans averaging DM 7, 000, and (iii) on-going technical assistance to&#13;
the selected microentrepreneurs.&#13;
17.   As of September 30, 1996, about 50 microentrepreneurs  have been trained, of which 22&#13;
microentrepreneurs have received loans, totaling 139,000 DM. Loan sizes range between 3,000-10,000&#13;
DM with repayment periods ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Interest rates are 15% per annum for trade&#13;
and 17% per annum for production, calculated on a flat basis. The repayment rate, to date, is 100%. The&#13;
training fee is 1% of the loan amount for those who receive loans.&#13;
18.   The activities fall mainly in the category of small-scale production related to reconstruction&#13;
activities (woodwork, paint, decorative concrete, brick, wood and metal products etc.), services (car&#13;
washing, glass workshop, graphic art, transport etc.) and trade (clothing, food, import/export).&#13;
19.   Sub4rqiect Evaluation  The subproject addresses the easiest target population, since a large&#13;
number of the microentrepreneurs operated their businesses before the war. The loans have permitted&#13;
the creation of 64 news jobs, the majority of them for demobilized soldiers. The methodology based on&#13;
individual lending seems appropriate for this category of the target population. The preliminary training&#13;
and the on-going technical assistance play an important part in the program and seem essential to its&#13;
success.&#13;
UNHCR-FINANCED PILOT PROJECTS&#13;
20.   On August 1, 1996, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the UNHCR&#13;
and the World Bank. Under this MoU, UNHCR and the WB agreed to jointly promote a UNHCR-&#13;
financed microcredit pilot program to expand the experience in Tuzla and precede and partly overlap&#13;
with the WB-financed Local Initiatives Project. The total amount of the subprojects financed will -not&#13;
exceed US$ 1 million. The microcredit programs are targeted towards returnees and war affected&#13;
persons, UNHCR being responsible for designating priority geographical areas and financing the&#13;
subprojects selected, while the WB is responsible for preparing technical guidelines and providing&#13;
training and technical support to the microcredit service providers.&#13;
21.   As agreed in the MoU, in August 1996, the WB organized an initial training course for NGOs&#13;
selected jointly with UNHCR and assisted them in designing programs for start-up microcreditprograms&#13;
to be financed by UNHCR for the period September-December. The four NGOs selected as microcredit&#13;
service providers in the Federation are:&#13;
Agency for Local Development Initiatives (ALDI), Gorazde&#13;
22.   Registered in June 1996, ALDI is a local association of 60 private business people and local&#13;
citizens whose primary aim is to involve local citizens in the reconstruction and economic recovery of&#13;
Gorazde. Though just recently organized in its present form, this association operated during the war to&#13;
support citizens through the long isolation of the town. ALDI's pilot microcredit program is targeted&#13;
towards microentrepreneurs in Gorazde, primarily those who have prior business experience. They plan&#13;
to disburse about 12 loans between DM 5-10 000 by end December 1996 for equipment and working&#13;
capital, using an individual lending methodology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

La Benevolencija, Sarajevo&#13;
23.   La Benevolencija is a Bosnian cultural and humanitarian organization that dates back to 1892,&#13;
reopening with the elections in 1991, after closure during the socialist years. La Benevolencija operates&#13;
a medical and an educational program and will start a business training program in October 1996 with&#13;
external technical assistance. Under the UNHCR/WB Project, Benevolencija intends to disburse 30 to 50&#13;
loans in the range of DM 3,000 to 10,000, using individual lending methodology. Their primary target&#13;
group is urban microentrepreneurs, preferably with some previous business experience.&#13;
Plavimost, Bihac&#13;
24.   Plavimost became an independent local NGO in July 1996, following two years as a project of&#13;
CARE, Canada. Their current focus is a humanitarian one, serving about 5000 people in Bihac and&#13;
surrounding areas. Plavimost has chosen the solidarity group methodology to make a projected 60 loans&#13;
by end December 1996 of DM 1,500 and less to a target population consisting primarily of women.&#13;
Vrelo, Mostar&#13;
25.   Vrelo registered as a local NGO on August 5, 1996 with the intention of taking over the activities&#13;
of ASB a Swiss NGO, focusing mainly on humanitarian assistance and operating centers for refugee&#13;
women in Mostar, Blagdi and Vrapcici. These centers provide training in typing, sewing and knitting.&#13;
Their microcredit program will be targeted towards women using the solidarity group methodology and&#13;
disbursing loans from DM 500 to 1000. The projected number of loans is 80.&#13;

PERFORMANCE MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
PERFORMANCE MONITORING OF MICROCREDIT SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
Each Microcredit Service Provider (MCSP) will negotiate its own performance targets with the&#13;
Local Initiatives Department. These will be included in the Agency Agreement and will be the basis on&#13;
which LID disburses additional tranches of loan funds and management fees, and calculates performance&#13;
fees. The LID expects to see positive trends and increasing performance over time within each MCSP.&#13;
The following performance criteria will be applied to each MCSP. Each of the following indicators will&#13;
be calculated for each period of performance review.&#13;
Outreach&#13;
Number and Percentage of loans made to each category of the target population&#13;
Scale of Operations&#13;
Number of loans disbursed&#13;
Amount of loan disbursements&#13;
Portfolio Quality&#13;
* Repayment Rate: Loan Principle Received compared to Loan Principle Due and Past Due&#13;
* Portfolio at Risk: Value of Outstanding Loans in Arrears compared to the Value of the&#13;
Outstanding Portfolio Net of Loans in Grace Period&#13;
* Loan Losses: Value of Loan Losses compared to the Average Outstanding Portfolio Net of&#13;
Loans in Grace Period&#13;
Operating Efficiency&#13;
* Operating Margin: Operating Costs compared to the Average Outstanding Portfolio&#13;
* Credit Officer Caseload: Number of Active Borrowers per Credit Officer, or Number of&#13;
Active Borrowers compared to the Number of Credit Officers&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
* Financial Self-Sufficiency: Interest Income compared to Total Costs (Operating, Loan Loss&#13;
Provision, Cost of Funds and Cost of Inflation)&#13;
PERFORMANCE MONITORING OF LOCAL INITIATIVES DEPARTMENT&#13;
The World Bank will monitor the performance of the Local Initiatives Department in relation to&#13;
the objectives of the project as follows:&#13;
Microcredit Delivery. In order to measure the disbursement of loans for income generating&#13;
activities and microenterprises - the aggregate performance of the MCSPs regarding outreach and scale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
of operations will be measured as per the above performance criteria. In addition, the LID will monitor&#13;
the total number of income-generating/microenterprises supported, and the number ofjobs supported.&#13;
Microfinance Institutional Capacity Building. In order to measure the objective of building&#13;
the capacity of institutions to deliver credit to microenterprises, the aggregate performance of the MCSPs&#13;
regarding portfolio quality, operational efficiency and financial sustainability will be measured as per the&#13;
above performance criteria. In addition, the types and number of technical assistance and training&#13;
sessions provided by the LID to the MSCPs will be monitored.&#13;

            The Local Initiatives Project's
            primary objective is to assist groups in Bosnia &amp;
            Herzegovina to restart economic activities and make the
            transition from dependence on humanitarian assistance to
            active employment. The project's secondary objectives
            are to jump start the establishment of financially viable
            microcredit institutions, to provide feedback to the
            Government and support business environment improvement. The
            project will consist of the following components: a)
            microcredit programs; b) microfinance capacity building; and
            c) project management.
