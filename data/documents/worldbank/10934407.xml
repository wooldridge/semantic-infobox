&#13;
The primary goal of the World Bank Institute Governance, Regulation and Finance unit's (WBIGF)&#13;
governance program is to help countries to develop effective programs to improve the governance of their&#13;
public institutions, as well as capacity-building and efficiency in public sector performance and service&#13;
delivery. This strategy is undertaken with the cooperation of members of the World Bank Group,&#13;
governments, civil society and other donors. Underlying the interrelated programs is the notion that a&#13;
functioning public sector should have a client-focus and service-delivery orientation, foster an open,&#13;
competitive, and transparent business environment, and maintain enhanced levels of accountability and&#13;
transparency.&#13;
&#13;
WBIGF initiated this pilot core course as part of its governance program that helps countries fight&#13;
corruption worldwide. The design was based on developing a holistic strategy that emphasized an&#13;
inclusive and participatory approach in developing and implementing anticorruption programs. The course&#13;
was divided into three interlinked phases:&#13;
&#13;
1) Phase one (June 14-18, 1999) of the course was convened in Washington, D.C., in a face-to-face&#13;
learning environment. A diverse group of stakeholders including government officials, independent&#13;
commissions, civil society and media from Benin Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda&#13;
attended. In this phase, the participants were provided with the general outline of the anticorruption&#13;
strategy, as well as the first important steps in the design and implementation of the action plan.&#13;
&#13;
2) The second phase (June 21­September 30, 1999), on which this report focuses, was delivered by&#13;
distance learning (DL) techniques in 13 weekly modules to 7 sites in Africa: Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana,&#13;
Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda. The course delivery was primarily through biweekly video&#13;
conference sessions (all sites were linked together), and was complemented by printed materials&#13;
distributed through on-site facilitators. Building on the initial action plan developed in phase one, phase two&#13;
of the course described how to go from areas of prioritization to concrete institutional reforms.&#13;
&#13;
3) The goal of phase three (October 10-15, 1999) was to capture participants' experience and to motivate&#13;
them to participate actively throughout the course. This was offered as a face-to-face event in Durban,&#13;
South Africa. In this last phase, participants presented the action programs they developed during the&#13;
course at the 9th International Anti-Corruption Conference held in Durban.&#13;
&#13;
The pilot DL portion (second phase) of the course had a total of 40 participants enrolled. Target countries&#13;
were selected based on their willingness to have a participatory program to fight corruption. The video&#13;
conferences originated in Washington, linking all sites, and were broadcast to the seven sites in Africa,&#13;
each of which had a facilitator to lead off-line discussions. Participants interacted with instructors during&#13;
video conference sessions and via e-mail and fax.&#13;
&#13;
An end-of-course, level one evaluation questionnaire was used to evaluate the program. Questionnaires&#13;
were returned from the mission offices in: Benin, Ethiopia Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, but not&#13;
from Kenya since that country lost transmissions during most of the course. Of the 40 participants from the&#13;
six countries who responded, 20 completed the questionnaire ­ a response rate of 50 percent. A 5-point&#13;
Likert type scale that ranged from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree) was utilized for the majority of the questions.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very high), with a score of 3 being an adequate rating,&#13;
was also used to rate the respondents' level of knowledge on various course topics before and after the&#13;
course. Summaries of the major evaluation findings follow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Closed-Ended Responses&#13;
&#13;
   ·    The mean scores for the course performance indicators such as relevance and usefulness were&#13;
        mostly consistent, as all had means greater than 4. The highest mean score (4.6, 100% giving a&#13;
        rating of 4 or 5) was given to the relevance of the course to the respondents' current work or&#13;
        functions. Additionally, the information acquired by the respondents which they stated as being&#13;
        useful was high (mean=4.5, 85% rating a 4 or 5). These data suggest that the respondents&#13;
        considered the course's relevance and usefulness as its primary strengths.&#13;
   ·    The course was noted for its ability in improving partnerships with key participants. Respondents&#13;
        stated that the course strengthened their partnerships both with the World Bank and with other&#13;
        course participants (both had means of 4.3, with 75% and 80% giving a rating of 4 or 5,&#13;
        respectively).&#13;
   ·    Respondents varied in their ratings on the course's adaptability. Although the ratings were high for&#13;
        the solutions being adaptable to controlling corruption in their countries (mean=4.1, 80% rating a 4&#13;
        or 5), the adaptability of the policies discussed in the course were not rated highly (mean=3.7,&#13;
        65% rating a 4 or 5). This suggests that the course offered better solutions than policies for the&#13;
        respondents' future efforts in controlling corruption in their countries.&#13;
   ·    Increases in the respondents' knowledge about other countries' efforts in combating corruption&#13;
        were limited. The respondents stated that the course was not effective in increasing their&#13;
        knowledge of policies that have worked well in other countries (mean=3.8, 50% rating a 4 or 5).&#13;
        These responses indicate that policies from other countries need to be expanded and better&#13;
        explained at the local level for this course. The course managers should address this concern for&#13;
        future courses.&#13;
   ·    Participants self-assessed their knowledge gain in relevant course topics both before and after the&#13;
        course. Overall, the course was rated as moderately successful in increasing the respondents'&#13;
        knowledge of these topics. The largest increase in knowledge (a mean gain of 1.35) was given to&#13;
        the topic of financial management and procurement (before course mean=2.9, after course&#13;
        mean=4.25). The smallest mean gain in knowledge (+1.0) was given to the respondents'&#13;
        knowledge of rule of law(mean before course=3.21, after course=4.21). The respondents also&#13;
        noted that their knowledge of other topics such as: customs reform (mean gain of 1.05); civil&#13;
        service reform (mean gain of 1.25); and issues for controlling corruption (mean gain of 1.15) also&#13;
        were increased during the course. These are not uniformly high self-reported mean gains, but do&#13;
        show that the course had, from the respondents' vantage point, generally improved their&#13;
        knowledge in relevant course topics.&#13;
   ·    According to the respondents, the content of the course matched its objectives (mean=4.2, 79%&#13;
        rating it a 4 or 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DL and Delivery Aspects of the Activity&#13;
&#13;
   ·    The course received high ratings in most areas for its delivery and distance learning (DL) aspects.&#13;
        The highest mean rating (4.5, 85% rating a 4 or 5) was given to the video conferencing technology&#13;
        as being effective. This is regarded as a positive reaction to the DL aspects of the course. The&#13;
        course materials were also rated as being well prepared by the respondents (mean=4.4, 90%&#13;
        rating a 4 or 5).&#13;
   ·    Both the pace of the course and time allotted to ask questions were rated lower. The pace of the&#13;
        presentations being appropriate was rated with a mean of 3.9, even though 75% rated it with a&#13;
        score of 4or 5. There appears to have been limited time to ask questions during the course. The&#13;
        respondents' rating of this topic had a mean of 4.0, but only 74% rated it a 4 or 5, suggesting that&#13;
        there was not enough time to pose questions during the course. Additionally, the adequacy of time&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      allowed to participate in the discussions (mean=4.0, 79% rating a 4 or 5) was rated as average.&#13;
      These ratings suggest that the course managers and the DL Unit should work together more&#13;
      closely to improve the pace of the course and to increase both the amount of time allowed to ask&#13;
      questions and for active participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Open-Ended Responses&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Respondents were asked two questions on course improvement: How the course could be more&#13;
      effective in the future; and how the distance learning aspects could be improved. Their responses&#13;
      were diverse. For the first question, there were 10 respondents (total percentages may add to&#13;
      more than 100% because many respondents offered more than one suggestion). The most&#13;
      common response (7 respondents) to the first question on course improvement was that there&#13;
      should be more practical issues and identification of key problem areas on corruption for the&#13;
      course topics. Three respondents mentioned that the course should have emphasized how they&#13;
      could remain in contact for follow-ups, for networking and for implementation of actions. An&#13;
      additional three respondents stated that a summary of best practices for other countries was&#13;
      needed.&#13;
  ·   Seven respondents offered suggestions on how to improve the DL aspects of the course, although&#13;
      some of their suggestions were not entirely related to the DL course features. Five respondents&#13;
      stated that course materials needed to be delivered in advance. Shortening the delivery time of the&#13;
      course was a suggestion made by three respondents, who said that the course was too lengthy&#13;
      and should be shortened to about 2.5 to 3 hours per day. Two respondents stated that more&#13;
      partnerships and networking with other institutions were vital to continue the learning process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Overall, the course received high ratings in many areas. The findings suggest that the relevance&#13;
      and usefulness of the course were its most positive features. Although the respondents noted that&#13;
      the course was valued for its ability in improving partnerships, the open-ended questions suggest&#13;
      that the respondents would like to maintain and broaden these partnerships so that an exchange&#13;
      of ideas and experiences will be sustained. In this sense, the respondents said that the course&#13;
      could have offered more suggestions and ways on how they could continue to build on this&#13;
      networking.&#13;
  ·   Respondents varied in their ratings on the course's adaptability. The solutions provided in the&#13;
      course were considered to be adaptable to the respondents' countries, but the policies mentioned&#13;
      in the course were considered to be less adaptable. This suggests that the policies discussed in&#13;
      the course should be more realistic and applicable to the country-specific situations which face the&#13;
      respondents.&#13;
  ·   A self-assessment of the respondents' knowledge of the major course topics showed a general,&#13;
      but not overwhelming, gain. This is indicative of a general improvement in knowledge which will&#13;
      hopefully be improved in future courses.&#13;
  ·   Additional DL questions should have been posed in the evaluation questionnaire, but WBI's&#13;
      Evaluation Unit did not have the opportunity to analyze the final evaluation questionnaire before it&#13;
      was utilized in the course. The respondents, however, did indicate that they thought the video&#13;
      conferencing technology was effective. This suggests that the major DL delivery method was&#13;
      greeted positively and implies that it is being accepted as a means of course delivery. It should be&#13;
      noted, though, that transmission difficulties occurred frequently in Kenya, which limited the course&#13;
      delivery time to that country. In fact, Kenya missed most of the course due to DL technical&#13;
      difficulties. This is one DL aspect which needs to be investigated more thoroughly so that the&#13;
      problem does not arise again in that country.&#13;
