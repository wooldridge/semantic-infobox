1. COUNTRY AND URBAN TRANSPORT BACKGROUND&#13;
COUNTRY ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1   Turkmenistan, the southernmost republic of the former Soveit Union, is bordered&#13;
to the west by the Caspian Sea, to the south by Iran and Afghanistan, to the east by&#13;
Tajikistan and to the north and northeast by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The country&#13;
gained its independence on October 27, 1991. Turkmenistan lies in the midst of two of&#13;
the largest deserts in the world, the Karakum and Kyzyl Kum, and 90% of its land is&#13;
considered arid. With an area of 488,000 kin2, it is the fourth largest country of the&#13;
Former Soviet Union republics (FSU).&#13;
1.2   Turkmenistan is one of the least urbanized of the FSU countries with 45% of the&#13;
total population in urban areas. The country's small population of 4.5 million people is&#13;
concentrated in a thin strip of land along the foothills of the South and in areas where the&#13;
land is irrigated. The nation's capital, Ashghabat, is the largest urban center with an&#13;
estimated population of 500,000.  Compared to other countries of the FSU,&#13;
Turkmenistan7s health indicators are poor. Life expectancy is the lowest (63 for males&#13;
and 70 for females); the infant mortality rate (IMR) is the highest (46/1,000); maternal&#13;
mortality is the fifth highest; rates of cardiovascular dieseases are extremely high and&#13;
increasing; and respiratory, digestive, infectious and parasitic diesease are also among the&#13;
highest of any FSU countries.&#13;
1.3   Turkmenistan's economy is dominated by energy and agriculture. It has 1.3&#13;
trillion cubic meters of proven and probable natural gas reserves and is the world's fourth&#13;
largest natural gas producer. It also has 1.1 billion tons of oil reserves. Despite these&#13;
energy reserves, the economy is still predominantly agricultural.&#13;
THE URBAN SETTING&#13;
1.4   The urban population, estimated at 1.9 million in 1994, accounts for about 45% of&#13;
the total population compared to a range of 40% to 75% in FSU and 30% to 60% in the&#13;
Central Asia subregion of the FSU. However, the rate of growth in the urban population&#13;
has been particularly high since 1990, reflecting the increasing liberalization of economic&#13;
activity, the mobility of labor, and the relatively strong growth of the service sector in&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
1.5   Ashghabat, the nation's capital, is the largest urban center with an estimated&#13;
population of 500,000. Since 1991, the Government has devoted much of its development&#13;
budget to upgrading the city's commercial and administrative infrastructure. This&#13;
expenditure has underpinned both a substantial growth in construction and commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                    Chapter I&#13;
activity and contributed to the rapid growth of eight per cent per annum in the city's&#13;
population in the last five years.&#13;
1.6   The other major urban centers in the country are Chardjou (population of&#13;
180,000), Mary (population of 167,000), Dashkovuz (population of 140,000), Nebitag&#13;
(population of 109,000) and Turkmenbashi (population of 64,000). In aggregate, the&#13;
population of these towns has been stagnant since 1991.&#13;
1.7   With the exception of Ashghabat, the major urban centers are the administrative&#13;
centers for the country's five local governments (velayats). Ashghabat, as the capital city,&#13;
has velayat status. Funding for local services and infrastructure provided by the urban&#13;
centers is derived predominantly from the central government through a system of&#13;
revenue-sharing of centrally administered taxes (Value-Added Tax, income taxes and&#13;
natural resources tax) and subventions from the central government. The revenue-sharing&#13;
rates and the level of subventions are determined annually. Velayats can levy their own&#13;
taxes and user fees and can borrow to finance services and investments. All local&#13;
government budgets are subject to approval by the central government, giving it a&#13;
primary role in determining the level and composition of urban services.&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT IN TURKMENISTAN&#13;
1.8   The total passenger vehicle population of Turkmenistan is estimated at 50,000&#13;
units. Detailed vehicle statistics are only available for Ashghabat, which is estimated to&#13;
account for over 40% of the national public transport vehicle population, of which 90%&#13;
are cars. In terms of ownership and use, about 70% of the car fleet is privately owned&#13;
with the balance owned by enterprises or operated as public taxis. In contrast, only about&#13;
ten percent of the bus and minivan fleet is owned privately, with the rest held by&#13;
enterprises for transport of their workforces or operated by the public transport enterprise.&#13;
Although private car ownership in Ashghabat has grown rapidly over the last five years,&#13;
the car population, at 25 units per 1000 population or 200 units per square km, is still&#13;
very small in comparison with other middle income countries.&#13;
1.9   The relatively small private car population has left a large role for public transport&#13;
in meeting mobility needs in urban centers. A detailed survey of passenger transport use&#13;
in Ashghabat indicates that about 55% of the city's population relies exclusively on&#13;
public transport for work and social trips compared to 20% that depend exclusively on the&#13;
use of private cars or enterprise transport.  Given significantly lower private car&#13;
ownership rates, the degree of dependence on public transport is probably substantially&#13;
greater in the rest of the country.&#13;
1.10        Public transport in the urban areas is provided predominantly by a fleet of&#13;
2,000 diesel and gasoline buses operated by municipally owned enterprises managed by&#13;
the Ministry of Autotransport (MoAT). The distribution, age profile and availability of&#13;
the bus fleet by urban area is summarized in Table 1.1 below.&#13;

1.11   The diesel and gasoline bus fleet in Ashghabat is supplemented by a fleet of 63&#13;
electric trolleybuses operated and managed by a municipally-owned enterprise. The&#13;
recent availability of this fleet is about 70%.&#13;
1.12  By international standards, the publicly-managed bus fleet is of adequate size in&#13;
relation to the population in all urban centers. However, the low availability of the&#13;
vehicles has eroded the capacity of the enterprises to provide an adequate and consistent&#13;
level and quality of service in most areas. The main causes of the present low availability&#13;
of the fleet are: (i) lack of resources for timely maintenance of vehicles; (ii) low vehicle&#13;
replacement rates in relation to the operating entities vehicle retirement criteria; and (iii)&#13;
the incentive these two factors provide to bus operators to both defer maintenance and&#13;
cannibalise the older vehicles in the fleet to maintain the progressively dwindling stock of&#13;
newer operable buses. The causes of low availability rates result from the inadequate&#13;
cash generation of public transport enterprises arising from the nature of their&#13;
organization and regulation and inadequate budgetary funding to compensate for their&#13;
losses.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.13   The Ministry of Autotransport (MoAT) is vested with responsibility for urban&#13;
transport planning and regulation.  The Ministry also has the responsibility for&#13;
management of inter-city bus, urban bus and intercity and urban cargo transport&#13;
operations.   These  operations  are  conducted  through  chartered  (commercially&#13;
autonomous) enterprises. MoAT staff have executive responsibility for the enterprises'&#13;
performance, overall investment planning and financing, budgeting, route scheduling,&#13;
operational management, and licensing. Fares for passenger transport are set on a&#13;
national basis by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOF) based on submissions by&#13;
the MoAT. Fares on trolleybus system are also set by central Government at the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                     Chapter I&#13;
level as diesel bus operations and the city government finances all operating subsidies.&#13;
Investments for system expansion are the responsibility of the central government.&#13;
1.14 At the municipal level, the city governments are responsible for setting bus routes&#13;
and service levels, constructing and maintaining stops, overseeing service quality and&#13;
financing losses incurred by the MoAT's municipal public passenger transport&#13;
operations. The financing needs of urban bus transport operations are established&#13;
annually in advance through an operational budgeting exercise. The operational budgets&#13;
provide for bus replacement financing needs through depreciation charges while the&#13;
financing of system expansion is the responsibility of the central government.&#13;
Investments for expansion of municipal bus systems are established under the state's&#13;
annual development budget.&#13;
1.15  The municipalities are also responsible, in principle, for overall planning of land&#13;
use and infrastructural facilities (roads, traffic, utilities, etc), the preparation of master&#13;
plans for the future investments in urban infrastructure and services, scheduling, and&#13;
coordination of all public transport services and road maintenance. In practice, only&#13;
Ashghabat has developed the institutions (Agency for Roads Management and&#13;
Department of Planning and Architecture) to perform  these services.   Other&#13;
municipalities have effectively redelegated these responsibilities to the central&#13;
government.&#13;
1.16  The licensing of private passenger transport operators in all municipalities is&#13;
currently the responsibility of the MoAT. The fares charged by private urban passenger&#13;
transport operators were decontrolled with effect from December, 1995.&#13;
1.17 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for the formulation and implementation of&#13;
traffic laws in all urban areas. The Ministry is also responsible for the operation of traffic&#13;
signals and road safety in all cities.&#13;
1.18  The prevailing institutional arrangements for the delivery of urban public&#13;
transport services have a number of serious shortcomings:&#13;
(a)   Fragmentation of Responsibilities. The division of responsibility for the&#13;
operational and financial performance of the bus systems increases the&#13;
complexity  of managing  such  systems.   More importantly, the&#13;
fragmentation of responsibilities for the systems has diffused&#13;
accountability for their performance. While municipalities have&#13;
responsibility for any residual financing requirements of the system, they&#13;
have neither the powers nor the capacity to exercise effective oversight of&#13;
the MoAT's operational management. Similarly, the MoAT is compelled&#13;
to continue to provide services irrespective of the payment of subsidy&#13;
obligations by the cities. In practice, the municipalities have abdicated&#13;
most responsibility for oversight of the bus system for two reasons: (i)&#13;
owing to staffing constraints, they have been unable to assess and thus&#13;
control the efficiency with which bus services are provided; and (b) they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                5&#13;
have not been able to finance the full recurrent subsidies required by the&#13;
bus systems, at current efficiency levels, to operate at agreed service&#13;
levels. In Ashghabat, there is no effective formal mechanism for co-&#13;
ordination of the operations and investment planning for the bus and&#13;
trolleybus systems. Most of the co-ordination of the services operations is&#13;
currently based on informal but strong ties between the management of the&#13;
systems;&#13;
(b)   Commingling of Regulatory and Functional Roles. The regulatory and&#13;
policy roles of the MoAT are commingled with its direct operating&#13;
responsibilities for the dominant segment of urban passenger transport.&#13;
This creates potential conflicts of interest in the development of&#13;
appropriate public policy and, given the limited staff of MoAT, serves to&#13;
dilute its effectiveness in both operational management and policy&#13;
making;&#13;
(c)   Inadequate Incentives for Monitoring of Performance Standards. Under&#13;
the present institutional arrangements, the regulating and supervisory&#13;
agencies (MoAT, the municipalities and the MOF) bear little of the&#13;
financial burden arising from their decisions. At the same time, public&#13;
transport operators are not held accountable for defined standards of&#13;
operating efficiency.   This absence of mutual accountability for&#13;
performance has fostered a climate of poor performance;&#13;
(d)   Difusion of Management Capability. The MoAT has a number of diverse&#13;
operating responsibilities. Its operation of urban taxi services is peripheral&#13;
to the main public objective of providing mass transport services and&#13;
results in diverting both managerial and public investment resources from&#13;
the provision of bus services, used by a majority of the population. Its&#13;
extensive involvement in inter-urban bus and cargo services as well as&#13;
intra-urban cargo services further stretches its capacity; and&#13;
(e)   Erosion of Financial Performance. The operating subsidy requirements of&#13;
public transport has grown substantially since 1991 as fares have been&#13;
subject to tight regulatory restraint, while operating costs, particularly&#13;
spare parts, have increased significantly. Cost increases have taken place&#13;
as traditional managed trade relations between the COMECON countries&#13;
and the FSU, and within the FSU, have been replaced by market-based&#13;
* relations and prices. Municipal budgetary support to public transport has&#13;
not grown correspondingly to cover the ensuing financing gap, forcing&#13;
MoAT to partly cross-subsidize bus operations by its other relatively cash-&#13;
generative transport operations and to partly curtail maintenance of the&#13;
fleet. Vehicle replacement rates have been similarly constrained by a lack&#13;
of funds. Recent bus replacement investments have reflected barter&#13;
opportunities  rather than  programmed  purchases.   Under these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                     Chapter I&#13;
procurement conditions, it is difficult to subject investments to economic&#13;
and technical assessment or to assess in advance the complementary&#13;
investments necessary for their optimal operation.&#13;
GOVERNMENT'S URBAN TRANSPORT STRATEGY IN SECTOR&#13;
1.19  The Government recognizes the need for substantial changes to the framework&#13;
within which public transport services are provided in the urban areas. Since the&#13;
commencement of an active dialogue with the Bank on the sector, the Government has&#13;
adopted a reform program for the sector designed to: (a) establish a framework for the&#13;
efficient and cost-effective performance of public sector transport operations; (b) provide&#13;
a stable and adequate level of funding to ensure the sustainability of efficient service&#13;
provision by the public sector; and (c) reduce the fiscal burden on the public sector by&#13;
promoting private sector involvement in the provision of public transport.&#13;
1.20 The reform program as presented in the Government's Policy Statement (June&#13;
1996) included the following key measures (Annex 1.1):&#13;
(a)   consolidation of managerial responsibility for all public sector passenger&#13;
transport operations in each municipality under one autonomous agency&#13;
accountable to the municipal government;&#13;
(b)   institution of explicit operating and financial performance objectives for&#13;
transport agencies by the municipal governments under annual contracts&#13;
for delivery of specified services;&#13;
(c)   determination of the annual subsidy requirements of the agencies in&#13;
advance based on budgets embodying the agreed performance objectives;&#13;
(d)   allocation of each municipality's agreed subsidy requirement in the central&#13;
government budget annually in advance coupled with adequate measures&#13;
to supplement budgetary allocations to take account of increases in&#13;
operating costs that are not compensated by increases in fares;&#13;
(e)   a progressive increase in fares for public transport services provided by the&#13;
municipalities to a level sufficient to cover the full cash costs of operating&#13;
the services; and&#13;
(f)   the expansion of private participation in the provision of public transport&#13;
services through the abolition of regulatory restrictions on the provision&#13;
of taxi and minivan services, the leasing of minivans currently owned and&#13;
operated by the public sector to private operators, the encouragement of&#13;
participation by private operators in the provision of services in selected&#13;
areas of municipalities under contractual agreements with the&#13;
municipalities, and the liberalization of fares for all private sector transport&#13;
operations except for contracted services with the municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1                                                            7&#13;
1.21 In addition to these measures, the Government now requires the public sector&#13;
transport operators to prepare and implement Operations Improvement Plan (OIP),&#13;
presented in Annex 1.2 and discussed in para 4.18 to address weaknesses in their&#13;
operating performance before the Government would commit to provide new&#13;
investments.&#13;
1.22 The Government has already taken a number of key actions to implement the new&#13;
framework for public transport operations. The key elements of the reform program&#13;
implemented by the Government over the past year include:&#13;
(a)   A  Presidential Decree, requiring  the  municipalities to  assume&#13;
responsibility for all mass public sector transport operations in their&#13;
jurisdiction was introduced in March 1996;&#13;
(b)   The Government has established an Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport&#13;
Production Organization (APAPO) designed to introduce and implement&#13;
improved systems and practices to the management of all aspects of urban&#13;
transport operations in Ashghabat. The organization is headed by a&#13;
Director-General and other key positions in the management group are in&#13;
place. The office space for APAPO has been identified;&#13;
(c)   An OIP has been prepared and is under implementation in the city of&#13;
Ashghabat. The successful implementation of OIP would lay the&#13;
groundwork for effective utilization of the significant bus replacement&#13;
investment program planned for the city;&#13;
(d)   The Government is implementing its reform program to improve cost&#13;
recovery. The bus fares have gradually increased from 0.05 manats per&#13;
trip in January 1995 to 50 manats in December 1996. This increase in&#13;
fares is significantly above the rate of devaluation in the domestic&#13;
currency;&#13;
(e)   The private participation in the provision of public transport services has&#13;
expanded through: (a) abolition of regulatory restrictions on the provision&#13;
of taxi and minivan services; (b) the leasing of minivans currently owned&#13;
by the public sector to private operations; and (c) the liberalization of fares&#13;
for all private sector transport operations except for contracted services&#13;
with the municipalities. More recently, a Presidential Decree, requiring&#13;
privatization of a part of the public taxi fleet through open auctions,&#13;
organized by the State Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange of&#13;
Turkmenistan was introduced on July 1, 1996; and&#13;
(f)   APAPO has initiated the Social Assessment to create a foundation for the&#13;
involvement of citizens in providing inputs to transport policy and&#13;
contribute to policy dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                    Chapter I&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.23 Energy consumption and emissions from vehicles are high in former Soviet Union&#13;
countries compared to Western European and North American standards, particularly&#13;
carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). Not only were domestic vehicles&#13;
produced without catalytic converters and basics like electronic ignition and exhaust-gas&#13;
recirculation, but also there was the widespread use of gasoline rather than diesel fueled&#13;
heavy vehicles and buses. About 45 percent of the urban bus fleet in Ashghabat is still&#13;
powered by gasoline rather than less polluting and more fuel-efficient diesel-powered&#13;
engines.&#13;
1.24 Reductions in CO, HC and Pb emissions can be made by changing the&#13;
composition of the vehicle fleet. The project will improve air quality in the project cities&#13;
because of the replacement of gasoline-powered buses by diesel-powered ones,&#13;
rehabilitation and improved maintenance of the bus fleet.&#13;
1.25  The proposed project will not generate activities that create significant new or&#13;
additional environmental impact. The objective of the project is to stabilize public&#13;
transport capacity and restore public transport passenger spaces lost due to past and&#13;
continuing attrition within the bus and trolleybus fleets. The project does not create new&#13;
capacity nor increase fleet sizes beyond previous limits. The impact of the project on&#13;
public transport vehicle emission levels will be moderately beneficial (paras 4.53-4. 54).&#13;
1.26 Draft legislation for environmental legislation and emission standards for&#13;
Turkmenistan has been reviewed during project preparation and the proposed project does&#13;
not conflict with the draft legislation.&#13;
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.27  The role of the Bank in the sector is essentially twofold. First, drawing upon its&#13;
international and regional experience, the Bank is in a strong position to support the&#13;
Government in formulating the strategies necessary to ensure that an adequate, efficient&#13;
and sustainable level of public transport services is available to the urban population.&#13;
Second, the Bank can assist the Government in implementing these strategies through&#13;
both the finaticing of technical advice, training and investments and direct analytical&#13;
support to the Govermment during implementation. The proposed project would also be&#13;
important for the implementation of key reforms, not only in the urban transport sector,&#13;
but also in other areas of the public sector, by demonstrating the effectiveness of such&#13;
reforms.&#13;
1.28  A first Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared, at the&#13;
request of the Government, for discussion by the Board, together with this Operation.&#13;
The proposed project is consistent with that CAS. Specifically, the strategies for&#13;
reorganization, financing, and regulation of urban transport services that the Government&#13;
has adopted, following close dialogue and collaboration with the Bank, would help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

contribute to: (a) reduction of the potential call on the Govemment's fiscal resources for&#13;
operating subsidies and capital investments; (b) promotion of structural reforms in the&#13;
economy by advancing the efficient restructuring and partial privatization of an important&#13;
and visible sector; (c) strengthening of the Government's capacity for the overall&#13;
management of a sector that is critical to efficient economic performance; and (d)&#13;
improvement of access for the relatively poor segment of the urban population to a basic&#13;
transport service.&#13;

2. THE URBAN TRANSPORT SUBSECTOR IN ASHGHABAT&#13;
TRANSPORT SUPPLY CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
2.1   Mass public transport services are provided by diesel bus and trolleybus&#13;
enterprises. The composition of the bus and trolley fleet is summarized in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.2   The total bus fleet in November 1996 was 195 buses (68 Ikarus, 76 Laz, 50 Sahab,&#13;
and 1 Karosa). Since April 1996, 21 Ikarus buses have been scrapped and removed from&#13;
the books and 12 Laz buses have been transferred to other towns. Eighteen buses are&#13;
long-term defective, awaiting engines and can be rehabilitated and returned to service. In&#13;
addition, 34 buses are in workshop for various short-term defects. On average, only 55%&#13;
of the total vehicle fleet is available for service at any time. The low availability of the&#13;
bus fleet reflects two factors. First, the LAZ buses, comprising 40% of the fleet have&#13;
unfavorable design features, are prone to a high rate of failure and require intensive&#13;
maintenance. Second, the bus enterprise has encountered great problems in obtaining the&#13;
financing to import and hold an inventory of spare parts necessary to ensure the adequate&#13;
maintenance of the total fleet of buses at an acceptable level of availability. One adverse&#13;
consequence of the attendant deferral of maintenance of the fleet has been a significant&#13;
acceleration in the deterioration of the mechanical condition of the fleet and the&#13;
shortening in the operating life of buses. The usual practice has been to cannibalize buses&#13;
out of service. At present, buses are operated for six to seven years as compared to an&#13;
assessed operating life of adequately maintained buses, in similar climatic and road&#13;
conditions, of 10 to 15 years.&#13;
2.3   The trolleybus fleet has also experienced similar maintenance and availability&#13;
problems. Out of a total of 63 trolleybuses in 1996, six trolleybuses (with an average age&#13;
greater than 10 years) are life expired and cannibalized to the extent that only shells&#13;
remain. Twelve trolleybuses are over five years old and due to shortage of funds, have&#13;
not undergone the capital repair program required at the mid-life point for trolleybuses.&#13;
At present, only 70% of the vehicle fleet is available for service. Over the past five years,&#13;
the vehicle fleet has been reduced by 18%.&#13;
2.4   The bus enterprise also operates a fleet of minibuses, minivans and taxis. The&#13;
minibus fleet of 134 vehicles consists of 101 buses purchased in 1994 and 33 Mercedes&#13;
purchased in 1995, under barter arrangements with Iran. While the vehicles represent a&#13;
further diversification of vehicle model and spare parts requirement in the fleet of the&#13;
enterprise, no provisions were made for after-sale service facilities or support. After an&#13;
initial period of high reliability in service, the minibus fleet has already started to&#13;
experience increasing mechanical problems and declining availability as a result of the&#13;
enterprise's inability to perform scheduled maintenance and services and the poor quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                   Chapter II&#13;
of buses. A number of measures have been taken by the Government over the past&#13;
eighteen months to privatize operations of minivans and taxis (paras 2.28-2.30).&#13;
2.5   The bus enterprise controls a fleet of about 1,000 taxis consisting predominantly&#13;
of Volgas with an average age of 10 years. A significant addition was made to the fleet&#13;
in 1994 with the purchase of 100 cars from Turkey. Vehicles in the fleet are operated by&#13;
the enterprise for 450,000 km, after which they are leased to the drivers or set aside.&#13;
Lease terms provide for the maintenance of the vehicle by the enterprise. Currently,&#13;
about 60% of the taxi fleet is operational and about 50% of the operational fleet is&#13;
operated on a lease-basis.&#13;
2.6   The RAF minivan fleet consists of 59 vehicles purchased in 1993. Beginning&#13;
March 1996, all minivans are leased out to private operators for unrestricted use within&#13;
the city.&#13;
2.7   The provision of privately owned and operated public transport services, although&#13;
growing, is limited. The Government formally liberalized entry into public passenger&#13;
transport in December 1994, with the eligibility to operate subject to a simple licensing&#13;
and registration process. However, only a small proportion of vehicles has been licensed.&#13;
Nonetheless, there is a vigorous informal and unlicensed private provision of passenger&#13;
services. In particular, private cars and enterprises' own transport play a growing and&#13;
visible role in the. city's transport supply. Enterprise taxis and private cars have increased&#13;
significantly between 1993 and 1994, with private cars increasing from 30,997 in 1993 to&#13;
34,652 in 1994 (growth rate of 11 percent) and enterprise taxis increasing from 768 to&#13;
1,210 (over 50 percent growth rate) for the same time period.&#13;
2.8   Performance Measures of Public Transport Operations. There are 29 diesel-&#13;
bus, 7 trolleybus, and 20 minibus routes in the city. The public transport system, as&#13;
currently structured and operated, suffers from a number of deficiencies:&#13;
(a)   Network Coverage. While the network coverage of the city is generally&#13;
good, it leaves significant segments of the city partially or completely&#13;
unserved. The most prominent unserved area is the northeast which is also&#13;
the part of the city with the lowest household income.&#13;
(b)   Overlapping Services. The overlap in routes served by the three public&#13;
transport systems (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) is excessive and&#13;
leads to significant competition rather than complementary in the&#13;
provision of services. The resulting congestion of services along some&#13;
routes penalizes service quality in other routes while tying up capacity&#13;
which could otherwise be allocated to underserved or high demand zones.&#13;
. (c)   Overlapping routes. The incidence of overlapping routes operated by the&#13;
same system is high. This has led to an inefficient allocation of capacity&#13;
on some routes, as well as excessive traffic on other routes, irregularity of&#13;
service, and undue congestion at bus stops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 11                                                            13&#13;
(d)   Long Routes. Bus and minibus routes are extremely long for urban&#13;
services catering to passengers with an average trip length of about 2 km.&#13;
This leads to long trips for passengers as well as lower than attainable&#13;
frequency of bus arrivals.&#13;
(e)   Service Unreliability.  Owing to frequent vehicle failures and weak&#13;
operational planning and control of crews and vehicles, there are frequent&#13;
and abrupt interruptions of service and the punctuality of service is highly&#13;
variable. In particular, bus service quality varies with the time-of-the-day&#13;
and the day-of-the-week. The highest bus frequencies are available&#13;
during the weekday morning peak period and lower during the afternoon&#13;
peak-period. The frequency of bus arrivals tapers off as the day progresses&#13;
and is lowest during the weekends. In addition, bus drivers often take&#13;
detours to satisfy individual travelers willing to pay higher fares.  The&#13;
unreliability of public transport services often forces people to take the&#13;
more expensive private modes.&#13;
TRANSPORT DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
2.9   Background. A social assessment (SA) was conducted in February 1995, as part&#13;
of the identification process for the proposed urban transport project in Turkmenistan.&#13;
The study was conducted in the capital city of Ashghabat, and focused on various aspects&#13;
of demand and supply of public and private transportation, various stakeholder groups&#13;
(households, transport users, bus drivers, drivers of private vehicles and bus and&#13;
trolleybus enterprises).  It also incorporated results of discussions with the public&#13;
transport agency and the municipality. (Annex 2.2)&#13;
2.10  Objectives.  The overall objective of the  SA was to provide a better&#13;
understanding of the transport use patterns and needs in Ashghabat. The specific&#13;
objectives were to:&#13;
(a)   examine the socio-economic profile of city residents;&#13;
(b)   evaluate the social impact of the proposed project on households and&#13;
investigate how certain social groups may be affected;&#13;
(c)   help identify the most critical interventions to be undertaken to improve&#13;
urban transport in Ashghabat;&#13;
(d)   evaluate prevailing expenditure on transport by different income groups&#13;
and examine users' willingness to pay for improved public transport&#13;
services; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                        Chapter II&#13;
(e)    examine travel characteristics of the different segments of the city&#13;
population.&#13;
2.11   Methodology. The social assessment was conducted by two teams from the&#13;
Magtymguly State University, Ashghabat, and the Turkmen Academy of Sciences,&#13;
Ashghabat. A total of 81 local social scientists and computer specialists were mobilized&#13;
to conduct about 2,000 interviews and analyze data. The research effort was supported&#13;
by a team of social scientists from the World Bank. The social assessment consisted of:&#13;
(a) household survey; (b) transport user survey; (c) vehicle service characteristics survey;&#13;
(d) enterprise survey; and (e) informal meetings with different user and operator groups.&#13;
2.12   Findings. The SA identified five key attributes of&#13;
public transport demand in Ashghabat. First, as in all    TABLE 2.1: SHARE OF PERSON&#13;
FSU  countries, while the share of public transport in    TRIPS BY MODE, 1995&#13;
meeting the mobility needs of the city's population has&#13;
contracted significantly from 90% estimated in a survey in    Mode          Sha&#13;
1991 to 60% in 1995, public transport continues to play a    PublicTransort  60.3%&#13;
dominant role in urban transport services in the city. Of    Bus            36.00/o&#13;
the estimated 560,000 average daily person trips in 1995,    Minibus         7.3%&#13;
Trolleybus        8.0%&#13;
almost 60 percent use some form  of public transport,    Taxi                9.00/0&#13;
while the rest use private vehicles or enterprise transport&#13;
or walk. The contraction in the share of public transport is    Private Trnport    39.7%&#13;
Enterprise Bus    6.90/o&#13;
attributable mainly to three factors: (i) the decline in the    Walk        20.0%/o&#13;
service capacity and reliability of the public transport    Private Car     12.8%&#13;
fleet; (ii) the growth in private vehicle ownership and in&#13;
own-transport  by enterprises; and (iii) the expanding&#13;
settlement in the peripheral areas of the city that are&#13;
unserved or underserved by the public transport network. The SA also highlighted the&#13;
existence of inadequate support infrastructure, including street lighting and sheltered bus&#13;
stops. Second, about 50 percent of the trips using public transport vehicles are work trips,&#13;
10 percent are school trips and the balance are shop and social trips. Third, on average,&#13;
trip duration using public transport is 41 minutes (including time to walk to bus stop and&#13;
waiting for a bus). Average waiting time for a bus is about 20 minutes. However, there&#13;
is considerable variation around this mean trip time depending on the time-of-the-day.&#13;
People walking to their destination, on average, walk for 19 minutes and generally work&#13;
in the vicinity of their residences. Fourth, average household expenditure on transport&#13;
varies from 6 percent for high-income groups to 12 percent for low-income groups. The&#13;
poor people pay a lot more for meeting daily transport needs than the fare on public&#13;
transport would suggest, because of the necessity to use private transport modes at ten-&#13;
time the official fare. In addition, many of the poor people are forced to undertake most&#13;
of the journey on foot. Fifth, use of various modes of transport services in Ashghabat is&#13;
highly differentiated both by gender and ethnicity. For example, 28 percent of women&#13;
walk to work as compared to 14 percent of men; 7 percent of women commute by car as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II                                                              15&#13;
compared to 20 percent of men; and 10 percent of women use enterprise transport as&#13;
compared to 20 percent by men.&#13;
2.13  The SA also underscored that with a decline in public transport services, people&#13;
have had to use other arrangements to satisfy their daily mobility needs, including,&#13;
changing their work place to be closer to home, abandoning shift-working, or using&#13;
informal services.  The data revealed that a high  percentage of people (almost 80&#13;
percent) reported paying much more than the prevailing "official fares" on public&#13;
transport services.&#13;
2.14 A review of improvements suggested by residents showed a strong preference for&#13;
management and institutional reform. With regard to willingness to pay, almost all users&#13;
(94 percent) reported willingness to pay for improved services. When people were asked&#13;
to identify specific improvements expected, they reported the need for higher vehicle&#13;
frequency, reliability, additional routes, and better comfort. The SA clearly illustrated&#13;
that tariff increases, in conjunction with other reforms, would reduce the real "out-of-&#13;
pocket" costs for users, while improving services. Low fares in the past have not resulted&#13;
in cheap transport for the people, who have had to resort to more expensive forms of&#13;
transport services-to satisfy their mobility needs.&#13;
2.15  Participatory Process. A stakeholder workshop was held in October 1995 to&#13;
share results with the academic community, representatives of MoAT, the municipality,&#13;
operators, and the users. The SA results provided inputs to project preparation based on&#13;
what the majority of the city's population actually saw as priorities. The SA created a&#13;
foundation for the future involvement of citizens in making immediate inputs to transport&#13;
policy and development, contributed to policy dialogue, laid the basis for internal reforms&#13;
that could be instituted without major cost, and contributed to the overall process of&#13;
reform and democratization by linking decision makers to public opinion on a matter of&#13;
general concern. As a result of SA findings, the government has already, in the past&#13;
eighteen months, instituted reforms, raised bus fares, and improved provision of public&#13;
transport services in the city. The specific initiatives undertaken by the government&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   salaries of bus and trolleybus drivers were raised substantially in an&#13;
attempt to reduce pilferage and improve discipline. Transport supervisors&#13;
were designated to ride on buses to enforce operations;&#13;
(b)   the bus fare was increased ten times (from 0.05 manat to 0.5 manat per&#13;
trip) in July 1995, another ten-times increase in December 1995 (from 0.5&#13;
to 5 manat), another four-fold increase (from 5 manat to 20 manat) was&#13;
implemented in July, 1996 and most recently, in December 1996, bus fares&#13;
have been increased to 50 ma!nats. As a result, the liquidity situation of&#13;
public transport enterprises was improved. In addition, the discretionary&#13;
charges imposed by bus drivers were reduced, resulting in an actual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                Chapter II&#13;
reduction in the cost of travel to all, and especially to poor with greater&#13;
dependence on public transport.&#13;
(c)    vehicle maintenance was improved, which together with improved driver&#13;
performance allowed better scheduling. Buses displayed routes and fares;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)    internal management and personnel were strengthened.&#13;
2.16 These initiatives went a long way in restoring public confidence in government's&#13;
efforts to improve transport services and laid a basis for future reforms. The social&#13;
assessment has become a part of the on-going effort by the government to assess,&#13;
monitor, and evaluate different approaches to addressing specific concerns of the&#13;
residents of Ashghabat. (Box 2.1)&#13;
Box 2.1: Social Assessment Initiatives by the Government of Turkmenistan&#13;
Over the past six months, the Government has developed social assessment approach to assess, monitor,&#13;
and formulate different strategies to address specific concerns of the residents of Ashghabat. The newly&#13;
formed bus transport management organization in Ashghabat (APAPO) has a social assessment wing,&#13;
headed by a sociologist, with the mandate to solicit opinions from the city residents on specific transport&#13;
related concerns, redress their grievances, and identify critical interventions to improve the city transport.&#13;
A dedicated hot line has been established for the residents to express their concerns.&#13;
Between August, 1996 and December, 1996, the social assessment team has conducted a random survey of&#13;
400 residents in the city.  The survey is designed as a three-page questionnaire.  The typical&#13;
recommendations made by the residents include:&#13;
*  change in bus stop locations to address passenger demand;&#13;
*  extend bus routes to better serve the residents;&#13;
*  increase in number of buses along corridors of heavy demand;&#13;
*  redesign bus routes to improve accessibility of poorly served areas;&#13;
*  improve bus scheduling;&#13;
*  provide better information on busstop signs;&#13;
*  display bus tariffs to control overcharging;&#13;
*  improve cleanliness in buses;&#13;
*  provide safe environment for commuters;&#13;
*  improve drivers' training to improve service quality; and&#13;
*  improve fare collection procedures.&#13;
The SA team analyzes the data and prepares a report for implementation by the transport companies. Most&#13;
of the concerns and issues raised by the residents have already been addressed by the transport companies.&#13;
The bus routes have been changed to accommodate residents' demands, frequency on some corridors has&#13;
been increased, new routes have been introduced, more efficient fare collection reporting systems have&#13;
been introduced, better discipline is enforced, and disciplinary action has been taken against a number of&#13;
bus drivers and staff for violating rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II                                                              17&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
2.17  Fares Policy and Revenue Generation. Public policy objective in setting bus&#13;
and trolleybus fares is to ensure that public transport is accessible to all segments of the&#13;
population. Up until June 1995, the fares for buses and trolleybuses were set at 0.05&#13;
manats per trip, leading to a significant erosion in their real value when compared to&#13;
inflation of about 25% over the same period. More graphically, by June 1995, the value&#13;
of bus fare per trip had been eroded to the point where it was equal to the cost of printing&#13;
a ticket.&#13;
2.18  In principle, the rigid control of public transport fares was meant to ensure that&#13;
public transport was affordable to all segments of the population. No efforts were made&#13;
in the past to evaluate if the residents could afford to pay higher fare for a better and more&#13;
reliable service or even what they were actually paying to satisfy their daily transport&#13;
requirements. In .practice, low fares led to: (a) a severe squeeze in the operating margin&#13;
of operators which was not compensated by operating subsidies from the municipality or&#13;
the Government; (b) a sharp deterioration in service quality; and (c) increasing diversion&#13;
of the population to other emerging and more expensive modes, primarily informal taxis.&#13;
The adverse side-effects of the bus fares policy on the effective cost of public transport&#13;
was exacerbated by two other factors: (a) the high rates of inflation led to a progressive&#13;
withdrawal of the low denomination 0.05 manat coins from circulation, forcing many&#13;
passengers to use higher denomination (2 manat) currency for the 0.05 manat fare; and&#13;
(b) households demonstrated willingness to pay substantially in excess of regulated fares,&#13;
coupled with poor supervisory control over bus drivers, provided strong incentives for&#13;
drivers to charge in excess of officially set fares, for personal gains. Often, the drivers&#13;
charged arbitrary fares (especially during off-peak period) giving riders the choice to&#13;
either pay or get off. Finally, monthly passes, which at 5 manats per month offered&#13;
potentially substantial discounts on the official fares to frequent users, became&#13;
increasingly unattractive as the predictability of the bus and trolleybus services&#13;
deteriorated.&#13;
2.19  The findings of the Social Assessment demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the&#13;
fares policy as an instrument for ensuring the affordability of public transport. The&#13;
majority (70%) of users were paying about 2.0 manats per trip using public transport&#13;
while the average cost of trips for cash paying respondents was about 3.2 manats for&#13;
transport, including taxis and minivans (as against the official fare of 0.05 manat per trip&#13;
for public transport). In addition, as almost 65 percent of the respondents were required&#13;
to change mode at least once to complete a trip, the average actual fare paid for one trip&#13;
was increased to about 5 manat.&#13;
2.20  Cost Recovery. Between January 1995, when the preparation of this urban&#13;
transport project started, and December 1996, the bus fares have gradually increased one-&#13;
thousand fold (para 2.15). As a result of the increase in fare structure, cost recovery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                          Chapter II&#13;
(excluding depreciation) has increased from less than three percent in 1995 to more than&#13;
ten percent in 1996 (see Table 2.2). The financial data presented in Table 2.2 reflects an&#13;
average for the 1996 fiscal year. Focusing only on the month of December 1996 when&#13;
the most recent fare increase was announced, cost recovery improved to more than 25&#13;
percent (for an explanation of the significantly higher cost recovery for minibuses, see&#13;
para 2.22). However, this cost recovery ratio overstates the financial performance of the&#13;
operating enterprises because maintenance expenditures are underestimated. Most of the&#13;
maintenance and repairs performed on the vehicles are undertaken with parts cannibalized&#13;
from other vehicles, recycled, or fabricated in-house and the cost of these services is not&#13;
fully reflected in the enterprise's accounts. In addition, a number of buses are allowed to&#13;
fall to a condition of disrepair so that average vehicle availability has continued to&#13;
decline. The resulting high rate of bus attrition has adversely impacted service frequency&#13;
and reliability.&#13;
2.21   In addition to low fares, cost recovery is further reduced because more than 60&#13;
percent of bus riders are either exempted from paying fare or manage to evade making a&#13;
payment. The category of people exempted from paying fare in Ashghabat is contained&#13;
in Box 2.2. As a result, only about 40 percent of the riders pay for using bus services.&#13;
The existing system for fare payments allows considerable leakages in revenue collection.&#13;
Assurances were receivedfrom the Government during negotiations that: (a) number&#13;
ofpeople receivingfare exemptions would be reduced; and (b) efficientfare collection&#13;
system would be set in place to eliminate fare evasion.&#13;

Box 2.2: Exemptions From Payment For Use of Public Urban Transport&#13;
In reviewing the revenue profile of the Ashghabat bus service, the following categories of people were exempted&#13;
from paying fares.&#13;
Payment For Children&#13;
On suburban and city bus and taxi routes every adult may transport, for free, one child under the age of seven as&#13;
long as the child does not occupy a separate seat. If however, there are several children under the age of seven (in&#13;
one party), the full fare is payable for all but one child.&#13;
Cabinet Members of Turkmenistan, heroes of Turkmenistan for recipients of honors received from the former&#13;
USSR for all types of public transport.&#13;
Participants in the Great Patriotic War; the Afghanistan War and people awarded with medals and orders from the&#13;
former USSR for labor and military service; parents and wives of military servicemen killed defending the USSR&#13;
for all urban transportation (excluding taxis).&#13;
Handicapped children under the age of 16, invalids of groups I and II because of the defects of eyesight, hearing&#13;
and speech and people accompanying invalids of group I for all urban transportation, excluding taxis.&#13;
School children living in rural areas traveling to schools situated in villages or cities.&#13;
Medical workers (doctors, nurses) transporting sick people.&#13;
Drivers and conductors of bus and transport companies and control service employees of MoAT.&#13;
Veterans of labor, (pensioners) and GPW, and family members of perished soldiers for all types of urban transport&#13;
(except taxi).&#13;
Inspectors or the Prosecutors office, bailiffs and policemen.&#13;
Miscellaneous other groups.&#13;
Preferential Passes for Buses for Inter-City Transport Provided to the following:&#13;
Students of comprehensive, special, and boarding schools and professional colleges.&#13;
Children and adolescents from I st June to 31 st August pay 20% of the tariff.&#13;
From November I - March 31, students older than 12 years pay 50% of the tariff.&#13;
Reimbursements for transport companies for free and preferential tickets is meant to be financed from local&#13;
budgets in accordance with Presidential decree N369 of 19 August 1991.&#13;
2.22    Cost recovery on the minibus services has been significantly better (125 percent)&#13;
because of: (a) a Government decision to allow higher fares (almost ten times) on the&#13;
minibuses which, as compared to diesel buses and trolleybuses, were expected to offer a&#13;
better quality of service; (b) the low maintenance requirement in the early part of life of&#13;
the new minibuses and, correspondingly, the higher utilization rate of the fleet; and (c)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                 Chapter 11&#13;
higher revenues obtained from the rental of the older fleet of minivans to enterprises and&#13;
from the leasing of the vehicles to the drivers and third parties. The cost recovery ratio&#13;
on this fleet however is coming under increasing pressure. As the IVECO bus fleet ages,&#13;
its maintenance costs increases and its availability declines; and as the RAF minivans are&#13;
retired from service, their contribution to fixed costs are reduced. In addition, the&#13;
Govermnent's decision in January 1997 to reduce fares on minibuses to bring them on par&#13;
with other bus services operating in the city would further reduce cost recovery ratio of&#13;
these services in future.&#13;
2.23 Agreements were reached at negotiations that cost recovery for bus and&#13;
trolleybus would improve to 40 percent (excluding depreciation) as an average over a&#13;
two-month period, as a condition of Loan effectiveness.&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT STRATEGY FOR ASHGHABAT&#13;
2.24  The Government recognizes that comprehensive policy reform is needed to&#13;
address the underlying causes of the deficiencies in the provision of transport services.&#13;
An Urban Transport Policy Statement was issued by the Government in June 1996. A&#13;
detailed Action Plan has been developed to support the Government's Transport Policy&#13;
Statement (Annex 1. 1). Confirmation of the measures contained in the Action Plan&#13;
has been obtainedfrom the Government during negotiations. The following sections&#13;
briefly discuss the measures contained in the Action Plan.&#13;
2.25  Pricing. The present system of fares undermines the capacity of the bus operators&#13;
in Ashghabat to generate financial resources necessary to maintain the adequacy and&#13;
efficiency of the present level of service, especially given the capacity of the&#13;
municipalities and the central government to finance countervailing subsidies on a timely&#13;
and predictable basis. To alleviate this problem, the Government has: (a) increased bus&#13;
fare 1000-fold (paragraph 2.15); (b) improved fare collection and monitoring systems;&#13;
and (c) re-examine number of exemption categories with a view to reducing number of&#13;
people receiving exemptions.&#13;
2.26 Subsidy Regime. The effort by the Government is to target transport subsidies to&#13;
the truly needy -and to reduce exemptions.  To protect the identifiable groups of&#13;
individuals for whom tariff increases will not be affordable, the Governnent will review&#13;
and introduce appropriate measures to target subsidies directly to such individuals. The&#13;
Government is currently examining the subsidy system from one in which subsidy&#13;
requirements are determined after losses are incurred to one where subsidy requirements&#13;
are determined annually in advance based on the operating budget of the enterprise. The&#13;
Government recognizes that without honoring the subsidy obligation, the capacity of the&#13;
system would inevitably decline. The operating budget would take due account of the&#13;
contracted service obligations (including the difference between fares paid by recipients&#13;
of such subsidies and the full fare), anticipated tariff levels and operating costs necessary&#13;
to support efficient operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 11                                                              21&#13;
2.27 Institutional Arrangements. An important element of the urban transport&#13;
reform program adopted by the Government is to consolidate managerial responsibility&#13;
for all public sector passenger transport operations in Ashghabat (bus, trolley bus, and&#13;
minibus) under one autonomous agency.  This would reduce fragmentation of&#13;
responsibility and strengthen operational management and policy planning in urban&#13;
transport in Ashghabat. Towards this objective, the Government has already issued a&#13;
decree (para. 1.22) creating Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport Production Organization&#13;
(APAPO), responsible for overall management and planning for all public transport&#13;
operations in the city.&#13;
2.28  Privatization of Transport Services. There is an important role for minivans and&#13;
taxi services in the provision of transport services in Ashghabat. The provision of these&#13;
services can be undertaken by the private sector without the attendant drain on public&#13;
resources, which could be better devoted to operating a mass transport system. Over the&#13;
past year, the Government of Turkmenistan has taken measures to privatize operations of&#13;
minivans and taxis by leasing them to drivers and allowing them to keep a share of daily&#13;
return, after a certain monthly payment has been made. The Government's policy is to&#13;
encourage increased participation of the private sector in service provision to encourage&#13;
competition and reduce costs through: (a) competitive tendering of taxi and minivan&#13;
vehicle requirements of the municipalities; (b) selective transfer of the minivan and taxi&#13;
fleet to private operators through leasing and sale of such vehicles or the transfer of&#13;
operating rights to such vehicles; and (c) further review and reform of the administration&#13;
of the licensing system for private passenger transport operators. The Government&#13;
introduced open access to taxi services by the private sector in December 1994 and is&#13;
currently studying the changes to licensing procedures and the regulation of operators that&#13;
are necessary to attract more operators into the market.&#13;
2.29  The ownership of taxi fleet is with public enterprise, and the drivers are required&#13;
to pay 60,000 manats per vehicle-operating-day (an increase from 500 manats in July&#13;
1995) for eight hours of operation and retain the balance of revenue receipts. Fares on&#13;
taxis are set at 300 manats per passenger-km (an increase from 5 manat per passenger-km&#13;
in July 1995). In practice, taxi drivers charge two to three times the officially set fare and&#13;
even more during late evening hours and holidays. In return for payment to the taxi&#13;
garage, drivers get about 300 liters of petrol per month and maintenance is the&#13;
responsibility of the MoAT's taxi garage. In practice, the petrol quota is sufficient for&#13;
only about ten days, after which the drivers have to purchase their own petrol. The&#13;
maintenance obligation is also rarely discharged by the garages due to shortage of parts.&#13;
Nominal cost recovery is high due to the omissions in the system of accounting for the&#13;
maintenance service. Revenues from taxi operations are used to cross-subsidize the&#13;
operating costs of bus services, with very little resources reinvested in maintaining the&#13;
taxi fleet. As presently operated, the full burden of replacing the fleet falls on the central&#13;
government. Simulations performed by MoAT indicates that, under plausible operating&#13;
assumptions and current prices, the total return on a second-hand market value of a&#13;
vehicle being operated as a taxi is attractive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                  Chapter 11&#13;
2.30  A Presidential Decree was issued on July 1, 1996, to privatize part of the taxi fleet&#13;
in Ashghabat. In accordance with the Decree of the President of Turkmenistan (No.&#13;
2702) "On the realization procedure of state enterprises and organization vehicles", for&#13;
the purpose of pursuing market-oriented reforms in service-oriented transport sector, the&#13;
following measures were introduced: (a) to allow the ministries, agencies, state-owned&#13;
enterprises and organizations to realize privatization of vehicles fully depreciated or&#13;
technically unfit for further exploitation in the economy of the country through the State&#13;
Commodity and Raw Material Exchange; (b) to approve the attached regulations "On the&#13;
realization procedure of state enterprises and organization vehicles" (Annex 2.3); (c) to&#13;
adopt, hereinafter, that revenues obtained from privatization of the vehicles of self-&#13;
supporting enterprises shall be credited to the enterprises' settlement accounts and&#13;
channeled for renovation of rolling stock fleet; (d) to channel to the income of an&#13;
appropriate budget the revenues obtained from privatization of the vehicles of budgetary&#13;
enterprises and organizations; and (e) to conduct privatization procedures of state&#13;
enterprises and organization vehicles under the authority of the Ministry of Economics&#13;
and Finance of Turkmenistan, as well as, the State Commodity and Raw Materials&#13;
Exchange of Turkmenistan. A total of 800 taxis or about half the total taxi fleet in&#13;
Ashghabat, presently owned by the taxi garage in the MoAT, have been identified to be&#13;
sold to private individuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.1   Since 1972, the World Bank has funded over thirty urban transport projects and an&#13;
even larger number of urban development projects with a substantial urban transport&#13;
component. These projects have been quite diversified in terms of content, countries, and&#13;
circumstances under which they have been designed and implemented. The major&#13;
objective of World Bank lending for urban transport has been to improve and extend&#13;
available facilities and services through the use of low cost options. For this reason, the&#13;
greatest emphasis has been placed on: (a) rationalization of the use of urban transport&#13;
facilities, particularly urban roads; (b) provision of better access through upgrading and&#13;
extension of the road networks; and (c) improvement in the standards and viability of&#13;
public transport services. A more general objective has been to meet the special needs of&#13;
the urban poor. Upgrading and extending road networks in low income neighborhoods&#13;
has also been a priority, as well as improving the public transport services benefiting the&#13;
poor. Other objectives of World Bank urban transport operations have been to improve&#13;
planning and coordination and to better integrate urban transport with urban development.&#13;
More recently, Bank objectives have focused on the privatization of urban transport,&#13;
including contracting out maintenance and other services, but most of the projects&#13;
incorporating these objectives are ongoing projects.&#13;
3.2   With few exceptions, physical components of urban transport projects were&#13;
generally implemented as planned. While some changes did take place and some&#13;
components were poorly planned, the physical components proposed at appraisal proved&#13;
to be feasible and supported by decision makers. Overall estimated project costs were&#13;
also of the right order, although wide variations in individual components occurred.&#13;
3.3   Transport policy measures were included in some, but not all projects, with mixed&#13;
results. A number of projects (Bombay, Madras, Cote d'Ivoire and Calcutta) invested in&#13;
public bus or monopoly bus operations (often supplying buses). Except in Calcutta, all&#13;
the companies were relatively efficient with, for example, availability of the fleet of the&#13;
order of 90 percent and reasonable staffing ratios. All companies made operational&#13;
improvements during project implementation. Nevertheless, governments were reluctant&#13;
to allow bus fares to rise adequately to meet agreed revenue/cost ratios (covenanted under&#13;
the loans) and for financial targets to be met, demonstrating the political difficulties of&#13;
raising fares.&#13;
3.4   Project schedules were chronically over-optimistic at appraisal, due to:  (a)&#13;
difficulties of implementing traffic schemes; (b) failure to complete final designs in a&#13;
timely manner; (G) unfamiliarity with World Bank procedures (especially procurement);&#13;
and (d) lack of counterpart funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                 Chapter III&#13;
3.5   The Bank is currently financing two urban transport projects in the FSU - one in&#13;
Russia (Ln 8806-RU) and one in Kazakstan (Ln 8511-RU). Both projects are progressing&#13;
satisfactorily. and achieving their development objectives. In Kazakstan, there has been&#13;
considerable progress in the design and implementation of policy and institutional&#13;
reforms in the three participating cities. Cost recovery targets have been exceeded,&#13;
sufficient funds have been allocated to the transit companies for operations and&#13;
considerable progress has been made on privatization of bus services. In Russia, transit&#13;
services have been decentralized, cost recovery targets have been exceeded by many of&#13;
the 14 participating cities, and key institutional measures have been taken.&#13;
3.6   The lessons of World Bank experience have been taken into account in the design&#13;
of the project. The preparation of the project has been structured with a view to&#13;
minimizing implementation delays: (a) procurement is well advanced - standard bidding&#13;
documents for the purchase of new vehicles have been substantially agreed with the&#13;
Government; (b) an OIP has been agreed upon and should be implemented before the&#13;
loan becomes effective; (c) a new agency (the APAPO) is established to introduce&#13;
improved systems and practices to the management of all aspects of urban transport&#13;
operations in the city of Ashghabat. The Government has already increased fares by one-&#13;
thousand times since preparation of the project began and it has agreed to improve cost&#13;
recovery (excluding depreciation) to 40% by loan effectiveness. Agreements were&#13;
reached during negotiations to improve cost recovery of the participating transport&#13;
oomnpanies (excluding depreciation) to 100% by December 31, 1999, in accordance&#13;
with a mutually agreed time bound plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT&#13;
4.1   The objective is to improve, on a sustainable basis, the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
urban transport operations in the Municipalities of Ashghabat, Mary, and Chardjou. Specifically,&#13;
the proposed investments would: (a) reform management of the agencies in charge of urban&#13;
transport operations in the three participating cities; (b) establish a metropolitan transport&#13;
organization (APAPO) responsible for the overall management of bus operations; (c) improve&#13;
cost recovery of the operating enterprises; (d) implement an Operations Improvement Plan; (e)&#13;
augment and preserve supply of bus services; (f) enhance private sector participation in the&#13;
provision of urban transport services; and (g) establish a continuing process of public&#13;
consultation.&#13;
GENESIS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
4.2   The formulation and implementation of a viable and sustainable strategy for the provision&#13;
of urban transport services is recognized by the Government as an important element of its&#13;
development program. The Government has begun to place increased emphasis on encouraging&#13;
private sector investment and improved cost recovery in selected public sector activities as a&#13;
means of increasing efficiency and mobilizing resources for development.&#13;
4.3   Similar to other countries of the former Soviet Union, Turkmenistan is currently&#13;
experiencing a shortage of operable urban public transport vehicles and a corresponding decline&#13;
in transport services. The shortage of operable vehicles has been caused by a number of factors&#13;
including poor cost recovery as a result of low transit fares, combined with many exemptions and&#13;
extensive fare evasion, poor quality vehicles, underfunded and poor maintenance practices, and&#13;
generally weak institutional arrangements for the management and regulation of urban transport&#13;
services. The urban poor and middle classes are most affected by this decline in service as they&#13;
do not have ready access to alternative means of transport. Transport conditions in other major&#13;
cities are even worse than in Ashghabat.&#13;
4.4   Bank involvement in the project would help to ensure that the evolving Government&#13;
strategy to improve urban transport services builds on the considerable experience gained and the&#13;
lessons learnt from urban transport projects and reforms in the delivery of public services in&#13;
other countries. Beyond addressing urban transport issues and taking into account that this&#13;
project would be the first investment operation of the Bank in Turkmenistan, the project would&#13;
introduce competitive goods procurement to the country which should have a demonstration&#13;
impact well beyond the confines of the project.&#13;
4.5   A study of demand and supply of public transport services in Ashghabat was conducted&#13;
by the Government (with financial assistance of the Government of Italy through a Bank-&#13;
administered trust fund) in 1995. Based on the results of this study, a phased program of&#13;
investment requirements was developed by the Government. Key inputs into project design were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                 Chapter IV&#13;

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.   Transport Vehicles&#13;
4.7   City of Ashghabat. The project includes purchase of 52 twelve-meter diesel buses (at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$120,000 per bus), 10 CNG/diesel buses (at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$135,000 per bus), and 40 twelve meter trolleybuses (at an estimated cost of US$160,000 per&#13;
trolleybus). The inclusion of 10 CNG/diesel buses is proposed as a pilot to test technology&#13;
viability of CNG buses in Ashghabat operating conditions. The Government has taken a policy&#13;
decision to promote CNG-powered buses to address environmental concerns and exploit low cost&#13;
abundant supply of CNG. This component also includes a mobile charging unit and equipment&#13;
for CNG buses, to be financed by the Government. Buses financed under the loan will have a&#13;
longer life, higher availability, require fewer spare parts, and be more fuel-efficient. Agreement&#13;
was reached at negotiations on a detailed draft of the technical specifications for buses and&#13;
trolleybuses.&#13;
4.8   Cities of Mary and Chardjou. The project will include purchase of about twenty-eight&#13;
twelve-meter diesel buses for the cities of Mary and Chardjou. The exact number of buses to be&#13;
financed by this project will be determined by completion of a detailed investment plan for the&#13;
two cities, specifying the age profile of the existing buses, number of buses on road, and an&#13;
assessment of the demand gap in the provision of services. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Government that as a condition of disbursement of this component, the&#13;
Government will submit a detailed investment program for the purchase of new buses for the&#13;
two cities, satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
B.   Maintenance and Rehabilitation&#13;
City of Ashghabat&#13;
4.9   Rehabilitation of vehicles. The project will include rehabilitation of 81 buses, 34&#13;
trolleybuses and 33 minibuses. The Bank loan will finance spare parts for rehabilitation of 60&#13;
Ikarus buses (US$1.5 million, at an average cost of US$25,000 per bus) and 34 trolley buses&#13;
(US$1.02 million, at an average cost of US$30,000 per trolleybus). For minibuses, the Bank&#13;
loan will finance spare parts for (a) a program of modification for 101 Iveco minibuses (at an&#13;
average cost of US$2,700 per bus) to increase their operational life to nine years, and (b)&#13;
rehabilitation of 33 minibuses (US$0.33 million, at an average cost of US$10,000 per bus). The&#13;
Government will finance for the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses (US$0.32 million, at an average&#13;
cost of US$15,000 per bus) and for labor and utilities costs of US$0.19 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                 Chapter IV&#13;
4.10  Replenishment of the spare parts inventory. Inventories of spare parts for buses,&#13;
trolleybuses and minibuses have been allowed to fall to critical levels, making it impossible to&#13;
maintain the vehicles to satisfactory standards. The Bank loan will finance replenishment of&#13;
spare parts inventories to maintain an average inventory level equal to six months over a two-&#13;
year period. For buses, the Bank Joan will finance US$0.8 million, for trolleybuses US$0.59&#13;
million, and for minibuses US$0.40 million. In addition, the Government will finance US$0.75&#13;
million for buses, US$0.01 million for trolleybuses, and US$0.01 for minibuses.&#13;
4.11  Workshop, computers and other tools and equipment. Urban transport companies'&#13;
workshops and other equipment are inadequate for the efficient operation of urban transport&#13;
services in Ashghabat. In particular, there could be substantial improvement of maintenance&#13;
operations if urban transport companies were provided, for example, with paint booths, welders,&#13;
steam cleaners, sandblasters, machine shop tools, hand tools and other items of equipment.&#13;
Operations would also improve if there were more computers for activities such as route&#13;
planning and scheduling, inventory control and accounting and cost control. The total cost of&#13;
workshop, computers and other equipment to be financed by the Bank is estimated at about&#13;
US$0.59 million for buses, US$1.19 million for trolleybuses and US$0.69 million for minibuses.&#13;
The estimated cost of works and materials to be financed by operating companies is US$0.3&#13;
million. This component will also include procurement of equipment to set up a tire retreading&#13;
facility. This facility would initially service the Ashghabat urban vehicle fleet. The aim is to&#13;
recycle the tire stock through a minimum of two retreading processes. The workshop tools and&#13;
equipment, to be financed under the loan, will be used to equip the Capital Repair Facility in&#13;
Ashghabat (excluding civil works). Agreement was reached during negotiations that the&#13;
Government will provide the following by loan effectiveness: (a) a business plan, showing&#13;
feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this facility; (b) a plan for attracting other business into&#13;
this workshop; (c) a set of options available to bus enterprises to perform the capital repairs&#13;
themselves, if they so decide; and (d) identification of the quality of service to be provided by&#13;
this facility, including specified service fee.&#13;
4.12  OIP-related Investments.  To improve monitoring of vehicles in public transport&#13;
enterprises and improve fare collection, the proposed project includes provision for US$2.0&#13;
million for investments in related equipment. The proposed investments, if justified, would&#13;
include: (a) Automatic Vehicle Location and Monitoring System (AVLM); and (b) ticketing&#13;
System.&#13;
4.13  The AVLM has three main objectives: (a) to provide real-time location of vehicles in&#13;
service and permit a transport control room to adjust service intervals or take other corrective&#13;
actions; (b) to provide a control and monitoring mechanism to detect unauthorized deviations&#13;
from route by drivers; and (c) to provide data inputs to service planning data systems. The&#13;
component will procure the necessary equipment to set up data and/or communication links&#13;
between available vehicles (about 350) and a central route control facility. Regarding the&#13;
automatic ticketing system, an analysis will be carried out on the most efficient collection system&#13;
for Ashghabat, including the ticketing system. Agreement was reached during negotiations that&#13;
the completion offeasibility studies and an implementation strategy, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
for the OIP-related investments would be a condition of disbursementfor this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IV                                                                 29&#13;
4.14 Incremental Operating Costs. The utility and operating costs associated with the&#13;
additional vehicles made available under the project (including both new purchases and&#13;
rehabilitated fleet) will be financed by the respective operating companies. The costs would&#13;
include expenses for additional operating staff, fuel, tire and other operating costs related to&#13;
operating additional vehicles made available under the project. The net incremental operating&#13;
cost, for a period of two years, is estimated at about US$1.0 million, to be financed by the&#13;
operating companies.&#13;
4.15 Establishment of APAPO. A new office for APAPO has been provided by&#13;
Government, but it will require some additional work, furnishings and office equipment. The&#13;
estimated cost of these works and materials, to be financed by the Government, is US$300,000.&#13;
In addition, Government will finance the services of an independent auditor.&#13;
4.16 Cities of Mary and Chardjou. The Bank loan will finance US$1.54 million for&#13;
rehabilitation of buses, replenishment of spare parts inventory and workshop tools and&#13;
equipment. The two participating cities will contribute US$ 100,000 for labor and utility costs.&#13;
To qualify for inclusion in the project, APAPO must carry out a study of the urban transport&#13;
requirements in the two cities, satisfactory to the Bank. The cities must demonstrate&#13;
commitment to an urban transport reform program similar to that implemented in the city of&#13;
Ashghabat. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would submit the&#13;
following for the two cities as a condition of disbursement: (a) policy statement, including&#13;
OIP and project implementation arrangements; (b) executed Administration Agreement,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, between the Borrower, each municipality and APAPO; (c) conclusion&#13;
of a performance contract between APAPO and each of the two transport companies&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) conclusion of a service contract between each municipality&#13;
and APAPO, satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
C.   Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
4.17 TA to APAPO. External assistance will be provided to APAPO in two phases. Phase I,&#13;
to be financed by the recently executed Project Preparation Facility (PPF), would be executed&#13;
over a 9 to 12 month period. A PPF advance of US$600,000 has been approved by the Bank and&#13;
agreed by the Government, of which US$4 10,000 will be for this component. Phase II, the exact&#13;
scale and scope to be determined during Phase I, would be financed under the main loan.&#13;
Preliminary estimates indicate that a minimum of 60 man-months of consultant assistance would&#13;
be needed during Phases I and II over about a 30 to 36 month period. Specifically, the external&#13;
staff would: (a) introduce improved systems and practices for the management of all aspects of&#13;
urban transport operations in the city of Ashghabat including the implementation of OIP and the&#13;
modernization of management, accounting, planning and budgeting systems; (b) develop a&#13;
program to assess and improve the operational efficiency Mary and Chardjou transport&#13;
enterprises; (c) develop and maintain project accounts and the accounts of APAPO and review&#13;
those of the operating companies, including supervision of annual audits by an independent&#13;
auditor; and (d) provide inspection services to monitor the production and delivery of buses and&#13;
trolleybuses financed under the loan. Draft terms of reference for the technical support specialists&#13;
are provided in Annex 4. 1. The execution of a contract, on terms and conditions satisfactory to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                 Chapter IV&#13;
the Bank, of the external consultants to APAPO to assist in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the project and to provide technical support to Ashghabat, and the MoAT is&#13;
a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.18 Operations Improvement Plan. APAPO, supported by the specialists financed under&#13;
this loan, would introduce operational systems, procedures and supervisory practices required to&#13;
support efficient operations of the transport enterprises and effective utilization of the assets. To&#13;
identify the required changes in systems and practices, an Operations Improvement Plan (OIP)&#13;
was developed by APAPO and MoAT, based on a detailed audit of all transport activities and&#13;
related operations information management and supervisory practices. During project&#13;
preparation, the management of the bus and trolleybus enterprises felt the need for development&#13;
of an OIP to improve capacity and reliability of passenger transport services in Ashghabat by:&#13;
(a) implementing a maintenance program to increase the availability of the vehicle fleet;&#13;
(b) taking other measures which require little financial resources, to improve operations,&#13;
maintenance and general management; and (c) monitoring qualitative and quantitative targets for&#13;
service improvements. The OIP is presented in Annex 1.2. The performance monitoring&#13;
indicators to evaluate on a continuous basis, the implementation of the project and achievement&#13;
of its objectives were agreed with the Government during negotiations (Annex 4.6).&#13;
4.19 TA to Assist Ministry of Autotransport and Municipal Governments. The project&#13;
also provides technical support to the city of Ashghabat in assisting the Department of Planning&#13;
and Architecture in the Mayor of Ashghabat's office with contractual arrangements for APAPO&#13;
and overall monitoring of APAPO's performance and obligations for further privatization of&#13;
urban transport services, training needs and economic evaluation of urban transport investments.&#13;
Technical support will also be provided to the MoAT in furthering reforms in the urban transport&#13;
sector throughout the country, including establishing a system for service contracts between local&#13;
governments and transport enterprises and increasing private sector involvement in the supply of&#13;
transit services and in assessing training needs in the urban transport sector throughout the&#13;
country, including identifying local and foreign training institutes, study tours, etc., for the&#13;
training of urban transport personnel.&#13;
4.20  Training Under the project, the proposed approach is to: (i) tie training initiatives to&#13;
project start-up, the operating and maintenance requirements of the vehicle investments, the&#13;
immediate functional needs of the organizational arrangements in APAPO and the changing&#13;
institutional arrangements of the sector; (ii) introduce senior officials and managers of APAPO,&#13;
the cities, MoAT and the transport companies to international management practices in urban&#13;
transport to sensitize them to options for change and the role of management and staff training in&#13;
the process. Provision has been made under the project (US$0.3 million) for the training of&#13;
urban transport sector managerial and operational staff.&#13;
COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.21  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at about&#13;
US$38.3 million, with an estimated foreign cost of about US$37.0 million or about 97% of total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.23  Physical contingencies of 10 percent for foreign and 15 percent for local costs have been&#13;
applied to all project components. Price escalation adjustments based on the Bank's project of&#13;
the index of manufacturers unit value (muv), as of May 1996, have been applied to the cost of all&#13;
imported goods and services. Local costs, consisting predominantly of non-tradable goods and&#13;
services have been escalated at 25 percent per annum. The total project costs are estimated based&#13;
on an overall implementation of five years.&#13;
4.24  The cost estimates are based on the following: (i) new urban transport vehicles:&#13;
quotations received from major vehicle manufacturers; (ii) vehicle rehabilitation: recent rates&#13;
for similar services in the FSU; (iii) spare parts: quotations received from major manufacturers;&#13;
(iv) workshop, computers and other tools and equipment: based on unit costs for tools and&#13;
equipment derived from recent Bank experience; (v) OIP-related investments: based on unit&#13;
costs for equipment, material and services derived from recent Bank experience; (vi) technical&#13;
assistance and consulting services: actual man-month rates for similar services in the region.&#13;
FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.25  The proposed Bank loan of US$34.2 million would finance about 89 percent of total&#13;
project costs and 93 percent of foreign costs.  As discussed in project description, the&#13;
Government would finance: (a) a mobile charging unit and equipment for CNG/diesel buses; (b)&#13;
the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses including labor and utilities costs; (c) an agreed-upon&#13;
replenishment of spare parts inventory; and (d) the additional works, furnishing and office&#13;
equipment for the establishment of APAPO. The operating companies would finance: (a) works&#13;
and materials for the workshop; and (b) the incremental operating costs associated with&#13;
additional vehicles. The cities of Mary and Chardjou are expected to contribute 100% of the&#13;
local costs.&#13;
4.26 It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to the Govermment which will pass on the loan&#13;
to the municipalities, the newly-formed APAPO and the operating companies. A schematic&#13;
diagram of the proposed legal structure governing the proposed loan is provided in Figure 4.1.&#13;
The execution of an Administration Agreement between the Borrower, the municipality of&#13;
Ashghabat and APAPO, containing all substantive provisions of the Action Plan and project&#13;
implementation arrangements is a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.27 The municipal governments of Ashghabat Mary and Chardjou, the Ministry of&#13;
Autotransport, and APAPO will have overall responsibility for implementing the project. Figure&#13;
4.2 presents a diagram of the project's implementation arrangements, which are described in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
4.28 Role of COM. Within the COM, the Deputy Chairman for International Financial&#13;
Relations has the statutory responsibility for monitoring all international loans and obligations,&#13;
ensuring their effective use. The Deputy Chairman for International Financial Relations would&#13;
be responsible for final approval of purchases made under the proposed Urban Transport Project.&#13;
An administrative unit for international financial relations, the Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU), reports to the Deputy Chairman, International Financial Relations. The PIU has the&#13;
administrative responsibility for monitoring implementation of loan-financed (multilateral and&#13;
bilateral) projects, including institutional-building technical assistance (IBTA) loans.&#13;
4.29 Role of Municipal Government of Ashghabat. The ownership of all public transport&#13;
vehicles in the city is vested with the municipality of Ashghabat. The city has the overall&#13;
responsibility to: .(a) provide general policy guidance on local objectives; (b) approve APAPO&#13;
service plan; and (c) appoint transport operating enterprises management. In addition, the city&#13;
would define, in a timely manner, the financial parameters under which APAPO is to operate and&#13;
make payments to APAPO to cover the costs of operations as agreed in the city's budget and&#13;
plan. The municipality will be supported by an inter-agency committee, with the Mayor of City&#13;
as the Chairman, and with representatives from the Ministries of Autotransport and Economy and&#13;
Finance.&#13;
4.30 Role of APAPO. As part of the agreements reached during project preparation,&#13;
Ashghabat Passenger Autotransport Production Organization (APAPO) is established to develop&#13;
and manage an efficient and cost effective public transport system. APAPO has the following&#13;
major functions: (a) planning the public transport service network in the city; (b) procuring the&#13;
planned services in the most cost efficient manner; (c) monitoring and enforcing the quality of&#13;
service provided by each of the operating enterprises; and (d) developing the efficiency of service&#13;
providers APAPO would be headed by a General Director who will be supported by: (a) Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                 Chapter IV&#13;
Management Group (PMG) headed by a director and two deputy directors (in the functional&#13;
areas of administration and operations/procurement); and (b) Operations Support Group (OSG)&#13;
constituted by: two deputy general-directors in the functional areas of maintenance and&#13;
finance/economic; other specialists in the areas of legal, personnel and sociology/computers.&#13;
Figure 4.3 presents a chart of the proposed APAPO organizational arrangements. The PMG is&#13;
the administrative wing of APAPO, with its principal focus on the procurement of goods and&#13;
services and the development and maintenance of project accounts, including the Special&#13;
Account. The OSG is the techincal group with the principal responsibility to develop, monitor,&#13;
and enforce effective management approaches to improve delivery of transport in Ashghabat in&#13;
an economically-financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner. APAPO is an&#13;
independent legal entity, with control vested with the Municipality of Ashghabat. Key staff of&#13;
APAPO and its subordinate units have been appointed. All appointments of key staff will&#13;
require prior review by the Bank.&#13;
4.31 Bid Evaluation Committee. The PMG will be supported by a bid evaluation committee,&#13;
a technical group established to evaluate bidding documents for procurement of new vehicles and&#13;
spare parts under the project. The principal objective of the Committee will be to evaluate&#13;
proposals and bids for the components financed under the loan. The Committee will consist of&#13;
APAPO General Director, PMG Director, technical representatives of MoAT, representatives of&#13;
the three operating enterprises, and an expatriate consultant. The recommendations of the&#13;
Committee will be sent for approval to the municipality. The service contract between each&#13;
municipality and APAPO will include a provision defining the bid evaluation clearance process,&#13;
as well as the responsibilities of all members of the Committee. The execution of the&#13;
procurement contracts will be concluded by the Deputy Chairman for International Financial&#13;
Relations, COM. During negotiations, the establishment of a Bid Evaluation Committee, with&#13;
description of participating members and their specific functions, was agreed upon with the&#13;
Government.&#13;
4.32  Transport Operating Enterprises.  The three transport operating enterprises (bus,&#13;
trolleybus, and minibus) and capital repair facility in Ashghabat, and transport enterprises in&#13;
Mary and Chardjou are autonomous units, legally and financially independent, under a&#13;
performance contract with APAPO, to achieve a set of pre-specified objectives. The principal&#13;
objective of the enterprises would be to: (a) provide the transport services as agreed at agreed&#13;
level of service; (b) maintain safe vehicles and operations; and (c) develop their professional&#13;
competence and management information systems. Each enterprise would have a manager,&#13;
responsible for daily operations of their respective fleet. Evidence was provided by the&#13;
Government, during negotiations, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that each transport&#13;
enterprise is an independent legal entity with it's own management andfinancial accounting&#13;
systems.&#13;
4.33  Agreements were reached during negotiations on the execution of the following contracts&#13;
as a condition of loan effectiveness (a) service contract between the municipality of Ashghabat&#13;
and APAPO; and (b) performance contract between APAPO and each of the transport enterprises&#13;
in the municipality of Ashghabat.&#13;

4.36 The rehabilitation component provides for the rehabilitation of 60 Ikarus diesel buses, 21&#13;
Laz buses, 34 trolleybuses and 33 minibuses plus modification program of 101 minibuses.&#13;
Procurement for spare parts for the rehabilitation of vehicles and replenishment of spare parts&#13;
inventories will be through ICB (for an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million) through slice and&#13;
packaging, international shopping (up to US$400,000 per contract with an aggregate value of&#13;
US$2.6 million ), national shopping (up to US$50,000 per contract with an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.3 million), and direct contracting (aggregate amount of US$0.7 million) because of their&#13;
availability from only one source.&#13;
4.37 Workshop, computer and other tools and equipment will be procured under ICB (for an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.8 million) through slice and packaging, international shopping&#13;
(US$0.9 million) and national shopping (US$0.1 million). In addition, the proposed OIP-related&#13;
investment components (automatic vehicle location and monitoring and fare collection system)&#13;
will be procured following ICB procedures (US$2.2 million).&#13;
4.38  Procurement for the component for the participation of other cities is estimated to include&#13;
US$4.5 million for ICB procurement of buses. Spare parts for vehicle rehabilitation and&#13;
replenishment of inventories will be procured by international shopping (US$0.9 million),&#13;
national shopping (US$0.1 million) and direct contracting (US$ 0.1 million).&#13;
4.39 Works. Rehabilitation works will be carried out in-house given the absence of local&#13;
private workshops for rehabilitation of vehicles and the difficulty and expense of moving&#13;
vehicles to rehabilitation plants in other countries. Some minor works for the workshop and&#13;
APAPO's offices will be also carried out locally.&#13;
4.40 Technical Assistance and Training. Specialists to be engaged to provide technical and&#13;
operational support to APAPO for the implementation of the project are proposed to be recruited&#13;
as a team from one firm. The firm would be selected from a short list of firms in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (1981). A short-list of firms has been&#13;
agreed upon with the Government and consists of consulting firms with demonstrated and&#13;
extensive prior experience in providing: (i) procurement services in the procurement of vehicles,&#13;
spare parts and other goods and services defined under the project; (ii) advising on technical,&#13;
managerial and national urban transport policy issues; (iii) management of vehicle rehabilitation&#13;
projects; and (iv) the conduct of technical and economic studies in the urban transport sector.&#13;
Contracts for training and other technical services will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (including possibility of sole sourcing).&#13;
4.41  Contract Review. The likely contracts under the project and their expected timing are&#13;
presented in Annex 4.4. All packages for procurement under ICB would be subject to the Bank's&#13;
prior review of procurement documentation. Apart from the first contract award, all contracts&#13;
procured under International Shopping procedure would be subjected to post review.&#13;
Furthermore, and-irrespective of the contract value, the following would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review and approval: (a) all terms of reference for all consultants' contracts; (b) all procurement&#13;
documentation for contracts for assignments judged to be of a critical nature by the Bank; (c) all&#13;
amendments of contracts; and (d) all DC contracting.&#13;

DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.42 The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the following basis: (a) goods: 100% of&#13;
foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs), 85% of local expenditures&#13;
for other items procured locally; and (b) consultants' services, technical assistance and&#13;
training: 100% of expenditures. All disbursement claims would be fully documented, except&#13;
for contracts for consultant and technical services, costing less than (a) US$100,000 with regard&#13;
to contracts with consulting firms; and (b) US$50,000 with regard to contracts with individuals,&#13;
which would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs), and except for contracts&#13;
for goods costing less than US$400,000, with the exception of: (a) goods under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of ICB; (b) the first contract for goods awarded on the basis of international&#13;
shopping procedures; and (c) all contracts for goods awarded under DC. The documentation for&#13;
these expenditures would be retained by the PMG of APAPO for at least one year after receipt by&#13;
the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This&#13;
documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and the Bank upon their&#13;
request. Figure 4.4 outlines the loan withdrawal cycle proposed under the project.&#13;
4.43  The project has been designed for implementation in five years which is the World&#13;
Bank's standard disbursement profile for the ECA Region for full disbursement of the loan. The&#13;
estimated disbursement schedule and chart are given in Annex 4.5. The table below presents the&#13;
categories and arnounts to be financed out of the IBRD loan and the percentage to be financed&#13;
under each category.&#13;

4.44 The Special Account (SA) would be established, in US dollars, by the Borrower in the&#13;
Turkmenistan State Bank for Economic Affairs (Mesheconom Bank) in Ashghabat on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation of the Special Account would be&#13;
US$500,000, representing the estimated average expenditures to be paid from the SA over a&#13;
four-month period. The initial amount deposited would be US$200,000, but this amount would&#13;
be further increased to the maximum authorized allocation once the level of disbursement has&#13;
reached US$3.0 million. The Mesheconom Bank is capable of meeting the requirements of the&#13;
Bank with respect to operating and maintaining the SA. The Mesheconom Bank: (a) is&#13;
financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as audited by an internationally&#13;
recognized auditing firm; (b) has a significant foreign correspondence network covering all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

major currencies; (c) has reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for&#13;
making direct foreign payments and other international transactions with appropriate&#13;
arrangements for the training and development of its staff; (d) is capable of performing a wide-&#13;
range of local banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks,&#13;
issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance&#13;
of adequate accounts for the SA; (e) is a member of Swift and uses or plans to use this facility to&#13;
expedite payment transfers; (f) is willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure the amounts&#13;
deposited in the SA would not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts due to&#13;
the Bank by the Borrower; (g) is willing to maintain adequate accounts as required by the Bank&#13;
and to provide to the Bank monthly bank statements and any other information considered&#13;
necessary by the Bank (copies of all transactions would be routinely submitted to the&#13;
implementing agencies); and (h) is willing to charge reasonable rates for its services and pay&#13;
reasonable interest on balances held from time to time.&#13;
REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
4.45  Accounts and Audits. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all&#13;
other project-related accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting&#13;
standards (IAS). Audits will also be carried out for corresponding periods, in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made&#13;
out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference will be made in the audit reports accompanying&#13;
the financial statements. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following&#13;
accounting disclosure and auditing requirements: (a) for the period up to June 30, 1998,&#13;
APAPO and transport companies will submit to the Bank, on a quarterly basis, no later than&#13;
four weeks after the end of the relevant quarter, its income statements and balance sheets&#13;
based on Turkmenistan accounting standards extant and APAPO's accounting policies; (b)&#13;
for subsequent periods, APAPO and transport companies will submit (i)) annual accounts,&#13;
based on MAS, and audited by an accounting firm, satisfactory to the Bank and under terms of&#13;
engagement satisfactory to the Bank, within six months of the end of the relevant fiscal year;&#13;
(ii) quarterly project accounts to be submitted within four weeks of the end of the relevant&#13;
quarter starting from October 1, 1997 and audited annual project accounts, including the&#13;
auditor's opinion on the use of the Special Account and statement of expenses as described&#13;
above, the adequacy of international controls in the management of loan funds and&#13;
compliance with project covenants; the audited project accounts to be submitted within six&#13;
months of the end of relevantfiscalyear, starting with fiscalyear 1997.&#13;
4.46  Semi-annual progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by the&#13;
project cities and APAPO and sent to the Bank within six weeks after the end of each six-month&#13;
period. These reports will include: (a) progress achieved against agreed implementation and&#13;
disbursement schedules, including number of contracts for goods and vehicle rehabilitation&#13;
works awarded, number of buses and quantity of spare parts delivered, number of urban transport&#13;
vehicles rehabilitated, and project monitorable targets and performance indicators; and (b) work&#13;
programs and cost estimates for the coming six months and for the total project. The main&#13;
purpose of the reports will be to provide timely and updated information on implementation of&#13;
project components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IV                                                                 39&#13;
commenting on progress in resolving previous recommendations. The project will be monitored&#13;
according to project monitoring indicators (Annex 4.6). Agreement has been reached with the&#13;
Government on the Performance Monitoring Indicators. Upon completion of the project,&#13;
APAPO will also prepare an evaluation report on the project's execution.&#13;
4.47 There will be three supervision missions in FY98, two in FY99, two in FY2000, and two&#13;
in FY2001. Each mission will be for about two weeks. Most missions would be staffed by an&#13;
urban transport specialist and an economist/financial analyst, and other specialists such as an&#13;
institutional analyst, procurement expert, vehicle maintenance specialist, training expert or&#13;
transport industry specialist, as required. Missions would review the physical components of the&#13;
project and implementation of reform programs including all the institutional and policy-&#13;
development measures proposed under the project and agree on remedial measures. The mission&#13;
reviews would be done in the context of agreed targets. Details of the supervision plan are given&#13;
in Annex 4.7.&#13;
4.48  A mid-term project review involving the World Bank and relevant Borrower agencies&#13;
will take place in September 1998. The objective of the review will be to assess: (a) overall&#13;
progress of project implementation including buses and trolleybuses procurement and&#13;
distribution of spare parts, technical assistance and training; and (b) the extent to which APAPO&#13;
and other participating cities have met the conditions of the project components. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the scope and timing of the&#13;
mid-term review. The report will be reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1998.&#13;
4.49 The project completion date is June 30, 2001 and the loan closing date would be&#13;
December 31, 2001 to allow sufficient time for any remaining disbursements to be made.&#13;
4.50 Project Launch Workshop. Detailed discussions on project implementation were held&#13;
with the APAPO General Director during negotiations. Follow-up discussions focusing mainly&#13;
on completion of the implementation of the reform program and the selection of other&#13;
participating cities will take place during the Project Launch Workshop, to be held within two&#13;
months of loan approval. Important constraints to effective implementation of the project and&#13;
reform programs will be reviewed and discussed, and responsibilities for implementation will be&#13;
confirmed.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.51  The Bank determined that the project requires a "Category B" rating, as defined in the&#13;
Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), since it is not expected&#13;
to have any significant negative environmental impact.&#13;
4.52 Automotive Urban Air Pollution. The new diesel-powered buses to be financed under&#13;
the project will have engines that will be certified in conformance with the following emissions&#13;
standards for heavy-duty engines: UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), EURO-I,&#13;
and will be less polluting than the gasoline-powered buses in operation today. Moreover, the&#13;
Government of Turkmenistan is now drafting a law which will take into account some of the&#13;
UNECE Regulations concerning engines. The city of Ashghabat is also looking for donor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                 Chapter IV&#13;
assistance to develop a special program to protect the environment of the city. The President has&#13;
also issued a decree to convert part of the road transport fleet to CNG fuel, resulting in less&#13;
atmospheric pollution. In addition, implementation of OIP involving, among other things,&#13;
improved maintenance practices and annual inspection programs would reduce energy&#13;
consumption by about 15 to 20 percent.  This would reduce the gaseous emissions&#13;
proportionately.&#13;
4.53  Replacement of the bus fleet and changes in its composition would not have a major&#13;
effect on the overall average level of atmospheric pollution in Turkmenistan. Buses do not&#13;
account for very much of transport emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrous dioxide (NO2),&#13;
the bulk of these pollutants being generated by trucks. A more important effect of the project&#13;
would result from reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and&#13;
lower peak concentrations of these pollutants in traffic congested urban areas. Characteristics of&#13;
diesel fuel will be accounted for in technical specifications for diesel engines for the buses to be&#13;
procured under the project. Suppliers will be requested to furnish recommendations for proper&#13;
maintenance of the engines when operating on diesel fuels available in Turkmenistan so that&#13;
engine performance and durability are not reduced.&#13;
4.54  Fuel economy data from transport companies will be used as an easily monitorable&#13;
environmental performance indicator throughout the project implementation period, as a proxy&#13;
for assessing reductions in total emissions of specific substances (provided the vehicle model-&#13;
specific exhaust characteristics and fuel composition are known variables). Bank-financed buses&#13;
are expected to be considerably more fuel efficient than the present fleet of buses in&#13;
Turkmenistan.&#13;
4.55  Noise Reduction and Waste Disposal. Urban transport is known to be the major source&#13;
of audible noise in all cities, independent of their size. Motor vehicles account for much of the&#13;
zones of acoustic discomfort in cities. New transit vehicles would also be less noisy. In&#13;
addition, the rehabilitation and spare parts for repairs to be financed under the project will help&#13;
improve vehicle maintenance, which will lead to reduced levels of noise of operating vehicles&#13;
(including, in particular, trolleybuses). Another sizable by-product of urban transport operations&#13;
is the accumulation of recyclable (ferrous and non-ferrous metals) and non-recyclable wastes&#13;
(rubber, petroleum products, oil paint, etc.). To support and/or enhance remedial activities&#13;
towards this end, assistance would be provided to the project transit companies to suggest&#13;
methods of limiting harmful effects of the disposal of non-recyclable engine fluids and old tires&#13;
(as a routine garage maintenance component of the vehicle rehabilitation technical assistance&#13;
program).&#13;
&#13;

5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF BUS ENTERPRISES&#13;
5.1   Recent financial performance for bus and trolleybus operations has been discussed&#13;
in Chapter 2.&#13;
FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING STRATEGY AND PROJECTIONS&#13;
5.2   During appraisal, agreement was reached with the Government, the City of&#13;
Ashghabat, APAPO and the transport enterprises on a financial restructuring strategy to&#13;
stem and reverse the deterioration of the transport enterprises' financial performance.&#13;
The objective of the strategy is to improve urban transport financing by instituting&#13;
measures to:  (i) improve the system  for covering operating costs (excluding&#13;
depreciation), including an adequate provision for maintenance of operating and&#13;
infrastructure assets; (ii) change the funding of exemptions; and (iii) improve the&#13;
budgeting system for allocating subsidies for urban transport.&#13;
5.3   To implement the financial restructuring strategy, the Government has prepared&#13;
an Action Plan, as part of its Urban Transport Policy Statement (paras 1.21-22), which&#13;
will involve specific actions in the following key areas:&#13;
(a)   Subsidy Regime.   The proportion of operating costs (excluding&#13;
depreciation) covered by subsidies will be carefully reviewed. First, a&#13;
review of the system used to grant fare exemptions will be completed,&#13;
with a view to identifying opportunities to reduce the budgetary burden on&#13;
the Government by providing transport subsidies only to the most needy.&#13;
Second, a program will be developed for easy identification of the&#13;
exempted passengers, including the issuance of identification cards with&#13;
photographs to those exempted passengers. Third, a system will be&#13;
developed to eliminate the number of people travelling without paying&#13;
fare. Fourth, a system will be developed for Ashghabat under which the&#13;
respective line agencies would pay to the operating companies for persons&#13;
exempted from paying fares. Fifth, the Government will provide for&#13;
annual budget allocations, in advance, for the required city transport&#13;
subsidy from the central state budget to APAPO which will in turn pay the&#13;
subsidies to the operating companies on a quarterly basis.&#13;
(b)   Tariff Increases. With the implementation of the above measures, the&#13;
fare collection system for Ashghabat will be relatively efficient. To&#13;
generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs (excluding&#13;
depreciation), the Government has gradually increased public transport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                    Chapter V&#13;
fares (para 2.15).  To protect the transport enterprises' cash flow from&#13;
erosion by cost increases in inputs and payroll caused by inflation or such&#13;
events outside the enterprises' control, the Government has agreed to&#13;
review tariff increases periodically, based on reviews and recommen-&#13;
dations made by APAPO.&#13;
(c)   Unit Transport Cost Reduction. The cost incurred by the transport&#13;
enterprises per unit of service performed is considerably greater than could&#13;
be achieved with more efficient operations. Through an integrated and&#13;
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses,&#13;
the enterprises' efficiency would be improved. During preparation of the&#13;
Action Plan, the Government and the transport enterprises indicated their&#13;
commitment towards implementing measures to provide adequate&#13;
financing for the repair and maintenance of vehicles and capital&#13;
investments to replace and expand the requirements of the enterprises. The&#13;
effective implementation of these measures constitutes a major means of&#13;
improving the contribution margins earned per unit of service provided by&#13;
the transport enterprises, i.e., of improving the enterprises' profitability.&#13;
5.4   The financial goals will not be effective if: (i) they coexist with contradictory&#13;
policies on subsidies; (ii) a budget allocation system does not provide for the financing of&#13;
subsidies on a timely and predictable basis; (iii) tariff increases are not allowed to be&#13;
adjusted to cover cost increases; and (iv) the transport enterprises, under reasonably cash-&#13;
generative operations, does not invest profits in productive assets and operations. To&#13;
ensure that the financial objectives are realized, during negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached on the subsidy regime, financing mechanisms of countervailing susidies and&#13;
operational efficiency and cost recovery targets. During Project Implementation, the&#13;
Borrower shall: (a) make adequate yearly budget allocations from the central state&#13;
budget for the required subsidy to APAPO; and (b) quarterly payments of said subsidy&#13;
to APAPO.&#13;
5.5   Agreement was reached with the Government on the development of a system,&#13;
by June 30, 1997, under which fares for exempted passengers are paid by the respective&#13;
line agencies/municipality directly to the operating enterprises.&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.6   The transport enterprises' recent financial performance has been discussed in&#13;
Chapter 2.&#13;
5.7   Revenues. Each transport companies' revenues were based on existing supply&#13;
and demand figures as described previously (Chapter 2). The financial model assumes a&#13;
vehicle profile presented in Annex 5.1. The model also assumes that in future: (a) travel&#13;
demand would increase at eight percent per annum in the medium term (in keeping with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                43&#13;
population growth of Ashghabat) and, thereafter, it would stabilize; (b) average trip&#13;
length would remain the same as in the base year; and (c) vehicle availability would&#13;
improve with the implementation of OIP and better maintenance. The operating&#13;
enterprises would get compensated for the fare-exempted-travelling public by an explicit&#13;
payment of subsidies and elimination of people evading fare. This would be achieved&#13;
through: (a) introduction of strict measures to eliminate fare evaders through&#13;
implementation of OIP; and (b) review of the subsidy regime to target specific groups and&#13;
assigning responsibility for explicit payment of subsidies from the municipality and line&#13;
agencies to transport enterprises.  Other critical assumptions used in the financial&#13;
projections are detailed in Annex 5.2.&#13;
5.8   Expenses. Future costs for each of the three transport companies were based on&#13;
existing costs adjusted for projected average vehicle operating costs for newer, more&#13;
reliable, vehicles purchased under the project. Fuel costs per vehicle should decrease as&#13;
new and rehabilitated vehicles will be more fuel-efficient. Tire and maintenance costs are&#13;
assumed to increase from the present levels in order to maintain a reasonable tire&#13;
replacement and vehicle maintenance program for the vehicles.&#13;
5.9   Summary of Results. The impact of the financial restructuring actions on the&#13;
transport enterprises' prospective financial performance has been evaluated and is&#13;
summarized in Table 5.2 below and detailed in Annex 5.3. The financial projections for&#13;
the project are based on the vehicle-operations profile, operating costs and tariff&#13;
assumptions described above and in Annex 5.2. These assumptions were also used in the&#13;
economic evaluation.&#13;
5.10  Table 5.2 illustrates that with an increase in fare structure cost recovery for diesel&#13;
bus is expected to increase to 42 percent in 1997 and to 61 percent for trolleybuses. The&#13;
Government is committed to improving cost recovery targets of minibus operations.&#13;
5.11  Scenario analysis.  The objective of the proposed project is to achieve self-&#13;
sustaining and commercially-viable transport services. This objective depends on the&#13;
operating efficiency objectives of the project being met and the consequential savings in&#13;
operating costs being realized. The financial evaluation focused on two scenarios: (i)&#13;
assuming the fare per trip remains the same in real terms (base case); and (ii) increased&#13;
fare per trip in real terrns to recover operating expenses (excluding depreciation).&#13;
5.12  Under the first scenario, total income would not be sufficent to cover operating&#13;
expenses for bus, trolleybus and minibus operations (as of January 1997 minibus fares&#13;
were reduced from 200 to 50 manats). However, cost recovery would gradually improve&#13;
in future with an increase in vehicle availability and the number of fare-paying&#13;
passengers. For diesel buses, cost recovery would improve from 42% in 1997 to 45% in&#13;
2005 and for trolleybuses, from 61% to 82%, and for minibuses, from 24% to 28% in the&#13;
corresponding years, without any change in the fare structure.&#13;

increase about 24 times (in real terms) from 50 to 118 manats per trip to recover 100% of&#13;
the operating expenses. For trolleybuses, fares would have to increase less than two-fold&#13;
to about 90 manats in order to recover operating expenses For minibuses, fares would&#13;
have to increase more than four times to a little over 200 manats. The justification for&#13;
increasing real fares in future would be far greater with the project since service levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                45&#13;
will be improved with a greater availability of buses. The possibility of a mode shift&#13;
from public transport to other private modes, with an increase in fares, resulting in a&#13;
decline in revenues for buses, is considered unlikely as very few alternatives exist and the&#13;
dependence on public transport systems is expected to continue (available data are&#13;
insufficient to compute price elasticities of demand).&#13;
5.14 Under the circumstances, the Government is faced with a choice of either: (a)&#13;
increasing the fare in real terms sufficient to recover total expenses on vehicle operations;&#13;
or (b) provide budget allocations for the required subsidy to cover the difference between&#13;
a financially viable fare and the actual fare and to ensure a timely replacement of the&#13;
vehicle fleet. The efforts by the Government to raise vehicle fares over the past year have&#13;
been in response to the Social Assessment (SA) which indicated consumer acceptance of&#13;
linking fare increases to better cost recovery and improved services. The willingness to&#13;
pay on the part of the people for improved services was clearly demonstrated in the SA.&#13;
5.15  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government for revenues&#13;
from transit services to cover 100 percent of operating costs, excluding depreciation, by&#13;
the end of 1999.&#13;
5.16  Urban Passenger Transport Investments. To protect against the risk of inefficient&#13;
investments, agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations on: (a) the&#13;
carrying out by the Municipality of Ashghabat, under terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, of studies on urban passenger transport investments, and the completion and&#13;
furnishing to the Bank of studies containing the findings and recommendations before&#13;
commencement of such investments; and (b) exchange views with the Bank on the&#13;
recommendations with a view to determining an appropriate order of priority for transport&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.1   Project Objective and Description. The objective of the project is to improve&#13;
the bus transport (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) service in Ashghabat in terms of:&#13;
(a)   quality of service, by reducing waiting time and crowding while increasing&#13;
service reliability;&#13;
(b)   quantity of service, by satisfying the increasing demand reflecting eight&#13;
percent annual population growth in Ashghabat in the medium term, plus&#13;
the pent-up demand in currently under- and unserved areas in Ashghabat;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   efficiency, by reducing transport unit costs through an integrated and&#13;
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses&#13;
supported by a broad program to eliminate specific shortcomings and&#13;
weaknesses identified in different operational areas.&#13;
6.2  It is against this background that the proposed project includes the following three&#13;
components for which an economic analysis has been undertaken:&#13;
(a)   Component 1. Technical Assistance  to strengthen institutional and&#13;
financial capacity of public transport operators and to implement an&#13;
Operations Improvement Plan (OIP). The OIP includes preparation of&#13;
optimal routing plans, driving training and control, vehicle maintenance&#13;
practices, services standards, service monitoring, and bus and trolleybus&#13;
terminal management;&#13;
(b)   Component 2. Maintenance and Rehabilitation. This component includes&#13;
upgrading maintenance facilities and equipment, rehabilitation and&#13;
refurbishment of diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus facilities, including&#13;
procurement of parts needed for major repairs and rehabilitation, spare&#13;
parts and tires to replenish inventories, and tools and equipment for&#13;
garages. The purpose of these investments would be to provide the&#13;
necessary spare parts to put back into operation the vehicle fleet currently&#13;
out of service and augment the capacity of garages to provide periodic&#13;
maintenance; and&#13;
(c)   Component 3. Purchase of New Buses. Purchase of new diesel and&#13;
trolleybuses to improve service delivery, extend transport services to&#13;
currently unserved outlying areas, and set in place new procurement&#13;
procedures as established by Bank guidelines to ensure efficient delivery&#13;
of vehicles in future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                                                 Chapter VI&#13;
6.3   Methodology. The economic benefits resulting from investments in each of the&#13;
three modes (diesel bus, trolleybus, and minibus) are determined by comparing the "with"&#13;
case with the "without" case. The benefits have been calculated for: (a) investments in all&#13;
three components for each of the modes; and (b) investments in OIP and maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation program (excluding the capital cost of new purchases). The "without"&#13;
project case reflects the strategy that in the future unserviceable buses will be promptly&#13;
replaced by Government on an annual basis, a strategy that the Government has been&#13;
following in the past few years. A major difference in the "without" case would be that&#13;
Government would continue to make sub-optimal purchases of new vehicles based on its&#13;
ability to barter vehicles for natural gas or petroleum products. As a result, servicability&#13;
of vehicles would continue to be low. In addition, in the "without" case, vehicle&#13;
availability would be low because of poor operational practices, fragmented institutional&#13;
responsibilities, weak fiscal base, and inadequate maintenance. In the "with" case,&#13;
because of institutional reforms, implementation of OIP, rehabilitation of vehicles, and&#13;
emphasis on cost recovery, it would be possible to improve the servicability ratio and&#13;
operating environment, resulting in availability of a larger vehicle fleet on any day, which&#13;
would result in improved speed, lower waiting time, and better access for all residents of&#13;
the city. The proposed project would rehabilitate a large number of existing buses,&#13;
improving their operating life from the existing five to six years to about twelve years.&#13;
The benefits would translate into time savings for the commuting public. The cost to&#13;
make this possible would include: technical assistance; investments in spare parts,&#13;
workshop, tools and equipment; incremental operating costs; and investments in the&#13;
purchase of additional vehicles.&#13;
6.4  In view of the highly uncertain and volatile nature of pricing in Turkmenistan, the&#13;
calculation of point economic rates of return is not very meaningful. Of greater validity,&#13;
therefore, is the calculation of switching values, or the value at which NPV becomes zero&#13;
(or the IRR equals the discount rate). Each of the variable inputs is varied over a range&#13;
to establish the threshold beyond which the variable becomes a critical variable.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS, BENEFITS AND RETURNS&#13;
6.5   Project Costs. The project costs include: (a) technical assistance. The technical&#13;
assistance component, at an estimated base cost of US$1.3 million (including US$0.3&#13;
million for the establishment of Project Management Group), will help implement OIP,&#13;
assist PMG with the implementation of the project and the procurement of goods and&#13;
services, assist APAPO with the introduction of improved systems and practices for&#13;
management of all aspects of urban transport operations in the participating cities, and&#13;
assist municipal government and Ministry of Road Transport to further reforms in the&#13;
urban transport sector.  The economic analysis for each of the three modes is based on&#13;
the assumption that about 70 percent of the TA is for diesel buses and 15 percent each for&#13;
trolleybuses and minibuses. (b) Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The base cost of this&#13;
component includes: US$1.9 million for equipment, tools and parts to rehabilitate 81&#13;
buses, US$1.1 million to rehabilitate 34 trolleybuses, and US$0.6 million to rehabilitate&#13;
33 minibuses; US$1.6 million for spare parts, workshop, computers and other tools and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VI                                                                   49&#13;
equipment for diesel buses, US$0.6 million for trolley buses, and US$0.4 million for&#13;
minibuses. In addition US$2.0 million is estimated for implementing OIP which would&#13;
include improving the vehicle monitoring and fare collection system. (c) incremental&#13;
operating cost. The cost of operating additional vehicle fleet with the project is estimated&#13;
at US$1.0 million. (d) purchase of new buses. The project includes the purchase of 52&#13;
twelve meter diesel buses and 10 CNG/diesel (US$7.6 million) and 40 twelve meter&#13;
trolleybuses (US$6.4 million).&#13;
6.6   Benefits and Returns. The benefits of the proposed investments are computed in&#13;
terms of savings in trip time resulting from higher speed, lower waiting times, improved&#13;
headways, and easier access to public transport because of the availability of a greater&#13;
number of vehicles operating at higher efficiency as compared to the without project&#13;
case . Table 6.1 below shows the economic rate of return and net present value for each&#13;
of the three modes (both with and without investments for the purchase of the new fleet).&#13;
The rate of return for the project (including purchase of the new vehicle fleet) is&#13;
considerable, although, as expected, the returns increase significantly when the capital&#13;
cost of new vehicles is excluded. However, eventually new equipment will have to be&#13;
purchased. The most significant benefit of new vehicles is the inducement it has given&#13;
the Government to undertake key reforms in urban transport, the benefit of which will&#13;
extend far longer than the life of the project.&#13;

Note: Figures in parentheses show the net present values (NPV), in US$ million.&#13;
6.7   Switching Value Analysis. The switching value for each of the significant&#13;
variables is the value at which the project's NPV becomes zero (or the IRR equals the&#13;
discount rate). Switching values are computed as the percentage change in the value of&#13;
the variable needed to turn the Project's NPV equal to zero and help identify the variables&#13;
which most affect project outcomes. The switching values of the relatively more&#13;
important variables are presented in order of declining sensitivity in Table 6.2 below.&#13;
Value of time is computed by considering yearly person income of US$700 and assuming that time&#13;
savings resulting from improved operations "with" the project are perceived at 35 percent of income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50                                                                 Chapter VI&#13;
Table 6.2: Presentation of Switching Values&#13;
Variable                           Switching Value&#13;
Non-availability of spare parts and&#13;
inadequate maintenance beyond project life    -15%&#13;
Delay in implementation of OIP                -25%&#13;
Cost of new vehicle fleet                     30%&#13;
Per capita income                             -35%&#13;
Growth in passenger demand                    -70%&#13;
The most critical variable in this project is that institutional and cost recovery reforms&#13;
will not be implemented as promised. If these reforms are not implemented, availability&#13;
rates of new buses would again start declining beyond two years because of the lack of&#13;
spare parts and fleet replacement, and spare parts would once again decline because of the&#13;
aging fleet--a decrease of more than 15 percent in the availability of resources for spare&#13;
parts and maintenance beyond the initial two years will make the NPV negative, if other&#13;
things remain as expected. The next critical variable is the timely implementation of&#13;
OIP. A delay in implementation of OIP sufficient to reduce vehicle availability by more&#13;
than 25 percent will make the NPV negative. The analysis also indicates that the&#13;
assumed annual eight percent growth in passenger demand is not critical to the success of&#13;
the project--even if annual demand grows by about two-and-a-half percent, the&#13;
investments will yield a positive return. The per capita income would have to decrease&#13;
by more than 35 percent for the savings in time to be exceeded by the proposed size of&#13;
investments.&#13;
6.8   Other Benefits. The project will result in a number of other benefits, difficult to&#13;
quantify. First, improvement in institutional arrangements will enhance efficiency of&#13;
public transport enterprises in providing transport services. Second, the project, through&#13;
improved cost recovery, will reduce subsidies to public transport enterprise, which at&#13;
present pose a severe burden on city finances. Third, the project puts in place rational&#13;
procurement policies and procedures for acquisition of new buses and spare parts.&#13;
Fourth, the project supports the creation of an enabling environment for active&#13;
participation by the private sector. Fifth, improved public transport services would&#13;
enhance access to job opportunities for all residents, but especially for low-income&#13;
residents in the outlying districts, and therefore would result in improving living&#13;
conditions for the population. Sixth, improved operational practices, better scheduling&#13;
and routing would encourage a more balanced modal shift.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter VI                                                               51&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.9   A major risk of the project is that the proposed reforms, especially the&#13;
institutional cost recovery reforms, will not be implemented as promised. If these&#13;
reforms are not implemented, the new buses and spare parts financed under the loan&#13;
would only give temporary relief. Availability rates of vehicles would once again decline&#13;
because of the lack of spare parts and fleet replacement, and vehicle maintenance costs&#13;
would increase because of the aging fleet. To mitigate this risk, the project includes&#13;
conditions regarding key institutional reforms and financial performance.  These&#13;
conditions include:&#13;
(a)   establishment of APAPO  as a legally and financially independent&#13;
organization (para 4.17),&#13;
(b)   signing of a contract between the municipality of Ashghabat and APAPO&#13;
to perform transport services (para 4.27);&#13;
(c)   implementation of short term measures included in the OIP (para 4.19);&#13;
(d)   agreement to explicitly  provide budget allocations for the required&#13;
subsidy one year in advance (para 5.4); and&#13;
(e)   increasing cost recovery to 40% by effectiveness (para 2.23).&#13;
6.10  Once the companies receive the new buses and trolleybuses they should be able to&#13;
increase cost recovery even more with the substantially improved level of service.&#13;
6.11  A second risk is that once the project is completed the urban transport companies&#13;
will still not have sufficient funds for the purchase of spare parts and replacement of the&#13;
fleet, even with improved cost recovery achieved under the project. Project companies&#13;
will have to compete with other priority sectors to secure adequate subsidies from local&#13;
government which could come under increasing financial pressure over the next few&#13;
years. Given the uncertainty over future levels of funding, the project will:&#13;
(a)   set a target of 100 percent cost recovery (excluding depreciation) by&#13;
December 31, 1999;&#13;
(b)   require the introduction of contracts between the municipal government&#13;
and project companies guaranteeing payment of subsidies based on&#13;
performance standards; and&#13;
(c)   introduce privatization of urban transport services to reduce public funding&#13;
requirements.&#13;
6.12  A third risk is that there will be delays in project execution. To reduce this risk,&#13;
the bidding documents for purchase of new vehicles have substantially been agreed with&#13;
the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                                                                Chapter VI&#13;
6.13  A fourth risk is that the assumed 8 percent growth in total travel demand per&#13;
annum may not materialize. The switching values analysis has already demonstrated that&#13;
the growth in travel demand is not a critical variable. However, the travel demand of 8&#13;
percent (based on an equivalent city population growth rate) is considered to be on the&#13;
conservative side as it does not include the 'latent" and "diverted" demand. With an&#13;
improvement in public transport services, people in the outlying zones, who currently&#13;
walk to their destination, would potentially become public transport users; a number of&#13;
people who currently have no choice but to depend on private transport would&#13;
additionally use public transport, if services are improved. Improvements in affordable&#13;
public transport services would also improve access to job opportunities, expanding the&#13;
labor force, and the resulting demand for public transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 1.1&#13;
URBAN TRANSPORT POLICY STATEMENT AND ACTION PLAN&#13;
1.    The following urban policy statement and Action Plan has been approved by the&#13;
Government and agreed with the Bank.&#13;
2.    Urban residents account for 44 percent of the country's total population, and their&#13;
numbers are growing rapidly. In specific terms, since Turkmenistan gained independence&#13;
in 1991, the population of Ashghabat has been growing at a rate of 8 percent per year, and&#13;
now accounts for 12 percent of the total population. It is expected that the current rates of&#13;
population growth will continue in the near future, and may even rise.&#13;
3.    The production and social activity of the population of the city of Ashghabat and&#13;
the country's other major urban centers depends to a significant extent on public&#13;
transport. In light of the rapid population growth, changes in the population's economic&#13;
activities, and widespread reliance on public transport, a well-organized and efficient&#13;
transportation system is a key element in ensuring that:&#13;
*  limitations curtailing the mobility of the population and work force do not hinder&#13;
the development of production and commercial activity;&#13;
*  the development of new markets and social activity among the population is not&#13;
retarded by inadequate transportation services;&#13;
* the growing population is properly integrated into a city's economic and social&#13;
activity.&#13;
4.    The public transit system in cities, however, has not been able to meet the&#13;
growing demand for transportation services. Since 1991 there has been a significant&#13;
decline in the ability of transportation organizations to serve the population in an&#13;
effective manner. The level of service provided by motor transport organizations is&#13;
uneven, some parts of cities are not served fully, and deficiencies in the transportation&#13;
system have started to have a negative effect on production and commercial activity in&#13;
urban areas. While unofficial and alternative forms of transportation services have&#13;
appeared to supplement services provided by public transportation enterprises, this has&#13;
still not been enough to prevent a sharp decline in the quality and volume of services.&#13;
5.    The Government is currently faced with the following tasks:&#13;
* stopping the deterioration in transportation services provided to the public;&#13;
* improving the situation with regard to covering the costs of bus and trolleybus&#13;
service;&#13;
&#13;

providing additional incentives for the private sector to get involved in offering&#13;
services to the public.&#13;
6.    In order to meet these goals, the Government is planning to carry out an extensive&#13;
program of reforms aimed at eliminating the causes of inadequate service in the passenger&#13;
transport sector. The program, the details of which are spelled out in an attachment to&#13;
this document, includes fundamental reforms to improve the practical organization of&#13;
services and the extent to which the costs of public transport organizations are covered, as&#13;
well as reforms to encourage the private sector's participation in urban transit.&#13;
7.    Program of institutional reforms. At present, responsibility for regulating and&#13;
providing services in the urban transit sector is shared by several organizations, which&#13;
results in poor service and redundancy. Transportation organizations have only general&#13;
instructions to provide services, the goals of which are not clearly defined. Even if these&#13;
goals were specified, transportation organizations would not be able to achieve them&#13;
because of the low fares that are in effect and unreliable state financing for subsidies.&#13;
The experience of other countries shows that urban transit services can be more efficient&#13;
and better coordinated if all public services provided are under the control of a single&#13;
independent authority, which is accountable to the given municipality. To provide a&#13;
better framework for organizing the transportation services system, the Government has&#13;
already taken measures to consolidate these services under the municipality of Ashghabat&#13;
and it is setting up an independent Public Transportation Agency, which is to be&#13;
accountable to city authorities. Improvements will be made in the system used to provide&#13;
budget subsidies and finance capital investments for the Transportation Agency, with a&#13;
view to ensuring more reliable financial support for the Agency, better accountability,&#13;
and more efficient use of government funds for transportation agencies. This will mean&#13;
moving away from the subsidy system in which subsidies are determined after losses&#13;
have been incurred, and toward a system under which subsidies are determined each year&#13;
in advance. Subsidies will be based on a transportation company's achievement of goals&#13;
that have been agreed upon and on fares charged, as part of an annual contractual&#13;
agreement to provide a city with transportation services. The transportation company in&#13;
question will take all possible measures to reduce costs and improve the quality of service&#13;
by preparing and implementing a plan to improve operations on a short-term and long-&#13;
term basis.&#13;
8.    The Government will gradually reduce the role of the Ministry of Motor Transport&#13;
in the operation and management of urban transit in the country and will expand the&#13;
Ministry's role in determining strategy, organizing national investments in transportation,&#13;
identifying budget priorities, providing guidance to city authorities in the area of&#13;
transportation planning and budgets, and monitoring urban transit services.&#13;
9.    Covering costs. The Government has taken significant steps in liberalizing&#13;
public transport fares. The bus fares have progressively increased over the past two&#13;
years, from .05 manats per trip in January, 1995 to 50 manats in December, 1996 for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1                                                               59&#13;
diesel and trolleybuses. As a result, cost recovery for diesel and trolleybuses has&#13;
improved from about two percent at the beginning of project preparation to more than 25&#13;
percent.&#13;
10.   The Government is going to take measures to improve the system for covering the&#13;
costs of urban transit services, and it is going to act to close any gaps in the fare&#13;
collection system, raise fares, and protect subsidies.&#13;
11.   Privatization of transportation services. The Government has already taken&#13;
measures to privatize minivans and taxis by leasing them to drivers and allowing them to&#13;
keep a share of the profits, after a certain monthly payment has been made, including the&#13;
cost of maintaining the vehicles. The Government has also opened up a wide range of&#13;
opportunities for the private sector to participate in providing transportation services and&#13;
it is currently studying issues related to making the necessary changes in the system to&#13;
draw more of the private sector into the market. A presidential decree (No. 2702) was&#13;
issues on July 1, 1996, to privatize part of the taxi fleet in Ashghabat.&#13;

ANNEX 2.1&#13;
ASHGHABAT: URBAN TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
1.    Ashghabat, the nation's capital, is the largest urban center with a population of&#13;
500,000 (about 25 percent of the national urban population), followed by Charjev&#13;
(180,000), Mary (167,000), Dashkovuz (140,000), Nebitag (109,000), and Turkmenbashi&#13;
(64,000). The population of Ashghabat has grown at an average annual rate of eight&#13;
percent over the past few years but public investments to maintain and expand transport&#13;
infrastructure and services have lagged behind the rapidly growing demand placed on&#13;
them. This concentration of population and economic activities in the city places a severe&#13;
constraint on the transport infrastructure. Current forecasts indicate that the concentration&#13;
of people and activities in Ashghabat and other urban areas would continue in future,&#13;
placing further demands on the available infrastructure.&#13;
2.    Transport Demand  Characteristics .   Seven    Table 1: Share of Person Trips&#13;
characteristics dominate transport demand in Ashghabat.        by Mode, 1995&#13;
Eirst, like in all FSU countries, public transport has&#13;
traditionally played a dominant role in satisfying mobility    M&#13;
needs in Turkmenistan (Table 1). Of the 560,000 average    Public Transpo      60.3%&#13;
daily person trips in 1995, almost 60 percent use some    Diesel Bus           36.0%&#13;
form  of public transport, while the rest include taxi,    Minibus              7.3%&#13;
private vehicles, and enterprise transport.  The table    Trolley Bus           8.0%&#13;
excludes walk trips, which are about 20 percent of total    Taxi                9.0%&#13;
daily trips. Second, about 50 percent of the trips using    Private Transpo    39.7%&#13;
public transport vehicle are work trips, 10 percent are    Private Car         12.8%&#13;
school trips and the balance 40 percent are shop and social    Enterprise       6.9%&#13;
trips.  Ihkd, on average, trip duration using public    Walk                   20.0%&#13;
transport is 41 minutes (including time to walk to bus stop&#13;
and waiting for a bus). Average waiting for a bus is about    1. Social Assessment Report, 1996&#13;
10 minutes, though it varies considering by the time-of-    2. Soges Final Report, 1995&#13;
the-day. People walking to their destination, on average,&#13;
walk for 19 rminutes and generally work in vicinity of their  I&#13;
residences. Fourth, over the past few years, there is a&#13;
gradual decline in the dependence on public transport from about 90 percent in 1990 to&#13;
60 percent in 1995. Eii, the degree of auto ownership in Ashghabat is low at about I&#13;
for every 4 households, though it is increasing at a fast rate over the past few years.&#13;
Sixth, average household incomes are low, about 7500 manat per month (US$35), of&#13;
Most of the statistics in this section is based on: (a) the Social Assessment Study, conducted in February&#13;
1995, as part of a World Bank mission (see Annex 2.2 for details); and (b) background studies&#13;
prepared by Soges Organizzazione E Gestione in 1995 as part of the preparatory work for this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                                                                   Annex 2.1&#13;
which almost 80 percent is spent on food. Average expenditure on transport varies&#13;
between 7 percent and 12 percent.  Seventh, accessibility to transport services in&#13;
Ashghabat is lower for women as compared to men: 28 percent of women walk to work&#13;
as compared to 14 percent men; 7 percent of women commute by car as compared to 20&#13;
percent men; and 10 percent of women use enterprise transport as compared to 20 percent&#13;
men.&#13;
3.    Transport Supply Characteristics.  Passenger transport demand in Ashghabat&#13;
is served by a multitude of services: buses of varying sizes, trolley buses and taxis--all&#13;
operated by city-based enterprises; and private cars. The inventory of public transport&#13;
vehicles in 1995 indicates low utilization rate for diesel buses and trolley buses--less than&#13;
60 percent of the available vehicle fleet is in operation. It is estimated that over the last&#13;
five years, almost 40 percent of the available fleet of diesel buses and trolley buses have&#13;
been depreciated and junked. The problem has become more acute in the last two years&#13;
because of the difficulties in obtaining spare parts from Russia. The poor condition of&#13;
the existing vehicle fleet is brought out by looking at the age profile (Table 2):&#13;
Table 2: Age Profile of Buses&#13;
(a)   unavailability of spare parts to service and     in Ashghabat&#13;
maintain  buses;  and  (b) the  relatively&#13;
shortened effective operating life of the    Vehicle Average&#13;
vehicle fleet due to accumulated effects of    Type  Age (Yrs)&#13;
inadequate maintenance. The number of mini    LAZ-695    2.6&#13;
buses in operation is high because most of   Ikams-260    7.2&#13;
them have been acquired in the past two years.   Ikarus-280    6.9&#13;
The acquisition of 59 RAF minivans in 1993    Iveco-A60U    1.0&#13;
and  101  Iveco  minibuses in  1994  has    RAF-Minivan  2.0&#13;
considerably strengthened the vehicle fleet and    Taxi  6.1&#13;
has brought down the average life of these    Trolley Bus   6.5&#13;
vehicles in operation. However, these vehicle&#13;
replacements have depended largely on the&#13;
ability of the central government to barter vehicles for natural gas or&#13;
petroleum products and are not based on any planned policy. This system&#13;
of vehicle financing has led to inefficient investments. Minibuses and&#13;
mini vans are operated on heavy demand corridors which are better suited&#13;
for regular size buses. Operation of smaller vehicles has resulted in&#13;
vehicle overcrowding and safety compromises, which is generally a cause&#13;
of discontentment in the traveling public. The Social Assessment Study&#13;
(1995) has clearly brought out the need to replace mini buses with regular&#13;
* size buses along major corridors as one of the issues echoed by most&#13;
respondents. In addition, the city is not adequately equipped to provide the&#13;
servicing needs of these mini buses and minivans. The result is that as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1                                                                75&#13;
available spare parts get exhausted by the end of this year, maintenance of&#13;
the existing fleet is going to become a serious concern.&#13;
4.    The decline in the provision of public transport services in the city has been&#13;
accompanied by an increase in personalized transport modes. In this regards, Ashghabat&#13;
is no different from other cities, where people look for alternative means to satisfy their&#13;
mobility requirements in the face of deteriorating public transport services. The number&#13;
of enterprise taxis and private cars have increased significantly between 1993 and 1994,&#13;
with private cars increasing from 30,997 in 1993 to 34,652 in 1994 (growth rate of 11&#13;
percent) and enterprise taxis increasing from 768 to 1,210 (over 50 percent growth rate)&#13;
during the one year period.&#13;
5.    Public Transport Operations. The major bus operator, The Enterprise of Public&#13;
Transport in the City of Ashghabat No. 3004, under functional tutelage of the Ministry of&#13;
Transport (MOT), claims about 60 percent of the public transport market. Three types of&#13;
buses are operated: Laz-695, with a total carrying capacity of 67, Ikaraus-260, with a&#13;
carrying capacity of 110, and articulated Ikarus-280, with a carrying capacity of 180. The&#13;
diesel bus enterprise employs about 8 staff per operating vehicle. The trolley buses&#13;
(carrying capacity 126), operated by the Ashghabat City Government, account for about&#13;
13 percent of the public transport market, and employs about 12 staff per operating&#13;
vehicle. The overall planning and route specification, introduction of new routes, for&#13;
both diesel buses and trolley buses is done by the City Government. In addition to&#13;
regular buses and trolley buses, mini buses and mini vans are operated by the Ashghabat&#13;
State Passenger Auto Transit Enterprise. under the MOT. Mini buses have a carrying&#13;
capacity of 25, while mini vans are seat-only vehicles with a capacity of 12, and employ&#13;
about 4 people per operating vehicle. The reason for a low staff to minivan ratio is that&#13;
about 60 percent of the available minivan fleet is subcontracted to private individuals,&#13;
who have served for more than five years as drivers (the subcontracting operation was&#13;
started only recently in May, 1995). The basic conditions of subcontracting include:&#13;
(a) driver appear every two weeks in the office of transit enterprise to get the renewal&#13;
documents and make a payment of 9,000 manats (US$40.00) for using the bus; (b) the&#13;
bus be operated for no more than 12 hours each day, of which two hours must be during&#13;
the morning peak period and two hours in the afternoon peak period along specified&#13;
routes; (c) the bus fare during the peak periods is fixed at 5 manat per trip, while the&#13;
driver is free to charge any amount during off-peak operation. In return for this&#13;
operation, the driver is paid a fixed monthly salary, and is provided with fuel and repair&#13;
facilities. The spare parts, oil, batteries, tires have to be paid by the driver. The balance&#13;
40 percent of the minivan fleet is operated on a limited version as a "demand-responsive"&#13;
service, as it operates at fixed fare, along fixed routes but the passengers have the&#13;
flexibility of getting-off at the desired location. Informally, however, Social Assessment&#13;
Study (1995) has shown that the drivers often take detours on payment of higher fares to&#13;
satisfy individual commuters. Taxis are also operated by the MOT and account for less&#13;
than 10 percent of travel market. Other forms of paratransit are not present.&#13;

Route Operations&#13;
6.    Diesel Bus. The city bus network and service measures for diesel buses show&#13;
following characteristics: (a) the bus enterprise operates 29 routes in the city and the area&#13;
distribution of bus lines is aimed at offering a service which covers the entire urban area;&#13;
(b) the greater part of the lines are planimetrically outlined according to a circular route&#13;
(where the departure terminus coincides with the arrival terminus) and are of average&#13;
length of 20 km, varying between a minimum of 12 km and a maximum of 32 km; (c)&#13;
there is a bus stop every 500 to 600 meters along the route; (d) average frequency of bus&#13;
operations is between 3 and 4 buses per hour, or one bus every 15 to 20 minutes; (e)&#13;
average bus speed is 15 to 20 km/hour; (f) on average, buses operate daily for about 150&#13;
km and carry a total of 300,000 passengers daily; (g) on average, buses operate daily for&#13;
about 9 hours.&#13;
*  Mini Bus. The mini bus route network and service measures show the&#13;
following characteristics: (a) mini buses operate on 20 routes which are&#13;
common with regular bus operations; (b) average route length, number of bus&#13;
stops, travel time, and speed are same as for regular buses; (c) average trip&#13;
length for mini buses is also the same as for regular buses; (d) on average,&#13;
buses carry 60,000 persons per day.&#13;
*  Trolley Bus. The trolley bus route network and service measures show the&#13;
following characteristics: (a) trolley buses operate on 7 routes, somewhat&#13;
coincidental with the operation of diesel buses and mini buses; (b) average&#13;
travel time and speed for trolley buses are no different than for buses.&#13;
.&#13;
7.    Constraints in the Operations of Public Transport System. The analysis of route&#13;
network of diesel buses, mini buses, and trolley buses indicates that: (a) the three modes&#13;
serve the same areas, following the same route pattern, often in competition with each&#13;
other. Each of the three modes has distinct advantages, which are not fully realized as&#13;
they all follow the same routes, without complementing each other; (b) in addition to the&#13;
overlapping of the three modes, there also are many overlaps between lines belonging to&#13;
the same system. As a result, while some areas are served very well, other areas&#13;
experience significant service irregularity; (c) while the three public transport modes&#13;
overlap their routes, part of the city, especially north-east is poorly served by any of the&#13;
modes; (d) the low speed (15 to 20 kph) is often caused by poor mechanical condition of&#13;
buses and overcrowding, especially during the peak period; (e) the public transport&#13;
service is very irregular, both because of frequent breakdowns resulting from poor&#13;
maintenance and inefficient route planning; (f) the transfer time between vehicles is long;&#13;
(g) inadequate public information system, whereby, bus routes, bus schedules, and&#13;
location of stops are not displayed clearly. In addition, bus fares vary among different&#13;
services and by time-of-day, and the user is often not clear about trip cost. In addition,&#13;
stops do not satisfy the basic safety requirements for a safe and easy access into the&#13;
vehicles and are often overcrowded resulting in spill over of waiting people onto the main&#13;
roads, which is both a safety hazard for people and reduces vehicle speeds. The primary&#13;

TRAVEL DEMAND FORECASTING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT&#13;
IN ASHGHABAT&#13;
8.    A transport demand model was developed and calibrated for estimating passenger&#13;
transport demand for 1995 which was used to predict travel demand for year 2000. The&#13;
model area included the urbanized area of Ashghabat (including suburban areas), which&#13;
was divided into 25 zones. The road network was represented by links, centroids, and&#13;
zones. The links connect the centroids and zones and used for movement of pedestrians&#13;
and vehicles. Three types of links have been identified: main road, secondary road, and&#13;
service or local roads. The centroids represent the meeting point of different links. The&#13;
zones are trip production and attraction areas, and are connected to the public transport&#13;
network by means of a "dummy" network to be used by pedestrian traffic. The model is&#13;
developed for three public transport systems (bus, trolley bus, and mini bus) and the&#13;
variables specified include: line number, direction, service type, headway, seating&#13;
capacity, and crush capacity. The model is simulated for peak period traffic (6:30 am to&#13;
9:30 am) and divided into four components: trip production and attraction, distribution,&#13;
modal split, and assignment.&#13;
9.    Trip Generation. The basic information is collected for population, jobs, and land&#13;
use patterns for each of the 25 traffic zones. It is assumed that 20 percent of the&#13;
population lives and works in the same traffic zone (based on socio-economic surveys)&#13;
and the trips are mainly by walking which are excluded from the model. Of the balance&#13;
80 percent, about 60 percent use public transport services for commuting. The work trips&#13;
produced by each of the region was assumed to be proportional to the population. Work&#13;
trip attractions at the zonal level were estimated by correlating with the available jobs and&#13;
land use pattems. Total trip productions and attractions (work and nonwork) were&#13;
estimated by assuming that nonwork trips during the morning peak period are 15 percent&#13;
of the work trips.&#13;
10.   Trip Distribution. The model for trip distribution was based on gravity law and&#13;
took the following form:&#13;
(a)   V(ij) = Prod(i) f(K(ij))/ SUM Attrac (j)*f(K(ij))&#13;
(b)   Where: V(ij)= trips between zones i and j&#13;
(i)   Prod (i) = trips produced in zone i&#13;
(ii)   Attr G) = trips attracted by zone j&#13;
(iii)  f(K(ij)) = impedence function&#13;
11.   The impedence function is estimated using "generalized" time of travel, including:&#13;
walk time, wait time, boarding/alighting time, and time-on-vehicle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1                                                                81&#13;
12.   Mode Choice. The model is developed to estimate travel demand volume for&#13;
public transport only, which in the base year (1995) accounted for 60 percent of the total&#13;
traffic volume. The allocation among different public transport modes was estimated&#13;
using a logic choice model based on system performance.&#13;
13.   Trip Assignment. Trip assignment is divided into two phases: (a) creation of&#13;
routes, in which the mode searches for all possible routes and assigns probabilities of&#13;
each of them being used; and (b) traffic assignment based on minimizing generalized&#13;
travel time. The process of trip allocation to the routes used three components: (a) walk&#13;
choice model; (b) transit model; and (c) alternative alighting model.&#13;
14.   The model was calibrated for the base year (1995) using the data from the socio-&#13;
economic survey conducted as part of the proposed project. A comparison of data on&#13;
network assignment with the base year traffic flows indicate large imbalances in the flow&#13;
of different public transport vehicles among different areas. The model was used to&#13;
forecast travel demand for year 2000. The basic assumption was made that population&#13;
growth in Ashghabat continues at 8 percent per annum and mode split between public and&#13;
private transport.modes stays the same till 2000. An alternative scenario was also&#13;
developed using annual 5 percent population growth rate and a lower dependence on&#13;
public transport (40:60). The travel demand projections, additionally, made the following&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
*  diesel buses are expected to continue supporting the increase in passenger&#13;
travel demand in future&#13;
-  trolley bus services will be strengthened on existing lines and one new line is&#13;
proposed to be built by the Government before year 2000;&#13;
*  existing mini-buses will be re-routed to serve as feeder services;&#13;
*  no new mini-buses will be purchased over the next five years.&#13;

ANNEX 2.2&#13;
REPORT OF A SOCIAL ASSESSMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
1.    A social assessment (SA) was conducted in February 1995 as part of the identification&#13;
process for a proposed urban transport project for the city of Ashghabat, Turkmenistan. It&#13;
focused on aspects of demand for and supply of public and private transportation, concentrating&#13;
on various stakeholder groups: households, transport users, bus drivers, drivers of private&#13;
vehicles and enterprises. It also incorporated results of discussions with the public transport&#13;
agency and the municipality.&#13;
2.    Currently, Ashghabat's publicly managed transport system suffers from low vehicle&#13;
utilization, short operating life spans, weak institutional arrangement and management, poor cost&#13;
recovery, and an inadequate road network infrastructure. The purpose of the World Bank project&#13;
is to improve urban transportation in Ashghabat so that it operates efficiently, effectively and&#13;
sustainably.&#13;
3.    The SA aimed to provide a better understanding of the uses people make of urban&#13;
transport, their choices, behavior and needs. It also focused on the behavior of some transport&#13;
suppliers in an attempt to identify incentives to improve their performance. The specific&#13;
objectives of the social assessment are to:&#13;
evaluate the social impact of the proposed World Bank project components on&#13;
households and investigate how certain social groups may be affected;&#13;
*   help identify the most critical interventions to be undertaken immediately to&#13;
improve urban transport in Ashghabat; and&#13;
*   ensure that project objectives and incentives for change are appropriate and&#13;
acceptable to all beneficiaries, particularly low income groups.&#13;
4.    The SA is basically a mechanism to allow consideration of the needs and expectations of&#13;
the people potentially affected by a development intervention-urban transportation in the case of&#13;
this project. Its recommendations stand alone and should be reviewed on the basis of economic,&#13;
financial and technical considerations. Not all needs expressed by actual and potential users of&#13;
urban transportation can meet economic and technical considerations. Similarly,, what may&#13;
appear technically and economically feasible or desirable may not meet people's needs and&#13;
expectations. A SA is not a substitute for other types of assessments essential for good project&#13;
design and implementation, but it is a key input to such a process. It is also a good tool to&#13;
facilitate participation of stakeholders in development projects. The SA process should be&#13;
continued during implementation in order to provide guidance on whether the project is&#13;
achieving its objectives or what modifications should be considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84                                                                         Annex 2.2&#13;
5.    The assessment presented here aimed at a systematic, rapid and cost-effective output,&#13;
and thus combined several methodologies within the short phase of project preparation.&#13;
Performed jointly by a team of social scientists from the World Bank and local experts, it&#13;
comprised the following elements:&#13;
*   A household survey, administered to about 600 households randomly selected from&#13;
the city's 16 districts ("micro-rayons") and focusing on demographic, socio-&#13;
economic, employment, income and travel patterns. A special survey was also&#13;
administered to those households that owned a private vehicle in order to establish&#13;
patterns of private vehicle utilization.&#13;
*   A user survey, conducted with about 1,100 respondents at bus stops throughout the&#13;
city at various times of the day over four days (including one week-end day). This&#13;
survey focused on journey details, such as purpose of trip, waiting time, length of&#13;
trip, and costs.&#13;
*   A survey of vehicle counts and demand composition in over 300 sites, focusing&#13;
on passenger congestion, demand composition and vehicle availability.&#13;
*   An enterprise survey of 92 enterprises, to elucidate the status and importance of&#13;
enterprise transport, and felt needs of the larger enterprises for changes in urban&#13;
transport services.&#13;
6.    In addition, the research team conducted informal interviews with household members,&#13;
transport users, enterprise representatives, and transport suppliers. Several months after the&#13;
analyses of the household, user and enterprise surveys, focus group discussions were held with&#13;
bus drivers, and with users and non-users of monthly bus passes following the tariff raises in&#13;
order to understand why the monthly passes were little used.&#13;
7.    A stakeholder workshop was held to share preliminary survey results with the&#13;
academic community, the representatives of the Ministry of Transport and the municipality. By&#13;
then it was clear that the findings of the SA had been taken on board locally; a number of&#13;
significant reforms in public transport management had been implemented within a month of the&#13;
SA. Service had improved, cost recovery instituted, tariffs raised and the liquidity situation&#13;
improved; and yet at the same time, by control of abuse, the actual cost of transport to the poor&#13;
had been approximately halved. The SA has thus provided inputs to project preparation based on&#13;
what the majority of the city's population actually saw as priorities, created a foundation for the&#13;
future involvement of citizens in making inputs to transport policy and development, contributed&#13;
to the policy dialogue, laid the basis for internal reforms that could be instituted without major&#13;
cost or the need for approval at national government level, and contributed to the overall process&#13;
of reform and democratization by linking decision makers to public opinion on a matter of&#13;
general concern. Because of these changes, the specific findings of the SA on dissatisfaction and&#13;
prices, and on informal driver practices, represent findings as of February 1995, a situation that&#13;
has already begun to improve. Other findings showed more deep-rooted structural and economic&#13;
patterns that are more enduring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2                                                                           85&#13;
Overview of Major Conclusions&#13;
8.     People in Ashghabat rely heavily on public transport. Every day, around 160,000&#13;
citizens, close to one third of the population, use public vehicles for various activities. Buses and&#13;
trolleys are in especially high demand, with 50 percent of the city's work force and 84 percent of&#13;
all transport users rely on these two modes. The cost of public transport bears particularly&#13;
heavily on the poor (Figure 1).&#13;
9.     Generally, bus and trolley users belong to lower income groups, especially the many&#13;
female riders, who are more likely to use buses and trolleys than minibuses, taxis or enterprise&#13;
transport.&#13;
10.   Dissatisfaction with the public transport system is in measure with reliance on it.&#13;
This dissatisfaction has its roots in four main problems: (a) insufficient vehicle&#13;
frequency; (b) high "unofficial fares", and the general unpredictability of fares, resulting&#13;
in uncertainty about trip and joumey costs; (c) insufficient service to peripheral districts,&#13;
and (d) inadequate support infrastructure, including street lighting and sheltered bus&#13;
stops, and road network infrastructure.&#13;
* Vehicle Frequency. Intervals between vehicles, especially buses and trolleys, are&#13;
shortest in the morning, and become longer towards the end of the day, without a&#13;
noticeable improvement during evening rush hours. On week-ends, transport&#13;
services slow down even more, while demand decreases only slightly. The quality&#13;
of service is poor.&#13;
* Costs to Passengers and Willingness To Pay for Improvements. Eighty percent&#13;
of cash-paying passengers paid at least two manats or more-four times the current&#13;
official fare-for a bus or trolley trip. This results partly from a shortage in coinage,&#13;
but mainly from price gouging and "special fare" policies arbitrarily applied by&#13;
drivers. Although the purchase of monthly passes is a theoretical alternative to cash&#13;
payments, many transport users were reluctant to undertake such an investment&#13;
(currently 30 manats), because the unreliability of bus and trolley schedules might&#13;
in any case force them to resort to minibuses or taxis, thus depriving them of an&#13;
acceptable return to their investment. Bus and trolley passengers also had to deal&#13;
with ever-changing fares that could vary according to the time of day or the&#13;
itinerary chosen by the driver for a given trip. Not surprisingly, two thirds of the&#13;
interviewed users were not willing to pay more for an improved system than they&#13;
were paying at the time. The vast majority of users, 94 percent, found an official&#13;
bus or trolley fare of I manat acceptable. This was 20 times the official tariff at&#13;
survey time, and twice the tariff after the April 1995 increase.&#13;
*   Service to the Urban Periphery. Although public transport users suffer from the&#13;
shortcomings of the existing system throughout the city, six outlying districts seem&#13;
to be much worse off than central areas, and seem to require priority attention.&#13;
*   Road Infrastructure. Unsatisfactory road conditions and road infrastructure are&#13;
strong deterrents to many private car owners against the use of their vehicles as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86                                                                         Annex 2.2&#13;
informal taxis, which could provide an important supplement to public&#13;
transportation. Over 70 percent of households are unhappy with their local road&#13;
infrastructure. Especially in northwestern and southern peripheral districts, bad&#13;
road conditions seem to be a major concern.&#13;
11.   Private Taxis. The official taxi service is complemented by a fleet of approximately&#13;
1,350 private taxis--private cars whose owners use their vehicle to offer "informal" taxi services&#13;
to the public. This transport resource has the potential to grow rapidly, once tools and parts for&#13;
vehicle maintenance become more widely available, and road conditions improve. Informal&#13;
taxis play an important role at times when public transport is infrequent, especially over the&#13;
week-end. They could also become serious competitors to official taxis, especially once the taxi&#13;
business becomes privatized and government subsidies are stopped, as suggest in the proposed&#13;
project. Currently no mechanism exists to control informal taxis with regard to road safety and&#13;
environmentally sound operation.&#13;
12.   The Labor Market and the Role of Enterprise Transport.  Many institutions,&#13;
organizations and enterprises provide transport services for their workers and employees. Yet,&#13;
because transport is so unsatisfactory, many Ashghabat workers and employees decide to look&#13;
for employment near their home, as evidenced by the great number of walkers (20 percent of all&#13;
workers). If they have to move home, they are likely to look for another job in their new&#13;
neighborhood. Many enterprise managers report that labor allocation is inefficient (transport&#13;
concerns outweigh comparative skill advantages), and firms experience high rates of moving-&#13;
related job turn-over. However, provision of such transport is seen as an unfortunate necessity.&#13;
Enterprises report that they suffer the burden of having to operate and maintain an expensive&#13;
transport vehicle fleet, to complement inadequate public transport services.&#13;
13.   Improvements in public transportation (whether publicly or privately managed) and&#13;
particularly improvements in bus and trolley services, would directly help lower income groups,&#13;
especially women.&#13;
Description and Analysis of SA Results&#13;
14.   People in Ashghabat use public transportation (bus, trolley, minibus, and publicly&#13;
managed taxis) mainly to go to work, to visit friends, to go shopping, and for other activities,&#13;
such as school and leisure. Over 60 percent of the work force and 54 percent of shoppers depend&#13;
on public transportation. The remainder mostly walk or use private transport. During the past&#13;
five or six years, public transport has become so unreliable, and commuting to work such a&#13;
major problem, that many people have found ways to reduce their dependence on it. They&#13;
change jobs, so that their workplace is closer to home. They abandon shift-working, because&#13;
they cannot get to. and from work at the required times. They make informal arrangements,&#13;
including the use of unofficial taxis. Most working persons have to use a combination of&#13;
different vehicles to reach their work place. The most widely used are buses (which 44 percent&#13;
of working persons use for all or part of their commute), minibuses (29 percent, exclusively or in&#13;
combination with other modes), and trolleybuses (which 24 percent include in their commute).&#13;
At bus stops, 84 percent were waiting for buses or trolleys, and around 10 percent for minibuses.&#13;
The data confirmed the wide use and importance of urban transportation services currently&#13;
provided by the public sector, especially large buses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2                                                                       87&#13;
15.   Lower income groups spend about the same absolute amount on transport as wealthier&#13;
residents. Therefore lower income groups spend about twice the proportion of their income on&#13;
public transport, in comparison with the wealthier (12 percent as compared to 6 percent) (Figure&#13;
1). At the same time, lower income travelers ride the relatively cheaper buses and trolleys, and&#13;
use monthly passes more often than higher income groups. The unreliability of bus and trolley&#13;
services, on the one hand, and difficulties experienced in having relatively inexpensive monthly&#13;
passes forces the lower income groups to use more expensive modes of transport, such as&#13;
minibuses.  Enhanced reliability of services and cost effective improvements in urban&#13;
transportation will thus have a positive impact on low income populations.  Bus stop&#13;
infrastructure improvements were also considered important.&#13;
16.   Comparison of the commuting behavior of male and female working persons showed&#13;
that women are more likely to walk to work: 28 percent of women but only 13 percent of men&#13;
commute on foot. Women do not use private cars or enterprise bus to go to work as often as men&#13;
do. Many factors contribute to this: a greater tendency for women to accept jobs nearer their&#13;
homes, lower wages for female workers, and traditions that favor men's access to private&#13;
vehicles.&#13;

17. A similar comparison by ethnicity reveals that Turkman employees are more likely to walk or take&#13;
a bus, while Russians more often use enterprise transport. This difference is caused by the geographical&#13;
distribution of ethnic groups, their distribution by sector and type of employment, and the recent&#13;
immigration of Turkman groups to the city to work in the informal sector or new enterprises. However&#13;
income, and locational factors such as the distance between home and work, are better predictors of&#13;
transport use than are gender or ethnicity.&#13;
18. A passenger's journey from home to destination, including walking to the bus stop and waiting&#13;
there, lasts 37 minutes on average. Unreliable services, however, cause large deviations from this&#13;
relatively acceptable figure, making many actual and potential transport users dissatisfied.  Bus&#13;
frequency, and consequently waiting times and vehicle congestion, varies by day and by time of the day.&#13;
Vehicle counts at many bus stops show that public vehicle fiequency is acceptable at the beginning of the&#13;
day, that it slackens as the day goes on, and can hardly satisfy demand during the evening peak hours. It&#13;
almost stops entirely over the week-end and in the evenings. Private carriers, whose weekday role is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2                                                                           89&#13;
unimportant, help to bridge the transportation gap at week-ends. Private vehicles, and informally&#13;
operated vehicles, also play a key role in transportation of goods.&#13;
19.  Travel costs were found to be unpredictable and far in excess of official tariffs. Eighty percent of&#13;
cash paying passengers paid a trip cost of 2 manats, 40 times the official bus fare at the time of the&#13;
survey. The main reason for this situation was the shortage of coinage, and the arbitrary "price gouging"&#13;
applied by drivers at certain times of the day, and when making "unofficial" itineraries. Even after the&#13;
official bus tariff was raised by a factor of ten, people were still paying two to four times that amount.&#13;
20.  A district comparison with regard to transport needs and satisfaction shows that the peripheral&#13;
districts especially suffer from inadequate and unreliable public transportation. There are six districts in&#13;
particular that show a combination of features-high commuting levels, high levels of dissatisfaction,&#13;
and high dependency on public transport-in sufficient severity to make them priorities. Of these, three&#13;
are lower income in relation to the city average, one is average and two somewhat above. Together, they&#13;
account for over 50 percent of the city's population. There are indications that infornal private sector&#13;
arrangements are developing to offer some level of remedy to the problems of these neighborhoods.&#13;
Therefore whether or not a public sector response is appropriate ought to be investigated on the basis of&#13;
technical and cost considerations.                  Figure 2: Dissatisfaction with Public&#13;
21.  Close to 90 percent of the respondents in the  Transport in Ashgabat, by District&#13;
household  and   user  surveys  expressed  their&#13;
dissatisfaction with the current system. Ninety percent&#13;
of interviewed users and 85 percent of surveyed&#13;
households claimed that they were unhappy with public&#13;
transportation services-a level of dissatisfaction that&#13;
was spread almost uniformly across the city's 16 sub-&#13;
districts (micro-rayons) (Figure 2).                      90&#13;
22.  A  review  of improvements  suggested  by   CO&#13;
residents showed a strong preference for management    f   70&#13;
.2&#13;
improvements and institutional reform.  Because the  az&#13;
private sector concept is relatively new to the system at   c &#13;
large, suggested  improvements focus on  people's         50&#13;
expectations with respect to the services supplied by the   X   40       1-&#13;
public sector.  However, the shift towards infornal              i&#13;
arrangements (including those supplied by the publicly    ,&#13;
owned vehicle stock), taken together with the use    g   20      ..&#13;
people actually make of these services, suggests that      10    1&#13;
there should also be a focus that will encourage the    a&#13;
informal system and allow competition to develop.          o   9                     6     1&#13;
Whether publicly or privately provided, the explicit                  Dlstrict Nuamber&#13;
proposals of the city's residents identify more&#13;
frequently available transport, especially buses that&#13;
would follow a pre-determined, official schedule and                      Source:_Household_Survey&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90                                                                            Annex 2.2&#13;
itinerary, and charge fixed official fares. Additional routes are important especially to the&#13;
residents of outlying districts and commuters to them, particularly those areas that are&#13;
characterized by low incomes.&#13;
23.    With regard to willingness to pay for improved transport arrangements, 94 percent of&#13;
transport users said they would pay at least twice the current official bus fare (0.5 manats), 66&#13;
percent would pay four times this amount, and about one third were willing to pay six times the&#13;
official fare.&#13;
24.    These figures are sensitive to the amounts people were actually spending on fares: for&#13;
the majority, who paid an actual fare of 2 manats, 34 percent were willing to pay even more, 32&#13;
percent were paying as much as they were willing to, and 34 percent felt they were paying too&#13;
much. This does not mean that official fares are too high. It merely shows that even after the&#13;
official tariff had increased by a factor of ten in April 1995, "unofficial" fares as actually paid to&#13;
the drivers were still double that amount, and that the unofficial fares had reached or exceeded&#13;
many residents' thresholds of willingness (and probably ability) to pay for urban transport.&#13;
When people were asked to name the improvements they expected, and the price they would be&#13;
willing to pay for improved transport services, results indicated a relatively broad room for&#13;
enhanced cost recovery, particularly in areas of vehicle frequency, reliability, congestion and&#13;
seating, and additional routes (Figure 3).&#13;
25.    Enterprise transport.  Over 88 percent of enterprises surveyed claimed to own&#13;
transport vehicles owing to the specific nature of their work, rather than to fill gaps in&#13;
insufficient public transportation services. Almost a quarter of the work-force employed by the&#13;
surveyed enterprises uses enterprise buses to go to work. However, because of high operating&#13;
and maintenance costs for their vehicle fleet, 40 percent of enterprises that currently own&#13;
transport vehicles would prefer not to offer this service, but are reluctant to stop, because they&#13;
believe the public transport system could not carry the additional burden. Many small and newly&#13;
established enterprises use private arrangements or enter into lease arrangements with the public&#13;
transport authority. Poor urban transportation also adversely affects productivity, as reported by&#13;
over 48 percent of the firms and institutions surveyed. Therefore, most enterprises have great&#13;
interest in improved urban transportation and in the formalization of the informal system.&#13;
26.    An increasing fleet of private cars serve as informal taxis throughout the city. The&#13;
number of private cars is uncertain. Official figures show an eight percent increase from 1993 to&#13;
1994 to approximately 6,500, possibly an underestimate of several hundred. However, 27&#13;
percent of households surveyed claimed to "own" a car, probably because they included&#13;
enterprise cars allocated for private use, which would suggest about 30,000 privately-used&#13;
vehicles. Almost 5 percent of households claim to use their car regularly as a taxi. A further 13&#13;
percent of households are seriously considering joining the informal transport market, which&#13;
would bring the worker: informal taxi ratio to 30: 1. Although potential earnings from informal&#13;
taxis are high, many households are reluctant to use their car in this way, mainly owing to the&#13;
perceived high price of fuel, lack of available spare parts, and poor road condition. Whether or&#13;
not they own a car, many households are concerned about poor roads: seventy-two percent of&#13;
respondents considered road infrastructure in their neighborhood to be unsatisfactory, a result&#13;
that was most marked in the city center, and in northwestern and southern peripheries.&#13;

Policy Dialogue and Management Reform&#13;
27.   The SA findings led Ashghabat's public transport management to begin a process of&#13;
Internal reform. They identified changes that could be made to policies and procedures under&#13;
their control, in contrast to policies and procedures requiring national government action or&#13;
external financing. Internal reforms were begun within a month of the SA, before the formal&#13;
report was submitted. By September 1995 an impressive array of changes had been made, and&#13;
the clear impression was received that public levels of dissatisfaction had greatly reduced.&#13;
28.   The SA specifically identified two measures that could be taken. Official bus and trolley&#13;
cash fares could be raised even further to I manat, while the existing minibus fare of 2 manats&#13;
could remain unchanged. As a safety net for the 6.5 percent of users who could not afford these&#13;
tariffs, monthly passes could continue to sell at the current price (30 manats). So as to stabilize&#13;
the fare tariff and prevent revenue leakage, incentives could be created for drivers to stop&#13;
overcharging riders and pocketing the proceeds. Their salaries could be raised, performance&#13;
incentives introduced, while closer supervision and disciplinary measures, including dismissal,&#13;
could be instituted to control poor performance.&#13;
29.   Urban public transport management had become more aware that additional financial&#13;
resources were important, both from external financing and from improved cash generation by&#13;
operations. At the same time, urban transport services could also be improved significantly&#13;
through structural and operational changes. Reforms instituted by management in the wake of&#13;
the SA included the following which were relatively easy and inexpensive to introduce:&#13;
*   Salaries of bus drivers were substantially raised, thus removing the incentive for&#13;
supplementing them by exploiting the public, and increasing job status and&#13;
satisfaction. Transport supervisors were designated to ride on buses so as to control&#13;
the behavior of drivers, and enforce discipline.&#13;
*   The nominal fare of 5 tengge per trip was increased by a factor of ten, to 50 tengge.&#13;
Since the SA revealed that in practice people had been paying twice the new&#13;
amount, the burden on the poor was halved, yet the management began to recover&#13;
costs. Since coins were scarce, books of 20 tickets were sold to the public so that&#13;
passengers paid was the nominal fare irrespective of available coinage. The&#13;
liquidity situation of public transport substantially improved.&#13;
*   Improved liquidity meant more vehicles maintained and in service which, together&#13;
with improved driver performance, allowed improved scheduling. Buses displayed&#13;
routes and fares.&#13;
*   Internal management and personnel were strengthened.&#13;
All of this went a long way to restoring public confidence that officials were making a&#13;
definite effort to improve transport services, and paved the way for future reforms and further&#13;
cost recovery.&#13;
30.   Legalization and Regulation of Private Taxis. Given the important role these vehicles&#13;
play in filling a gap, it appears necessary to regularize the informal taxi business to a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2                                                                        93&#13;
degree (e.g. through annually renewable licenses and flat license fees), but not to the point of a&#13;
severe crowding out of the existing stock. Once the efficiency and capacity of urban transport is&#13;
restored, more elaborate regulation, can be implemented.&#13;
31.   Transport and the Labor Market. The quality and efficiency of urban transport has&#13;
direct economic implications on the city's labor market and enterprise productivity. Since&#13;
people are restricted in choosing the location of their residence due to inflexible public housing&#13;
policies and legal barriers, their job choices are heavily influenced by the quality and efficiency&#13;
of public transport. Overall, improved urban transportation would allow a better, more efficient&#13;
functioning of the labor market (which is especially important during the ongoing period of&#13;
economic transformation and privatization) and help enhance enterprise productivity.&#13;
32.   In the review of the SA (September 1995), the following policy and procedural steps&#13;
were discussed:&#13;
*   Publicizing the results of the SA. This step would acknowledge the widespread&#13;
dissatisfaction which had existed among users of urban public transport at the time&#13;
and demonstrate transport official's willingness to deal with problem areas.&#13;
*   Proposing publicly possible solutions, and discussing the appropriateness of&#13;
their application with stakeholders. These stakeholders include both those&#13;
interested in the solutions--the users--and those involved in implementing them,&#13;
namely management and workers, including drivers and mechanics.&#13;
*   Pointing out that tariff increases, in conjunction with other reforms, would&#13;
reduce the real cost of urban transport. Low fares had not meant cheap&#13;
transport, especially for the poor, and poor cost recovery, in turn, had led to&#13;
inefficiencies and had exacerbated the vicious cycle of problems and denied the&#13;
poor the very transport they needed. In contrast, it had been possible&#13;
simultaneously to increase the tariff substantially while markedly reducing the&#13;
burden on the poor.&#13;
* Improving the quality of service. Consumers needed to be convinced that better&#13;
service would result from tariff increases. Early tariff increases, essential to fund&#13;
transport operations, could come from service improvements that did not require&#13;
major investment, such as further operational, maintenance, and institutional&#13;
reforms. Later tariff increases might have to await more costly capital investment&#13;
such as the rehabilitation and replacement of vehicles.&#13;
* Ensuring a social safety net. Those in special categories who truly cannot afford&#13;
the full tariff--such as students, the very poor, or pensioners-need assured and&#13;
continued access to public transport. Transport companies need a transparent and&#13;
timely way to recover compensation for this subsidy.&#13;
33.   By contributing a stakeholder analysis to the project preparation phase, and by&#13;
researching and presenting the situation, behavior and views of the public and of other&#13;
stakeholders, the SA laid a precedent for continued stakeholder involvement, ensuring that urban&#13;
transport serves the needs of the public. The SA findings are thus very much part of an active&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                                                                      Annex 2.2&#13;
and ongoing policy dialogue with the Government of Turkmenistan. By researching the needs&#13;
and opinions of the public and the users, and by involving decision makers in a process of&#13;
responding to a felt need, the SA has also contributed to the process of including the public in the&#13;
more general process of social and economic reforms.&#13;

ANNEX 4.1&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE - TECHNICAL ADVISORY SERVICES TO APAPO&#13;
1.    APAPO will need external assistance in the implementation of the proposed&#13;
Bank-financed project. To this end, a consulting firm would provide technical advisory&#13;
services to supervise project implementation and ensure that the project achieves its&#13;
stated objectives. It is proposed that the consultants' assignment be implemented in two&#13;
phases. Phase I would be completed over a 9- to 12-month period. A possible second&#13;
phase, at a scale and scope to be agreed upon during negotiations, would be executed over&#13;
an 18 to 24 month period. Phase II would be financed under a proposed Urban Transport&#13;
loan which the Government of Turkmenistan. The consultants are requested to submit a&#13;
proposal for both phases, with staffing and work plan for each phase.&#13;
2.    Phase I will concentrate principally on measures aimed at:&#13;
(a)   advancing procurement of bus and trolleybus vehicles and spare parts,&#13;
(b)   the final preparation of those project components not yet fully developed,&#13;
(c)   implementing key parts of the operations improvement plan Phase II will&#13;
concentrate on:&#13;
(i)   advancing project implementation,&#13;
(ii)  improving the management, operations, maintenance, and finance&#13;
of the passenger transport companies,&#13;
(iii)  national policy formulation in public transport, and&#13;
(iv)  staff training.&#13;
3.    The consultant will conduct most of the assignment in Ashghabat, Turkmenistan&#13;
working with APAPO/PMG staff. However, some work will be required outside&#13;
Ashghabat, especially in the pilot cities of Mary and Chardzhou.  Additional office&#13;
work, to be specified in the consultants proposal, might be conducted at the home office&#13;
or facility of the consultant if the client concurs that this work can be accomplished more&#13;
economically in this manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                                                               Annex 4.1&#13;
4.    The consultant is to report to the Director of the PMG within APAPO for&#13;
administrative purposes and for general direction. While reporting to the PMG Director&#13;
mainly for administrative purposes, the consultant will work in close cooperation with the&#13;
Director of APAPO. In particular, the consultant will work as part of the Operations&#13;
Management Group (OMG) within APAPO and provide ongoing support to each of the&#13;
passenger transport enterprises in Ashghabat.&#13;
5.    Phase I work will proceed under tight deadlines, requiring work on a wide variety&#13;
of tasks, and with a limited amount of funds. For this reason, the consultant will need to&#13;
field staff with broad experience, yet be able to provide specialists for short periods of&#13;
time to assist in specific situations. Since work priorities are likely to shift over the&#13;
period of the assignment, the consultant must be prepared to alter work plans under the&#13;
direction of the PMG director.&#13;
6.    The consultant, while assisting APAPO/PMG, will be expected to promote the&#13;
positive transfer of knowledge and experience to the APAPO/PMG team in their&#13;
everyday work environment. Experience gained during the practical implementation of&#13;
the OIP should be utilized to formulate training recommendations relevant to the future&#13;
development of APAPO and the passenger transport companies participating in the&#13;
project.&#13;
Phase 1: Scope of Work&#13;
7.    To meet the above objectives, the consultant will work with the APAPO/PMG&#13;
staff team to accomplish the Phase I scope of work that is described below.&#13;
8.    The Project Management Group (PMG) will use international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) procedures for procuring 62 buses and 40 trolleybuses in Ashghabat at an&#13;
estimated aggregate value of approximately $20 million. In addition, the consultant will&#13;

* Implementing a procurement training program for selected staff working on&#13;
the project&#13;
B.   Mary and Chardzhou Components&#13;
US $5 million has been allocated under the proposed project for financing&#13;
components in the pilot cities of Mary and Chardzhou. This will include the&#13;
procurement of buses, spare parts, and workshop equipment. The exact scale&#13;
and dimension of the components in each of these cities are not fully known at&#13;
this time, nor are the priorities for operational improvements or institutional&#13;
reforms. Therefore, the consultant will assist APAPO/PMG in the following:&#13;
(a)   (a)   Determining and justifying the composition of the project&#13;
investment program in each of these cities based on a needs analysis,&#13;
(b)   (b)   Preparing an operations improvement plan,&#13;
(c)   (c)   Determining appropriate institutional and contracting arrangements&#13;
for each of these cities, and&#13;
(d)   (d)   Preparing a report for each city summarizing the above findings.&#13;
C.    Vehicle Location and Monitoring System&#13;
The City of Ashghabat wishes to introduce a vehicle location and monitoring&#13;
system to: (a) adjust service intervals in response to a need to take corrective&#13;
action, (b) provide control and monitoring to detect unauthorized deviations from&#13;
routes by drivers, and (c) provide data inputs to service planning systems. The&#13;
consultant, in close coordination with APAPO and the City of Ashghabat, will&#13;
carry out a feasibility study to determine the economic justification for such a&#13;
system, and the optimal size and level of technology. If justified, the consultant&#13;
will prepare specifications for procurement of the required equipment under&#13;
consideration. (See Attachment # 4 for a preliminary description of this proposed&#13;
system.)&#13;
D.   Fare Collection System&#13;
Collection of fares has been a problem in Ashghabat due to an extensive range of&#13;
legal fare exemptions, and further due to a lax collection regime. The consultant&#13;
will propose an improved fare collection system that would be appropriate for&#13;
application in Ashghabat. One proposal has been to introduce an automated&#13;
ticketing system for the entire urban passenger public transport (including the&#13;
existing fleet of buses, trolleybuses, and minibuses). The consultant, however,&#13;
should investigate a range of options, including manual-only systems, as part of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1                                                               105&#13;
feasibility study to determine the most economic ticketing system for Ashghabat.&#13;
The consultant will also determine fare levels that would be required for the&#13;
passenger transport companies to achieve the goal of 100% recovery of operating&#13;
costs with a suitable fare collection system in place. (See Attachment #5 for&#13;
additional guidance on fare collection study tasks that might be undertaken during&#13;
Phase I to underpin the design of an appropriate fare collection system.)&#13;
E.    Contracting Between Ashghabat, APAPO, and the Passenger Transport&#13;
Companies&#13;
An important element of the project will be the development and implementation&#13;
of a contractual agreement between the City of Ashghabat and APAPO for the&#13;
provision of passenger transport services in the City. This agreement will include,&#13;
inter-alia: (a) specified levels of service on specific routes by day and by time, (b)&#13;
prescribed fare levels by type of service, (c) schedules of persons receiving&#13;
exemptions, and (d) a prescribed level of subsidy for the period under contract.&#13;
This contractual relationship will establish the basis for an annual budget&#13;
provision for APAPO services, and for these funds to be advanced to APAPO and&#13;
the passenger transport companies for a specific periods in advance to permit&#13;
them to be able to plan and operate efficiently without a shortage of funds. This&#13;
approach will mean moving away from the subsidy system in which subsidies are&#13;
determined after losses have been incurred, and towards a system in which&#13;
subsidies are determined each year in advance.&#13;
The consultant will assist APAPO in preparing a contract along the above lines&#13;
with the .City of Ashghabat, and similarly will assist in the preparation of&#13;
contracts between APAPO and each of the passenger transport companies (bus,&#13;
trolleybus, and minibus) in Ashghabat. An important element in the development&#13;
of these contracts will be the concomitant development of performance measures&#13;
and monitoring instruments.&#13;
F.   Budgets and Accounting Systems&#13;
The consultant, within the limited cost parameters of the first phase program, will:&#13;
(a)   Identify and propose short term improvements that could be made to the&#13;
existing budgets and accounting systems of the passenger transport&#13;
companies in Ashghabat. These proposals would be further developed and&#13;
implemented during the proposed Phase II program.&#13;
(b)   Establish a simple system for maintaining project accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                                                                 Annex 4.1&#13;
G.   Operations Advice&#13;
The Operations Improvement Plan has identified a number of areas where&#13;
operations could be improved in Ashghabat. The consultant, within the resources&#13;
available under Phase I, will initiate the following tasks that have been identified&#13;
for priority attention by the client:&#13;
(a)   Assist in the development of an optimal route structure taking into&#13;
account the facilities and resources of the three passenger transport&#13;
companies (bus, trolley bus, and minibus) in Ashghabat.&#13;
(b)   Plan and establish procedures and systems for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of dual fuel (diesel/compressed-gas) buses. and provide&#13;
training as necessary.&#13;

provide assistance.&#13;
H.   Maintenance and Rehabilitation Advice&#13;
The Operations Improvement Plan has identified a number of areas where&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation could be improved in Ashghabat. The consultant,&#13;
within the resources available under Phase I, will initiate the following tasks that&#13;
have been identified for priority attention by the client:&#13;
(a)   Develop standards and monitoring systems for improving the stores&#13;
management of the spare parts and workshop tools and equipment,&#13;
including cost standards,&#13;
(b)   Review the inventory of vehicles in the passenger transport fleets&#13;
classified by type, age, and maintenance status,&#13;
(c)   Based on the inventory review, refine the estimates of spare parts required&#13;

(d)   Select vehicles requiring major repair, and list the actual repairs,&#13;
components, and spare parts required to return them to operable condition,&#13;
(e)   Select workshop areas and prepare a list of workshop renovations,&#13;
additional tools and workshop equipment needed to support the&#13;
vehicle rehabilitation program, and&#13;
(f)   Develop a vehicle inspection program  aimed at achieving vehicle&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation on a routine and sustainable basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.1                                                              107&#13;
The consultant would continue work on the above tasks under the proposed Phase II, with&#13;
particular emphasis on their implementation.&#13;
Indicative Phase 11 Scope of Work&#13;

The primary focus of these activities would be to either complete preparation of the tasks&#13;
initiated during Phase I, or to implement these tasks, or both. The paragraphs below&#13;
outline additional tasks that will be added during Phase II.&#13;
11.   Contracts between Mary and Chardzhou and the Passenger Transport Companies.&#13;
Building on the experience gained in Ashghabat, the consultant will assist in the&#13;
preparation of contracts between the Cities of Mary and Chardzhou and the passenger&#13;
transport companies serving these cities.&#13;
12.   Budgets and Accounting Systems. The following activities will be emphasized,&#13;
in addition to the tasks initiated during Phase I:&#13;
(a)   Improvements to the budgeting (capital and operating) and accounting&#13;

substantial portion of his time during the second phase in assisting the passenger transport&#13;
companies in Ashghabat and the two pilot cites in improving the operations,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108                                                                  Annex 4.1&#13;
maintenance, and rehabilitation activities as outlined in the current OIP for Ashghabat&#13;

Staffing for the Assignment&#13;
16.   Phase I Emphasis. Within the available budget for the Phase I assignment,&#13;
consultant time will need to be carefully allocated. While only indicative, the relative&#13;
emphasis the client wishes to place on the assignment during Phase I are approximately&#13;
as follows:&#13;
*  Procurement Assistance                                     40%&#13;
*  Preparation of Mary and Chardzhou Components               10%&#13;
*  Preparation of Vehicle Location and Monitoring System      5%&#13;
*  Preparation of Fare Collection and Automated Ticketing System  5%&#13;
*  Contracting between Ashghabat, APAPO, and the Passenger Transport&#13;

17.   Suggested Staffing. While the decision on staffing is up to the consultant as part&#13;
of his proposal, it is suggested that the consultant team leader might be a bus operations&#13;
expert with strong procurement experience in international competitive bidding. The&#13;
team will also need to field a person (or persons) with a strong finance and administrative&#13;
background, and with experience in contracting between passenger transport companies&#13;
and municipal authorities. The client, while recognizing that use of short term specialists&#13;
on some of the work would be appropriate, would prefer the deployment of at least the&#13;

ANNEX 5.2&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION ASSUMPTION&#13;
1.    The following assumptions are the basis for the projections utilized in the&#13;
financial evaluation in Chapter 5. The assumptions are consistent with those used for the&#13;
economic analysis (Chapter 6).&#13;
2.    Monetary Unit: US dollars.&#13;
3.    Exchange Rate: All investments are expressed in US dollar terms. Historic&#13;
operating costs and other balance sheet items, denominated in US dollars, have been&#13;
converted at the average US$:Manat exchange rates for the relevant period.  All&#13;
projections are on the basis of a nominal exchange rage of US$1 = 5,000 manats.&#13;
4.    Inflation Indices: Cost estimates are based on 1996 prices. Prices of imported&#13;
and importable goods and services, purchased under the project, are escalated at the&#13;
Bank's muv index. The cost of international non-tradeable goods and services are&#13;
escalated at an average annual rate of 25% over the project implementation period. The&#13;
projections are in constant (1996) US dollars.&#13;
5.    Vehicle Operating Inputs. For the base year, the following assumptions were&#13;
used: (a) 55 percent of the total diesel-bus fleet, 70 percent of trolleybus and 60 percent&#13;
of minibuses are available for use; (b) five percent of daily mileage is non-revenue&#13;
earning (dead mileage); (c) on average, vehicles operate for eight hours daily; (d)&#13;
passenger carrying-kilometer is, on average, 80 percent for diesel bus, 95 percent for&#13;
trolleybus and 95 percent for minibus; and (e) average trip lengths are 5.2, 3.3 and 10&#13;
kilometers for bus, trolleybus and minibus, respectively.&#13;
6.    Tariffs. Bus, trolleybus and minibus tariffs are based on the current fare of 50&#13;
manats per ride for each vehicle. No price escalation is applied.&#13;
7.    Operating Costs. The incremental operating costs under the project are fuel, tire&#13;
and maintenance costs. On average, fuel efficiency is 3 kilometers per liter. The life of a&#13;
bus tire is 55,000 kilometers and 50,000 kilometers for trolleybuses and minibuses.&#13;
Annual maintenance costs are assumed to be US$2,000 per bus and per trolleybus and&#13;
US$1,000 per minibus. The project includes US$1.0 million for incremental operating&#13;
expenses, to be funded by the transport enterprises. Labor requirements for the&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of the vehicles are not considered incremental as they will&#13;
be performed "in-house".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
128                                                                  Annex 5.2&#13;
8.    Other Costs. In March 1997, salaries and wages in Turkmenistan have doubled&#13;
for all public enterprises except for selected transport sector companies, including the&#13;
bus, trolleybus and minibus companies. Wages are expected to increase in the near term,&#13;
however, the magnitude and timing of the correction is uncertain. The financial mode&#13;
assumes that wages will increase in average of 50% for each transport companies in the&#13;
base year and remain constant over the project implementation period. Overhead&#13;
expenses are assumed to be about 15% of operating and employee expenses.&#13;
9.    Depreciation. The depreciation schedule was determined based on current&#13;
practice for the class of fixed asset. Depreciation expense was not included in&#13;
discussions of cost recovery targets.&#13;

ANNEX 6.1&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   Basic Methodology Used in the Evaluation&#13;
1.    Underfunding of the investment and operating needs of public transport vehicles&#13;
over the past few years has resulted in reduced operating lives of dieselbuses and&#13;
trolleybuses and accumulation of a substantial backlog of maintenance and vehicle&#13;
replacement requirements. The reduction in public transport capacity is especially&#13;
alarming when viewed in the light of an average annual population growth of eight&#13;
percent in Ashghabat. If efforts are not undertaken to rehabilitate bus fleet, the bus&#13;
garage may effectively have to close down in the next three to four years. Over the past&#13;
few years, the government has augmented the capacity of public vehicle fleet through&#13;
procurement of a large number of new buses without any efforts to rehabilitate existing&#13;
vehicle fleet. The investments by the Government have been sub-optimal as reflected in&#13;
the purchase of sub-standard buses and the new acquisition has not made up for the&#13;
attrition in the capacity of the core bus and trolleybus fleet. The proposed project&#13;
attempts to assess the shortfall in supply relative to demand in the base year and estimates&#13;
additional vehicle requirements in future years to satisfy projected demand.&#13;
2.    The objective of the project is to improve the bus transport  (dieselbus,&#13;
trolleybus, and minibus) service in Ashghabat in terms of:&#13;
(a)   quality of service, by reducing waiting time and crowding while increasing&#13;
service reliability;&#13;
(b)   quantity of service, by satisfying the increasing demand reflecting an&#13;
expected eight percent annual population growth in Ashghabat in the&#13;
medium term plus the pent-up demand in currently under- and unserved&#13;
areas in Ashghabat; and&#13;
(c)   efficiency, by reducing transport unit costs through an integrated and&#13;
balanced program of maintenance, rehabilitation and acquisition of buses&#13;
supported by a broad program to eliminate specific shortcomings and&#13;
weaknesses identified in different operational areas.&#13;
3.   It is against this background that the proposed project includes the following three&#13;
components for which an economic analysis has been undertaken:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
136                                                                 Annex 6.1&#13;
(a)   Component 1. Operations Improvement Plan (OIP). Technical Assistance&#13;
to* strengthen institutional and financial capacity of public transport&#13;
operators and to implement an operations improvement, plan (OIP). The&#13;
OIP includes preparation of optimal routing plans, driving training and&#13;
control, vehicle maintenance practices, services standards, service&#13;
monitoring, and bus and trolleybus terminal management;&#13;
(b)   Component 2. Maintenance and Rehabilitation. Upgrading maintenance&#13;
facilities and equipment, rehabilitation and refurbishment of dieselbus,&#13;
trolleybus, and mini bus facilities. This includes procurement of parts&#13;
needed for major repairs and rehabilitation, spare parts and tires, and tools&#13;
and equipment for garages. The purpose of these investments would be to&#13;
provide the spare parts necessary to put back into operation the vehicle&#13;
fleet currently out of service and augment the capacity of garages to&#13;
provide periodic maintenance; and&#13;
(c)   Component 3. Purchase of New Buses. Purchase of new diesel and&#13;
trolleybuses to improve service delivery, extend transport services to&#13;
currently unserved outlying areas, and set in place new procurement&#13;
procedures as established by Bank guidelines to ensure efficient delivery&#13;
of vehicles in future.&#13;
4.    Methodology. The economic benefits resulting from investments in each of the&#13;
three modes (dieselbus, trolleybus, and minibus) are determined by comparing the "with"&#13;
case with the "without" case. The benefits have been calculated for: (a) investments in all&#13;
three components for each of the modes; and (b) investments in OIP and maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation program (excluding capital cost of new purchases). The "without" project&#13;
case reflects the strategy that in the future unserviceable buses will be promptly replaced&#13;
by Government on an annual basis, a strategy that Government has been following in the&#13;
past few years. A major difference in the "without" case would be that Government&#13;
would continue to make sub-optimal purchases of new vehicle fleet based on its ability to&#13;
barter vehicles for natural gas or petroleum products.  As a result, serviceability of&#13;
vehicles would continue to be low. In addition, in the "without" case, vehicle&#13;
availability would be low becasues of poor operational practices, fragmented institutional&#13;
responsibilities, weak fiscal base, and inadequate maintenance. In the "with" case,&#13;
because of institutional reforms, implementation of OIP, rehabilitation of vehicles, and&#13;
emphasis on cost recovery, it would be possible to improve serviceability ratio and&#13;
operating environment, resulting in availability of a larger vehicle fleet on any day&#13;
operating efficiently, which would result in improved speed, lower waiting time, and&#13;
better access for all residents of the city. The proposed project would rehabilitate a large&#13;
number of existing bus fleet, improving their operating life from existing five to six years&#13;
to about twelve years. The benefits would translate into time savings for the commuting&#13;
public and evolve a mode choice in favor of public transport. The cost to make this&#13;
possible would include: technical assistance; investments in spare parts, workshop, tools&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6.1                                                                 137&#13;
and equipment; incremental operating cost; and investments in purchase of additional&#13;
vehicles.&#13;

1.    Data and Assumptions.  Estimates of passenger demand in Ashghabat by&#13;
different transport modes are obtained from household survey and on-board user surveys,&#13;
conducted as part of the Social Assessment. Estimates of service characteristics, vehicle&#13;
inventory and replacement and maintenance schedule have been obtained from the&#13;
respective operating agencies.    The key assumptions made in the computation of&#13;
economic benefits are:&#13;
*  Operating ratio.  The current operating ratio for dieselbuses is 55%; for&#13;
trolleybuses is 70%; and for mini buses is 70%. The investments under the&#13;
project would improve operating ratio for dieselbuses to 85%; for&#13;
trolleybuses to 90%; and for mini buses to 85%.&#13;
*   Vehicle Rehabilitation. The project will include rehabilitation of 81 buses, 34&#13;
trolleybuses, and 33 minibuses. The Bank loan will finance the spare parts&#13;
for the rehabilitation of 60 Ikarus buses (US$1.5 million, at an average cost of&#13;
US$25,000 per bus) and 34 trolley buses (US$1.02 million, at an average&#13;
cost of US$30,000 per trolleybus). For minibuses, the Bank loan will finance&#13;
spare parts for (a) a program of modification for 101 Iveco minibuses&#13;
(US$.27 million, at an average cost of US$2,700 per bus) to increase their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
138                                                                 Annex 6.1&#13;
operational life to nine years, and (b) rehabilitation of 33 minibuses (US$.33&#13;
million, at an average cost of US$10,000 per bus). The Government will&#13;
finance for the rehabilitation of 21 Laz buses (US$0.32 million, at an average&#13;
cost of US$15,000 per bus) and for labor and utilities costs of US$0.19&#13;
million&#13;
*  Service Life. Average service life for a dieselbus and trolleybus is expected&#13;
to increase to 12 years from the present six years, and for minibus to nine&#13;
years;&#13;
*  Vehicle Price. The project includes purchase of 52 twelve meter diesel buses&#13;
(at an estimated cost of US$120,000 per bus), 10 dual fuel buses (at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$135,000 per bus), and 40 twelve meter trolleybuses (at&#13;
an estimated cost of US$160,000 per trolleybus);&#13;
*  Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC).   VOC per vehicle-km is computed by&#13;
assuming fuel efficiency of 3km/lt without, increasing to 4km/It with the&#13;
project (at a cost of US$.10 per It); tire life of 50,000 km; veh-km/day at 190&#13;
km without and 205 km with the project.&#13;
*  Travel Demand Passenger travel demand for dieselbus in 1996 is 80 million&#13;
trips; for trolleybus 25 million trips; and for mini bus 16 million trips.&#13;
*   Value of Time. Value of time has been calculated at 35 percent of average&#13;
salary of US$700.&#13;
* Travel Demand Growth. Travel demand is expected to grow at 8 percent per&#13;
annum in the medium term.&#13;
e  Service Characteristics. The implementation of OIP is expected to increase&#13;
travel speed from existing 16kph to 20kph, increase frequency from 3.0 to 4.0&#13;
during peak periods. Average trip length is 5.2 km and assumed to remain&#13;
the same in future.&#13;
N NPV Calculations. The NPV is computed at 12% rate of return.&#13;
Project Costs. The project costs include: (a) technical assistance. The technical&#13;
assistance component, at an estimated cost of US$1.8 million (including US$0.3 million&#13;
for the establishment of Project Management Group), will help implement OIP, assist&#13;
PMG with the implementation of the project and the procurement of goods and services,&#13;
assist APAPO with the introduction of improved systems and practices for management&#13;
of all aspects of urban transport operations in the participating cities, and assist municipal&#13;
government and Ministry of Road Transport to further reforms in the urban transport&#13;
sector . The economic analysis for each of the three modes is based on the assumption&#13;
that about 70 percent of the TA is for dieselbuses and 15 percent each for trolleybuses&#13;
and minibuses. (b) Maintenance and Rehabilitation. The base cost of this component&#13;
includes: US$1.6 million for equipment, tools and parts to rehabilitate 81 buses, US$1.1&#13;
million to rehabilitate 34 trolleybuses, and US$0.6 million to rehabilitate 33 minibuses;&#13;
US$2.1 million for spare parts, workshop, computers and other tools and equipment for&#13;
diesel buses, US$1.8 million for trolley buses, and US$1.1 million for minibuses. In&#13;
addition US$2.0 million is estimated for implementing OIP which would include&#13;
improving vehicle monitoring and fare collection system. (c) incremental operating cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.1                                                                 139&#13;
The cost of oprerating additional vehicle fleet with the project is estimated at US$1.0&#13;
million. The calculation of incremental operating cost includes power costs, tire costs,&#13;
and maintainence cost. (d) purchase of new buses. The project includes the purchase of&#13;
52 twelve meter diesel buses and 10 dual fuel buses (US$7.6 million) and 40 twelve&#13;
meter trolleybuses (US$6.4 million).&#13;
5.    Benefits and Returns. The benefits of the proposed investments are computed in&#13;
terms of savings in trip time resulting from higher speed, lower waiting times, improved&#13;
headways, and easier access to public transport because of the availability of a greater&#13;
number of vehicles operating at higher efficiency as compared to without project case.&#13;
Table below shows the economic rate of return for each of the three modes (both with and&#13;
without investments in purchase of new fleet). Tables 1 to 3 provide details on&#13;
computation of economic return. On average, without the project, there would be 135&#13;
dieselbuses, 59 trolleybuses, and 80 minibuses available for service on any particular day;&#13;
in contrast, because of policy reforms and improved operating and service environment,&#13;
the vehicles available with the project would increase to: 208 dieselbuses, 76&#13;
trolleybuses, and 114 minibuses. As a result of availability of a greater number of&#13;
vehicles, it would be possible to improve performance on existing routes as well as&#13;
extend service to currently unserved areas, which are predominantly occupied by lower&#13;
income groups. The rate of return is computed for two cases for each of the three modes:&#13;
(a) the total investments in the public transport system, including purchase of new&#13;
vehicles; and (b) investments for each enterprise, excluding capital cost of new purchases.&#13;
The costs here include the investments required to prepare and implement OIP (including&#13;
technical assistance), build up an inventory of spare parts, and for rehabilitation of&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
6.    The rate of return for the project (including purchase of new vehicle fleet) is&#13;
considerable, although, as expected, the returns increase significantly when the capital&#13;
cost of new vehicles is excluded. The returns from implementation of OIP, technical&#13;
assistance, and rehabilitation of vehicles (extending vehicle life from existing six years to&#13;
twelve year) exceed 50 percent. However, eventually new equipment will have to be&#13;
purchased. The most significant benefit of new vehicles is the inducement it has given&#13;
the Government to undertake key reforms in urban transport, the benefit of which will&#13;
extend far longer than the life of the project.&#13;

7.    Switching Value Analysis. The swithching value for each of the significant&#13;
variables is the value at which the project's NPV becomes zero (or the IRR equals the&#13;
discount rate). Switching values are computed as the percentage change in the value of&#13;
the variable needed to turn the Project's NPV equal to zero and help identify the variables&#13;
which most affect project outcomes. The switching values of the relatively more&#13;
important variables are presented in order of declining sensitivity in table below.&#13;
Table: Presentation of Switching Values&#13;
Variable                                    Switching Value&#13;
Non-availability of spare parts and&#13;
inadequate maintenance beyond project life        -15%&#13;
Delay in implementation of OIP                    -25%&#13;
Cost of new vehicle fleet                          30%&#13;
Per capita income                                 -35%&#13;
Growth in passenger demand                        -70%&#13;
8.    The most critical variable in this project is that institutional and cost recovery&#13;
reforms will not be implemented as promised. If these reforms are not implemented,&#13;
availability rates of new buses would again start declining beyond two years because of&#13;
the lack of spare parts and fleet replacement, and spare parts would once again decline&#13;
because of the aging fleet--a decrease by more than 15 percent in the availability of&#13;
resources for spare parts and maintenance beyond the initial two years will make the NPV&#13;
negative, if other things remain as expected.  The next critical variable is the timely&#13;
implementation of OIP. A delay in implementation of OIP sufficient to reduce vehicle&#13;
availability by more than 25 percent will make the NPV negative. The analysis also&#13;
indicates that the assumed annual eight percent growth in passenger demand is not critical&#13;
to the success of the project--even if annual demand grows by two-and-a-half percent, the&#13;
investments will yield positive return. The per capita income would have to decrease by&#13;
more than 35 percent for the savings in time to be exceeded by the proposed size of&#13;
investments.&#13;
9.    Other Benefits. The project will result in a number of other benefits, difficult to&#13;
quantify. First, improvement in institutional arrangements will enhance efficiency of&#13;
public transport enterprises in providing transport services. Second, the project, through&#13;
improved cost recovery, will reduce subsidies to public transport enterprise, which at&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6.1                                                                          141&#13;
present pose a severe burden on city finances. Third, the project puts in place rational&#13;
procurement policies and procedures for acquisition of new buses and spare parts.&#13;
Fourth, the project supports the creation of an enabling environment for active&#13;
participation by the private sector. Fifth, improved public transport services would&#13;
enhance access to job opportunities for all residents, but especially for low-income&#13;
residents in the outlying districts, and therefore would result in improving living&#13;
conditions for the population. Sixth, improved operational practices, better scheduling&#13;
and routing would encourage a more balanced modal shift.&#13;

            Turkmenistan - Urban Transport Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Urban Transport
            Project is to improve, on a sustainable basis, the
            efficiency and effectiveness of urban transport operations
            in the municipalities of Ashghabat, Mary, and Chardjou.
            Specifically, the investments will: (1) reform management of
            the agencies in charge of urban transport operations in the
            three participating cities; (2) establish a metropolitan
            transport organization (APAPO) responsible for the overall
            management of bus operations; (3) improve cost recovery of
            the operating enterprises; (4) implement an Operations
            Improvement Plan; (5) augment and preserve supply of bus
            services; (6) enhance private sector participation in the
            provision of urban transport services; and (7) establish a
            continuing process of public consultation. The project
            consists of the following components: (1) the purchase of
            diesel buses, electric trolley buses, and a mobile charging
            unit and equipment for diesel buses for the three cities
            mentioned above; (2) rehabilitation of these vehicles to
            include minibuses and spare parts replacement, workshop,
            computers, and other tools and equipment for bus operating
            companies, operating costs coverage, and establishment of
            APAPO; and (3) technical assistance and training for APAPO,
            municipal governments, and staff.
