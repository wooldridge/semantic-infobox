Contingent Liabilities for Infrastructure&#13;
Projects&#13;
Implementing a risk i management frameN-ork for governments&#13;
Chr-istol/pher X   To manage their exposure arising from guarantees to infrastructure projects, governments need&#13;
;I.lvs b Iuc,      to adopt modern risk management techniques. Because guarantees come due only if particular&#13;
events occur and involve no immediate cost to the government, they rarely appear in the&#13;
government accounts or have funds budgeted to cover them. This Note introduces an integrated&#13;
risk management system that draws on recent advances in the private sector. The system,&#13;
adapted for use in the public sector, enables governments to budget for expected losses and to&#13;
set aside reserves against unexpected losses, thus avoiding the budgetary stress associated with&#13;
redirecting scarce public resources to cover a sudden increase in costs.&#13;

            To manage their exposure arising from
            guarantees to infrastructure projects, governments need to
            adopt modern risk management techniques. The authors
            introduce an integrated risk management system that draws on
            recent advances in the private sector. Adapted for use in
            the public sector, the system enables governments to budget
            for expected losses and to set aside reserves against
            unexpected losses, thus avoiding the budgetary stress
            associated with redirecting scarce public resources to cover
            a sudden increase in costs.
