Success Factors for Sustainability&#13;

This field note describes lessons drawn from a review of 25 studies conducted in 15 different countries that&#13;
looked at handpump spare parts supply, particularly in rural areas of African and non-African countries. The&#13;
research suggests a number of key factors that are necessary for successful and sustainable handpump&#13;
spare part supply chains.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(IDE) played a crucial role in developing&#13;
the market for handpumps by&#13;
supporting suppliers (manufacturers and&#13;
installers) with training, seed capital and&#13;
product marketing. IDE's management&#13;
role enabled the supply chain to develop&#13;
successfully and support subsequent&#13;
customer demand for new pumps&#13;
and spare parts, helping to generate&#13;
a thriving market for handpumps. As&#13;
IDE reduced its involvement, those in&#13;
the supply chain were able to provide&#13;
the necessary management function&#13;
themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Ghana (CWSA Ghana 2004, SKAT&#13;
Foundation 2004) a central distribution&#13;
agent with four outlets was provided with&#13;
spare parts and given the responsibility&#13;
to trade through a distribution&#13;
network. Although the project still&#13;
needs considerable donor support,&#13;
it may provide a level of demand that&#13;
secures some measure of long-term&#13;
sustainability. Other projects also in their&#13;
infancy, for example in Mozambique&#13;
(Mozambique Ministry of Public Work&#13;
and Housing 2003) recognize the&#13;
value of supply chain management,&#13;
and advocate the use of private sector&#13;
suppliers to fulfill this role.&#13;
&#13;
How to achieve sustainable&#13;
supply chain management?&#13;
&#13;
The need for a supply chain&#13;
management function seems clear,&#13;
but what is the most sustainable way&#13;
to achieve it? The ideal situation would&#13;
be for a private sector operator to see&#13;
a long-term commercial incentive to&#13;
fulfill this role, provided the operator has&#13;
the necessary business acumen and&#13;
financial capital as well as existing links&#13;
to a network of distributors. To date&#13;

conditions. The WSP investigation into&#13;
low cost irrigation in Bangladesh (WSP&#13;
August 2000) showed that users made&#13;
economic decisions to purchase lower&#13;
quality pumps that only lasted two years,&#13;
instead of pumps 50 percent higher&#13;
in price (on average) that lasted five to&#13;
seven years. This trade-off between&#13;
price and quality, linked to income&#13;
levels, is an important consideration for&#13;
development agencies, as it challenges&#13;
conventional technology development&#13;
practice to increase quality and reliability.&#13;
It has implications for supply chains&#13;
because quality standards have the&#13;
potential to rule out local manufacturing.&#13;

Technology selection is an iterative&#13;
process. The first step is to determine&#13;
the geological and environmental&#13;
requirements. The next step should&#13;
be to select the simplest technology&#13;
possible and to conduct a market&#13;
assessment to determine the viability&#13;
of a private sector supply chain.&#13;
In Mozambique (Government of&#13;
Mozambique May 2003) this process&#13;
started in Inhambane province. To assist&#13;
this process Harvey and Reed (2004)&#13;

When the network was privatized, the&#13;
profits from spare parts were not high&#13;
enough for the new individual shop&#13;
owners, and the supply chain was broken&#13;
(Kandulu 2004) (Harvey and Reed 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Public sector supply chains&#13;
&#13;
Where private and private/public sector&#13;
supply chains are not viable, the public&#13;
sector model is the alternative. These&#13;
supply chains require a long-term&#13;
commitment to support spares provision.&#13;
Typically funds will come from donors&#13;
through Government, and the supply&#13;
chain can be operated by Government&#13;

         private /public partnerships. Longer supply chains require more management and          organizations, with an adequate&#13;

    ·    There is limited evidence of successful stand-alone private sector supply chains        distribute spare parts. In most countries&#13;
         for rural water supply support services in Africa, but there is potential for private/  the ultimate responsibility for service&#13;

    ·    Tools exist to approximate potential demand for the goods and services delivered        Whilst there is no straightforward&#13;
         by supply chains (measuring spares requirements and population densities per            formula, there is the potential for a&#13;
         geographical area), but rural water technology services have greater potential for      logical process to direct those who are&#13;

Box 4. Supply chain development - steps to success&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 1&#13;
Define the geological and environmental constraints of the project area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 2&#13;
Determine the range of technologies available, together with reliability profiles and spares and support&#13;
requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 3&#13;
Facilitate the coordination of countrywide stakeholders (private, Government, NGO, public, donors) to adopt&#13;
a `learning journey' approach to training, in order to understand the dynamics of the private sector in general,&#13;
and the spare parts supply chain in particular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 4&#13;
Conduct a market assessment which includes:&#13;
    · determining potential spares business (see Harvey and Reed calculation Footnote 2)&#13;
    · identifying all constraints to private sector supply chain development including Government&#13;
       procurement policy, access to credit, business development support for traders, ability and willingness&#13;
       to pay, and attitudes of end users&#13;
    · determining comparative markets and supply chains already in existence&#13;
    · determining other projects and donor/NGO approaches to subsidy support of pumps and spares&#13;
    · identifying options for the supply chain management function&#13;
    · identifying options for public sector supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 5&#13;
Decide on appropriate supply chain and technology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 6&#13;
Influence policy change where required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 7&#13;
Plan the supply chain management function, and identify a clear exit strategy for external public sector&#13;
agencies (in particular for donors).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 8&#13;
Plan policy implementation and ensure a continued coordinated approach with other agencies, as part of&#13;
the ongoing `learning journey'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 9&#13;
Implement using project management action planning practice (the plan, do, review, plan cycle).&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This field note describes lessons drawn
            from a review of 25 studies conducted in 15 different
            countries that looked at handpump spare parts supply,
            particularly in rural areas of African and non-African
            countries. The research suggests a number of key factors
            that are necessary for successful and sustainable handpump
            spare part supply chains.
