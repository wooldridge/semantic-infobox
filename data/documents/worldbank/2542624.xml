other factors for that to work-everything from parents' knowledge and behavior, to the ease and safety of&#13;

Making Services Work&#13;
for Poor People                                                                            "'&#13;
Too often, services fail poor people - in access, in quality, and in affordability.&#13;
But the fact that there are striking examples where basic services such as water,&#13;
sanitation, health, education, and electricity do work for poor-people mneans&#13;
that governments and citizens can do a better job of providing them. Learning&#13;
from success and understanding the sources of failure, this year's WMorld&#13;
Development Report - Making Services Workfor Poor People- argues that&#13;
services can be improved by putting poor people at the center af snervice provi-&#13;
sion. How? By enabling the poor to monitor and discipline service pr6vidiers,&#13;
by amplifying their voice in policymaking, and by strengthening the incentives&#13;
for providers to serve the poor.&#13;
Freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy are two of thc miiost impor-&#13;
tant ways poor people can escape from poverty. To achieve these goals, eco-&#13;
nomic growth and financial resources are of course necessary, but they are not&#13;
enough. The World Development Report provides a practical framework for&#13;
making the services that contribute to human development work for poor&#13;
people. With this framework, citizens, governments, arid donors can takge&#13;
action and accelerate progress toward the common objective of poverty reduc-&#13;
tion, as specified in the Millennium Development Goals.&#13;

            services work for poor people - Overview
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Development Report (WDR) 2004
            builds an analytical, and practical framework for using
            resources, whether internal or external, more effectively by
            making services work for poor people. The focus is on those
            services that have the most direct link with human
            development - education, health, water, sanitation, and
            electricity. This presents an enormous challenge, because
            making services work for the poor involves changing, not
            only service delivery arrangements, but also public sector
            institutions, and how foreign aid is transferred. This WDR
            explores the many dimensions of poverty, through outcomes of
            service delivery for poor people, and stipulates affordable
            access to services is low - especially for poor people - in
            addition to a wide range of failures in quality. The public
            responsibility is highlighted, addressing the need for more
            public spending, and technical adjustments, based on
            incentives and understanding what, and why services need to
            be improved. Thus, through an analytical framework, it is
            suggested the complexity of accountability must be
            established, as well as instruments for reforming
            institutions to improve services, illustrated through
            various case studies, both in developing, and developed
            countries. The report further outlines that scaling up
            reforms means sectoral reforms must be linked to ongoing, or
            nascent public sector reforms, in areas such as budget
            management, decentralization, and public administration
            reform, stimulated through information as a catalyst for
            change, and as an input to prod the success of other reforms.
