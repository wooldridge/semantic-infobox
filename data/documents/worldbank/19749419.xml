December 19, 1994&#13;
&#13;
                    INTERVIEWEE'S INTRODUCTION.&#13;
      This is an oral history. I have therefore resisted the&#13;
temptation to re-write the text thoroughly, and restricted my&#13;
revisions to rendering intelligible those passages that appeared&#13;
thoroughly garbled. After-thoughts I have put into the many footnotes&#13;
and occasional end-notes.&#13;
      The temptation to re-write more drastically had been thorough,&#13;
because re-reading with the greater detachment given by the many&#13;
months spent since leaving the World Bank, I realized that I had often&#13;
not been to the point, I also often soke to the question from the&#13;
small end of the telescope, looking at the Bank as a mirror reflecting&#13;
Jean Baneth, rather than vice versa. And, perhaps, I also give the&#13;
impression of trying hard to write Jean Baneth's apologia vita sua.&#13;
But that was my frame of mind upon retirement, and that too should be&#13;
part of the record.&#13;
      Too much about Jean Baneth left me saying too little about all&#13;
others. For us old-timers, the World Bank was much more than a job.&#13;
Particularly for those of us (fewer as time went by) who came to the&#13;
Bank and washington straight from abroad, it became a total&#13;
environment, a way of life. Living in Washington (and in Delhi, and&#13;
Jakarta, and Geneva), we were never quite of Washington, nor of&#13;
America (nor of Delhi, Jakarta nor Geneva}; we were of the World Bank&#13;
in these places. A good thing, then, that so many of the people we&#13;
have known were kind, humane, funny, brilliant; sometimes all of those&#13;
together.&#13;
      A good thing too that the Bank itself has played an essentially&#13;
highly valuable role. I have not been sparing of my criticism; and I&#13;
have much more to say along the same lines. But those should be seen&#13;
as the criticism of a family member, the expressions of irritation&#13;
that a beloved relative should not be wholly perfect, that the&#13;
heritage of the founders should not have been used in wholly&#13;
beneficial way.&#13;
      This interview is about the past - the Bank's past and mine,&#13;
which over more than half of the one and more than three fifths of the&#13;
other, coincide. I will resist the temptation to end this introduction&#13;
with a word about the future.&#13;
      Finally, I wish to present my apologies and congratulations to&#13;
Jochen Kraske. Apologies, because just about every one of his&#13;
questions I appear to have interrupted. Even if I make allowances for&#13;
questions trailing off into interrogative notes that were not then&#13;
transcribed, I still must have interrupted him more frequently than&#13;
not. And my grateful compliments for his patient guidance.&#13;
               ******************************************&#13;
Q:    I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's Historian.&#13;
Q:    I'm David Milobsky, the Assistant to the Historian.&#13;
&#13;
A;    I'm Jean Baneth, the interviewee.&#13;
Q:    Well, welcome, Jean, and thanks for agreeing to participate in&#13;
our own oral history program.     I guess you grew up in France and you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     1&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 2&#13;
  had all of your early education in France.      Can you tell us when and&#13;
&#13;
  how you first developed a plan to become an economist?&#13;
&#13;
  A:    I first decided to become an economist when I found out that I&#13;
&#13;
  wasn't really good enough in math to be a chemist, a chemical&#13;
&#13;
  engineer.    That was in my last year of high school, where you&#13;
&#13;
  specialize in France, and you have nine hours of math a week.      And I&#13;
&#13;
  was doing okay, but I wasn't doing as well as I wanted to, so I&#13;
&#13;
  decided that instead of going into chemistry I was going to Political&#13;
&#13;
  Science, the Institut d'Etudes Politiques, which I did, specializing&#13;
&#13;
  in public finance in my third year, specializing in economics. There&#13;
&#13;
  were four sections in the second year, and I took economics, and in&#13;
&#13;
  the third year within that you take public or private, and I did&#13;
&#13;
 public. This meant that I was not going to French Civil Service 1 which&#13;
&#13;
  was another section, essentially, the Service Public. I was thinking&#13;
&#13;
  about some UN-related, economic development related agencies.&#13;
&#13;
  Somebody reminded me of that quite recently1 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
        Then, in my second year, I heard about the Fulbright Scholarship&#13;
&#13;
  Program.    I applied, I got a fellowship for Yale, and voila.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:    And at Yale you continued with Economics?&#13;
&#13;
  A:    Oh, yes.    I went into Economics.    They had something called the&#13;
&#13;
  International and Foreign Economic Administration Program, which is&#13;
&#13;
  what I got my fellowship for. And my Master's was in the same program.&#13;
&#13;
  And then I went over to the regular Ph.D. program.      I passed the&#13;
&#13;
  exams 1 and then I went back.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:    So you spent two years at Yale?      And then went back to finish&#13;
&#13;
  your education.&#13;
&#13;
  A:    Well, I did.    I went back.   I worked for a year, and then I&#13;
&#13;
  finished my education.    You could say that, because I went into the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     1&#13;
       A girl I used to know fairly well at Sciences Po, whom I&#13;
met after thirty-some years.&#13;
&#13;
                                       2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Baneth, Page 3&#13;
 Army, and did my 28 months (which actually turned out to be a little&#13;
&#13;
 shorter) of military service, and that was quite an education.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     But, your education in France--&#13;
&#13;
 A:     That was finished.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     That was already finished by the time--&#13;
&#13;
 A:     I had a diploma, I had graduated from the Political Science&#13;
&#13;
 School, in a good rank, and I went on to Yale after that.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     Can you say a little bit more. When you started your education&#13;
&#13;
 you said you had in a sense decided you were not going into the public&#13;
&#13;
 service in France, yet you were thinking of the public service at the&#13;
&#13;
 international level.        What was the reason to make that distinction?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     I remember this all the more clearly as, a few years ago, I met&#13;
&#13;
 a girl whom   I used to know fairly well at the University, before&#13;
&#13;
 graduating from Sciences Po, and eventually talking about what we had&#13;
&#13;
 done since then, I mentioned the World Bank;          11&#13;
                                                            Aah, she said,   that's&#13;
&#13;
 always what you had wanted to do".           And that very clearly reminded me.&#13;
&#13;
 I don't know why I decided2 â&#128;¢       I am not even sure that it was quite&#13;
 that simple, because one first had to decide whether to go into the&#13;
&#13;
  "service public   11&#13;
                         else; and I went into economics.        And it was only at&#13;
&#13;
  the end of the second year that I decided that my third year would be&#13;
&#13;
 public finance, and why, I do not know.&#13;
&#13;
        I did very well. I was doing very well in accounting, which was&#13;
&#13;
 one of my favorite subjects, but it wasn't that.               I had started to&#13;
&#13;
 work on something, what you call a memoire, sort of thesis, a mini-&#13;
&#13;
 thesis.   You know that I'm originally from Hungary and in those days I&#13;
&#13;
 was still speaking or reading at least Hungarian, and there was a&#13;
&#13;
  fellow called Marczewski, a fairly well known student of Eastern&#13;
&#13;
 European economics, and I started working on a rnemoire with him, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     2 I had certainly not thought about the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
specifically; but about some form of international work.&#13;
&#13;
                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Baneth, Page 4&#13;
  then he actually invited me to replace - oh, who was it, Bobrowski, a&#13;
&#13;
  Pole who then went back home to become the Head of the Polish Planning&#13;
&#13;
 Agency under Gomulka.           His wife was of Romanian-Hungarian origin and&#13;
&#13;
 she was working with Marczewski, and when she left with him, he&#13;
&#13;
  invited me to join his Center, which was quite flattering; that got me&#13;
&#13;
  interested in more public work.          On the other hand,   I probably would&#13;
&#13;
 not have done this memoire if I had not already been in that position,&#13;
&#13;
 so who knows?&#13;
&#13;
           I   really don't know how exactly it went, but you start with the&#13;
&#13;
  Professors we had.        I   had Fran9ois Bloch-Laine, who was the Head of&#13;
&#13;
 Caisse des       oepOts et Consignations, and a very great man, who was very&#13;
  impressive, and whom I liked; Paul Delouvrier 3 , who was also very well&#13;
&#13;
 known.&#13;
&#13;
           Those were also the days of Mendes-France's passage as Prime&#13;
&#13;
 Minister, and shortly thereafter his book came out, La Science&#13;
&#13;
 Economigue et !'Action, so all these things may have worked to orient&#13;
&#13;
 me away from the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand, perhaps if a commercial bank had come to me&#13;
&#13;
  in those days and said, here's a job that pays a million francs per&#13;
&#13;
 month,        I might have accepted that.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Because you are distinguished, you mentioned that you were in&#13;
&#13;
 more of a public finance track as opposed to a more civil service&#13;
&#13;
  track.&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Yes.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        What, particular course of study, what are some differences&#13;
&#13;
 between those three courses that you said--?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        This was 35 years ago.      The Service Public was very clearly&#13;
&#13;
  aimed at preparing people for a specific goal.          Every French&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      3He was at that time Head of Electricite de France; he&#13;
became Governor of Algeria under Generale Gaulle.&#13;
&#13;
                                             4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Baneth, Page 5&#13;
examination prepares you for another examination.                   And Service Public&#13;
&#13;
track is what you followed if you wanted to go to the Ecole Nationale&#13;
&#13;
d'Administration (ENA).              It   is not formally indispensable to do that,&#13;
&#13;
but a very high proportion of those who enter ENA go through that.&#13;
&#13;
And I did not take that track.&#13;
&#13;
      I wrote something about this more recently.                   You make these&#13;
&#13;
decisions without knowing what you decide.                   You know what you decide&#13;
&#13;
only once you have followed the decision. I did not really know where&#13;
&#13;
it was leading, and it was not clear how hard or easy it was. When&#13;
&#13;
asked in my third year,         11&#13;
                                     what is it that you have in mind? 11   ,   I must&#13;
&#13;
have said    11&#13;
                  Some work on development 11      ,   which indeed was of interest to&#13;
&#13;
me in those days.         But how I made the decision, I cannot really state.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:    If that is any help, I know that I was fascinated by India since&#13;
&#13;
I had been a very small boy and read something about India when I was&#13;
&#13;
about six.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    I didn't know, incidentally, that you were born in Hungary.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Oh, you didn't know?&#13;
&#13;
Q:    I knew that you had some relationship with--&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes.         I was born in Hungary.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    When did you come out of--?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Right after the war.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Uhuh.         Did you know Arthur Karasz?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I know of him but I don't recall meeting him.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Because he also, of course--&#13;
&#13;
A:    I know.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now.         Yes.   I mean--&#13;
&#13;
A:    So did Tibor Mende, whom I did meet.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now,        the next question is really whether in the course of your&#13;
&#13;
studies, both in France and at Yale, you had any particular area of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Baneth, Page 6&#13;
 economics that you focused on.       I see that you published something in&#13;
&#13;
  '59 already on balance of payments.&#13;
&#13;
 A:       Correct. In France, in Sciences Po, you have a huge array of&#13;
 courses and two thirds of them are in fact optional.              But I did take&#13;
&#13;
 something.     In fact,   the only course where I did badly at the exam was&#13;
&#13;
 something on Egypt.       I passed my oral exam with Michel Kaplan, who was&#13;
&#13;
 Secretary General of the Suez Canal Company, and I think he thought I&#13;
&#13;
 was too hard on Nasser. I wonder what he thought a few weeks later,&#13;
 after the nationalization speech. I had also met Tibor Mende, who&#13;
&#13;
 wrote about the Third World, who had invented the term "Third World,"&#13;
&#13;
 I think, and so on.       By the way, he was also of Hungarian origin but&#13;
 that's not why I met him.       I was interested in development, and I must&#13;
&#13;
 have said something about it when I wrote my scholarship application,&#13;
&#13;
 but I don't remember what.       I do know that at Yale I did take the&#13;
&#13;
 development course, Henry Bruton's, I took the Soviet economics&#13;
&#13;
 course, and then the international economics course, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
 And, yes, I became more specialized.         On the other hand, this thing&#13;
&#13;
 that I published, that was because of Robert Triffin'.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       You did, was he the one you did your dissertation with, or--&#13;
&#13;
 A:       I did not do a dissertation.       I never wrote a dissertation.       I&#13;
&#13;
 went back and I defended France in Algeria,            in fact,   so I never did a&#13;
&#13;
 dissertation.     No.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       But you took courses with--&#13;
&#13;
 A:       I took a course with him.     Then he asked me to translate his&#13;
&#13;
  "Convertibility~   or the Morning After,     11&#13;
                                                    in '58.   And then I was asked,&#13;
&#13;
 or he was asked, maybe, and asked me, to write some follow-up on it&#13;
&#13;
 directly in French, which I did.        And this was about convertibility&#13;
&#13;
 and about the U.S. balance of payments and liquidity issues--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      4&#13;
      Who was not a development specialist, but a specialist of&#13;
international payments and monetary issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                         6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Baneth, Page 7&#13;
Q:       Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:       That's right. I also wrote something in Le Mende Diplomatique,&#13;
&#13;
which was a letter I wrote from my military service desk and they&#13;
&#13;
published it, then paid me the princely sum of 76 francs, which was&#13;
&#13;
about two-months' salary in those days for me.&#13;
                                                                                  ,&#13;
Q:       Your military career was--&#13;
&#13;
A:       Brilliant.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Was it?&#13;
&#13;
A:       Brilliant. I started very low as private second class, but I&#13;
&#13;
worked my way up all the way to private first class by the end5 , so--&#13;
&#13;
Q:       But you were not enticed to remain in military service?&#13;
&#13;
A:       To remain as a volunteer?     I remained as long as I had to. Even&#13;
&#13;
the professional soldiers, who had          enlisted, by the time they were&#13;
&#13;
finished were shouting "only another 22 months 1eft 11      â&#128;¢   No, I certainly&#13;
&#13;
was not even getting used to it.        In fact,   for many years thereafter I&#13;
&#13;
had nightmares, dreaming that they did not want to let me go. I had&#13;
&#13;
managed to get a place in a military plane out of Blida and the&#13;
&#13;
General did not want to give us an escort, so we actually falsified&#13;
&#13;
the order of mission to get all the way to Blida, and I had nightmares&#13;
&#13;
for 10, 15, 20 years after that they did not want to let me go.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Okay.     Now, and more or less, right after you came out of&#13;
&#13;
military service you went to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:       I directly came to the Bank.       I--&#13;
&#13;
Q:       How did that come about?     And why the Bank and not, say, the&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Fund?&#13;
&#13;
A:       The Bank had asked me and the Fund had not, it was that simple.&#13;
&#13;
I was in France, as I said,       I went back in '59, I got a job in the&#13;
&#13;
SEDES, a small firm with private sector status, wholly owned by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     5&#13;
         N. B. This is a joke.&#13;
                                        7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            Baneth, Page 8&#13;
Caisse des depOts et Constignations, then managed by Fran9osis Bloch-&#13;
&#13;
Lain8.           I had gone back to France before I had to, under the military&#13;
&#13;
service rules, because I wanted to get married, which I did.                           And I&#13;
&#13;
was working when I got a letter from the Service de Prospection des&#13;
&#13;
Experts pour la Cooperation Economique Internationals, which was in&#13;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, actually several letters, saying that&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank was interested in recruiting me.                        I had a job--&#13;
&#13;
Q:              Specifically by name they were asking for you?&#13;
&#13;
A:              Well,   I got this letter, I had a job, and I had not particularly&#13;
&#13;
thought of the World Bank.                Anyway, I went to see this man, and he&#13;
&#13;
showed me the Bank's letter and, yes, it had two or three names,&#13;
&#13;
including mine.             I was working and I had my military service to do,&#13;
&#13;
and in France you can get deferred for a time but in the end you have&#13;
&#13;
to go, and that was my response.                I don't remember if I had to fill&#13;
&#13;
out a paper or not, but later I was interviewed by Jeffrey Ruczinski&#13;
&#13;
and, oh, God, what's the man 's name? Rist. They interviewed me and&#13;
&#13;
they asked me what I was working on and I told them I was working on&#13;
11   shadow pricesn, so Rist, who was then the Bank's Chief Economist,&#13;
&#13;
said       11&#13;
                what is that? 11   I was not sure whether this was a subtle way of&#13;
&#13;
his to interrogate me, or whether he actually did not know.                        Anyway, I&#13;
&#13;
told them that I would not want to join now, I had to do this little&#13;
&#13;
formality of 28 months with the military. And then they pursued it.                            I&#13;
&#13;
had not actually decided necessarily to join.                        As I said, I had a job.&#13;
&#13;
But the Bank kept after me. Don Fowler' later said that he had widely&#13;
&#13;
circulated the letter I had written very early in my military service.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank had asked questions like               11&#13;
                                                     What are you doing?      Is this&#13;
&#13;
relevant to development? 11           â&#128;¢   And I wrote back,     11&#13;
                                                                     i t is very relevant.     I&#13;
&#13;
am learning how to eat without edible food, how to keep clean without&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       6&#13;
            Then Head of the Personnel Division.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 9&#13;
  water, etc.".&#13;
&#13;
          Then they wrote again.     At some point I was in Algeria, and I&#13;
&#13;
 wrote back and said I was interested. I think during my leave from&#13;
&#13;
 Algeria I had gone to see my old boss, and I discussed what was&#13;
&#13;
  awaiting me, and decided that I would take the Bank's offer. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
 made the offer and it came, your usual Bank thing, 900 pages of&#13;
&#13;
  telegrams that had come to Beni Messous, and I said Yes.           And then I&#13;
&#13;
 came back to France and put on some weight, because I was fairly thin&#13;
&#13;
 and so on, and waved au revoir to France, and came.&#13;
&#13;
          I returned to France nearly at the end of October, it must have&#13;
&#13;
 been on the 28th. Algeria was independent.          We must have left for&#13;
&#13;
 America around the 15th of December, or 13th of December, something&#13;
&#13;
 like that.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       And joining the Bank meant joining the East and--&#13;
&#13;
 A:       South Asia and Middle East Department, yes.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       --department.     But you were assigned to--&#13;
&#13;
 A:       Middle East.     It was Bill Brakel's Division. It was mixed.&#13;
&#13;
 Syria, Jordan, Lebanon--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       Iran?&#13;
&#13;
 A:       Iran.     Yes, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:       And I suppose you did work principally on Iran and--?&#13;
&#13;
 A:       No.     Actually, in those days in the Bank, for the first six&#13;
&#13;
 months you wondered what the hell you were doing here.          Actually it&#13;
&#13;
 was less than that,       I went on my first mission to Syria 7 ,   came back,&#13;
&#13;
 had another mission to Kuwait 8     â&#128;¢   It was the tail end of the so-called&#13;
&#13;
  survey mission which had been interrupted by the threat of invasion&#13;
&#13;
  from Iraq. Things then changed dramatically.         They got frightened and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      7&#13;
          In March 1963.&#13;
      8&#13;
      Soon after the 1963 Annual Meeting, probably in&#13;
November.&#13;
&#13;
                                           9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Baneth, Page 10&#13;
they didn't want anything to be published, and when the threat&#13;
&#13;
receded, because Kassem had been torn limb by limb by irate Iraqis,&#13;
&#13;
the Kuwaitis said, okay, finish the report.       So I went back with&#13;
&#13;
McDiarmid and another man whose name I don't really remember.          I guess&#13;
&#13;
we finished working on Syria with negotiations before Christmas 1963,&#13;
&#13;
on Christmas Eve '63 we actually signed the first credit.       I also&#13;
&#13;
spent quite a lot of time commenting on reports for Loan Committee or&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee meetings for my superiors.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        Until--&#13;
&#13;
A:        Sometime early '64, well before September.   I had commented on&#13;
&#13;
some papers about India.      And I remember my comments started out with&#13;
&#13;
something saying this model is a tautological model; somebody else of&#13;
&#13;
course passed some of my comments on to Drag Avrarnowicz who had been&#13;
&#13;
responsible for      supervising the report, and his comments ended up&#13;
&#13;
with:     " I don't know why economic debate has to be so acrimonious".&#13;
&#13;
          I might have been slightly acerbic.   It's unlike me to be&#13;
&#13;
acerbic, but it might have been the case.       This is what provoked my&#13;
&#13;
assignment to India, when they were talking about the Bell mission.&#13;
&#13;
They told me sometime late spring or early summer - it must have been&#13;
&#13;
summer because Gi-Gi 9 had gone on home leave, but I had not yet gone.&#13;
&#13;
Willem Brakel 10 was going on home leave and he was called in by Sandy&#13;
&#13;
Stevenson '' and he came back badly shaken, saying he was told that he&#13;
&#13;
was transferred to Deputy Director of EDI, so he was leaving the&#13;
&#13;
Division, and that they will want to send me to India and they'll talk&#13;
&#13;
to me about it later.      Then I talked to them and I talked to Bernie&#13;
&#13;
Bell, but this was arranged in the early summer, it was before I went&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     9&#13;
          My wife.&#13;
     10&#13;
          My Division Chief.&#13;
     11   Then Deputy Director of the South Asia Department.&#13;
&#13;
                                      10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Baneth, Page 11&#13;
on home leave and then from home leave I directly proceeded to India.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Before you got to--&#13;
&#13;
A:    I was the first mission member recruited basically.     Then we had&#13;
&#13;
a long argument as to whether I could take my wife, which after about&#13;
&#13;
six weeks they agreed, and much later, to my great amusement we all&#13;
&#13;
learned, that David Holland and Stanley Please had to go through&#13;
&#13;
exactly the same argument four months later.    And nobody told them&#13;
&#13;
that in my case it had already been settled.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    So, in those pre-India days, when you were doing those first&#13;
&#13;
missions to Syria and Kuwait, what kinds of projects were these&#13;
&#13;
credits financing?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Well,   in Kuwait there was no project, no lending, no nothing.&#13;
&#13;
It was a survey Mission, the Kuwaitis paid for it fully,    it was just&#13;
&#13;
to advise them.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Okay.&#13;
&#13;
A:    The so-called "Survey Missions" then became "Basic Missions .. and&#13;
that is what they are called now.&#13;
&#13;
      In Syria, there was a road, a highway project had been&#13;
&#13;
contemplated for a hell of a long time.    There had been various&#13;
&#13;
political developments which made it inexpeditious, and then finally&#13;
&#13;
we went in the middle of a coup, and we did a two-man economic mission&#13;
&#13;
and we looked at what the investment program was, how they were&#13;
&#13;
overextended, how were they doing incentives and so on.     During our&#13;
&#13;
first economic mission, in retrospect, clearly there are lots of other&#13;
&#13;
questions I should have wanted to ask, but on the other hand, I know&#13;
&#13;
that the highway mission surveyed 300 miles of broken-down highway,&#13;
&#13;
and they never slept out of Damascus. Towards the end, they were going&#13;
&#13;
to fly over the highway in a commercial aircraft but the aircraft&#13;
&#13;
could not take off in time, so in the end the did not even do that.       I&#13;
&#13;
know all that.    So the economic mission was pretty serious compared to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Baneth, Page 12&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
          In Kuwait, we were three but the original survey mission was&#13;
&#13;
much bigger, and set the wayi we sort of updated it, looked at new&#13;
&#13;
budgets, oil prices.         I guess the only issue left unsettled was&#13;
&#13;
whether they should have their own water resources or import it from&#13;
&#13;
the Shatt-al-Arab, and they wisely decided that they would have some&#13;
&#13;
of their own, so they built a distillation plant.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        Now, your role on the Bell mission to India.&#13;
&#13;
A:        Beginning with the end, I did an independent report called&#13;
&#13;
"Controls on Foreign Exchange and Investment," or something like that,&#13;
11&#13;
     Administrative controls".     By "independent" I mean that it was a&#13;
separate volume. It did not begin that way.           When I first met Bernie&#13;
&#13;
in June or thereabouts we talked more about planning, which is what I&#13;
&#13;
started to prepare. When he arrived with Ken Bohr and company, he&#13;
&#13;
thought, and so did Ken, that I would be working with Ken Bohr. I&#13;
&#13;
decided I had not come to India for that, and David Holland, whom I&#13;
&#13;
had not met before, intervened and in the end they agreed that this&#13;
&#13;
would be my section, import controls and investment controls.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        This was--&#13;
&#13;
A:                     The first Bell mission.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        This report,    I mean, like all the rest of the Bell mission&#13;
&#13;
reports, was never issued in even in green cover.&#13;
&#13;
A:        No.   That isn't so at all.    Excuse me.   These reports were&#13;
&#13;
circulated to the Consortium members and to the Government of India.&#13;
&#13;
They were not issued to the Board.         So I don't remember the color of&#13;
&#13;
the cover because they were not strictly Board documents, but they&#13;
&#13;
very much did go to the Governments. We did have discussions. My&#13;
&#13;
friendship with and respect for Bhoothalingam date to that time, when&#13;
&#13;
he was very kind to me during the discussions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        You went in '65 to discuss this report?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Baneth, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
A:    That, frankly,    I don't recall.     There should be records of it.&#13;
The second Bell mission was in the spring of '66, if I am not&#13;
mistaken.&#13;
Q:    By the second Bell mission do you mean Bell and de Lattre and--?&#13;
A:    No. Bell and de Lattre started in '65.            Let me just try to think&#13;
about that.     We were still sitting together in the G Street building,&#13;
when Bell and de Lattre and David Holland went back to India and&#13;
discussed, in effect, devaluation.        Then they came back suddenly, very&#13;
mysteriously, very hush-hush.     You remember David was always very&#13;
hush-hush. They did not say anything, but then de Lattre told Bernie&#13;
that, as I was dealing with a similar topic, they really had to tell&#13;
me; that was more in the French Civil Service tradition, rather than&#13;
&#13;
the American.     So, in fact, they called me one evening,         David&#13;
Holland, de Lattre, Bernie and myself, and they told me why they had&#13;
come back, that they had discussed devaluation, and had to come back&#13;
to discuss various implications. They did not give me full details but&#13;
&#13;
only some of the basic points.&#13;
      I think we were still writing then, so we could not yet have&#13;
discussed the chapters in India at that point.            Then I went on a&#13;
mission to Iran.     It must have been before the devaluation, so it may&#13;
have been in the framework of the second Bell mission that we had&#13;
these detailed discussions with the Indians.            I don't recall exactly.&#13;
But the Bell Mission reports had been circulated.            Or maybe it was&#13;
while we were still in Delhi that we discussed them with the Indians?.&#13;
I have not seen anything referring to that particular period among my&#13;
&#13;
papers.&#13;
Q:    Can you say something--&#13;
A:    But I do remember the meeting, very specifically, Khrisnamoorthy&#13;
and Bhoothalingam were objecting to what I said about something&#13;
concerning the foreign exchange budget being       11&#13;
                                                        played by the ear".    I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     13&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Baneth, Page 14&#13;
remember the pretty detailed Indian discussion, but I can't put a date&#13;
&#13;
on   it.&#13;
Q:         Can you say something about the general purpose of the Bell&#13;
&#13;
mission, and also what in your view really speaks about this Bell&#13;
&#13;
mission?&#13;
&#13;
A:         Well, to back a little, as you said. At the meeting discussing&#13;
&#13;
Bernie 1 s $900 million recommendations, an economic Committee, or maybe&#13;
&#13;
Loan Committee meeting, one of the Bank dignitaries said that he was&#13;
&#13;
puzzled to see that India still needed borrowing.       He thought that,&#13;
&#13;
given all these years, they should have developed, that they would no&#13;
&#13;
longer need help. I think part of the thing was this feeling. You had&#13;
&#13;
the first Consortium, the first foreign exchange crisis in '59--&#13;
&#13;
Q:         '58.&#13;
&#13;
A:         '58, and it became repetitive, things were not getting better,&#13;
&#13;
then arose a major concern with agriculture because of the ballooning&#13;
&#13;
of the P.L. 480 imports and the feeling that the Indians were not&#13;
&#13;
taking that seriously.       Basically USAID, and perhaps some of the&#13;
&#13;
others, said "Okay, we can continue with this game but you really have&#13;
&#13;
to see how often you are going to need help again."       I   suspect that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank economic reports that were then written by Peter Wright may&#13;
&#13;
not have been believed. This may be unfair, but there may have been a&#13;
&#13;
feeling that they were not searching enough.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         But it is your sense that the push to carry out this diagnostic&#13;
&#13;
was really brought from the various members of the consortium?           It was&#13;
&#13;
not a kind of Bank--?&#13;
&#13;
A:         It was a push from the outside by the various members, who were&#13;
&#13;
equal,      in the sense that Nikita divided his money equally.   Tsar&#13;
&#13;
Nicolas used to send money to Nikita of Montenegro to divide equally&#13;
&#13;
among his people, and Nikita would get the people together and say,&#13;
&#13;
okay, we'll divide this equally, one for the people and one for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       14&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Baneth, Page 15&#13;
Nikita, one for the people and one for Nikita ....   In reality, the&#13;
&#13;
Consortium was the U.S.   The U.S. in those days usually wanted half of&#13;
&#13;
all commitments to come from non-U.S. sources.    So there was a big&#13;
&#13;
U.S. push, but it did not go against the grain of the others.     I think&#13;
&#13;
the others were not at all unhappy, but probably it originated with&#13;
&#13;
the U.S. and probably that was why the Bank got Bernie Bell. I was not&#13;
&#13;
privy to the gods, but my impression was the reason they had picked on&#13;
&#13;
an outsider is that they wanted to establish this as a slightly&#13;
&#13;
independent sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Right.   In the Indian perception, Woods is sometimes being&#13;
&#13;
depicted as the kind of person who pushed us all, ultimately also&#13;
&#13;
pushed for intervention in their policies and so on,   --&#13;
&#13;
A:    It depends whose Indian perception. India turned against him&#13;
&#13;
partly because of his UNCTAD speech. I was in Delhi, when the Indians&#13;
&#13;
picked on his phrase "India is not the only country where hope has&#13;
&#13;
dwindled into despondency."   And of course there had been the&#13;
&#13;
devaluation. In those days, and this is difficult to explain to&#13;
&#13;
youngsters/ in those days devaluation was something terrible.     When&#13;
&#13;
Bernie came back in early '66 you had this cartoon, the Rupee shown as&#13;
&#13;
a chicken running away and a hawk coming down as Bell, and Morarji&#13;
&#13;
Desai as the hen who tried protect the chicken. There was also a&#13;
&#13;
headline in Blitz, in huge characters,   "To hell with Bell."&#13;
&#13;
      But I don't think it came from Woods.   Woods may have understood&#13;
&#13;
it, may have relayed it. I think the Indians knew very well that the&#13;
&#13;
push was general. And don't forget that these were also the days in&#13;
&#13;
'65 when they had the war with Pakistan, when the Americans were, for&#13;
&#13;
the first, not for the last time, "tilting .. for Pakistan, or at least&#13;
&#13;
that was what the Indians thought. You had the food crisis, and&#13;
&#13;
Johnson was doling out the food month by month, I think for basically&#13;
&#13;
good reasons, to push the Indians to do something about their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   15&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 16&#13;
  agricultural policy 12 .    But it was perceived as terribly dishonoring.&#13;
&#13;
            So I doubt that I. G. Patel or Ashok Mitra (Manmohan Singh in&#13;
&#13;
  fact was not involved in those days) or Manu Shroff, who was involved,&#13;
&#13;
  I don't think they got the impression that it was Woods's initiative.&#13;
&#13;
  Nor did, by the way,       Bhoothalingam have that impression at all. They&#13;
&#13;
  did not think that George Woods had organized it all.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Looking back at the work that was done by the Bell missions, the&#13;
&#13;
  recommendations and the discussions with the Indians and what they&#13;
&#13;
  did, what is your assessment?       Would you think that this was all a&#13;
&#13;
  futile exercise?&#13;
&#13;
  A:        No.   One part of it was a catastrophe, in that devaluation was&#13;
&#13;
  totally inadequate, given all the rest.       Stanley Please and I had&#13;
&#13;
  written a note a few weeks before, where we said that something in the&#13;
&#13;
  range of 10 to 15 rupees per dollar, and better 15 than 10, would be&#13;
&#13;
  adequate.       Right after the devaluation I wrote several memos, and&#13;
&#13;
  those should be in the files, which said that most of the engineering&#13;
&#13;
  and similar exports actually suffered from the devaluation.       They had&#13;
&#13;
  a worse rate of exchange after the devaluation than before, because of&#13;
&#13;
  subsidies withdrawn and all that.       And I had another report that I&#13;
&#13;
  wrote a little later, post-devaluation, must have been in late      1&#13;
                                                                          66.&#13;
&#13;
  Basically it looked at the Fourth Plan's export targets.       What it said&#13;
&#13;
  was that overall, this was a wonderful export target, seven percent&#13;
&#13;
  export growth, beautiful. Then look at this commodity by commodity.&#13;
&#13;
  In tea you cannot make it, in jute you cannot make it,      in iron ore you&#13;
&#13;
  cannot make it, you should still make the targets, so what you need is&#13;
&#13;
  more stimulus in the non-traditional manufacturing exports.       And it is&#13;
&#13;
  difficult to say that, no matter how politely, without somebody&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       12&#13;
      India imported over ten million tons of foodgrains in&#13;
both 1966 and 1967, most of it financed by the US under PL&#13;
480.&#13;
&#13;
                                         16&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Baneth, Page 17&#13;
  reading     11&#13;
                   exchange ratesn into it; this is exactly what they did read&#13;
&#13;
  into it, which is exactly what was meant 13      .   So I think that was a big&#13;
&#13;
  problern. 14&#13;
&#13;
           But we were not the only ones pushing for devaluation. You know&#13;
&#13;
  that Jagdish Bhagwati and T. N. Srinivasan, who were already well&#13;
&#13;
  known University Professors, had gone to see Mrs. Gandhi and they were&#13;
&#13;
  really pretty important in pushing her in the devaluation direction.&#13;
&#13;
  Nobody knows how important, who caused her to take the decision. But&#13;
&#13;
  whoever it was, the biggest problem afterwards was that the measure&#13;
&#13;
  she had been pushed to take did not work, because it had not gone far&#13;
&#13;
  enough.&#13;
&#13;
           There was a lack of clarity on the aid that would be coming, the&#13;
&#13;
  famous $900 million.          It was never quite clear whether it was $900&#13;
&#13;
  million per annum forever in non-project aid, or $900 million for one&#13;
&#13;
  year, and bas 15 ; this was one problem.       It did not come, perhaps,&#13;
&#13;
  quite as fast as was expected; but contrary to what the Indians say, I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      13&#13;
       The "they" here is more the IMF than the Indian&#13;
Government. The IMF Department Director was Savkar, a Reserve&#13;
Bank of India man; and I believe it was the IMF that advised&#13;
the Indian Government that the 7.5 rate was just dandy. Later,&#13;
when Savkar and Jack Woodley arched over to Cargill's office&#13;
to protest against my export report, Woodley seemed to think I&#13;
was right - but Savkar maintained that the devaluation had&#13;
been sufficient and India was well set to meet its export&#13;
targets.&#13;
      14&#13;
        I remember a Department meeting much later, probably in&#13;
late 1967 or 1968. In those days, Departments still met&#13;
regularly, weekly. Peter Cargill spoke about Indian exports,&#13;
how they had been projected to rise by 7 percent, and did not.&#13;
Then he asked me if I had anything to add. And I said,&#13;
plaintively, "You keep on harping about those 7%. There is&#13;
nothing wrong with the 7% projection". You should have seen&#13;
his look of surprise. Then I added. "The only problem is that&#13;
they went down and not up". Which is indeed what had happened,&#13;
a 7% decline in exports.&#13;
      15&#13;
           Enough (Hindi) .&#13;
&#13;
                                            17&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Baneth, Page 18&#13;
  do not think that was the main problem.&#13;
&#13;
        But India did have a second bad crop, and that was a problem.&#13;
&#13;
 They did have a devaluation which was inadequate.       And they did not&#13;
&#13;
  lift the controls enough to provoke the domestic competition which&#13;
&#13;
  might have raised efficiency; or rather, they lifted them a little,&#13;
&#13;
 but it hurt, so they re-imposed controls.&#13;
&#13;
        My favorite example is the wire drawers. Anyone who just had a&#13;
&#13;
  small copper quota and used about one percent or whatever of their&#13;
&#13;
  capacity, had made a huge profit because they resold the copper wire.&#13;
&#13;
  Some of them just resold the copper, which did give them an even&#13;
&#13;
 bigger profit.     And suddenly everybody, more or less, could import&#13;
&#13;
  copper but had to pay much more for it. Then they said, "this is a&#13;
&#13;
  tough business.    How ridiculous!   The government is making all this&#13;
&#13;
  copper allocation, much more than anyone needs!" So there was much&#13;
&#13;
  clamoring, because for the first time they had to compete a little&#13;
&#13;
 among each other, and they found out that competition could hurt. So&#13;
&#13;
  licensing was pretty soon tightened.      Contributing to this tightening&#13;
&#13;
  was that the foreign exchange situation still looked tight; the&#13;
&#13;
  Indians needed more of all sorts things not financed by aid, and the&#13;
&#13;
  aid itself was not coming as soon as needed; debt service Was also&#13;
&#13;
  mounting and this was before the debt relief started actually working.&#13;
&#13;
 Also, engineering exports and the like went down, because all their&#13;
&#13;
  subsidies had been lifted and the devaluation stimulus was not enough.&#13;
&#13;
  so Mrs. Gandhi decided that this had not been a good thing; and the&#13;
&#13;
  bitter feeling remained for a long time 16 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     16&#13;
        Because she had sacrificed enormous political capital in&#13;
going in for those reforms, and she did it because she had&#13;
believed that they would work fast. As we know from the&#13;
structural adjustment experience, these things rarely produce&#13;
results very fast even when adequate; and in India the&#13;
measures were not adequate.&#13;
&#13;
                                       18&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth, Page 19&#13;
        But I think the Bell Mission was, by itself, all right; the&#13;
&#13;
 advice it gave was not bad. I think we had not clarified enough what&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund's role was. Savkar, their Asia Department Director, was ...&#13;
&#13;
  Is this is being tape recorded? Let us say he was a beep, beep. Jack&#13;
&#13;
 Woodley, who was his deputy would have agreed with my assessment; he&#13;
&#13;
 would also have said that Savkar was a beep beep.    And the Bell&#13;
&#13;
 reports were variable in quality.    I think the family planning people&#13;
&#13;
 did contribute to a push, but they were too simplistic.    I remember&#13;
&#13;
 their going to a meeting, twiddling their IUD 17 s. They were peddling&#13;
&#13;
 them without taking into account that Indian women were very feeble&#13;
&#13;
 and also had other problems.   The agricultural team, on the other&#13;
&#13;
 hand, started a long-standing relationship. I would not say that it&#13;
&#13;
 was just thanks to the World Bank and John Crawford single-handed that&#13;
&#13;
  India reformed agricultural policy, but she did, in fact, very&#13;
&#13;
 successfully reform agricultural policy, along the lines suggested by&#13;
&#13;
 the Bell mission.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     But in the negotiations I suppose the fact that the focus became&#13;
&#13;
  so exclusive on the devaluation, on the exchange rate, in a sense&#13;
&#13;
 mopped up the works and in a sense it might have been much more&#13;
&#13;
 effective if there had been a broader--&#13;
&#13;
 A:     It was broader. If you look at the minutes, I just looked at&#13;
&#13;
 them a couple of days ago, is it Ashok Mehta I mean?&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     Yes. The Planning Minister.&#13;
&#13;
 A:     Yes. His discussions with Woods did cover a broad front. In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      17 Intra&#13;
            Uterine Devices (IUD) were then quite novel, and&#13;
the Bell mission's family planning people were relying on it&#13;
almost exclusively, and with immense, and simplistic optimism.&#13;
Bernie seemed to believe them. I recall his writing something&#13;
extremely optimistic in his summary report; something about&#13;
some very low birth rate being capable of being reached by&#13;
some target rate. Even the usually reserved David Holland&#13;
commented on this that, if indeed that happened, he would make&#13;
the pilgrimage to Badrinath on his knees.&#13;
&#13;
                                      19&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Baneth, Page 20&#13;
end,   it did focus much more on the devaluation than, perhaps, on the&#13;
&#13;
rest, because at some point the Bank left the Fund take the lead on&#13;
&#13;
this, and the Fund's focus was devaluation.       If you focus on one&#13;
&#13;
thing, you bloody better get it right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       What do you say about Bernie Bell?    Was he the right man for the&#13;
&#13;
job?     Was he the right man to sell the reforms to the Indians?&#13;
&#13;
A:       Yes.   I think Bernie was the right man in many areas.      There&#13;
&#13;
were other right men, but Bernie was the right man in a way, low-key&#13;
&#13;
and extraordinarily persistent. He really was the iron hand in the&#13;
&#13;
velvet glove.&#13;
&#13;
         I don't know.   Maybe he was, but maybe he had to be.    At least&#13;
&#13;
his original conception was perhaps simplistic, perhaps he did not&#13;
&#13;
look enough at State-level things.      Supposing your federal, Union,&#13;
&#13;
controls had all been lifted, bang!, I am not sure that would have&#13;
&#13;
necessarily been all the better, if you had all the State controls&#13;
&#13;
still there. I am now guessing. I cannot redo history.       Also,    I was&#13;
&#13;
not in the heart of things.      I only knew about some of these things&#13;
&#13;
because de Lattre insisted that I should.       But usually Bernie did keep&#13;
&#13;
things very close to his chest.&#13;
&#13;
         But I know his relations were not bad.    I know he got good&#13;
&#13;
relations with Bhoothalingam and others.       I know that many people in&#13;
&#13;
India appreciated the need for fairly radical reforms.       I guess some&#13;
&#13;
of them would have preferred to forego the appearance of this outside&#13;
&#13;
pressure, because there was considerable inside movement also, but I&#13;
&#13;
don't know how it would have happened otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
         But, again, this is like Carter rescuing the hostages in Iran.&#13;
&#13;
If the two helicopters had not crashed, had it worked, everybody would&#13;
&#13;
have applauded "What a daring mission!"       But the helicopters did&#13;
&#13;
crash,    in reality. The devaluation did not get the foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
rate right.     At some time in the early 1970s, we had a discussion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      20&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 21&#13;
  about this at a seminar in Manila.     It was the NCAER    project on trade&#13;
&#13;
  policy reform or some such thing.     Jagdish Bhagwati and T. N.&#13;
&#13;
  Srinivasan presented a paper, of which I was the discussant.       so the&#13;
&#13;
  analysis of this issue is on the record, in the book somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
          Basically, our analyses on what the pre-devaluation rates were,&#13;
&#13;
 were sort of uncertain 18 . We should have compensated by saying,    "you&#13;
&#13;
  better overdo it". Doing a small step in the right direction is worse&#13;
&#13;
  than doing nothing at all, because you discredit the small step''.&#13;
&#13;
 And there,     I think the responsibility belongs much more to the IMF&#13;
&#13;
  than to us.    If I may jump a little, a few years later I was involved&#13;
&#13;
  in Burma, and Burma was going to the dogs. Well, it wasn't going, it&#13;
&#13;
 was there. And the IMF had Tun Thin as Head of the Department in those&#13;
&#13;
 days, and Tun Thin was Burmese, and many years later he went back to&#13;
&#13;
  Burma to work with the junta. And they had these huge talks, and&#13;
&#13;
  finally announced agreement, and the Burmese devalued. well, the&#13;
&#13;
  Burmese devalued from 4.76 kyats to 5.30 per dollar. You could not&#13;
&#13;
  even talk about an equilibrium rate short of 25 kyats per dollar,&#13;
&#13;
 maybe. In such cases, you have a big, huge political effort, and in&#13;
&#13;
  the end you have a change which does not bring any meaningful change.&#13;
&#13;
 Then all the others who said you were wrong, that the country did not&#13;
&#13;
  really need this change, say,    "see, we were right".    And that is&#13;
&#13;
  exactly what happened in India.&#13;
&#13;
          If you had had devaluation to a rate of 12 or 13 rupees to the&#13;
&#13;
  dollar,   it would have cut down on demand for imports very seriously,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     18&#13;
       The official rate was, of course, 4.76 rupees to the&#13;
dollar; but effective rates were determined by a combination&#13;
of many subsidies, most of them in kind (e. g. import&#13;
entitlements), whose total impact was very difficult to&#13;
measure; even more difficult to aggregate and express as a&#13;
single average number.&#13;
     19&#13;
       I expressed "Baneth's law of small steps" at that NCAER&#13;
conference.&#13;
                                       21&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Baneth, Page 22&#13;
  it would have allowed some foreign exchange abundance. Firms that were&#13;
&#13;
  using imports that had been       rationed, and were therefore non-&#13;
&#13;
  competing, would have been forced into competition and greater&#13;
&#13;
  efficiency; exports would have become attractive and the Indians would&#13;
&#13;
  have got into exports much earlier than they actually did, and much&#13;
&#13;
  more seriously than they are doing even now20 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        You liked India sufficiently to volunteer for--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Oh, yes.   I liked India.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         For a resident assignment?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Yes.   In fact, I can say I was considering leaving the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
  those days, and I had two interesting offers.       One of them was for a&#13;
&#13;
 private firm, and the other one was the OECD.        And I decided against&#13;
&#13;
  it because then it appeared that there was a good chance I would be&#13;
&#13;
 going to India. I had already decided when Peter or Ray Goodman&#13;
&#13;
  finally told me about it - no, it was Peter who told me about the&#13;
&#13;
 assignments and said,       "Well, I hear that you are considering leaving&#13;
&#13;
  the Bank, and we don't want to send people in the field only because&#13;
&#13;
  they would otherwise leave", and I said,      "No, no! I already told OECD&#13;
&#13;
  and the other guys that I am not going."       But, frankly, that was in&#13;
&#13;
  large part because there was, not a promise but a good possibility, of&#13;
&#13;
 my going to India.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         From an economic standpoint, also, you felt that India had a lot&#13;
&#13;
  of untapped potential?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         I think that is true. And there was the possibility for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       20&#13;
       I guess this does not really answer the question about&#13;
the rightness of Bernie. His analysis may have been a little&#13;
simplistic - IMF or not, I would have fought like a tiger&#13;
against a 7.5 rate (but then~ never made it to VP). On the&#13;
other hand, despite the publicity and the pressure, I believe&#13;
Bernie managed to keep good relations with the Indians, better&#13;
ones than many a Bank man with less difficult missions on&#13;
hand.&#13;
                                         22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 23&#13;
  research, and I loved the country, and I felt that I was getting on&#13;
&#13;
  very well with the Indians, which I guess was true.        So all of that.&#13;
&#13;
  Not that the country cannot be infuriating.        It was often very&#13;
&#13;
  infuriating.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        What was your responsibility in that--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        When I went out Bob Sadove was the Head-designate, and then&#13;
&#13;
  Sadove changed his mind, and in the end it was Gil who came out, but&#13;
&#13;
  quite a bit later. At some point I was more or less the only general&#13;
&#13;
  economist, and then Gil came out and then Basil Kawalsky carne out; so&#13;
&#13;
  my responsibilities varied.       Basically I--&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        And Ken Bohr 1 wasn't he there?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         That is right.   Ken Bohr in fact went out before me, but he was&#13;
&#13;
  sort of dealing with the industrial sector. When I had come back from&#13;
&#13;
  the Bell mission, the first Bell mission, I went back to the Middle&#13;
&#13;
  East and I went on a mission to Iran.       And then they kept calling me&#13;
&#13;
  for India things from time to time. Then there was the second mission,&#13;
&#13;
  well, Stanley Katz wrote the report, but I think Bernie had led the&#13;
&#13;
 mission.       And after, at some point I was shifted formally to the India&#13;
&#13;
 Division and I got involved with debt and debt relief, and in fact I&#13;
&#13;
  travelled all over the world, well, no, I guess all over Europe,&#13;
&#13;
  discussing "how much do the Indians owe you?"        "Gee, let me look in&#13;
&#13;
  that drawer there, you know," For an economist, that was quite a&#13;
&#13;
  surprise, that one had to work hard to get even an approximative idea&#13;
&#13;
  about debt figures 21 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       21&#13;
      I do not recall, and I am not sure I ever fully knew the&#13;
exact genesis of the quest for debt relief; in particular, to&#13;
what extent it constituted quantitative addition to non-&#13;
project aid, or a change in its form only. The rationale&#13;
exposed to the donors, however, dealt only with form: "non-&#13;
project aid is fine, but free foreign exchange is needed to&#13;
pay for imports which nonproject aid does not finance, like&#13;
fuel, fertilizers and non-ferrous metals; and also to pay for&#13;
services, in particular freight. So once debt had been&#13;
&#13;
                                         23&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 24&#13;
           Anyway, so I was dealing with debt before I went out.     I had&#13;
&#13;
  that. David Holland had dealt with exports on the Bell mission, but&#13;
&#13;
  then left the Bank, so on the second Bell mission I dealt with the&#13;
&#13;
  foreign sector in general, exports and so on. And I guess I started&#13;
&#13;
  dealing with birth       controls - jokingly, I said that it was easy to&#13;
&#13;
  move from import controls to birth control; in reality, I was&#13;
&#13;
  interested in the issue, so I wrote the family planning sections also&#13;
&#13;
  in the economic reports.      Once,   I wrote in the population section of a&#13;
&#13;
  report that "some people think that the Indian population will go on&#13;
&#13;
  increasing until there is standing room only, which should by itself&#13;
  cut down population growth."      Somebody here at Headquarters objected&#13;
&#13;
  that the Indians would be very offended by that, but I could point out&#13;
&#13;
  that the only remark the Indians had made was that if I believed that,&#13;
&#13;
  I obviously had not looked at Khajuraho yet 22 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
           So, I dealt with these things.     Foreign sector and family&#13;
&#13;
 planning, and I guess in some ways I was second man to Gil on the&#13;
&#13;
  economic side.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        The economic report in those days, of course, was written&#13;
&#13;
  specially in the field?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Yes.   Right.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        And so you continued doing this until you came back to--&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Except that they picked me up in '69 to lead the economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
serviced, India would not be able to pay for such essentials.&#13;
It could be helped through debt relief, or through free&#13;
foreign exchange loans, which the IDA Industrial Imports&#13;
Credits closely resembled.&#13;
      22&#13;
      For the benefit of those future readers who have not&#13;
heard of Khajuraho, it is a group of temples covered with&#13;
statuary that indeed demonstrates that the availability of&#13;
standing room only indeed need not cut down on the activities&#13;
that, before the advent of in vitro fertilization, were a&#13;
necessary, though not sufficient, condition of population&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;
                                         24&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 25&#13;
mission to Iran, and in '70 to masquerade as a rice expert with a Fund&#13;
mission to Burma.&#13;
Q:       This was because they had a problem here at that point or you--&#13;
A:       I imagine so, yes.&#13;
Q:       --you kind of expressed an interest in this?&#13;
A:       No.   I was totally happy in India.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       And were there any particular issues that--&#13;
A:       In Iran--&#13;
&#13;
Q:       --you dealt with in those missions?&#13;
A:       There must have been because I remember that the previous report&#13;
&#13;
had started with something like "Iran's plan is very ambitious,&#13;
perhaps too ambitious," so I started mine by saying "Iran's plan is&#13;
very ambitious but perhaps not ambitious enough."            In other words, I&#13;
think there was an issue, as there usually is in Iran. Whether it was&#13;
an issue before I went out, or whether I realized it when I was there,&#13;
I frankly don't remember; but there was an obvious issue of&#13;
overspending in the military, and how did you put that down was a&#13;
delicate thing. It was also delicate because we had made assessments&#13;
of resources, then the Shah went and saw the oil companies, and banged&#13;
on the table, and the resources doubled! So it was a bit delicate to&#13;
tell him, "Your Majesty, you are wrong", but clearly the major issue&#13;
was that.&#13;
&#13;
         They were doing quite well on incentives, they did not have too&#13;
high protection, they were doing very well on education, he had just&#13;
launched his Peace Corps in a way,      it was his   11&#13;
                                                          education corps 11   ,   and&#13;
so on.     No, it was fairly impressive in many respects but he was&#13;
compromising progress because there was a big chunk of overspending.&#13;
There were huge sectoral organization problems in agriculture, and in&#13;
general, I guess; organizational problems in the sense that they had&#13;
&#13;
confused lines of responsibility. Of course, that was not because the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      25&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Baneth, Page 26&#13;
  Shah did not know what he was doing; it was because he knew exactly&#13;
&#13;
  what he was doing, and he did not want to give too much responsibility&#13;
&#13;
  to anybody.     That stayed that way.&#13;
        In Burma, the problem was that, after the second time that Ne&#13;
  Win came to power,     the Burmese broke all relations with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  They did not leave the Bank, they just did not want to borrow, no&#13;
  mission, no nothing&#13;
&#13;
        [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 1]&#13;
  They also did not borrow from the IMF, but they continued as members&#13;
  in good standing, and therefore they had these regular consultations.&#13;
&#13;
  Then, in early 1970, the opportunity arose for the Bank to attach&#13;
  someone to a Fund mission; and someone,           I suppose Peter Cargill who&#13;
&#13;
  had got to know me in the course of his visits to India, chose me. I&#13;
&#13;
  went as a member of the Fund mission, though the Burmese knew I was&#13;
&#13;
  from the Bank, of course.     In principle, I was to look at investment,&#13;
&#13;
  but in reality to prepare for possible resumption of relations, which&#13;
&#13;
  then happened some months later. And I also led the first economic&#13;
  mission to Burma in '71, but by that time I had come back to&#13;
&#13;
  Headquarters.&#13;
  Q:    But it was already apparent that Burma was sort of a special&#13;
&#13;
  case of a very kind of closed up probate care.&#13;
&#13;
  A:    Considering that tourists could get visas for only 24 hours,&#13;
&#13;
  which I guess limits tourism, yes, it was fairly clear they were&#13;
&#13;
  special. They were steeped in the       11&#13;
                                               Bunnese way to socialism 11 , very,&#13;
&#13;
  very touchily nationalistic. That is why one had to make a special&#13;
&#13;
  effort to visit and sort of explain and gradually prepare a mission.&#13;
&#13;
  We had tried to persuade Peter 23 before the Annual Meeting at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     23&#13;
        Peter Cargill. He had been Director of the East Asia&#13;
Department. When Escott Reid, Director of South Asia and&#13;
Middle East retired in 1964, Alexander (Sandy) Stevenson&#13;
succeeded him. Then, after a while, George Woods decided that&#13;
&#13;
                                          26&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Baneth, Page 27&#13;
  Copenhagen, which happened soon after my mission      I don't know&#13;
  exactly what year that was.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:    '70.&#13;
&#13;
  A:    '70.   We tried to pressure Peter that when he met with the&#13;
&#13;
  Burmese he should offer them Bank help; Peter's position was that he&#13;
&#13;
  was damned if he did that if the Burmese did not ask for it. Having&#13;
&#13;
  decided that, he did in fact ask the Head of the Burmese delegation, a&#13;
&#13;
  charming man, the Governor of the Central Bank, whether there was&#13;
&#13;
  anything the Bank could do to help, and he replied:    "Yes.   You could&#13;
  send us some books on development." But the Burmese position did&#13;
&#13;
  really evolve, and a few months later they did ask for a mission. I&#13;
&#13;
  was sent out with a team and we did both project identification and&#13;
&#13;
  economic work, and in fact several of the first loans were for&#13;
&#13;
  projects we had suggested.&#13;
&#13;
        I had said we have to do things without any macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
  condition for a couple of years, because the Burmese would probably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was not a good idea, and to solve what, in those more&#13;
considerate days, was a problem, re-united to the Departments&#13;
 (separated only in 1960 or '61) into a single Asia Department,&#13;
with Cargill as Director, his previous Deputy, Ray Goodman, as&#13;
Deputy Director, and Stevenson Associate Director for a while,&#13;
before he moved over to become Deputy Director of the Economic&#13;
Staff. The Asia Department was again split into South and East&#13;
Asia (the latter under Ray Goodman) in 1968 or 1969. Then, in&#13;
1972, the Asia Region was formed, with Cargill as Vice-&#13;
President, I as Chief economist, and Ray Goodman and Bill&#13;
Diamond respectively Directors of the East Asia and South Asia&#13;
Program Departments, and Merwyn Weiner as Director of the&#13;
Projects Department. When Cargill went to Finance as Senior&#13;
Vice-President in 1974, Asia was split again into East and&#13;
South, with Merwyn Weiner VP for the latter and Bernie Bell VP&#13;
for the former; and each had a single Program Department,&#13;
headed respectively by Bill Diamond (South) and Greg Votaw&#13;
 (East) - Ray Goodman refused to work under Bernie Bell). I am&#13;
writing this with a sense of awe and dismay, realizing that I&#13;
am writing it because I know that in today's Bank many people&#13;
do not know who Cargill was; and awe at the sic transit gloria&#13;
mundi.&#13;
&#13;
                                     27&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Baneth, Page 28&#13;
  throw us out if we started out with such conditionality; but for no&#13;
&#13;
  longer than a couple of years. I was anticipating radical reform.&#13;
&#13;
  Then, before I went out to Indonesia, in '75,           I wrote a memo to Merwyn&#13;
&#13;
  Wiener. By that time lending to Burma was in full swing.                 I said,&#13;
&#13;
  "Look,     this is nonsense; you cannot really think that small reforms&#13;
&#13;
  will achieve anything. You have to have radical reform, or you do not&#13;
&#13;
  even know if you are going in the right direction."&#13;
&#13;
            The following year, I was already in Indonesia and I read about&#13;
&#13;
  the Burma consortium. Ernie 24 was in charge by then.            I sent a memo&#13;
&#13;
  attaching the earlier one and repeating the same things, saying that&#13;
&#13;
  you could not pursue gradual reform in Burma.            So I had no illusion&#13;
&#13;
  about Burma. But it is a lovely country.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Especially then, I suppose.       Now, I guess--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         I haven't been back, so I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        --sort of broken down, and--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Well, it was pretty broken down by then.        I visited the shipyard&#13;
&#13;
  in Mandalay, a very good shipyard. And they had a machine which, even&#13;
&#13;
 by Burmese standards, looked rather old, so I            said,    "This machine&#13;
&#13;
  looks rather old even for you. It must date from before the First&#13;
&#13;
  World     War~   I bet."   And they said,    "First World War?    Hah~   hah.      We&#13;
&#13;
  bought this in 1876. Second hand."           It may not have been 1876, I don't&#13;
&#13;
  remember, but something like that.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Now, you came back from India in 1970?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         '70.    In rnid-'70, June.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        And then you became Senior Economist?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         That's right.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        That meant a step up?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       24&#13;
      For the benefit of future generations: Ernest Stern,&#13;
later Senior Vice-President, and then Managing Director; if&#13;
there was a Mister World Bank in the 1980s and early l990s,it&#13;
was he. "Sic transit . . ", indeed!&#13;
&#13;
                                              28&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Baneth, Page 29&#13;
  A:        Yes. They started grading at about that time, so I came back as&#13;
&#13;
  Grade B, but there had been some debate.              Greg'' kept saying things&#13;
&#13;
  about my being one of the        11&#13;
                                        mission leaders .. and so on, and I guess it&#13;
&#13;
  was Peter who decided that I should be the Senior Economist; the Chief&#13;
&#13;
  economist was Manfred Blobel. And it was a step up; at least,&#13;
&#13;
  certainly, that is how I looked at it. But not so much in grade terms&#13;
&#13;
  because those things were very new in those days.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        And it was--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        In real, yes, sure.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        This was in South Asia, then--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        I was in South Asia for nearly past--&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        (Inaudible)&#13;
&#13;
  A:        No.     It was Asia, when I joined it was South Asia.       In '65 it&#13;
&#13;
  became Asia, and in '69 or '70 it became South Asia again.              And it was&#13;
&#13;
  South Asia when I came back, until '72, when it became Asia.              Yes.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        So you were in the forefront--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         In South Asia front in those days there was one Chief Economist,&#13;
&#13;
  Manfred Blobel and many departments had two Senior Economists, but&#13;
&#13;
  South Asia only had one and it was I.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Uhuh.    And your responsibilities continued to be focused on&#13;
&#13;
  India very much?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Not particularly. We did not have that sort of division of&#13;
&#13;
  labor, and clearly Manfred was the superior and he decided what he&#13;
&#13;
  wanted to do and I took the rest.             But he wanted to get informed of&#13;
&#13;
  all things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       25&#13;
      Gregory Votaw. He had been a consultant on the Egypt&#13;
mission lead by Peter Wright in late 1962, and became a staff&#13;
member in early 1963. He replaced Jeffrey Davis (or Davies?)&#13;
as Division Chief for India in 1965 or 1966, and became&#13;
Cargill's Deputy Director when Asia was re-split in '68 or&#13;
'69.&#13;
                                               29&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Baneth, Page 30&#13;
           For India, the main responsibility still was in the field.&#13;
&#13;
 McDiarmid had replaced Gilmartin until Gilmartin again replaced&#13;
&#13;
 McDiarmid. They were clearly senior people, and they did not need my&#13;
&#13;
  supervision26 â&#128;¢ So my first mission, if I recall, went to Iran, then to&#13;
&#13;
 Sri Lanka. I worked on India from Headquarters,           I helped organize&#13;
&#13;
 missions and the like.&#13;
&#13;
           What else did we have?      We must have had Iran.     Of course we had&#13;
&#13;
  Iran, because I went out to Iran again.           I led a mission to Iran&#13;
&#13;
 again.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Until '72 when--&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Yes.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        --because a lot of stuff&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Yes.   Although I kept going out to Iran until '78.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        And then in--&#13;
&#13;
 A:        In '72, the reorganization, I became Chief Economist.                  I was in&#13;
&#13;
 Paris.      In those days,   I knew vaguely there was some study on, but I&#13;
&#13;
  really did not bother about it at all.         I did not know what was going&#13;
&#13;
 on. And I was,      in '72 I was on horne leave.     A telephone call carne, it&#13;
&#13;
 was Peter.       "You know, we had the reorganization."        "Oh,   n   I said, I&#13;
&#13;
  really did not know about that.        He said,   "Burke Knappp becomes Senior&#13;
&#13;
  Vice President" (before, the Bank only had two Vice-Presidents). I&#13;
&#13;
  said,    "Oh, good.   Great news."     "And I become the Vice President for&#13;
&#13;
 East Asia, and Joe Doe becomes whatever."           And on and on, you know his&#13;
&#13;
 style. And finally he said, "and you are my Chief Economist.                11&#13;
                                                                                    I said,&#13;
&#13;
  "Your Chief Economist?"      I had not really thought that this was&#13;
&#13;
  coming, it was like a surprise, but a very pleasant one.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Yes.   I guess Manfred--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      26&#13;
       Both of them had been Economic Advisers, the equivalent&#13;
of what became the Chief Economist position after the 1972&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
                                           30&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Baneth, Page 31&#13;
  A:        Manfred had left.        Manfred had gone out to Thailand, and Mac"&#13;
&#13;
  was back and I guess the question was between Mac and maybe             Hablutzel&#13;
&#13;
  and myself.         Hablutzel thought he would be succeeding&#13;
  Q:        Manfred?&#13;
&#13;
  A:        No.     Wait a minute.     It can't work that way.   Because Manfred&#13;
&#13;
  was South Asia, and who was in East Asia?            East Asia--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         Well, and this was then Asia--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Oh, yeah.     Gil was going, East Asia was Gil and Gil was going&#13;
&#13;
 out to replace--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         McDiarmid.&#13;
&#13;
 A:         McDiarmid. And I think Hablutzel had thought he would succeed,&#13;
&#13;
 because I was told to handle him with great care when I came back,&#13;
&#13;
 which I did.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         Uhuh.      Now, any sort of highlights of your stint as Chief&#13;
&#13;
  Economist?&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Oh, God!     Well, one problem I remember and we had, all of us,&#13;
&#13;
  the first bunch, if I recall correctly, was Thompson, who was then&#13;
&#13;

            One issue 28 was, what does the Chief Economist do?       And one&#13;
&#13;
  interpretation was that he is sitting in his office, thinking deep&#13;
&#13;
  thoughts.         From time to time somebody comes in and asks him,     "Well,&#13;
  what do you think about this?" and then he gives his considered&#13;

        This makes terrible reading, but historical accuracy&#13;
compels me to leave it in - this is, after all, supposed to be&#13;
oral history. It makes terrible reading because, asked about&#13;
an important issue, I focus on an issue of organization, or&#13;
administration, or prestige. Of course, there were many&#13;
substantive issues - Bangla Desh, the oil crisis, the Third&#13;
Window", lending to Indochina, Burma. I may take some of these&#13;
up in endnotes.&#13;
&#13;
                                              31&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Baneth, Page 32&#13;
opinion.            It was not quite like that, but there was a problem. The&#13;
&#13;
only formal power he had, in a sense, was to say, "This report is&#13;
&#13;
wrong". If people had some intelligence, they would come to him&#13;
earlier, but it was not a very happy arrangement, and clearly the&#13;
weight, not only of the Department Directors but even of the Division&#13;
Chiefs in some sense, was bigger because they were doing the loans,&#13;
the action, and what the Chief Economist could do was just say&#13;
"NO!   II â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Well, first let me backtrack.                 Peter clearly asked me to deal&#13;
&#13;
with project issues also.                   He had never looked at project documents,&#13;
really, and he asked my opinion.                   But Mervyn, who was a Project&#13;
Director, did not. I remember his first remark when I first looked at&#13;
some project,_it was the Karachi Port report. He said                    11&#13;
                                                                              Why didn't&#13;
Peter ask me for that?              11&#13;
                                         And sooner or later, I know that we had some&#13;
disagreement with Bill Diamond as to whether the Chief Economist could&#13;
give his opinion about country economists.&#13;
           I remember my once discussing with Ray Goodman an economist                     1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
then in South Asia, who was not very happy.                     I did not say that to&#13;
Ray.       I said, "maybe it's time for this guy to move on, and you have a&#13;
vacancy,            " and Bill [Diamond] took this very ill. I was not at all&#13;
conscious of doing anything behind his back, it was simply that he&#13;
would not want me even to think about staffing or economists'&#13;
performance; so that way, obviously, the Chief Economist had no sphere&#13;
of intervention.                It was a difficult situation, but those were the&#13;
days when           11&#13;
                         management 11 was beginning to be a big word in the Bank, and&#13;
the Chief economist as not "managing 11 anything. I felt very happy with&#13;
Peter Cargill because he was a wonderful man. As he once put it to me,&#13;
"Well, your problem is that you don't take fools lightly, but then&#13;
&#13;
it's not my problem because I'm not a fool," or words to that effect.&#13;
           It was all right with him. Even though he did not throw his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   32&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 33&#13;
  weight around much, actually, at least not at my behest, the&#13;
  possibility that he would do so was so frightening to most people that&#13;
  they paid a lot of attention to what I was saying.        And once he did&#13;
  stop a Country Program Paper (CPP), which was dreadful.        111111&#13;
                                 ~ -           and I had tried to tell him&#13;
  that this was a dreadful CPP on the Philippines, and I guess it did&#13;
  not register. So I told Peter, "You better postpone your meeting", and&#13;
  he did. That shook people up; it also made me undoubtedly extremely&#13;
  unpopular with a number of people.&#13;
             But it was very good to work with Peter. And then he left.      I&#13;
  had got along fine with Merwyn, but his Vice-Presidency was a one-&#13;
  Department affair 49 â&#128;¢ It had become more difficult for the Vice&#13;
  President, even more difficult for the Chief Economist.&#13;
  Q:         Many people in your position, of course, would eventually find&#13;
  themselves shift to the managerial side.&#13;
  A:         Well, I did.&#13;
  Q:         Well, you did eventually, but then you ended up in the economic&#13;
  complex.&#13;
  A:        No. The intermediate position was Indortesia, so I ended up in&#13;
  Indonesia.&#13;
  Q:         Okay.&#13;
  A:         In fact, I wanted to go out to India, but some other dreadful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       29&#13;
       South Asia and East Asia, put together to form the Asia&#13;
Vice-Presidency in 1972, were divorced into two Vice-&#13;
Presidencies in 1974. To recite their saga once and for all:&#13;
Asia was split up int two Program Departments in 1959 or 1960,&#13;
those two put together again in 1965, divorced in 1969 (or&#13;
therabouts), put together in 1972, divorced in 1974. That&#13;
separation lasted until 1987 - proving, I guess, that what&#13;
McNamarra destroyed stayed destroyed good. Then they were&#13;
again put together in 1987, and divorced by Preston in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
                                         33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            Baneth, Page 34&#13;
 guy got that position 30 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
 Q:   You never said,                  "Look, I mean,      this economic existence isn't going&#13;
&#13;
  to go anywhere.                  I better 11 - -&#13;
&#13;
 A:             I did.       Very clearly. I had illusions in those days, and I&#13;
&#13;
  thought that the Personnel Department chose personnel and so on, so I&#13;
&#13;
 wrote it in my annual performance report.                         I happen to remember&#13;
&#13;
 because I was packing the other day so I saw something I wrote.                               "Very&#13;
&#13;
 good,     11&#13;
                 I   said.        "I would be very happy to be a Chief Economist&#13;
&#13;
  forever,           if a Chief Economist actually could seriously influence&#13;
&#13;
  economic work.             11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                I was very unhappy about the project evaluation methods which&#13;
&#13;
 Van der Tak was developing.                         I thought that they induced cheating&#13;
&#13;
 among the project economists. The method was a joke. I was one of the&#13;
&#13;
  few Chief Economists who had really strong relations with the project&#13;
&#13;
 economists, and I saw the difficulties and pressures they faced. I&#13;
&#13;
 criticized the methodology; Hollis Chenery then created a committee to&#13;
&#13;
 review it, composed of Van der Tak, Bela Balassa and myself; but as&#13;
&#13;
 Bela put it, the two of us were always outvoted by Van der Tak31                          1&#13;
                                                                                               .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Then there were conflicts with Diamond, about CPPs which I thought&#13;
&#13;
 were really bad, but went ahead and then were sometimes criticized at&#13;
&#13;
  the President's review.&#13;
&#13;
                So I wrote,         "I would like to do this if it were doable.           I don't&#13;
&#13;
  think it is,           the way it is defined, so then I want to move on to&#13;
&#13;
  something else.                  There are precedents for moving directly to a&#13;
&#13;
  Director position, and I think I could do it as well as the next man,                            11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      30   As we both knew, that was Jochen Kraske himself.&#13;
      31I suppose that was because McNamara supported the&#13;
method - after all, if you believed in it, you could summarize&#13;
every project by a single number, the "economic rate of&#13;
return". This issue is still alive - see endnote 1.&#13;
&#13;
                                                          34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Baneth, Page 35&#13;
  or words to that effect.         "But that is so rare that it cannot be a&#13;
&#13;
  realistic expectation.         So what I would then aim at, is an overseas&#13;
&#13;
  assignment, and my preference would be to go out to India to replace&#13;
&#13;
  Gilmartin; but other missions would also be acceptable."         And I guess&#13;
&#13;
  I was fairly unhappy when Merwyn transmitted his recommendations for&#13;
&#13;
  India.         I thought it was perfectly reasonable for him to recommend&#13;
&#13;
  you, but I would have liked it mentioned that I was also a willing&#13;
&#13;
  candidate.        Anyway, it did not work out that way, but then, more or&#13;
&#13;
  less at the same time, it was decided to send me to Indonesia. In&#13;
&#13;
  those days, decisions concerning these missions were taken really by&#13;
&#13;
  McNamara and a small committee. It was not simply the Vice President&#13;
&#13;
  deciding it would be this guy.        He only made a   recommendation.   It&#13;
&#13;
  went to McNamara and McNamara, Peter Cargill and Burke Knapp, and a&#13;
&#13;
  couple of others, made the decision.&#13;
&#13;
            Q:      When you mentioned cheating, what kind of cheating was&#13;
&#13;
  this?&#13;
&#13;
  A:        Well, when you want to find 18 percent rate of return for a&#13;
&#13;
  project, or whatever it is that you want to find, it is easy to do so,&#13;
&#13;
  given the data requirements of the method'', given that nobody really&#13;
&#13;
  knows what the hell you are doing 33 , given that the alternative to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       32&#13;
      Most of the data needed are not actually known: they&#13;
must be estimated, within plausible ranges that are often&#13;
quite broad. Thus if one reasonable set of estimates does not&#13;
yield the rate of return the Bank hierarchy wants to show,&#13;
another set of estimates can be made that does show it, and&#13;
need not be wholly unreasonable.&#13;
       33&#13;
       Even in those days, few people bothered actually to&#13;
read and find out how the economist concerned had derived the&#13;
shadow prices on which the method is based, or, for that&#13;
matter, made other estimates. A quarter century later, few&#13;
project reports even indicate these derivations, so that most&#13;
readers could not find out what was done even if they wanted&#13;
to wade through the twelfth Annex, where the Economic rate of&#13;
return is usually discussed.&#13;
&#13;
                                          35&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Baneth, Page 36&#13;
  project is not shown. One of my first projects was (or contained) a&#13;
&#13;
  bridge in Karachi harbor. The rate of return calculation was based on&#13;
&#13;
  the assumption that, without the project, one day, poof!, the bridge&#13;
&#13;
  collapses. Therefore rebuilding it gets a very high rate of return.&#13;
&#13;
  But I said,            "Okay, but what about putting a little scotch tape or&#13;
&#13;
  chewing gum or a chain or something?"              It really was, and is, a&#13;
&#13;
  ridiculous methodology.             If you really want me to do so,      I can send&#13;
&#13;
  you the files on this. I again did a paper on this recently, but now&#13;
&#13;
  it looks like they won't publish it. So I have said,             11&#13;
                                                                        fine, I am going&#13;
&#13;
  to publish it outside the Bank, noting that it was censored by the&#13;
&#13;
  Banl2 411   â&#128;¢       I will not actually do it, because it may hurt the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
  image,          I   dare say, but I don't know.   You see those things are still a&#13;
&#13;
  live issue.&#13;
&#13;
            Anyway, that was that.         There was the whole idea, and&#13;
&#13;
  increasingly I became convinced that looking for the good projects and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       34&#13;
       As of my writing (Hanoi, Vietnam, 8 12 1995) the issue&#13;
is unresolved. Jim Adams, the man in charge, sent me the&#13;
manuscript to France, in April, with his proposed Preface&#13;
which states his disagreement with my analysis. I commented&#13;
that his Preface can contain anything he wants, though I&#13;
suggested something much lower key would be better, if indeed&#13;
he really thought he should write such a Preface at all; and I&#13;
sent back the manuscript and the diskette, for publication.&#13;
Three months later nothing had happened, except that he had&#13;
changed jobs; but when I saw him in Washington in July he&#13;
assured me he was still on top of things, and the manuscript&#13;
was well on its way to publication. I saw Richard Frank (MD)&#13;
in October, and spoke about the matter, and he sent he would&#13;
see to it. Myrna Alexander, who came to replace Jim Adams as&#13;
Director, OPR, called me in November, saying that she was in&#13;
charge now, she thought a dissenting Preface was uncalled for,&#13;
she would ensure the manuscript would be published, except&#13;
that nobody could find the diskette I had sent to Adams. I&#13;
sent her another one - and I am still waiting for news. For&#13;
the record, and to soothe my ego: Ernie Stern had asked to see&#13;
an earlier version, and wrote that my paper had been the only&#13;
Bank document he took on his long vacation in France, and he&#13;
had not been disappointed.&#13;
&#13;
                                               36&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 37&#13;
  then financing them, that is really not a proper way for the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
  focus on things.     What you have to look is   11&#13;
                                                       how can the Bank help the&#13;
&#13;
  country? ...&#13;
&#13;
           We are extraordinarily tolerant sometimes of mismanagement.&#13;
&#13;
 Burma is an example. I had pushed for going into Burma at the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning, because the regime there was perfectly happy to let&#13;
&#13;
 everybody starve, so you had to go in to give aid without&#13;
&#13;
 preconditions, to give some guarantee of your good faith; but then you&#13;
&#13;
 also had to put down your foot.      And we did not do that.       Basically&#13;
&#13;
 the Chief Economist had no power to make that happen. There was a&#13;
&#13;
 general feeling in those days of working on a sausage machine 35 , but&#13;
&#13;
  for a Chief Economist, committed to good economic performance and also&#13;
&#13;
  interested in project work, the pressure was particularly heavy. Also,&#13;
&#13;
  I liked contact with countries, I liked going out, I liked missions ...&#13;
&#13;
 So I did apply for a field assignment.&#13;
&#13;
           Before going out to Indonesia, by the way, Peter had got me&#13;
&#13;
  involved in Laos, before he became Senior V. P. So I went out on a&#13;
&#13;
 mission, before the Asia Region had been split. Then, when they split&#13;
&#13;
  the Region, Bernie Bell wanted me to go with him. Frankly, by that&#13;
&#13;
  time,    I recollect I thought that if I went to East Asia, then I would&#13;
&#13;
 have less of a basis for early transfer to the Field. East AsiA still&#13;
&#13;
 was, in a sense, relatively novel to me; I had not got as much&#13;
&#13;
  involved, because I had wanted to be very careful with Hablutzel. I&#13;
&#13;
 was also reluctant about becoming Chief Economist in East Asia because&#13;
&#13;
  I wanted Parvez Hassan to get a promotion; he could not very well get&#13;
&#13;
  it in south Asia.     Actually, I did not make the decision myself; Burke&#13;
&#13;
  Knapp decided, and I was informed when I was in Papua-New Guinea, that&#13;
&#13;
  it was to be South Asia. That was not against my wishes by any means,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      That had to churn out projects, no matter what. The&#13;
      35&#13;
&#13;
expression is, I believe, from Ben King.&#13;
&#13;
                                       37&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Baneth, Page 38&#13;
  partly because I thought that after a year that would give me a better&#13;
&#13;
  chance of getting to something else.&#13;
&#13;
            But I was involved in Laos. Ray Goodman had talks with the&#13;
&#13;
  Laotians, but that was really the Royal Government after the cease-&#13;
&#13;
  fire, and the ADB was all keen on going and making loans to Laos.&#13;
&#13;
  However, when I went out to Vientiane I realized that the Pathet Lao 36&#13;
&#13;
  side was still completely separate really, and they were considering&#13;
&#13;
  this loan, as were indeed the Royal side and, to some extent, the AID&#13;
&#13;
  people, as simply providing aid to what had been the anti-communist&#13;
&#13;
  side in the conflict. Now, I spent a year, which extended partly under&#13;
&#13;
  Bernie Bell, I went back several times and I led the economic mission.&#13;
&#13;
  I had agreed with Bernie Bell that though I did not go to East Asia, I&#13;
&#13;
  would go there as a mission chief, I would lead the work on Laos, and&#13;
&#13;
  I worked to get all the sides in the Laotian conflict to agree that&#13;
&#13;
  this was a good thing for Laos. In the end we did get agreement. When&#13;
&#13;
  the Aid Group meeting was organized, just before the fall of Saigon&#13;
&#13;
  actually, both sides were represented. After that, the Bank just went&#13;
&#13;
  right on and lent and maintained relations with Laos ever since 37 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
            So,   I was interested in going into the field, and going and&#13;
&#13;
  working with the governments and, after my disappointment that I was&#13;
&#13;
 not going to India, I was pretty happy to go to Indonesia. But that&#13;
&#13;
 was clearly seen as leading, or at least I hoped it would lead, to a&#13;
&#13;
  managerial position in operations.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        This, this work in Laos preceded your assignment to Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       36&#13;
       Ancient history again. The Royal Government" was run by&#13;
Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, once a neutralist&#13;
despised by the Americans and overthrown in a coup they had&#13;
engineered, but more recently the Great White Anticommunist&#13;
Hope. The Pathet Lao were the Communists, and in it Prince&#13;
Soupannouvong, a half-brother of t'other, played a high but&#13;
ceremonial role.&#13;
       37&#13;
            And the first loans were for projects we had identified.&#13;
&#13;
                                          38&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth, Page 39&#13;
A:    Yes.    It was finished, the AID group meeting was in the late&#13;
spring of '75.    I do not know whether I had been designated already,&#13;
&#13;
but probably not, because designation must have come in June, July or&#13;
&#13;
thereabout, of '75.     But I was no longer Chief Economist for that&#13;
&#13;
Region.    It was just as a continuation of earlier work, because I had&#13;
&#13;
gone off three or four times trying to get some sort of agreement by&#13;
&#13;
both sides. I made it very clear to Peter that I would not recommend&#13;
&#13;
lending until both sides in Laos agreed fully to it ..&#13;
&#13;
      There was a lot of pressure on the Bank in those days, you may&#13;
&#13;
recall,   to lend to South Vietnam also, and basically, at least for&#13;
&#13;
AID, lending to Laos was also seen as a similar operation:      11&#13;
                                                                     Congress&#13;
is cutting our funds, so the Bank should go and lend".       And there was&#13;
&#13;
a guy, an AID representative whose name I don't remember, who was&#13;
&#13;
really the CIA's man, I suppose, and he put it very crudely,           "What&#13;
&#13;
are you pussy-tooting around with getting numbers and all that?           Here,&#13;
&#13;
we have been giving X million.     Now we are giving X minus Y, so you&#13;
&#13;
must come and give Y."     Charlie Whitehouse, the Ambassador, was much&#13;
&#13;
more sophisticated and we remained in contact afterwards.       He just now&#13;
&#13;
was in the news because he mobilized this effort against Walt Disney. 2&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Uhuh.   Because he has a farm near--&#13;
&#13;
A:    That's right.     He was riding with Jackie Kennedy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now, so you went to Indonesia in '75 where you succeeded Dave&#13;
&#13;
Gordon?&#13;
&#13;
A:    That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    He had been there only for--&#13;
&#13;
A:    About three years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Three years?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Well, Bernie came back after the reorganization in July '72,&#13;
&#13;
give or take a little, and this was the summer of '75, so three years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now, the Indonesia mission in those days was still considered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     39&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 40&#13;
  something very special.        It had sort of--&#13;
&#13;
 A:          Yes.   It's magic all along that Don had. 38   Bernie Bell had&#13;
&#13;
  reported directly to God, and occasionally to McNamara.           David Gordon&#13;
&#13;
 had reported to whoever was there ...&#13;
&#13;
 Q:          Cargill was the--&#13;
&#13;
 A:          I guess Cargill to begin with, and then Bernie Bell after '74.&#13;
&#13;
 Gordon had a Director position.          I did not get any upgrade and we had&#13;
&#13;
 a big debate as to how it should be written up and, and in fact one&#13;
&#13;
 day in the organizational chart they left the Director title off.                  I&#13;
&#13;
 made it very clear that I was not looking for a promotion in going&#13;
&#13;
 out.        I would have loved it, but I knew this was not going to happen.&#13;
&#13;
 But then I also did not want the Indonesians to be told,           "Look,   this&#13;
&#13;
  is a downgraded position now."        And Bernie, of course, was perfectly&#13;
&#13;
 happy having me report only to him, for obvious reasons, because he&#13;
&#13;
 wanted to remain close to Indonesia. I don't know whether he would&#13;
&#13;
 have picked me to go out there, but I don't think he was particularly&#13;
&#13;
 unhappy; he could have stopped it if he had wanted to.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:          I would think that he might have been one of the people who had&#13;
&#13;
 pushed for you to go out there.&#13;
&#13;
 A:           He did not say that, and my understanding is that the decision&#13;
&#13;
 was made at the senior what-not committee level.           In those days&#13;
&#13;
 Cargill was still among the pretty important voices of the Bank.               I&#13;
&#13;
 had made it very clear I wanted to get some sort of mission,&#13;
&#13;
 preferably India, but Indonesia or something like that would be okay&#13;
&#13;
 also.        I don't think Bernie was unhappy.     I don 1 t know whether he&#13;
&#13;
  would have picked me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       I have decided to keep this sentence, undecipherably&#13;
        38&#13;
&#13;
meaningless though it is, to illustrate my difficulties with&#13;
the transcript. Or, perhaps, to illustrate the transcriber's&#13;
difficulties with my voice and pronunciation, or to illustrate&#13;
our joint difficulties with the tape-recorder.&#13;
&#13;
                                           40&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Baneth, Page 41&#13;
Q:    And the focus, of course, of the Indonesia mission in those days&#13;
&#13;
was very much the economic work and the economic--&#13;
&#13;
A:    No.   That was in fact very open.    When I went out, there was a&#13;
&#13;
lot of noise in Washington that the Indonesia office was "just a&#13;
&#13;
country-club"; they were indeed not working very hard.     The days, when&#13;
&#13;
Bernie Bell was working hand-in-hand with the Ministers, were over.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, many of the working habits stayed: you know, it&#13;
&#13;
was, sort of, people would come in around nine, go home for lunch at&#13;
twelve, come back at three, go home at five. On Saturdays, even though&#13;
&#13;
the Indonesians were working, the Bank office was completely closed.&#13;
I tightened working habits considerably and against some considerable&#13;
&#13;
local opposition.&#13;
&#13;
      There were no economists.     The only economist out there was&#13;
&#13;
Tommy Thompson.     He was one of the two Deputy Directors, the other&#13;
&#13;
being Shig Takahashi. And Bernie's opinion of Tommy Thompson was not&#13;
&#13;
high. I don't know who had written the previous economic report but I&#13;
&#13;
don't think it had been done out there. We had to do one. There was a&#13;
&#13;
lot of talk before my going out, what should be the role of the&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia Office, and there were very conflicting opinions. Obviously&#13;
&#13;
the hierarchy here in Washington opposed the mission having a&#13;
&#13;
substantial role, and it did not really fully see the facilitation&#13;
&#13;
role either. Bernie of course wanted the mission to have a big role,&#13;
&#13;
because he controlled the mission directly. The Indonesians at least&#13;
&#13;
wanted the close contacts with people out there, or that was my&#13;
&#13;
impression; but there was a lot of debate about it.     It had moved away&#13;
&#13;
from economic work, and I think it was understood that with me it&#13;
&#13;
would move back more, towards more economic work.     But I guess in&#13;
&#13;
retrospect one of the main mistakes I made was that I said that I did&#13;
&#13;
not really know what the role should be, because I was not out there,&#13;
&#13;
so maybe it should only be clarified later; and of course it was never&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     41&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Baneth, Page 42&#13;
  clarified, and it remained very controversial.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:          But still, the role of the Indonesia mission was always very&#13;
&#13;
  different from the role of the India mission.             Can you compare the&#13;
&#13;
  two,        since you are one of the few people who has been in both&#13;
&#13;
  missions, and its relationship with the government and--?&#13;
&#13;
  A:          Well, the Indonesia mission was set up before we had any lending&#13;
&#13;
  going, practically, and it was very much a facilitation mission, but&#13;
&#13;
  more facilitation to the Indonesians than facilitation to the World&#13;
&#13;
  Bank. Showing them,        "This is how you do these things 11   â&#128;¢   Nobody was&#13;
&#13;
  then telling the Indians        11&#13;
                                       that is how you do things", as you well&#13;
&#13;
  know.&#13;
              Secondly, there was a political relationship.        The Head of the&#13;
  mission was Bernie. When Bernie first went on a mission to Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
  for AID, they sent out a young graduate student just returned, to help&#13;
  him carry his suitcase or whatever, and that was Widjoyo; and that was&#13;
&#13;
  how their relationship developed".&#13;
              The Indonesian mission had a technical assistance fund which the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         39&#13;
        Widjoyo became, and long remained, the Head of the team&#13;
of Ministers dealing with economic issues, and a trusted&#13;
advisor to President Suharto.&#13;
      Another political dimension of Indonesia should be&#13;
mentioned. In the 1960s, when the United States was warring in&#13;
Vietnam to prevent the dominos from falling, Indonesia seemed&#13;
a big potential domino. The outlawing of the Communist Party&#13;
there, and Suharto's subsequent rise to power came at a time&#13;
when the US was still reinforcing its presence in Vietnam.&#13;
When McNamara first visited Indonesia, on his return to&#13;
Washington he went directly from the airport to the White&#13;
House, or so I have heard from a usually reliable source - I&#13;
cannot recall the date, but it must have been in late 1967 or&#13;
1968, when Johnson was still US President. All this to say&#13;
that the other "political dimension" was that this bulwark of&#13;
anti-communism, the developing world's third most populous&#13;
country, an oil producer to boot, astride a strategic sea-way,&#13;
must be preserved and nurtured. By 1975 this strategic&#13;
interest had faded: Nixon had made it up to China, and the US&#13;
had disengaged from Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
                                              42&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Baneth, Page 43&#13;
Mission Chief administered on his own, without any reference to&#13;
Washington.   He would say,   11&#13;
                                   Here is $500,000" or whatever.   It could&#13;
&#13;
be audited, but he did not have to refer it to anyone.         This does&#13;
develop some tender relations, because the people with whom one deals,&#13;
or their pet projects, are getting a benefit from it.&#13;
      Habits had been taken, which had outlived their usefulness but&#13;
&#13;
lingered on, with people going to see, without appointments, people in&#13;
the Ministries or in the Planning Office (BAPPENAS) . This was fine in&#13;
the days when there was one Bank mission every three months.         Well,&#13;
now there were 30 Bank missions every day, but they still tried to&#13;
keep up these habits.&#13;
      On the other hand, the Bank was not chairing the&#13;
Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) meeting, but it was&#13;
preparing the Secretariat documents. This was done much more&#13;
cooperatively with the Indonesians, at least in Bernie's days, than&#13;
had been the case in India.        The Indonesians did not like to be&#13;
criticized, and they had got used not to be, because Bernie never&#13;
would formulate any criticism, certainly not in public.&#13;
      The Delhi Office had long been a very small office, one and then&#13;
two men. Its role under Gilmartin changed a lot.         It got involved much&#13;
more in economic policy, as a continuation of the Bell mission; very&#13;
occasionally Gil himself would get into some project thing, but the&#13;
&#13;
rest of the Delhi Office, not much.&#13;
      The Indonesian mission was much more project and advice, but&#13;
&#13;
without report writing.    In Bernie's days the economic reports were&#13;
not written out there.    They were evolved there, but by people who&#13;
came from Headquarters.    So Bernie did not have to formulate any&#13;
criticism, and he could tame that of others. He had this direct&#13;
&#13;
relations with the Indonesians.&#13;
      on the other hand, the relationship, it was a bit symbiotic, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         43&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Baneth, Page 44&#13;
 it's difficult to say which part of it was the stronger. They really&#13;
&#13;
 did want advice, but then they'' also really appreciated that their&#13;
&#13;
 getting advice was giving them strength with the President, because&#13;
&#13;
 they could always say "it's the Bank, " and they also appreciated that&#13;
&#13;
 their     appearing to get advice strengthened the hands of the men who&#13;
&#13;
 were dealing with them from the Bank; and what the exact proportion of&#13;
&#13;
 roles in all that was/ I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
         The relationship was changing. The Bank had been, at the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning, the only source of money, directly and through the IGGI&#13;
&#13;
 meeting.         Then the Bank turned into a curmudgeon and said "You should&#13;
&#13;
 not be borrowing all that money." The biggest difficulty, the only&#13;
&#13;
 thing which I personally kept writing, even in economic reports&#13;
&#13;
 written mostly be Headquarters Staff, was the last paragraph, as I&#13;
&#13;
 recall.         Something like "Indonesia's creditworthiness is consistent&#13;
&#13;
 with its borrowing not more than so much 11              -   a specific figure. And&#13;
&#13;
 that figure was really negotiated with Widjoyo over a long period.&#13;
&#13;
 And they both resented and appreciated it, because they could go to&#13;
&#13;
 the President, who, of course had to be occasionally restrained, and&#13;
&#13;
 say "The Bank opposes this". But at the same time, it meant the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 was telling some other departments that they could not do what they&#13;
&#13;
 wanted.    11   0h 1   "   they said,   "money is no problem", and you said,   "Yes, it&#13;
&#13;
 is a problem because even if you borrow one day you have to repay it."&#13;
&#13;
 That changed the relationship. The Bank was no longer mostly allowing&#13;
&#13;
 them to do things they knew they could not do without the Bank; the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank was preventing them from doing things which,                  in the short run,&#13;
&#13;
 they could have done, except for the Bank's opposition.&#13;
&#13;
         The relationship was changed. There was much more to be done.&#13;
&#13;
 In the early days we would do one project every six months; now we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    40&#13;
       The economic Ministers, also often called the&#13;
"technocrats", and sometimes the "Berkeley Mafia".&#13;
&#13;
                                                  44&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 45&#13;
  were doing 16 projects every month, and the Bank was just one part of&#13;
&#13;
  it.        Not all Bank missions appreciated that one of the big problems I&#13;
&#13;
  had there was that        everybody wanted to see Ministers, and Ministers&#13;
&#13;
  did not want to be seen by everyone any longer.&#13;
&#13;
              I was responsible for making sure that, when somebody really&#13;
  needed to see a Minister, he would get an appointment. So I said,&#13;
&#13;
  "Okay, but then I decide 11 --obviously it was the Minister who would&#13;
&#13;
  ultimately decide-- "who should get access".           And this was terribly&#13;
&#13;
  resented.        Kearns 41 thought it was bad, and so on.   Russ Cheetham42 ,&#13;
&#13;
  of course, reinstated it as soon as he went out and realized how the&#13;
&#13;
  wind was blowing.&#13;
              The same problem with meetings arose at lower levels too. The&#13;
&#13;
 Agriculture Division Chief in the Plan Organization had even built&#13;
&#13;
  himself a little hidden office.         He did not sit in his own office,&#13;
  because Bank people had taken to dropping in without appointments, he&#13;
  could not do any work, and this was driving him crazy.           This dropping&#13;
&#13;
  in was wonderful when you had one Bank mission every three months, and&#13;
&#13;
  they could say "I haven't seen you for a long time, how are you, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        41&#13;
       Director of the Organizational Department; he and Mike&#13;
Ruddy, then East Asia Program Coordinator, were asked by&#13;
Shahid Husain, who replaced Bernie Bell as VP, to study the&#13;
organization of the Jakarta Office and its relationships with&#13;
Headquarters. They came out several times, wondered around&#13;
asking Indonesians how they liked the Resident Staff in&#13;
general, and in particular its Director, and ended up with a&#13;
totally unworkable new organizational relationship. In all&#13;
fairness to them, though, I have heard that they actually made&#13;
quite a different recommendation first, and that was&#13;
overturned by Husain.&#13;
        42 My&#13;
         successor once removed. My immediate successor was&#13;
Stanley Please, who asked to return to Headquarters after a&#13;
few months. During that time, he never got a single&#13;
appointment from the governor of the Central Bank, who also&#13;
was Governor of the World bank for Indonesia and one of our&#13;
main contacts.&#13;
                                           45&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Baneth, Page 46&#13;
  so on."    When you had 16 missions looking at 16 different agricultural&#13;
&#13;
  projects in a single a week (which actually happened once), this poor&#13;
&#13;
  guy could not do any work, so he would use this small hidden office.&#13;
&#13;
  But it was a source of tension with Headquarters, because I had to&#13;
&#13;
  take this stand, that everyone could not visit the top Indonesian man&#13;
&#13;
  any more. I myself could get through any time I wanted to, but that&#13;
&#13;
 meant that I could not allow everybody to go at any time.&#13;
&#13;
          Actually, even I could not always get through. I once had a hell&#13;
&#13;
  of a problem with a "Press Tour" Bernie had organized, or rather had&#13;
&#13;
 been asked to organize. This was just before the Annual Meeting in&#13;
&#13;
 Manila, and somebody suggested a press tour of Indonesia, so Bernie&#13;
&#13;
  said he would ask the Indonesians.        I was there when he asked; and&#13;
&#13;
  even Bernie could slip up. He said,       11&#13;
                                                 We have been thinking of this&#13;
&#13;
  press tour, do you have an objection?" and they said,           11&#13;
                                                                       hmrn hmrn 11   â&#128;¢   But&#13;
&#13;
  the time carne near for the press tour,          I could not get them a single&#13;
&#13;
 meeting, not a single project visit, from any of the Economic&#13;
&#13;
 Ministers, nothing, absolute blank.             And finally I had to go to the&#13;
&#13;
 Head of Military Intelligence, and then we did a deal that two&#13;
&#13;
  Indonesian newspapermen, what the Canard enchaine calls newspapermen&#13;
&#13;
  (sic), newspapermen between    quotation marks, would join the tour.&#13;
&#13;
 They were perfectly accredited, to the Army newspaper and the Party&#13;
&#13;
 newspaper or something.     And once that was agreed, suddenly everything&#13;
&#13;
  fell into place and there were meetings and everything.&#13;
&#13;
          This was about the last week before the visit. I had become&#13;
&#13;
 absolutely desperate. What would I do with these newspapermen? so I&#13;
&#13;
  asked Fred Nossal 43 if he could call it off, and he said,              11&#13;
                                                                               no,   that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     43&#13;
        I loved Fred, an absolutely charming and, in my view,&#13;
effective public relations man. He had been a journalist with&#13;
some British or Australian paper, posted, I seem to remember,&#13;
in Peking before he came to the Bank A few years later, during&#13;
the Annual Meeting in Dubrovnik, he committed suicide by&#13;
&#13;
                                       46&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Baneth, Page 47&#13;
  would be terrible"i     so then I decided to put my links with the&#13;
&#13;
  economic guys on the guillotine, because I went, not exactly above&#13;
&#13;
  their heads, but certainly to a side show.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:    And they directed you to the Intelligence?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     No.     They did not.   I went to the Intelligence on my own.&#13;
&#13;
  Nobody directed.     Nobody would talk to me about this. I knew the&#13;
&#13;
  Intelligence guy because I had mascaraded as a cousin at his&#13;
&#13;
 daughter's, or at his son's, marriage. Some Indonesian friends had&#13;
&#13;
  invited me. This was a very particular marriage and I was there only&#13;
&#13;
  to see it. I was chatting - now I recall, the marriage was his son's,&#13;
&#13;
 because this was a Minang Kabau marriage, and I was chatting with this&#13;
&#13;
 man who was also completely left out of everything,       this Indonesian&#13;
&#13;
 man, we were talking, and finally he turned out to be the girl's&#13;
&#13;
  father.     But as this was a Minang Kabau   marriage, and that is a&#13;
&#13;
 matriarchal society, he was also on the fringes, like I was.        Anyway,&#13;
&#13;
 that's by the way.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     Did Bernie interfere a lot while you were there?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     No.    With Bernie, he interfered some but basically we were&#13;
&#13;
 fairly well on the same wave length.       There was one economic report.&#13;
&#13;
 The first one I wrote was a sort of interim report,      it was basically&#13;
&#13;
 the end of the Pertamina crisis, and there was no big problem.          Then&#13;
&#13;
 in a second report we looked at investment plans and all that and&#13;
&#13;
 found that they were really overextending, and they had to be careful&#13;
&#13;
 not to over-borrow.      And the Indonesians were extraordinarily&#13;
&#13;
 cooperative while I did all the research, and they said,      "This is very&#13;
&#13;
  interesting."    And they added up the figures.    But then we ran into a&#13;
&#13;
 real difficulty. I had left to discuss the report here in Washington,&#13;
&#13;
 and there were problems there.      And Bernie was basically quite helpful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
jumping out of a window.&#13;
&#13;
                                       47&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth, Page 48&#13;
on that.&#13;
        He interfered on transmigration, according to the transmigration&#13;
people, but not immoderately.    But he was already close to retirement,&#13;
and this was his last year.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Transmigration started, and our involvement in transmigration&#13;
started when you were--&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   It had, was it the first project, second project?   It had&#13;
started before I went out.    Certainly the discussions were going on.&#13;
What sort of project it should be, how much it would take, how lavish&#13;
it should be, whether it can be tree crops or food crops ... By and&#13;
large, the Indonesians wanted a simpler, more replicable investment,&#13;
and the Bank went in for the more--&#13;
Q:      Had this already become sort of a matter of some controversy&#13;
when you were there?&#13;
A:      Oh, yes.   It was more so afterwards, but certainly it had&#13;
&#13;
started being controversial around these lines.     Then the upswing came&#13;
under Shahid Husain, and Shahid at some point spoke about one billion&#13;
dollars for transmigration, and he hired Bob Sadove to lead a team. He&#13;
&#13;
was really gung-ho and "let's get on with it", and they were in&#13;
cahoots, I don't mean an immoral sense but they basically were on the&#13;
side of the rapid expansion of Bank lending for this.&#13;
        There were several ministers involved. One of them was&#13;
Poernomasidi, who was Minister of Public Works. He was basically&#13;
thinking in terms of using a billion dollars, which the Bank would&#13;
give him, to buy machinery to cut down the trees, and then plant&#13;
cassava. This is caricaturing, obviously, a little, but not all that&#13;
much.    Plunk down the transmigrants and they will then cultivate the&#13;
land and grow cassavas and live happily ever after.&#13;
        You had the involvement of the plantations, and you had the&#13;
involvement of Martone, who was the Junior Minister for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     48&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth, Page 49&#13;
transmigration. He had replaced Subroto, and he was a peasant and he&#13;
was much more prudent then the rest.&#13;
&#13;
      Basically, the Jakarta Office was a bit in the middle.       We did&#13;
not think it was necessary to have only the very expensive, very&#13;
carefully done projects, because while you were doing those, other&#13;
people were transmigrating anyway, and you did not need lavish&#13;
conditions to be better, a hell of a lot better off, than you had been&#13;
as a landless peasant in Java.     On the other hand, you could not just&#13;
plunk them down and cut down the trees and farm on, as Poernomasidi's&#13;
projects seemed to require.&#13;
      But otherwise he was extremely impressive, he spoke German,&#13;
Dutch, whatever; he could write in mirror language, directly in five&#13;
languages.     When McNamara came out, he had all the graphs and&#13;
everything/ and McNamara was terribly impressed, while he thought&#13;
Martone was not good at all. And, of course, Martone merely did not&#13;
speak very good English, but he knew the people.     Anyway.   That's a&#13;
&#13;
parenthesis.&#13;
      Yes, there was a big controversy.     There was the Sadove team,&#13;
basically speaking, pushing, for this very large scale, program-type&#13;
approach; the traditionalists in the Agriculture Department being very&#13;
prudent; and us being crushed on both sides.     And at some point there&#13;
was a flare-up, and leaks to the newspapers. I guess before (or after)&#13;
that Sadove was suddenly taken off his mission, and then the Bank&#13;
became very much more prudent.&#13;
      But the controversy had started well under Bernie Bell, it was&#13;
Bernie asking why did one need that much money for transmigrants, and&#13;
less should do it.     Perhaps naively, I thought he was right.    I was&#13;
very new to this and probably I should not have taken sides, but you&#13;
know me. Incidentally, I just went to Indonesia again two years ago,&#13;
and I went out to Sumatra, to some god-forsaken areas.     My Indonesian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     49&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Baneth, Page 50&#13;
is still pretty good, and I spoke to the people directly. I still&#13;
&#13;
maintain that, though      obviously theirs is not a lavish life, though&#13;
&#13;
there are all sorts of problems, they feel so happy to have that land,&#13;
&#13;
so proud of having their own land and doing what they want with it!&#13;
&#13;
But where I think you have the big failures,       it is with the groups who&#13;
&#13;
did not want to go. It is the groups like that from the Dieng Plateau.&#13;
&#13;
In the Dieng Plateau you have these noxious gases coming up every now&#13;
&#13;
and then; it is wonderful land, except that every 20 years or whatever&#13;
&#13;
one has one of these eruptions, and a few hundred people die.         And&#13;
&#13;
when that happens, the Government will again start enforcing exclusion&#13;
&#13;
zones; and all the people who have encroached are shipped to Sumatra&#13;
&#13;
or some other island. And those people are terribly unhappy.&#13;
&#13;
      The volunteers, by and large, are all right, and those of them&#13;
&#13;
who had some money back home, they are really prospering, because then&#13;
&#13;
they can invest, they have their own ---&#13;
&#13;
Q:    But would the conditions also differ in different locations?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Of course.      There are those locational gaps.    You have the&#13;
&#13;
locational differences because of the location of the transmigration&#13;
&#13;
site, more or less well suited, and you have the preparation&#13;
&#13;
differences.      I certainly have not been everywhere/ and there are some&#13;
&#13;
pretty dismal failures, but then there are some pretty dismal failures&#13;
&#13;
in Java,   too.&#13;
&#13;
      I have in my office 1 I guess I have it in my home in France now,&#13;
&#13;
a big sharp bamboo. One day, it was delivered into the office in&#13;
&#13;
Jakarta by a nicely dressed gentleman with a polite letter, which said&#13;
&#13;
in Indonesian something like,     "You do this reforestation project 11 - -&#13;
&#13;
which we actually had not done in the end, but we were appraising it,&#13;
&#13;
and it was a matter of reforestation of some slopes, but of course the&#13;
&#13;
first thing you have to do then is to get the people to get off&#13;
&#13;
because,    why is there need for reforestation?      Because they have cut&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      50&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Baneth, Page 51&#13;
all the wood.    The note said: "You have this reforestation project,&#13;
but we don't like it.    Please find here as a souvenir a sharpened&#13;
bamboo.   We sincerely hope that we shall not have to drive it through&#13;
your stomach.    Respectfully yours, The Inhabitants of Solo."&#13;
      Now, Java was difficult also.      These people were climbing up the&#13;
mountain because there was nothing else to do, really, they were&#13;
cutting down the wood because that is something to sell, and then they&#13;
were planting cassava, so the mountain was coming down.&#13;
Q:    Bernie left in '76, I suppose, or--&#13;
A:    I think it was early '77, like January or thereabouts.&#13;
Q:    In '77, and then Shahid took over while you were out there in--?&#13;
A:    Oh, yes.                                                                                 ~&#13;
                                                                                ~J&#13;
Q:    And did that change your life?                                         ern&#13;
A:    Well, Shahid first turned his mind                                     e~&#13;
so I was fairly sheltered then.    Then it came time to replace              ~~&#13;
                                                                             !'I}Cl&#13;

                                                                                                fr&#13;
replacing him.   I guess I wanted to replace him with a senior                                  ~&#13;
                                                                                                ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
economist, and my bad luck was to hit on Jasperson. I said bad luck&#13;
because he took about two years to decide that, after all, he did not&#13;
want to come out, and he said, "I'm terribly sorry."&#13;
Q:    Well, then you picked this guy who--&#13;
A:    I didn't pick Bharrier. Greg Votaw had proposed him, and I said,&#13;
"Okay, maybe, but have him interviewed by Parvez Hasan"; but in fact,&#13;
they recruited him before interview.     Okay.   Then I talked to him.   I&#13;
was certainly not enchanted, but not disenchanted enough to overrule&#13;
what had been already told him.   And then he came out and he started&#13;
looking for a palace. That again is something on which I just&#13;
refreshed my memory, looking at letters.     We had a rent ceiling and&#13;
various people had found houses. Takahachi was also going and told him&#13;
"why not take my house?" and he said,    "but it's an awful house."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    51&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Baneth, Page 52&#13;
Takahachi said, "Look, I lived here five years, and it was a very&#13;
pleasant house, and I had two kids."        And then Bharrier said: "Well,&#13;
it you put up with that, you are a tool, but I will not be!", and so&#13;
on.     And then I said we would not go above the rent ceiling, for which&#13;
perfectly good houses were available, but he could pay for the&#13;
supplement, or the Bank would share half the supplement, I think that&#13;
was the way it went.       And then his wife came and did a sit-down strike&#13;
in my office.       Part of the problem was that I had said at the&#13;
beginning, "This is it, and I don't want to go over it", and then&#13;
Washington started to say, "Aah, but shipping him back would be even&#13;
more costly!".      He would have taken it if it had been firm, but there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        -&#13;
were these noises from Washington, and, anyway, in the end he went&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        ---&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             JI&#13;
&#13;
          Then with Bottelier, again I had no luck                            Qrn&#13;

                                                                              5~&#13;

him how terrible Indonesia was, and of course the Journal then spread&#13;
it all out, quoting John Malone and then John Malone decided he did&#13;
not like Indonesia after all and he wanted to come back, so he came&#13;

back after a while, and in retrospect I think that perhaps Shahid&#13;
&#13;
wanted John Malone to replace me first, but I don't really know that.&#13;
&#13;
           Then Shahid proposed Ping Loh, and I told Shahid "maybe, but let&#13;
&#13;
me ask around, because being Chinese is a bit of a problem".                               So I&#13;
&#13;
asked around, I massaged people, and he came out. Then I heard people&#13;
&#13;
say that Shahid wanted Ping Loh to be my successor, and I was stupid&#13;
&#13;
enough to say to Ping that people say that.              11&#13;
                                                              0h,   11&#13;

                                                                                          no.&#13;
&#13;
That's not my ambition".       I said,    "Look, if it were I would recommend&#13;
&#13;
against it. Not because of you personally, but I think politically it&#13;
&#13;
would not be good for the Bank.          It is not good to have a deputy&#13;
&#13;
promoted to first man in the field,             and it is not good to have a&#13;
&#13;
Chinese representing the Bank here.        rr    And after that Ping became&#13;
&#13;
slightly" hostile.&#13;
&#13;
           And then Shahid talked to the Indonesians directly.                      Thanks God,&#13;
&#13;
he did not tell me to try to get it through.              Apparently,           (so I was&#13;
&#13;
told by either Stern or Peter Cargill, I don't remember who told me -&#13;
&#13;
no,   it could not have been Peter so it must have been Ernie) that&#13;
&#13;
Shahid asked Bernie to clear it with the Indonesians.                        I don't know&#13;
&#13;
what happened.       Bernie told him to go ahead, and Shahid talked to Ali&#13;
&#13;
wardhana, the Finance Minister, here in Washington, and then told me,&#13;
&#13;
when a little later I too came here. And Ali Wardhana said something,&#13;
&#13;
you know 1 in the Indonesian way,        "well, of course we love him, but we&#13;
&#13;
will have to ask".       And they kept answering that, for about nine&#13;
&#13;
months, or whatever.       And then, when McNamara came out to Indonesia,&#13;
&#13;
they told him that no, you know, they loved him, but politically it&#13;
&#13;
would be difficult.       As I said, thank God I had nothing to do with&#13;
&#13;
that.       I was not asked, I was in fact asked not to deal with it; it&#13;
&#13;
would have been very difficult for me otherwise.&#13;

          There was also a personal problem because Ping, and also Richard&#13;
&#13;
 Stern, the Division Chief, had antagonized Saleh Affif 46 something&#13;
&#13;
 dreadful. They thought he was just a second-rank bureaucrat.          Well, he&#13;
&#13;
 was not, even then, and now you know he is the super-minister&#13;
&#13;
 overseeing all other economic Ministers. That, however, was not a main&#13;
&#13;
 thing.     I think it was really the political issue, and the President.&#13;
&#13;
 I guess the President felt that he had enough trouble with his Chinese&#13;
&#13;
 without including the World Bank's Chinese.&#13;
&#13;
          Five years ago, I was still Department Director, we had Tom&#13;
&#13;
 Klein dealing with debt seminars 1 and somebody called me saying we&#13;
&#13;
 should really not send him to a seminar organized by the Islamic&#13;
&#13;
 Development Bank.     I was surprised, and asked: "why not, what is&#13;
&#13;
 wrong?"     "He is a Jew.   11&#13;
                                  And I got really very upset about that, and&#13;
&#13;
 we had a long argument.          In the end Tom Klein went, and everything&#13;
&#13;
 went fine.     But it made me think about these things. I don't know&#13;
&#13;
 whether it is right to consider these things. I was quite clear,&#13;
&#13;
 before and after the fact, that it was wrong to consider Torn Klein's&#13;
&#13;
 religion. But then, in hindsight, was I right to think that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should have considered Ping Loh's ethnic background, and not sought to&#13;
&#13;
 foist him on the Inonesians? I have given this a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
 thought, since then. I think there is a difference. I thought it was&#13;
&#13;
 perfectly all right for Ping Loh to come as a staff member; I&#13;
&#13;
 certainly would have resented it if they had opposed him as a staff&#13;
&#13;
 member. Deputy is intermediate, so I thought I'd prepare it, and get&#13;
&#13;
 it through the Indonesians. But Head of Mission is different.&#13;

 A:       --Because there was this general feeling in the populace that&#13;
&#13;
 the Chinese were behind certain reforms that the Bank wanted to push,&#13;

market reforms. I felt it would make it difficult for us and for the&#13;
Indonesians if such reforms were pushed by somebody who was so easily&#13;
identifiable with the local Chinese.      But frankly, I have some doubt&#13;
whether they would have refused him if the Bank had asked me to deal&#13;
with it, and if I had personally insisted on it. As I said, I had&#13;
nothing to do with it. I would have advised against it, but my advice&#13;
was not asked, nor my intervention, so I never really got into that&#13;
position.   Shahid never asked me.   But he was directly involved,&#13;
directly rebuffed (or rather indirectly, as the Indonesians finally&#13;
spoke directly to McNamara), and then Shahid was pretty upset with me.&#13;
      As everything leaks in the Bank, somebody leaked to me a&#13;
memorandum he had sent to McNamara saying that I was a bad manager;&#13;
"the Indonesians respect him but he is a bad manager".     Then the&#13;
Indonesians, before even they said no to Ping Loh, kept asking shahid,&#13;
"BUt why can't Baneth stay?"   I once had a real run-in with one of the&#13;
Ministers before that.   As I saÂ·id, the RSI Director was alone&#13;
responsible for assigning these Technical Assistance grants, and I&#13;
guess they had got into bad habits about that.&#13;

a very Javanese way, whom did the Indonesian Government delegate to&#13;
ask McNamara and Shahid Husain to leave me there?       It was actually&#13;
sumarlin himself who explained this to me later; it was he, Sumarlin,&#13;
who had to ask. But they [McNamara and Shahid] said no.      By that time,&#13;
Shahid did not want me there, so I came back to what turned out to be&#13;
a temporary position.&#13;
Q:      Yes.   I mean, you were not at the--&#13;
A:      And the Indonesians were pretty upset, which is what made it&#13;
real difficult Stanley Please there.&#13;
Q:      He succeeded you?&#13;
A:      He succeeded me, and he could not get a single appointment with&#13;
the Governor of the Central Bank, who was also Governor for the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Q:      Was there one reason why he had this problem?&#13;
A:      Yes.   That's what I was told by people who were out there.    Yes.&#13;
And it was pretty terrible.     If you go out, and there is a mandate to&#13;
do much better than Baneth, and to have a "policy dialogue" - because&#13;
that was a big item, to have a policy dialogue - and then you cannot&#13;
even get to see the guy ...&#13;

 A:        Pressure was pretty big.                        I had pretty good relations.      I really&#13;
  did.     Not like Bernie, but certainly better than Dave Gordon.                            But&#13;
&#13;
  even then, as when there were these newspapermen, sometimes I just&#13;
&#13;
  could not see people, because the Javanese do not like to say "No", so&#13;
&#13;
  the best way of not saying                      11&#13;
                                                       No" was not to see the person to whom you&#13;
&#13;
 might have to say                  11&#13;
                                         No" ..&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Now/ you came back and when you went out there your plan had&#13;
&#13;
 been to kind of use this as a way to shift to manager--&#13;
                                                           47&#13;
 A:        Yes.        I had, when Manfred                      died, with great embarrassment, but&#13;
&#13;
  I nevertheless did go and see David Hopper, and I said I would very&#13;
&#13;
 much like to get that position.                            And actually at that visit,     I also&#13;
                           48&#13;
 went to see Reg                ;   this was in September of 1978, I went to Reg&#13;
&#13;
 Clarke and he asked how were things going. I said that there had been&#13;
&#13;
  some misunderstandings, but now Husain seemed to appreciate me. He&#13;
&#13;
 said,     11&#13;
                Well, let me tell you that he said to me that you are a bad&#13;
&#13;
 manager 11      ,   or words to that effect.                     Then I asked "Can I quote this to&#13;
&#13;
  him?"         I wanted to do that, because Shahid was still telling me that I&#13;
&#13;
  should only come back for a program directorship.                               nNo", he said,    "No,&#13;
  you better not. "&#13;
&#13;
           But then, that's when also I went to see David Hopper, and then&#13;
&#13;
  some months later he said No, he had been advised not to pick me.                                 And&#13;
&#13;
  then sometime after that I had a real blowout with Shahid, because&#13;
&#13;
  there was a lot of talk about East Africa Mafia in those days in&#13;
&#13;
  Indonesia, for obvious reasons. It was a question of choosing someone&#13;
&#13;
  for loan officer. He favored one person, also from his old East Africa&#13;
&#13;
  crew.         I said,   "Look, we really have to have explain."                      (By that time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

      47 Manfred&#13;

  I knew that I wasn't getting a directorship.       He was recommending&#13;
  somebody, actually Jim Adams-)-&#13;
  Q:        Uhuh.&#13;
  A:        --and I said, "Fine.   But let us explain, why it is we think it&#13;
  should be he, because people do speak of the East Africa Mafia, and so&#13;
  on". He then blew his top, saying, "You are the Director, so you have&#13;
                                                                                              j&#13;
  to make the choice . "    So I                                            I                       I&#13;

  disagreement. Then we had a dinner with Ping Loh and Richard Stern,&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                  Jj&#13;
  which was when Shahid attacked me. I did not like that very much, I&#13;
  really felt that at that point I had lost, and I was not expecting any&#13;
  support from him.      As long as I only knew that he had criticized me to&#13;
  Reg Clarke, I swallowed it.      When he told me I was not getting a&#13;
  directorship, I did not ask him "why do you do that",Â·      I was taking it&#13;
  in stride, but a public attack I disliked50 â&#128;¢     A bit later he said&#13;
  there was this wonderful position in Finance, and that was where I&#13;
  would be coming. I had never been very good at looking for positions,&#13;
  so I took that.&#13;
  Q:        That was in fact what Peter, he or--&#13;
  A:        Peter and, it's PMB, the Policy something, Financial Policy,&#13;
  orobowitz( 51 ?) was on sabbatical and there was a place for me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Kirmani was Project Director under Husain -he had been&#13;
       49&#13;
&#13;
brought in by Bernie.&#13;
        That sounds very restrained, for me. I actually felt&#13;
       50&#13;
&#13;
that attacking a manager in front of his subordinate was not&#13;
only unpleasant, it was also bad management.&#13;
       51&#13;
            Is this really my pronunciation? The name is Joe Wood.&#13;
                                        58&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          Baneth, Page 59&#13;
  Q:        Uhuh.        And that had to do with financial planning--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        We had to do a number of policy papers. The biggest one was&#13;
&#13;
  something about financial flows to developing countries, and I had big&#13;
&#13;
  questions about that, but I was explained that everybody was talking&#13;
&#13;
  in terms of       11&#13;
                         how will we get all the money from commercial banks" and&#13;
                                 52&#13;
  so on.      Rod Berger(?)           was thinking about his Bank's Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
  McNamara was giving directions, and I wrote a memo to George Gabriel&#13;
&#13;
  saying,     "Look, i t seems to me there are two ways, two possibilities.&#13;
&#13;
  I would"--&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Who was then, so to speak, your boss, Gabriel.&#13;
&#13;
 A:         Yes.    Although he was very hands-off, and Qureshi was much&#13;
&#13;
  involved, and McNamara too, for that matter, in that paper.                          In those&#13;
&#13;
  days I was going to Financial Policy Committee and all that sort of&#13;
&#13;
  thing.      Anyway, I wrote this memo to Gabriel and I asked him to pass&#13;
&#13;
  it on to McNamara and so on. The memo said that either developing&#13;
  countries need this money and can borrow it, and there is the money&#13;
&#13;
  out there, but somehow there is a market failure and we are looking&#13;
&#13;
  for intermediationi or, in fact, developing countries are not&#13;
&#13;
  creditworthy for more borrowing, in which case we need something very&#13;
&#13;
 different.         And, wrote I,       11&#13;
                                             I   think it is the second case 11   â&#128;¢   And the&#13;
&#13;
 answer was, scribbled on this memorandum, that "this is not the&#13;
&#13;
  question which is being asked".&#13;
&#13;
            So we had big trouble writing this paper. That was partly also&#13;
&#13;
  due to disagreement with the projections Russ Cheetham was making 53 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
  Isenman, who was team leader for WDR, was also unhappy with the&#13;
&#13;
  projections which he thought terribly rosy.                     They were based on a one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       52 Actually,&#13;
                            Gene Rothberg, the Bank's Treasurer.&#13;
       53&#13;
       This is completely garbled. I just substitute what I&#13;
want to say, without much regard for the next few written&#13;
sentences.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      59&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Baneth, Page 60&#13;
  percent real interest rate forever and after, so capital flows could&#13;
&#13;
  just keep on increasing. I said one percent makes no sense. I wanted&#13;
&#13;
  to make it three percent minimum. Then, of course, you had a very&#13;
&#13;
  different picture.     And we never reconciled that part of it.             We&#13;
&#13;
  always remained with our projections, and WDR with theirs. I wrote a&#13;
&#13;
  memo to McNamara,     noting that we had an   rr   Inflation Committee 11   ,    but we&#13;
&#13;
  never discussed interest rates, so why not transform it into a&#13;
&#13;
  "Planning Assumptions Commi ttee 11 and discuss both interest rates and&#13;
&#13;
  inflation rates.     He said "agreed."    But somehow for this one, it was&#13;
&#13;
  too late or it was never agreed, so we went differently, our&#13;
&#13;
  projections and WDR. And I tried to show all the time that there was&#13;
&#13;
  this problem, but it did not get resolved. I think what McNamara&#13;
&#13;
  wanted was a recipe to get more money.       You recall, this was at about&#13;
&#13;
  the time when he proposed his gearing reform -           the Brandt Commission,&#13;
&#13;
  so-called proposed it formally, but it was really his brilliant idea.&#13;
&#13;
  The gearing ratio could be changed54 , and then we could borrow much&#13;
&#13;
  more money on commercial terms. I wrote a small article in an obscure&#13;
&#13;
  publication that spoke about these figure links 55 and defaults&#13;
&#13;
  multiplying in the 1980s, although I must say that I did not see the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     54&#13;
        The Bank is forbidden to lend more than its total&#13;
subscribed capital - a gearing ratio of one. McNamara's idea&#13;
was that, if commercial banks can borrow and lend up to 20&#13;
times their total equity, the World Bank should be able to&#13;
lend at least twice its equity, or subscribed capital, a&#13;
gearing ratio of two. For various reasons, that is a&#13;
completely cock-eyed idea, particularly in the circumstances&#13;
of 1980. That did not prevent it from being enthusiastically&#13;
endorsed by Mahbub ul Haq, and also, or at least not&#13;
criticized, by all members of the Fiance Committee. The only&#13;
demurral came from Gene Rothberg, who thought that though it&#13;
would not directly weaken the Bank, it might send the wrong&#13;
signal to bondholders. Instead, he favored the Bank's bank".&#13;
     55&#13;
       This one, at least, I can figure out: "figure links"&#13;
stands for "reschedulings". I am getting very worried as to&#13;
how my students record my lectures.&#13;
&#13;
                                       60&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 61&#13;
  whole extent of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
                    So we did a projection with three percent real interest&#13;
&#13;
  rate,    and a lot of the implications showed up. chenery called in some&#13;
&#13;
 arbitrators, and I cannot remember which professors came.            Helen&#13;
&#13;
  organized it, you know, a confrontation between Helen Hughes 56 and me&#13;
&#13;
  on this,    to decide what was the proper interest rate?        My guess is the&#13;
&#13;
 arbitrators said,        three percent is not unprecedented in history.      But&#13;
&#13;
 Helen remained with one percent.&#13;
&#13;
           The following year, I was already with Helen, that was therefore&#13;
&#13;
  1980, McNamara's last WDR, and McNamara personally approved all the&#13;
&#13;
 main assumptions. I convinced Helen to go to McNamara with a four&#13;
 percent real interest rate proposal.          Now,   I was not at the meeting,&#13;
&#13;
  so how strongly she defended it,       I do not know, but she came back&#13;
&#13;
  saying McNamara overruled four percent and said two percent.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Why did you then go from three to four?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Well, by that time it was 17 percent real--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Yes.     Nominal.&#13;
&#13;
 A:        You could see that this was a long-term project--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Right.     Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
 A:        In early 1980 you could say, well, of course there is a high&#13;
&#13;
  rate now, but it will come down,       and inflation was high, you did not&#13;
&#13;
 know how things were going.        Three percent seemed to be a minimum on&#13;
&#13;
  historical grounds, because it had always been sort of three or four&#13;
&#13;
 percent. By late 1980 it seemed likelier that the period of&#13;
&#13;
  unanticipated inflation was at last over.&#13;
&#13;
           Now I have a big argument with Ernie, funnily enough, with the&#13;
&#13;
  roles reversed; I say three or four percent are what the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
  be using as its discount rate.       He says, no,    it is much higher; ten&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      56&#13;
       Russ Cheetham was Deputy Director of EPD; she was&#13;
Director.&#13;
&#13;
                                          61&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Baneth, Page 62&#13;
  percent is what the Bank is using in project evaluation.                  And there&#13;
&#13;
  was this big inconsistency.             They were saying it is one percent&#13;
&#13;
  interest rate, but the marginal productivity, the lowest rate of&#13;
&#13;
  return to invested capital is 10 percent. If that were so, of course&#13;
&#13;
  you could not borrow too much.&#13;
             57&#13;
                  We were under great pressure to produce. We had that paper;&#13;
&#13;
  we had the Brandt Commission - it came out with nine, whatever&#13;
&#13;
  recommendations, we had to get papers out for each one of them; we had&#13;
&#13;
  a big paper on co-financing.             Gad!, we had then all the China issues,&#13;
&#13;
 and the capital increase projections.              It was just a paper factory,        it&#13;
&#13;
 was churning out, and not enough thought was given.               Every discussion&#13;
&#13;
  was focused on        11&#13;
                             what do we put in the paper?"    It was very&#13;
&#13;
 disappointing.              No discussion of substance, of the reality. What is&#13;
&#13;
  the reality of the debt issue, for instance?               It was all the papers.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Was that McNarnara's--&#13;
&#13;
 A:         It was everybody.         Much later (this is a parenthesis) I sent&#13;
&#13;
  Krueger a couple of memos on the financial profits of the Bank.                  I&#13;
&#13;
  said,     "Look, all these profits are only coming because they are taking&#13;
&#13;
  currency positions."             And, bless her, she did take it up in the&#13;
&#13;
 Managing Committee or some such thing, and it was thrown out.                  This is&#13;
&#13;
  when I decided for the first time, that if I really believed this,&#13;
&#13;
  then I had to take a currency position myself.              So I borrowed dollars&#13;
&#13;
  and bought Deutschemarks in 1985, by refinancing the mortgage on my&#13;
&#13;
  house.      The reason I can now retire with a quiet financial heart is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       57&#13;
        The text says" Security, that's what the problem I had&#13;
when I was Jim Adams' boss, I will say that.". I never was Jim&#13;
Adams's boss, and I cannot fit in this sentence, quite remote,&#13;
I am pretty sure, from whatever I wanted to say.&#13;
&#13;
                                               62&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Baneth, Page 63&#13;
  that ever since I have believed what I was saying 58 â&#128;¢        (End of&#13;
  parenthesis) .&#13;
&#13;
           There was no real discussion.        I don't know why,    certainly&#13;
&#13;
  because of McNamara partly, but it is also a more general                11&#13;
                                                                                Yes, Sir,&#13;
  how right you are, what is it that you are saying?" attitude.&#13;
&#13;
  Fundamentally, the Bank's thinking processes were organized there on&#13;
 papers, papers were the final product, of which everyone was always&#13;
  keenly aware, of course, and therefore the discussion was not really&#13;
  "what should we think of reality, what is reality?" but            11&#13;
                                                                          what should&#13;
&#13;
  be in the paper?"     If I were to tell you that I foresaw the debt&#13;
&#13;
  crisis I would be a big liar.        On the other hand, I did write, and I&#13;
 did make papers and I went to Yale, I remember, Alexandra Diaz&#13;
  summarized it by saying,     "Well,    what you are saying is that financial&#13;
&#13;
  flows worked for the developing countries in the '70s,                  but will work&#13;
&#13;
  against them in the '80s".        I said, "That's exactly right".&#13;
&#13;
           It did not take much thinking.        You did a projection with three&#13;
&#13;
  percent real interest rate, and the figures were jumping out.                  You needed&#13;
&#13;
  such enormous new loans that it was not conceivable that they should be&#13;
&#13;
  coming at that rate.&#13;
&#13;
           How could one organize a discussion about that?          I don't know.           I&#13;
&#13;
  was ideally placed in some sense.             But partly it was         the burden of&#13;
&#13;
 getting out the papers, so one had very little time.          I was working undue&#13;
&#13;
  hours.     McNamara would say it was a big job , "but no undue overtime";&#13;
&#13;
  one Friday evening he asked for something to be ready Monday morning, and&#13;
&#13;
  then he said "No overtime.   11&#13;
                                    Meaning, I suppose, only Saturday and Sunday&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      58&#13;
       The actual event that precipitated my plunge in 1985&#13;
was a lunch, at which I pontificated, as usual, about the&#13;
coming decline and fall of the dollar. And Qureshi said that&#13;
perhaps the "fundamentals had changed", and the dollar would&#13;
from now on stay high for some reason. And I thought, "this is&#13;
bubble talk", and I went straight from the dining room to the&#13;
Credit Union.&#13;
&#13;
                                           63&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Baneth, Page 64&#13;
&#13;
night but not beyond four o'clock in the morning or something.            Very&#13;
little time for debate.&#13;
         And the discussions were disorganized.    I don't know, but it's a&#13;
&#13;
fact that big topics somehow were not fully sorted out, and this was&#13;
&#13;
surely a    big topic.     On foreign exchange,   Qureshi commissioned Jack&#13;
&#13;
Polack to write some papers about what was predicting exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
movements and what was not;, but I guess that saying "look, these things&#13;
&#13;
might be dangerous" never came about. What counted was these        beautiful&#13;
$500 million profits one could be showing for financial operations last&#13;
month.    Then the whole thing came crashing down after '85, and that's why&#13;
the Bank changed policy.&#13;
Q:       Now, you carried on there until--&#13;
&#13;
A:       One year.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       One year, until 1980, or when did you then--?&#13;
A:       1980, the summer, and I guess I just was not very good at these&#13;
things.     I did not realize how one gets positions.    I did not go around&#13;
&#13;
asking for anything.       So one day Helen Hughes came to me and basically&#13;
Hollis had told her to offer me that position, so I said, "Okay."        I had&#13;
big fights with Helen but I thought (and that is true) that she was very&#13;
intelligent and I thought that was important, being intelligent.       One day&#13;
&#13;
I had told her (that was before I knew I would be depending on her)         "I&#13;
&#13;
think you are the second most obnoxious person in the      Bank"~   and then I&#13;
&#13;
added,    "Sometimes I wonder if you are not even more obnoxious than I am."&#13;
So she said, "But am I not right?" and I said, "Of course you are right."&#13;
&#13;
         So I accepted that position.    I guess Helen was not sure what she&#13;
&#13;
wanted, by that time.       She very much wanted to be a Vice President, to&#13;
&#13;
succeed Hollis, and she did not know how to get that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       You were there at the time when Hollis left?&#13;
&#13;
A:       That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       You,   I mean, you, in fact you had very little time with, with--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        64&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Baneth, Page 65&#13;
A:       No.     Hollis stayed quite for some time.     When I moved over there,&#13;
&#13;
i t was still McNamara/         and Hollis stayed well into the first year of&#13;
&#13;
Clausen.       I remember discussing a WDR in Clausen's office, when he said&#13;
&#13;
it     was     the    main   supervisor's   responsibility,     adding   "it's   your&#13;
&#13;
responsibility, Hollis", so obviously Hollis must have still been there.&#13;
And I don't know, Hollis was to be replaced by somebody, and that blew&#13;
&#13;
up, and then they started looking again.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Fishlaw(?), huh?&#13;
&#13;
A:       Fishlaw, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Now--&#13;
&#13;
A:       In fact, I was a discussant in a seminar of a paper to be presented&#13;
&#13;
by     Krueger when Shamsher Singh telephoned me saying that she was going&#13;
&#13;
to become Vice-President.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Uhuh.       Well, this would be very interesting now, to go over this&#13;
&#13;
in some detail, but we've now spent two hours and I suppose we'll have&#13;
&#13;
to leave it up to you.          Do you think you can do it some more?&#13;
&#13;
A:       I can go on some more now, but, I mean, I can also come back. Let&#13;
&#13;
me tell you something. I have asked Personnel, and in their kindness they&#13;
&#13;
grant that I can keep my office until January.                Now I Â·am not going to&#13;
&#13;
spend much time here, but I will spend some time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       So you will be here in January some--?&#13;
&#13;
A:       Yeah.       Not much at the office, but I will occasionally be there,&#13;
&#13;
yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       So, could we set you another meeting in January?&#13;
&#13;
A:       I would be happy, frankly, if it's before January, because I would&#13;
&#13;
really not like to be too bound, but if you can't do it, then, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Well, we have a bit of a problem there.&#13;
&#13;
A:       Okay.       If you have to, yes, send me a note, E-mail, I can tell you&#13;
&#13;
my dates of availability           to continue with this interview.--&#13;

&amp;#12;                         Interview with Jean Baneth&#13;
&#13;
                                     The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                     January 12, 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A:      I've had dealings with McNamara in his early days.                              CPP&#13;
&#13;
meetings were still quite serious, with the Chief Economist&#13;
&#13;
present.     I     had       also      met     him     when    he   visited        India.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously,       he    is    a       complex man.         In    some    ways       he   was&#13;
&#13;
extremely sharp.             He was also quite a man of culture. He&#13;
&#13;
read books.        He had an art collection,                   and God knows what&#13;
else.    He knew and was liked by intelligent people, although&#13;
&#13;
I    think even intelligent people can be influenced by the&#13;
&#13;
power of the interlocutor, they find qualities more likable&#13;
in a man who has power than a in man who lacks it.&#13;
&#13;
        And McNamara,            I    think,        clearly did     have     the    right&#13;
&#13;
vision for the World Bank in some ways,                             that he had to&#13;
&#13;
increase     its      role    and go against             some of       the   excessive&#13;
conservatism of many,                 including the then Treasurer,                 whose&#13;
&#13;
name I don't remember.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Cavanaugh?&#13;
A:      Cavanaugh. At the same time,                    McNamara was,        like many&#13;
clever or intelligent people, too reluctant to admit he was&#13;
&#13;
fallible and to admit problems.                      He preferred to assume them&#13;
away.    Most problems are soluble if you do everything right.&#13;
&#13;
So you can say, if you are an optimist, then do everything&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               66&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Baneth (1/12/95), Page 67&#13;
&#13;
  you        want,        "this    is    not    a    problem because         you     will   do&#13;
&#13;
  everything right and will                         resolve it. "         That was      fairly&#13;
  obvious, and on the record, in the case of Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
             When     I    was     putting      away       my   papers    after our       last&#13;
&#13;
 meeting, I found a letter of Escott Reid". That presumably&#13;
&#13;
  is my property,                 a personal letter of Escott Reid to Jean&#13;
&#13;
 Baneth.         I    had read the manuscript of his book on issues&#13;
&#13;
 pertaining to the World Bank.                               Obviously I     had told him&#13;
&#13;
  something about the volume increase in lending being good&#13;
&#13;
 but quality suffering, which I think is not a terribly novel&#13;
&#13;
  thing now.              It may not even have been then, but obviously it&#13;
&#13;
 was new to Escott, because he said in his letter that he had&#13;
&#13;
 put that statement to three other Bank people. Two of these&#13;
&#13;
 and         myself        agreed       but    the        fourth   one    said   that    only&#13;
&#13;
  imbeciles          believe        that      quality needs         to    suffer    actually&#13;
&#13;
 because of volume, or words to that effect.&#13;
&#13;
             It was not a position which McNamara was willing to&#13;
&#13;
  take, and in a sense a whole process of quasi-cheating was&#13;
&#13;
 put in place for that.                       There was the economic analysis of&#13;
&#13;
 projects. I could go on for many hours on this.                                   As I told&#13;
&#13;
 you at lunch, I recently wrote a report.                                It seems to me it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        59&#13;
       Escott Reid, a Canadian diplomat with a very&#13;
distinguished career behind him (including Ambassador to&#13;
India) was Director of the South Asia And Middle East&#13;
Department when I joined it in 1962; he retired in 1965.&#13;
Subsequently he wrote a book about the future of the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
                                                     67&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Baneth (1/12/95), Page 68&#13;
&#13;
was almost McNamara's dream as concocted by Vander Tak and&#13;
&#13;
Squire,     because here was       the    total     complexity of social&#13;
&#13;
considerations,       income distributions, environment               (even if&#13;
&#13;
it hardly existed in those days), whatever, all in the end&#13;
presented in a single figure.&#13;
&#13;
        Now,   many   economists    knew       it   was   nonsense.        Bela&#13;
&#13;
Balassa and I protested so strongly that Chenery formed a&#13;
&#13;
little committee of three to look at it and, as Bela put it&#13;
&#13;
a little wryly at some point, Van der Tak kept outvoting us.&#13;
Now,    presumably he     did not        outvote     us   on his    own,   but&#13;
&#13;
McNamara liked the rate of return. He thought everybody can&#13;
find    a   project   with   a   rate     of   return     higher    than    the&#13;
minimum.       And "if you do not find one, my little guy,                 then&#13;
&#13;
I   replace you".      And here,    this is not a field where you&#13;
&#13;
have to falsify body counts.             The plausible range is from 1&#13;
to 10, and if you can come up with 7, why should you not&#13;
&#13;
come up with 7 if you are certainly not encouraged to come&#13;
&#13;
up with 1?      That I think was very much McNamara's influence.&#13;
&#13;
        I was not close enough to him to see how he created a&#13;
process where few people ever actually contradicted him.                     It&#13;
&#13;
is not very difficult to do so in an organization with a&#13;
President as powerful as the World Bank's.                       I did go to&#13;
&#13;
several of his        meetings.     I remember one in particular,&#13;
&#13;
which struck me strongly because when McNamara came in he&#13;
said:    "This is an excellent report,              excellent.     We should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    68&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Baneth (1/12/95), Page 69&#13;
&#13;
have it printed.            What do you think,                Burke?".           You know,&#13;
this is not a management style which is likely to encourage&#13;
sharp and deep contradiction.&#13;
&#13;
       On the whole,         at the beginning,                despite the quality&#13;
problems, this went in the right direction.                               I am convinced&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was too stolid, needed to be woken up, had to go&#13;
&#13;
ahead.        It    was    right.         On    the       whole,    McNamara's       human&#13;
&#13;
interest and income distribution interest were probably,&#13;
&#13;
with hindsight,           right,     although I            remember quipping then&#13;
&#13;
that even the poor have to eat, so that it is not enough to&#13;
have     income      redistributing             projects,          you    also    have    to&#13;
&#13;
produce.&#13;
       But    on    the     whole,        it    worked.            When    it    comes    to&#13;
&#13;
duplicity and other things I just don't know how much there&#13;
&#13;
was.     How much sincerity and how much duplicity.                               My first&#13;
direct encounter with him was, I think, in '69.                                  I had led&#13;
a mission,         they were small missions in those days.                           I was&#13;
&#13;
still in India and I had led a mission to Iran.                                    He was&#13;
&#13;
going out there and I was asked by his speechwriter,                                (which&#13;
came     as   a    shock     to     me,    he       was    saying:        "This    is    Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's         speech writer, " or words                  to that effect,            and&#13;
coming from Europe,               one knows that there are people who&#13;
&#13;
write speeches for others,, but nobody would admit it).                                   He&#13;
&#13;
wanted to make a speech which was not too critical but which&#13;
also indicated that McNamara was not really fully satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               69&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Baneth {1/12/95), Page 70&#13;
&#13;
I thought, how admirable, here is somebody who does not want&#13;
&#13;
to sweep the dust under the carpet! But actually, he was not&#13;
&#13;
at all like that.             It came as a bit of a surprise. But it&#13;
&#13;
was not something quite nice.&#13;
&#13;
       Moving      on   in    Indonesia,    sorry,   before   he    came   to&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia--&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Can I ask on the quality aspect, McNamara, even today,&#13;
&#13;
is very upset about all this press saying he was neglecting&#13;
&#13;
quality.      He says:       "how can anybody blame me when I have&#13;
emphasized all along that quality is number one, and where&#13;
&#13;
in fact,      my intention clearly was to effectively deliver&#13;
&#13;
development assistance and not just numbers of projects and&#13;
&#13;
so on. "&#13;
&#13;
A:     That is absolutely true.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So,    now,    one thing is whether we selected the right&#13;
&#13;
kind of projects and the Squire-Van Der Tak method or some&#13;
&#13;
other method may have, misled us in that effort.                    But was&#13;
&#13;
that the major problem?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So where was it?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No.     I     think the Squire-Van Der Tak method did not&#13;
&#13;
mislead us in the sense of selecting the wrong projects.                   It&#13;
&#13;
just   left some people with the             impression that we had a&#13;
&#13;
method,      when we did not.          It was an excellent method for&#13;
&#13;
putting      the     rubber    stamp   on   what   was   selected   totally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       70&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Baneth (1/12/95), Page 71&#13;
&#13;
without reference to it ..&#13;
&#13;
        And it is totally true McNamara insisted on quality,&#13;
&#13;
and you can quote a thousand speeches where he talked about&#13;
it,    and   a    thousand CPPs.              But    staff,    Management,        direct&#13;
&#13;
pressures,        everything went the other way.                      Basically,     you&#13;
were supposed to be responsible for two things:                             delivering&#13;
&#13;
the numbers and adequate quality.                        And these two were of&#13;
&#13;
equal    importance           to     you.      But     while    the    numbers      were&#13;
&#13;
immediately visible, the quality is something which shows up&#13;
&#13;
20 years later.&#13;
        Furthermore, what was not really very well admitted is&#13;
&#13;
for you to say,             "Excuse me, Mr.President,               or Bob, in this&#13;
country, with this Treasury, there is no bloody way you can&#13;
&#13;
deliver quality in projects."                       He would then draw back and&#13;
&#13;
he would say,           "Yes, I fully agree with you," and you would&#13;
&#13;
find    yourself         at       best   pushing      paper    in   Ouagadougou       or&#13;
&#13;
wherever.          So       the    incentives        management       (in   my   paper,&#13;
&#13;
incidentally,           I     speak      of    incentives       management),         the&#13;
&#13;
incentives management works the wrong way; not sharply, but&#13;
&#13;
it does not make it easy for you to favor quality over&#13;
quantity.        McNamara never told anybody in Vietnam that he&#13;
wanted to get body counts just to publish them in the press.&#13;
&#13;
He never said it, and I am sure that he sincerely did not&#13;
want    that.       He       thought     the press was          important        because&#13;
&#13;
without the press he was not going to win the war, but that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              71&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Baneth (1/12/95), Page 72&#13;
&#13;
  was not really what he wanted.                     He wanted actually to kill&#13;
  the people.          But all the pressure was that if you could not&#13;
&#13;
  show the body count,                 then maybe there was something very&#13;
  wrong with what you are doing.                     So then commanders counted&#13;
&#13;
  those bodies, whether they were there or not, because others&#13;
 would do so anyway.&#13;
&#13;
           So those were the pressures, and they were enhanced by&#13;
 McNamara's           focusing     on numbers,        and really having great&#13;
&#13;
 difficulty understanding people and things.                     Now, this in a&#13;
  sense is          hindsight and I understood that very strongly in&#13;
&#13;
  Indonesia.          I got it in a variety of ways, but I will only&#13;
  speak of some of them. Remind me to speak of McNamara as&#13;
&#13;
 messenger, which was not very good, as I found out.&#13;
&#13;
           But to talk of McNamara as a viewer.                 He carne out to&#13;
&#13;
  Indonesia,          we    had   a     talk    on    transmigration     with   two&#13;
&#13;
 Ministers,          separately.         One of them was the Public Works&#13;
 Minister. He was a wonderful guy who could look and read the&#13;
&#13;
 mirror         backwards         in    German,       Dutch,   charts,    graphs,&#13;
&#13;
  nurnbers 60   â&#128;¢    This was a very good man,             said McNamara.       But&#13;
&#13;
  then     carne up        the other Minister who was            a   guy who had&#13;
  dealings with peasants and farmers' organizations, who had&#13;
&#13;
  been out in the field,                who expressed his views in halting&#13;
  English.          He said transmigration was very difficult.                  "How&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Upon re-reading, I find this repetitive. We old men do&#13;
      60&#13;
&#13;
go on,do we not, just?&#13;
                                               72&#13;

&#13;
many people can you push out?"             "Well,     I don't know.         You&#13;
&#13;
have to see how they fare, and so on".                He was dismissed by&#13;
&#13;
McNamara,      I do not mean to his face,             obviously,    but was&#13;
dismissed as being a no-account.                Yet he knew what he was&#13;
talking about.&#13;
&#13;
        Second, I did include the transmigration project in the&#13;
&#13;
field trips in Sumatra,         and not very often does McNamara&#13;
&#13;
travel among peasants with a staff member who can speak to&#13;
the peasant, which was my case.            And the peasants wanted to&#13;
speak     to   him.      By   the   way,    I    am    all   in    favor     of&#13;
&#13;
transmigration.        I think, on the whole, this was working and&#13;
&#13;
it is working,        it is the thing to do.          But it so happened,&#13;
that in that project there was a group of people who had&#13;
&#13;
been, between quotation marks, forced transmigrants.                       They&#13;
had been people whose land had been subject to a natural&#13;
&#13;
catastrophe in Java, so what the hell do you do?                   You have&#13;
&#13;
to ship them out.         They came from the Dieng Plateau, where&#13;
&#13;
carbon monoxide eruptions come and villages get wiped out,&#13;
and every time this happened the Government                   removed the&#13;
&#13;
encroaching villagers to Sumatra,               until others reentered.&#13;
Anyway, these people were not very happy. They were trying&#13;
&#13;
to explain some things to McNamara, that they did not have&#13;
&#13;
enough water -        a specific problem,        because they had been&#13;
shipped out in a hurry, in circumstances that were not easy.&#13;
&#13;
If I had been McNamara, as interested in people as he said&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    73&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 74&#13;
&#13;
he was, I would have listened; but he practically ran away.&#13;
&#13;
I   was   so bloody embarrassed!            I   had to remain there          and&#13;
&#13;
explain our failure to listen to them. Very embarrassing.&#13;
&#13;
He clearly was not interested; or if he had some interest,&#13;
&#13;
his fear overcame it.&#13;
&#13;
        A second example on the same trip_. The trip ended in&#13;
&#13;
Bali.     We went out in the field in Bali.              Well, maybe he did&#13;
&#13;
not     want   to   look   at    temples,       he   could   have   looked   at&#13;
&#13;
peasants again.       I    knew the way         Indonesians are.      I   could&#13;
&#13;
translate.      No, he wanted to go back to Jakarta early.                Now,&#13;
&#13;
of course the plane had been a special plane lent to him by&#13;
&#13;
the   Indonesians,        and they were not about to change their&#13;
&#13;
schedule, so we were at the airport for two hours, in Bali,&#13;
&#13;
out of a 24-hour period. The Governor of the Central Bank,&#13;
&#13;
who was Governor of the World Bank, was in his room chatting&#13;
&#13;
with his colleagues,            including Arifin Siregar, who is now&#13;
&#13;
the Ambassador here. I was trying to get them come early; I&#13;
&#13;
knew what the Governor was doing,                I knew what McNamara was&#13;
&#13;
doing. He spent all these hours at the airport in Bali. It&#13;
&#13;
is not a way to find out if your numbers are wrong.&#13;
&#13;
        It is good to go by numbers, but occasionally you have&#13;
&#13;
to plunge down into the field, or encourage people to plunge&#13;
&#13;
down into the field,         and check up.           This he was not doing.&#13;
&#13;
He is right, he did not want bad quality projects, he is not&#13;
&#13;
a crook (but I am of the impression it was not he who used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      74&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Baneth (1/12/95), Page 75&#13;
&#13;
that particular phrase) .          But anyway,           he did not want bad&#13;
&#13;
quality projects,        but he did not put into place a system&#13;
&#13;
which provided for good quality projects. On the contrary,&#13;
&#13;
he put into place a system which encouraged everybody to get&#13;
&#13;
up with the numbers rather than the quality. That was how&#13;
&#13;
the whole lending program thing worked,                       you know that as&#13;
&#13;
well as I do.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      For the record.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I know it's for the record.                Now, how does it come out&#13;
&#13;
on balance with McNamara?            I    think he did a lot for the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     On balance,        I think it is positive.                Now, is it as&#13;
&#13;
positive as some other fellow would have been?                            I   don't&#13;
&#13;
know. How could I know?           We have seen worse since, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What about the argument that he sort of pushed the Bank&#13;
&#13;
at the wrong time?           In a sense, he was pushing the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
lend when everybody else was lending,                     and when everybody&#13;
&#13;
else felt they couldn't lend any more, when the debt crisis&#13;
&#13;
had arrived.        The Bank in a sense was also in a position&#13;
&#13;
where--&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.      That   is   certainly    true,         but    that   thing   is   a&#13;
&#13;
separate issue.         The problem there,              I can send you,       did I&#13;
&#13;
send you a memo about creditworthiness?                       No?&#13;
&#13;
Q:      No.     I think you mentioned it the last time.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well,    I have to find it.            I have it somewhere in my&#13;
&#13;
files.        When I    came back in      I   79   1   suddenly everybody was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     75&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 76&#13;
&#13;
  talking        about    what   would     happen     when    commercial    banks&#13;
&#13;
  stopped lending, what problems would be encountered and so&#13;
&#13;
  on,        so financial    flows were discussed,           how do we get the&#13;
&#13;
  money,        the   "Bank's bank" 61 â&#128;¢     I     guess all these terms are&#13;
&#13;
  somewhere in the file.           So I sat down and started looking at&#13;
&#13;
  things and some time early in 1980, when I had thought about&#13;
&#13;
  it    a     lot,    and read other notes          about    the   tightening of&#13;
&#13;
  markets,       rising interest rates,            and so on,      I sat down and&#13;
&#13;
  wrote a memo to Georg Gabriel, saying there were two ways of&#13;
&#13;
  looking at the financial problem62 â&#128;¢                 One way of looking at&#13;
&#13;
  it is that the banks will still have plenty of money and the&#13;
&#13;
  developing countries will                still    have plenty of need and&#13;
&#13;
  ability to service the money,                  however,    for some reason -&#13;
&#13;
  capital ratios,           God knows what           there will be a market&#13;
&#13;
  failure, the money will not come, and therefore we have to&#13;
&#13;
  constitute a new intermediary.                 Another way of looking at it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        61&#13;
       That idea was most openly favored by Gene Rothberg, but&#13;
I do not know who invented it. It is a good example of&#13;
fascination with financial engineering.The idea was for the&#13;
World Bank to take a small amount of its capital, put it into&#13;
a separate institution, which would borrow up to twenty times&#13;
that amount and re-lend it at floating rates. Doing what Chase&#13;
did, only better! Fortunately, it was never implemented; but&#13;
it is a good illustration of the way many people were then&#13;
looking at developing countries' capital problems: they were&#13;
not afraid of too much borrowing, but only that one day, for&#13;
some mysterious technical reason, the commercial banks would&#13;
curtail it; so the World Bank had to be ready to jump in and&#13;
pick u the torch from their hands.&#13;
        62&#13;
       Obviously, I am again repeating myself. Is it because I&#13;
think the issue is important? or because I think I am?&#13;
                                            76&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 77&#13;
&#13;
is   that,    there      is no market            failure,   but the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries         will   lack the        creditworthiness,      will   lack the&#13;
&#13;
means,     in some       sense,     to    use     commercial money in large&#13;
&#13;
amounts.      And I thought the problem was the second, rather&#13;
&#13;
than the first, and if that was the case, the remedy was to&#13;
&#13;
be very different.               It is structural adjustment, and more&#13;
&#13;
aid if you want,               but not these commercial loans.            And I&#13;
&#13;
asked him to please discuss this with Mr. McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
      I do not know how energetically Georg took it up, but&#13;
&#13;
I was told that was not the question asked, as they said at&#13;
&#13;
the Zola trial . . . . . So I was told to go ahead and deal with&#13;
&#13;
the other problem.&#13;
&#13;
      Now, I think the problem, that was McNamara, but it was&#13;
&#13;
also the whole techno-structure which did not go back up to&#13;
&#13;
McNamara and say          11&#13;
                               that is nonsense!" at least once,           11&#13;
                                                                                YOU&#13;
&#13;
should not do it this way".                 11&#13;
                                                 Thatâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢ was the projections at&#13;
&#13;
one percent real interest rate (and even with one percent,&#13;
&#13;
Isenman tells me the projections did not work out.                      So thee&#13;
&#13;
was something called the                  "Delta file" to prove what was                                ~&#13;
desired, and the people who were doing that,                                                      ...   Â·{&#13;

only for the truth."              But certainly, there was a structure&#13;
&#13;
in place that did not encourage enough contradiction and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           77&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 78&#13;
&#13;
  debate.&#13;
&#13;
   Coming back to project quality, if you take the word in a&#13;
&#13;
  very    limited sense,     I    think our problem was              not   really&#13;
&#13;
  project quality. It was not that we chose the wrong bridges.&#13;
&#13;
  It was that we did not refuse to lend when prices were out&#13;
&#13;
  of kilter,     or what have you.           And,    similarly, we did not&#13;
&#13;
  refuse    to   lend when       they   were      borrowing    too   much    from&#13;
&#13;
  commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
          It was easy to do that, because if the World Bank had&#13;
&#13;
 proclaimed even mezzo voce, "We are not lending because this&#13;
&#13;
  country goes beyond the bounds of creditworthiness, " even in&#13;
  the '70s the banks would not have lent.                     They would have&#13;
&#13;
 argued,     they would    have gone         to    the    Congress    (which is&#13;
&#13;
 exactly what they did for Indonesia,                    saying "What is this&#13;
&#13;
  interference with free markets?") but they would not have&#13;
  lent, because, even then, the risk of lending in the face of&#13;
&#13;
 a World Bank pronouncement was strong 63 â&#128;¢                   But against the&#13;
&#13;
 wish of the Government,           we rarely did that; very rarely.&#13;
&#13;
 The Indonesia reports did not. A statement was made on their&#13;
&#13;
  creditworthiness. But certainly, if the Indonesians, those&#13;
&#13;
 who counted, had been really unhappy with this, they would&#13;
&#13;
  have gotten my head in a basket with sawdust, and that would&#13;
&#13;
  have been the end of it.          As it is, it worked because they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     63&#13;
       I mean for the individual bankers and managers. They&#13;
knew that if things then did go wrong, they would have no&#13;
excuse if they had gone against World bank pronouncements.&#13;
&#13;
                                        78&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Baneth {1/12/95), Page 79&#13;
&#13;
wanted it to work, at least many of them wanted it to work.&#13;
&#13;
        But it could have been worked if the Bank had really&#13;
&#13;
wanted that, if it had said, "okay, Brazil is borrowing too&#13;
&#13;
much.     Let us stop it".&#13;
&#13;
        Now, there were genuine disagreements in the analyses.&#13;
&#13;
Helen Hughes was certainly not influenced by what McNamara&#13;
&#13;
wanted.      She disliked McNamara.        Yet she thought it was&#13;
&#13;
fine,    how much better it was for Brazil,      the "debt-driven&#13;
&#13;
strategy" and so on.     But there was not a real debate, and&#13;
&#13;
in lending, more was in general thought "a good thing", let&#13;
&#13;
us admit it. And by the way,       I do not recall seeing a hell&#13;
&#13;
of a lot of warning about Mexico borrowing too much,          last&#13;
&#13;
year.     Maybe there was, but I don't recall seeing anything&#13;
&#13;
on that either.&#13;
&#13;
        So it was not just McNamara. It was the structure. How&#13;
&#13;
much did this attitude put the Bank in a bad position?           I&#13;
&#13;
think    there we   come to the    last,   and saddest,   stage of&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's life.&#13;
&#13;
        At the beginning, McNamara proclaimed impossible ideas&#13;
&#13;
and by sacrificing 20 percent of them, he made 80 percent&#13;
&#13;
come true, even if that was not all good.         But this sort of&#13;
&#13;
proclaiming far-away goals worked, the system was there.&#13;
&#13;
        I was at his last Board meeting, when he was outlining&#13;
&#13;
further goals for the Bank.       It was pathetic, because it was&#13;
&#13;
so far from the realities of the day, the new Administration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  79&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Baneth (1/12/95), Page 80&#13;
&#13;
was having a study whether the World Bank should subsist at&#13;
&#13;
all. McNamara, in the '70s         he could genuinely have thought&#13;
&#13;
that in the early '80s we will get a capital increase. So,&#13;
&#13;
in some sense the crunch of the Bank came partly because of&#13;
&#13;
possibly too much lending then, very much because there was&#13;
&#13;
the other crunch, the debt crisis, but also because Bank/IDA&#13;
&#13;
expansion was not what he had hoped, and indeed what he had&#13;
&#13;
negotiated for IDA.      All these things came together to limit&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's ability to act, until the Baker speech.&#13;
&#13;
       The capital increase. I was no longer in Finance then,&#13;
&#13;
but I followed these things well.          The capital size was very&#13;
&#13;
much a constraint, I would say, between '82 and '85. Not an&#13;
&#13;
immediate     constraint,   but   because we     had no     clue    as   to&#13;
&#13;
whether the U.S. would ever agree to an increase.              And that&#13;
&#13;
was why the Baker speech was important, because he had said&#13;
&#13;
"not now, but when you need it you'll get it," or words to&#13;
&#13;
that effect.&#13;
&#13;
       McNamara was not alone. But yes, I think he contributed&#13;
&#13;
a lot to this sort of thing,            to the disregard of looming&#13;
&#13;
problems.&#13;
       Now, I will speak of McNamara as a messenger.               That is&#13;
&#13;
particularly something we, you and I, surely experienced in&#13;
&#13;
India and in Indonesia.           To be in the field, you have to&#13;
&#13;
have   good    relations    (mostly     good   relations)    with     your&#13;
&#13;
Government.      Now,   you can perfectly well        transmit a bad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   80&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 81&#13;
&#13;
message, if you say "well, boys, I of course love you, but&#13;
&#13;
there     in     Washington         they      are       really    insisting        that&#13;
&#13;
corruption should not go beyond five percent of GNP",                                or&#13;
&#13;
whatever.            To    do   that,      you     have    to    have,   at     least&#13;
&#13;
notionally,          somebody high up delivering some of the same&#13;
message from time to time.                 And sure as hell, when he went&#13;
&#13;
to Iran, or when he came to Indonesia, he did not deliver&#13;
&#13;
anything of the sort.             I don't know how it was in India, but&#13;
&#13;
that I think this was another failure on his part.&#13;
&#13;
     He loved to be loved.                   I think that was why he was a&#13;
failure with those peasants,                    because they were obviously&#13;
&#13;
complaining about something.                 He would speak very harsh and&#13;
&#13;
excessive       language        about   corruption,         human    rights,       land&#13;
reform, what have you,              in general terms, but he would not&#13;
&#13;
even hint at delivering the message.                      In that sense, I think&#13;
&#13;
poor George Woods with his "dwindle into despondency", was&#13;
&#13;
a much,&#13;
Q:   Well, McNamara--&#13;
&#13;
A:      --he was better.&#13;
Q:      --McNamara had,          as far as I        can make out,        this firm&#13;
&#13;
belief    that       the    owner    and     the    shareholder      that     he   was&#13;
&#13;
serving        was     always       right.       When     he     dealt   with       the&#13;
shareholders he was very careful about how he--&#13;
&#13;
A:      He did not have the belief, because when he was there,&#13;
in a private meeting, and mentioned "this corruption"                                to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           81&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 82&#13;
&#13;
me. He much exaggerated, in fact.                  In Indonesia things were&#13;
&#13;
not    half    as   bad as   he    put     them.     He    said   it   had    "more&#13;
corruption than any except perhaps one other country", and&#13;
I had about nineteen countries going through my mind,                          and&#13;
&#13;
wondering       "which one does he mean?".                But when he was over&#13;
&#13;
there, he did not deliver this theme in his message.&#13;
&#13;
       Industrial policy; I got out a memorandum on industrial&#13;
&#13;
policy from a Minister by claiming that McNamara needed more&#13;
&#13;
comments. But in fact, McNamara did not even hint that the&#13;
&#13;
hogwash which he had been served up was not the best thing&#13;
&#13;
in the world.          I   do not    think      that      is quite the       right&#13;
&#13;
behavior. Obviously, you don't want to go into the country&#13;
&#13;
and then start hitting the table, but it certainly helps to&#13;
&#13;
do a bit of that in a very mild way.                      You can always refer&#13;
&#13;
to your shareholders, the other shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I suppose there was also, to some extent, at least in&#13;
&#13;
the    early    years,     the    belief      that   the     solution    to    the&#13;
&#13;
development problem was something that ultimately could be&#13;
&#13;
brought from the outside.                The transfer of resources was&#13;
&#13;
clearly one way of tackling this problem.                    And the fact that&#13;
&#13;
the behavior of the developing countries themselves had much&#13;
&#13;
to do with the solution of these problems, poverty or what&#13;
&#13;
not,   came only when the oil crisis had made it absolutely&#13;
&#13;
clear that there was no amount in the world that could--&#13;
&#13;
A:     No.     I don't think so.          I remember our discussions on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         82&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth {1/12/95), Page 83&#13;
&#13;
Sri Lanka,       which was well before the oil crisis,                   and how&#13;
their    policies       were      responsible.         And McNamara,     at    CPP&#13;
&#13;
meetings       and    the   like,     would      be   quite   critical   of    the&#13;
&#13;
country.        That    just somehow did not get               translated into&#13;
&#13;
either his message or into the lending program.&#13;
&#13;
        Don't get me wrong.           Again,      I think that, on balance,&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's actions were rather positive. The Bank is still&#13;
living them, so what happens to the Bank in the future will&#13;
&#13;
also     to    some     extent      reflect      on   how     positive   an    era&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's actually was.                  But he did create a mentality,&#13;
where country problems were not directly linked to the only&#13;
&#13;
thing to which we can link them, which is lending volumes,&#13;
&#13;
I suppose.&#13;
        Well, two things, lending volumes and speaking up.                    And&#13;
&#13;
I   suspect he contributed to a staff and personnel policy&#13;
&#13;
which did not encourage outspokenness.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, we have discussed this at lunch.                  There are always&#13;
&#13;
various       things.       But     you   need    followers,     and you      need&#13;
outspoken       figures.       The Bank did have a              few mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
before McNamara, which allowed outspokenness.                      As I recall,&#13;
way back before the First World War,                     there was the Staff&#13;
&#13;
Economic Committee.            These were economists,            they were not&#13;
&#13;
committed to any one lending program, and did they tear into&#13;
&#13;
each other's reports and comments.                    They may not have been&#13;
terribly well informed, because they had no staff looking at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           83&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 84&#13;
&#13;
the other's country, but they moved around, they could look&#13;
&#13;
at numbers, and they discussed it. This really disappeared.&#13;
&#13;
        When you meet under the chairmanship of the Regional&#13;
&#13;
Vice-President, most people pretty soon learn that this is&#13;
&#13;
not the time when you say,                   11&#13;
                                                  your country is awful".       At&#13;
&#13;
most, you say that this CPP does not make a very good case.&#13;
&#13;
So     this     outspokenness,         the        possibility    of   raising   new&#13;
&#13;
issues,       disappeared. Â·         No mechanism was put in place for&#13;
&#13;
discussing things internally, as distinct from the external&#13;
&#13;
image.        Also there was a feeding of newspapers,                    I suspect&#13;
&#13;
sometimes by McNamara himself,                      which discouraged internal&#13;
&#13;
debate;       then he could always say,                "Aaah, I see, I thought&#13;
this was internal, and it went out''Â·&#13;
Q:      Okay.      Now,       in 1980 you shifted to the Development&#13;
&#13;
Policy,       to the Economic side.                  How did this come about?&#13;
&#13;
After all, you had spent only a year,                    but~-&#13;
&#13;
A:      I came back from Indonesia under a Husain cloud, let us&#13;
&#13;
say.     He became very hostile. I suppose he also blamed me-&#13;
&#13;
partly wrongly64          -   for Ping Loh being turned down by the&#13;
&#13;
Indonesians,        and       then   Stanley        Please   had   his   problems.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway,       I had long been told by Shahid that I should come&#13;
                                                                                                     Â·~&#13;

&#13;
 back     only   when   I   get    a   Director's   position.   Then,   he&#13;
&#13;
 suddenly told me I will not get a Director's position, but&#13;
&#13;
  I did not have the option to stay out. Later, he wrote that&#13;
&#13;
 there was this position available.               In all honesty,   I now&#13;
 realize from his letter that he did really say that it was&#13;
&#13;
 a temporary position.            I did not so understand when I read&#13;
&#13;
 the letter, because I remember it was a surprise to me, when&#13;
&#13;
  I found out that it was a one-year sort of thing.             But I did&#13;
&#13;
 it for one year.           We put out innumerable papers,       but Joe&#13;
&#13;
 Wood 65 was coming back.         Qureshi said I could stay with him,&#13;
&#13;
 but with no particular position,               and I guess Chenery had&#13;
&#13;
 prevailed over Helen Hughes,               to come up and offer me the&#13;
&#13;
 Deputy's position,         because Russ was going out to replace&#13;
&#13;
 Stanley Please, who had come back after three months from&#13;
&#13;
  Indonesia.&#13;
          I had been looking at that several years earlier. When&#13;
&#13;
 Gulhati was leaving, Chenery discussed that Department with&#13;
&#13;
 me. I was in Indonesia, I had just arrived there, and I said&#13;
&#13;
  I would rather stay in Indonesia, or words to that effect.&#13;
&#13;
 That also is in my file,          so is my memorandum, in this file&#13;
&#13;
 to which I have referred earlier.              In 1980 nobody else came&#13;
&#13;
 up, and I was not very good at asking.               The only person I&#13;
&#13;
 had asked while I was still in Indonesia, was David Hopper,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     65&#13;
       He had gone on "sabbatical", and I was there only, as&#13;
someone put it, "to keep his seat warm for him".&#13;
                                       85&#13;

&#13;
 when       Manfred       died.   I   felt        it    was   half   indecent,    but&#13;
&#13;
 nevertheless         I    had known David Hopper,              and I   said I   was&#13;
&#13;
 really interested. He later told me that it was "No", that&#13;
&#13;
 Mike Wiehen would be given the position. I had not gone to&#13;
&#13;
 anybody else, asking, and when this came up I took it.                          It's&#13;
&#13;
 that simple 66 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        And there you worked with Helen Hughes?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Yes.    For about two years or so, before she left for&#13;
&#13;
 the Australian National University.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        What did you do exactly?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        Well,   it was a very difficult thing, because in some&#13;
&#13;
 sense that was a powerful position; it was                          nothing and it&#13;
&#13;
 was everything.            Helen traveled a lot, so when she was away&#13;
&#13;
  I did everything,           subject to the knowledge that she would&#13;
&#13;
 probably contradict a lot of it when she came back.                              We&#13;
&#13;
 fought quite a lot, but in a sort of reasonably good-humored&#13;
&#13;
 way.       I disagreed with her on almost everything.                    She would&#13;
&#13;
 scribble things like "it's absolutely nonsense" and so on.&#13;
&#13;
 But we got along as we could.                         After a little while,     she&#13;
&#13;
 basically made Shamsher Singh my equivalent. She said, "you&#13;
&#13;
  will get a special responsibility, you will supervise three&#13;
&#13;
 Divisions, and he will supervise three Divisions".                          But in&#13;
&#13;
  reality, when she was there she more or less did everything;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      66&#13;
       Upon re-reading, of course I realize all this is&#13;
repetitive.&#13;
                                             86&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 87&#13;
&#13;
when she was not there, then I did a lot of things for her.&#13;
&#13;
So it was not terribly exciting, nor did it look that way.&#13;
&#13;
Again,       I had forgotten about much of this, and when I was&#13;
&#13;
packing and looked at some things I wrote in those days, I&#13;
realized it was not the happiest time of my life.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         The name of the Department was--&#13;
A:         Economic Analysis and Projection.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         --Economic Analysis and Projections [EPD].                   Now--&#13;
&#13;
A:         By the way, one interesting--&#13;
&#13;
Q:         There's still doubt in terms of economic analysis 67 - -&#13;
&#13;
A:         Well, in some ways because it was very primitive, when&#13;
&#13;
I look back.         We had several sources of data, some of them&#13;
from the Bank,         some of them from the outside.                    The Bank&#13;
&#13;
itself        used   different    sets       of    data,   so     the     standard&#13;
&#13;
occurrence in those days was that if some education project&#13;
&#13;
comes up, which says the literacy rate is 37 percent, and&#13;
&#13;
one of the Executive Directors said, "Well, how come in the&#13;
beginning of the book, or the end, whatever, the comparative&#13;
&#13;
statistics side says the literacy rate is 90 percent, or 20&#13;
&#13;
percent or whatever?"            we would answer "Aaah, those are the&#13;
internationally comparable data that are cited,                         these are&#13;
&#13;
the        country   statistics    they       have."       That     was    pretty&#13;
&#13;
primitive, and Helen had already asked Nick Hope to start a&#13;
computerization         reform     of    the       debt    data     processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      67   ???&#13;
&#13;
                                        87&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Baneth (1/12/95), Page 88&#13;
&#13;
Commodities were more or less as they always were and always&#13;
&#13;
will be,     I    suppose,   if they subsist.           Then there was the&#13;
Systems Division which was trying to work on this, putting&#13;
&#13;
in new computer systems;           then there was something called&#13;
International       something      and      trade,     IECIT,     international&#13;
&#13;
trade, which was the one doing the projections for WDR in a&#13;
&#13;
very primitive sort of way, and not much knowledge of the&#13;
&#13;
world economy.       Basically, Helen's slogan was "these are not&#13;
projections,        these    are       assumptions",            extrapolations,&#13;
whatever ....&#13;
&#13;
     One     of    the   things    I     tried    to    do,     even   from   the&#13;
beginning, was to move to projections.                    In a sense,     I had&#13;
&#13;
that partly,       already, when I had convinced McNamara that,&#13;
&#13;
instead of just having a common inflation figure,                       we also&#13;
&#13;
ought to have a common interest rate figure.                       After that,&#13;
the exchange rate; you have to have a lot of things going&#13;
&#13;
into that, so we started, even while Helen was there, on the&#13;
&#13;
international economy with Peter Miovic and company.&#13;
     Then I got Helen convinced that we should really be&#13;
&#13;
writing the first part of the WDR.                   By that time, she was&#13;
&#13;
very much keen on getting out.                 She was struggling a lot&#13;
finding her new job, so she did not mind, and after that we&#13;
did draft it. That was the last WDR before the debt crisis,&#13;
&#13;
and again,       rereading a telegram I           sent from Paris around&#13;
April or May,       I am really surprised at myself, because it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       88&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Baneth (1/12/95), Page 89&#13;
&#13;
 was pretty clear,             the criticism was heavily on Euro--no,&#13;
&#13;
 sorry, I am anticipating.&#13;
&#13;
            We wrote something, which was then rejected by the Core&#13;
&#13;
  Team, which started doing something on its own. That went to&#13;
&#13;
 Clausen. He was pretty good at these things.                    I    was there at&#13;
&#13;
 the        meeting,     he   said something like,        "You       know,   when   I&#13;
&#13;
  travel around the world, the first book which I see on every&#13;
&#13;
 Minister's, every President's desk, is the World Development&#13;
&#13;
 Report, and these have usually pretty high quality. This one&#13;
&#13;
 does not meet that standard", or words to that effect.                         Then&#13;
&#13;
 he said "I guess it's your problem, Hollis".                    Because Hollis&#13;
&#13;
  [Chenery] was still there, but Hollis did not take it very&#13;
&#13;
 well.           So then, they wanted to come back to our draft. Bevan&#13;
&#13;
 was the Chief".              I said,    "No, look,   I have a mission,          I'm&#13;
&#13;
 going on to a meeting."                Then they picked pieces from here&#13;
&#13;
 and there, and out came an awful garbage.                     The second part&#13;
&#13;
 of that WDR was not too good either, by the way, but anyway,&#13;
&#13;
 Part        I     was   an   awful     garbage,    and   it   was      still    too&#13;
&#13;
 optimistic, particularly in the financial and other issues.&#13;
&#13;
            Now, I w ill not say that I wrote in my telegram, "and&#13;
&#13;
 don't forget that Mexico will have a debt crisis in August,"&#13;
&#13;
 because I did not.             But it was clear that, for a variety of&#13;
&#13;
  reasons, somehow the Bank had not focused on the fact that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       68&#13;
        Turnham was heading the Core Team, and Bevan Waide had&#13;
some form of overall responsibility for the Report.&#13;
                                           89&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Baneth (1/12/95), Page 90&#13;
&#13;
(a) short-term interest rates - everything was tied to that-&#13;
&#13;
were up very high;          (b)    that there was a global recession,&#13;
&#13;
and therefore trade was suffering; and (c)                    that developing&#13;
&#13;
countries had borrowed so much that, in order to maintain a&#13;
&#13;
net resource inflow, they had to borrow every year something&#13;
&#13;
like 90 times the GNP, or whatever.                   That was somehow not in&#13;
&#13;
the   balance.      It    was     easy,     looking    at   those   things,    to&#13;
&#13;
forecast     that        there     was      serious     trouble     ahead,    not&#13;
&#13;
necessarily trouble             in the     sense of     "they can't repay",&#13;
&#13;
trouble perhaps in the sense that "they'll have to pull in&#13;
&#13;
their belts terribly tightly in order to repay".                       But that&#13;
&#13;
was pretty clear.&#13;
&#13;
      Helen was not really in agreement with that,                      but she&#13;
&#13;
was reasonably supportive.                 She did not mind our sticking&#13;
&#13;
our heads out, and we did, and we wrote it, and then it was&#13;
&#13;
rejected,    and I don't even know where that draft is now.&#13;
&#13;
All I have is my comments on the new draft.&#13;
&#13;
      I could never quite find out what Helen thought about&#13;
&#13;
me, but I'm not terribly curious about these things.                     I know&#13;
&#13;
she did not particularly recommend me to                    Krueger.   That was&#13;
&#13;
when, in '83?       I can't remember.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    When you were promoted?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes.&#13;
Q:    That was when she left.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes.   When was that?               '83?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           90&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Baneth (1/12/95), Page 91&#13;
&#13;
Q:     That was in '83, I think.&#13;
&#13;
A:     So I guess I spent three years with her.                   It did not&#13;
&#13;
quite look like that long -               '81,   '80-'81,      '81-'82,    '83,&#13;
yes, three years, boy!&#13;
&#13;
       My recollection is that it was in the winter of '82,&#13;
&#13;
now that you mention it.         Maybe.     Helen did not recommend me&#13;
&#13;
to [Anne Krueger] , and my suspicion is that she recommended&#13;
&#13;
against, but I do not really know.               I went to Anne, whom I&#13;
had known but not very well. We had met at meetings, and I&#13;
&#13;
said I would like to be considered for Director.                   This time&#13;
&#13;
I did ask.       And she said that she would have to think about&#13;
it.    And luckily, something else was offered at that time,&#13;
&#13;
not    something    I   keenly   desired     but    it   was    okay,     Chief&#13;
&#13;
Economist in West Africa; Knox asked me.                    So I told Knox&#13;
&#13;
that    Anne was considering me, and I would like to have my&#13;
response pending.       I told each about the other's offer.               And&#13;
&#13;
I told Knox that I would accept the Directorship, if it was&#13;
&#13;
offered.     And he said, "but anything else?".                I said,    "No".&#13;
And I went to Anne, and after a while she decided to take&#13;
&#13;
me.    We discussed economics a little.            I told her that I was&#13;
&#13;
not quite as right -wing as she is.                I told her that,         for&#13;
instance,    I    do not   think public sector management needs&#13;
necessarily to be a catastrophe.                 She said,     "Not even in&#13;
Africa?"     I said not even in Africa, by itself.                 There are&#13;
&#13;
other things.      Anyway, that was how I got there, and we went&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    91&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 92&#13;
&#13;
  to   transform IEC 69 ,      or continued transforming it,                     into a&#13;
&#13;
  much more analytical place.                     And in that,         I think Anne's&#13;
&#13;
  instincts      were      good.    She   may      not     have   wanted       the    same&#13;
&#13;
  analysis,      but she wanted real analysis.                    She did not want&#13;
&#13;
  what she called "mindless modeling",                      when you build up a&#13;
&#13;
 postulate and then you develop the 900 variants which depend&#13;
&#13;
  on    it,    but   you    don't     have    a     clue    as    to    what    are    the&#13;
&#13;
 possibilities that your postulate is valid.                            We went into&#13;
&#13;
  real forecasting.          We gradually changed the staff,                    without&#13;
&#13;
  ever actually dismissing anybody.                   We made foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
  and interest rate forecasts.                    And also tried unifying Bank&#13;
&#13;
  statistics,        trying to get a common data base, which meant&#13;
&#13;
  checking with country economists.                      It was like fusing the&#13;
&#13;
  "internationally comparable" and the other data, trying to&#13;
&#13;
 get a single thing, which meant having interaction with the&#13;
&#13;
  country economists.              In my judgment, it worked pretty well,&#13;
&#13;
 but obviously that's my judgment.&#13;
&#13;
            And then debt took up an increasing amount of energy.&#13;
&#13;
 The Debt Tables' Preface was actually started under Helen.&#13;
&#13;
  The first Preface was written by Rupert Pennet- Ray, who is&#13;
&#13;
 now the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England 70 , because in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       69&#13;
            Actually, then still EPD.&#13;
&#13;
       No longer. He had to resign when his ex-mistress&#13;
       70&#13;
&#13;
publicized their ex-relationship, including details about&#13;
love-making in the Governor's office (was it on his desk?)&#13;
Those economists sure live!&#13;
     When he worked for us, he was a Deputy Editor at the&#13;
                                             92&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 93&#13;
&#13;
 EPD there was no capacity for it.                    And then, gradually, we&#13;
&#13;
 put in more capacity, and we also used a lot of consultants,&#13;
&#13;
 and then we started using the Preface as a policy message,&#13;
&#13;
 not going exactly against official analysis but, testing the&#13;
&#13;
 limits, how far we could go.&#13;
&#13;
          In   fact,   we   tested them pretty            thoroughly,      because&#13;
&#13;
 once, in '86, it was just before the French elections, the&#13;
&#13;
 French intervened. They had got hold of the discussion paper&#13;
&#13;
 which     preceded     the      Preface,      and    intervened    very    heavy-&#13;
&#13;
 handedly,       saying     we     were     too      demanding     in    terms   of&#13;
&#13;
 rescheduling and so on. We had to modify certain words. That&#13;
&#13;
 was all the more amusing as,                right after that,          it was the&#13;
&#13;
 elections and Chirac came in, and the first thing Chirac did&#13;
&#13;
 was to visit the Ivory Coast; and Roulet 71 sent me a press&#13;
&#13;
 clipping. The journalist was supposed to have asked what he&#13;
&#13;
 thought about debt. Chirac said, "I am in agreement with the&#13;
&#13;
 analysis of Jean Baneth,            of the World Bank,            who says that&#13;
  there is a need to change                 the   fundamental      conditions of&#13;
&#13;
 debt", and so on.          Of course, Chirac had never heard of Jean&#13;
&#13;
 Baneth, and presumably it was the journalist who put it that&#13;
&#13;
 way; he had presumably asked if Chirac had agreed with my&#13;
&#13;
 analysis, and he had answered "oh, yeah!". But nevertheless&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Economist, and reportedly needed money for his recent divorce&#13;
settlement.&#13;
     71&#13;
          The Bank's Mission Chief.&#13;
&#13;
                                          93&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Baneth (1/12/95), Page 94&#13;
&#13;
that was the quote, so I went to Madame Ploix, saying that&#13;
&#13;
obviously if the Treasury had got upset with me, they must&#13;
have got downset since.&#13;
&#13;
        So debt took an increasing amount of analysis and time&#13;
&#13;
and budget resources, we tended to put a lot of those into&#13;
&#13;
debt analysis and into the projections and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Can you talk a little bit about,                      first perhaps about&#13;
&#13;
Hollis and his contribution to the                       economic work of         the&#13;
&#13;
Bank,    and then about          Krueger's and how your work in the&#13;
&#13;
Department fitted into her picture?&#13;
&#13;
A:      You know, funnily, I liked Hollis.                    He was a tremendous&#13;
&#13;
gentleman.          He   also   did    a    lot    of    things    to   strengthen&#13;
&#13;
economic analysis at the Bank,                   to bring out publications.&#13;
&#13;
You know that when I came to the Bank, it did not publish.&#13;
&#13;
I had written before I came to the Bank, the only time I got&#13;
&#13;
paid    for   it,    I    got   $100   in       1959    for    an article    I    had&#13;
&#13;
written.      But then I wrote something, and my boss thought it&#13;
&#13;
was very good.           It had to be submitted to the Department&#13;
&#13;
Director,     who    said he      thought         it   was very good,       but    it&#13;
&#13;
should be published under an assumed name. He checked with&#13;
&#13;
Burke Knapp, who vetoed it.                In those days, Bank staff did&#13;
&#13;
not publish.         The Fund already had the Staff Papers.                       The&#13;
&#13;
Bank had nothing.           Hollis changed that.                Hollis brought in&#13;
&#13;
research.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, for my taste, Hollis was too numbers-oriented.                        It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           94&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth (1/12/95), Page 95&#13;
&#13;
is not that he did not know that the numbers were garbage,&#13;
but it was a little like the guy who lost his pen in the&#13;
&#13;
dining-room, but it's in the bedroom that there is light, so&#13;
&#13;
he better look for it in the bedroom because in the dark he&#13;
has no chance of finding it.                         So, we would have a talk and&#13;
&#13;
agree     that    all       these    numbers           were      garbage    and   it   was&#13;
&#13;
impossible to forecast anything.                           Then he would say "Okay,&#13;
&#13;
now let's look at the 15-year projection".                                 That was his&#13;
Achilles heel.          I am reluctant to say more, because he was&#13;
&#13;
a tremendous intellect.                  In many ways he was a kind man.                 I&#13;
&#13;
know not everybody shares this opinion.&#13;
&#13;
        He could see things.                    He had this bias towards the&#13;
&#13;
quantifiable.          But he was a very fair man. I was a member of&#13;
the Research Committee for donkey's years, probably spending&#13;
&#13;
the     longest       period,       as        long    as    it    existed,    from     the&#13;
beginning - then I was away - and after I came back. Hollis&#13;
&#13;
gave    his    opinion,       but        he    certainly did not             mind being&#13;
&#13;
outvoted.        That was a place where you could perfectly well&#13;
&#13;
say "no", or "what garbage", politely.                            He would not resent&#13;
&#13;
it.&#13;
Q:      But,     in     a     sense,           the     numbers       were     also     his&#13;
&#13;
contribution. He introduced a system where you could look at&#13;
the whole spectrum of developing countries in a comparative&#13;
&#13;
framework?&#13;
A:      I did not mean to say, by any means, this was garbage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                95&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 96&#13;
&#13;
  in all.         He also insisted that         there should be a country&#13;
&#13;
 framework,         so that at least you look at five countries in&#13;
&#13;
 something of a            comparable way,       and that      the data should&#13;
&#13;
 cover all the countries.               He did not pay much attention to&#13;
&#13;
 the quality of those data, and that was a problem, and some&#13;
&#13;
 of them were really heavy garbage.                 God knows that they are&#13;
&#13;
 still really heavy garbage now,                  but they were then even&#13;
&#13;
 garbagier than they are--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Was that his own doing?            Or was he to some extent also&#13;
&#13;
 reflecting McNamara's?&#13;
&#13;
 A:        I    think it's all of that.           It's both ways.         Clearly&#13;
&#13;
 McNamara chose him partly because he had this predilection.&#13;
&#13;
 Much of Hollis's independent work and studies earlier were&#13;
&#13;
 along          those    lines.   He    liked     it.     He    liked    to   have&#13;
&#13;
 estimates.             For his work,    you needed "gapfills" 72 and the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank became the gapfill manufacturer. Then somebody&#13;
&#13;
  looked at it,           and said ''Gee!       How interesting! all          these&#13;
&#13;
  data         correlate very closely" .         Well,   half    of     them were&#13;
&#13;
 gapfills, estimated in a way that correlated with the model.&#13;
&#13;
           Look,    obviously,    I    am a    sarcastic bastard,        and you&#13;
&#13;
  should try to give weight to that.                    His contribution was&#13;
&#13;
  really huge. You know what Bank economics were before him.&#13;
&#13;
  I was interviewed by the then Chief Economist of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      72&#13;
       Estimates made for the specific purpose of filling in&#13;
gaps in the data used for cross-country and time-series&#13;
analysis.&#13;
                                          96&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 97&#13;
&#13;
for my job, and I told him I was working on shadow prices,&#13;
&#13;
and he said,       "What is that?" and I thought he was trying to&#13;
&#13;
draw me out, pretending that he did not know, but I thought,&#13;
&#13;
of course, he knew.          But, no, he was not pretending.               He was&#13;
&#13;
perfectly       sincere.         And    all    the   rest.        So   Hollis   did&#13;
&#13;
tremendous things.          Brought in good people, all of that, and&#13;
&#13;
more.&#13;
&#13;
        But   he   had    this     defect,     and   I    don't    think   it   was&#13;
&#13;
catastrophic, but that was where I came in, in some sense,&#13;
&#13;
because I wanted to make these things better.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now--&#13;
&#13;
A:      Hollis     was      too        gullible      towards       numbers      and&#13;
&#13;
projections, and that was really his only significant defect&#13;
&#13;
that I    can think of.            I think going to Research Committee&#13;
&#13;
meetings under Hollis was a pleasure, because you had pretty&#13;
&#13;
high quality discussion.               Basically,        you had a     leader who&#13;
&#13;
knew his own mind, but who did not want to impose it on the&#13;
&#13;
others, and it was really quite something.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, when he decided to retire, I gather there was some&#13;
&#13;
idea of having Fishlaw come into the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I was not intimately involved in any of that.                        I know&#13;
&#13;
that some people said that Fishlaw had been asked--&#13;
&#13;
[END OF TAPE 1,          SIDE 1]&#13;
&#13;
By the time it came actually to make a choice, the middle-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          97&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 98&#13;
&#13;
of- the- road Republicans 73 under Reagan were in power,                            and&#13;
&#13;
basically they imposed a choice on the Bank.&#13;
Q:        But I suppose       Krueger's name had been on the list--&#13;
&#13;
A:        Oh,    Krueger's name was on any good list.                     What I was&#13;
&#13;
told by somebody who was closely involved in the selection&#13;
&#13;
process,        that the Bank was given a few names, by the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Treasury but coming from the House, saying "Unless you take&#13;
one of these, .. " and, the "one of these" were Blind Freddy,&#13;
Deaf Susan,        and Anne.         Now,        Anne would have been on any&#13;
&#13;
good list.          And I thought that she actually was a pretty&#13;
&#13;
good choice, considering the circumstances.&#13;
Q:        Now she represented a major shift from the Chenery--&#13;
A:        In    several    ways.      I     think   some   of     them were        more&#13;
&#13;
significative.            Well,     she   represented        a   major     shift     in&#13;
&#13;
personalities.            She could not abide many of the people whom&#13;
Chenery had left behind,                  she    liked some people who were&#13;
&#13;
good, and some who were not quite so likable.                            But, again,&#13;
&#13;
I had told her that I was not on her ideological side, and&#13;
she chose me, and I will be eternally grateful for that.&#13;
&#13;
          She brought in more trade-orientation,                       which I think&#13;
was good.         It is not that the Bank had, contrary to legend,&#13;
&#13;
ever       been     really        protectionist.           But     we     were     less&#13;
&#13;
systematically            trade-oriented.             Anne       had    basically     a&#13;
&#13;
systematic, free-trade orientation, but more in her general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     73   This is either a typo or meant as sarcasm.&#13;
                                            98&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 99&#13;
&#13;
digressions       than    when    it   actually         came   to    discussing   a&#13;
&#13;
country, where she perfectly realized there were political&#13;
&#13;
and other problems.&#13;
&#13;
     She was against what she called the "mindless number-&#13;
&#13;
mongering," not without reason; perhaps too optimistic about&#13;
&#13;
finding mindful number-mongering.                     We certainly tried, and&#13;
&#13;
in the end I do not think that we really succeeded.                           With&#13;
&#13;
hindsight, I feel we probably tried too much, and perhaps I&#13;
&#13;
should have shifted earlier into saying "Look,                        this cannot&#13;
&#13;
be done."      But       it   is difficult,           when you are under the&#13;
&#13;
pressure of circumstances, to realize that.&#13;
&#13;
     She obviously was very abrupt with people, and by the&#13;
&#13;
standards    of    previous       eras,        she    pushed people     out   with&#13;
&#13;
facility.     By the standard of succeeding eras, of course,&#13;
&#13;
she was incredibly soft-hearted about dealing with people,&#13;
&#13;
and I guess it all depends on how you, but--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   She pushed out--&#13;
&#13;
A:   She was really--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   --you mean "Hughes"?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.      Absolutely not.              Helen wanted         to   become Vice&#13;
&#13;
President, and barring that, she wanted to go home where she&#13;
&#13;
had a   wonderful        thing lined up,             which she had until       she&#13;
&#13;
retired,    when Ron Duncan went to take it.                    But there were&#13;
&#13;
others who suffered.             And she could be very cutting.                And&#13;
&#13;
she was not well surrounded.                   She had this extraordinarily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          99&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Baneth (1/12/95), Page 100&#13;
&#13;
  good private quality, which is a big public problem.                                  She&#13;
&#13;
  was        tremendously loyal        to her private            friends,       but    that&#13;
&#13;
  means that she tolerated some pretty funny shenanigans, and&#13;
&#13;
  some of them were very close to her,                     so you got a sort of&#13;
 mixture, you know. 74            And that didn't work out well.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:         But you managed to get on well with her?&#13;
 A:          I wouldn't say that, really.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:          Without becoming part of her private,--&#13;
&#13;
 A:          I certainly was not part of her private inner circle.&#13;
&#13;
  I had big problems with her.                   Partly she adopted somebody,&#13;
 who was a consultant, you know,                   Jed Schilling's, and then&#13;
  she        became     the   Data     Administrator.            Harrison        was     an&#13;
  absolutely            incredible     person,     but     she    was     adopted       by&#13;
&#13;
  Krueger, and that caused many problems.&#13;
&#13;
             No,   I    certainly did     not     become    part     of     her       inner&#13;
&#13;
  circle.           I   admired and I     admire her intellect.                   We had&#13;
  fights.          We had fights about appointments. I could not fill&#13;
 positions basically, because we had agreed at the beginning&#13;
&#13;
  that she certainly had veto power on my appointments, but&#13;
  she would not try to force down somebody in my throat.&#13;
             It worked pretty well, and it worked better as long as&#13;
&#13;
 Ram         Chopra     was   there,    because     he's    sort     of     a    rounded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        74&#13;
       A completely un-intelligible sentence has been deleted.&#13;
For the benefit of future historians with better cryptographic&#13;
equipment, it is here saved: "After all, who knows whether&#13;
they are Boris Yeltsin's or the General's army hubble-bubble&#13;
in Bosnia?".&#13;
&#13;
                                           100&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 101&#13;
&#13;
personality. To Enzo Grilli she took a tremendous dislike,&#13;
&#13;
and Enzo Grilli reciprocated it, and that made things more&#13;
&#13;
difficult.       I do not like people under me to get criticized&#13;
&#13;
except    through me,         so    that    did create difficulties.         I&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't say that it was all violets and roses.&#13;
&#13;
       But I enjoyed her.             She is a great intellect. She can&#13;
&#13;
be wrong like hell, but she admits it.                    That is rare.&#13;
&#13;
       To give you an example. We had gradually moved on to do&#13;
&#13;
the SAVEM tables.        It had started with a request by Ernie to&#13;
&#13;
his staff, but I heard about it, I believe, then they came&#13;
&#13;
to us for help.        We said we will do it.             And I used that, as&#13;
&#13;
I used a number of other outputs, to sort of mobilize staff&#13;
&#13;
and get good numbers, and so on.                  And   used those a lot. She&#13;
&#13;
attended many meetings. I don't remember the levels of the&#13;
&#13;
meeting, but there was one level where she went, there was&#13;
&#13;
a level I used to go. Then one day she took exception to&#13;
&#13;
something,     which not actually I,                but   somebody else,   had&#13;
&#13;
said. After that I had to leave, it was Michalopoulos's turn&#13;
&#13;
to represent the Vice-Presidency.&#13;
&#13;
       Anyway,       Anne was coming back from one meeting,                she&#13;
&#13;
said     "I   told     them        that    this    country's   currency    was&#13;
&#13;
appreciating,        and they told me it was devaluing,              and how&#13;
&#13;
come we show these numbers?"                    So we looked at our numbers&#13;
&#13;
and said that indeed they                 were devaluing.&#13;
&#13;
       Well, it turned out that she thought up was down, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          101&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 102&#13;
&#13;
  our tables showed up as up, and this is when the whole flap&#13;
&#13;
  started 75 â&#128;¢         Anne was absolutely set on "up is down", set on&#13;
&#13;
  her ways.         But when I showed her that the IMF did it our&#13;
&#13;
  way,    she said,        "Okay.    You know,        we are not going to go&#13;
&#13;
  against        the     IMF   on   this".      And     I     thought    that     was&#13;
&#13;
  extraordinarily          respectable,       because       very   few   people    do&#13;
&#13;
  that.    Most people just hold on to their ideas, particularly&#13;
&#13;
  if they have the power to impose them.                       So it was not a&#13;
&#13;
  cohabitation without problems,               but     it was okay.         We had&#13;
&#13;
 problems but it was okay.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:      Did she have a sort of major impact on the way the Bank&#13;
&#13;
  was looking at problems,            seeing problems?             After all,     she&#13;
&#13;
  was there when the debt crisis erupted,                      or she had come&#13;
&#13;
  shortly after.          Did she play a leading role in defining the&#13;
&#13;
  Bank's attitude in--?&#13;
&#13;
 A:       It   is      very difficult    to    say.     She had,     perhaps,      an&#13;
&#13;
  excessively critical view of the way the Bank's economists&#13;
&#13;
  looked at countries. She had a reasonably critical view of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     75&#13;
        Many economists, particularly those used to work in&#13;
Latin America say that an exchange rate is rising when it is&#13;
devalued, because there are then more (e.g.) pesos per dollar.&#13;
For many others, a devaluation, being a loss of value, must&#13;
mean the exchange rate is falling. Both ways of looking at&#13;
things were current at the Bank, sometimes in the same&#13;
document. My championship of uniformity met with tremendous&#13;
violent resistance (someone wrote that all who are used to&#13;
exchange rates naturally speak of it rising when there is a&#13;
devaluation) . It was in the course of this quarrel that I&#13;
named the two schools the up is up (a rise in value is a rise&#13;
in the exchange rate) and up is down (a rise in value is a&#13;
fall in the exchange rate) .&#13;
                                         102&#13;

&#13;
what was happening in countries.                    Yet also these were the&#13;
&#13;
years     when    we    were      promising     that    the      sun would      shine&#13;
&#13;
tomorrow,       and she went along with that.                         So I guess she&#13;
&#13;
learned that you can formulate your criticism up to a point,&#13;
&#13;
and not beyond, and the others learned to anticipate that.&#13;
&#13;
She thought of Ernie as a great ally in the meetings. I am&#13;
&#13;
not too sure in my mind that was really what he was,                              but&#13;
&#13;
they were satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
        She probably influenced lastingly, or contributed to,&#13;
&#13;
the free trade ethic.              It was by no means a new thing at the&#13;
&#13;
Bank,    but     she    certainly pushed         that       as    a    main   item of&#13;
&#13;
agenda, as a main touchstone, and that certainly went a long&#13;
&#13;
way.     By the same token, and perhaps in hindsight, perhaps&#13;
&#13;
we did not push enough the budget issues and some others.&#13;
&#13;
        She certainly contributed, not to the abandonment, but&#13;
&#13;
the lesser reliance on some of these funny projections.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did     she    have   a   major    impact      on   the       design of   the&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment programs?                 For instance, generically,&#13;
&#13;
and then also specifically.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well,    she had one generically through specifics.                         I&#13;
&#13;
think there was no vehicle for a generic impact.                              It came&#13;
&#13;
through these,          whatever they were called,                    loan committee&#13;
&#13;
meetings that she participated in, she got briefings and so&#13;
&#13;
on.     And I think she contributed. Again, you cannot say what&#13;
&#13;
would have happened without her, but she clearly contributed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          103&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 104&#13;
&#13;
to making trade policy what it became.&#13;
&#13;
        How much it actually happened in real life, who knows?&#13;
She was pragmatic. She would proclaim that any protectionism&#13;
&#13;
was nonsense and so on, in general, but she would not insist&#13;
on absolutely free trade for a country. Now,                       how much of&#13;
&#13;
that     can then be       left    for    the country?           My impression,&#13;
&#13;
superficially, is that in some cases we went too far, when&#13;
&#13;
the country was yielding;            in some cases we did not go far&#13;
enough; in some cases we went yo-yoing.&#13;
&#13;
        So how much actual policy change she contributed to?&#13;
&#13;
And     clearly     there    was    policy        change,    there     was    the&#13;
beginnings     of    the    privatization          sort     of    thing.      She&#13;
&#13;
contributed to all of these things, but that was also in the&#13;
&#13;
wind, as it were. How much of it was she?                   How much was the&#13;
&#13;
wind?     She did not give us in substance new intellectual&#13;
tools,     because     these       tools       existed.          She   certainly&#13;
&#13;
contributed to having them be disseminated in the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
perhaps not directly, so much, as by asking harsh questions&#13;
&#13;
at these Loan Committee meetings and before. That was the&#13;
easiest thing to do.              If the report was badly done,              that&#13;
&#13;
message got there, and it got used.&#13;
&#13;
        How much it contributed to actually modifying policies?&#13;
Well,    that's a big question.                You can ask throughout, you&#13;
&#13;
know.     I'm not sure.       I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Well, was she--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         104&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Baneth (1/12/95), Page 105&#13;
&#13;
A:      She    had bad relations                 with almost everybody except&#13;
&#13;
Ernie,      and      I       think Ernie had          just decided to have good&#13;
&#13;
relations         with         her    because    he    had   enough    trouble   with&#13;
&#13;
Moheen,       and I          don't know how much it went into substance.&#13;
&#13;
And she did have problems in management, to put it mildly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What was her relationship with Clausen?                       Did he sort of&#13;
&#13;
listen to her?                Was he--?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I   don' t       know .       My meetings with Clausen were by no&#13;
&#13;
means as frequent as they had been with McNamara. But I had&#13;
&#13;
gone to a few meetings.                  How much her impact was?         At one of&#13;
&#13;
the meetings             I     attended,        Krueger had proposed that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank,       with         the       central   policy      staff   leading,     should&#13;
&#13;
systematically evaluate structural adjustment prospects over&#13;
&#13;
the medium run, using a model, but not only a model.                             That&#13;
&#13;
was fiercely resisted by everybody who was not                              Krueger.&#13;
&#13;
That was one of the meetings in Clausen's office.                         But there&#13;
&#13;
were others I                had attended.&#13;
&#13;
        My impression, perhaps very partial, was that it was&#13;
&#13;
rather a kindergarten sort of fighting, with the teacher not&#13;
&#13;
wanting to get                 involved in the fight             so they went on&#13;
&#13;
fighting.          Now,        I   was told "It is not that he doesn't want&#13;
&#13;
to get involved.                   This is how he formulates his opinion.          So&#13;
&#13;
he lets them fight, and then he makes up his mind."                         Anyway,&#13;
&#13;
Clausen didn't say, "Oh, well, , this is a wonderful piece.&#13;
&#13;
Who doesn't agree?"                    Not at all.       Everybody was attacking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             105&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 106&#13;
&#13;
everyone,        and   it     was   really pretty           low stuff.          It    was&#13;
incredible, the Senior Vice Presidents and other high level&#13;
people fighting.&#13;
&#13;
     Anyway,    I think she felt her voice was heard adequately.&#13;
&#13;
She had no illusion that all that she wanted happened, but&#13;
&#13;
she    felt     that    she    had an      adequate      voice      in the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
councils. That is why she left when Conable took her out of&#13;
the Managing Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You     mentioned      Clausen.           Do   you   have    any       sort       of&#13;
recollections          of   Clausen       and    how   he    hit    the   Bank       and,&#13;
especially following the McNamara period?&#13;
&#13;
A:      It     is very difficult,           again,     because      he    came       at    a&#13;
&#13;
difficult period.             Also because my understanding of Clausen&#13;
&#13;
is clearly colored by the fact that, after the World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
he went back to the bloody Bank of America and pulled it out&#13;
of    the mire.         So he clearly was not at the end of his&#13;
&#13;
tether.&#13;
        Clausen came at a bad time.                Clausen complained, not to&#13;
&#13;
me,    but to somebody else at some point,                     "Look, here I've&#13;
&#13;
been for a number of months, the U.S. has not yet put in an&#13;
Executive        Director,      and   I    haven't been able              to    get       an&#13;
&#13;
appointment with Regan yet".                    Not Reagan, yes, Regan.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Regan.&#13;
A:      Donald Regan.         So, he came at a time when the guns were&#13;
out against the World Bank, when McNamara had negotiated an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           106&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 107&#13;
&#13;
  IDA agreement which was basically killed. This was the first&#13;
&#13;
  time      not    only   Congress      would   not    give    the    money,    the&#13;
&#13;
  Administration did not want it.                  The American Congress was&#13;
&#13;
  wondering whether they wanted the World Bank at all. Clausen&#13;
&#13;
  came in, and his Vice President for Latin America told him&#13;
&#13;
  everything was upsy-daisy,              let's go off to Toronto hand in&#13;
&#13;
  hand,      and there we will tell you how wonderful things are&#13;
&#13;
  happening.        And then he reads, practically in the newspaper,&#13;
&#13;
  that Mexico had just gone into a crisis.&#13;
&#13;
            So he came at a bad time.               He did not have a good&#13;
&#13;
  control and perhaps he did not want to have a good control&#13;
&#13;
  of    this      thing which he        inherited.      That   I     can't   really&#13;
&#13;
  judge.         He may not have wanted to make a change, why would&#13;
&#13;
  he, he may not have wanted simply to impose his will.&#13;
&#13;
            He   wasn't   that   bad.      There     were   things    which were&#13;
&#13;
  clearly erroneous. Another occasion when I went there - I&#13;
&#13;
  did not open my mouth that evening - I had convinced                         Anne&#13;
&#13;
  to argue that these financial profits which the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
  boasting about were all phony. Because we had taken on this&#13;
&#13;
  huge foreign exchange risk, which we had been shoving on to&#13;
&#13;
  the developing countries.               It did not go anywhere,            and we&#13;
&#13;
  continued doing that 76 until the very last moment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       76&#13;
      Borrowing Yens and European currencies when the dollar&#13;
was riding high, and in effect converting the proceeds into&#13;
dollars, which brought us higher interest rates. So the Bank&#13;
could boast of its wonderful financial management, and did it&#13;
not do just that! And when the dollar, quite predictably, fell&#13;
&#13;
                                          107&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Baneth (1/12/95), Page 108&#13;
&#13;
       We clearly thought in EPD that the debt crisis was much&#13;
&#13;
  worse than was put out.            It was clear, not just to me, to&#13;
&#13;
  many other people looking at it, that resolving the crisis&#13;
&#13;
  was at the heart of the Bank's work.                    But there was no&#13;
  vehicle provided for putting out a policy message from EPD.&#13;
&#13;
       Anne's analyses were in some sense correct, but too far&#13;
&#13;
 pushed.    It is true that everybody can always pull himself&#13;
&#13;
  off any problem if his policies are all right.                   But it is&#13;
&#13;
  bloody difficult to get your policies all right, with all&#13;
&#13;
  the things that were happening.             Our    [EPD's]     message was&#13;
&#13;
  that more radical debt relief was necessary, and she never&#13;
&#13;
  stopped it,     let me      say that,     even when the        French were&#13;
&#13;
 pressuring us.        Anne then told me that she got the message,&#13;
&#13;
  and she was almost embarrassed asking whether we might not&#13;
&#13;
  find a way of wording it which did not betray our thoughts,&#13;
&#13;
  but would satisfy the French.&#13;
&#13;
       I    do   not   know   how    vigorously     she    transmitted   the&#13;
&#13;
 message.    Ourselves,       we did not     formulate      it   vigorously,&#13;
&#13;
 partly because it was not really my mandate to be looking at&#13;
&#13;
  these things, and they all came in the periphery of our work&#13;
&#13;
  through the     Preface of        this publication,       the World Debt&#13;
&#13;
  Tables.    Our mandate was data, it was not analysis. I wanted&#13;
&#13;
  analysis, but much of that was in other departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
after peaking in 1985, our borrowers in effect had to pay for&#13;
the resulting loss.&#13;
                                      108&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 109&#13;
&#13;
        I do not know how much of that went through, I do not&#13;
&#13;
know how much Clausen got.                  I   know that the message he got&#13;
from the others was not all that sharp.                      But I don't really&#13;
&#13;
know.        I    don't know how much he intervened to get the Baker&#13;
&#13;
plan,       that speech.         My impression, not knowledge,             is that&#13;
&#13;
his relations with Baker were not good,                       that in fact he,&#13;
&#13;
Clausen, wanted to be renominated, but could not get a word&#13;
&#13;
out of Baker in that regard.                      So finally Clausen decided,&#13;
&#13;
"well, I want to be master of my fate.                       I cannot very well&#13;
&#13;
go up on the podium and say I am staying because I don't&#13;
&#13;
know i f they'll renominate me, so I'll go up on the podium&#13;
&#13;
and say I am leaving".                  Which is pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
        I    do not think he was out of his depth intellectually,&#13;
&#13;
but he may well have been out of his depth in a management&#13;
&#13;
sense.            There was      this    huge organization with inherited&#13;
&#13;
upper structure,             which he did not modify all that much.&#13;
&#13;
Benjenk and company, yes, but basically Ernie and Qureshi he&#13;
&#13;
kept.            Ernie,   Qureshi,      Joe Wood and company,           those were&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's last will and testament, promoted, sort of, the&#13;
&#13;
day     he       left,    that   was     when     the   announcements    on   their&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities came out. Clausen did not touch that very&#13;
&#13;
much.            He was keen on getting on with the staff.                     It's&#13;
&#13;
amazing when you think back. Here is this private banker, he&#13;
&#13;
is the one who basically restored first class travel, you&#13;
&#13;
remember; he is the one who made a big thing out of the 20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            109&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Baneth (1/12/95), Page 110&#13;
&#13;
and 30-year ceremonies, which under McNamara were, sort of,&#13;
&#13;
having         your picture         taken with   the   picture    before   the&#13;
&#13;
picture had been taken, you remember, and sort of saying "90&#13;
&#13;
people    in     60    seconds,     this is   the record,    but we'll      do&#13;
&#13;
better next           time".    And now Clausen        took all    that very&#13;
&#13;
seriously.&#13;
&#13;
        I think he will come to be appreciated as the man who&#13;
&#13;
saved the Bank, at a time when it was not evident that it&#13;
&#13;
would be saved.          I do not think he could have done very much&#13;
&#13;
more.     I also think, perhaps he was reluctant to shake up&#13;
&#13;
inside, maybe he thought this would be for his second term.&#13;
&#13;
Not that necessarily a shake-up was needed in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
people,        but    perhaps   a    different   message.        Coordination&#13;
&#13;
between the Senior Vice Presidencies - that perhaps was his&#13;
&#13;
fault, that he did not realize that we are not like separate&#13;
&#13;
profit centers, that we really have to live together, and my&#13;
&#13;
impression from these few meetings where I had been was that&#13;
&#13;
this worked extraordinarily badly at that level.                     I don't&#13;
&#13;
know how it worked in informal meetings or otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But isn't it also that managing the Bank in a sense is&#13;
&#13;
an intellectual challenge?              You have to be articulate, you&#13;
&#13;
have to be able to--&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      --not only understand what different people are saying&#13;
&#13;
but synthesize what they do,              and formulate what you think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        110&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Baneth (1/12/95), Page 111&#13;
&#13;
they mean and what, and add your own input to this.                   Now, he&#13;
&#13;
was notorious for his inability to articulate--&#13;
&#13;
A:   That's     true.      I     don't    even    know   if    he   wanted   to&#13;
&#13;
articulate.     But     again,     I'm    not    sure    whether    the   most&#13;
&#13;
articulate man in those days could have articulated much.&#13;
&#13;
As I said, McNamara was articulating a message which by then&#13;
&#13;
got quite out of kilter.          If the Prophet is saying, "People,&#13;
let us revolt and let us overthrow the tyranny," when there&#13;
&#13;
is a lot of discontent and the people have some weapons and&#13;
&#13;
so on,   that is wonderful.              When everybody is sitting at&#13;
lunch, happily stuffing themselves, and nobody is listening,&#13;
and anyway they do not even speak the language,                       then to&#13;
&#13;
proclaim that, it's just ridiculous.&#13;
&#13;
     When     Clausen came, what message could there have been?&#13;
&#13;
That we don't honestly need the World Bank,                     as the wise&#13;
&#13;
people   in    the    Reagan     Administration         were   saying?    That&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't have been terribly stimulating.&#13;
     Yes,     he could have, with hindsight, given a stronger&#13;
&#13;
message about the debt problem.                 But even of that, I'm not&#13;
&#13;
sure. First of all, the Bank had to be different to give him&#13;
the message.     We should have sat down and said, "Okay, let's&#13;
&#13;
do a real serious analysis of all                 this, no holds barred.&#13;
&#13;
Let us see where we can go".              Then, let us decide what the&#13;
&#13;
message can be,         considering that we cannot give out the&#13;
&#13;
message that commercial banks are going to lose money on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     111&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 112&#13;
&#13;
this.    There were many other things that should have been&#13;
discussed more.&#13;
&#13;
        There is a one percent probability that actually all&#13;
these things did appeal to Clausen, and he was speaking to&#13;
&#13;
the Ministers so confidentially that we never heard about&#13;
&#13;
it.     I don't think so.             I think, in fact, he never really&#13;
&#13;
thought       it through,       but it was not his problem only,              to&#13;
think it through.             The message did not get to him.&#13;
&#13;
        He     probably       could   not    have   articulated    leadership,&#13;
because it went against the then wishes of his greatest&#13;
&#13;
shareholder.           Maybe he could have come into his own after&#13;
&#13;
the Baker initiative, but then he was out.&#13;
Q:      I guess one of the major issues was to what extent and&#13;
&#13;
I guess the position of the U.S. for a long time was that&#13;
&#13;
the sort of debt problem was a question of liquidity --&#13;
A:      Yes.     But not just the U.S.            Everybody.   I mean, every,&#13;
&#13;
everybody--&#13;
Q:      --whereas the Bank, I suppose, fairly early on came to&#13;
the conclusion,           that this was structural and that it was&#13;
&#13;
really reflecting some of the distortions                      that had been&#13;
&#13;
there all along and that needed to be dealt with.                     Now--&#13;
A:      I don't think this is a contrast.                  If you wanted to&#13;
&#13;
summarize        the    way    the    Reagan      Administration   would   say,&#13;
&#13;
"well,       this is over-borrowing,              it is a liquidity problem&#13;
brought about by socialist borrowing," and the Bank would,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            112&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 113&#13;
&#13;
  especially, I think, the--&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        No.    But there were terms of trade and all these things&#13;
&#13;
 that kind of people blamed for the--&#13;
&#13;
 A:        No.    Look, from the beginning or even before the debt&#13;
&#13;
 crisis,         the    Bank   was   saying,      lots    of   countries     needed&#13;
&#13;
 structural            adjustment.    The     whole      structural   adjustment&#13;
&#13;
  lending was invented well before the debt crisis actually&#13;
&#13;
 struck.         I think the U.S. would have wanted not to lend. The&#13;
&#13;
 U.S. desire to lend or whatever came essentially out of the&#13;
&#13;
 wish to save the private banks,                   to save its own banking.&#13;
&#13;
 Even Regan realized that you could not just let Mexico go.&#13;
&#13;
 Even Regan came through with the BIS to give a bridge                        loan&#13;
&#13;
 to Mexico.            But we are not getting any older either,                 you&#13;
&#13;
 know.       It reminds you of things 77 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank probably realized that there was no way out of&#13;
&#13;
 this without doing good policies.                    On the     other hand,     it&#13;
&#13;
 refused to say that there was no way out of this either, if&#13;
&#13;
 you did not somehow lighten the debt burden significantly,&#13;
&#13;
 not just roll it over for a little while.                     And that remained&#13;
&#13;
 highly contentious, until well into '87. In '87, we had this&#13;
&#13;
 Debt      Task    Force which was opposed,               even the    task    force&#13;
&#13;
  itself,        and its conclusions,         they were opposed tooth and&#13;
&#13;
 nail by both Finance and Operations, whose VPs by then had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      77&#13;
       At the time of this conversation, the US was again&#13;
scrambling to fix up a bridge loan to Mexico, which was going&#13;
through another financial crisis.&#13;
                                            113&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Baneth (1/12/95), Page 114&#13;
&#13;
swapped.        And all it said,         really,    was that in some cases&#13;
&#13;
you have to lighten the debt burden, otherwise the countries&#13;
&#13;
cannot return to normal creditworthiness, which by now seems&#13;
&#13;
ridiculously conservative.               I re-read some of these things,&#13;
&#13;
and        thought,   oh,   my    God,     how     could   I    have   been   so&#13;
&#13;
conservative?         And then I see the scribble on it, by Ernie,&#13;
&#13;
"this is ridiculous, nonsense."&#13;
           So the difference was not really that big between the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and U.S. interests.            Of course, we did think that more&#13;
&#13;
money was needed.           But my impression, my recollection,               is&#13;
&#13;
that       after the debt        crisis the      U.S.   was    basically in a&#13;
&#13;
totally illogical position in the sense that after the debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis, Regan was all for World Bank lending too.                      He just&#13;
&#13;
was not for a World Bank capital increase.                      And the Baker&#13;
&#13;
revolution was "let's do what we have been doing before,&#13;
&#13;
only do it better".         And this time, he said that if and when&#13;
&#13;
needed, the World Bank will get its capital increase".&#13;
&#13;
           I do not think that the analysis changed.               Krueger was&#13;
&#13;
very close to many people in Congress and the Republican&#13;
&#13;
Party,       and her interests on some trade policy issues were&#13;
&#13;
certainly well in line with what these guys were saying, and&#13;
&#13;
with their position that real wages were too high,                        labor&#13;
&#13;
market rigidities and so on.&#13;
           I don't remember what the question was 78 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      78&#13;
           That is what comes when you ramble on!&#13;
&#13;
                                         114&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Baneth (1/12/95), Page 115&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Well,       the     question        was        to    what       extent,          a     more&#13;
&#13;
articulate Clausen could have had a stronger impact on the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. and the way the U.S. looked at the whole situation and&#13;
&#13;
the role of the Bank in--&#13;
&#13;
A:      I     don't      know.         These     are    difficult         years.             Jimmy&#13;
&#13;
Carter's        gift      to     the    Bank     was    that       he    chose       a       fairly&#13;
&#13;
conservative Republican as President, because if he had been&#13;
&#13;
a Democrat, it is not that he wouldn't have survived, but we&#13;
&#13;
would not have gotten a penny, the U.S. would basically have&#13;
&#13;
blocked completely the Bank's functions, which it did to a&#13;
&#13;
considerable extent.               Remember the reduction of IDA, and all&#13;
&#13;
that.         To    convince       Regan,       that    was       above   most       people's&#13;
&#13;
powers.            Get    along        better    with       the    Congress?         Perhaps;&#13;
&#13;
Conable certainly did that, for a different reason.&#13;
&#13;
        It was difficult.               The problem of the debt crisis, once&#13;
&#13;
it had hit, perhaps even before that, was that articulating&#13;
&#13;
your vision in public could cause the realization of what&#13;
&#13;
you thought was inevitable.                     Basically, our strategy was to&#13;
&#13;
get     the    banks      to     refinance,           saying      it    was    a     liquidity&#13;
&#13;
crisis,       so they refinance and we help a little.                                They did&#13;
&#13;
not refinance sufficiently,                      so we helped a               lot,       but not&#13;
&#13;
enough to prevent a major decline in inflows. Basically we&#13;
&#13;
gave more than foreseen,                  the banks less, and the countries&#13;
&#13;
got a lot less than they needed, to simplify it.&#13;
&#13;
        But if we had come out and said, "This is a joke, these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                llS&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Baneth (1/12/95), Page 116&#13;
&#13;
loans will never actually be repaid completely",                      it would&#13;
&#13;
have    been     even    worse.      So     it   was    very   difficult      to&#13;
&#13;
articulate a vision on that.&#13;
&#13;
        He   did articulate        something,       which    in my view was&#13;
&#13;
rather interesting.         The Tokyo speech,           you remember?        The&#13;
&#13;
Tokyo speech had been written by Javed Burki, and delivered&#13;
&#13;
in Tokyo.      It was before the '82 crisis. It said, basically,&#13;
&#13;
that for many developing countries, middle income, what now&#13;
&#13;
counts is private flows,           that they were out of the woods,&#13;
&#13;
the developing world was no longer a single one.                     He did not&#13;
&#13;
go quite so far as to say that development problems are now&#13;
&#13;
resolved, but it was a very optimistic vision; except for a&#13;
&#13;
few countries at the bottom, too optimistic.                   And I guess it&#13;
&#13;
shook him up, I.G.,        (or was it Manmohan Singh? I don't know&#13;
&#13;
recall) told him very shortly thereafter, as they were back&#13;
&#13;
from    Tokyo,     at    dinner,    that     this      was   close    to   being&#13;
&#13;
unfriendly.       I mean, they did not think it was like that at&#13;
&#13;
all.    And then it turned out that the speech had not really&#13;
&#13;
been very well          cleared or discussed           in the Bank and so&#13;
&#13;
forth, and did contain.            Anyway--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      This was the speech he gave in Tokyo at the--?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I don't remember the occasion.              It must have been some&#13;
&#13;
big meeting, but I don't remember what the occasion was.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And it was before the debt crisis, this was his first&#13;
&#13;
year?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      116&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Baneth (1/12/95), Page 117&#13;
&#13;
A:      I'm pretty sure it was his first year,                      yes.     And I&#13;
&#13;
remember it contained some wonderful pronouncement about how&#13;
&#13;
much transfer from labor income and so on there will be, in&#13;
&#13;
the private sector.          And some of this he described. Maybe he&#13;
&#13;
thought of making a few big speeches, but somehow did not&#13;
&#13;
think that the mechanism that McNamara had used,                            worked.&#13;
&#13;
Also, he was indeed not very good at articulating.                          Perhaps&#13;
&#13;
he was afraid that too much had been articulated before.&#13;
&#13;
        He was not a fool.           He was also a man of culture, and&#13;
&#13;
knew a lot of world leaders. Practically the first letter he&#13;
&#13;
got,    even before he arrived, was from the Bulgarians, who&#13;
&#13;
were not Bank members,               and were    saying      "As we        told you&#13;
&#13;
during        your   last   visit,     we    think    that    the    World     Bank&#13;
&#13;
overestimates our per capita GNP" .                  I happen to know about&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
        Maybe he was not a shining leader, but I don't know&#13;
&#13;
that many people could have done much better at the time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, he left in '86, and Conable came to replace him,&#13;
&#13;
and Conable then, of course, no sooner did he arrive at the&#13;
&#13;
Bank,    initiated the '87 reorganization of the Bank.                         This&#13;
&#13;
all still found you in the same place--&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah.&#13;
Q:      --and, for the moment, also still working for the same&#13;
&#13;
person, but although Stanley Fischer then--&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.      First   it was       Krueger,   then        decided to leave&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       117&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Baneth (1/12/95), Page 118&#13;
&#13;
because     she    was    no   longer           Conable         suppressed   the&#13;
managing committee, and basically it meant that                       Anne had&#13;
&#13;
less influence, and I guess Conable--&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This was after the reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. This was as soon as Conable came in, and it was a&#13;
&#13;
mini-reorganization.           He suppressed the Managing Committee,&#13;
&#13;
said "there is no Managing Corrunittee."                I do not remember&#13;
the exact terms, but you can find that.                 Clausen had shaken&#13;
up the Bank by making a Managing Committee,                        and in fact&#13;
&#13;
there were questions in the Board,               "What is this Managing&#13;
&#13;
Committee?        There is nothing in the statute."                But Conable&#13;
&#13;
stopped it.       And he decided that access to him would be only&#13;
through the two Senior Vice Presidents, and then Shihata and&#13;
&#13;
Thahane separately pointed out that would not do, because&#13;
&#13;
they had statutory duties and so on, so they too got direct&#13;
access.     But Anne never got that.             I guess it was partly&#13;
&#13;
because     Conable      may   not   have    liked    her   because     of   her&#13;
language.     I think it was that Conable arrived not liking&#13;
&#13;
her.   She was too right-wing for him, which is in a sense&#13;
funny because we got along.                 We had a lot of fights,          We&#13;
&#13;
always had little fights.               You name it,        I    had a lot of&#13;
fights with her, but not over ideology.                     It was on other&#13;
&#13;
things.&#13;
       But I guess Conable wanted to beef up his relations&#13;
with the Democrats in the Congress.                  He knew that with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      118&#13;

&#13;
Administration he     had       then,   it     was   very different     from&#13;
&#13;
Clausen.    When he wanted to see Baker, he saw Baker.                And so&#13;
&#13;
he was not unhappy to let her go, to see her go, to put it&#13;
&#13;
mildly.&#13;
&#13;
     Then she was not replaced immediately.                   There was an&#13;
&#13;
interim with Ben King. Ingram and I had gone to whoever was&#13;
&#13;
in charge, Bill Paijmans, no, Bill Cosgrove, whoever.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He was the personnel man, yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.    And said something to the effect that we did not&#13;
&#13;
think that Michalopoulos would make a good successor, even&#13;
&#13;
interim, and that either Greg or I would do, but preferably&#13;
&#13;
they get somebody retired from the outside,                   somebody like&#13;
&#13;
Ben King. Because by that time the, the reorganization was&#13;
&#13;
in the air. We thought that either of us, either Ingram or&#13;
&#13;
I, would do, but the best might be an interim solution, and&#13;
&#13;
that was what they did.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Ingram was your counterpart in the other Department?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.    He had less fights with Anne,               but he had more&#13;
&#13;
changes to his Department, and Anne just replaced, or took&#13;
&#13;
away his Division Chiefs, which she did not do to me, but we&#13;
&#13;
did have a lot of fights about it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He succeeded Chopra or--?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No. Ingram succeeded Stoutjesdijk, who was the Head of&#13;
&#13;
that Research Department. Then Anne wanted to change some&#13;
&#13;
Division    Chiefs,   so   he    went     to    Ernie   who   found   him   a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    119&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Baneth (1/12/95), Page 120&#13;
&#13;
Department, and so he was gone.                That was very much at the&#13;
beginning of Anne's stay.            In fact, probably before even I&#13;
&#13;
became Director, but I am not sure 79 â&#128;¢                I think so.    So it&#13;
&#13;
was very much at the beginning of Anne's stay.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         Now Stanley Fischer comes. What did that mean?&#13;
&#13;
A:         It was a very difficult period.          This was right after&#13;
&#13;
the reorganization.           They were still organizing, but I was&#13;
&#13;
IEC Director and so on.          Ben King had walked out, because he&#13;
&#13;
thought that the reorganization was a shabby thing.                   I was&#13;
&#13;
shown a short-list, on which I thought Stanley Fischer was&#13;
&#13;
the best person.           However, I said that I could think of lots&#13;
&#13;
of others who were not on the short list, like Bela Balassa,&#13;
&#13;
poor thing,       whom I would have liked to get that position,&#13;
&#13;
who        would have been a lot better .... But anyway., Fischer&#13;
&#13;
came in.&#13;
            In many cases I know why things go wrong with people,&#13;
&#13;
they       disagree   on    substance.     I    have   a   tendency   to   be&#13;
&#13;
somewhat sarcastic.            People often don't like that.           With&#13;
&#13;
Fischer I really don't know.             What did he do in substance?&#13;
&#13;
not very much in the beginning.            There was nothing he really&#13;
&#13;
wanted to modify much.             He did not come in with a clear&#13;
&#13;
agenda, like Anne did, and less than what Helen Hughes had.&#13;
&#13;
He probably wanted somewhat less modeling and so on,                       and&#13;
&#13;
then he wanted more research on trade, but it was not very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      79   Yes - before I became Director of EPD.&#13;
&#13;
                                     120&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Baneth (1/12/95), Page 121&#13;
&#13;
clearly transmitted.          He clearly had ideas.           One of the&#13;
reasons I thought he was a good candidate is that his views&#13;
on debt were very similar to what I have had.&#13;
&#13;
        The way it went was very funny.                Hopper,   when the&#13;
reorganization was still in full swing, he asked John Holsen&#13;
&#13;
and myself what we thought was the biggest problem.                We said&#13;
&#13;
debt.     So he asked for a memorandum.          I wrote it.      We had a&#13;
discussion.      He brought it to Conable.             And then Conable&#13;
&#13;
called    a   meeting   of    whatever    it   was,    the   Senior   Vice&#13;
Presidents and whoever were around him, a very few people;&#13;
&#13;
basically it was the Senior Vice Presidents and Hopper and&#13;
&#13;
a couple of their henchmen. And Conable accepted the idea,&#13;
&#13;
but the others thought that everything was fine, or if it is&#13;
&#13;
not fine it will be fine in a while.                  But it was a very&#13;
&#13;
curious discussion, because I had difficulty believing that,&#13;
&#13;
intellectually,     either Ernie or Qureshi could think that&#13;
things were really going so well with the Baker initiative,&#13;
&#13;
by '87.       And they certainly did not want any study,               but&#13;
&#13;
somehow Conable accepted that there should be a study, with&#13;
me   as    chairman,    but   every     Senior   vice-Presidency       was&#13;
represented.     There was D.     C.   Rao from Stern's,         there was&#13;
David Bock from wherever he was then, under Qureshi on Co-&#13;
&#13;
financing, and there were a couple of other people.                I don't&#13;
&#13;
remember them all.       A pretty small group.          And we had--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Was Mistry on--?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  121&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Baneth (1/12/95), Page 122&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   Percy Mistry had left already to manage the family&#13;
fortune.    He had gone well before then, a couple of years&#13;
before at least.&#13;
&#13;
     And   funnily,   despite    the    presence   of   all   these&#13;
&#13;
subordinates of people who said that everything was okay, we&#13;
&#13;
came out with a unanimous report, which obviously did not go&#13;
&#13;
as far as I wanted, but which did say there was a solvency&#13;
&#13;
problem, and in many cases the debt will have to be reduced.&#13;
&#13;
It wasn't the best of papers. I thought it went pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
So did David Hopper, who wanted to see it and discuss it&#13;
&#13;
with Rajagopalan and I     guess Cola.;o,    a restricted group,&#13;
&#13;
just before it went to the Managing Committee. What was it&#13;
&#13;
called?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Policy Review--&#13;
&#13;
A:   Whatever, this managing council, President's whatever.&#13;
&#13;
Hopper thought, this makes a key point. I had seen Conable&#13;
&#13;
a couple of times,    to brief him on progress, on        what we&#13;
&#13;
thought,   and he seemed to understand.        And by that time&#13;
&#13;
Fischer had arrived, then there was the pubic discussion on&#13;
&#13;
the 3rd of January, and I felt very let down. It was a big&#13;
&#13;
meeting, I was a small boy there, and it seemed to me that&#13;
&#13;
my bosses did not take this anywhere.         It was agreed that&#13;
&#13;
deep thoughts will continue to be thought in the Development&#13;
&#13;
Policy Staff, but the real job will be done by the big boys,&#13;
&#13;
Operations and Finance. And I guess this did not start me&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                122&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Baneth (1/12/95), Page 123&#13;
&#13;
  very happy with my brand-new supervisor.&#13;
&#13;
          I did not get from Fischer the sense of any particular&#13;
&#13;
  agenda, unlike Anne Krueger, who clearly had one, and in a&#13;
&#13;
  different    way    so   had   Chenery.      I   had an    impression of&#13;
&#13;
  somewhat distant relations, which is difficult when you are&#13;
&#13;
  a Director.     Even before he arrived, Hopper was doing his&#13;
&#13;
  budget every which way.           He had told me that           I       would be&#13;
&#13;
 Acting V.P., but then budget decisions were done by Fischer,&#13;
&#13;
 between,     and during his visits,           and they made bloody no&#13;
&#13;
  sense. He gave up so much of our resources,                 that he made&#13;
&#13;
  things difficult.          Anyway,   I thought,    or I had a feeling,&#13;
&#13;
  that    something    was    not   altogether      well,   but       I    had    no&#13;
&#13;
 particular indications.&#13;
&#13;
          I guess I did something stupid at some point. We wrote&#13;
&#13;
  a speech for Shihata, which I thought we should not have had&#13;
&#13;
  to write and I had protested, but had agreed.               I was also a&#13;
&#13;
  little upset because Fischer had sent Ramesh Chander over to&#13;
&#13;
  discuss    with Shihata what         he    wanted in his     speech.           The&#13;
&#13;
  report I got was totally unintelligible, and I did not know&#13;
&#13;
  what the hell Shihata wanted, and I had to call up Shihata&#13;
&#13;
  to ask him what he wanted;            and he said,        "But I         already&#13;
&#13;
  explained for about an hour to Ramesh Chander. "                         Then I&#13;
&#13;
  hired somebody who wrote the speech 80 â&#128;¢            Fischer knew we did&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     80A young French woman whose name I do not remember; she&#13;
did very well, but of course needed quite a bit of guidance&#13;
from me.&#13;
                                       123&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Baneth (1/12/95), Page 124&#13;
&#13;
  the        speech,       that we wrote            it    from A to Z.           Then,    when&#13;
  Shihata        sent          it    out    for    comments,     Fischer       commented on&#13;
&#13;
  something, "This is not so, and what it should say is this"&#13;
  And I rather foolishly wrote to Shihata saying, "Mr. Fischer&#13;
&#13;
  must        have had a              lapsus      calami"--      (I'll    explain:   lapsus&#13;
  linguae,           a    more       common    expression,       means     a   slip of     the&#13;
&#13;
  tongue; lapsus calami is a slip of the pen, an involuntary&#13;
&#13;
  mistake in writing]; "what he wrote is nonsense"                                (though I&#13;
&#13;
  used less sharp language, that is what it meant). I did it&#13;
&#13;
  because        I       was        upset   with    Fischer,      because,      instead     of&#13;
  telling me first that he did not                            agree with something he&#13;
  knew I had written, he wrote it to Shihata. So I reaffirmed&#13;
&#13;
  our position,                 also directly to Shihata; but I should not&#13;
&#13;
  have done it.&#13;
             Some        time       after   that,     I   went    to     see   Fischer,     we&#13;
  discussed management. The problem was the same as with Anne&#13;
&#13;
  Krueger; Fischer was trying to direct people and intervene&#13;
  with them directly; and I did not know what the hell was&#13;
&#13;
  going on, which is something I strongly objected to.                                   But I&#13;
&#13;
  also asked him what problems he had with me.                                  He said, no&#13;
&#13;
  problem,           except that,           maybe,       you insist too much on the&#13;
  budget constraint.                   I said okay, I will try to change that.&#13;
             And then I went away and when I                        came back",      Hopper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        81&#13;
       I had been away in France for almost a month, to give&#13;
my courses at Clermont-Ferrand and to vote in the Presidential&#13;
elections. I returned to the office on 31 May 1988, and Hopper&#13;
                                                    124&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 125&#13;
&#13;
 told me that Fischer wanted me to go.                     And then I put up a&#13;
 fight       for about a year.         I   went after a year,              and under&#13;
&#13;
 rather better conditions than those which were outlined at&#13;
&#13;
 the beginning.            I did reject an advisor position here in&#13;
 washington, even though I realized that if you accept those,&#13;
&#13;
 sometimes other things appear.                  I realized that even then,&#13;
&#13;
 but I did not want anything of the sort.&#13;
         I    had    got     along    with       Hopper      fine.     During     the&#13;
&#13;
 reorganization, one of the reorganization proposals had been&#13;
&#13;
 a suppression of the Systems Division.                    If you looked at the&#13;
&#13;
 charts, you found that the Systems people went to the other&#13;
&#13;
 Departments.        I   thought     that was       nonsense.        We discussed&#13;
&#13;
 adaptations        to     the    reorganization        proposals,     and Hopper&#13;
 agreed, and then he went to Conable, and then the wise men&#13;
&#13;
 came,       and the wise men said,              "No.     The Systems Division&#13;
&#13;
 remains suppressed."&#13;
         By the way,        I had fused two other Divisions, so I was&#13;
&#13;
 not proposing to increase the number of Division Chiefs.                           I&#13;
&#13;
 realized that one should not do that, and I did not increase&#13;
&#13;
 the number of Division chiefs.&#13;
         When Hopper told me that the reorganization gurus had&#13;
&#13;
 refused       to   keep    the    Systems       Division,    it     was   a   Friday&#13;
&#13;
  evening and I just told Hopper "I am taking a very serious&#13;
  view of this."           And I went home,         and we sat down with my&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
called me in that very morning.&#13;
                                           125&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Baneth (1/12/95), Page 126&#13;
&#13;
wife,    and we started calculating,      can we survive and find&#13;
&#13;
another job,    or survive even without another job?          And I&#13;
&#13;
decided that I     could.   So I    wrote on my home computer a&#13;
&#13;
little memorandum telling Hopper that under these conditions&#13;
&#13;
I   cannot work, and that I   considered that my position does&#13;
&#13;
not exist.     But when I   came into the office and I      printed&#13;
&#13;
this out, my telephone rings and it is Hopper.           He says "I&#13;
&#13;
gave this a great deal of thought, and I went to Conable and&#13;
&#13;
told him that if I am responsible,          Baneth should get the&#13;
&#13;
organizational    structure he needs".         I   appreciated that&#13;
&#13;
greatly.&#13;
        However, coming back to Fischer, I don't know what had&#13;
&#13;
happened.     Fischer clearly wanted to work on debt, and I can&#13;
&#13;
understand that he wanted to work on debt, and - to put the&#13;
&#13;
worst possible light on it          -   that he wanted to get the&#13;
&#13;
glory to himself.       And it     is true that it was a     little&#13;
&#13;
difficult for him. I think I referred at lunchtime to a debt&#13;
&#13;
conference, which, in reality, he had organized himself, but&#13;
&#13;
the press report said that it had been "organized by Jean&#13;
&#13;
Baneth to show his discontent" with the Bank's timid debt&#13;
&#13;
policies. Because there was already a certain image,           that&#13;
&#13;
IEC was dissatisfied with the timidity of the debt relief&#13;
&#13;
policies officially advocated by the Bank,           even though I&#13;
&#13;
never went beyond the bounds of propriety. The papers of the&#13;
&#13;
debt task force were among the very few in the Bank which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 126&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Baneth (1/12/95), Page 127&#13;
&#13;
never leaked.       You never saw them,            I    bet,   very few did.&#13;
&#13;
They were numbered individually, on each page, so they were&#13;
&#13;
virtually non-Xeroxable,         because if you Xeroxed them the&#13;
&#13;
numbers showed whose classified copy they were from.                    People&#13;
&#13;
could have retyped it, but it didn't leak.&#13;
&#13;
     Nevertheless, as I said, we had gone out as far as we&#13;
&#13;
could,   in advocating a policy change.                 I   just re-read the&#13;
&#13;
newspapers, as I was packing my file of clippings. When Bush&#13;
&#13;
was giving his first press conference as President-elect in&#13;
&#13;
January of '89 was it?         No,   '88.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   '89, yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.    He was asked about debt,                  in a question which&#13;
&#13;
referred to the analysis of the just-out World Debt Tables,&#13;
&#13;
and he said,      "Yes, maybe we have to reconsider.                  You know&#13;
everything     is   changing,    and       the   Baker plan       has       to   be&#13;
reconsidered. "     And that was the beginning of Brady.                    So we&#13;
&#13;
had to press on with analyses for that, and maybe Fischer&#13;
&#13;
wanted to be in the forefront of that.                 Or maybe .... Others,&#13;
&#13;
colleagues   of     mine,    had various         theories      that   the    U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Treasury wanted to get rid of me.                 I don't really think I&#13;
&#13;
was a big enough boy for that, but who knows?.&#13;
&#13;
     Fischer did not come with an agenda which was different&#13;
&#13;
from what we were already doing.                 He was politically much&#13;
&#13;
closer to the way I feel, liberal in the American sense.                         He&#13;
&#13;
never told me,      "Look,    do this really quite differently!".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     127&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Baneth (1/12/95), Page 128&#13;
&#13;
Maybe I would have said "I'll do it",or maybe I would have&#13;
&#13;
said "I' 11 go. "    I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And he didn't have anybody else that he wanted to put&#13;
&#13;
into your--&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, another theory is that he did, but that the fight&#13;
&#13;
was    so disturbing and the people            in the Department made&#13;
&#13;
their feelings so very clear, that he decided not to put in&#13;
&#13;
his man     (or the man decided not to come) . You remember,&#13;
&#13;
there was this memorandum that they wrote to him and that&#13;
&#13;
everybody signed, not saying "You are wrong", but saying how&#13;
&#13;
much they liked and,          I   am blushing - admired me;      this&#13;
&#13;
would have made the position unattractive to an outsider.&#13;
&#13;
I do not think he had an insider in mind.            He may well have&#13;
&#13;
had an outsider in mind,          any outsider.     But you know the&#13;
&#13;
press articles which surround the Annual Meetings,              there&#13;
&#13;
were mentions these things, references of the "powerful man&#13;
&#13;
[Fischer]    who    just   reaffirmed    his    power by dispatching&#13;
&#13;
Baneth to Geneva, creating some staff dissatisfaction", and&#13;
&#13;
so on.    So my theory is that he had somebody in mind, that&#13;
&#13;
he had him in mind for '87 and because I stuck to my guns--&#13;
&#13;
thanks to Cosgrove's help, for a year, he could not get that&#13;
&#13;
man.&#13;
       [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 2)&#13;
&#13;
A:     Looking at IEC,     looking at D. C. Rao's work,       clearly&#13;
&#13;
Bruno has an agenda which is related also to the Prestonian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   128&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Baneth (1/12/95), Page 129&#13;
&#13;
  staff reductions and so on.                     With regards to Fischer, one&#13;
&#13;
  does not get the impression that he had an agenda other than&#13;
&#13;
  to make a name for Fischer as manager, because I cannot see&#13;
&#13;
  any major changes he wrought or even tried to bring.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:         So the year that you spent there working with him was&#13;
&#13;
  rather sort of full of strains and stresses and so on?&#13;
&#13;
  A:         Well, it was very curious.                    I spent first of all five&#13;
&#13;
  months, I got these news on the 31st of May--[BREAK IN TAPE,&#13;
&#13;
  OR TAPE RECORDING]&#13;
&#13;
  Q:         Okay.     So--&#13;
&#13;
 A:          We    worked     and,    by    and       large,     the    only   specific,&#13;
&#13;
  substantive          conflict       we    had was         about   the   International&#13;
&#13;
  Comparison Project             (ICP) . He wanted to use the ICP numbers&#13;
&#13;
  more       substantively than             I   did;       and   he was    a   friend   of&#13;
&#13;
  Summers and Kravis; he also wanted to allocate greater funds&#13;
&#13;
  for        the     project.    So    we       had    a     conflict     about   thatâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
 Otherwise we had no substantive conflict, not even on debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        82&#13;
        We organized, as we had done several times earlier, a&#13;
colloquium about ICP. One day I got a note from Fischer saying&#13;
he presumed that, of course, I was paying a honorarium to&#13;
those that attended. I wrote back, saying that my practice had&#13;
been never to pay a honorarium for mere attendance; I presumed&#13;
that attendance was equally beneficial to all attenders. To&#13;
academics and staff of organizations with very limited&#13;
budgets, we would pay travel and subsistence; many others&#13;
attended at their own cost. People who prepared papers or&#13;
otherwise worked outside the meeting itself would get&#13;
appropriate honoraria. And I concluded by writing "please let&#13;
me know i f you disagree". Fischer indeed disagreed, but&#13;
instead of calling me he called the Division Chief directly&#13;
and instructed him to pay honoraria to Summers (the Father of&#13;
his friend and successor) and Heston.&#13;
&#13;
                                                129&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Baneth (1/12/95), Page 130&#13;
&#13;
We     had        increasing     management      conflicts     because     of    his&#13;
&#13;
tendency to try to bypass me or keep me out. At length, that&#13;
&#13;
would have become intolerable, but because my associates in&#13;
&#13;
IEC were extremely loyal,               though they really did not know&#13;
&#13;
anything about what was going on 83 , they just kept coming to&#13;
&#13;
me.        They realized that there are some supervisors who try&#13;
&#13;
to bypass intermediate managers,                   and they came to me and&#13;
&#13;
involved me very heavily.               So it was a funny sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
           But I cannot say that we even had disputes during that&#13;
&#13;
period.           In fact, at some point he said, "Aaah, you know, we&#13;
&#13;
are getting along very fine,                    and I   do not want       this    to&#13;
&#13;
mislead you into thinking that I have given up on wanting&#13;
&#13;
you        to   go, "    which   struck   me     as   being    almost     surreal,&#13;
&#13;
surrealistic.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         Anyway, so in '88,        '89, you did go to Geneva.&#13;
&#13;
A:         Yes.     I rejected it at some point.               Hopper came back&#13;
&#13;
with offers of an advisory position, which I also rejected.&#13;
&#13;
Then at some point, even though I did not tell anybody else,&#13;
&#13;
I thought I could tell reasonably Conable.                       I did.    He did&#13;
&#13;
not reply anything, and it went on for a while and then at&#13;
&#13;
some point           I   got   the   intimation that      he    had decided on&#13;
&#13;
Fischer's side, and a little after that he called me and he&#13;
&#13;
said, "Look, it is a personality conflict, but I decide for&#13;
&#13;
Fischer. " There was an intervening episode.                       I don't know&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      83&#13;
           Fischer's efforts to get rid of me.&#13;
                                          130&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Baneth (1/12/95), Page 131&#13;
&#13;
whether this is of much interest,                        but Hopper said that I&#13;
have to go out to Geneva.                   He had first proposed that I&#13;
&#13;
should go to Geneva to think deep thoughts while Siebeck&#13;
&#13;
remained as Res Rep,             and I      refused.            And then Cosgrove&#13;
reconfirmed in writing,              that      I    had a       right    to be    in my&#13;
&#13;
position until          a    lateral     transfer         can be        arranged with&#13;
&#13;
something of       equal substance and interest.                        Then at    some&#13;
&#13;
point they called me into a meeting with Fischer, Cosgrove&#13;
was there,     and Fischer handed me a memorandum cleared by&#13;
&#13;
Legal which transferred me under Staff Rule whatever number&#13;
&#13;
it is, for lateral transfers, to Geneva as Director of the&#13;
&#13;
Geneva office, reporting to Fischer and with a full staff of&#13;
&#13;
one secretary.          So I listened and I said, "Okay, I have herd&#13;
you out".      Then I came back, because I thought I might have&#13;
&#13;
left a bad, misleading, impression, and said,                           "What I meant&#13;
&#13;
was that I heard you. I'll think about it, but my listening&#13;
&#13;
does not mean that I             accept this. "             I   think this was on&#13;
&#13;
Friday,     And    on       Monday   I   went       to     Cosgrove      and     said   I&#13;
appealed,    and if the appeal suspended the decision then I&#13;
&#13;
will continue to keep my peace,                         which was what they had&#13;
wanted, not tell my colleagues.                    And he said, "Of course, i f&#13;
&#13;
you appeal, nothing will happen."&#13;
&#13;
      And then a couple of months later Conable called me and&#13;
said I had to go to Geneva.               "But you can define what it is&#13;
&#13;
you   want,"      he    continued.       And       he    added,    to    some    extent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         131&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 132&#13;
&#13;
  truthfully,          that      trade   negotiations were        interesting;    if&#13;
&#13;
  there is one topic that interested him, it was trade.                          And&#13;
&#13;
  so I thought about it. I had appealed and I had won. But if&#13;
&#13;
  I appeal now, basically I can demand the same as the IMF 84 ,&#13;
&#13;
  because they can always say,                "How can you say this is not a&#13;
  Director's position?              It has been one in the IMF without any&#13;
  question."           And I went without any further ado to Geneva,&#13;
&#13;
  and it was reasonable fun.                 Hopper had obviously some pangs&#13;
&#13;
  of conscience.                I put on a travel budget which would have&#13;
&#13;
  allowed every single one of us to travel around the world&#13;
&#13;
  three times a year or something, and we never spent anything&#13;
&#13;
  like        it,    but   he    just    said yes,    and we went     around and&#13;
&#13;
  obtained the budget.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:         Now,    this was apart from the Bank's representation at&#13;
&#13;
  all        these    U.N.      organizations      located   in   Geneva   it    was&#13;
&#13;
  specifically with a mandate to monitor the trade--&#13;
&#13;
 A:          The expansion had to deal with trade and monitoring the&#13;
&#13;
  trade. negotiations              and reporting directly to          Conable     on&#13;
&#13;
  matters which pertained to Bank and GATT relations and so&#13;
&#13;
  forth 85 â&#128;¢        And I did in fact do so. While I was there I saw&#13;
&#13;
  Conable fairly frequently, on every visit I came here.                           I&#13;
&#13;
  don't know whether he was actually interested or it was his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        84&#13;
             Two professional staff members in addition to myself.&#13;
&#13;
       The mandate continued to include relations with all the&#13;
        85&#13;
&#13;
Geneva-based international organizations.&#13;
                                             132&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Baneth (1/12/95), Page 133&#13;
&#13;
conscience or what, but every time I reported I am coming,&#13;
&#13;
Miss McLaughlin made room from half an hour to an hour with&#13;
&#13;
Conable. Sometimes I told him,                 sometimes he told me about&#13;
&#13;
his recollections, but I was reporting to him.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        There,    but    there   was    nothing    memorable     about      what&#13;
&#13;
happened in Geneva?&#13;
&#13;
A:        No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        I note you wrote this report about Fortress Europe--&#13;
&#13;
A:        Yes.     That was--&#13;
&#13;
Q:        That was a by-product.&#13;
&#13;
A:        No.    I had made it very clear from the beginning that&#13;
&#13;
either you go to every meeting and you need 50 people, or&#13;
&#13;
you have to be very selective and we are not going to spend&#13;
&#13;
a    lot    of   time     reporting,     so even before     I    had my other&#13;
&#13;
associates I had hired a consultant, a young woman from the&#13;
&#13;
University         of     Clermont-Ferrand      to   come   out    and   go     to&#13;
&#13;
meetings, and that was all you needed, a reporter.                       It was&#13;
&#13;
a great experience for her.               It was plenty,        the Bank could&#13;
&#13;
never have obtained as good reports on trade negotiations as&#13;
&#13;
it did during that time.               And we did go to trade meetings,&#13;
&#13;
and we went to a few meetings selectively, and one of the&#13;
&#13;
secretaries even got to go to meetings and report on them&#13;
&#13;
and so on.         But you don't speak that often in Geneva.               You 86&#13;
&#13;
speak last, after the countries.                 So I made it very clear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     86&#13;
          The representatives of international organizations.&#13;
                                         133&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Baneth (1/12/95), Page 134&#13;
&#13;
from    the     beginning     that    we   wanted     to   do     something&#13;
&#13;
substantive, and I had quite a few articles and so on going,&#13;
&#13;
Piritta Sorsa clearly targeted a lot of work on environment-&#13;
&#13;
related issues,       and Gerhard Pohl first went into Eastern&#13;
&#13;
Europe and East Germany in particular.&#13;
&#13;
       But    then   Hopper   left,    and   Thalwitz      came    in,   and&#13;
&#13;
Thalwitz did not think we should do a great deal on Eastern&#13;
&#13;
Europe, so we were a bit up in the air, and then we decided&#13;
&#13;
to go into trade issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And, anyway, you stayed there until--&#13;
&#13;
A:     My three years were up.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     --'92.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And then, then you came back and this is also when they&#13;
&#13;
sort of folded up the Geneva office then?&#13;
&#13;
A:     They decided that a little before.             I always expected&#13;
&#13;
that the two additional people would not be out there after&#13;
&#13;
me, and even though I thought two secretaries were useful,&#13;
&#13;
I had told the second secretary that it was not sure that&#13;
&#13;
they would maintain that position.            It was clearly that the&#13;
&#13;
million dollars for the two extra professionals was just to&#13;
&#13;
get me out of the way.&#13;
&#13;
       I did not expect the folding up.             That came in a very&#13;
&#13;
funny way in the summer of '92 and I got informed almost by&#13;
&#13;
accident that there was even a debate about it.                 And by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     134&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Baneth (1/12/95), Page 135&#13;
&#13;
  time I knew there was a debate,           there had been a decision,&#13;
&#13;
  except that I did not know that there had been a decision&#13;
&#13;
  because nobody told me. It was a very funny type of thing.&#13;
&#13;
 And clearly a totally superficial decision, because a lot of&#13;
&#13;
  the related issues, they only started talking about later,&#13;
&#13;
  over the reporting and what not.              I had tried to argue that&#13;
&#13;
  they did not need to replace me immediately.                     They could&#13;
&#13;
  leave Piritta Sorsa in charge, as she was to stay until the&#13;
&#13;
  summer anyway. Even after that, why announce anything?                      Why&#13;
&#13;
  not wait until one could see what happens to the Uruguay&#13;
&#13;
  Round,      and then decide, while maintaining an antenna, with&#13;
&#13;
  one secretary who could hold the fort.                But no.    I think the&#13;
&#13;
  point      was    to   announce   it,   but    then     when    it   came    to&#13;
&#13;
  announcing it they got cold feet,               and wanted a letter by&#13;
&#13;
  Preston.         To announce it took a lot longer.&#13;
&#13;
            They decided, and I was fairly caustic about it, which&#13;
&#13;
  probably didn't contribute to my prospects 87 , but anyway ....&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Any thoughts about--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        I think they are now considering when to reopen it, but&#13;
&#13;
  that is by the way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       87&#13;
       Bilsel Alisbah was then the VP responsible for External&#13;
Relations and therefore the heir presumptive of the Geneva&#13;
Office if it reverted to its previous relationships with&#13;
Shakow and the External and International Relations Units, and&#13;
as such had been much involved in the decision. I wrote to him&#13;
that, no matter what the substantive merits of the final&#13;
decision itself, there could be no merit whatever in the&#13;
process that had arrived at the decision with such minimal&#13;
consultation of the Geneva Office itself.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                 Baneth (1/12/95), Page 136&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Right now?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, the World Trade Organization, the third pillar of&#13;
&#13;
the    system,     has   a   major    role      in   trade,      exchange      rates,&#13;
investment and everything.                How the hell can the Bank afford&#13;
&#13;
not to have close relations with it one way or the other?&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Well,     close relations doesn't necessarily mean being&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Every other organization will be.&#13;
Q:     Hmmmm.&#13;
&#13;
A:     So, anyway.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Any       thoughts      about,           about     Conable        and      his&#13;
administration, and the reorganization that he--?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I don't think Conable was an intellectual powerhouse.&#13;
&#13;
I think probably this is not a controversial a statement.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand--&#13;
Q:     Compared to Clausen, you would definitely think that he&#13;
&#13;
was less powerful?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I wouldn't really know.                 How do you know anybody?&#13;
&#13;
But my impression is that Clausen had a lot of ideas, but&#13;
was not very keen to put them out, or to put them out in&#13;
&#13;
front'.&#13;
       My impression is         that       Conable      had a    large Reader's&#13;
Digest in his head.          He had all these things pretty well set&#13;
out,   and often rather well presented,                    but    they were all&#13;
simple    little     digests.        It    is    rather   like     his    language&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          136&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Baneth (1/12/95), Page 137&#13;
&#13;
knowledge. When he was selected, I certainly had never heard&#13;
&#13;
of him.     I    read articles about how wonderful he is, and one&#13;
Congressmen was saying "and,                    you know,      I    was with him in&#13;
&#13;
Japan and suddenly I heard him talking in Japanese," so I&#13;
&#13;
thought,        he       must   really    be     somebody,         for    an   American&#13;
&#13;
Congressman from New York State to speak Japanese.                               Then I&#13;
&#13;
found out that he could say "hello," "good-bye" and "Happy&#13;
New Year"       in about 900 languages,                 but it did not go any&#13;
&#13;
further.    And to some extent,                 to me that is a bit of his&#13;
&#13;
whole person. He had a store of anecdotes.                               He could make&#13;
decisions.           I    don't   think     Conable      was        an    intellectual&#13;
&#13;
heavyweight.&#13;
&#13;
       On the other hand, he had a clear idea and probably a&#13;
necessary idea, that not only he wanted to reduce the size&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank, but he wanted to show that he was reducing it,&#13;
&#13;
and he wanted to exact a pint of blood. He wanted to be seen&#13;
&#13;
to have exacted a pint of blood, while trying to minimize&#13;
the bloodiness of the pint and the pintness of the blood.&#13;
&#13;
But he had a clear view, probably a correct view, at that&#13;
&#13;
time   this      was       needed to      get    over   the        hurdles     with   the&#13;
&#13;
American Congress.&#13;
       I don't know that he had much 'of a view beyond that.&#13;
He clearly had very good relations with (Secretary of the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury) Baker, and he clearly saw himself as implementing&#13;
&#13;
whatever the U.S. Treasury wanted in the best possible way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           137&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Baneth (1/12/95), Page 138&#13;
&#13;
And he did that.        Other countries let him do it; and after&#13;
&#13;
all, if that is what the other Treasuries want, that is what&#13;
the other Treasuries deserve.&#13;
&#13;
       He was not an unkind man.            He was not a stupid man.        He&#13;
&#13;
had this sort of country shrewdness.                He clearly did not&#13;
&#13;
inspire great confidence in his leadership among some of the&#13;
&#13;
other senior staff, but he kept them.               Maybe he should not&#13;
&#13;
have, maybe he should have, I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
       He clearly had no view as to how to transform the Bank&#13;
&#13;
(but     then   we   have   also    seen    that   from   others) ,    so   he&#13;
&#13;
decided, naively,       "Okay, I know that it has to be reduced,&#13;
&#13;
and I will let the Bank staff tell me what else to do".                      I&#13;
&#13;
will give him that justice, all the bloody nonsense of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization reports was produced by Bank staff,                      every&#13;
&#13;
single inch of it.          The only thing which he is,               in some&#13;
&#13;
sense,    responsible for,         is deciding to reduce the size of&#13;
&#13;
the staff.       Even the process,          this co-optation,    everybody&#13;
&#13;
fired and Conable hires two people,                those two hire five&#13;
&#13;
people, and those five hire everybody, which has foreseeably&#13;
&#13;
disastrous consequences for outspokenness,                it was not his&#13;
&#13;
invention.      It was the others who said that is how the Bank&#13;
&#13;
should proceed.       So, maybe he should not have let them, but&#13;
&#13;
he can say "I told the Bank there are these constraints.                    It&#13;
&#13;
was    my political     judgment      they are     there."      And    it   is&#13;
&#13;
probably true they were there.               And for the rest,        "I told&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      138&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Baneth (1/12/95), Page 139&#13;
&#13;
them to do it the best possible way, and they did."&#13;
&#13;
       I do not think he was one of the Bank's high moments -&#13;
&#13;
but ....      You know what they used to say- a Russian optimist&#13;
&#13;
was    a    man     saying,    "things       are     terrible,        things     are   so&#13;
&#13;
terrible they cannot possible get worse," and the pessimist&#13;
&#13;
said       "they can, they will."&#13;
&#13;
       I    suppose,       unlike Clausen,          he knew he came for five&#13;
&#13;
years maximum.             He knew he was coming as a service to his&#13;
&#13;
good friend Baker.            He clearly had very good relations with&#13;
&#13;
Baker.       He was ready to contradict him, or at least to point&#13;
&#13;
out things. Once,             I was discussing debt with him, I do not&#13;
&#13;
remember the year now, it was one of these debt briefings,&#13;
&#13;
I was alone with him, and then he said, "Okay, now I have to&#13;
&#13;
go up to tell Jim Baker that we need a capital increase. He&#13;
&#13;
has        said     that    when      the     Wor1 d          Bank    needs    capital&#13;
&#13;
replenishment we can get it.                      Well,   I    have to go and tell&#13;
&#13;
him that we need it now . "                  And probably Baker would have&#13;
&#13;
preferred to wait a little.                  So Conable did those things.&#13;
&#13;
       I think he saw his role as quite remote. Having made&#13;
&#13;
this one big decision, he thought the rest will be done by&#13;
&#13;
the rest of the Bank, and that was how it worked, with Ernie&#13;
&#13;
deciding          fairly   thorough    reforms        on the         financial    side,&#13;
&#13;
including the currency composition of borrowing ....&#13;
&#13;
       Oh,    I     should have come back to Clausen.                     He did do&#13;
&#13;
things at the beginning.              He did modify financial policies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            139&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Baneth (1/12/95), Page 140&#13;
&#13;
  including the way in which our lending rate is defined by&#13;
&#13;
  t           h         e                        B           a            n              k&#13;
&#13;
             McNamara,      as   you' 11   recall,      wanted       to,           in    effect,&#13;
&#13;
  reduce the inverse leverage, increase the leverage, reduce&#13;
&#13;
  the        relative       contribution    of       the     equity           to    whatever.&#13;
&#13;
  Clearly, that had implications not merely for the financial&#13;
&#13;
  solidity of the Bank,              but also for our profit structure,&#13;
&#13;
  because a lot of our profits is generated as we re-lend. We&#13;
&#13;
  borrow at 8, we re-lend at 8-1/2, but part of the money we&#13;
&#13;
  relend we don't borrow at all,                     the part that comes from&#13;
&#13;
  equity.         Well,     the more that part decreases,                     the more the&#13;
&#13;
  Bank's profits suffer, with a given spread between borrowing&#13;
&#13;
  and lending.&#13;
&#13;
             Because of      the gradual     decline of the equity base,&#13;
&#13;
  there had to be a gradual erosion of the profit base - not&#13;
&#13;
  of the overall profit, but of the profit base relative to&#13;
&#13;
  lending.        Additionally,       in   the       early       1980s,       we        had   been&#13;
&#13;
  endangered very seriously by the rapid increase in market&#13;
&#13;
  interest rates".&#13;
&#13;
             And Clausen handled that decisively,                    notably through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        88&#13;
       The Bank's liability structure had one very long-term&#13;
element, the equity base, whose relative importance was&#13;
decreasing, as each replenishment reduced the paid-in share&#13;
further; and the rest was variable, but on average medium&#13;
term. The Bank's asset structure was essentially composed of&#13;
twenty year loans. The sharp increase in refinancing costs&#13;
after 1979 was threatening to squeeze the Bank's profits. Any&#13;
profit squeeze would have endangered its borrowing ability.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                 Baneth (1/12/95), Page 141&#13;
&#13;
  the commitment fees.            Now, I would not be able to recite to&#13;
&#13;
  you from memory what it was that he did, but I was pretty&#13;
&#13;
  interested in these things,              I   have commented on some of&#13;
&#13;
  them,      and I       think he handled these issues decisively and&#13;
&#13;
  pretty well; in fact, very well 89 â&#128;¢                 And that was the main,&#13;
&#13;
  the only major financial reform,                until Ernie tied up the&#13;
&#13;
  exchange rate issues by pooling basically the exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
  risk and extending the pool--&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        This was in response to complaints--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        It    was    mostly   the   fact   that     all    these   wonderful&#13;
&#13;
  financial profits of '85 meant that all these billions of&#13;
&#13;
  DMs, which the developing countries had borrowed when they&#13;
&#13;
  were worth a third of a billion dollars each, they had to&#13;
&#13;
  repay them when they were worth rather over a half of a&#13;
&#13;
  billion dollars each.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        Now, looking back--&#13;
&#13;
  A:        Did   I     mention to you    that    in    '85,   discussing this&#13;
&#13;
  exchange rate issue, it was so bloody clear that I suddenly&#13;
&#13;
  had this sort of illumination, "if it's so clear, why not do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       89&#13;
        I am glad I spoke respectfully of Mr. Clausen. In&#13;
October 1995, going through Washington, I went to the dinner&#13;
of the 1818 H Society. Clausen was there, already seated at a&#13;
table -I thought quite in character that he should have come.&#13;
I had been a small fish in his day, and I did not feel&#13;
justified in going up to him and re-introducing myself. And to&#13;
my surprise, and great pleasure, he carne up to me after&#13;
dinner, re-introduced me to his wife, and chatted, relaxed and&#13;
pleasant. In many ways he had been the most humane of the&#13;
Bank's Presidents.&#13;
                                         141&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Baneth (1/12/95), Page 142&#13;
&#13;
  something about it"?             And I went to the Credit Union and&#13;
  took the maximum mortgage on my house and shifted it, the&#13;
  franc was already weak in those days so I shifted it into&#13;
&#13;
  DMs.&#13;
&#13;
           Now,   I    am saying this      to    illustrate     the degree      of&#13;
&#13;
  clarity.        I    was betting all our personal financial base&#13;
 basically ont that.           It should have been clear.              You can't&#13;
  have this sort of appreciation of the currency of a country&#13;
&#13;
 which has a           huge deficit,     exports were half of imports.&#13;
&#13;
 Senegal would say this can't continue. So why not the U.S.?&#13;
           I think the Bank was just merely misguided,                  at least&#13;
&#13;
  not to discuss the issue.              But it was so nice to have all&#13;
  these borrowings at relatively low interest currencies, put&#13;
&#13;
  them into dollar Treasuries and say,                "look at our profits.&#13;
&#13;
  We are so shrewd managing our finances that we make half a&#13;
&#13;
 million, half our profits come from financial management" 90 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
 Q:        Although      lately,   at    the    beginning      of     last   year,&#13;
&#13;
  everybody       was     convinced     that    the   dollar    was     going   to&#13;
&#13;
  appreciate.&#13;
 A:        That was why I went out and borrowed a million of the&#13;
&#13;
  stuff, as I told you, because it was clear to me that the&#13;
  market was not going that way forever. But I recognize that&#13;
&#13;
  last year,          it was touch and go, because it was not a huge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      90&#13;
       In retrospect, obviously Clausen also has some&#13;
responsibility for this. He was President, he should have&#13;
questioned Qureshi and Rothberg more sharply.&#13;
                                         142&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Baneth (1/12/95), Page 143&#13;
&#13;
  overvaluation.          One     has    to     have    one's     professional&#13;
  conscience.       That is why I also tell everybody what I am&#13;
&#13;
  doing.     It is not because I'm boasting after the fact.                   It&#13;
  is because I want to avoid doing this once- not having told&#13;
&#13;
  everybody,     hiding it from everybody,             including myself- and&#13;
&#13;
  then going down the drain financially.                So every time I make&#13;
&#13;
  a judgment, I share it with quite a few people.&#13;
&#13;
          You cannot blame the Bank for not having bet on that in&#13;
&#13;
  some way,      in 1993. '85 was different, and in '85 any blind&#13;
&#13;
  idiot should have seen that this cannot last forever.                      You&#13;
&#13;
  could    not    know   how    long    it    would    last.     And   I   admit&#13;
&#13;
  willingly that even in '84 every bloody blind idiot should&#13;
&#13;
  have seen that it could not last forever,                    but it did last&#13;
&#13;
  still another year 91 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     91&#13;
        That is much too strong. The buck stopped at Clausen,&#13;
and I have made it clear that I think he is far from being a&#13;
blind idiot; in fact, I have great respect for him. Nor is&#13;
Qureshi a blind idiot, nor even Gene Rotberg. Yet it is&#13;
difficult to find any other rational explanation to a policy&#13;
which not only neglected the huge opportunities offered to the&#13;
Bank by the Dollar's overvaluation in the mid-1980s, but&#13;
positively gloried in swapping much of our dollar borrowing&#13;
into european currencies and Yen - at what should have been&#13;
known to be very high risk to our borrowers. I suspect Qureshi&#13;
 (and even more, Rotberg) were tempted by the exchange of&#13;
immediate and highly visible profits to the Bank against high&#13;
risks to our borrowers. There is also a certain machismo of&#13;
financial instruments for their own sake -remember all the&#13;
boasting about the Bank's highly efficient and profitable&#13;
financial operations? and about our being the inventors of&#13;
currency swaps? not much has been heard thereafter about the&#13;
Bank using its invention to borrow dollars in 1985, and swap&#13;
them into DMs at the rate of more than three, and unwinding&#13;
the operation a rates often below 1.5. We in EPD were&#13;
forecasting the coming decline of the dollar; our forecasts&#13;
&#13;
                                        143&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Baneth (1/12/95), Page 144&#13;
&#13;
  Q:         Okay.&#13;
&#13;
  A:         That was it.         When I came back from Geneva I did this&#13;
&#13;
  work        on    project   evaluation,             which          as    I    told   you,   was&#13;
&#13;
  initially considered to be iconoclastic by Jim Adams and his&#13;
&#13;
  boys, and then they sort of hesitated about publication.&#13;
&#13;
  Ernie had had very favorable comments. But it was Jim Adams&#13;
&#13;
  who        said    he   would    consult       Ernie          on    the       suitability    of&#13;
&#13;
  publishing this paper.                 I hesitated to involve him myself,&#13;
&#13;
  maybe as Jim said he would involve him.                                      I think the Bank&#13;
&#13;
  would look stupid if I come out with this paper outside the&#13;
&#13;
  Bank,       saying the Bank tried to                  block             it.    And even more&#13;
&#13;
  stupid if I just say, "I have things to say but I can't say&#13;
                                                       92&#13;
  them because of Bank censorship.                          "   It's just ridiculous."&#13;
&#13;
             I give a pretty favorable account of what the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
  been doing on project evaluation, saying that our theory has&#13;
&#13;
  been awful but people mostly did not follow it, so project&#13;
&#13;
  selection has been pretty good, probably better than it is&#13;
&#13;
  put out by the OED, because in lots of African countries it&#13;
&#13;
  comes out saying,               "Oh,   God,     these projects have only six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were discussed by the Planning Assumptions Committee, and&#13;
accepted; but there was no debate of their implications. And I&#13;
guess Clausen, though sharp and a banker's banker, was too&#13;
American to worry much about exchange rates.&#13;
        92&#13;
       Well after a year later, as I am reviewing this draft,&#13;
the Bank still keeps telling me that it will publish the&#13;
paper, and it still has not done so Helen Hughes had a saying,&#13;
that "if sheer stupidity can explain something, look for no&#13;
further explanation". But I am beginning to wonder if such an&#13;
amount of sheer stupidity is truly available.&#13;
                                                144&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth (1/12/95), Page 145&#13;
&#13;
 percent         rate      of    return,        while    the   opportunity       cost    of&#13;
&#13;
  capital is 10 percent."                   The opportunity cost of capital&#13;
 means that the alternative use,                        anything else Upper Volta&#13;
&#13;
 would have done with it,                       would have yielded 10 percent.&#13;
&#13;
 Upper Volta should be so lucky!                        I think if you really have&#13;
&#13;
  six percent,            or even three percent,               compared to what the&#13;
&#13;
 alternative             use     would     have       been,    that    was   a    pretty&#13;
 successful project.&#13;
            And what was not successful was not so much project&#13;
&#13;
 selection,             but the macroeconomic policy.                 However,    that's&#13;
&#13;
 it.        Fini 93 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
 Q:         To wrap this up maybe, and looking back at the 30-odd&#13;
 years that you've spent                   in the Bank,         what have been the&#13;
&#13;
 highlights in terms of the kind of people that had the most&#13;
&#13;
 lasting impact on you--&#13;
 A:         The strongest impact is probably not people in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 but people in the field.                   I    remember the chap in Surabaya&#13;
&#13;
  telling me             "It's   good you         speak   Indonesian because            the&#13;
&#13;
  others only speak to the big people, and you speak to the&#13;
&#13;
  small people."               I must say it's more Indonesia than others&#13;
&#13;
 because I was closer and could talk to people there.                                   But&#13;
&#13;
 also the peasants in India who one way or the other had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       I have just been informed (in reply to a letter I sent&#13;
       93&#13;
&#13;
to Wolfensohn) that my paper will come out shortly - a news I&#13;
treat with the prudence due to any piece of information that&#13;
had been given repeatedly for the past fourteen months.&#13;
                                                145&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Baneth (1/12/95), Page 146&#13;
&#13;
  benefitted from a project.                    I remember the guy, whose name&#13;
  I    now    can't    recall,         a     huge     critic   of    the    Narmada,        in&#13;
  Gujarat.&#13;
&#13;
  Q:        - - - - - - - -?&#13;
  A:        Yes.     I saw him a few years ago when I was there, and&#13;
&#13;
  he said, "Yes, it's true that the World Bank contributed to&#13;
&#13;
  improving this. "               From his point of view.                   In my view,&#13;
&#13;
  incidentally,            it's    a        wonderful     project,      but       that's     a&#13;
&#13;
  different point.&#13;
            So, people I have met in the field,                     the peasants and&#13;
&#13;
  the others.          Manmohan Singh, who is really the epitome of&#13;
&#13;
  the dedicated civil servant,                      politician. He did not need&#13;
&#13;
  this 94 ,    and    he    does       it    because     he    thinks      it's    for     his&#13;
  country and, yes, I have developed much friendship with the&#13;
&#13;
  people in Indonesia.&#13;
            I have met in the Bank a variety of people. After my&#13;
  first economic committee meeting, Bill Brakel asked me what&#13;
&#13;
  was my impression, and I said,                      "You know, my impression is&#13;
&#13;
  there are fewer fools here than in the general population."&#13;
&#13;
  And I think that is true.                     And I     think it is still true.&#13;
&#13;
  And I think that is good, by the way.&#13;
            Without becoming maudlin,                 I like to think back of my&#13;
  association with IEC,                and that we both worked pretty well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       94&#13;
       He was at the time of the interview and at the time of&#13;
writing this, India's Minister of Finance.&#13;
                                                146&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Baneth (1/12/95), Page 147&#13;
&#13;
together. That, after all, here was a Vice President who had&#13;
&#13;
just fired me, and the staff wrote him a memorandum saying&#13;
&#13;
that I was a wonderful guy and they deplored my loss.                      It&#13;
&#13;
does not happen everywhere. It takes a certain organization&#13;
&#13;
for that to happen.            So all these are high points.&#13;
&#13;
     I   don't think that McNamara or Conable or all these&#13;
&#13;
guys are the high point.            Although McNamara was very bright,&#13;
&#13;
somehow one had the impression he always was pursuing some&#13;
&#13;
hidden aims, he had a mixup between aims and means, and you&#13;
&#13;
always had this sort of question,                "does he really believe&#13;
&#13;
this?"     It is very difficult to work that way.&#13;
&#13;
     I personally have retained an excellent memory of Peter&#13;
&#13;
Cargill.        I    think he had an extraordinarily sharp brain,&#13;
&#13;
which he retained even when he was completely dissolved in&#13;
&#13;
alcohol,    and he still he had this capacity to see through&#13;
&#13;
things. I know he had a very good heart, which he tried to&#13;
&#13;
hide, but it was apparent in several occasions.&#13;
&#13;
     There are many such people, I was lucky with my early&#13;
&#13;
bosses and I guess it's luckier to be lucky with your early&#13;
&#13;
bosses than with later bosses.                 Bill Brakel was my first&#13;
&#13;
Division Chief.           Ben King I met later.           He never was my&#13;
&#13;
boss, or very shortly, but we worked well together.                 Manfred&#13;
&#13;
Blobel     is       another   man   whom   I   remember   fondly   and   with&#13;
&#13;
admiration.&#13;
     So I think my memory is of an organization which was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       147&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Baneth (1/12/95), Page 148&#13;
&#13;
set up by extraordinarily clear-sighted people.                    To think of&#13;
&#13;
development    even   before   the        invasion    in     Normandy     takes&#13;
&#13;
something.    It is still working towards that purpose. I have&#13;
&#13;
been very free with my criticism of it, but basically, the&#13;
&#13;
Bank   is   meandering but     it    is    still     going    in    the   right&#13;
&#13;
direction,    it has greatly contributed to the understanding&#13;
&#13;
of development,     and to the financing and to raising money&#13;
&#13;
for the financing of development.&#13;
&#13;
       Big mistakes, I think the biggest mistake perhaps, was&#13;
&#13;
not perceiving the coming of the debt crisis and not acting&#13;
&#13;
on it, which set back so many countries for so long.                        But&#13;
&#13;
they are still living.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Perhaps a good note to end on.           Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
       [END OF RECORDING, TAPE 2, SIDE 1)&#13;
1. The "social" part of the Vander Tak methodology- the one that&#13;
pretended to incorporate income-distribution and similar welfare&#13;
issues into the rates of return of projects - was tacitly abandoned&#13;
after a relatively short period. Economic rates of return calculations&#13;
continue, and continue to apply the Van der Tak - Squire methodology;&#13;
but its flaws are so great that the application is often perfunctory.&#13;
Nevertheless, like many old ideologies, though the method clearly does&#13;
not really govern project selection by the Bank, and never actually&#13;
did, it constitutes a useful fig-leaf for the absence of any other&#13;
rational method. It also helps disguise all manners of arbitrary or&#13;
politically guided project selection. Hence it is fiercely defended. I&#13;
have done a report on this issue during my last period of active Bank&#13;
life. It was finished in late 1994; publication required the signature&#13;
of the Director, OPS (Jim Adams), to whose Department I was formally&#13;
attached. His subordinates thought the report unduly critical and&#13;
capable of embarrassing the Bank, and advised against publication. I&#13;
have received repeated assurances that censorship would not be&#13;
attempted, but neither was publication, actually, until this date (10&#13;
April 1996) .&#13;
&#13;
2. Many of the issues of the period get short-changed in the oral&#13;
remin1scences - I let myself go off on a single track. Wit calmer&#13;
hind-sight, the main issues in which I was concerned as Chief&#13;
Economist, Asia and South Asia, were the following:&#13;
      Project selection - already discussed. related to it was the&#13;
issue of the Chief Economist's involvement with projects. Pre-1972 the&#13;
Economic Advisers, who were the Chief Economists' predecessors, were&#13;
exclusively in the Area Departments, and had no interest in projects.&#13;
&#13;
                                    148&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Baneth (1/12/95), Page 149&#13;
&#13;
Most of the Chief Economists also saw it that way, and, even more so,&#13;
the Project Directors. I wanted to follow the organizational chart,&#13;
which made the Chief economist responsible for advising on all&#13;
economic issues.&#13;
      Energy and oil prices. The crisis hit the Bank quite unprepared;&#13;
the forecast of the Commodities Division, published well after the&#13;
increase, still projected much lower prices (I recall writing some&#13;
sarcastic comments about not forecasting the past&#13;
Ceylon (Sri Lanka) :&#13;
&#13;
 3. Clausen made the changes he thought indispensable - including some&#13;
form of collective responsibility through the "Managing Committee". It&#13;
took him some time to find out that the Bank's culture was unsuited to&#13;
open debate of major issues, even in such a small committee; and&#13;
therefore there was no mechanism for sorting out a few decisions the&#13;
President himself had to take - except by hiding the issues. He was a&#13;
strong man, just not well suited to the Bank environment. I suspect&#13;
that his bad relations with the US administration were for much in&#13;
this; he had no power base either inside the Bank or outside it. He&#13;
may well have become much more decisive if Baker had renominated him.&#13;
It is much to his honor that he did not want to make big changes that&#13;
would soon be reversed by his successor. He did fast make the changes&#13;
he thought indispensable - notably the financial ones, which preserved&#13;
the Bank's solvency, much compromised during the last McNamara years.&#13;
And remember, this is the man whom the Board of the Bank of America,&#13;
that knew him, wanted to go back to that firm when it was in big&#13;
trouble; and who put it back on the right track in very little time,&#13;
by taking brilliant, and when necessary ruthless, measures.&#13;

                                        Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This is an amendment to the oral history interview conducted with Jean Baneth last&#13;
year. Today is September 11 , 1996. I'm J ochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: I am Jean Baneth, the interviewee.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, Jean, it's good to see you back here. We wanted to talk a little bit about your&#13;
involvement in the early phases of restarting relationships with the Bank, between the Bank and&#13;
Vietnam. I believe you went to Vietnam on several oecasions. I suppose this was during your&#13;
(;lSSignment in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Yeah. Actually, let me clarify a little. First of all, if you don't mind, I will go out&#13;
slightly outside of my own personal experience to tell you what I know about it because if one&#13;
day somebody writes the hundred year history of the Bank or the hundred year history of&#13;
Western relations with Vietnam I think this might be of some interest.&#13;
&#13;
I think I should go back before Vietnam, actually, and speak oflndochina. And this might to&#13;
some extent repeat what I said earlier. I hope not too much.&#13;
&#13;
In 1973, that is after the ceasefires or peace agreements had been concluded in Indochina, the&#13;
Laotians approached the Bank for resumed lending. The World Bank had not been lending to&#13;
Laos previously, unlike, say, the Asian Development Bank which had been making loans. At&#13;
that point I was still chief economist for Asia as a whole, and Peter Cargill asked me to have a&#13;
look at the situation there. And my conclusion-! suppose economic conclusion--was that the&#13;
Laotians were for the time being well fed and reasonably, at least in the government controlled&#13;
zones, essentially because of the large amount of aid coming in, that the government--despite the&#13;
cease fire, the government and the other zone were completely separate. What had really&#13;
happened is that the central government, so-called, had acquired some Pathet Lao ministers and,&#13;
in good communist fashion, what was the government's was then to be shared but what was the&#13;
Pathet Lao's nobody was to set foot in there. But actually even the sharing was limited, so by&#13;
and large it was considered that the government zone's status was not too much in any of the&#13;
other zones either. And for the government people, World Bank assistance was seen essentially&#13;
as it related to AID [U.S. Agency for International Development] assistance, and that was in&#13;
truth the perception of the AID locally, either.&#13;
&#13;
I was there at the same time as an Asian Development Mission composed of Mr. [David F.]&#13;
Fisher, who subsequently was, I think, a vice president or possibly director at ADB, and Mr.&#13;
Susaka [phonetic], who is still there. We clashed somewhat because they were very keen on&#13;
lending and my findings were that this was no way of starting, for us to start a new relationship,&#13;
and that the conditions for a countrywide loan in any sense were not really--or, for that matter,&#13;
for an economic mission because we had no access to the other zone-were not there. I will--&#13;

and that in fact the communists did not really want, really. They said, "Okay, if you can have an&#13;
agreement with the government people, then that's fine by us, but certainly we are not party to&#13;
that." I guess their attitude was well symbolized by Souphanouvong, who said at some point,&#13;
"We well know the name of Mr. McNamara, but we don't immediately associate it with rural&#13;
development."&#13;
&#13;
To what extent was it the evolution of the situation itself, to what extent was it my own persistent&#13;
efforts, by early '74 they had actually agreed and we ran an economic mission and there was a&#13;
general consensus within the government on both sides that they wanted some Bank assistance.&#13;
And subsequent to that, there was an aid group meeting, chaired by the ADB and organized in&#13;
Manila, to which both parties came. The arrangement was the finance minister was on board the&#13;
ex-government's side and his deputy was on the ex-Pathet Lao side, and both came. That gave&#13;
me some contact with the problems.&#13;
&#13;
Also, being chief economist, I was aware--although not more than, I suppose, many other&#13;
people--that the Bank was under considerable pressure from the U.S. administration to make&#13;
loans to Vietnam, South Vietnam, essentially the same reason they wanted us but with much less&#13;
keenness or much less strong pressure to make loans to quote "government zone" unquote in&#13;
Laos, i.e., essentially to replace American aid which Congress was at that point cutting and for&#13;
which there was no local replacement.&#13;
&#13;
I did not participate in the mission to South Vietnam, which was run by Manfred [Blobel]. And&#13;
in all honesty I can't even recall whether I had fully read-at least I don't recall the tenor of its&#13;
content, exactly what it recommended. I recall conversations with Manfred about how much&#13;
pressure there was to find that lending is possible. And my somewhat hazy recollection is that&#13;
in fact, although fudging it, it was not impossible to conclude from the report that some lending&#13;
was justified. In any case, the Bank was actively getting involved in preparing a non-project&#13;
loan for South Vietnam. Again, giving the benefit of the doubt, how much of this active&#13;
preparation was to say that we are doing something and perhaps something at the last moment&#13;
and how much it was getting on to the last step, I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
Peter Cargill, who was in charge of the whole of Asia until the middle of '74, was clearly very&#13;
skeptical about any benefit. I am not saying that he wouldn't have bent to pressure. Bernie Bell&#13;
was much more actively--{)r at least gave the impression, gave the outward appearance; I don't&#13;
know what was inside-of being much more actively favorable to both lending in the case of&#13;
Vietnam and lending in the case of Laos, at least as long as the coalition did not get more&#13;
strongly a real coalition.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was, though, at that point not really directly involved. He was then dealing with&#13;
East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, no, Bernie Bell took over in July 1, '74.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: But that was when Asia was split and Cargill went up and became finance ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: That's correct, and that's when Bernie took over. Now I was--Bernie had asked me&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jean Baneth&#13;
                                  September 11, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    152&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to go to East Asia, at least I think he did. In the end, I stayed with South Asia for a variety of&#13;
reasons, among them that I was already thinking of moving overseas, and I thought it would be&#13;
more difficult to go out of East Asia where, even though I had been responsible for both, I was&#13;
clearly much less directly involved. But I had specified and he had accepted that I would remain&#13;
involved with Indochina even though I was moving to the other side.&#13;
&#13;
Yeah, Cargill moved up, and even before moving up, you know, he had his first nose bleeding&#13;
attack which was a signal of his liver problems, I guess, in early '74, so he was involved but not&#13;
all that active, although my experience of Cargill, by the way, is that five minutes ofhis were&#13;
often two months of work for others, but never mind.&#13;
&#13;
Cargill had accepted my-I mean, I think Cargill was trying to delay Vietnam. I don't really&#13;
know that.&#13;
&#13;
Without actually knowing, all my impression-and I was fairly closely trying to follow it--was&#13;
that Bernie Bell was pushing towards making possible this lending to Vietnam, both because&#13;
clearly the Bank, McNamara was under pressure: the replenishments, sympathetic attitude of the&#13;
U.S. government. In Bernie's case I think there may have been more. He probably both&#13;
believed in an anti-Communist mission; he had at some point, I believe, advised the USAID,&#13;
including on government of Vietnam dealings, and there may have been something left of that,&#13;
so it wasn't simply a reluctant recognition that the Bank had to do something, you know, give&#13;
some of the money to Vietnam if anything was to happen.&#13;
&#13;
I can't recall the exact date, either, and again if some future historian is interested you can look it&#13;
up: there was an aid group meeting in Paris called for by the Bank, and that must have been-&#13;
there definitely was under Bernie's presidency; it was either late '74 or early '75. It was for&#13;
Vietnam--well, it wasn't an aid group because there was no aid group, but it was a sort of aid&#13;
discussion meeting or whatever you call it.&#13;
&#13;
There were street protests in Paris, although in the end very minor although strong enough to&#13;
prompt the Bank to ask for police protection and all that. In the end, they held a counter meeting&#13;
in the Mutualitie, denounced World Bank action and all that.&#13;
&#13;
The meeting had been held against the protests of quite a few people who then came to&#13;
participate, who said, "Why do you need a meeting?" And ...&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The Scandinavians ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: The Scandinavians, the French, their protest muted by the fact that Mr. Neveau&#13;
[phonetic ]--one never understood quite what the hell he was saying but I think he was saying that&#13;
having a meeting was not a good idea. And even I don't think there was anybody vocally&#13;
supporting it, not even the Americans, although they clearly had wanted it, but they didn't really&#13;
want to be very vocal, except Bernie had this strong argument based on the economic report--&#13;
which is what confuses me, I say, since the economic report was pointing at difficulties; it didn't&#13;
actually bar lending--that non-project aid would be justified and both IDA and desirable donors&#13;
can come m.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jean Baneth&#13;
                                  September 11, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 153&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I cannot say that I have any recollection of it being mentioned, either at the meeting or in private&#13;
conversations, that one of the reasons for which we were so desirable for the Americans was not&#13;
simply the money but also the ability to present this as now being an international effort, which&#13;
might have got them marginally more favorable treatment in Congress.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, it was a very contentious meeting, although, as I said, Bernie was I think putting his&#13;
heart into it not just obeying orders, but clearly he was also in close contact with McNamara, and&#13;
certainly the signals he was getting from up there was not a signal to go more slowly, to put it&#13;
mildly.&#13;
&#13;
And that episode and Congress' follow-up in the following month or so-again, the time period&#13;
is hazy; the following short period--leave me with the belief that had in fact the collapse of the&#13;
South waited for another six months the Bank would have made its first credit to--or certainly,&#13;
depending on the time left, we may have made subsequent [inaudible] to South Asia. The&#13;
machinery was moving ahead.&#13;
&#13;
I think this is interesting. It will be interesting to consider in the context of McNamara's claims&#13;
about having become disenchanted, or what he is disenchanted with what. In fact what reminded&#13;
me and what prompted my desire to put in this additional note was reading about the McNamara&#13;
book (which I haven't read myself; don't intend to).&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile in Laos in a sense developments were in the other direction. By the time the&#13;
consortium, the aid group meeting happened, the collapse of--in Manila-Â·sorry, let me go back a&#13;
few steps.&#13;
&#13;
This is parenthesis: this is what makes transcripts so difficult. End of parenthesis.&#13;
&#13;
We went out on the economic mission in early January '75, and by a month later I was back with&#13;
complete reports, bilingually. We worked very fast and very hard to get that. And it is really at&#13;
that time that there seemed to be a consensus on both sides of the government that, "Okay, if you&#13;
can do a reconstruction loan or similar lending, you will have access to all the relevant territory.&#13;
It will not be reserved to one area and, yes, we air want this help from the World Bank and we&#13;
are ready to talk about policy" and so on. And that is when I recommended there should be an&#13;
aid group, that the Bank should go ahead and participate in the aid group meeting and prepare&#13;
actively for lending. Most of the lending, by the way, would have gone directly to what was then&#13;
the government region, the Vientiane plain, but we also recommended some other types of loans,&#13;
including the refugee repatriation which Burke Knapp turned down but which would have gone&#13;
to the ex-Pathet Lao or the still Pathet Lao controlled region, with the very clear understanding&#13;
that it would have to be fully inspected and ...&#13;
&#13;
By the time the aid meeting happened, must have been around April--I again haven't looked at&#13;
the dates. I know the Vietnamese collapse had begun but not ended; they must have been&#13;
roughly at the stage when they evacuated Pleiku and the high plateaus, when the rout of the&#13;
South Vietnamese army started but before the collapse of Saigon. But I think by then the sign of&#13;
things to come was fairly clear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jean Baneth&#13;
                                 September 11, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  154&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Greg Votaw had come to the meeting, and I was there and [Nicholas] Gorjestani--by the way, if&#13;
anybody wants to look things up later, who was also in the Laos mission, Nicolai Gorjestani.&#13;
Greg spoke with the Laotians, were quite positive and quite enthusiastic about World Bank&#13;
involvement. By the time we came back and reported to Bernie, he transmitted our joint&#13;
memoranda with a covering note to McNamara saying, "Well, of course this is much too&#13;
enthusiastic, and I think lending to Laos is several years in the future," or words to that effect.&#13;
And I can't help feeling this was related to the change in the political situation, the perception. I&#13;
don't know what. McNamara's reaction to this was, but I doubt that he himself was very negative&#13;
towards Bernie's position. I think Bernie would not have reacted in this way.&#13;
&#13;
Then came the complete collapse and change of actual power in Vietnam. The new South&#13;
Vietnamese government was formed, and theoretically it was still an independent South Vietnam&#13;
for a time, recognized by most foreign governments and most European governments, although&#13;
not the U.S. at that time.&#13;
&#13;
Contrary to your introduction-! did not make myself clear--I did not go to Vietnam at that time,&#13;
but I met with the Vietnamese delegation to a meeting in Jakarta. I think it was iri several stages.&#13;
First, there was a technical delegation, and it so happened that Yee [phonetic] knew one of the&#13;
members, who is still alive, by the way, but a very elderly gentleman who was from the same&#13;
town as Yee in South Vietnam and who then had been in the Netherlands and so on. Then he&#13;
arranged for another delegation to meet me which included the-either Deputy Governor,&#13;
subsequently Governor or already Governor of the Central Bank of South Vietnam. I think he&#13;
was Governor ofthe Central Bank of South Vietnam who subsequently became Deputy&#13;
Governor of the Vietnamese Central Bank when they formally reunified the country. They had&#13;
not responded to any Bank writing or anything at that time, and my main effort was to persuade&#13;
them not to forgive the possibility of staying full World Bank members and that included&#13;
sending a delegation to th~ forthcoming Annual Meeting which would have been in Manila.&#13;
&#13;
They did that. I had no contact with the Bank side on that effort, but I did that very much as a&#13;
private capacity, although I sense no disloyalty to the Bank and I still don't think there was any&#13;
disloyalty in the Bank in persuading a potentially important member to maintain the necessary&#13;
links.&#13;
&#13;
They did come to Manila, and there again I sensed a very-well, very unwelcoming reactions&#13;
from high up, considerable enthusiasm within the staff up to fairly high levels, including, I think,&#13;
Greg Votaw, who was around at that time, but not higher up. And this was confirmed by a report&#13;
I had from-letter I had later from a chap who was in the Tokyo office who must have&#13;
participated in some of our meetings with the Vietnamese delegation. I don't have recollection&#13;
of who was at those meetings by now. The reason I recollect this chap is that I found his letter in&#13;
my file in which he writes, with a bit of a surprise, "Here are the minutes of a meeting which&#13;
Bernie had with the Vietnamese in Tokyo." And I don't know exactly what the occasion for that&#13;
was; of course it [inaudible] the place. And in these minutes Bernie explained to the Vietnamese&#13;
that what they had to do is to basically apply for membership at the Bank. And we staff very&#13;
well knew that applying for membership meant either the Americans agreed, in which case there&#13;
is no problem, or much more likely the Americans veto it, in which case there is no problem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jean Baneth&#13;
                                 September 11, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                155&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
either. This chap writes with a bit of surprise, "Doesn't this go contrary to what we had told the&#13;
Vietnamese earlier?" which is that they just have to assert their membership as South Vietnam&#13;
and then transfer it in some sense to a reunified Vietnam, if and when that comes along.&#13;
&#13;
Again, I cannot--although I cannot believe that Bernie was acting against McNamara's wishes in&#13;
that respect, wishes to which he has always been very sensitive.&#13;
&#13;
Basically this is the-well, the whole of my direct involvement under Bernie's time.&#13;
&#13;
Then Bernie left the Bank; Shahid Husain came in. Subsequent to our various meetings with the&#13;
Vietnamese and being persuaded and obviously finding some of my explanations helpful, they&#13;
wrote to the Bank that they would like to have a World Bank economic mission, which we had&#13;
told them was a first step, but before having it they would like to have me come around and&#13;
explain to them a little better about an economic mission is. And that's when Greg Votaw and&#13;
[E.K.] Hawkins replied that actually that "You don't need Mr. Baneth because we are coming."&#13;
&#13;
The last stage as far as I am concerned is simply when Shahid Husain came over. At the&#13;
beginning Shahid was very hostile to Greg and therefore very favorable to anybody with whom&#13;
Greg seemed to have some problem to get along with, although my problem was limited,&#13;
exchange as the slices of the [inaudible] got away. But he, I think, genuinely-quite apart from&#13;
anything-he genuinely wanted lending to Vietnam. He considered that interesting; he&#13;
considered it a part of the Bank's mission; he considered it part ofShahid's mission and probably&#13;
was less, or possibly was less sensitive to McNamara's wishes in that matter. I think, in any&#13;
case, he genuinely was interested in getting involved.&#13;
&#13;
Things were not advancing very fast at that point, so I got an invitation from the Vietnamese-&#13;
and I admit that I included myself in it--which in the end they invited Shahid and me to visit&#13;
Vietnam and discuss future relations. That unfortunately came to nothing when the Governor of&#13;
the Central Bank fell ill just when the trip was supposed to be coming, but Bank lending&#13;
proceeded with the first reconstruction loan or whatever it was called, very much along the lines&#13;
which I thought were desirable and I think with a genuine push from Shahid.&#13;
&#13;
And I guess the last thing I may want to say: although there had been a mission to Vietnam, I&#13;
had reported on perhaps not the very first meeting but certainly on subsequent meetings with&#13;
Shahid. Then when I went out to Vietnam-my first trip was in 1979; I had never been there&#13;
alone but I think I could, was able to travel better and more than even the Bank missions because&#13;
of my Vietnamese interpreter and so on. And I reported on that, and I did tell McNamara that I&#13;
had been there and I would be glad to tell him anything about it that he wanted to know. And&#13;
this was not as if McNamara was far remote from me because both through his visit to Indonesia&#13;
I had been involved with him, earlier as a chief economist, and when I came back from Indonesia&#13;
I was--finally I was Joe [D. Joseph] Wood's replacement for a year, so in fact I was fairly often&#13;
not only in meetings but fairly often with McNamara directly. But he never raised the subject;&#13;
he never expressed any interest; he never even asked for a paper or something, "Send me&#13;
something" or so on. So I am a little skeptical about his great interest or great regrets, except&#13;
perhaps regrets in the sense, "Why did I go into this thing which gives me such a very bad&#13;
press," which yes, that definitely he does have.                                '&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, the other interesting aspect was McNamara's reaction. Now, in some of the&#13;
other histories, there is a reference to the fact that whenever the subject of Vietnam came up with&#13;
McNamara, he was sort of reacting very irrationally 6r very emotionally or it was very hard to&#13;
understand ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: You mean Vietnam qua war?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                               159&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, Vietnam-! mean lending to Vietnam after '75. And it was one of the things&#13;
that I also found difficult to reconcile with his professed wish to kind of make good and repair&#13;
some of the damage that he had been party to inflicting in the first place. But there was a&#13;
suggestion that maybe that was because he really deeply resented that there was a country that&#13;
sort of had defeated him. There was a government that had inflicted personal defeat on him and&#13;
that he found it very difficult to turn around and do business with that government.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Well, first of all, I never directly discussed-! wrote a few notes but I never actually&#13;
discussed Vietnam with him because he never picked up the possibility, so all I can report on is&#13;
indirectly his reaction through Bernie or Shahid Husain. I certainly don't sense any desire to&#13;
help the country even by putting policy conditionality or helping get out of the war or help them&#13;
get mines off. Or I would put this even more strongly: I think none these things was there. I&#13;
don't think any of these things was there.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, whether it is a personal pique or simply his desire not to get on the wrong side&#13;
of the U.S. for the fact and the reason that the U.S. was always--in his days, in any case--the&#13;
constraint on the Bank IDA. IDA could have always been nominally bigger, replenishment of&#13;
the Bank would have always been easier had the U.S. been more forthcoming. And so I would&#13;
say, rather, my impression was, "No weight attached to Vietnam, so why should I take up the&#13;
problem of [inaudible] except inasmuch as the other constituencies are pushing?" And because&#13;
of the stupid way in which the Vietnamese handled Cambodia that push stopped at that point. So&#13;
he said, "Fine. Well, we don't have to lend anymore."&#13;
&#13;
The Europeans, I think, would have been quite willing to accept Vietnamese intervention in&#13;
Cambodia, particularly after the dimensions of what had been going on there became apparent,&#13;
except for the Vietnamese statement, basically, "We are reconstituting the old Indochina sphere."&#13;
I think in practice the Vietnamese would have had to stay there militarily anyway because had&#13;
they withdraWn the Khmer Rouge would have come in. But if they had said, "Look, chaps,&#13;
come in, send in the UN, send in anybody, or you are responsible for genocide," the Europeans&#13;
would have remained favorable. As it is, they said, "Okay, well, you know, to hell with it." And&#13;
then China came in, and of course with McNamara that was a much bigger fish than Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
There may have been personal pique also, but I have no evidence for that. And perhaps&#13;
psychoanalyzing him, it might have been, it might have prompted a more curious attitude: "Let&#13;
me find out about it." Perhaps not. Perhaps it would have been, "Okay, let me deny the whole&#13;
thing and not be interested." But I don't know. Okay?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Anyway, that's been very interesting. Thank you very much.&#13;
