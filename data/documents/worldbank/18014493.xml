&#13;
BECKER:      Good morning. Today is March 7, 2005, and I'm William Becker with the Business&#13;
History Group and the George Washington University, and I'm here today to interview Peter&#13;
Woicke. So, Mr. Woicke, nice to see you, and I appreciate very much ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Nice to see you. Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'd like to start with some fairly obvious questions. When and where were you&#13;
born?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I was born January 29, 1943, in a small place near Dresden in East Germany.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Where did you receive your education?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: We left East Germany in the mid-'50s, and I was brought up in Frankfurt, so I went&#13;
to school in Frankfurt, and then after working doing the classical German apprenticeship in a&#13;
bank, I did my studies of business administration at the University of Saarbrucken.&#13;
                                                                â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. And you said those were studies in business and banking?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: It was basically business administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Did you begin work at JPMorgan immediately following graduation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. I had worked for JPMorgan during one of my summer vacations, and they&#13;
basically asked me to--whether I would consider working for them. And I got my graduate&#13;
degree at the end of 1969, and I started working at JPMorgan in Frankfurt, was trained for one&#13;
year in New York, and then spent the next two years in Frankfurt, basically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Could you describe--this is going to be difficult--briefly your career at&#13;
JPMorgan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. I basically joined an American bank because they at that point were more&#13;
internationally oriented than the European and German banks. And so I--after three years in&#13;
Frankfurt, where I covered basically new clients for Morgan in Germany, I had the opportunity&#13;
to be transferred to Beirut in Lebanon, where JPMorgan had a 40-percent participation in a local&#13;
bank and a management contract. It was a retail bank. And I was asked as a very young man to&#13;
build up the wholesale banking, the business, the corporate business with the larger clients in&#13;
Lebanon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It was a fascinating time. Unfortunately, this was the time the civil war started. The civil war&#13;
started in 1975. I was transferred to Beirut in '73. And after one year of civil war, we decided to&#13;
leave. It became unbearable. And I then was transferred to London where the boom in the North&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sea oil development, oil and gas development, had just started. Morgan had a pretty prominent&#13;
group, role in the development of development finance of North Sea oil. I joined this group and&#13;
became head a year later and ran the group from 1978 until 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It was great fun because we were very successful. We basically financed 90 percent of all the&#13;
big projects in the North Sea at this time, also got involved in some financing in Malaysia,&#13;
energy-related, in Malaysia and in Australia. And then in '82 I was asked whether I would be&#13;
interested to run a new joint venture in Brazil. Morgan had always tried to get a foothold in&#13;
Brazil. It was difficult at the time, either buying an existing foreign license or do a joint venture,&#13;
and this was a joint venture between a Brazilian group, a Portuguese group, and Morgan had the&#13;
management contract again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The joint venture was not very successful. We decided to pull out because our business ethics&#13;
were slightly different than our partners, which we discovered a little bit late. And so after three&#13;
years, I negotiated the withdrawal from the joint venture, purchased a license to operate our own&#13;
bank, and established branches in Rio and in Sao Paulo, which became in terms of Morgan's&#13;
business quite successful. Remember that this also coincided with the Latin American debt&#13;
crisis. Morgan had big exposure in Latin America, and while I was building the local business, I&#13;
was also very heavily involved in negotiating the debt with the Brazilian government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then, finally, in 1987 I was transferred to the head office in New York where I had a number&#13;
of jobs, which included running the securities company, running technology and the back office,&#13;
being in charge of Latin America, and finally being in charge of all the global markets, all&#13;
trading worldwide..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I probably would describe best my role at JPMorgan as fixing things. Things which didn't work&#13;
I was asked to take a look at and then tum around. In '95, Morgan reorganized itself, put an&#13;
emphasis more on regional development. The world was split into Europe, the Americas, and&#13;
Asia. Again I was asked to go to Asia and run Asia because Morgan's business in Asia was&#13;
prominent and very successful only in Japan. But there was very little business in the other&#13;
countries, so I decided for logistical reasons to reside in Singapore, which was the best place to&#13;
travel to, whether it was India or Australia or China, and started building the business in Asia for&#13;
JPMorgan where I had to go to Japan once a month, I had to go to New York once a month, but&#13;
basically I focused very much on developing the business in places like Korea, China, Indonesia,&#13;
and India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In '98 we had the Asian crisis, and I had some serious disagreements with our CEO at the time,&#13;
who panicked a little bit about Asia and thought we should scale down Asia. I felt very strongly&#13;
that the Asian countries would overcome the crisis relatively quickly. And since we couldn't&#13;
resolve our issues, I had actually decided to leave Morgan and do something else, and I had&#13;
started talking to a number of foundations, because I wanted to get out of the Wall Street&#13;
atmosphere and do something very different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then out of the blue, I got a phone call from a head hunter who asked me whether I would be&#13;
interested in the IFC [International Finance Corporation].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, okay. You'vejumped ahead one question, which is fine. I was going to ask&#13;
how you came to join the Bank. So this head hunter of the Bank ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I understand that--first of all, I knew the IFC a little bit because of--well, I knew the&#13;
IFC from two different instances. One was the IFC had advised the municipality of Manila on&#13;
the privatization of its water, water company. And we at Morgan at the time had advised one of&#13;
our clients who was actually bidding for the water privatization. And we had been very&#13;
impressed by thejob the IFC had done as an adviser to Manila. So I knew a little bit about the&#13;
IFC, and there was another big deal which was less fortunate than Manila. Morgan had invested&#13;
a large amount of money in the largest non-bank financial institution in Thailand, so did the IFC,&#13;
and when the crisis hit, this company went bankrupt. And Morgan and--there were lots of&#13;
commercial banks involved--but Morgan and the IFC worked very, very closely together. We&#13;
saw on most of the issues eye to eye. We at Morgan were very impressed by the professionality&#13;
of the IFC people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so when this head hunter called, you know, whether I would be interested to run the IFC, I&#13;
mean, this was sort of a gift from heaven, almost, because as I say, I wanted to do something&#13;
very different. I thought I could apply the experience I'd had in emerging markets to this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I understand that all my predecessors had come basically more or less as political appointments,&#13;
but that Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn had insisted that a professional head-hunting firm would be&#13;
hired, and that's how they came calling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: At one point I think I interviewed [Sir] William Ryrie and I guess in the British&#13;
Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And I think went back there after IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes, indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, your appointment was ajoint appointment. Or was it ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Actually a little bit later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Thejob I was hired for was exclusively as the EVP [Executive Vice President] of&#13;
the IFC, and I think it was--I started officially on January 1, 1999, and very quickly Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn asked me to work on a better integration between the Bank and the IFC. He felt that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                         5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the IFC was too far away from the Bank and vice versa and that more integration between the&#13;
two institutions was needed. And if I recall this correctly, there was a commission or a&#13;
committee which basically was made up by people from the Bank and by people from the IFC to&#13;
think about this. And I think Jim was president or chairman of the committee, and he said, you&#13;
know, "You take over as chairman."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, at that point I knew very little about the politics, et cetera, et cetera, but good friends from&#13;
outside who knew the Bank and the IFC quite well, they said to me that this committee has been&#13;
in existence for quite a while, it doesn't work unless you have--they said to me, "Unless you have&#13;
some real decision making power in the Bank, it is pretty useless, the committee work."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I went back to Jim an d told him that, and he on the spur of the moment said, "Well, then, you&#13;
should become also the Managing Director of the World Bank," which was, I think, sort of two&#13;
months later. And he put me in charge at the Bank for the infrastructure side and the private&#13;
sector development side. So that was the first time that the EVP of the IFC also was at the same&#13;
time Managing Director of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. What did you do? Did you rely on the committee? Did you create your own&#13;
committee?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I think the committee was abolished, and since I was basically, as I said, responsible&#13;
for infrastructure, we looked at certain departments or areas where the IFC and the World Bank&#13;
could work better together. And, you know, myself coming from an investment bank where the&#13;
combination of advisory services and then investments is handled, you know, through firewalls,&#13;
you have a conflict of interest officer, et cetera, et cetera, but I felt from the very beginning that&#13;
the Bank Group per se should be much more involved in advice for these governments and then&#13;
the investments could be made later on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so we created very early on what, you know, investment banks had for quite a while, a&#13;
conflict of interest group, officer, which the Bank essentially didn't have, the IFC didn't have.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then we said, "Can we combine the knowledge, the expertise which the World Bank has&#13;
when it comes to reforms for electricity, reforms for telecom, et cetera, et cetera? And can we&#13;
combine the knowledge of the IFC and the World Bank?" So we looked at a number of areas,&#13;
and we said in the area of oil, gas, and mining clearly the expertise of the Bank and the IFC&#13;
could be well combined. We looked at telecoms as well and decided the same there. And then&#13;
later on we also decided on a department for small and medium-size companies, because there&#13;
was huge demand from governments in the development of small and medium-size companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I personally at that point would have also probably included power and potentially water and&#13;
transportation, but there the resistance from the Bank, particularly from the regional vice&#13;
presidents, was particularly strong, while I had the feeling in terms of oil, gas, mining, and&#13;
telecoms they didn't care. The Bank's role wasn't that big; it had already moved to the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we decided at that point to go for the first time forjoint departments which would be headed&#13;
by ajoint director:   a director of the Bank, a director of the IFe. And as I said, we established it&#13;
for oil, gas, and mining, for SMEs [small and medium enterprises] and for telecoms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Has it worked? I think in the long run, yes, it worked because I think both groups had to make&#13;
certain concessions. As I said, in retrospect if you ask me whether this was the best thing to do, I&#13;
think at the time it probably sent some signals. Would I do it today? Most likely not, because&#13;
the interesting thing is that at the working level in the power--on the power side and water side,&#13;
the cooperation between Bank and IFe is actually very good at the working level. But&#13;
interestingly enough, I always felt the resistance to this combination didn't come from the&#13;
technicians, the working people. It came more from the senior level because people felt that they&#13;
had to give up certain things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You've anticipated one of my questions, which was: was there resistance? There's&#13;
always resistance in the Bank to any kind of change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Excuse me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One of the questions I wanted to ask is you mentioned several sectors where there&#13;
were joint efforts between the Bank and the IFe. But you didn't mention the financial markets.&#13;
Why not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, let me first start with the IFe. Financial markets for the IFe was one of the&#13;
key departments. Generally speaking, what we call building up local financial markets is, I&#13;
think, one of the key strategic purposes of the IFe. And the Financial Markets Department was&#13;
always sort of one of the biggest, the strongest, very good people, lots of expertise. If you look&#13;
back, long before I came, the IFe was involved in advising on stock exchanges in West Africa,&#13;
in Russia, et cetera, et cetera. There was always a lot of good market expertise there, and as I&#13;
said, for the IFe this was one of the key departments. And it might sound a little bit&#13;
presumptuous here perhaps, but I and several other people were never very impressed by the&#13;
Bank's expertise on the financial markets. They did have some very good people, yes, but&#13;
financial markets in my opinion were in the Bank always run too much on a regional basis. For&#13;
me, financial markets, capital markets, is the real core business where real expertise is needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When Ijoined the World Bankjust coming out of the Asian crisis, the impression of the Asian&#13;
crisis, I felt very strongly, as I said to Mr. Jim Wolfensohn at the time, that I think there would be&#13;
an enormous role for the World Bank Group in advising governments on setting up better&#13;
banking systems, on helping them getting out of the banking crisis, whether it was Indonesia,&#13;
Thailand, or whatever. And they made an effort, but it was true, regional expertise was never&#13;
global. So I have to say I was never overly impressed by the expertise which was there globally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so the IFC has always resisted sort of a ... The question was always: so what are we&#13;
gaining? You know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I sometimes wondered where we had cooperation discussions with the Fund [International&#13;
Monetary Fund] whether a combination of IFC--not joint departments necessarily, but IFC with&#13;
its deal expertise and the Fund's expertise in capital markets was probably a better combination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You said resistance in IFC was--we've talked a little bit about the resistance within&#13;
the Bank. What kind of resistance was there in IFC working more closely in these different&#13;
sectors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think, you know, there were these preconceived ideas. One thing I&#13;
consistently heard from critics in the IFC was the Bank is too slow, the Bank is too big, the Bank&#13;
is too bureaucratic. When I sort of asked people to work for us over at the Bank, very often I got&#13;
the answer, "Look, you know, we go into the meeting, there are 20 people from the Bank who sit&#13;
there for three hours, I'm alone, [inaudible] we don't have the time to do this."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think there is this perception in the IFC, which sees itself more as a deal doer, more private&#13;
sector oriented, of this sort of heavy bureaucracy. On the other hand, I think people, as I said&#13;
before, have learned to appreciate each other. I think in the area of power--whether it's in&#13;
energy, electricity, renewable energy, water particularly--I think the IFC people are recognized&#13;
as the extremely good experts in the Bank. And cooperation comes sort of more natural now&#13;
rather than forcing it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I was going to ask you about overall the success of this integration. I think&#13;
you've already touched on that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You said earlier at the beginning that you wouldn't be interested in doing this again at this point.&#13;
Could you talk a little bit more about that? Because my question is: what still needs to be done&#13;
in terms of integration? And what I think you're implying is--or maybe I'm misreading you, but-Â­&#13;
that you don't have to do more on integration or you really shouldn't be doing more on&#13;
integration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think what we tried to do five, six years ago by creating these joint&#13;
departments was sending a signal, forcing the issue. And I think I'm now at a point where I&#13;
would argue that people recognize where they need each other, and it comes natural.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If you forget about specific industries or segments of the business, if you look at the regions, I&#13;
found it always very perplexing--but I think I have an answer for that--that in an area where the&#13;
development is totally private sector-driven, in Asia, China, Southeast Asia, et cetera, et cetera,&#13;
the cooperation between the IFC and the Bank is the worst, doesn't really happen, while in an&#13;
area where the private sector is the weakest, maybe in Africa , the cooperation between IFC and&#13;
the Bank is by far better [inaudible] and in Africa it really becomes natural or is natural. And I&#13;
think the only explanation I have is that Africa is such a big challenge for both the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC that people just band together and say, "The job is so big, it's so difficult, how can we work&#13;
together here to make something happen," while in other areas--and here I want to be totally&#13;
honest with you and straightforward. I have no axe to grind. I think in regions where the private&#13;
sector is becoming more dominant for development, I think people in the Bank find it more&#13;
difficult to give up, to scale back, and hand over to the IFC. It is sort of a little bit, you know,&#13;
defending the turf, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This might sound a little bit sort of pro-IFC, but I do think--and I said this in my farewell speech&#13;
to the Board [of Executive Directors] as well--I think the Bank has to learn to be a bit faster in&#13;
reallocating resources. And for me, one of the prominent areas or regions has always been the&#13;
East European department. I think personally that it was absolutely right spot on for the Bank to,&#13;
right up to the fall of communism, to assign so many resources to Eastern Europe and Russia.&#13;
But if you look at the budget of the ECA [Europe and Central Asia] region today, it's almost as&#13;
big as it was ten years ago. There's no reason for that. And I think the Bank has to learn to&#13;
scale-ideally, I'm talking about--has to scale back more rapidly in areas where they're not&#13;
needed that much anymore, and either hand over to the IFC or even hand over. to the private&#13;
sector completely and use the resources to put them into areas where they're really needed, in&#13;
Africa or Central Asia or whatever.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think this is one of the issues which the Bank Group is going to be faced with, that there is&#13;
a decreasing demand from the middle-income countries to borrow or even take the services from&#13;
the World Bank. There's an increasing demand for the time being on the IFC. And I think&#13;
you've got to find a better balance or more rational decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, you could--you know, you could be very radical and just change the whole Articles of the&#13;
Bank and the IFC and put them completely together. I mean, the only institution which works&#13;
along these lines is the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. And if&#13;
you look at the EBRD today, the EBRD probably does 80 percent of its business with the private&#13;
sector and only 20 percent with the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I think the cultures are so ingrained in the two institutions that it would be very difficult.&#13;
The IADB [Inter-American Development Bank], by the way, has been playing around with this,&#13;
looking very much at the concept of private sector development, and one of the options they had&#13;
was to put the IIC [Inter-American Investment Corporation] and the IDB [Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank] together in one and have them work together. For practical reasons, I&#13;
understand they decided not to do this, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think it is probably easier in the long run, in the medium term, long term, sort of to&#13;
reallocate capital resources within IFC and then the IBRD. I'm not talking about IDA&#13;
[International Development Association] because IDA, I think, needs all the resources--human&#13;
and capital--it can muster because the needs in these very poor countries are enormous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Turning to the IFC, now you say that you knew something of it before you&#13;
came. Was there a time of transition between the time the head hunter found you and you took&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the job and that you began work? What I'm getting at here is: did you come into the IFC with a&#13;
set of goals or objectives?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No, 1 think that would be wrong to say 1 came in with goals and objectives. You&#13;
know, when you come to an organization, you know a little bit about an organization, but it&#13;
always takes a while that you learn everything and you know what's going on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
My exposure--I literally left Morgan, 1 think it was September of '98. 1 was invited, although 1&#13;
was not an official member yet, to participate in the World Bank meetings as an observer, IFC&#13;
meetings, et cetera, et cetera. 1 did read a lot, and 1 started unofficially 1 st of December '98 and&#13;
officially January '99.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1 remember the first talk 1 gave was that, you know, the IFC needed more capital, and I--so this&#13;
was the first thing, but 1 didn't have more--I didn't have objectives yet. 1 really wanted to learn&#13;
by seeing, by working, et cetera, et cetera. You know, it turned out right away that the IFC, at&#13;
least for the time being, doesn't need more capital, so that was a clear misunderstanding which I&#13;
had. But, you know, it's an institution where decision making is not like in the private sector. 1&#13;
was warned at the beginning, you know, don't make irrational decisions, don't judge too quickly,&#13;
and I think I followed that. And so I learned a tremendous amount the first year, and after one&#13;
year I had sort of a clearer picture of what was needed and what needed to be done. And as I&#13;
said, the second year, I wouldn't say I lost it, but the second year I didn't do enough, you know.&#13;
The big changes came in the third year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'll get to that in a second. Now, when you came into IFC, the Bank and the IFC&#13;
were still dealing with the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Exactly what was the IFC&#13;
doing when you got there in regard to the Asian crisis?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, the IFC had done one great thing and a number of not so great things in Asia.&#13;
One, they had not invested at all in Korea because Korea was rich enough, and the IFC had no&#13;
exposure in Korea whatsoever before the Asian crisis. And then the IFC moved massively into&#13;
Korea when--I think by the end of '97, early '98--when the private sector, as at JPMorgan we had&#13;
exposure in Korea, and I was told by my CEO, "Get out of Korea." And the IFC moved&#13;
massively into Korea and built up an exposure, basically in equity, by taking equity in banks and&#13;
security companies and insurance companies, about 500 million dollars. And I do think this was&#13;
one of the more brilliant moves the IFC has ever done. And it not only made us a lot of money,&#13;
but it really helped these banks who were deserted by the international correspondent banks, et&#13;
cetera, et cetera, to show the IFC had invested $50 million in their capital or $20 million. It was,&#13;
compared to their net worth, actually very small, but 1 do remember talking to a bank CEO there&#13;
who said, you know, that the IFC invested 50 million. It was remarkable for the reputation of the&#13;
Bank. So that was brilliant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What I think was--I shouldn't say less brilliant, but which was probably a mistake, that the IFC in&#13;
'95, '96, early '97, was running with the private sector and making investments in Indonesia and&#13;
Thailand, et cetera, et cetera. And I think one thing which we had going, the IFC is the best&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
contrarian investor, you know, and running with the private sector is--doesn't probably make too&#13;
much sense. And I think what we learned from the Asian crisis, when the private sector was&#13;
reinvesting heavily, it's better to step back because then we're really not leaders, and we make&#13;
not as good investments as we usually do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So during the Asian crisis, when I took over--and the Asian crisis was sort of not petering out yet&#13;
and sort of continued, but we were heavily involved in debt renegotiation with our clients in&#13;
Indonesia, in Thailand, places like that. So it was, on the one hand, reaping the benefits from the&#13;
investments in Korea, which were brilliant, and then trying to cope with the overinvestment in&#13;
Indonesia and Thailand. That's what the IFC did in '99, 2000, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, are you saying that the IFC should have become or was becoming sort of a&#13;
lender of last resort or one of the lenders of last resort in these places? Or ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. I think that the traditional business of the IFC was, as I knew it, as it was, you&#13;
know, perceived, was to accompany investments of normal companies into the emerging markets&#13;
for political protection, et cetera, et cetera. And lender of last resort was because these guys&#13;
were saying, well, "People don't lend us the money to invest in whatever, in Indonesia or in&#13;
Africa, so we rely on the IFC."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You know, the IFC was known as the project finance house in emerging markets, as I said,&#13;
protecting the investments of normal companies politically vis-a-vis the governments in these&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you've mentioned what you learned. Were you able--or did your colleagues in&#13;
the IFC learn the same lesson or ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Oh, absolutely. I think the fact I described to you about Asia, I think that was&#13;
common knowledge, that everybody said, "Yeah, perhaps we should have gone a little bit slower&#13;
when the private sector is really running, heavily investing. Perhaps that's the time when we&#13;
should go slow, withdraw, and focus on those regions or countries or areas where the private&#13;
sector isn't there." I think everybody was on board on that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. So the IFC had been looking at what I guess the IFC refers to as frontier&#13;
areas or frontier countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, no. I mean, the IFC had always a distinction between sort of middle-income&#13;
countries and frontier countries. And frontier countries were defined as probably GDP per capita&#13;
below $1,000, et cetera, et cetera. And we were always under pressure from the shareholders but&#13;
also from the stakeholders to invest more into frontier countries. And--because, I mean,&#13;
. particularly at the beginning when I took over; I think it had been going on for a while--there was&#13;
always the criticism, "Well, the IFC invests in Latin America, it invests in easy countries, you&#13;
don't tackle the difficult countries," et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so we had to ask ourselves--well, first of all, we also defined what we called frontier sectors.&#13;
You know, you can have a mid-income country, whether it is Brazil or whatever or Mexico, but&#13;
there are certain sectors where the private sector doesn't invest, you know, certain regions. You&#13;
look in Brazil, the northeast, private banks weren't investing in the northeast. We made one or&#13;
two investments in Chiapas, Mexico. Nobody was investing there. So you could define as&#13;
frontier regions in countries which were middle-income countries and easy to invest in. But you&#13;
could also define sort of frontier sectors, and one of the frontier sectors which we sort of pushed&#13;
very hard was private education and health care where the private sector wasn't investing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I think in general the focus became, because of pressure from outside, more of what can we&#13;
do in frontier countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, soon after--or how soon after you took the post at IFC did you travel? And&#13;
where did you go and why did you go to where you went?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, first of all, I did travel a lot. I think--I can't say for the whole six years, but I&#13;
think for about the last two or three years, I probably, with the exception of April and May where&#13;
we had sort of strategic meetings with the Board and budget meetings, et cetera, et cetera, and&#13;
August, which was usually when I took vacation time, I usually traveled every month. I felt very&#13;
strongly that one had to meet with clients, one had to feel--get a feel for what the clients wanted.&#13;
And travel became particularly important after I had reorganized the IFC into regional and&#13;
fundraising departments where the--we can come to this a little bit later--the issue particularly&#13;
from the regions, from the regional directors was how much support do. we get from you in what&#13;
we were supposed to do, and for me the split into regions was extremely important, and I wanted&#13;
to show my support for them. That's why I went.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But my first trips, I went in January '99 on a trip to Africa, because--very simply because I didn't&#13;
understand Africa. You know, as I told you, from my Morgan time I had lived in Asia, I had&#13;
lived in the Middle East, I had lived in Latin America. I didn't understand these regions, but I&#13;
had a feel for these regions. But I had never been, except for one brief trip to Nigeria in my&#13;
previous j ob, in Africa. I didn't understand Africa. And it was very clear that Africa was the&#13;
developmental challenge, so I went to Africa. Also, I think I followed that, I said in all the&#13;
travels I have to go at least once a year to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you've alluded to this, but how did these trips to Africa really influence your&#13;
thinking about what needed to be done at IFC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I'm not quite sure whether it influenced directly what needed to be done. One&#13;
of the things which became very clear, 1 think right from the first trip, was that if you wanted to&#13;
have any private sector development in Africa, you needed better infrastructure. I'll never forgetÂ­&#13;
-I think it was on my first trip--where 1 visited a client of the IFC, a textile company in Kenya,&#13;
where the loan was slowly but surely going sour. I met with the owner, and he said, "You know,&#13;
Peter, some years ago we were competitive with Asia, but 1 can't compete anymore because the&#13;
electricity goes down three times a day and resetting the weaving and spinning machines takes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                        12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
two days. So," he said, "just because of that I can't compete anymore." And so I got so very&#13;
interested in, you know, how can one get better infrastructure for Africa. That was one thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing was I felt--not only in Africa, but particularly in Africa--the overwhelming&#13;
demand from governments on SME development. I was struck that if not the first, the second&#13;
question from any government official, whether it was the finance minister or prime minister,&#13;
was always, "How can IFC help us on the development of SMEs?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And in Africa that's particularly important because you have hardly any big companies. You&#13;
have some big multinationals like the Heinekens of this world, but you have hardly any big&#13;
companies, and it's all SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think Africa did two things that--they focused--you know, I came to focus on the importance&#13;
of infrastructure and another focus on the importance of SMEs. That's what Africa taught me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: The third one which sort of more generally came was--and this is a completely new&#13;
subject. When I joined the IFC, coming from Wall Street, I was struck, shocked I have to say,&#13;
about the lack of client focus by the IFC. And my colleagues always got a little upset, but, you&#13;
know, I think I was right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The IFC, I found, was a Washington-centric organization which basically had the attitude,&#13;
"Show me your project; we'll decide in Washington whether to finance it." And there were big&#13;
complaints about, you know, the length of time it took. And I mentioned it a few times, and--but&#13;
there were so many small, little things which made me aware of the lack of client focus. One&#13;
example: I told my assistant, my executive assistant early on, I said, "If I'm in a meeting and it's&#13;
internal and a client calis, you interrupt me." I think I had to tell her that for three years. "It's&#13;
not an important meeting," I said. "Internal meetings are unimportant when a client calls."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I traveled a lot. I met clients. And then I was struck in my first year that I never saw a client in&#13;
Washington. And I said to the departments, I said, "Look, this is very strange. I have not met&#13;
clients, but surely they come and visit you."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Yeah, yeah, they come, but you're too senior to see them." You know?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, this was totally in contrast to what I had done on Wall Street. I mean, my job in running&#13;
Asia for JPMorgan, I suffered from the fact that I constantly got phone calls from India,&#13;
Australia or Japan or China: "We need you here. We've got to make a client presentation; we&#13;
want you here to sell JPMorgan." And that never happened at the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The heavy relational emphasis on the private sector was between clients and banks,&#13;
but that's not the case at IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I wouldn't--the relation was--it was sort of the other way around. In Wall&#13;
Street, the senior guys are heavily involved in client building. In the IFC it was all the junior&#13;
guys. We had a retreat--I think it was the oil department--where two very senior guys from BP&#13;
[British Petroleum] were invited to give the oil department feedback on how they felt about the&#13;
IFC and the relationship. And it was the usual, you know: "Able people, very good people, very&#13;
good on projects," et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But one of the things the guy said was-which I had not expected, he said, "The big difference&#13;
between investment banks and the IFC is that we only deal with junior people here. Your senior&#13;
people don't know what's going on; they're totally aloof, you know?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "You know, the directors of the departments have to get involved with the clients."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
That was one thing. This was sort of the more general thing to focus. on, but the other thing&#13;
which--and this is i!l respect to the frontier countries--I said to my guys, "Okay, in Africa, we&#13;
don't have enough private sector development. Why don't you talk to some clients with whom&#13;
we have done great business in Brazil or in Argentina or in Mexico or in Bulgaria, you know?&#13;
'Here's a market called Nigeria, South Africa. Why don't you go with us? We'll coordinate with&#13;
     , ,,&#13;
you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"No, no, no, we can't do this."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Why can't you do this?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"IFC should never get involved in promoting projects."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Why not?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Well, no, this is not our role, and the liabilities, and you know."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Look, guys, I mean, there's work in these difficult countries. We have to get&#13;
involved in project--not design, but in project development."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think this all came to a head sort of in--I think in 2001, 2002, when we realized that&#13;
actually the revenues of the IFC weren't growing anymore. They petered out, stabilized, you&#13;
know, and our costs were still going up. Now, you could make the argument perhaps we were&#13;
not cost efficient. But a lot of the costs, when we analyzed it, were due to the fact that we had&#13;
growth in the past. If you look back on, you know, when Ryrie was head, the IFC was run like a&#13;
partnership. It was small, it did a good job, but you didn't have a back office, you didn't have&#13;
portfolio management, you didn't have risk analysis, you didn't have a big environmental and&#13;
social department. All that was built sort of in the late '90s, which had pushed up the costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so you had the classic case where the revenues were like this [he gestures with his hands]&#13;
and the costs were going like this, and you could see where they would meet, you know. And we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
said--at this point, we started thinking about this development--we said, "Either there isn't&#13;
enough business in these poor countries or the private sector for the IFC, and we had reached a&#13;
plateau--then we have to do something about the costs--or we're not finding enough business,&#13;
and we have to become more client-focused." And we decided that we, you know, would go and&#13;
find clients. But that meant become client-focused, go out to the clients, get involved in project&#13;
development, et cetera, et cetera. That's what we started to do, and that has worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me ask, just going back to things that you began to emphasize in your own mind&#13;
after spending more time in Africa. The Bank under Wolfensohn became very interested in&#13;
issues of corruption, and it seems to me that one of the areas where corruption would be rife&#13;
would be in the private sector. So did the IFC get heavily involved in issues of corruption?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. I mean, we had to, anyway, because all the loan documents which we did&#13;
stipulated that loans or equity involvements would be callable if we discovered any corruption.&#13;
So we had, clearly, discussions with our clients where we designed the financing that corruption&#13;
on all parts would not be tolerated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. But did you still think that corruption was a problem? I mean, did you run&#13;
into problems in projects in Africa?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, we had one--yeah, I ran into a corruption problem which was extremely&#13;
unfortunate. We were--IFC and the Bank also--we got very involved in a hydro p oject, hydro&#13;
plant in Uganda, which was a $400 million project to produce 200 megawatts for Uganda,&#13;
desperately needed electricity. The project was complex because there were environmental and&#13;
social issues. The NGOs were very much--not all of them--but some of the radical NGOs were&#13;
very much opposed to the project. There were arguments about the economics of the project.&#13;
And so it was slow process to get this project done. There was no question that Uganda&#13;
desperately needed the electricity because the country is totally underserved, the schools and&#13;
hospitals, and people are suffering from this tremendously. So the need was there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But to get the project done was very, very slow, and then we heard that a subcontractor of the&#13;
main contractor--the main contractor AES Corporation--subcontractors had paid a bribe to a&#13;
Ugandan Government official, and we had to stop the work because we investigated it first, and&#13;
then we had to give the information to the respective authorities to look into this because-as I&#13;
said, AES was not involved; it was a subcontractor--to the U.S. authorities, we had to give it to&#13;
the Nordics because the subcontractor was a Nordic company. We had to give it to the u.K.&#13;
authorities because the bribe apparently was paid through the U.K. situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And here--and I want to be very clear. I'm totally against corruption, but here we're talking about&#13;
a bribe of about $15,000. This thing held up the whole project for a year. We couldn't do any&#13;
work on it. And in the end, because of the constant delays, the cost of this thing had become so&#13;
big because of corruption investigation and AES Corporation, which also faced some problems&#13;
at the time, financial problems here, threw in the towel and gave up on the project.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We had intense discussions with the governments there on this corruption issue, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera, and my only reaction was here are millions of people suffering from not having&#13;
electricity, and for a lousy 15 thousand bucks, you know, you've basically killed this important&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did this end being cautionary in other parts of Africa? Was there a lot of publicity&#13;
about the problem?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: On this one?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. This was widely discussed. But, I mean, the whole corruption issue in&#13;
Africa is in a way a sad one. It's not just in Africa. You know, part of the problem which I think&#13;
the donors have to deal with eventually is how civil servants get paid. It's not just that people-Â­&#13;
you know, when ministers get paid five or six or seven hundred dollars, which we have&#13;
witnessed in a number of countries, it's not only that you don't get the best people to work for&#13;
governments but you also make them very susceptible to corruption. I think some of the donors&#13;
have to get together at some point and say, "If these countries really want to make progress, at&#13;
least the elite of the politicians, you know, the ministers, the permanent secretaries, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera, have to get paid--no matter what the fiscal situation is in these countries--have to get paid&#13;
an amount which makes them less vulnerable to corruptive practices."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I also emphasize about corruption, that's what we told the private sector companies. I mean,&#13;
there were two parts to that, you know. And I think we're seeing--we're making some progress&#13;
here. I think there are an increasing number of companies who clearly say that they're not paying&#13;
and they do business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, we have one company which has been exceedingly successful, exclusively in Africa,&#13;
which is called Celtel. We gave them an award last year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: They have basically built several phone systems in some of the toughest&#13;
environments in Africa, very successful company. And they live on the ethics; they say they&#13;
never paid one dollar bribe in Africa. And they're successful. And I think we see more. So I&#13;
think it is--on both ends you have to tell the private sector, you know, it doesn't pay in the long&#13;
run to bribe. It increases your own costs. And I think you have to do something with the civil&#13;
servants so that they get, you know, decent money [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: At one time the Bank put a lot of emphasis on developing civil service. I think&#13;
they've done a lot in Latin America on that. I don't know if that's received the kind of emphasis&#13;
in the last ten years that it had received in, you know, the ten years before.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, you mentioned that your third year was the year that you really hit the ground in the IFC.&#13;
Could you talk a little bit about the third year?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, you know, a number of things came together. I had--well, first of all, we had&#13;
agreed that we needed more client focus. Secondly, we had recognized that the future business&#13;
was not going to come in the traditional way--i.e., as financing projects for companies from the&#13;
North in the South--for two reasons. One was--and I met with a number of big international&#13;
companies and said, "We're not doing any business with you. Why is this?" And they were&#13;
saying, "Well, first of all, if we decide to go to China today or to Russia, we don't need the IFC&#13;
anymore. We have our own risk management, and we have surveyed the market, and we don't"-Â­&#13;
this was 20 years ago, 15 years ago--"We don't need the IFC anymore."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, interestingly, because of globalization, they said, "Yes, we're investing in these&#13;
countries, but we are not investing that much anymore." If you look at the big consumer&#13;
companies or the big, you know, electricity companies, whatever, they're saying we're&#13;
increasingly looking for sourcing from these countries. I mean, one company which made it&#13;
very clear to me was Siemens in Germany, a huge company. They said, "Look, when we go to&#13;
China or go to Russia, the most important thing for us is the sourcing from the local companies&#13;
because we want cheap sourcing."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And so we said, "Ah, here is the new opportunity for the IFC. It is not anymore that&#13;
Siemens or GE which needs us, but it is those local companies there which don't have access to&#13;
the market, which don't get money from the international banks. The local banks are not&#13;
sophisticated yet enough, so why don't we focus on these institutions?" So that sort of&#13;
crystallized itself, but for that reason we have to work differently. We have to have people on&#13;
the front.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then I had started discussions with some people and said, "Look, we better move to Hong&#13;
Kong, or we've got to move to Beijing or to Moscow or Istanbul." And there was a lot of&#13;
resistance in the IFC because people like Washington. They like the schools, and they like the&#13;
family life here, et cetera, et cetera, and so there was some resistance. I remember a meeting&#13;
which I had with one of the groups where we had discussed establishing a major office in Asia,&#13;
and the people said to me, literally, "Unless you do it in Singapore, we won't go." And I got&#13;
very upset about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Not even Hong Kong?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, Hong Kong was not the issue. Hong Kong was too expensive. I was in&#13;
Beijing and had talked to the Chinese Government about whether we should do our East Asian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
office in Beijing or in Shanghai,and they said,to my big surprise,"No,no,we want it in Hong&#13;
Kong."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well,that's nice and dandy,but Hong Kong we cannot afford. It's too expensive."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Chinese Government said, "We'll pay for the office," which was quite interesting. And&#13;
Beijing is paying for the office in Hong Kong. And the reason why they wanted Hong Kong&#13;
rather than Shanghai is,they said, "This is going to be a regional office which will cover&#13;
Indonesia,Thailand and all of these other places,and for that Hong Kong is in a better position&#13;
than Shanghai," which was very interesting. But at that point,it was not Singapore or Hong&#13;
Kong,it was Beijing or Shanghai.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then Argentina happened,and Argentina now was our biggest exposure. We had over $1.2&#13;
billion there. And since the IFC,unlike the World Bank,we have to put up reserves like any&#13;
commercial bank,we had to reserve, I think it was,slightly over $600 million immediately. It&#13;
was very clear that could sort of tank the IFC for the first time--not tank it,but the IFC would&#13;
show,potentially, the first loss ever in its history because of this huge financial earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This is a classic case where the CEO takes advantage of a situation. I wrote a memo and eÂ­&#13;
mailed it to all of the staff,and I said,"Look,this could be the first loss in the history of the IFC.&#13;
We always pride ourselves that we behave like private sector, and so let's act like private sector&#13;
at this time."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I basically decided that we should,in that particular year,cut costs,which we did. We let 120&#13;
people go--the first time in the history. And I said, "We have to reorganize ourselves,and we&#13;
will put all of our regional directors and the senior staff into the hubs between these places." A&#13;
little bit of the fear -of God was there,and everybody was happy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now,the interesting thing was that people who I had to sort of push a little bit to go to places&#13;
like Hong Kong or Moscow or Istanbul or Delhi,whatever it was,they were reluctant,but my&#13;
experience was always after six months they came back for a visit and said, "You did the right&#13;
thing. It is so much more fun out there. We have the daily client contact. We have the contact&#13;
with the government. It's not just navel gazing like in Washington. It's great to be out there."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And so the news spread around, and coming back,they said, "Why was I opposing this so&#13;
much?" I also wanted to support the regional directors. I mean, we made it very clear that the&#13;
regional directors and their staff were responsible now to all clients,were responsible for the&#13;
strategy in their regions, and that the Global Industry Department basically had to deliver that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What year was this? This was your third year,so it would be ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: That was the third,yes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me ask you what is the makeup of staff at IFe? Is it broad-based? Is it the Bank&#13;
itself or is there a heavier emphasis on what I would call Anglo-Americans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: You know, I don't know whether it is heavy on Anglo-Americans. The difference&#13;
between the staff of the World Bank and the IFe is the young people which we take in for&#13;
investment officers, et cetera, et cetera, they tend to be, I would say, 80 to 90 percent MBAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: MBAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes. The Bank takes more ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Ph.D.s ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: ..Ph.D.s and economists, et cetera, et cetera. So our people tend to be more MBAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have emphasized a lot diversity. So we have gone--we were heavily criticized for just&#13;
recruiting from the Whartons [Wharton, University of Pennsylvania], the Harvards, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera. So we have gone and recruited our people from universities in South Africa, in Asia, et&#13;
cetera, et cetera, although I have to say the very good, the top universities, still make it relatively&#13;
easy because they have diversified ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: . and you get now absolutely outstanding people--Indonesians, Africans, et cetera,&#13;
               .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
et cetera--from Harvard, Wharton or wherever they are recruiting the staff. But we have&#13;
diversified the universities. You know, I could push that easily because I have said, "You know,&#13;
graduating from Saarbrucken, I would have never been accepted at the World Bank nor would I&#13;
be successful in life." So I think it's more diversified. I think it's not any more AngloÂ­&#13;
Americans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The interesting thing, however--and we are always very open about this--we still have slight&#13;
problems with Part 2 countries going abroad. Europeans or Americans, who join the IFe, joined&#13;
the IFe in order to go abroad, more or less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Part 2 countries want to come to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And it's quite interesting. I mean, it's now changing as well. We have some terrific&#13;
Africans who decided not to go back to Africa, et cetera, but it was a little bit more difficult. As&#13;
I said, I think, psychologically, Americans and Europeans join to go abroad. They [Part 2] want&#13;
to leave their terrible countries, come here and ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Make their career here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What about hiring people from Wall Street? The issue, of course, would be the comparative&#13;
salaries, I guess. But did you make an effort to hire experienced Wall Street people from IFC,&#13;
aside from yourself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: That's an interesting question because if you had asked me what would you do&#13;
differently today if you took over the IFC again, I probably--the answer to your question is, no,&#13;
not enough. I probably should have hired the first year, the first or second year, three, four, five,&#13;
six mid-career, higher career people from outside, not necessarily Wall Street, but from outside&#13;
and brought them in at sort of Director level, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The IFC is extremely sort of building up from ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Bottom up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: . bottom up. I come from a culture at JPMorgan where that was the case until&#13;
               .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1990, '91, '92, until everything globalized, and we had put more emphasis on investment&#13;
banking, and we had to hire people from outside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think this culture of bottom up is a good one, but I think the IFC is still too much internally&#13;
focused, and I think three or four people from outside could have done, would have helped me in&#13;
changing the place. There is almost animosity against people from outside. I mean, not that they&#13;
resented the EVP because the EVP came from outside ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: ..but at the lower level. Two years ago we wanted to fill the head of Capital&#13;
Markets, which is one of the biggest and most important departments here, and I said, "We have&#13;
to find someone from outside because the importance of knowing the markets."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tAnd we found a very good person, and he said at the end--you know, we had made the decision a&#13;
Iyear before I left--and he said, "What are the chances that you'll stay longer?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Not very big."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Then I won't come."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Why won't you come?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Peter, this place is so hostile that you have to support me over the next three, four, five&#13;
years here."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There was an attitude that the head of Capital Markets has to come from inside. It's amazing. So&#13;
I think to get the IFC more outward focused, I think it's important to have a few people from&#13;
outside. You don't want to destroy the culture of bottom up, which is great, but I think there's&#13;
too much an attitude, "If it's not grown in the IFC, it's no good."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in this third year, what else were you doing? There was the reorganization.&#13;
There was trying to change the emphasis on client focuses. In effect, you're saying there is a&#13;
decentralization and that you're moving people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What else was happening?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think that was a big one because people have told me the reorganization&#13;
which we were going through was so massive, it was one of the biggest reorganizations ever.&#13;
The biggest surprise--I think by everybody, even for me--was how well it worked. I think there&#13;
is--again, I said this to my colleagues in my last town hall meeting--there is a perception among&#13;
the people themselves, I mean I found it always interesting that people said to me, "Oh, my God,&#13;
no more change, no more change, right?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I always said, "Look, the world is changing rapidly around us. We constantly have to&#13;
change. We have to adapt, and we had this reorganization."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They said, "Hopefully, this will be the last reorganization for the next five years."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Rubbish. We won't have a major reorganization, but we have to tweak and adapt it."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There's a perception, you know, that people are relatively conservative, not the biggest riskÂ­&#13;
takers--this is not negatively meant--but there is this attitude. But I actually think the IFC people&#13;
are much more flexible than they think. The reorganization worked beautifully. We couldn't&#13;
recognize it, and within 6 to 12 months revenues took off. The focus on local companies paid off&#13;
tremendously. We're in demand. Profits turned up to be, you know, became record profits in the&#13;
history of the IFC. Everything worked. And I think it is, basically, that people are much more&#13;
flexible than they think they are.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me, if I may--do you want to take a break?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No, no. I'm fine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me tum to some other issues that I, in my research, I've found interesting and&#13;
important. The emphasis on sustainability--I've read a lot of your speeches and you said at&#13;
Harvard Business School that sustainability is a very fuzzy concept and very difficult to define.&#13;
Now, this must have been early in your time, while you were still defining what you meant by&#13;
sustainability, but could you talk a little bit about how the emphasis on that came about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                       21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: When I joined the IFC, one of the things which surprised me, I mean, I looked at the&#13;
organization, right, and there was this Environmental Social Department. I met with the head&#13;
who was an engineer, a great guy. I said there were 50; I think I counted 50 or 52 experts:&#13;
environmental, social experts, anthropologists, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And coming from Wall Street, where the only NOOs [non-governmental organizations] I had&#13;
met were at shareholders' meetings at lPMorgan (usually it was the churches who blasted us for&#13;
not forgiving debt in Latin America), that was the only time I had met with NOOs. That was in&#13;
the '90s. So I came here, and I said, "What on earth are these environmentalists doing here?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then the investment officers told me, "Well, you know, you have to understand we have&#13;
these safeguards." I did not know exactly what the safeguards were. They were imposed by the&#13;
NOOs, and the World Bank and the IFC, and the attitude was, "You know, we have these great&#13;
projects, but then, unfortunately, we have to tell the sponsor that in order to get the money from&#13;
the IFC, they have to make a few extra investments in less emissions, compensation for local&#13;
people who got affected by the projects." The attitude was a little bit, you know, "It's too bad&#13;
because we have these safeguards, and therefore our clients have to be told they have to make&#13;
some extra investments."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I looked at this, and I was very practical in that respect. I remembered that at lPMorgan I was in&#13;
the executive management committee, where we met every month for 2 days, 12 people, 12&#13;
managers. Literally, one day we spent on competitive issues: how can we beat Ooldman Sachs&#13;
or Morgan Stanley and the like? In the end, we never found a silver bullet except work a little&#13;
bit harder, be a little bit more innovative, but no silver bullet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "But isn't this a huge advantage if none of the others have this expertise?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I met with these guys, and they were experts, real experts, and they were passionate about it.&#13;
There was one guy who was Canadian who was I think superb, you know, very business-minded.&#13;
A lot of the stuff which they found is not extra investments, but you can save money if you&#13;
insulate your pipes and things like that, how to avoid wasting water, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "If we really have these experts, isn't this an economic advantage which you have,&#13;
perhaps not even vis-a-vis the private sector, but vis-a-vis the EBRD, the other multilaterals? If&#13;
we really can sell this to our clients as a value added rather than as an extra cost, right, then we&#13;
have made it."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I talked to a number of people in the IFC about this, and some people got really excited about&#13;
this. And we said, "Well, it means that we have to approach our investments or projects&#13;
differently. We should not look at projects any more as 'done' from a financial point of view&#13;
and then step back and say, 'Oh, by the way, you've got to put in some special scrubbers here&#13;
and do a little bit there.' If we say the project is defined differently from the very beginning,&#13;
which takes this into consideration, then perhaps it helps in the long run to push up profitability."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we started the process in the IFC, and we called it sustainability. I always like the word&#13;
corporate social responsibility . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, I was going to ask about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: .. but we called it sustainability. And there was a lot of resistance among the&#13;
investment officers. And we didn't sort of say, "This is the way we do it," but we had breakfast&#13;
meetings. We met with sort of three or four of us who were convinced that this was good and&#13;
was competitive and important; we met with 20 people in the morning for breakfast for one and&#13;
half hours. I would talk about these issues and try to convince people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, again, a mishap helped. We at the IFC had financed a gold mine in Peru in '93. IFC has&#13;
an equity participation in it. The IFC had done a great job in '93 because they had helped the&#13;
Peruvian Government design the mining law, et cetera, et cetera. So there was involvement with&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But then towards the end of 2000, they had a terrible accident whereby one of the trucks lost&#13;
some mercury. And the Indios--it's in a very remote area of the Andes--thought this was silver.&#13;
They picked up the mercury, and a thousand people got very, very sick. The company reacted&#13;
very well. They sent down a team of doctors, and people were treated. So that was done well,&#13;
and IFC sent people there. It was all handled very well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But out of this accident developed a hostility by the local community against this project, and so&#13;
the people started asking, you know, "This is what always happens: the water is poisoned; the&#13;
foreigners are extracting the gold, shipping it away; we don't have any advantages from it," et&#13;
cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, we discovered that the mining law, which we had helped to design, had actually stipulated&#13;
that 20 percent of the royalties of the taxes which the Federal Government was getting from the&#13;
projects had to be channeled back into the local community. Guess what? It never happened.&#13;
They never sent any money back to these folks. So except for a few employments, the local&#13;
community actually didn't get anything out this whole thing, but they thought that their water&#13;
was contaminated, et cetera, et cetera. So this whole thing escalated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And one day my public relations guy came to me and said, "Peter, something awful has&#13;
happened."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What happened?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oxfam has done a movie on the Y anacocha mine, and it shows--the IFC is mentioned&#13;
and what a terrible project it is and the poor people get exploited, et cetera, et cetera. It's a&#13;
terrible movie, and," he said, "even worse, it will be shown in one of the movie theaters in D.C."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Give me the movie." I looked at it that evening.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The next morning I called every investment officer who was in Washington into the auditorium.&#13;
I said, "You better see this for yourself." I said, "You are going to see this movie. I won't make&#13;
any comments, and after the movie I will talk to you."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And they looked at this movie, and they were, of course, all horrified. And I said, "This is why&#13;
corporate social responsibility is important. We have been talking about this now for half a year&#13;
or a year. This is why this is competitive advantage. If we do projects where the local&#13;
community gets benefits from, we are producing better projects."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The interesting thing--I mean, this is nothing about charity--was that the mine threw out their&#13;
local management and said, "Put in new management." They said--and things were already very&#13;
bad--they said, "This is a mine which we'll have around for 35 years. It is the lowest-cost gold&#13;
producer in the world, highly profitable. We cannot afford to have a hostile local community&#13;
there." So they told the new management, "You do everything to pacify the local community, to&#13;
make them happier, et cetera, et cetera."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, we had to work with this for two years because things were really bad. We mediated. We&#13;
are now advising the local community how to--they're getting good money, though--how to&#13;
spend the money, et cetera, et cetera. But that was sort of a major shift on this whole&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What year was this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: This happened at the end of 2000, and then we worked on 2001 on it, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think we're now in a situation where--and then what happened afterward, the industry&#13;
director said, "Well, perhaps this is a good thing."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then we said, "Rather than having an Environmental Department, which acts sort of as a&#13;
police on what we're doing, why don't we mainstream this whole thing, bring the experts into the&#13;
department?" So that was a big break.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think in that respect we were right--I was right--because if you look at all of the&#13;
multilaterals today, the IFC is seen as the expert on these issues. You know, we're better than&#13;
EBRD, we're better than ADB [Asian Development Bank], et cetera, et cetera. They all relied on&#13;
the expertise of the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing which is absolutely fascinating for me is that in the poorer countries, in the&#13;
developing countries, the local private companies are buying into this very heavily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was going to be my question: what about the clients?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, you know, the international mining companies have boughti nto it because,&#13;
again, they're under pressure from the stakeholders and NGOs. The oil companies--you know, it&#13;
depends on whether you talk to BP and Shell--they make a big fuss about this. But the real&#13;
changes taking place in India today are with the local companies or, in Brazil, with the local&#13;
compames.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And it is fascinating. When you talk to Brazilian companies where corporate social&#13;
responsibility is really the agenda for theCEOs, and you ask theCEOs, "What is the change&#13;
here?" they are saying, "The totally unhealthy distribution of equity in our country, you know,&#13;
where a small elite owns 90 percent of the equity ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Everything.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: ..is probably the reason why capital markets are so volatile." This is literally what&#13;
CEOs have told me. They say, "The capital markets are not dumb. They recognize there is a&#13;
risk in this unequal distribution, and therefore the capital costs for Brazil is always going to be&#13;
too high for us to compete. The government has never been able to do something really about&#13;
this, but we have management expertise. We can do certain things. We can change the attitude."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And you see this in Brazilian companies today. You see it in Indian companies. You see it in&#13;
Chinese private companies. There is a recognition that corporate social responsibility is helping&#13;
long term their viability, their profits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I was quite intrigued--I don't know whether you followed what happened atCitibank recently&#13;
because of the problems they had in Japan, where Japan ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: . they had trouble with their private banking. I mean, Chuck [Charles 0.] Prince,&#13;
               .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the newCEO, has gone with a huge corporate social responsibility program in front of&#13;
everybody atCitibank, 300,000 people, and he consulted--this is what the Wall Street Journal&#13;
said--that he consulted with a number ofCEOs in the U.S., amongst others the guy from Johnson&#13;
&amp; Johnson. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the few companies in this country which says&#13;
shareholder has to come third: the first one is client, the second one is employees and third is the&#13;
shareholder, but we are improving shareholder value in the long term by paying close attention to&#13;
the clients and to the employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think this is something which is really taking place in the enlightened sort of private-sector&#13;
companies in the developing world. Sol think this whole issue of corporate social responsibility&#13;
or sustainability has been a mammoth boost for the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what about the--related to this is the so-called Equator Principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Could you talk a little bit about that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: That was quite fascinating. When I joined the IFC,I had my first meeting with the&#13;
NOOs,and the first thing they told me, "Well,you know,you come from Wall Street. You have&#13;
to go back to Wall Street now because of the IFC safeguards,all of the banks have to take them&#13;
on."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Now,wait a minute,guys. This is too early. I'm learning this whole thing and,by&#13;
the way,don't pressure me. You can go to the banks," et cetera,et cetera. We had discussions&#13;
about this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then--I'm mixing this up now,I think, two or three years,of my EVP-ship at the IFC--I got a&#13;
phone call from ABN-AMRO and Citibank,and they said they wanted to come to Washington&#13;
and talk to us about our experience with the safeguards. I mean,whenever we had done the&#13;
loans,syndications,you know,the projects had to be under our safeguards. And I said, "What&#13;
do you mean?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Well,we want to really hear from you specifically what the problems are with the safeguards,"&#13;
et cetera,et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we finally arranged for a meeting in London,where we met six or seven big banks,but it was&#13;
under the leadership ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Around when was this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
\WOICKE: The Equator Principles were,I think,passed two years ago?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Two.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I think so,and this was a year earlier. And we had a workshop there which was&#13;
really led by maybe AMRO,Citibank and Barclays at the time,and three or four other banks as&#13;
well,and we had four or five from IFC. And the workshop lasted five,six hours,and we literally&#13;
talked,made presentations on the safeguards,what the safeguards were, the problems with the&#13;
safeguards,the issues,et cetera,et cetera. I talked about my favorite subject at that point-Â­&#13;
corporate social responsibility--et cetera,et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And after five hours,they said, "Very interesting, thank you very much," and then we didn't&#13;
hear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then three or four months later,the same banks called up again and said, "We want to have&#13;
another workshop."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said,"Well,that's about?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                       26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And they said,"Well,we have decided to adopt safeguards,but we still have lots of questions&#13;
and issues. This is a big thing."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then we had another workshop and then,again,the leadership of Citi, AMRO and Barclays.&#13;
They decided to move ahead and adopt safeguards for their banks,literally, just for project&#13;
finance,for projects over $50 million; And I said,"My God,this is something really big here."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then the question came up,there was a debate among those banks,"Well,do we have a&#13;
disadvantage if we adopt them,but the other banks don't? Can the other banks have the&#13;
competitive advantage if they don't insist on these safeguards," et cetera, et cetera. One of the&#13;
banks said loud and clear,"If you guys are hesitant to do this,we have decided to move ahead&#13;
because we don't see this just from the risk point of view,but we see this as a competitive&#13;
advantage." That sounded great.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then there was the momentum. I think originally eight or nine banks adopted them,and&#13;
very quickly it was up to 22 or 23 banks,and it was clear that big projects could not be financed&#13;
any more without having adopted these safeguards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We're back on,and we're talking about the Equator Principles and the whole idea of&#13;
how this starts with six or seven banks,you say,and ultimately moves up to twenty-two and&#13;
beyond. So I'm sorry to have interrupted. You were going to say some more about this,about&#13;
why the banks bought into this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOlKE: I think banks came from two different angles. One or two of the banks came and saw&#13;
this as a competitive advantage. Now,they said, "No,even if we require our clients to make&#13;
these special investments for social or environmental reasons,if we have the expertise,that's&#13;
competitive advantage."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
That was great foresight, in my opinion, but I think generally the banks came from a risk&#13;
management point of view. They said,"When we finance,we have financial risk,but clearly in&#13;
developing countries where we can rely on legislation,we don't have only financial risk, we have&#13;
environmental risk." Some of the banks had financed some awful projects in Indonesia or in&#13;
other countries,and the NGOs were knocking at their doors. Well, it was not just the NGOs. I&#13;
mean,several clients got upset,et cetera,et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think the bulk of the banks--and this is not criticizing; I think it's the right attitude--came&#13;
from a strictly risk-management point of view and only did they see this as a,you know, youÂ­&#13;
can't-do-without-it-any-more competitive advantage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:       I'm sorry to stop you again. I want to make sure that I'm not ...&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, how was this, the Equator Principles, how were these received by, well,&#13;
potential, other clients or--I want to tum a little bit to the NGOs and some of the issues there.&#13;
How was this received?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE:      1 think the reception by clients of the banks--I mean, you should ask the banks&#13;
themselves--but 1 think some of the banks it was received well. 1 heard some of the clients told&#13;
the banks, "Well, look, this is a matter for development banks, but you should be just&#13;
commercial." But 1 think it's so well established today that there is no doubt about it. 1 think&#13;
there is this increased recognition today by the private sector that shareholder value is important,&#13;
but if it's only short term oriented, it's no good for your long term profits. So 1 think it's accepted&#13;
today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have experience in IFC with Exxon, where we were involved with Chad/Cameroon. Exxon&#13;
is the classical engineering company who pretends that they don't think very highly about&#13;
corporate social responsibility, so we had to push them very hard. But once they have accepted&#13;
those sort of things, they do it perfectly. They make decisions that I think they have done a great&#13;
job in Chad/Cameroon with the social and environmental side. I gave a talk to the Exxon&#13;
financial people, where it was very interesting that the older guys were very skeptical and the&#13;
young people where I gave a speech in Houston, they said, ','We have to take these things much&#13;
more seriously." So I think there is some movement in this direction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think the next step, really--you know, I have always said the banks are done. The big thing is&#13;
now how do you move the big investors, the pension funds, et cetera, et cetera, because one of&#13;
the things which we learned--at IFC we organized a lot of these (not a lot, but a few)&#13;
sustainability conferences where we had clients who took this seriously talk to our other clients.&#13;
I'll never forget we had a sustainability conference in Hong Kong, where one of our lead&#13;
Indonesian companies was giving a big presentation on what they were doing in terms of&#13;
corporate social responsibility. But the CEO said, "Look, the problem is with this audience. I'll&#13;
                                                                 t his sort of thing." So it's&#13;
also meet my two equity analysts, and they don't give a damn about&#13;
not the equity analysts, but I think it is convincing the big institutional investors that corporate&#13;
social responsibility by companies they invest in is long term profit investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It's interesting that, I mean, in the U.S., of course, the rules of fiduciary&#13;
responsibility for the pension funds, 1 mean, they tend to be very short term in their . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes. The other day I was at a seminar which I took for company directors, which is&#13;
run by Chicago, Wharton and Stanford. It was in Stanford, and we had a section on corporate&#13;
finance. And the guy from Chicago basically was, "Shareholder value, shareholder value,&#13;
shareholder value," and we had a big debate about this. My sense was the majority--there were&#13;
about 40 people in the seminar--the majority of the people clearly are moving away from this just&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
short term shareholder orientation and say, "We all need long term investors, and in that respect&#13;
we have to pay attention to these things."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well,honestly,that's one of the most encouraging things I've heard in a while. I&#13;
mean,from your vantage point where you know a lot of these people,because the academic&#13;
literature on this seems to still be pushing,especially the people who teach finance tend to be ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes,but I think it is changing. As I said,I think this guy from Chicago,this&#13;
professor,was clearly very much what these companies should focus on was shareholder value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And then we had ajudge from Delaware court talking and, my God, he ripped him&#13;
apart,basically. He said,"This is shareholder value destroying,what you're teaching." In the&#13;
long term,companies have to be serious. If you look at the stockholders of Johnson &amp; Johnson,&#13;
you know,this company is this--first clients,then the employees, and then shareholder value,and&#13;
the stock performance of Johnson &amp; Johnson is terrific.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. I want to tum to a couple of other things,move away a little bit from the IFC,&#13;
per se,for a minute and get back to your Managing Director position. We talked about what you&#13;
were faced with at the very beginning, but you remained a Managing Director throughout your&#13;
entire time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What other issues,responsibilities,problems arose as being a Managing Director?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well,here,things become a little bit more sensitive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well,as I said,it is up to you later on to take a look at this,but ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I think,you know,during most of my time--I mean,we had a number of Managing&#13;
Directors. And it was first Caio [K.] Koch-Weser who left,and then Sven Sandstrom left,and&#13;
then came Dr. Mamphela Remphele from South Africa; Jeff [Jeffrey A.] Goldsteinjoined. The&#13;
core of the Managing Directors after Sven left were basically sort of Jeff Goldstein, Mamphela,&#13;
Shengman Zhang,myself and the President. So this group of five were sort of the senior&#13;
management group of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I always felt that the role of the Managing Directors was not very well defined. That has always&#13;
been my complaint. I am not saying this behind the back of Jim Wolfensohn. He knows it&#13;
because I complained to him myself on this. We had a retreat with Wolfensohn,what was it,&#13;
one-and-a-half-years ago,just the four Managing Directors and him,where he said, "Look,I'm&#13;
disappointed. You guys are managing the Bank. You're not doing yourjob as senior managers,"&#13;
et cetera,et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                          29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And we were a little bit stunned, and I said, "Look, Jim, I have two roles here. I am the EVP of&#13;
the IFC, and I am Managing Director of the World Bank. When it comes to the IFC, I am totally&#13;
accountable to you. I take responsibility for everything good and bad in the IFC. If something&#13;
goes wrong, I am totally accountable to you. I cannot say that to you as a Managing Director of&#13;
the World Bank."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And he was very upset, and he said, "What do you mean?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, our role isn't defined. We have responsibilities. I was responsible for private&#13;
sector development. That worked quite well, but my role and, for that matter, I don't think&#13;
Mamphela's role or Jeffs role vis-a-vis the Vice Presidents is exactly defined. Now, in the IFC,&#13;
I have a management team. I am the EVP, and I have Vice Presidents under me. Their role is&#13;
exactly defined, and they are accountable to me. And the distribution of power--that never&#13;
seemed to be quite clear in the Bank."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Bank is more complex than the IFC. But what I always felt was we had very few&#13;
serious discussions at the management level about big things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is sort of a view in the Bank if you ask a question about a certain issue, "Well, why don't&#13;
you read the report first? Oh, there is a report on that? You haven't read this?" At least I think&#13;
Mamphela and I felt very strongly, "Forget about the reports. There are certain decisions which&#13;
have to be made, and before we read the report from some people here, we should discuss where&#13;
do we go and how do we go there."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The management of the Bank was always very process oriented not sort of . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Strategic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE:         .   . strategic, right. So, particularly in the last I would say two or three years, I would&#13;
openly admit I was not a happy camper. I actually said on a number of occasions, "Look, guys,&#13;
I'm wasting my time here. I have so much to do in the IFC, and to sit here for three hours or two&#13;
hours and discuss some processes, I'm not very interested in this."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    think the issue here is that Jim Wolfensohn, who did a spectacular j ob in bringing the role of&#13;
the Bank back to the right platform as the research institute on poverty--you know, when he took&#13;
over, "50 years is enough" --I think the Bank was, again, fully accepted as an institution, so he&#13;
    id a great, absolutely fabulous j ob outside bringing back the reputation. But I think Jim could&#13;
never convince himself to empower the Managing Directors to then implement things and let&#13;
them run internally and let them the manage the Bank. I don't know why. I don't want to&#13;
speculate on that, but I think that was a problem.&#13;
&#13;
I&#13;
BECKER: Was there any interference in what you were trying to do in terms of looking at your&#13;
    rivate sector responsibilities?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No, I think there was some resistance. I mean, when I joined the World Bank&#13;
Group in '99, I was a little bit surprised how unimportant the private sector seemed to be at the&#13;
World Bank or in development per se.I do think that's been changed. I think people like Nick&#13;
[Nicholas] Stem helped tremendously. I think Michael Klein, who worked for me, did an&#13;
absolutely outstanding job bringing investment climate as one of the big pillars for development&#13;
forward. I think the fact we made Michael Klein not only Vice President for Private Sector&#13;
Development but made him head of strategy and the Chief Economist at the IFC was a beautiful&#13;
combination. So I think, in the end, private sector development has become not the most&#13;
important, but one of the more important issues in development overall. So that has worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What I'm referring to is I think the Bank, the IBRD part particularly, some decisions have to be&#13;
taken like, you know, do we continue with the resource allocation--I had mentioned that early&#13;
on--in Eastern Europe, as we have it. Should we shift it somewhat? In that respect, I think the&#13;
MDs were never fully empowered. Or to put it differently, if we made the decisions to do certain&#13;
things, the vice president had access to the president and then things were sort of turned around.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So there was never a resolution of certain kinds of issues?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: There are seldom. Very seldom.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:        Now, how often did the Managing Directors meet?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: We met twice a week. As I said, most of it was very process oriented--a little bit&#13;
show and tell, not a lot of, "Here's a problem. How do we tackle it?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then over the last six to eight months, it sort of petered out. Mamphela was the first&#13;
Managing Director to leave; she took on thisÂ·role of the U.N. Commission for Migration. Then&#13;
Jeff Goldstein left last October, and the whole thing sort of petered out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
\BECKER: So this was obviously very different from the management meetings, the top&#13;
management meetings, at JPMorgan, which were ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. Yeah. And where--and I know, for that matter, what the management&#13;
    eetings of the IFC where the management group said together, "Well, we weren't fighting each&#13;
other. We were sort of expressing our views, but when we left the room decisions were done,&#13;
and we, you know, would stand together."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a tremendous amount of fear to be told by your bosses, "You're wrong. This is not the&#13;
way we do it." And, therefore, one shies away from these discussions and tries to compromise&#13;
and get lots of people involved so that everybody agrees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I was struck when I joined the IFC-- and I said I was overlapping with my predecessor for a&#13;
I   onth, and I was invited to the management meeting, but I didn't participate as an active&#13;
member--but there were never decisions during this month. I mean, people were asked to think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                           31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    about certain things. They made a presentation to the Management Committee, and then if&#13;
    everybody agreed that it was fine, a decision was made. If there was some dissent, the team was&#13;
    told to go back and come with a compromise solution. And that shocked me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I think in the IFC we have had, you know--I said to them, "First of all, if we disagree, we&#13;
    will disagree here in this room, not outside, you know. We'll disagree here." And I think over&#13;
    time--so people weren't--there's nothing wrong when there's disagreement and one or two&#13;
    members were told, "Well, sorry, we don't do it this way. We do it my way, the CEO's way, and&#13;
    then, you know, we can move on from there." There's nothing wrong with that.&#13;
                                                                             .   I mean,&#13;
    everybody is clever and has his own ideas or her own ideas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And we had one decision--I won't go through the details--but where one of the Managing&#13;
    Directors in the Bank and I disagreed a hundred percent on it, and I said to him, "Look, we go to&#13;
    Wolfensohn. He makes the decisions. That's his role, you know."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    "No. No. We can't go. We cannot go to Jim with a disagreement."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I said, "Well, that's total rubbish. I mean, why shouldn't we go with a disagreement? If Jim&#13;
    decides against me, and hopefully he won't take it, you know, he won't take it against me in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I&#13;
    long term. I mean, I have my opinion. You have your opinion. If you're right, then let's move&#13;
    on. But, you know, let's not waste our time."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But no, I mean, there were endless sessions, and experts were asked, et cetera, et cetera. In the&#13;
    end, I--we still disagreed, you know, and Jim had to make this decision. And fine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That's what we did to the IFC. We had in the end healthy, real discussions where, you know, the&#13;
    team members did not disagree, where sometimes I had to make a decision or I was frustrated by&#13;
    some people, that they were right and I gave in. But it worked. And when we left, you know,&#13;
    and it petered down, because people then learned and knew that my vice presidents would&#13;
    disagree or they would disagree with me but there was nothing wrong with it, you know? And&#13;
    this kind of atmosphere I wanted to get down to everybody because there is this fear--we have&#13;
    to--unless we agree, we can't go to the next guy    And I basically think that one of the roles of&#13;
    senior managers is to make decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BECKER: This is interesting. You're not the only person who's talked about this, sort of the&#13;
    inability to make decisions. And aside from the factthat it might have something to do with the&#13;
     ersonality of the person who's in charge of the--it seems to me that it's a larger issue because it's&#13;
    a criticism that ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WOICKE: I saw it in the IFC, that had nothing to do with, you know ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BECKER: Do you think it's the result of the institution being a multi--many different&#13;
     ationalities? Are people more sensitive, or is it just that in the private sector, there's a bottom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
line, and every argument ultimately looks towards this bottom line, and people can make&#13;
judgments about ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: 1 think that it's a little more complex than just the bottom line. One is 1 think&#13;
cultures do play a role. 1 mean, when 1 was running Asia for JPMorgan,1 learned that Asians&#13;
wouldn't disagree with a boss.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No,1 know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And 1 told my Asian colleagues, whether they were Japanese or Chinese or&#13;
whatever,1 said, "I respect your culture "--and as 1 also told my people in the IFC-- "I totally&#13;
respect your culture, but first this is a JPMorgan culture. And the JPMorgan culture is different.&#13;
And if you work with JPMorgan, you have to adapt yourself a little bit. And you have to be&#13;
outspoken. And you have to come up with your ideas."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said the same thing to the IFC. So culture plays a role. There's no doubt about it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then the second point is that I think--and I never completely explained it--is that there is a fear&#13;
of being told, "No, you're wrong. Don't do it your way." And that I never understood because,&#13;
as I said, I personally respect people a lot, and of course 1 can be wrong, you know. Of course&#13;
I'm wrong. And if people persuade me that I'm wrong and we do it his way, why shouldn't we?&#13;
It's a better decision. And then the bottom line is really yes, because too much time is spent to&#13;
come to a consensus and that hurts the bottom line. But I think it's the--you know, that is only&#13;
one of the aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This is your interview, but I have a,theory, which we'll cut it out, but I think it has&#13;
something to do also with the fact that the Bank is made up of people who are sort of almost like&#13;
academics. To an academic to be told that his or her ideas are wrong is a very, very devastating&#13;
kind of thing. 1 see it in the university my whole career. People--you can talk about them&#13;
personally, you can do it, but you attack their work and their ideas and they are deeply, deeply&#13;
hurt by that. 1 just think there may be--not that I would say there's too much of an academic&#13;
atmosphere ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:      . but there's that there, too. People trade on their ideas . ..&#13;
               .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: [Inaudible] to report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: It's probably more in the Bank than the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. No. Definitely. Definitely in the case of ...&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I mean, you probably have that in the IFC as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So, as I said, this is your interview, not my time to--okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Let me tum to another set of questions. You've mentionedNGOs, and obviously it more than-Â­&#13;
you faced some probably more decorousNGOs than you faced in the Bank, but were you&#13;
surprised at the level of opposition to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah. I was surprised at the beginning when I didn't fully understand theNGOs.&#13;
And, you know, 1--1 meanNGOs were something new for me. I found it fascinating and very&#13;
interesting and exciting, so I had meetings with them on a regular basis. Every three or four&#13;
months I would have brown bag lunches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I was--at the beginning, I was shocked, disappointed, frustrated by some of the things that&#13;
the NGOs did to me--or not to me, to the IFC in the World Bank. And it took me a while to&#13;
realize or start differentiating betweenNGOs. And I think there are a number ofNGOs who are&#13;
critical of the IFC, critical of the Bank, critical of MIG A [Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency], but who want to work with us, even if they're critical. And sometimes we simply&#13;
cannot come to an agreement and move--you know, we say, "Okay, on this project, we disagree&#13;
and that's fine as well."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But let me mention a few of theseNGOs. I mean, IFC has worked very closely with Amnesty&#13;
International because I'm a great believer that eventually human rights will have to be included&#13;
into the safeguards. We knew very little about human rights, and interestingly enough Amnesty&#13;
International was very keen to work with IFC because they had approached human rights very&#13;
much from a governmental point of view and never worked with the private sector until just&#13;
three or four years ago. So that was a very good cooperation. I think Oxfam we can work with&#13;
very well or WWF [World Wildlife Fund forNature] or Conservation International. And clearly,&#13;
you know, we had some big problems with WWF on certain projects, but in others we worked&#13;
with them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But I think then I also learned--I personally learned--that there are advocates. Right? And I'm&#13;
not against advocacy, and I think they're good as well, but, you know, then I said to myself, "For&#13;
the advocates we never can do it right." Right? And then there comes point where I say, "Okay,&#13;
let's disagree, and you judge us on our project or the program which we do or they go on. I have&#13;
to run the risk that is you're going to be right. I think I'm going to be right, but let's stop the&#13;
discussion here."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And that sort of, you know, it dawned on me in the last two three years, and I have become-Â­&#13;
some people tell me that I have become sort of less friendly to some of these. It has nothing to&#13;
do with friendliness. I think it's just recognition that with the advocates, I cannot argue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   RESTRICTED&#13;

BECKER: Okay. Would you say that--well, you talked about human rights as being&#13;
          .&#13;
ultimately...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: ..one of the considerations. I'm not saying you learned that from the NGOs, but I&#13;
mean were there things that where the NGOs changed your mind or ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No. No. I think--Iook. I have to make it very clear that the safeguards which the&#13;
IFC had would never have happened without the NGOs. I think the human being is against, you&#13;
know, more complexity, et cetera, et cetera, and the safeguards added to the complexity. The&#13;
investment office in the IFC, the IFC didn't like it. And I think, thanks to the NGOs, we have&#13;
safeguards, and in the end I think they've proved good for sustainability, competitiveness, et&#13;
cetera, et cetera. So I think the NGOs and the stakeholders have done fantastic work in making&#13;
the environment better. I mean, human rights, the issue, in the private sector companies actually&#13;
embrace now--some of them--human rights, because again it enhances long-term profitability if&#13;
they treat people decently well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So the problem which we had--I don't want to bore you with it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No. No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I mean, the problem we had with human rights was that--and you know we started&#13;
talking to experts on human rights. Amnesty International came a little bit later. And the experts&#13;
had told me on the private sector, you basically can isolate a project, a private sector project in a&#13;
country, because my question to them was, "Wouldn't we have to stop working in 50 percent of&#13;
the countries where governments don't respect human rights?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                        35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WOICKE: And the experts said, "No, no, no. You can isolate private sector projects if your&#13;
    companies treat the social environment well, if they treat their employees well, and respect&#13;
    human rights--that project they can do."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    My question was always, "What is the issue of complicity?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    "Well, you're not supporting a government if you do a project in this area of work that these local&#13;
    people benefit from it." But, you know, you take it to extremes. We have, of course, financed&#13;
    pipelines. If you look at the--my example is also if you look at the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkish&#13;
    pipeline [Caspian Sea Early Oil Development Project]. .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I   WOICKE: .if the pipeline was going up in Turkey, they have security around the pipeline.&#13;
                  .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    They follow the so-called terrorists who blew up the pipeline, following them to a village, catch&#13;
    them, start torturing, isn't that complicity then? And that's one of the issues that we have been&#13;
    struggling with, why I have been--you know, I think I was the first one to push human rights into&#13;
    the safeguards of the World Bank Group, and everybody was saying, "Well, we have to go slow&#13;
    because we haven't really grappled with this." And, of course, we have shareholders who are&#13;
    extremely upset with me that human rights came on the agenda, because they always refer back&#13;
    to the Articles [of Agreement]--the Articles are non-political; and, therefore, you shouldn't be&#13;
    involved. And one of the shareholders was bitterly complaining that my wife basically invited&#13;
    Shirin Ebadi from Iran to come here. Right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I think the only way to do it is that it makes economic sense, you know. Forget about the&#13;
    politics, the audience of the Bank or the IFC. As long as it makes economic sense to respect&#13;
    human rights, I think that's why we should do it. But the complicity issue is what I would say&#13;
    matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BECKER: What about the--not only with IFC, but also with the Bank more generally--the&#13;
    pressure or the presence, I should say, of the U.S.government. I'm thinking in the terms of you&#13;
    were at IFC, the Meltzer Commission [International Financial Institutions Advisory&#13;
    Commission], for instance, that kind of thing. First of all, what did you make of the kinds of&#13;
    proposals that [Dr.Allan H.] Meltzer and his colleagues were ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ""OICKE: Well, I actually had gone to the--I thought that--the Meltzer Commission helped me&#13;
    r   lot to understand the whole issue of development of IFC and the World Bank a little bit better.&#13;
              .&#13;
    I&#13;
    BECKER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    M'OICKE: And I thought this as actually quite a bit of fun. Professor Meltzer, as you&#13;
    remember, suggested that the IFC should be abolished. It wasn't necessary anymore. And so I&#13;
    had invited him to the IFC. He came over three or four times, and I think he changed his mind,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and he hadn't fully appreciated the IFC. He had focused on the World Bank,and here's the IFC&#13;
focusing on the private sector, and the private sector can do it alone. The IFC is not needed.&#13;
They should take back the money. And after Allan was in the IFC for three or four lunches,he&#13;
actually said, "No,no,no. You have an important role. You actually should take over what the&#13;
World Bank does." Well,so I think we had some good discussions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It came up again. Recently, Ken [Kenneth] Rogoff, the former economist of the Fund,now at&#13;
Harvard,published a paper the other day where he said,again,you know,"The IFC should be&#13;
abolished. It's useless," that we didn't need it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I didn't see that here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And we had invited him to our retreat of the management, you know,and we gave&#13;
him the opportunity to expose his theory why the IFC should be abolished. And then we had a&#13;
big debate,and basically I think he came again from the old view that the IFC was doing project&#13;
finance for companies from the North in emerging markets and the stuff that we needed for that,&#13;
and we said, "Yeah,but we're hardly doing this anymore. And we're supporting the companies&#13;
in the emerging markets,who don't have access to the money." He thought it was very&#13;
interesting, fascinating. He didn't know, but he didn't change his mind. This is perhaps a little&#13;
bit what you said.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah,but I think every ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: He didn't change his mind. But, you know, it shows one of these, which I always&#13;
[inaudible] big sort of difficulties for conflicts in the IFC. On the one hand, I mean if you&#13;
compare the IFC with a private sector company, if you're a private company you want to increase&#13;
profits. You want to grow,et cetera, et cetera. That is the ultimate purpose of a private sector&#13;
company. The IFC's ultimate purpose is to liquidate it. Right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And,you know, I've always said to my colleagues, "The biggest success of the IFC&#13;
would be if in 15 or 20 or 25 years the last guy would turn off the lights,and we would be all&#13;
 orking with the private sector." That's probably too optimistic. But how do you motivate&#13;
people to basically work for something which eventually abolishes them? I think [it's] one of the&#13;
'&#13;
real challenges, management challenges of the organization, you know. And that's a little bit&#13;
what I think the IBRD is facing today where the mid-income countries--the Russias,the Chinas,&#13;
the Indias-basically have access to the market. The sovereign governments, they don't want to&#13;
borrow necessarily anymore from the Bank, and rather than saying, "Let's declare victory," the&#13;
Bank is now, "Oh,we can lend cheap money to you, and let's reduce the conditionalities." It's&#13;
this phenomenon,you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well,business is one of staying in business because they want to make money ..&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: ..but organizations want to stay in business because they want to remain&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Absolutely. Absolutely. That's the real challenge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Yeah. It occurs to me that I had a question about--there was at one point in&#13;
your tenure that there was a great deal of discussion about additionality. Did that come in&#13;
connection with the Meltzer Report, or was that prompted by something ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I mean, additionality is always around because the IFC cannot be just a normal&#13;
investment bank financing just the private sector in emerging markets. It--some additionality&#13;
other than the finance has to be there, because if it's just financing, then, you know, the private&#13;
sector could be doing it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: So additionality is always an issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Although I was surprised that the debate occurred at a time when, in fact, the private&#13;
sector had fled from, you know, Asia ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No. This absolutely surprised me as well, because--and it has become rather quiet&#13;
now around this whole thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: It's a fascinating development. When I joined the IFC at the end of '98, the Asian&#13;
crisis was there, yes. But there was still--I remember I was at a meeting with the IIF [Institute of&#13;
International Finance], and Citibank and HSBC were there, et cetera, et cetera, and then violently&#13;
criticized the IFC for, you know, with its tax advantages, et cetera, et cetera, competing against&#13;
them. That has totally gone away. And the commercial bank, international commercial banks,&#13;
have slowly but surely moved out of what I call long term cross border lending. They are not&#13;
there anymore. I just talked to a big international bank the other day, and I was surprised that as&#13;
international as they are, they are not--they're still serving the multinationals and the consumers,&#13;
small consumers. But the middle market, the medium-sized larger companies in Brazil or India&#13;
or Russia, are not being served by this international bank. So that is a big market segment for the&#13;
{FC, a big opportunity for the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think this whole issue of the IFC's competing unfairly, this is a dead issue. It will come up&#13;
again as soon as the big local banks--the Citibanks, the HSBCs, et cetera, et cetera--discover this&#13;
middle market, you know, which we're focusing--the IFC is now focusing on it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then, you know, it might be that the IFC has to withdraw increasing the capacity, because I&#13;
think with--the IFC has actually has been quite good with this. I mean, the IFC was very active&#13;
in places like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, all these countries too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Also I was going to say it seemed to me in the middle market that if the&#13;
capital markets develop sufficiently in these countries, they are going to take it up, and the big&#13;
banks are not going be in there, either.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Exactly. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You've touched on some of these issues in things that you've already said, but I&#13;
wanted to ask you a little bit about some thoughts about the future. And at the risk of asking you&#13;
to be redundant after having talked for over two hours here now, what are the most pressing&#13;
issues for the IFC and Bank in the next 10 or 20 years, in your opinion?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, let me mention one aspect which we haven't covered which I think was of all&#13;
the issues--I mean we talked about sustainability. We're talking about SMEs, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
But the one issue which, you know, if you would ask me today what are you proudest about, I&#13;
would say it's the increase in the involvement of the IFC in what I call technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, you know, the IFC had done some technical assistance with young people on&#13;
the ground. One of the most prominent things which the IFC had done with donor money-Â­&#13;
basically it was the technical assistance in Russia. The U.K. and some other governments had in&#13;
the early '90s financed a program of the IFC where the IFC had hired some young Russians who&#13;
were basically involved in the first privatization in Russia, and not privatization of the Yukos but&#13;
tiny little companies. I was told if you walked around in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the bakers,&#13;
the restaurants, et cetera, et cetera, which you see today were to a large extent privatized by the&#13;
IFC. IFC has privatized in Russia I think 140,000 small companies through an auction process.&#13;
I mean, the IFC brought the auction process to Russia and said, "Look, all these restaurants and&#13;
the barber shops, the butchers. How do you privatize them? Through an auction process.&#13;
Right?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then they did a great job in the Ukraine where these young people discovered--we had 300&#13;
young Russians working for us, you know--where they discovered that a lot of uncompleted&#13;
buildings were there in the hands of the government. And these guys went to the Ukrainian&#13;
government and said, "What are you doing?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Well, there are not many sources of money from the World Bank."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Well, then, you auction them off to private sector companies."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hugely successful. That was one area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then they got involved in corporate governance. You had a lot of mid-sized private companies&#13;
in Russia, who didn't know how to run shareholders meetings, didn't know what the minority&#13;
shareholder was, et cetera, et cetera, and these young people went specifically to companies and&#13;
said, "We want to give you advice on corporate governance."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We had the same in Africa--APDF [Africa Project Development Facility]--where they were&#13;
advising smaller companies on modern marketing, et cetera, et cetera. We had a facility in&#13;
Vietnam which was advising or helping to design SME legislation in Vietnam, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera. There were sort of quite a few things. And I have to say I got totally fascinated by this.&#13;
Number one, I thought there was managerial challenge because these projects--they were called&#13;
project facilities--were sort of in isolation from the IFC. Some of these guys were, although they&#13;
were donor funded, they're also IFC funded from some of our administrative budget. They&#13;
weren't even carrying IFC visitors' cards. They were carrying APDF cards, and they call them&#13;
facility cards, but the IFC wasn't mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the regional directors who were from these countries didn't care. I mean, we were sort of&#13;
the big investment guys, you know, whether these guys were doing technical assistance. And&#13;
one thing I felt and I've talked about this a long--I certainly have not become a development&#13;
specialist in six years--but one thing I think the donors are doing too little of--World Bank,&#13;
everybody is doing too little--is this on the ground technical assistance. The Bank might call it&#13;
capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: The Bank would argue we have done capacity building for years and years and&#13;
years. But I've always demonstrated with one example which for me was sort of determining,&#13;
really. I was in Ghana. We had talked to the Ghanaian government for three or four years about&#13;
getting their electricity production off the ground because they desperately need more electricity.&#13;
And I had a meeting where the senior minister and four or five of this minister's cabinet&#13;
colleagues for three or four hours talking about the electricity. So this was about two and half,&#13;
two years ago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the senior minister took me aside and said, "Peter, it doesn't work this way."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What do you mean doesn't work?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Let me tell you what's happening here. The World Bank is coming on a mission for&#13;
ten days or two weeks--experts on electricity reform--and they tell us in ten days what kind of&#13;
reforms we have to do in Ghana. And then they leave, and then comes the IFC on a mission&#13;
three or four months later, and they say, 'Well, you have done only five percent of the reforms&#13;
the World Bank told you; therefore, this is not really private. We cannot finance you.' And then&#13;
the World Bank and others six months later come in and proclaim that we have funded five&#13;
percent. Right?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                  March 7, 2005   -   Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "So what are you telling me?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Peter, we respect the advice which we get from the World Bank on the reforms in&#13;
the electricity sector, but we need people on the ground to take, put their arms around us, and&#13;
help us implement this stuff. We can't do it ourselves. It's too high level. We can't do it&#13;
ourselves. "&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think that sort of exemplifies what is missing in development today. Too little is done, and&#13;
when we raise funds from donors for this technical assistance, it's very difficult to raise the&#13;
funds. We usually get them from Switzerland. We get them from Holland. We get them from&#13;
the other countries. The big rich countries all want to have their flag in the ground on a project.&#13;
This is a German project. This is a U.K. project. This is an American project. But to give&#13;
money for technical assistance for training there are different ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who were the 300 Russians that you had on the ground and where did you get them&#13;
and how did you train them?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Universities. We trained them. Very simple. And what we did over time, we had&#13;
to integrate them into our work, and we changed the reporting of these facilities directly to the&#13;
regional directors. And I said to the regional directors, "If you are in Asia or you're in Russia as&#13;
the IFC regional directors, you are responsible for this technical assistance in the future." And&#13;
all of a sudden this thing has taken off. We have now, I think, 700, 800 people. Russia has&#13;
scaled back because it's not needed that much; part of these people have been sent to Central&#13;
Asia, Tajikistan, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I mean--to give you a few examples. We have an Australian farm expert who has created singleÂ­&#13;
handedly, through technical assistance, the first farm cooperative in Tajikistan. And subsistence&#13;
farmers for the first time have cash crops, et cetera, et cetera. Six private farms put together in a&#13;
cooperative. He's doing this in another area now. That's the kind of technical assistance which is&#13;
needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And we have now also said we have to integrate this technical assistance into the bigger projects.&#13;
What do I mean by this? If you have a big project somewhere in Africa, make sure that more&#13;
supplies are coming from the local level. The technical expertise of the farmers is not there. We&#13;
have a project with one of the Dutch retailers who worked with us and said, "How can we bring&#13;
African produce onto our shelves in Europe?" And they looked at the fruit and the vegetables&#13;
which we produced in Ghana that was not good enough, you know. So we banded together with&#13;
this company, and we have now a program which teaches the farmers how to produce vegetables&#13;
and fruit in a way that it can be shipped in the next day onto the shelves. I mean this is just one&#13;
example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we have today about 700, 800 people who do exclusively this, even in Latin America and the&#13;
Andean countries. We have this fascinating--I don't know whether you've heard about the Doing&#13;
Business Report which the Bank has published, which basically ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I've heard of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: ..it's a joint effort between IFC and Bank, and it looks through the eyes of the small&#13;
entrepreneur at the difficulties he or she has in the countries. And it looks at very simple things&#13;
like how many permits do you need to open a restaurant, a very small business; how enforceable&#13;
are the contracts, et cetera, et cetera. And when the first report came out a few years ago it was&#13;
devastating, because in New Zealand you need one permit and you get it the same day, and in&#13;
Brazil you need 150 permits and it takes two and half years which means nobody wants to work&#13;
in the official economy. Everybody works in the underground economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Now, the report has been, to a large extent, well received, very well received; the&#13;
mayor of Lima (as an example) approached the IFC and said, "Look this report is very good.&#13;
Lima is very bad or the bureaucracy. I don't know how to do it. Can we have a team of&#13;
technical experts to help us to reduce the bureaucracy in Lima?" So we have right now three&#13;
people working technical assistance with the Lima government on how to simplify rules and&#13;
regulations. That's the kind of technical assistance which is needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The Bank itself isn't doing this or ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Not on the ground. I mean, they give the advice, but there's too little really practical&#13;
work on the ground. That's what I mean. It's the practical, you know, partnership for this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And, as I said, we funded this in the past always in--it's a little bit out of our administrative&#13;
budget, and then we went to the donors. And since we have had two very good years in terms of&#13;
profits, we went to the Board and we suggested to the Board that we take a percentage out of our&#13;
net income now to build this. Right? And we--I checked first with the rating agencies so that&#13;
they won't feel that we are giving too much of our capital away--and we worked out a formula.&#13;
But, you know, last year the formula allowed us to set aside $225 million to deal with technical&#13;
assistance, which is great. And this year I think the IFC is having another good year. It's&#13;
probably another $200 million. So you have quite a bit of money which is now being spent on&#13;
technical assistance, which makes the projects of IFC better and does really something for local&#13;
community development, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, also, you wonder what will happen to the people who do this in the future. I&#13;
mean, they might, in fact, become entrepreneurs or ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: ..you know,that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I mean,we have a--it's fascinating. We have one of these technical assistance&#13;
groups in the interior of China,et cetera,you know,where they focus on the development of&#13;
smaller companies. And we had--I was sitting with clients who they were dealing with,no more&#13;
than about 30 clients. And two of the clients basically said--they introduced themselves as future&#13;
consulting companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said,"Well,that's very interesting."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They said, "We want to do what you're doing here in two years from now. You should be&#13;
redundant. We want to do this for profit."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think that is building for the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Just one other thing. Africa--we had one of the big venture capitalists from the New York who&#13;
was very successful and retired came to the IFC and said, "Look,I want to work pro bono for&#13;
you guys and, you know, how can I help?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said to him, "Why don't you go to Africa,because we want to do more SME financing.&#13;
We need venture capital,et cetera,et cetera,you know."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the guy spent four weeks in Africa talking to governments,talking to SMEs,talking to&#13;
everybody. And he came back with a report which was very interesting. But it struck me the&#13;
main theme was if you invest in Africa or if you lend long term in Africa,every dollar has to be&#13;
accompanied by one dollar of technical assistance. He said,"They are good entrepreneurs,but&#13;
they don't have financial expertise,et cetera,et cetera,and let it be accompanied by technical&#13;
assistance."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Africa,private education is becoming very,very important. The public education is a disaster&#13;
in Africa. I mean,I wish the donors would finally recognize it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: They've put a lot of money into it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: A huge amount of money. We have financed a number ofK to 12 schools in Africa&#13;
who were classically established by disgruntled public teachers who saw the misery and said,"I&#13;
can do it better."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And the schools are very good,but I was told their loan paybacks are not good. I said, "Why&#13;
can't they pay it back? They're making money, et cetera, et cetera."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Yeah,but they don't know how to manage their finances," they said. "This rural teacher,of&#13;
course,doesn't know how to manage financially a thing. Why don't you give them the&#13;
technical .."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: .."assistance on the finance." And guess what? It's working in Africa, so I think&#13;
this has really taken hold in the IFe, and this is one of the things I wanted to do to the end. And&#13;
I think it's a huge success, and I think we're very, very proud and very happy about this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I might say, as someone who's read all of your annual reports lately, it's not&#13;
emphasized enough in your reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: It's getting there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It's in the 2004, I know, but that needs to be emphasized more. Is there something&#13;
else about ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yes. Even, you know, we had even the battle, interestingly enough, with Board on&#13;
that, because the attitude of our Board members from Africa, for instance, was for quite a while,&#13;
"You want to replace technical assistance with real investments. You are worried about the&#13;
riskiness of the investments, so you don't want to make the investments. You want to basically,&#13;
you know, do technical assistance." And it took them quite a while to--there was a lot of&#13;
resistance in the Board against this technical assistance. This is not part of the IFe, and we just&#13;
want to shy away from risk, et cetera, et cetera. It took us two or three years really to convince&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Is there something else that I should have asked?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'm sorry I missed that. But to go back, then, to some of these thoughts about the&#13;
future, the question, I would say, now what are the most pressing issues for IFe and the Bank in&#13;
the next 10 to 20 years?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think 10 to 20 years is perhaps a little bit long. What I think is one of the&#13;
most pressing issues for IFe and the World Bank--and I think it will come to heads very quicklyÂ­&#13;
-it is related to this issue which I have mentioned a few times that the actual demand from the&#13;
sovereigns to borrow is decreasing for the countries who have access to the markets. And this&#13;
debate in the Bank, you know: We have cheap money of 18 years. Why are you choosing the&#13;
markets where you borrow? It's more expensive. I think every finance minister who has the&#13;
chance to borrow on the markets will do it and even if it's a little bit more expense, because they&#13;
think it increases the rating of the country, understanding of the country, they're getting off&#13;
dependence from the development institutions, which I think that's natural.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The big challenge, the big demand, is now coming from what I call the sub-sovereigns. There is&#13;
a trend in the developing countries--you see it in Mexico; you see it in India; you see it South&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Africa--to push responsibility for infrastructure more and more into the municipalities. I was for&#13;
one year part of the [Michel] Camdessus Water Panel [World Panel on Financing Water&#13;
Infrastructure], which was looking at financing the big water investments in the world, how to&#13;
meet the millennium development goals. An additional $100 billion was needed for water in the&#13;
poor countries, and what we learned over time was that 90 percent of water today is handled by&#13;
municipalities. But it's not only water; it's, you know, electricity. Your responsibility is being&#13;
pushed down. Transportation--roads are more and more pushed into the municipalities. And&#13;
here the issue is the Bank, the IBRD, cannot lend to municipalities because the Bank needs the&#13;
guarantee from the sovereign. Right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If you look at how the multilaterals, the EBRD can lend to sub-sovereigns, and they have started&#13;
this. The Asian Development Bank, I think, can lend to sub-sovereigns. So you have a&#13;
decreased demand from sovereigns but at the same time a heavily increased demand from subÂ­&#13;
sovereIgns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, about a year ago, we--this was one of the more serious discussions which we had at the,&#13;
actually the MD level, and we debated, you know, what is the solution. And we said, "Well, one&#13;
of the solutions would be to change the Articles of the World Bank so that the World Bank can&#13;
also lend to sub-sovereigns." And then one of my colleagues--I think it was Jeff Goldstein--he&#13;
said, "Well, it is probably easier to change the Articles of the World Bank than to create a credit&#13;
culture in the World Bank because the credit culture isn't there. I mean, you lend to sovereigns&#13;
and the loans are also repaid."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Paid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And if they can't repay you, you lend them a little bit more. Well, municipal&#13;
financing, sub-sovereign financing, is all about credit. You know, you cannot really rely--if you&#13;
were to rely on the sovereign, it wouldn't be sub-sovereign lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: And so we decided that the IFC wouldn't have a problem in providing money to&#13;
sub-sovereigns. Right? You could construct it, and we went on the pilot project. We had done&#13;
at the IFC two or three sub-sovereign financings. Now, one thing which we learned very&#13;
quickly--and this goes back to technical assistance--the technical knowhow in these&#13;
municipalities certainly isn't there. We did a small financing for water works in a municipality in&#13;
Mexico, and discovered it didn't even have an engineer, water engineer. Right? So if we want to&#13;
be successful, we have to combine this with technical assistance, financial assistance, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera. We have to build it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But coming to the problem, the challenge over the next few years is going to be how does the&#13;
World Bank Group tackle sub-sovereign financing. Now, I have suggested to the Board in my&#13;
last official speech that the credit culture in the IFC is simply there. Push the IFC perhaps from a&#13;
strictly private sector financing vehicle to a credit financing vehicle through a sub-sovereign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 finance, and see--increase the resources, and if you eventually need a capital reallocation from&#13;
 the IBRD, which doesn't need the capital anymore, you put it into the IFC, and make the IFC sort&#13;
 of a sub-sovereign financer, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 That is, in my opinion, sort of--not the next 10 or 20 years; that is the big issue over the next five&#13;
 years. How do you handle the sub-sovereign financing? More longer term for the Bank, the&#13;
 question is: how do you transfer the Bank--and we have talked a lot about this--from a provider&#13;
 of massive loans into a knowledge bank? I call it more advisory services bank. Some of the&#13;
 mid-income countries will not borrow, but they might, you know, want to have the expertise of&#13;
 the Bank in certain regions on poverty reduction, which is still a big topic even in China despite&#13;
 the fact that they have a space program now. How does the Bank--and I think the Bank needs to&#13;
 focus on how to provide these knowledge services to these countries. They have to come up.&#13;
 The only country where they do it very successfully for money is in Saudi Arabia. The Bank has&#13;
 been active in Saudi Arabia, providing knowledge services and giving advice. And it's been paid&#13;
 for. And I think that is one of the things which need to be addressed in the future. I think there's&#13;
 still--there is a tremendous--I mean the research of the Bank is amazing on poverty reduction.&#13;
 How do you translate this into an advisory service for these countries without necessarily lending&#13;
 them money?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 You know, I think there is--still a lot of the attitude is: unless we're lending we don't have&#13;
 enough say and we cannot really provide these services in an efficient way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 BECKER:      You've mentioned sub-Saharan Africa as the real challenge. What's the challenge&#13;
 within the Bank to change its focus to sub-Saharan Africa?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 WOICKE: Well, I think the Bank again already has a big focus on Africa. But I would, I think,&#13;
 argue that they need even more resources. I think they need more people on the ground in&#13;
 Africa. This goes back to this, you know, on the ground technical assistance. The Bank has,&#13;
 under Jim Wolfensohn, decentralized a lot so that two-thirds of the country directors are now on&#13;
 location. To be honest with you, I'm not impressed by this number anymore. I don't think any&#13;
country director should sit in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
. And, you know, it's easier said than done, because how you move the people out there, et cetera,&#13;
et cetera. But I think the Bank has to come up with a model that every country director sits in the&#13;
country where he works. I mean, I simply cannot believe that the country director who is&#13;
responsible for Chad and some of these countries can do this out of Washington. He has to have&#13;
daily contact with the government. He has to figure out, you know: how can we help these&#13;
governments on location or out of Washington? You know, I also think that when you talk about&#13;
 decentralization that eventually even the vice presidents should be sitting in the regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You know, every sub-Saharan country today has a big Bank office, but a lot of the people, when&#13;
I visit these offices, I would say 95 percent are locals. Now, there are two problems with that.&#13;
Number one, because the Bank is one of the few institutions--this goes back to, you know,&#13;
salaries and payment-- which pays a decent salary, so it's attractive for the locals to join the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Bank, and I think the Bank absorbs a good part of the creme de la creme in these&#13;
countries, which is a problem in itself. That's one of the issues. The other issue is that these&#13;
locals might be well educated, and the best educated, but can they really bring the kind of service&#13;
these countries need, which is more global? So I think we need to have a better balance between&#13;
international experts who sit on the ground and help these people and for the locals whiCh we&#13;
have there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
First, you know, it's a big budgetary challenge because some of the Bank has been for years now&#13;
in a battle over budgets, et cetera, et cetera. I have always said to the Board, "Before we&#13;
decentralize the IFC, I'm not here to tell you this is going to be cheap. Decentralization is more&#13;
expensive than having people sit in Washington and just travel out there. But I think in the long&#13;
run the effectiveness, the efficiency of development work will be improved and that's what&#13;
where the catch will be. But when you talk about decentralization, particularly in Africa, I think&#13;
you need perhaps not necessarily many more resources, but different resources in these&#13;
countries, and they will be more expensive."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about people. You've obviously mentioned a&#13;
number of people. But in working at the Bank, who was most important to you?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: What do you mean? Just ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, important in terms of helping you with, first of all, getting a grasp of the IFC&#13;
and dealing with the IFC. Who was most helpful in getting you to be able to negotiate the&#13;
managing director position or the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I think that's a very difficult question to answer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: I think it depends, you know. I found my boss, Mr. Wolfensohn, always extremely&#13;
receptive to ideas which I had--very helpful in providing his own advice. I think if I had a good&#13;
suggestion he never turned me down on something and was very quickly very supportive. So I&#13;
think that is important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I mean, I was very lucky in a way that, you know, he left me completely alone in the IFC. I&#13;
mean the goal, if you look at the--again, the Articles, the role of the VP is to run the IFC day to&#13;
day, and the President is responsible. I think I was lucky. I had a real CEO job. I mean, I really&#13;
felt responsible for strategy, for everything, and Jim basically said, "Fine. He's doing a fine job,&#13;
so that's fine." So I think that was helpful. My only complaint here was I think he should have&#13;
empowered us in the Bank, as he empowered me in the IFC. If he had empowered the Managing&#13;
Directors in the Bank, I think he would have been seen in the medium term as having an even&#13;
better job than he did, if I can put it very diplomatically. Right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then I think in my work with the IFC--Iet me put it this way: what I discovered was--what I&#13;
struggled with is that the IFC was able to attract the best young people you can imagine. I mean,&#13;
even if the investment banks would be willing to pay much more than what we paid,but young&#13;
people came to the IFC. We had big turnover in the first four years, so there was this interesting&#13;
thing. We got the best people. The turnover in the four years was heavy. Then it petered out,&#13;
and then I always said,sort of a little bit cynically,that, "Everybody who stayed for 10 years or&#13;
longer never left the IFC," which in itself poses a little bit of a problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So who was helpful? I think it was--at the beginning I tried to listen to the young people. I tried&#13;
to empower them. I think the first year some people were very upset with me and that,you&#13;
know,they said, "You will empower them too much and they lose their respect for their seniors&#13;
and that's it. That's how." I had a different concept of management. I felt from where I came&#13;
that the role of senior managers was basically to facilitate the work of the worker bees. I didn't&#13;
do projects myself,you know. But my role was to facilitate the investment officers in their&#13;
work,while the seniors acted bureaucratically. You know,you order these guys what to do and&#13;
how to do it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And it came out in the beginning very often when I met with departments that the people told&#13;
me,whether it was health and education or gas whatever,you know, financial markets, "Well,&#13;
you need to give us the directions where you want us to go."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "That's rubbish. I mean,you are the experts. You tell me where you want to go,and&#13;
then it's my role to say yes or no. And if I say yes, then it's my role to enforce it. But," I said,&#13;
"you guys are the experts. I can give you sort of the long-term goals,yes,but I can't give you&#13;
directions what you should be doing." And I think in that respect it helped a lot,and the&#13;
atmosphere changed in the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I don't know whether I answered your question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I think you did. I always ask because when one tries to look at an institution,there's&#13;
official reports and there are the organizational charts and all,but as anyone who's worked in an&#13;
institution knows, that quite often what's really important are the interpersonal relationships that&#13;
are beyond the organizational chart ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: ..to see how something really works. That's why I always ask about it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think the other thing, then, which really I think worked well is we had a&#13;
Management Committee in the IFC. They came clearly from this old established notion: one&#13;
doesn't disagree, et cetera,et cetera. And I think after a while they trusted me enough that they&#13;
disagreed,you know. And I'm sometimes pretty passionate. I can--you know, I can explode and&#13;
et cetera,et cetera,and they realized that I forget about things. On the spur of the moment, I .&#13;
said, "This is the biggest bullshit I've ever heard in my life," you know. But that's okay. And&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they could say this to me as well. And I think after sort of two years we had an atmosphere in&#13;
our group, among the vice presidents and myself, of total trust in each other, where, you know,&#13;
we could have really--I wouldn't call it violent, but kind of violent disagreements in our&#13;
management meetings, which were loud and noisy. I remember at some point, you know, my&#13;
assistant came and said, "What's going on?" because we were--it was very noisy. And, as I said,&#13;
when we left the room, we spoke with one voice. And I think the vice presidents, the&#13;
management team, became extremely sort of-empowered isn't the right word--but sort of very,&#13;
very important in the change of the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think, then, sort of the next thing which we tackled were the directors. I mean, after three&#13;
months in the IFC, I said, "When you start with the IFC, you want to become the baron director.&#13;
You don't want to become a vice president. You certainly don't want to become an EVP ,"&#13;
because everything stopped at the baron level. I mean, they weren't talking to each other. It was&#13;
sort of the most desired job because you had made it. You were totally independent. You were&#13;
directing a department. It was hierarchical. You were giving orders, and that was the most&#13;
desirable job in the IFC, you know. And I think I convinced the Management Committee first&#13;
that had to change, you know, and over time we changed most of the directors. They are now&#13;
pretty young. The organization also made sure that on projects, we had to have two directors to&#13;
be on a project. The regional director and the industry director had to work together, who&#13;
competed with each other, you know. While before we had this reorganization, every director&#13;
made his own decisions on projects, which meant if you didn't like the project, it was delayed for&#13;
a year, and if you liked it, it was done fast. Now, with the competition from the industry&#13;
directors, the regional directors, who were pushing, arguing, "My client is sitting here and he&#13;
wants to see the money. He wants to see the help of the IFC," this became a little more&#13;
competitive. And the fact that we had the younger directors who liked this kind of work--I think&#13;
the atmosphere changed. I guess nobody talks about balance anymore.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Okay. I don't know if you want to get into this. Well, let me ask you why&#13;
did you decide to leave?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Because I was 62, and I had to leave.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh. You had to leave at 62? I thought it was 65?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No. No. No. It was 62.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh. Well, that's an easy answer then to the question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Do you have any thoughts about who should succeed Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: Well, I think I sort of said in all the discussions which we have had this morning&#13;
here that some of the issues which need to be tackled--this sub-sovereign side, et cetera, et&#13;
cetera, the reallocation of resources. I think the successor to Wolfensohn needs to be a person&#13;
who is focused a bit more on the managerial side. I think Jim was absolutely the right person at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the right time. The leadership to the outside. Reestablishing the Bank--the Bank's reputation. I&#13;
think he was there at the right time, but I think there's a time for everybody, and I think now as&#13;
the reputation of the Bank is reestablished and in order not to lose it quickly, I think you need a&#13;
person who is focusing on the management of the Bank because, as you said, I never understood,&#13;
for instance, the endless discussions to date in the World Bank with the shareholders on budget.&#13;
I mean, how ridiculous can it be when the administrative budget of the institution is $1.6 billion,&#13;
and they are locked into battles over $50 million increase or not? I mean, who cares about $50&#13;
million? But 1 think it exemplifies a little bit where, you know, the management has to be heavy&#13;
enough. I mean, Jim always sort of laughingly, cynically said to me, "1 don't know how you do&#13;
it with the Board; why you have such a great relationship with the Board, and we don't in the&#13;
Bank." You know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the things which I did--and I never got involved in endless debates about the sitting&#13;
Board and how bad the Board was, et cetera, et cetera; I mean they're good people on the Board,&#13;
as well as less good people--but one thing which 1 found at the beginning was the transparency&#13;
issue. On my first budget in the IFC, 1 said, "This is what we're going to present to the Board.&#13;
This is what we're going to ask from the Board."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And my colleagues said, "You can't."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1 said, "What do you mean I can't."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Well, these numbers which you want to reveal to the Board you shouldn't because the Board&#13;
will never give you anything back, et cetera, et cetera."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You guys are out of your mind. The Board--1 mean, they're shareholders. 1 have to be&#13;
totally honest with them."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think it was difficult manifestly because of the issue where, you know, we would be under&#13;
budget in a certain year. Right? I would go to the Board and say, "We're under budget by 10 or&#13;
15 or 50 million bucks, but I don't want you to take this money back. Here's the reason why we&#13;
are under budget. But 1 may need it next year."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The first year this was very difficult, you know. And I said to the Board, "Look guys, 1 mean, if&#13;
you don't understand that, you'll force me next time to be untransparent because I won't reveal a&#13;
number to you. Right?" And we had this dialogue, and over the years I think the Board was&#13;
now trusting the IFC totally in terms of budget numbers and transparency. And we have had&#13;
situations, you know, where we're under budget, and we kept the--whatever it was; 30, 40, 50&#13;
million dollars--and we were hoping to, how we use it next years, and we got it next year again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I think this is a time now--last year we got, you know, for two or three years we were at&#13;
zero budget at the IFC. And I said, "You know, we have problem. Our revenues are not&#13;
growing"--and this was in 2001-"and I'm not going to ask you for a budget increase because if&#13;
the revenues don't grow, we shouldn't have a budget increase. But if revenues will go up, I ask&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
for a big budget increase." And we did last year, and we got a 10 percent. And I think this year&#13;
they're going to ask for more, and rightly so. Right? If you can demonstrate that your&#13;
development, in fact, is there, that the profit rate is there, you should get more budget. And I&#13;
think this is what is needed in the Bank, more focused on the management, resource allocation,&#13;
et cetera, et cetera. That's why I think the next guy has to be sort of a little bit more focused on&#13;
management, or if he doesn't want to, then he should be willing to empower the Managing&#13;
Director to do these things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:      Is there anything that you want to add that I haven't asked you about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WOICKE: No. I think we covered most of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:      Okay. Well, thank you very much.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In March 2005, Peter Woicke was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by William Becker. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1998 to 2005, Mr. Woicke worked at the
            International Finance Corporation (IFC) as an advisor to the
            vice president (1998-1999) and as executive vice president
            (1999-2005). Former president James Wolfensohn asked him to
            work on better integrating the Bank and the IFC. When he
            joined the World Bank, the organization was just coming out
            of the Asian crisis. This transcript concerns the role of
            the World Bank Group in advising Asian governments on
            setting up better banking systems, helping them get out of
            the banking crisis.
