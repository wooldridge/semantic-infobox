&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: First I actually came to Agriculture in 1967.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;67. I see.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: I joined secretariat then. We used to call them, actually, the&#13;
provincial--the state governments now--we used to call them not the ministry but the&#13;
agriculture departments. During â&#128;&#153;67, I was just joint secretary in charge of self-&#13;
sufficiency program, green revolution, self-sufficiency. And then from thereâ&#128;&#148;I was&#13;
there for a yearâ&#128;&#148;and then from there I actually switched over to Agricultural&#13;
Development Corporation, member director in charge of [inaudible] issues. I stayed&#13;
there during the pre-liberation days; for about three, four years I was in Agricultural&#13;
Development Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
Then there was the War of Liberation; I was transferred from here to West Pakistan. So&#13;
there on the other side, in Sind, I was Secretary, Agriculture and Rural Development and&#13;
Cooperative also; was there for about two years.&#13;
&#13;
I came back. I was, for about a year, I was Land Reforms Commissioner.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were . . .&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Land Reforms Commissioner. And then actually I came again,&#13;
found myself as Secretary, Agriculture, in 1974-â&#128;&#153;75-â&#128;&#153;76.&#13;
&#13;
Then I had some problems for a short while. For about six months I was chairman, Tele-&#13;
Commission, and then after that actually I was Managing Director, Agricultural&#13;
Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: From Agricultural Development Bank I landed myself in Rural&#13;
Development Cooperatives and Local Governments. There I was for about four, five&#13;
years. Then again came back as Secretary of Agriculture, so continued there for about&#13;
three years, then went to Planning Commission for a short while, Secretary, Planning&#13;
Commission, for about a year, and then from Planning Commission I went to Ministry of&#13;
Defense, and then again came back to Agriculture. And that, actually, that period was the&#13;
most critical and the challenging, and all the controversies were picked up which . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: After you came back from Defense, which year is this?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: From Ministry of Defense to Agriculture again.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, when?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                               November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: That was from â&#128;&#153;86-â&#128;&#152;88. So â&#128;&#153;86-â&#128;&#152;88 was a very critical actual year&#13;
because agricultureâ&#128;&#148;actually the growth rate of agriculture sector was going down like&#13;
anything. So you have heard already aboutâ&#128;&#148;that we had a review. UNDP [United&#13;
Nations Development Program] had a review of how is agriculture performing, what has&#13;
gone wrong.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Just Faaland was involved.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Just Faaland was, yes, my good friend there. Just Faaland was the&#13;
leader. And what can be done about. So that was the time, â&#128;&#153;86-â&#128;&#153;88.&#13;
&#13;
So after--I actually in â&#128;&#153;88 I left. And then I went as Director of Administrative Staff&#13;
College. And then from there I actually retired.&#13;
&#13;
And meanwhile for a short, actually, that I actually left a job, I was appointed to be&#13;
Ambassador to Japan, but actually I had some problems so I had to leave that job. And&#13;
then I was then called as Director, Administrative Staff College, then from there I&#13;
actually retired in 1990. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s all.&#13;
&#13;
So these are the critical days I have seen.&#13;
&#13;
Because the first involvement of the Bankâ&#128;&#148;I started with the Bank as officer on special&#13;
duty for self-sufficiency program in 1967, and that was my first encounter with the Bank.&#13;
And those were the days of massive irrigation expansion. So that was one phase.&#13;
&#13;
Then in â&#128;&#153;74, now when I came back again to Agriculture, the Bank was takingâ&#128;&#148;they had&#13;
continued, actually, the interest in agriculture so they were having projects and the&#13;
programs for agriculture sector. So that was another phase.&#13;
&#13;
And then â&#128;&#153;82, â&#128;&#153;86 or â&#128;&#153;85, that was another phase. And â&#128;&#153;86-â&#128;&#153;88 was.&#13;
&#13;
So you have found--what I have actually found for myself nowâ&#128;&#148;the approach of the&#13;
Bank, â&#128;&#153;67-â&#128;&#153;74, then â&#128;&#153;82 and â&#128;&#152;86, the approach was actually all totally different.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was different?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Yes. So these were the three, actually, I have seen. And I do not&#13;
know what will happen in the future because we are passing â&#128;&#152;88 after this review, sector&#13;
review. In â&#128;&#153;88 we are passing through that period after the review. So this is actuallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
this is my background.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How did these approaches differ, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approaches?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Now, in â&#128;&#153;67 we have not been talking--actually I compare â&#128;&#153;67 and&#13;
the subsequent with the exception of the â&#128;&#153;86 one. It was differentâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#153;82 that it actually&#13;
started, actually in â&#128;&#153;82, actually during this phase. Now what I actually came back and&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
then actually what I found. The philosophical approach now, conceptual, actually, the&#13;
framework, that was actually altogether different. It was more of a projected in â&#128;&#153;67, â&#128;&#153;74&#13;
now, it was more of a projected. In â&#128;&#153;67 now we were actually thinking in terms of&#13;
expanding our irrigation, rapid expansion of irrigation for winter, safe agriculture during&#13;
winter seasons. So we were talking actually project formulation; we were formulating&#13;
projects for the first series of irrigation equipments.&#13;
&#13;
So I was not actually used to the words, what you call actually the â&#128;&#156;conditionality.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Those things were not very much there. The engineers used to comeâ&#128;&#148;I do not know if&#13;
you have any engineers in the company over there so Iâ&#128;&#153;m not actually casting any&#13;
aspersions on thoseâ&#128;&#148;so they used to come, we used to talk more about the engineering&#13;
specifications, what should be the specification of the pump, this type of thing, more&#13;
often technical things, actually, we were going more into the technicalities ofâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
engineering technicalities, if I can put it like thatâ&#128;&#148;we were going more into that. So the&#13;
conditionalities, actually we were not used to this type of expression now, neither in â&#128;&#153;67&#13;
nor in â&#128;&#153;74, â&#128;&#152;til we actually nowâ&#128;&#148;and that, actually, we were notâ&#128;&#148;it was not very, very&#13;
loud in 1982, but they were already there. The import policy credit, actually, which used&#13;
to come from the Bank now, and the conditionalities used to, and those conditionalities--&#13;
when I recollect my thoughts in tranquility now what I actually find that the&#13;
conditionalities were already there now and they have taken a final, actually, the form&#13;
through your structural adjustment, this, that and the other, in â&#128;&#153;86.&#13;
&#13;
So from â&#128;&#153;82 actually there was a significant shift, that you were not providing actually the&#13;
credit for actually the project, for the purpose of buying actually hardware from abroad,&#13;
for the purpose of building construction, this, that and the other now. But we were&#13;
actually cost-sharing philosophically and conceptually; the Bank was cost-sharing the&#13;
desirability or otherwise of many of these things, that what should beâ&#128;&#148;their policy, of&#13;
course, now if I may again [inaudible]â&#128;&#148;so this changed now in a broader way, what I&#13;
may say, that in â&#128;&#152;67 this was more of a projected.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Projects, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Meant particularly for the purpose of hardwares from abroad and&#13;
then we can substitute local expenditures on construction of infrastructural facilities for&#13;
the use of those hardwares within the country. So that was the basic thrust in the field of&#13;
1967 right up to 1982. It became more prominent in actually â&#128;&#152;86, but now from â&#128;&#153;82&#13;
onward nowâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#153;82 it was coming very quietly.&#13;
&#13;
We had not realizedâ&#128;&#148;I had not realizedâ&#128;&#148;I actually understood actually the implications&#13;
of the cost of substitution. Is it desirable? In â&#128;&#153;82 now I perceive that we shall have to&#13;
gradually withdraw subsidy both from irrigation, seeds, from all the agriculture&#13;
industries, then the task for actually the privatization, that we shall have to gradually&#13;
move for the privatization of this agricultural input trade. This was in the hands of a&#13;
public sector organization, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation. So when&#13;
the Bank started raising these cautions now, raising the actually--questioning, the Bank&#13;
was questioning the desirability of keeping it in the hands of a public sector agency, the&#13;
&#13;
                                   A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                               November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
distribution of agricultural inputs, then the question of subsidy and all the philosophical&#13;
issues were coming. So this is the difference, if Iâ&#128;&#153;m actuallyâ&#128;&#148;so the difference between&#13;
â&#128;&#153;67, the qualitative difference between the â&#128;&#153;67 and â&#128;&#153;82 was this. So this is actually just to&#13;
answer your question.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: This is actually what I haveâ&#128;&#148;we have seen.&#13;
&#13;
Now, if you actually [inaudible] what is your claim: now what was actually the impact.&#13;
â&#128;&#153;67 onward now, when we were in that phase nowâ&#128;&#148;this is my again, because now the&#13;
Bank, my friend, you should go and talk to Frank in the Bank now because I have been&#13;
working with Mister Frank Thornley for a long time now. Now it isâ&#128;&#148;you can very&#13;
conveniently--by â&#128;&#156;youâ&#128;&#157; I mean actually not you; I mean the Bank was actually the,&#13;
foreign actually the, persons, foreigners interested in the development of Bangladesh who&#13;
can actually very conveniently shift you, change your position. But it becomes somewhat&#13;
difficult for us now, nationals, to do it because we are very much in the thick of the things&#13;
now, socially, politically and otherwise. And definitely as a bureaucratâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m a&#13;
bureaucrat and I should not have but I cannotâ&#128;&#148;I do not work in a vacuum. I shall have&#13;
to always keep these type political realities, social realities. And it is not a crime on the&#13;
part of a bureaucrat now, a member of the permanent bureaucracy now, to have some sort&#13;
of social and political philosophy of his own. That is very strong, person to person, from&#13;
Secretary to Secretary, but we used to have this.&#13;
&#13;
So that the Bank has changed. This is what actually I now [inaudible] whenever I meet&#13;
now Frank now I tell him, â&#128;&#156;When I was in rural development we used to . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Now we had a number actually of joint commissions now: for minor irrigation with the&#13;
Bank, for agriculture credit and what was theâ&#128;&#148;for agricultural extension research and&#13;
other things. And we have jointly signed that we have--we have argued over a period of&#13;
six months, one year now in the commission as what should be the appropriate approach&#13;
for Bangladesh for the development of cooperatives, for the growth of agricultural credit&#13;
and also for the growth of the agricultural sector. We have argued, but we have adopted&#13;
a particular type of policy now and then made a number of recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
Now what I find and actually what I actually started finding in 1982 onwards now,&#13;
particularly from 1986 now, that there has been a significant departure on their side, but&#13;
we were actually sticking to ourâ&#128;&#148;that the old approach is likely to be useful, more&#13;
appropriate and in that sense more beneficial for us on the question of subsidies, on the&#13;
question of privatization of agricultural activity, input distribution program, on the&#13;
question of institutional framework, now, for providing the backup support for the use of&#13;
hardware, this, that and the other.&#13;
&#13;
So what Frank actually tells me nowadays that he has--there is nothing I actuallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
whenever we meet now I just ask him, â&#128;&#156;This is what you have, we have agreed, and this&#13;
is what you have prescribed and this is what we have gone for. Now all of a sudden I&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
find that you have changed your position, and you are coming up with a new set of&#13;
recommendations, policy recommendations,â&#128;&#157; putting in a straightforward manner.&#13;
&#13;
So he says, â&#128;&#156;There is nothing wrong. The world changes.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Can you give us some examples?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Iâ&#128;&#153;m coming to examples.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to begin with the last one. In 19â&#128;&#148;I was not there; my good friend, you&#13;
may have heard about [A.Z.M.] Obaidullah Khan, he was also; we were colleagues now&#13;
and then he became the Minister also for Agriculture. So Mister Obaidullah Khan, he&#13;
was thenâ&#128;&#148;he succeeded me as Secretary, Agriculture, when I was in Rural Development,&#13;
Cooperative and Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
Then World Bank actually came up for agricultural extension (Iâ&#128;&#153;m picking up the specific&#13;
example here): agricultural extension. We were veryâ&#128;&#148;actually we were aware of that&#13;
agricultural extension plays a very vital role in income generation. [Inaudible] the&#13;
information appropriate type of technologies, but dissemination of that technology to&#13;
actually the poor farmers or the subsistence farmers, small farmers in Bangladeshi&#13;
context is a very important initiative. So we were actually clamoring, so when I entered&#13;
Agriculture in 1966, â&#128;&#152;67 we were aware of the deficiencies, weakness of agricultural&#13;
extension services here in Bangladesh which we have inherited from the colonial days.&#13;
And then we are not very sure now as to how the situation can be corrected. We were&#13;
just actually thinking about it.&#13;
&#13;
Then came the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;actually, thereâ&#128;&#153;s some who was then my good friend,&#13;
actually was the Resident, Leonard Weiss. He actually told me the Bank has adopted a&#13;
new approach for agricultural extension, the T and V [training and visit] system, the&#13;
[Daniel] Benorâ&#128;&#153;s method. And he actually handed over a few, a couple of, actually, the&#13;
literature, a small type of brochure . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, Benor and [James Q.] Harrisonâ&#128;&#153;s . .&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: The Benor-Harrisonâ&#128;&#153;s newspapers now. And initially I was also&#13;
credited. I said, â&#128;&#156;Look, is it also possible for us? Mr. Benor is working now right across&#13;
the border in India, in West Bengal and Rajasthan. Is it possible--I feel quite excited&#13;
about that program.â&#128;&#157; It was very simple. And I actually thought at that stage that we&#13;
may have found the answer, very simple type of answer for a complex type of situation&#13;
over here. And since we have comparable situation, socially, politically and otherwise,&#13;
there in India and here in Bangladesh now, then we would like to get the benefit out of&#13;
that one.&#13;
&#13;
So I requested. Mr. Benor came, and then we were thinking actually of adopting that&#13;
actually system for here. I was then inâ&#128;&#148;actually I was holding, actually, in two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                               November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
capacities. I was--for some time I was Secretary, Agriculture, and Chairman, Agriculture&#13;
Development Corporation, also.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This was about â&#128;&#153;76, â&#128;&#153;77?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: It was in â&#128;&#153;75, â&#128;&#153;76, â&#128;&#153;77, yes.&#13;
&#13;
And then in the meantime Mr. Benor came, and then he spent about seven days over here.&#13;
And then we are thinking--then when we actually went into the details of the whole thing,&#13;
now, then actually something was cropping up into all that we cannot actually blindly&#13;
imitate and transplant that from there, Mr. Benorâ&#128;&#153;s system, right . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Excuse me. You had the Comilla model.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Iâ&#128;&#153;m just coming to that. That Comilla model, actually that was&#13;
uppermost in my mind. So the Comilla model, if you have, you must have--actually the&#13;
Comilla, Mister Akhtar Hameed Khan, because I had been actually now brought up in the&#13;
agriculture and rural development by him. I was very--actually, in â&#128;&#153;67, actually I was&#13;
actually telling him, â&#128;&#156;Actually I am a disciple.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: And I actually agreed with quite a few things. I used to argue a lot&#13;
with him, and then he used to actually tell me that, â&#128;&#156;You are committing mistakes,&#13;
serious mistakes. Now I will not argue with you because you will tell me that I am from&#13;
the other side, West Pakistan, so I want to hold back.â&#128;&#157; But he used to tell me that, â&#128;&#156;The&#13;
time will come. You will repent for it.â&#128;&#157; And I repent, really, actually, repent today that&#13;
what that old man actually told me was actuallyâ&#128;&#148;he was right and I was wrong.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to tell you that what was that specific case now. So agricultural extension.&#13;
So we were actually taught the Comilla model of agricultural extension. Definitely it was&#13;
the typical model. You may have your views that which one is better, which one is&#13;
moreâ&#128;&#148;it isâ&#128;&#148;donâ&#128;&#153;t, actually, theoretically we should not actually come to the question of&#13;
good or bad, better or best, but which is actually better for our situation over here,&#13;
because that man, he developed his modelâ&#128;&#148;you might be knowing itâ&#128;&#148;after spending&#13;
about twenty-three years now, working now. It actually has not grown nowâ&#128;&#148;it has not&#13;
fallen all of a sudden from the heaven now.&#13;
&#13;
And it was very difficult for him because we demonstrate we actually believe in what&#13;
now. We believe in actual deliberations, this is actually what our religion actually teach&#13;
you. You meditate. And this is actually in the Eastern culture [inaudible], in the Indian&#13;
culture also you will find that if you want to find the truth now you must actually retire,&#13;
either into the forest or into--our prophet actually then retired into the cave and actually&#13;
isolated him from the normal actualities of real life and then actually the truth was&#13;
revealed. And this is how actually the old Indian [inaudible] actually were. They were&#13;
meditating now in the forest now, and then they were finding truth. Soâ&#128;&#148;but this is very&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
difficult. You actually do not pick up truth now. You walk between the realities of life&#13;
and then the empiricism, the empirical approach for finding the truth is very much&#13;
missing. But that [inaudible] tell things to us now.&#13;
&#13;
That what Iâ&#128;&#153;m driving at now, that Mister Akhtar Hameed Khan thought the development&#13;
ofâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#153;s actually the model now. He has worked for a long period of years now, from&#13;
the grassroots level. He was actually working as the primary school teacher; he was then&#13;
the headmaster of village school now. Then actually he worked there as the principal of&#13;
Comilla College now. And for what a period of years now, he actually thought that he&#13;
had found a suitableâ&#128;&#148;he actually used to tell me that, â&#128;&#156;Yes, I have found that what is the&#13;
problem of Bangladesh. What within East Pakistan? What is the problem of Bangladesh?&#13;
And then I have actually found that this is the key, Iâ&#128;&#153;m set up that I have worked, I have&#13;
understood the farmers, I have understood the middle class, actually, the farmers I have&#13;
understood actually this, and this is actually what is socially, politically, and culturally in&#13;
our [inaudible].â&#128;&#157; So he developed his, actually, the Comilla, actually, the model of&#13;
extension.&#13;
&#13;
You will find a very good admiration for that; Michigan State invested series of lectures&#13;
delivered. So one lecture actually or three or four actually series are given on, â&#128;&#156;What is&#13;
this Comilla model of extension, and how does it actually differ from the Western&#13;
actually approach for agricultural extension?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So when we were discussingâ&#128;&#148;when I was discussing this thing with Mr. Benor, so that&#13;
was actuallyâ&#128;&#148;so I was having some reservation about that. Yes, some basic, actually,&#13;
the points, the basic truths are there, but that truth will have to be tailored, that shall have&#13;
to be adopted for my purpose over here so that culturally and politically I can assimilate&#13;
actually that thing also over here. So at that stage actually I left.&#13;
&#13;
And then what happened now? Then actually the World Bank now--I am actually with&#13;
an apology now; I am actually using very hard words--actually pushed the project as they&#13;
found it, pushed it down actually our throats now. I used to record--[inaudible] and then&#13;
Dr. Fasih UddinMatab was the minister in those days--so I used to be called occasionally&#13;
reportâ&#128;&#148;when they were formulating the project now for the agricultural extension.&#13;
&#13;
I remember Guy Hunter used to come as the consultant, also. So I used to actually tell,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Look. One thing, that you are telling us for the development of the participants we&#13;
actually [inaudible] agricultural extension. But the project actually you are actually&#13;
giving, it is notâ&#128;&#148;it is actually top-down type of approach, even making the agricultural&#13;
extension bureaucracy more. And the element of actually now the participation will be,&#13;
is likely to beâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid it is likely to be lost.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Because there again also again I actually, what Akhtar Hameed actually taught me now is&#13;
that there is something basically wrong with our educational system over here. Our&#13;
educational system is what? One of my university teachers actually told me that after he&#13;
had seen my actually tutorial script now in sociology, he called me one day and told me&#13;
he was very happy that actually â&#128;&#156;You have actually quoted from James Frazer, this that&#13;
&#13;
                                     A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                 November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and the other, Gordon Childe, so this is good. But I advise you for one thing. So you&#13;
continue to do this thing, but if you want to actually do well, get a good class in the&#13;
university examination, then you shall have to prepare yourself also accordingly.â&#128;&#157; Our&#13;
actual system of examination is such now that I call it actually the â&#128;&#156;commit and homage.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Commit and homage.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Commit and homage. So he actually told me that, â&#128;&#156;You will get&#13;
three hours. Now there will be five questions. And now if you actually nowâ&#128;&#148;lost and if&#13;
you do not come preparedâ&#128;&#148;at least put three actually down, answering three questions.&#13;
You must be ready and you must answer them; you must commit; almost actually you&#13;
must prepare notes. And for the preparation of the notes you must find out who are the&#13;
best boys, collect notes from them, and then prepare your own note. And then you must&#13;
be ready, actually you must memorize almost everything. And first three questions now&#13;
you must actually answer them. And the otherâ&#128;&#148;you actually fiddle with the other two&#13;
questions, so you are out of wisdom and use this, that and the other. I have actually the&#13;
[inaudible].â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So I said that, â&#128;&#156;I know, we know how bureaucracy works. So if we build up a&#13;
bureaucracy like this, the total participatory aspects would be lost.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I tell you actually how it has been lost, what was that. In 19â&#128;&#148;old days now, what was&#13;
before this, actually, the new system was introduced, T and V system, we used to have--&#13;
the total, actually, the strength of the agricultural extension directorate was somewhere in&#13;
the region of 7000. We are not managing well, but there are other reasons for that. That&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;7000 may have been raised to 14,000. But by a single stroke of pen now, through&#13;
actually this, the project Agricultural Extension I, and now we have entered into a third&#13;
phase. And now Frank Thornleyâ&#128;&#148;he was also a party toâ&#128;&#148;this is what I actually, I try to&#13;
tease him now, â&#128;&#156;You actually said they raised it to 35,000.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 35,000.&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: 35,000. And actually brick and mortar, the cars, these new, actually&#13;
the . . .&#13;
&#13;
So I actually said that, â&#128;&#156;This is becoming a top-down type of thing. And then again this&#13;
is becoming--it will actually end into a bureaucracy. And the bureaucracy now, whether&#13;
this is an engineering bureaucracy or the agricultural bureaucracy or the general&#13;
bureaucracy, this is all with the Bank, because you know actually theyâ&#128;&#153;re [inaudible] will&#13;
start operating there. And then you wonâ&#128;&#153;t have the reserves. Now, Mr. Benorâ&#128;&#153;s now&#13;
actuallyâ&#128;&#148;this is actually theme. We are not likely to understand that theme well now.&#13;
And that is likely to be lost.â&#128;&#157; And exactly this is what I feel now that has been, because&#13;
during the subsequent days now I actually haveâ&#128;&#148;a young lady used to come for the&#13;
periodic evaluation of those projects. I used to tell her--because then I came back in â&#128;&#153;82;&#13;
we were then having the second phase of agricultural extension--I used tell her . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                               November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: . . that, â&#128;&#156;What do you actually now leaving in the [inaudible]? This&#13;
is actually my desk. Your project; you have a number of objectives in quantitative terms&#13;
that this will happen, this will happen, this will happen. But when I go actually in the&#13;
field, Iâ&#128;&#153;m telling you that I have [inaudible] I am [inaudible] man, but I actually feel very&#13;
confident now about one thing, that I have not learned agriculture from the Western&#13;
textbooks now. I have actually nowâ&#128;&#148;I have been moving around because I was not a&#13;
desk-bound Agriculture Secretary now. Most of the time I used to actually spend in the&#13;
field. And from there actually I have actuallyâ&#128;&#148;if I have actually now found any wisdom,&#13;
learned anything, then I have learned it from the other end, not from the university end or&#13;
from actually the consultants or the advisers actually there now. I have actually learned it&#13;
from the other end, from the farmersâ&#128;&#153; end, to feel them now.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So I used to tell them that, â&#128;&#156;This is not working well and your objectives are not being&#13;
fulfilled now. This is what actually youâ&#128;&#153;ll find. So what are the reasons? Have you&#13;
actually attempted even now to find out the reasons for this thing now?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I once actually I remember to have once went for the negotiation of a particular project to&#13;
Washington. And then my friend [M.] Syeduzzaman was our Alternate Director in the&#13;
Bank. So I was discussing this problem, and thereâ&#128;&#153;s the evaluation and actually so he&#13;
arranged a meeting with the vice president of that.&#13;
&#13;
So I told him that, â&#128;&#156;This is what you areâ&#128;&#148;how do you actually measure the impact?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So he said that, â&#128;&#156;We all--everything we have, but weâ&#128;&#153;ll measure it after the project is&#13;
completed. And then if you want actually us to measure, then actually my division will&#13;
do it now and you can request and actually when the project . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And so I said, â&#128;&#156;If the project, after actually the project is over, and then if you want to get&#13;
the wisdom for the formulation of the second project, so thatâ&#128;&#153;s good, thatâ&#128;&#153;s better.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was this [W. David] Hopper?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: No, not Hopper. Hopperâ&#128;&#153;s a good friend of mine. No, tall&#13;
gentleman, he has left. It was in â&#128;&#153;78, â&#128;&#153;79.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mervyn Weiner?&#13;
&#13;
ANISUZZAMAN: Ah, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
So this was actually agricultural extension, year now one and two. Now this is not one. I&#13;
find the very frank admission of the same. Now the next, actually, what the Bank is&#13;
actually telling us today that theyâ&#128;&#153;re heading--practically you canâ&#128;&#148;agricultural support&#13;
services, in this name now. They have changed the nomenclature only. Now theyâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
coming up--for all practical purposes it means what is agricultural extension.&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Here now for the phase three. Now if you read actually the appraisal report and they&#13;
have rightly, after a long time, after you have spent millions if not billions of dollars, now&#13;
you have realized that, yes, you have unnecessarily set up a very big bureaucracy. It is&#13;
not cost-effective, and this big bureaucracy is now creating actually the problems hardest&#13;
for the flow of information from here, there, to into the field. And that is why what they&#13;
are suggesting that this shall have to be changed. This is the basic, actually, the message&#13;
that has been conveyed.&#13;
&#13;
And whenâ&#128;&#148;and unfortunately for the Bank and fortunately for me, I came back as the&#13;
Minister. And they were actually--this project was ready for actually the negotiation, and&#13;
I wanted to kill it. So he was trying--he came and saw me that, â&#128;&#156;You cannot do it now. It&#13;
will bring a bad name for the Resident actually, the office over here,â&#128;&#157; this, that and the&#13;
other. So and then there was a compulsion, actually, because we are at the receiving end&#13;
now, so that actually the compulsion was there. So very reluctantly, unwillingly, I had to,&#13;
as a minister also, I had to swallow the bitter pill. And then with a little bit of actuallyâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
send, actually, the team now for the negotiation, and we give them actually the guideline&#13;
that this is what you should try to neutralize there during negotiations. That was not&#13;
there. This never actually happens. Now, I know that duringâ&#128;&#148;the trick of the businessâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
so this has never . . .&#13;
&#13;
So this is what the Bank is saying.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to say the same thing for the agricultural research also. Bank has come with&#13;
the other donors in a deep [inaudible] for agricultural research. Now, what hasâ&#128;&#148;yes, one&#13;
thing Iâ&#128;&#148;because life is always actually the--you have the mixed, you see. If I say that&#13;
no, nothing has happened, we have taken, the Bank has actually given this assistance and&#13;
nothing has happened, this will not be correct, yes, that what we call in Bengali now&#13;
(even I found it [inaudible] English actually idiomatic expression also) that even the&#13;
dark--to quote from actually [inaudible]--even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. So&#13;
this is something like that now. Yes, because it hasâ&#128;&#148;in agricultureâ&#128;&#148;but the basic thing&#13;
has not been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Yes, when, in â&#128;&#153;67 everyone used to complain that the union agricultural assistant (the&#13;
agricultural assistant was the extension worker at that) is not educationally equipped,&#13;
number one, so he cannot actually gain the confidence of the farmers. If the farmers&#13;
come up with a problem now, he cannot prescribe the right type ofâ&#128;&#148;so his credibility is&#13;
gone. And an agriculture extension worker at that level, now, if the farmers actually now&#13;
do not have any faith in him now, if they come with a problem, base problem, and that&#13;
fellow actually neither he knows agriculture--he may have actually spent all his life in the&#13;
urban areas so he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t know--nor if I have not equipped him educationally now, then&#13;
he cannot. The farmers understand it well now, however uneducated, illiterate they might&#13;
be, so they actuallyâ&#128;&#148;they argue in his face, â&#128;&#156;Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a useless fellow.â&#128;&#157; The government&#13;
function, in their eyes, in the eyes of the people now, theyâ&#128;&#153;re actually useless type of&#13;
persons, actually kept by the government for their exploitation. This is what they feel&#13;
now. Let us admit the facts. This is our image in their eyes now, who we want to&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[inaudible]. The credibility is gone. And if the credibility of the agricultural extension is&#13;
gone, then what is the [inaudible]?&#13;
&#13;
So there were two problems. There was another complaint in those days, my initial days,&#13;
that agricultural extensionâ&#128;&#148;actually the assistant of the officer--heâ&#128;&#153;s never available in&#13;
his locality. He used to come toâ&#128;&#148;he usually comes to the district officer once in a while&#13;
for collecting his checks now. That is actually. So we used to argue a lot that, and we&#13;
used to administratively enforce the presence, the twenty-four hours presence, but we&#13;
found that that was a very difficult actually to achieve. And then myâ&#128;&#148;actually, the boss&#13;
was, â&#128;&#153;78, he got training in Pakistan, and so they cameâ&#128;&#148;Hassan [phonetic] used to tell&#13;
me that, â&#128;&#156;You are actually chasing the wild goose now. How canâ&#128;&#148;you cannot actually&#13;
go and visit and enforce their presence now in their locality for--because how can you&#13;
blame them?â&#128;&#157; He used to tell me, in a very pointed way, that, â&#128;&#156;A man now he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
have any roof over his head, he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have any place to stay at that living, he cannot&#13;
hire a house, and you do not pay him enough, there is no actually provision for his&#13;
houses, he has to stay as the guest of actually someone. So how can--he has his family,&#13;
and he has hisâ&#128;&#148;to put it this way, he has the human urges now so how can he actuallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
how can you expect him? You are unnecessarily chasing the wild goose. It will not . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
And I found that it was not producing. If Iâ&#128;&#153;m actually catching him in agricultural&#13;
extension, so he actually used to stay for a couple of months over there. And then he&#13;
used to find out that actually I cannot come back to his station for another five, six&#13;
months. Now I am used to meddling, actually. We worked through the whole thing.&#13;
Awful.&#13;
&#13;
So what were the problems I have covered? My point is I am driving at. Yes, year now&#13;
one and two, it was a mixed package, it has given us something. If I say that it was&#13;
totally actually nothing, that would be aâ&#128;&#148;that would not be real. Yes, so through these&#13;
things, what we have done, we have built the physical presence, we have provided the&#13;
Indian agricultural assistant; he has a beautiful roof over his head. He has been provided&#13;
now through this project, these actually agricultural research, extension and research&#13;
program, now good by any standard, Bangladeshi standard. He has a good house to stay&#13;
over there. We have made him more mobile. We have provided him with a bicycle, this,&#13;
that and the other. Then there used to be a problem now. Actually, heâ&#128;&#153;s actually&#13;
[inaudible] this, that and the other. So that thing has been done. This is an achievement&#13;
and without that actually the project possibly we could not have achieved these things&#13;
with our own local resources for a long, long time to come. So this is an achievement.&#13;
&#13;
But there are other things have been lost. Now, say, agricultural research will make this&#13;
point very clear. Agricultural research nowâ&#128;&#148;I started in 1974; there was nothing.&#13;
Doctor [Kazi M.] Badruddoza, heâ&#128;&#153;s now an emeritus professor here. So we were together&#13;
in Karachi. So he was executive vice chairman Pakistani Agricultural Research Council,&#13;
so he knew well on that. So I told him that nothing is happening in agricultural--research&#13;
is not giving us. We wantâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#148;we are actually short, deficit in what? In edible oil, right?&#13;
So what can be done?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The traditional areas now, where the people live, farmers used to grow groundnuts, in the&#13;
good old days now, in 1930s. Now they have switched over to something else now.&#13;
Theyâ&#128;&#153;re not growing it. So when I actuallyâ&#128;&#148;I just used to inquire of them, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
you grow?â&#128;&#157; Because this is also needed, and in the meantime government now&#13;
investedâ&#128;&#148;we located those areas, and we thought that possibly the marketing is the&#13;
problem. If we can actually just ensure the payment of the economical, reliable price to&#13;
the farmers, farmers will revert. And we set up a very expensive type of groundnut mill&#13;
in the Industrial Development Corporation, but no one wasâ&#128;&#148;because there wasâ&#128;&#148;the raw&#13;
material was not there.&#13;
&#13;
So I was actuallyâ&#128;&#148;I was actually deputy commissioner in that district. During my days I&#13;
used to find that the farmers were growing plenty of early winter groundnuts. Then I&#13;
started talking to the old men I knew, and then they said, â&#128;&#156;Nothing, this will not be done&#13;
because you have taken another action in the program, expansion of irrigation program,&#13;
and then green revolution. Now, in the good old days now, in â&#128;&#152;30s, â&#128;&#152;40s, â&#128;&#152;50s, early â&#128;&#152;60s,&#13;
during winter it was not possible for the farmers to grow anything other than these&#13;
groundnuts which can be grown in the [inaudible] but now you have pushed pawpaws,&#13;
you have pushed [inaudible], you have pushed, actually, and supplying these at a throw-&#13;
away price to the farmers now. And you have given a miracle variety of paddy alsoâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;I&#13;
have eight. Now, you actually--farmers are not fools now. Now the paddy, he can grow&#13;
now with paddy during the dry season also. That what is the yield of the paddy and what&#13;
is the yield of this one? Youâ&#128;&#153;re actually the degenerated, age-old groundnut varieties.&#13;
&#13;
So we get the task that yes, let us do something for the development of a suitable, high-&#13;
yielding variety of groundnut and then possibly we can actually persuade the farmers&#13;
toâ&#128;&#148;and automatically they would be persuaded.&#13;
&#13;
Then we were told that the infrastructural facilities do not exist. Man for--qualified&#13;
manpower we do not have. Then, yes, I started actually pickingâ&#128;&#148;those were very&#13;
difficult days, now, in â&#128;&#153;74â&#128;&#148;USAID [United States Agency for International&#13;
Development], I knew actually LaFew [phonetic], so I told him that, â&#128;&#156;Why not actuallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
why donâ&#128;&#153;t you actuallyâ&#128;&#148;you have taken actually an interest for the development of&#13;
agricultural research in Pakistan and also why donâ&#128;&#153;t you.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So they were saying, â&#128;&#156;Politically the country is not actually, now, it is not the convenient&#13;
time for a massive investment. And then again, you do not have a suitable man; you&#13;
cannot provide leadership also.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So I said, â&#128;&#156;What do you want? If I actually did this Doctor Badruddoza now?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So they actually knew him well now from the Pakistani days. So they said, â&#128;&#156;Yes, that will&#13;
be actually the one hurdle you can cross. If you can guarantee that he will be the&#13;
directorâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;we used to call him the director of agricultural research.&#13;
&#13;
So I said, â&#128;&#156;All right. This is done. He will be.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then they providedâ&#128;&#148;then the World Bank came ARP I, Agricultural Research I, II,&#13;
this that and the other.&#13;
&#13;
But then what? You have not developed technology, test of the [inaudible] meeting,&#13;
technology, actually, whatever they may claimâ&#128;&#148;the research scientistsâ&#128;&#148;that I have&#13;
developed a very good technology, but I used to tell them that actually, â&#128;&#156;Look here.&#13;
Wait. Let me see actually how soon actually it is adopted by the farmers because&#13;
whether the technology you have developed that is good or bad, I will not as an&#13;
administrator, as a layman, [inaudible] man, I will not, I donâ&#128;&#153;t actuallyâ&#128;&#148;donâ&#128;&#153;t tell me&#13;
about, show me your papers, this, that and the other. And high-sounding, actually, donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
come and tell me about your jargons now. I will actually wait for a year or two now to&#13;
find out how fast the farmers are responding to your technology. If the farmer actuallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
the technology you have generated, if it is actually really good, then there is no reason&#13;
why the farmer should not actually respond to it. And if they do not respond, then this is&#13;
a totally actuallyâ&#128;&#148;however good--this may be good for the American farmers or for the&#13;
other farmers, but for my purpose now it is totally useless. I do not pay actually any&#13;
attention to it, your work.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Now, what we found. Plus side? Yes, we have built the infrastructure facilities. We&#13;
have trained manpower. When I started, there were four Ph.D.s of the old days in&#13;
agricultural research; now we have about two, three hundred or maybe even more than&#13;
that, agriculture Ph.D.s now. But are they producing their research? No. Because this is&#13;
what I used to tell my good friends now when they were formulating that, â&#128;&#156;You shall&#13;
have to be very careful about: you take a man for a Ph.D. in the Western universities, he&#13;
cannot interact with his guide over here because for all the many years now, during his&#13;
impressionable age now, he has gone through a process of commit and knowledge&#13;
management, so he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t know how to pick up actually the sensations from the field&#13;
now. We have not actually developed his empirical vision. He has not learned this skill,&#13;
picked up the skill and the art of actually learning from the field, from the realities of life&#13;
now. So these Ph.D.s now, they are not also producing research, and they are not&#13;
generating technologies now which is likely to be useful to the farmers now. They areâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
number one: annual report. â&#128;&#152;Oh, I have done this thing, I have done this thing, I have&#13;
done this thing.â&#128;&#153; When it comes--how far this is actually, has been gone into the field?&#13;
Almost zero.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
During those days actually I could come to knowâ&#128;&#148;this was particularly during my stays,&#13;
actually, I went once to my good friend Stephen Biggs, now. He was Ford Foundation,&#13;
second man over here. He was in CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat&#13;
Improvement Center] there. So he actuallyâ&#128;&#148;I actually from him now I learned the&#13;
concept of participatory agricultural research and development, and he handed over the&#13;
three [inaudible]: â&#128;&#156;You will find answers to all your questions now in that.â&#128;&#157; They call&#13;
them--the publications with the participatory concept of research and agricultural&#13;
development. The opening, actually, the chapters, tells me [inaudible] that--usually the&#13;
donors nowâ&#128;&#148;what actually type of, actually the framework and the design and the&#13;
conceptual framework and the adoption, which has been discarded by the West long after&#13;
the Second World War, and then there has been new things. So the partiesâ&#128;&#148;this is&#13;
&#13;
                                     A. M. Anisuzzaman&#13;
                                 November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
actually the concept of, participatory concept. And this is--they switched over in&#13;
CIMMYT [inaudible] actually that type of thing, too.&#13;
&#13;
So actually I thought that I had foundâ&#128;&#148;so I was telling these things to my friends, that&#13;
this is actually what should be our approach, that you mustâ&#128;&#148;and the farmers are not fools&#13;
now, so that you have read that book now. What is the name of that famousâ&#128;&#148;a classic,&#13;
actually, calledâ&#128;&#148;this was written sometime in 1918â&#128;&#148;Farmers at Forty Centuries. What&#13;
was the name of that professor? [F. H.] King. So I told them that what actually the&#13;
farmersâ&#128;&#148;what he has actually attempted to establish in that actually the whole now, that&#13;
farmers are not fools now. And the farmers have said right, without actually modernâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
actually agricultural science for forty centuries now they have survived. How have they&#13;
survived? What we actually say nowadays now, that the farmers, Chinese farmers&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#148;during, actually, theyâ&#128;&#153;re modern enoughâ&#128;&#148;even, actually, they know, actually,&#13;
they make the best use of the actual resources. They have beenâ&#128;&#148;they know what is&#13;
organic humus, what is this, they actually using the human excreta that for centuries they&#13;
have been using. So who has told them? Because, in actualityâ&#128;&#148;this is why the question&#13;
of survival for them, that they donâ&#128;&#153;t grow enough food in their field now, then they are&#13;
gone. So actually they are actually under the pressure for the sake of survival. And this&#13;
is actually whatever the evolution means, growth, and the survival of the fittest now, so I&#13;
was telling them what we shall have to do, and how this can be developed, this is what&#13;
now . .&#13;
