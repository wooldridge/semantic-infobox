&#13;
1.     THE BANK-NETHERLANDS WATER PARTNERSHIP II ­ WATER SUPPLY AND&#13;
       SANITATION WINDOWS&#13;
&#13;
The main objective of the Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership (BNWP) is to improve the&#13;
delivery of water supply and sanitation services to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The first phase of the program closed its four-year cycle in June 2006. After an&#13;
evaluation of the program was performed, the Government of Netherlands funded the&#13;
second phase of BNWP-WSS with 8 million USD. The program officially started&#13;
implementation on July 1, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
The development goal of BNWP-2 is to contribute to reaching the MDGs on WSS by&#13;
enhancing the impact of World Bank operations through mobilization of practical&#13;
expertise and by implementing innovative approaches at critical stages of the World&#13;
Bank's project preparation and implementation cycle. The program complements&#13;
World Bank operations by providing support to both existing and new projects, and&#13;
strengthens three dimensions of World Bank sectoral assistance:&#13;
&#13;
   · scaling up work on thematic areas which are important, but not yet sufficiently&#13;
       addressed in regional operations;&#13;
   · customizing and implementing improved methods and approaches; and&#13;
   · streamlining the delivery of aid to respond to country needs.&#13;
&#13;
BNWP-2 is managed by the Water Anchor of the Energy, Transport, and Water&#13;
Department. The program is structured in a decentralized manner, by financing&#13;
regional blocks (7) (operational departments) as well as thematic blocks (2). BNWP-2&#13;
funds are complementary to other sources of funding. All block workplan proposals are&#13;
quality-assured through peer-review carried out by water professionals selected from&#13;
within the World Bank and based on their expertise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3. OVERVIEW OF PORTFOLIO&#13;
&#13;
At its third semester of operation, BNWP's approved allocations amounted to&#13;
$3,860,000. Of this allocation, $3,255,0001 or 48% of the entire program's operational2&#13;
budget of $6,800,000 was allocated to the nine operational Blocks.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 1 below shows the breakdown of the portfolio per window for the 9 approved&#13;
blocks and figure 2 depicts the distribution of block allocations ­ both figures are&#13;
relevant to the 18-month workplan cycle (July 1, 2006- December 31, 2007).&#13;

The major focus of the Blocks is on urban issues and basic sanitation. This distribution is&#13;
consistent with the Bank's portfolio in the sector. Demand for basic sanitation has been&#13;
steadily increasing, so does urban water. In addition, certain regions have several other&#13;

trust funds for WSS projects in rural areas, i.e. South Asia, and have provided evidence&#13;
that BNWP-2 funds can leverage more lending if they are to be used for urban activities,&#13;
which are not adequately funded. Still, more efforts will be devoted to generate more&#13;
activities in this area for the second workplan period (January - December 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall, earmarked and actual allocations are evenly spread among regional and&#13;
thematic blocks. Sixty-five percent, or $2,520,000, of the approved $3,860,000 for the first&#13;
18-month workplan cycle is dedicated to the regional water units, enhancing the&#13;
design and implementation of Bank operations.&#13;
&#13;
4. KEY DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
At the early stages of the semester, all Blocks were at their busiest implementation&#13;
phase given the fact that the workplan cycle would end on December 31, 2007.&#13;
Overall, implementation ­ especially towards the second half of the semester ­&#13;
improved considerably during this period. Since most Blocks began to implement their&#13;
workplans towards the end of the second semester for reasons explained in the&#13;
previous report, several Blocks requested a three-month extension until March 31, 2008&#13;
in order to disburse their funds fully. Eventually, all blocks were given a three-month&#13;
extension to ensure that activities would not be completed hastily.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements up to December 31, 2007 including program management costs totaled&#13;
$1.6 million ­ increasing disbursement levels in the last six months by approximately $ 1&#13;
million. Operational commitments totaled $689,488, similar to the previous reporting&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
Out of the $365,000 allocated to regional staff time/ travel, $263,271 was disbursed. On&#13;
December 31, 2007, staff time spent for program management amounted to $218,332 -&#13;
well below the maximum allocated of $240,000. This level is well within the allowable&#13;
15% ceiling of the trust fund.&#13;
&#13;
Due to lack of expressed demand and shifting priorities from the Regions, the&#13;
implementation of the Multi-Sector Projects Support Team Block was cancelled. Some&#13;
of the functions of the Multi-Sector Projects Support Team Block will be implemented&#13;
through the new multi-donor trust fund in the Water Sector (approved by the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands in January 2008) is established.&#13;
&#13;
4.1     Modified Workplans&#13;
&#13;
No new workplans were approved during this semester but some adjustments were&#13;
made to the current ones. These modifications mainly entailed reallocation of already&#13;
approved funds from one country to another as well as cancellation and introduction&#13;
of new components as depicted below:&#13;
&#13;
East Africa (adjusted). The proposed activity in Zambia (Identification of effective&#13;
management arrangements for improving peri-urban water supply services in Lusaka -&#13;
$50,000) was cancelled as the Task Manager was unable to guarantee the&#13;
disbursement of funds by the extended deadline of March 31, 2008 of the first work plan&#13;
cycle. As per the block leader's request, $18,000 of the $50,000 was reallocated to an&#13;
&#13;
                                               3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
activity currently in implementation in Angola (Training of utility operators to quickly&#13;
improve water supply services in urban areas ­ original allocation: $110,000).&#13;
Approximately $32,000 remains unallocated in the East Africa block and will therefore&#13;
be returned to the Water Anchor for reallocation in the second work plan cycle.&#13;
&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Block (adjusted). The second component of the ECA Block&#13;
(Metering and the poor in multi-unit buildings: an analysis to systematically evaluate the&#13;
costs and consequences of different individual and collective metering strategies for&#13;
apartment buildings - $40,000) was cancelled as the trust fund guidelines did not allow&#13;
the purchase of equipment. The local consultant did not have the necessary&#13;
equipment to carry out the metering study and as a result, the component was&#13;
cancelled. At the request of the Block Leader, the funds were reallocated to the first&#13;
component (Serbia, Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyz Republic: Assessing WSS&#13;
services from the household perspective ­ original allocation: $285,000).&#13;
&#13;
East Asia &amp; Pacific Regional Block (adjusted). Due to changing circumstances in the&#13;
country, the activity in Indonesia (Improving WSS service delivery to slum areas in East&#13;
Asia - $90,000) was cancelled and the funds were reallocated to a new component&#13;
(Philippines: Supporting water sector reform). This increase in funds in the Philippines will&#13;
provide additional support and leverage in the ongoing reform process in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Block (adjusted). A small portion of LCR's&#13;
funds was allocated to a new component (Support the design of the Colombian&#13;
government's "Transparent Water" - $18,132). This project is expected to scale up its&#13;
activities and seek further funding from the second workplan cycle of BNWP-2.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Block (adjusted). A new Block Manager took over the Learning Block. A&#13;
modification in the Block's components was approved in October 2007 and due to this&#13;
change, the Learning Block was given an extension until March 31, 2008. By the end of&#13;
December, the Learning Block requested a reduction of funds from $665,000 to&#13;
$350,000 in order to respect the March 31 deadline. The Learning Block is expected to&#13;
reapply for funds needed to continue carrying out some of its activities that were&#13;
initiated in the first workplan cycle but are going to be completed in the next cycle. The&#13;
initial allocation, which was overestimated, was made under the assumption that the&#13;
integration process of the water functions in the Water Anchor would be accompanied&#13;
by a number of specialists. In reality, transfers occurred and the hiring process for the&#13;
Sector Manager took longer than anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
5. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3 and Table 1 below detail the accumulated progress as well as disbursements&#13;
per Block. Total disbursements as of December 31, 2007 reached $1,607,434 - including&#13;
program management costs. Operational commitments totaled $689,488.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Taking into account disbursement and commitment levels, the program's performance&#13;
is 60% (see Figure 4). This percentage will increase considerably in the period January ­&#13;
March 2008, as extensions were discussed and granted for all Blocks.&#13;

5.1Program Management&#13;
&#13;
The program management team continues to monitor disbursements and commitment&#13;
levels of the nine blocks on a monthly basis and reports its findings to the Water&#13;
Anchor's Sector Manager. Follow up discussions with task managers and block leaders&#13;
are taking place to monitor and expedite disbursement and commitment levels.&#13;
&#13;
With the upcoming creation of new multi-donor trust fund in the Water Sector, funds are&#13;
cautiously allocated in order to maximize the amount of money that will eventually be&#13;
pooled into the new MDTF. Since funds that are currently with the Water Anchor or the&#13;
Regional Blocks are not allowed to be transferred to a new MDTF, the program&#13;
management team will allocate exactly as much funds as needed to carry out the&#13;
second workplan cycle in the coming twelve months but not more that what is&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
6. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
&#13;
With the completion of the first work plan cycle, each region provided a preliminary&#13;
completion reports. In this section, some salient lessons learned for each block are&#13;
presented:&#13;
&#13;
East Africa Regional Block ­ Improving Sector Performance and Access to WSS Services&#13;
in Africa&#13;
The focus of this Block's components were on improving implementation strategies and&#13;
building capacity to scale up water supply services in Angola, Ethiopia, Malawi and&#13;
Mozambique. Lessons learned for these countries are as follows:&#13;
   · Patience with governments as they attempt to develop institutional restructuring&#13;
       plans is vital in the success of the reform process.&#13;
   · The task manager of the Angola component emphasized that bringing qualified&#13;
       experts to interact with the client is an integral part of a project's success. Such&#13;
       experts need to have relevant experience and the capacity to listen to client&#13;
       needs. In this way, the World Bank can help clients produce outputs of which&#13;
       clients feel they have ownership and thus increase chances of sustainability.&#13;
   · In Ethiopia, the BNWP consultants identified weaknesses in the initial training&#13;
       materials for town water supply in Ethiopia. A Practitioner's Network Workshop&#13;
       was organized, which underlined the importance of sustaining the practitioner's&#13;
       network beyond the BNWP consultant contract in updating and making use of&#13;
       the training materials.&#13;
   · In Mozambique, building on strong client commitment to sector reform means&#13;
       supporting polices that include private sector participation.&#13;
&#13;
West Africa Regional Block ­ Public Expenditure Review (PER) in the Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Sector in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana and Nigeria (Kaduna State)&#13;
The West Africa Region Block undertook three PERs in Rural WSS. Although the PERs will&#13;
be finalized by March 31, 2008, several lessons can be anticipated:&#13;
   · The PER process offers the best opportunity to engage in a real dialogue on&#13;
       public expenditures with the government and other donors.&#13;
   · Such type of analytical work is greatly appreciated from the clients and the&#13;
       other donors. PERs provide a holistic view of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Lack of data on the level of spending by national and local governments, the&#13;
       governments' volatility and unpredictability over time and the inefficiencies in&#13;
       public spending in Rural WSS have been real obstacles to having an informed&#13;
       policy discussion with the Ministries of Finance.&#13;
    · In the countries under review, financing is not the main issue in Rural WSS for&#13;
       sector development. National capacity and procedures are the main&#13;
       bottlenecks to sector development. Key difficulties are encountered in planning,&#13;
       execution, and procurement and monitoring.&#13;
    · The participatory process used to carry out the PER is excellent and necessary,&#13;
       but it is time consuming and expensive.&#13;
    · PERs are an excellent support to sharpen the content of the policy dialogue and&#13;
       in particular PRSCs regarding Rural WSS sub-sector reforms.&#13;
    (AFTU2 Workplan Completion Report, December 2007.)&#13;
&#13;
East Asia &amp; Pacific Regional Block ­ Improving sector performance and access to WSS&#13;
services in East Asia&#13;
In East Asia and Pacific, three interventions were undertaken covering different stages&#13;
of Bank support (policy advice, lending development and project implementation) and&#13;
different parts of the service delivery cycle (improving utility performance, targeting of&#13;
subsidies, and improving financing of investments). Key lessons from these interventions&#13;
are:&#13;
    · In China, obtaining a broad and comprehensive view of the urban water sector&#13;
       to understand key linkages and external factors is necessary prior to addressing&#13;
       specific policy issues. Another key lesson is using the Bank's analytical work as a&#13;
       mechanism for engaging key policy makers and stakeholders in dialogue is as&#13;
       important as the report itself.&#13;
    · In Vietnam, while the provision of concessional finance through ODA is critical in&#13;
       financing (at more affordable levels) water sector investments, a number of&#13;
       secondary distortions could be introduced, including: the bundling of subsidies&#13;
       with lending makes the amount of subsidy less transparent and the targeting of&#13;
       subsidies, therefore, more difficult. Also, through the availability of ODA,&#13;
       commercial lending to that sector may be less forthcoming as water companies&#13;
       tend to prefer concessional ODA resources compared to (more expensive)&#13;
       commercial financing. However, the results of the BNWP-funded activities help&#13;
       demonstrate that water sector projects can be designed so that some of the&#13;
       distortions mentioned above are addressed without reducing the concessionality&#13;
       of ODA funds. Mechanisms include, inter alia, the splitting of concessional ODA&#13;
       loans into a grant component and a loan at market rates (but lend as one&#13;
       package) and the introduction of incentives for commercial banks to finance&#13;
       ODA funded projects (i.e. through guarantee mechanisms).&#13;
    · In the Philippines, there are still incompatible incentives that can derail the&#13;
       implementation of the reform program. The study of selected financial issues&#13;
       related to LWUA as a consequence of EO 279 (Policy Support) proposes the&#13;
       building blocks of a regulatory body that would help remove the&#13;
       incompatibilities and provide positive signals, mandates and incentives that&#13;
       would help improve system performance. Fulfilling the critical need of a&#13;
       regulatory body would benefit all projects in the sector. In addition, there is&#13;
       borrowing capacity in the Water Districts (WDs) and if other barriers to project&#13;
       preparation and implementation can be taken care of, WDs would be able to&#13;
       borrow to improve their performance and eventually graduate to the private&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       capital market. This improvement would enable LWUA (the leading sector&#13;
       institution) to direct its attention to the weaker WDs. Such a development would&#13;
       have sector-wide benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Regional Block - Improving Interventions in ECA WSS Services&#13;
The Europe and Central Asia Block undertook household surveys of water and&#13;
sanitation service provision in Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Serbia and Tajikistan.&#13;
The study spans rural and urban environments, capturing service provision by utilities&#13;
and by self-supply through community groups or individual households. The survey&#13;
instrument and subsequent analysis focus particularly on the gender dimension of&#13;
service. These surveys provide an up-to-date look at the reality of water and sanitation&#13;
provision, testing the adequacy of the national reporting systems. The preliminary&#13;
analysis of the data is underway. The completion of the analysis, the review of the&#13;
findings and in-country workshops will be completed by March 31, 2008. Therefore, the&#13;
ECA Block could not provide specific lessons learned at the time when this report was&#13;
compiled.&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Block ­ Increasing access to WSS in the Latin&#13;
America and Caribbean Region by enhancing utility performance &amp; innovation&#13;
This Block has attempted to build client capacity and support the preparation of new,&#13;
innovative projects in some of the poorest countries in the Latin America and&#13;
Caribbean Region (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) to help them reach their Millennium&#13;
Development Goals (MDGs) water and sanitation target. It has provided policy support&#13;
and technical advice to implement pro-poor water sector reform; helped strengthen&#13;
decentralization by building the capacity of municipalities to improve service&#13;
operation; enhanced the scope for investments (including PPP opportunities); provide&#13;
seed money for new cutting-edge municipal development initiatives ­ with a strong&#13;
sanitation focus. It is important to note that this Block has reported approximately 1,250&#13;
million USD in leveraged lending through BNWP funds ­ thanks in part to a broader&#13;
based, more opportunistic, just-in-time approach. Lessons learned include the following:&#13;
    · Although the World Bank has already garnered a high level of credibility in the&#13;
       Colombian water sector, its show of support to the "Water for Life" initiative from&#13;
       its inception further strengthened the Bank's relationship with the National&#13;
       Government. The Bank was also able to use its convening power, and wide&#13;
       network of professionals, to bring just-in time policy advice and to leverage a&#13;
       large lending operation.&#13;
    · In Argentina, the due diligence exercise examined the regulatory framework&#13;
       and corporate governance of newly formed water supply and sanitation utility&#13;
       (AySA), and proposed mechanisms to enhance the financial efficiency and&#13;
       sustainability of investments. This exercise was critical in identifying the most&#13;
       appropriate institutional structure for a very important and strategic project to&#13;
       ensure that the large-scale expansion of the sewerage network is carried out in&#13;
       an efficient and sustainable manner.&#13;
    · In Paraguay, government leadership has once again proven essential for sector&#13;
       reform to move forward and materialize. Overly optimistic and complicated&#13;
       reforms are much more difficult to materialize than modest concrete steps. In&#13;
       terms of works, for a water utility to execute a substantial investment program,&#13;
       adequate consideration needs to be given to financial sustainability and to the&#13;
       capacity for operating and maintaining such investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Middle East and North Africa Regional Block ­ No lessons learned could be extracted&#13;
when this report was completed as the MNA block is not expected to complete any of&#13;
its activities before March 31, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
South Asia Block ­ No lessons learned could be extracted when this report was&#13;
compiled as most of the activities in South Asia are going to be completed in March,&#13;
2008.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation &amp; Hygiene Block (SWAT) ­ As the SWAT Block's operations are ongoing,&#13;
lessons learned will be reported at the end of the second of phase of BNWP.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Block&#13;
The Learning Block's aim was to support and reinforce country specific activities, some&#13;
supported by BNWP, by making knowledge sharing on successful approaches to&#13;
scaling up improved WSS service readily accessible to regional task teams and more&#13;
broadly, to sector practitioners in the developing world. Lessons learned from the&#13;
Block's activities are as follows:&#13;
    · Accountability of utilities to users is not a new concept and tools for&#13;
        accountability will not solve all the performance challenges of water supply and&#13;
        sanitation service providers. Unless accountability is addressed as a core element&#13;
        of the organizational development of water utilities, the broader objectives will&#13;
        not be achieved as effectively as they could be.&#13;
    · A systematic approach of guiding principles, through the development of a&#13;
        roadmap, covering the whole cycle of the reform process - from decision&#13;
        making to implementation and consolidation stages - is a useful tool for&#13;
        governments, donors and other partners. Similarly, a template to assess water&#13;
        utility governance can help provide governments with tools to define their own&#13;
        reform packages.&#13;
    · Effective measurement of development is the basis for understanding and&#13;
        applying lessons learned from experience. Over the past year, demand for&#13;
        information on various aspects of sector performance has grown rapidly, driven&#13;
        by the new global agenda for development results.           Bank task teams can&#13;
        benefit from template information and good practice from other project, in&#13;
        order to better focus on managing for results and using information to improve&#13;
        decision making and steer country-led development processes toward clearly&#13;
        defined goals, including the MDGs.&#13;
    · There is a strong interest in BNWP knowledge products. Structured dissemination&#13;
        and capacity building efforts can help spread the word and implement the&#13;
        useful lessons learned from the first phase of BNWP-1. The return on investment of&#13;
        these kinds of activities is high as with a small budget the impact of knowledge&#13;
        work is multiplied.&#13;
&#13;
7. NEXT STEPS&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned earlier, BNWP-2 has just completed its first 18-month workplan cycle. In&#13;
early 2008, a new call for proposals will be issued.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Efforts in the next six months will concentrate on:&#13;
  a.    Ensuring that all completion reports for the 1st workplan cycle are received.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
b. Closely monitoring disbursements of all Blocks to ensure disbursement of first&#13;
   workplan cycle allocations by March 31, 2008.&#13;
c. Reclaiming funds from all Blocks that are not committed by January 31, 2008.&#13;
d. Approving all new proposals within 1-2 weeks and making funds available to&#13;
   Blocks in a timely manner so as to avoid any gaps in funding or delays in&#13;
   implementation.&#13;
e. Reviewing outputs from the 1st workplan cycle and assessing their quality.&#13;
f. Posting relevant completion summary reports and outputs on the BNWP website.&#13;
g. Promoting better program synergies by combining the management structures&#13;
   of BNWPP and BNWP in a new multi-donor trust-fund.&#13;
h. Centralizing knowledge management functions to improve internal and external&#13;
   dissemination strategies of BNWP activities.&#13;

            This Semi-Annual Progress Report
            outlines the progress of the Water Supply and Sanitation
            windows of the Second Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership
            during the first semester of its implementation, which
            covers the period July - December 2007. The development goal
            of BNWP-2 is to contribute to reaching the MDGs on water
            supply and sanitation by enhancing the impact of World Bank
            operations through mobilization of practical expertise and
            by implementing innovative approaches at critical stages of
            the World Bank's project preparation and implementation
            cycle. The program complements World Bank operations by
            providing support to both existing and new projects, and
            strengthens three dimensions of World Bank sectoral
            assistance: a) scaling up work on thematic areas which are
            important, but not yet sufficiently addressed in regional
            operations; b) customizing and implementing improved methods
            and approaches; and c) streamlining the delivery of aid to
            respond to country needs. The first phase of the program
            closed its four-year cycle in June 2006. After an evaluation
            of the program was performed, the Government of Netherlands
            funded the second phase of BNWP-WSS. The program officially
            started implementation on July 1, 2006.
