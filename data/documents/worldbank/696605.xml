REPUBIUC OF CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
L INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of Cape Verde has requested IDA's assistance in financing a program to&#13;
implement an export-led development strategy and to create an environment conducive to private&#13;
sector growth by removing obstacles to the development of private enterprises, providing support&#13;
to private sector institutions, and liberalizing and expanding the financial system. This strategy is&#13;
set out in the Government's Letter of Private Sector Development Policy (Annex&amp;  . The&#13;
proposed project would finance: (a) a program to strengthen the institutions supporting the&#13;
private sector, (b) the development of Mindelo's export-processing zone; and (c) a program to&#13;
strengthen the financial system.&#13;
1.2   Total project costs are estimated at about US$12.7 million equivalent, net of taxes and&#13;
duties, of which IDA would finance about US$11.4 million equivalent. The Government would&#13;
contribute about US$1.3 million equivalent.&#13;
IL SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1   Cape Verde consists of ten islands located 650 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, with a&#13;
land area of about 4,036 square kilometers. Only nine of the islands are populated, with half of&#13;
the resident population of about 400,000 (in 1992) living on the island of Santiago, mainly in&#13;
Praia, the capital city. Only one tenth of the country's land base is arable, which implies a high&#13;
population density (808 persons) per square kilometer of arable land. The Sahelian climate, with&#13;
prolonged periods of drought, a marked shortage of fresh water supplies in terms of rivers and&#13;
springs, and a high natural population growth rate of 2.7% combine to produce intolerable&#13;
pressure on the country's fragile agricultural base. Even in good rain years, the country can only&#13;
produce 10 to 15% of its total cereal requirements. The poor natural resource base, particularly&#13;
with respect to fresh water, and the absence of a mineral resource base, have led to high rates of&#13;
emigration, driven even higher in times of drought. As a result, twice as many Cape Verdeans live&#13;
abroad as on the islands.&#13;
2.2   Development Constraints. Cape Verde's development is hindered by poor natural&#13;
resources, prolonged cycles of drought, and small domestic markets. Moreover, the scattered&#13;
nature of the islands results in costly conmmunications. After independence in 1975, the&#13;
development of a virtualy nonexistent economy into a modern one was a formidable challenge for&#13;
the government which chose to perform the role of an entrepreneur in agriculture, industry and&#13;
services. Reliance on the private sector was not actively pursued. The government sought&#13;
official development assistance and allocated it to the development of public enterprises in key&#13;
sectors. The strategy of creating public enterprises to produce for the limited domestic market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
adversely affected the efficiency and competitiveness of the national economy. This option&#13;
deterred both foreign and private investment for years.&#13;
2.3   Structure of the Economy. Cape Verde's economy has been traditionally based on&#13;
services. The paucity of natural resources, excepting the ocean and an extensive coastline, means&#13;
that services, rather than agriculture, have been the mainstay of the economy. In the 1980s, the&#13;
service sector accounted for 60% of GDP and employed about 41% of the active population.&#13;
Commerce, transport, and public services accounted for 47% of value added. Tourism, however,&#13;
is still in too nascent a form to contribute significantly to value added, job creation and export&#13;
earnings. Construction and industrial production, consisting largely of light manufacturing, fish&#13;
processing and artisanal production, accounted for about 11.5 and 6.5% of the total value added&#13;
respectively in the 1980s. The primary sector contributed only about 13% of GDP because of&#13;
low agricultural potential and inefficient exploitation of reasonably well endowed fishery&#13;
resources (3% of value added) by a public sector dominated industry. The primary sector&#13;
employed about 30% of the active population, of which agriculture employed about 24%.&#13;
2.4   External Sector. Foreign trade is characterized by modest merchandise export earnings,&#13;
a high share of services in total exports, and high merchandise imports. The merchandise export&#13;
base is very small in value and diversity of exportable. Export earnings come predominantly from&#13;
exports of fish and bananas. Non-traditional exports have marginal importance. Traditionally&#13;
Cape Verde's most substantial export earnings come from non-factor services rendered to&#13;
international maritime transport, and more recently from international air traffic services.&#13;
Maritime services are provided through the port of Mindelo, and air services through Sal&#13;
international airport. The economy is highly dependent on imports of food, capital, and&#13;
intermediary goods. Emigration is the principal pressure release valve on the Cape Verdean&#13;
economy. Emigration is also seen as a key means of escape from poverty. At the same time,&#13;
remnittances of emigrants play an important role in the economy and poverty reduction. The&#13;
regular flow of remittances is facilitated by confidence in macro-economic management and&#13;
adequate communication and transport infrastructure. Between 1989 and 1992, remittances&#13;
averaged nearly 12% of GDP.&#13;
2.5   The inward-looking policies of the late 1970s and early 1980s proved unsustainable in&#13;
terms of good economic performance. Economic growth fell in 1989 to 3.7% and declined&#13;
further in 1990-92 due to: (a) declines in public investment as a result of completion of some&#13;
major projects and postponement or cancellation of new ones; (b) decrease in demand for&#13;
international maritime and air services; (c) poor agricultural outputs as a result of prolonged&#13;
drought; and (d) deteriorating performance of the public enterprise sector. In 1993, economic&#13;
growth began to recover thanks to higher public investment in economic and social infrastructure&#13;
and some private sector investment, particularly foreign, in light manufacturing and fisheries.&#13;
Preliminary figures indicate a growth of about 4.5%.&#13;
2.6   To address economic and financial imbalances, the post-independence government&#13;
adopted in 1988 an outward-oriented strategy intended to privatize public enterprises and to&#13;
liberalize trade. Prices of domestic and imported consumer goods have been almost fully&#13;
liberalized. A large-scale liberalization of the trade system, which started in late 1991 and was&#13;
successfully broadened in 1992 and 1993, has led to a dynamic growth of imports after many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
years of tight controls. To preserve the living standards of the general population, the&#13;
Government is keeping under import monopoly some essential commodities that are also available&#13;
in the form of food aid. Although the retail prices of these products reflect the actual CIF import&#13;
cost and handling charges, they do not reflect fuly transport and distribution costs to remote&#13;
islands. The GOCV is exploring options to liberalizing the prices of these items. In addition, the&#13;
foreign exchange allocation system has been streamlined. Foreign exchange is presently aDocated&#13;
through the existing commercial banks for all imports, currently covering about 97%  of all&#13;
customs items. The authorities are considering lifting the remaining restrictions on payments and&#13;
transfers for current international transactions. The lack of a natural or mineral resource base,&#13;
combined with surplus labor, dictates a service-oriented, labor-intensive development strategy.&#13;
New legislation governing foreign investment, liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and&#13;
prices, and privatization, aims to channel the economy towards activities such as export-&#13;
processing zones, tourism, offshore banking services, and intermediate labor-intensive industries,&#13;
as well as air and maritime services. The government, through multi and bilateral development&#13;
assistance, is redefining its role as a provider of modern and efficient services in infrastructure&#13;
such as ports, warehouses, and telecommunications.&#13;
B. THE PRIVATE SECITOR&#13;
1. The Business Environment&#13;
2.7   Cape Verde is meagerly endowed with natural resources. However, prospects for private&#13;
sector development are promising, given Cape Verde's special advantages: political stability, a&#13;
physical environment attractive for tourism, a largely unexploited reserve of seafood products, a&#13;
disciplined and relatively well educated labor force and a preferential access to markets in the&#13;
European Union, the USA and the countries of the Economic Community of the West African&#13;
States (ECOWAS). The formal private sector plays a dominant role in import and domestic&#13;
trade, but its contribution is low in manufacturing, tourism and services. The Government has&#13;
expressed its intention to make the private sector the driving force of the economy. Legislation&#13;
has already been enacted to attract foreign enterprises and provide incentives to exports (Annex&#13;
2). Although some major constraints to this development are already being addressed through&#13;
Bank Group projects (paras. 2.48-2.49), much remains to be done to develop the private sector.&#13;
For instance, a number of private enterprises which have been created in recent years by local&#13;
entrepreneurs, targeting both domestic and external markets, are facing difficulties in obtaining&#13;
bank financing and have to cope with burdensome administrative procedures resulting in&#13;
significant delays.&#13;
2.8    A large and growing informal private sector is active in most areas of economic activity.&#13;
However, as many informal sector entrepreneurs are engaged in multiple part-time activities, it is&#13;
difficult to determine with accuracy the size of the sector. A 1992 study of the artisanal sector by&#13;
the ELO estimated that about 23,000 persons were engaed in artisanal activities. According to&#13;
official statistics, 30 to 40% of the active population is employed by microenterprises. The main&#13;
areas of activities are: (a) retail trade, based mainly on imports from the continent (Senegal and&#13;
the Gambia); (b) processing of agricultural and seafood products; (c) fisheries; (d) local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
production of construction materials; (e) classic artisanal activities such as woodworking, shoe-&#13;
making, hairdressing; and (f) small restaurants and bars.&#13;
2.9   The manufacturing sector's contribution to the economy has gradually increased from&#13;
3.7% of GDP in 1980, to 6.8% in 1985, and 8% in 1990. As of 1994, a total of 101 industrial&#13;
enterprises employed 3,300 persons and were categorized as industrial. Of these, 90% were&#13;
privately-owned, and 10% were joint ventures between the Government and private investors.&#13;
Most industrial enterprises are small: only 17% employ more than 50 workers. The private sector&#13;
plays a dominant role in trade which accounts for 20% of GDP and represents one of the most&#13;
developed sectors in Cape Verde. This is a legacy from the colonial era when almost everything&#13;
consumed in the islands was imported from Portugal by traders.&#13;
2.10 Cape Verde's climatic conditions, abundance of beautiful beaches, political stability, and&#13;
proximity by air to major European capitals are important assets for the promotion of tourism.&#13;
Despite its potential, tourism does not play a significant role in the economy and accounts for only&#13;
about 2% of GDP. In 1988, the GOCV decided to give priority to tourism development,&#13;
essentially through the private sector. It is estimated that about 1,300 persons are employed in&#13;
the sector. The occupancy rates of hotels in Sal and Praia range from 60 to 80%.&#13;
2.11   Fisheries, which currently account for less than 3% of GDP, represent another sector in&#13;
which Cape Verde has a natural comparative advantage due to the high-value of fish species in the&#13;
surrounding waters. Artisanal fishing in Cape Verde is predominant, accounting for about 85% of&#13;
all of the fishing activities in the country. About 6% of the sector's total annual catch is&#13;
processed into canned fish products and fish meal. Detailed information on the various sectors is&#13;
presented in Annex 3.&#13;
2. Institutions providing support to the Private Sector&#13;
2.12  Local Institutions. Institutional arrangements reflect the unbalanced role of the public&#13;
and private sector. In an effort to support private sector development, the Government has&#13;
created two institutions, PROMEX and IADE, and the private sector has been organized in a&#13;
nascent form. (Detailed information on these institutions is presented in Annex 4 and summarized&#13;
below). There are also two trade associations: the Associacao Comercial e Agricola de&#13;
Sotavento, which includes commercial enterprises located in the islands of Santiago, Fogo, Brava&#13;
and Maio; and the AssociaVao Comercial, Industrial e Agricola de Barlavento, which includes&#13;
commercial enterprises in the islands of Sao Vicente, Santo Antao, Sao Nicolau, Sal and&#13;
Boavista. In effect, these represent the two main competing centers of economic activity,&#13;
Santiago and Sao Vicente.&#13;
2.13  To provide greater support to the private sector, two chambers of commerce (federated at&#13;
the national level) have been created by grouping professional associations in all sectors of the&#13;
economy (trade, manufacturing, construction, civil engineering, transport and fisheries). The two&#13;
chambers are responsible for developing a public/private partnership and maintaining a dialogue&#13;
with the GOCV regarding the development of the private sector. They are expected to absorb, at&#13;
an appropriate time, some of the services currently provided by government agencies. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
chambers will also be responsible for organizing an annual forum for private enterprises to further&#13;
the dialogue between the Government and the private sector.&#13;
2.14 PROMEX was created in 1990 by the Government, with assistance from the US Agency&#13;
for International Development (USAID), to assist in export promotion and foreign investment&#13;
development. Although withdrawing from Cape Verde at the end of 1995, USAID has&#13;
committed to funding part of PROMEX's operating expenses up to mid-1996. In 1992, the&#13;
Government revised PROMEX's statutes to give the agency sufficient autonomy to enable it to&#13;
fulfill its functions effectively, and PROMEX commenced operations as a one-stop-shop for&#13;
foreign investors. Since then, it has played a significant role in the preparation of various laws&#13;
necessary to facilitate the establishment of foreign investments in Cape Verde and in attracting&#13;
foreign investment to the country. From 1992 to early 1995, PROMEX has attracted five foreign&#13;
enterprises which have invested US$8.5 million in light manufacturing. This has resulted in&#13;
creating 800 jobs. In October 1995, PROMEX absorbed a similar institution (INATUR) that had&#13;
been created in 1993 to promote the tourism sector.&#13;
2.15  IADE was created at the beginning of 1992 with the assistance of the African&#13;
Development Bank for the purpose of developing entrepreneurial capabilities and improving the&#13;
utilization of the installed productive capacity. LADE, which started operating in October 1993, is&#13;
expected mainly to provide assistance to small- and medium-size enterprises in technical, financial,&#13;
commercial, or organizational areas to improve their productivity and their ability to compete in&#13;
domestic and external markets. Until now, IADE has helped very few enterprises. This is due, in&#13;
part, to its operating procedures which are complex and cumbersome.&#13;
3. Sector issues and constraints&#13;
2.16  Despite measures taken by the Government to improve the operating conditions of the&#13;
private sector, several constraints remain:&#13;
2.17 Legal and Regulatory Constraints. One of the predominant constraints concerns the&#13;
procedures for creating and registering a new enterprise. The current legal procedures are&#13;
complex, onerous and time-consuming. Registration involves six separate steps and six separate&#13;
approvals. It takes a minimum of 55 days and requires the payment of approximately 1.7/o of the&#13;
enterprise's capital in registration fees and stamp taxes. These procedures are being reviewed&#13;
within the framework of the Public Sector Reform and Capacity Building Project (Cr. 2566-CV)&#13;
(para. 2.49), and a new simplified system is expected to be implemented by December 1996.&#13;
2.18 Financing. Enterprises find it difficult to obtain support from the banking system to&#13;
finance their investments, even when the projects are sound and the documentation well prepared.&#13;
Even more disturbing is the length of time it takes a bank to reach credit decisions on corporate&#13;
requests. By the time a request is finally approved, the parameters upon which the proposed&#13;
investment were based may have changed significantly. The commercial banking system is not&#13;
equipped for this type of risk financing, and there are no venture capital nor equity participation&#13;
facilities in the country. These issues are being addressed under the proposed project by building&#13;
a capacity in the existing financial institutions (through staff and management training) to make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
them more responsive to the needs of the private sector. Other needed financial vehicles, such as&#13;
venture capital and stock transfer mechanisms (para. 2.36), are being developed by other donors&#13;
(Sweden) in close coordination with IDA.&#13;
2.19 Enterprise Taxation. The fiscal charges levied on enterprises are: 35% tax on profits;&#13;
1% tax on transactions, including salaries of employees; five per thousand sales tax paid to the&#13;
courts on new contracts; 15% tax on salaries for social security; and 3% or 6% tax for workers&#13;
compensation, depending on whether the employee works in an office or at an open air site. In&#13;
addition, shareholders pay a flat rate of 15% on dividends, if distributed. This system is complex&#13;
to administer and burdensome on enterprises. To address this issue, the National Assembly has&#13;
already approved a law simplifying the corporate tax structure and creating a single corporate tax&#13;
rate replacing the cascade of rates applied to businesses. A decree specifying the modalities of the&#13;
implementation of the law, including the tax rates to be applied, has been issued by the&#13;
Government. The simplified tax system has just begun to be implemented and is addressing this&#13;
issue.&#13;
2.20  The Judicial System. At present, business litigation is handled by the civil court system&#13;
with all other types of litigation. This has created a significant judicial backlog resulting in delays&#13;
of one to two years in the adjudication of business disputes, leading to uncertainties in the&#13;
conduct of business operations. To address this issue and streamline the flow of commercial and&#13;
industrial litigation, the ongoing Public Sector Reform and Capacity Building Project is helping to&#13;
strengthen the court system by providing judges with specialized training in commercial litigation.&#13;
2.21  Inter-Island and Long Distance Transportation. Transportation of persons and goods&#13;
between the islands is presently unreliable, erratic and expensive. This also represents a handicap&#13;
for the development of the inter-island tourism industry and the prospective activities of potential&#13;
investors. The development of an efficient and reliable inter-island transport system is therefore&#13;
an important prerequisite for the growth of the private sector. The GOCV has commissioned a&#13;
study to a private consulting firm, NEA Transport Research and Training, on the inter-island&#13;
transportation problems and a diagnostic of ARCA VERDE, the public maritime transportation&#13;
company. The study, financed by the Government, will be completed by July 1996 and will make&#13;
recommendations to address this issue. The GOCV has already decided to disengage ARCA&#13;
VERDE from long-distance transportation, leaving this line of business to private companies.&#13;
ARCA VERDE has sold two of the five long-distance ships it owns and is aggressively seeking&#13;
buyers for the remaining fleet. This would allow ARCA VERDE to concentrate on inter-island&#13;
transportation, while private operators would cover export-import transportation.&#13;
2.22  Technical Skills. While the level of general education is fairly high, there is an acute&#13;
shortage of technical skills in areas important for enterprise operations, such as accounting,&#13;
marketing and personnel management. There is a shortage of skilled staff in hotel operations.&#13;
However, a technical school was built in late 1995 with European Union funds and is now&#13;
operational. The school has started training professionals in civil engineering, construction,&#13;
masonry, accounting and data processing. This is expected to go a long way towards solving the&#13;
shortage of technical skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
4. Government Strategy for Private Sector Development&#13;
2.23 Government Strategy. The Government is pursuing the implementation of a strategy&#13;
that aims at: (a) promoting a strong export-oriented manufacturing sector and developing the&#13;
tourism and fisheries sectors; and (b) taking specific actions to remove obstacles that are impeding&#13;
the growth of domestic private enterprises. The Government's strategy is detailed in a draft&#13;
Letter of Private Sector Development Policy (Annex 1). During negotiations. the Government&#13;
signed the Letter of Private Sector Development Policy, thereby meeting the only condition of&#13;
Board Presentation of the credit.&#13;
2.24  The first element of the strategy includes the following:&#13;
. In manufacturing, the Government intends to attract foreign enterprises to establish&#13;
operations in Cape Verde to take advantage of its relatively low labor costs (one-third of&#13;
those prevailing in Europe) and favorable access to the markets for products such as garments&#13;
and shoes. To implement the Government's export-led development strategy, PROMEX, in&#13;
coordination with the municipality of Mindelo on the island of Sao Vicente, has been&#13;
developing an export-processing zone (EPZ) to provide a location with adequate facilities&#13;
(water, electricity, roads) where foreign firms interested in Cape Verde can establish their&#13;
factories. PROMEX's investment goals for 1995-97 are to attract US$19.0 million in new&#13;
investments that will create 1,200 new jobs and produce US$44.0 million in export revenues.&#13;
At present, two footwear enterprises from Portugal and a seafood-canning factory are&#13;
operational. In addition a garment factory is being built. A study carried out by Plant&#13;
Location International, a subsidiary of Price Waterhouse, stressed that to be successful in its&#13;
efforts to attract foreign firms, Cape Verde must offer investors adequate infrastructure and&#13;
factory space. With the initiation of an active search for investors in Portugal and Asia,&#13;
PROMEX concluded that a critical factor affecting the decision of firms to locate in Cape&#13;
Verde is the availability of standard factory buildings.&#13;
*  In tourism, the Government's objective is to implement its fifteen-year National Development&#13;
Plan for Tourism, 1994-2009 (Piano Nacional de Desenvolvimento do Turismo, PNDT)&#13;
which was prepared by the National Institute for Tourism, (INATUR). The objectives for the&#13;
1994-99 period are to: (a) have 62,000 visitors each year by 1999; (b) have 4,500 hotel rooms&#13;
of international standard, (9,100 beds); (c) increase the average length of stay of tourists from&#13;
5.9 to 8 days; (d) create 11,000 new jobs in the hotel sector; (e) generate foreign exchange&#13;
earnings amounting to USSI 1.0 million during the last year of the plan; (f) promote domestic&#13;
and foreign investments in the sector; and (g) increase inter-island tourism. Thirteen new&#13;
hotel projects, which would add about 1,500 beds to the country's lodging capacity, have&#13;
been identified by private foreign investors with assistance from INATUR. Of these, five have&#13;
already been approved or are under construction.&#13;
* In fisheries, the objective is to develop the fishing fleet to take advantage of the ample marine&#13;
resources which, until now, have not been adequately exploited (para. 2.11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.25   The second element of the Government's strategy focuses on facilitating the&#13;
development of domestic enterprises by improving the business environment in the following&#13;
areas:&#13;
*  Legal and administrative environment. The Government is taking actions geared to&#13;
establishing a legal and administrative environment that is favorable to the operations of&#13;
private enterprises. This includes: revised procedures for creating and registering new&#13;
enterprises (para. 2.17); significant improvements in customs operations which have speeded&#13;
up the clearance of imported goods from two weeks to less than two days; the creation, in&#13;
progress, of a separate commercial jurisdiction within each of the regional courts in order to&#13;
streamline the flow of commercial and industrial litigations (para. 2.20); and strengthening the&#13;
banking sector (para. 2.18).&#13;
*  Institutional support to private enterprises. Two chambers of commerce, one for each&#13;
group of islands (Sotavento and Barlavento), have been created to represent private&#13;
enterprises' interests in trade, manufacturing, construction, civil engineering, transport and&#13;
fisheries (para. 2.13).&#13;
*  Building private/public partnership. The chambers will be responsible for organizing, at&#13;
least twice a year, a forum for private enterprises to further the dialogue between the&#13;
Government and the private sector. The project will provide support for the organization of&#13;
such forums. These forums will give the opportunity to government agencies dealing with&#13;
private sector development and private enterprises to meet and discuss issues concerning the&#13;
private sector.  The resolutions or recommendations made will be incorporated into&#13;
Governnent policies affecting the sector.&#13;
*  Infrastructure. The Government is taking action to remove bottlenecks in the transport&#13;
(para. 2.21) and public utility sectors that are impeding the operations and development of&#13;
private enterprises. Some of the bottlenecks in the public utility sector (high costs of energy&#13;
and water, unavailability of good water, lack of autonomy of the energy company) are being&#13;
addressed either in the on-going restructuring of Electra, or in a proposed Energy/Water&#13;
project expected to be presented to the Board of Directors in September 1997.&#13;
*  Training. Through the creation of a training fund, financed under the Bank Basic Education&#13;
and Training Project (Cr. 2675-CV), the Government is providing resources for improving the&#13;
technical skills of workers.&#13;
2.26 The strategy being implemented is appropriate and, if pursued with determination, should&#13;
begin to produce beneficial results shortly.  In addition to creating employment, foreign&#13;
enterprises settling in Cape Verde will likely heighten the level of technological expertise in the&#13;
country and will contribute to the training of workers. It is also expected that, as the export&#13;
sector grows, additional needs for production and service activities will be generated, resulting in&#13;
further development of domestic enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.27 Recent Performance and Policies. To translate into action its commitment to let the&#13;
private sector play a leading role in the country's economic development, the Government has&#13;
enacted the following measures: the law on Foreign Investments (lei 89/IV/93 of December 13,&#13;
1993), the law on Incentives to Exports (lei 92/1V/93 of December 15, 1993), and the law on&#13;
Export-Processing Zones (lei 991IV/93 of December 31, 1993). Information about these laws is&#13;
presented in Annex 2.&#13;
C. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
1. Overview&#13;
2.28 Cape Verde's financial system consists of the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV), the central&#13;
bank; the Banco Comercial do Atlantico (BCA), and the Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde&#13;
(CECV), the former postal savings bank. There are also two insurance companies: the state-&#13;
owned Companhia de Seguros Garantia (Garantia) and the privately-owned Companhia&#13;
Caboverdiana de Seguros Impar (Impar). The social security services of the former Inslituto de&#13;
Seguros e Previdencia Social (ISPS) were reorganized in 1991 under the Instituto Nacional de&#13;
Previdencia Social (INPS), or Previdencia, within the administrative jurisdiction of the MEC. A&#13;
small rural credit fund, Caixa de Credito Rural (CCR), has recently been established by the MEC.&#13;
As of December 31, 1994, combined gross assets of the financial sector, including the BCV,&#13;
totalled approximately CVE 49 billion (US$664 million). When excluding BCV and insurance&#13;
companies, BCA's assets represent 900/e of the commercial banldng sector. The Government&#13;
aims to reduce BCA's market share to no more than 50%/0 within the next three years through&#13;
Caixa Economica's rapid growth (averaging 30% a year), the entry of foreign banks, and&#13;
downsizing of BCA (Annex 1).&#13;
2.29 The financial sector is poorly developed and suffers from serious macroeconomic&#13;
constraints, including a small domestic market, and an inefficient public sector, heavily dependent&#13;
on treasury financing. Additionally, there are persistent fiscal imbalances, absence of a secure and&#13;
reliable payment system, and lack of an effective regulatory and investment framework to&#13;
stimulate sector and national development. Substantial efforts are currently being devoted to&#13;
revising the legal infrastructure with support from the World Bank under the Public Sector&#13;
Reform and Capacity Building Project (Cr. 2566-CV). The country enjoys a relatively stable&#13;
monetary system which should provide a good basis for the satisfactory operation and gradual&#13;
expansion of a market-oriented financial sector.&#13;
2. Institutional Structure of the Financial Sector&#13;
2.30 The Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) is responsible for conducting monetary policy,&#13;
supervising banks and mnanaging foreign exchange reserves. It falls within the administrative&#13;
purview of the Minister of Economic Coordination. BCV used also to be the country's only&#13;
commercial bank, but under the structural reform progran agreed upon with the World Bank and&#13;
the IMF, the commercial activities of the BCV were transferred in 1993 to a new institution,&#13;
Banco Comercial do Atlantico. Technical advice to support this process was financed under the&#13;
project preparation facility of the proposed Capacity Building Project for Private Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Promotion. The only commercial banking function remaining at the BCV is a small recovery unit&#13;
responsible for collecting residual delinquent private sector commercial loans which were not&#13;
transferred to the Banco Comercial do Atlantico. Although BCV has occasionally exceeded the&#13;
legal limit on government deficit financing (10% of previous year's revenues), its overall approach&#13;
to government credit has traditionally been conservative.&#13;
2.31  The Banco Comercia do Adantico (BCA) was established by the Government in&#13;
September 1993 to assume BCV's former commercial activities, and is the dominant commercial&#13;
bank, holding 900/% of all deposits. The bank's financial condition quickly deteriorated as a result&#13;
of the large amount of problem loans that were transferred to the new bank and of disequilibrium&#13;
in the asset and liability mix. As a result, BCA's initial authorized capital of CVE 500 million&#13;
(US$6.6 million) was rapidly depleted. In January 1995, the GOCV agreed to increase BCA's&#13;
capital by CVE 500 million to be paid in two equal tranches. The first tranche was paid in June&#13;
1995 and the second in December 1995, increasing the capitalization ratio to 10% on a weighted&#13;
risk basis. A detailed analysis of the BCA is provided in Annex 5.&#13;
2.32 Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde (CECV)--created from the former post office savings&#13;
bank and money-transfer organization in 1993--is the second commercial bank, and is wholly&#13;
Government-owned (through the MEC and three public enterprises). Government plans to sell a&#13;
stock issue to the public in early 1996. All remaining shares of the Government will be offered to&#13;
the public by 1997. CECV is rapidly becoming an important institution in the Cape Verdean&#13;
market. The central bank is permitting it to progressively enter new lines of business, including&#13;
international trade transactions, such as letters of credits. Detailed information on its operations&#13;
and financial situation is presented in Annex 5.&#13;
2.33  Cax. de Credito Rura (CCQ. In late 1994, in response to the difficulties of agricultural&#13;
and fishing companies in obtaining bank credit, and in an effort to stimulate rural development,&#13;
the Government authorized the establishment of CCR. CCR has an authorized capital of CVE&#13;
180 million (US$2.4 million), to be totally subscribed by the Government. The capital has yet to&#13;
be fully paid to allow CCR to become completely operational. It is envisioned that CCR will&#13;
coordinate with NGOs and bilateral projects involved in rural credit. The institution has a policy&#13;
of lending at below market rates: 8% for short-, 90/o for medium- and 10%/. for long-term loans,&#13;
while commercial rates are between 9 and 14%, respectively. As stated in its Letter of&#13;
Development Policy, the Government is committed to remove the subsidies, to subject CCR to he&#13;
same credit policies as the other commercial banks, and to divest its shareholding no later than&#13;
December 1997 (Annex 1).&#13;
2.34  The Insurance Sector. Following years of stagnation, domestic insurance activity has&#13;
begun to expand (30%/. in 1993, 15% in 1994). There are two companies, the largest of which,&#13;
Conyanhia de Seguros Garandia (Garanha), is Government-owned, and was created in 1991 to&#13;
assume the commercial insurance business of the former Instituto de Seguros e Previdencia&#13;
Social (ISPS) which had combined commercial and social security activities. It controls about&#13;
two-thirds of the insurance market. Most of this is mandatory motor vehicle coverage (CVE 100&#13;
million) and maritime risk insurance (CVE 107 million). In 1993, earnings, net of increased&#13;
reserves and regulatory provisions, were reported at CVE 20.2 million (USS269,000). Premiums&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
are essentially invested either with the commercial banks (CVE 289 million), or in short-term&#13;
treasury bills (CVE 100 million), which became available during the past year. The company also&#13;
holds a 13% participation in the Caixa Economica and has recently invested in residential real&#13;
estate. The other insurance company, Companhia Caboverdiana de Seguros Inyar (Inpar) is&#13;
privately owned, founded in 1991 as a joint venture between Portuguese (Imperial &amp; Marconi:&#13;
50%) and local investors. On January 1, 1994, Impar was capitalized at CVE 200 million&#13;
(US$2.7 million).&#13;
2.35  The Instituto Nacional de Previdencia Social (INPS, or Previdencia), was formed in&#13;
1990, following the reorganization of ISPS and the transfer of commercial insurance activities to&#13;
Companhia Garantia de Seguros. [NPS manages the social security funds for private sector&#13;
workers, and its services have been expanded to include disability compensation, death benefits,&#13;
and maternity leave. Previdencia is the country's second largest financial institution, after BCA,&#13;
with total assets of CVE 3.8 billion (US$51 million). Recent legislative changes, including&#13;
allowing Previdencia to receive interest on bank deposits, give the potential to become a&#13;
significant force in an expanded financial sector.&#13;
2.36 Other Financial Institutions. A law passed in July 1994 authorized the opening of&#13;
representative offices of foreign banks, subject to specific authorization and highly restrictive&#13;
conditions. Banco Totta e AVores (Lisbon) established a branch office in Praia at the end of 1995,&#13;
and Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Lisbon) opened a representative office in Praia at the end of&#13;
1995. A second law, passed at the end of 1995, authorized the creation of privately-owned&#13;
foreign exchange agencies which can engage in retail trading of foreign bank notes and travelers'&#13;
checks; however, none has yet received an operating license. Over the past year, the IFC has&#13;
financed preliminary studies to organize a leasing company in Cape Verde. They are currently&#13;
working with Banco Fomento Portugal and a group of local investors to organize a privately-&#13;
managed leasing company. To facilitate public enterprise privatization, and to provide additional&#13;
alternatives to investors seeking higher risk returns, GOCV has requested aid from Sweden to&#13;
establish a modest capital market or stock transfer mechanism. A technical implementation&#13;
report was presented to the Government in June 1995. It is anticipated that the proposed bolsa&#13;
de valores will be operational in 1996, and Sweden has agreed to fund the start-up costs.&#13;
2.37 Regulatory Responsibilities. Responsibility for bank regulation and supervision lies with&#13;
BCV under the ultimate authority of the Ministry of Economic Coordination (MEC). Supervision&#13;
of the insurance sector is provided by the Instdto de Segumrs de Cabo Verde (ISCV), which&#13;
was set up for this purpose in 1992 with the liberalization of the insurance industry, under the&#13;
administrative responsibility of the MEC.&#13;
3. Major issues and constraints in the financial system&#13;
2.38  Institutional issues. Institutional weakness and shortage of trained and experienced staff&#13;
are the most important issues in the financial sector, affecting virtualy al the key institutions&#13;
(BCV, BCA, CECV, INPS, and ISCV). All these institutions are either new, or were developed&#13;
in a completely different economic framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
* The BCV in its present form and with its present duties is less than three years old, and&#13;
despite substantial technical support from the IMF and the Banco de Portugal, needs&#13;
strengthening particularly in the areas of banking supervision and financial instrument&#13;
development. In the area of bank regulation and supervision, for example, it has only three&#13;
poorly-trained bank supervisors. It has limited human and technical capacity to assemble&#13;
financial and economic data in support of monetary policy, or to draft regulations and&#13;
legislation to fill the remaining substantial gaps in the prudential regulatory and legal&#13;
framework. The payment system is inadequate and does not provide a reliable support for the&#13;
development of the financial sector. Given the immaturity of the rest of the financial system, it&#13;
is essential that BCV should be able to provide strong professional and innovative leadership.&#13;
* The BCA, the predominant commercial bank, is poorly managed and in serious financial&#13;
distress (see Annex 5). Its future viability can be assured only by a restructured management&#13;
team strengthened with new competent local or expatriate professional bankers, and through&#13;
strong actions designed to change the bank's management, its culture, policies, procedures&#13;
and practices. Areas of particular weaknesses are: internal accounting and administrative&#13;
controls, internal policies and procedures, lending practices, strategic and tactical planning,&#13;
credit and portfolio risk management, asset liability management, financial planning and&#13;
budgeting, foreign exchange risk management, and the management information systems.&#13;
BCA's accounting systems and practices are so inadequate that it is unable to maintain its&#13;
financial accounts properly. External auditors recently could not certify the accounts because&#13;
of the unreliability of the accounting data, and account statements are sent to clients with six-&#13;
to nine-month delays and are often inaccurate. The Management Information System (MIS) is&#13;
not capable of providing even the most basic management information. The broad framework&#13;
for the financial and institutional strengthening of the BCA has been discussed and agreed&#13;
with the GOCV (Annex 5). The main objective is to correct BCA's most serious weaknesses&#13;
in order to proceed with its privatization as soon as possible. With this in mind, an&#13;
experienced commercial banker with twenty years of service with Banco Nacional&#13;
Ultramarino in Portugal was appointed as bank president in February 1995.&#13;
* The poor performance of BCA makes the performance of the smaller commercial bank,&#13;
CECV most critical. This bank has managed to limit involuntary lending, such as overdrafts,&#13;
and has demonstrated a capacity to operate without government interference. It has a low-&#13;
cost structure, dynamic management and well-focused growth objectives. The intention is&#13;
that it should continue to grow fast from its present very limited staffing and institutional base&#13;
to take a larger market share (from BCA) while maintaining this good performance, and with&#13;
a view to rapid privatization. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the&#13;
areas of management policies, procedures and practices (internal controls, lending practices,&#13;
strategic and tactical planning, asset liability management, foreign exchange risk management,&#13;
and management information systems). This implies substantial technical support needs,&#13;
including staff and management training, MIS upgrades, and preparation of business and&#13;
privatization plans.&#13;
* The INPS, which is the second largest financial institution in the country, also requires&#13;
institutional and technical strengthening, even though it is currently in fairly good financial&#13;
health. In 1992, the Government commissioned a study to ILO to review INPS's activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
The study focused on INPS's operations, investment policies, internal controls and staff&#13;
qualifications to meet the mandated goals. The study made a number of recommendations to&#13;
improve INPS's overall efficiency: internal reorganization, strengthening of the investment&#13;
department, improvement of the actuarial capabilities, management and staff training, and&#13;
need for investment diversification. Many of the recommendations of an ILO evaluation in&#13;
1993 still need to be implemented, including those relating to restoring actuarial equilibrium.&#13;
Staff is inadequately trained, both in accounting and social security administration. Upgrades&#13;
are required of the management information system (MIS), relating to software and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
ISCV, the insurance regulatory commission, is not in a position to competently fulfill its&#13;
regulatory mandate due to inadequate and poor quality staffing, poor material resources, and&#13;
lack of enforcement authority, which make the overall supervision of the industry very poor.&#13;
2.39  Interbank payments system. The complete absence of a rapid and reliable interbank&#13;
payments system is a substantial bottleneck to financial sector development, and to the&#13;
development of the private sector. The organization of clearing and settlement functions, the&#13;
efficient transfer of interbank funds, and the institution of risk containment measures all remain to&#13;
be done. Moreover, Cape Verde still does not have the legal and data communications&#13;
infrastructure to allow fast and secure payments in the economy, and facilitate the emergence of&#13;
new payments instruments.&#13;
2.40  There is a serious lack of reliable information to support sound financial sector decisions&#13;
both at commercial banks and the central bank. In commercial banks, this issue is evidenced by&#13;
the lack of a well-functioning credit risk centralization system to allow for an exchange of credit&#13;
information between banks in the credit evaluation process. Such a lack of basic data on&#13;
borrowers affects negatively the central bank's ability to formulate and implement well-thought&#13;
out monetary policies.&#13;
2.41  Legal and regulatory issues. Continuous changes in the financial sector necessitate&#13;
further changes in the regulatory framework in the banking and insurance sectors.&#13;
*  In anticipation of the separation of the commercial and development lending functions from&#13;
the BCV in 1993, a new framework of laws and regulations for the central bank and other&#13;
financial institutions was prepared with cooperation from Banco de Portugal and implemented&#13;
in 1993. With the opening up of the banking sector to foreign competition and the creation of&#13;
new local financial institutions, the current banking laws need updating to reflect the new&#13;
business environment. Major areas of banking regulation that need revision include limits on&#13;
concentration of credit risks, minimum loss provisions, limits on equity participation, limits on&#13;
investment in fixed assets, loans to insiders and connected parties, classification of assets, and&#13;
treatment of interest on non-performing assets. A detailed assessment of the current banking&#13;
regulations and supervisory system is presented in Annex 5.&#13;
* The commercial insurance sector also has some specific regulatory problems. These stem&#13;
from the imposition of a subsidized, mandatory motor vehicle premium rate structure which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
does not reflect the risk in the industry, a lack of support to insurance business practices, and&#13;
the need to clarify reinsurance guidelines.&#13;
4. Government strategy for financial sector reforms&#13;
2.42  Liberalization of Cape Verde's highly regulated financial market has been a primary&#13;
component of the Government's economic reform policy launched in 1990. The strategy adopted&#13;
has included the following basic components: (a) strengthening the role of the BCV;&#13;
(b) promoting a competitive banking industry; (c) broadening private ownership of financial&#13;
institutions; (d) deepening financial intermediation; and (e) reforming the insurance sector.&#13;
2.43  Strengthening BCV's role, by assigning its commercial and development lending&#13;
activities to the BCA and restructuring the BCV as a well-functioning central bank, has been a&#13;
basic objective in the financial sector reform. Following its restructuring, the BCV has focused on&#13;
its primary role of conducting monetary policies and managing foreign reserves. Recently, the&#13;
BCV authorized banks to adjust rates on market supply and demand conditions and to reflect&#13;
credit risk. Also, following BCV restructuring, a strict lending regime has been applied by BCV&#13;
to limit Government's borrowing to 10% of the prior years' revenues. However, additional&#13;
assistance to the Supervision Department is still required, particularly in the areas of on-site&#13;
inspections and enforcement of prudential regulations. To this end, external financial and&#13;
diagnostic audits of the two commercial banks were completed in May 1995, financed by a&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) under this project.&#13;
2.44  Introduction of competition in the commercial banking sector by the establishment of&#13;
BCA and through transformation of the CECV into a full-service bank has been a primary focus&#13;
of banking reform. Initial problems with BCA would be addressed in this project. Competition&#13;
has been further intensified with the opening of a representative office of the Lisbon-based Banco&#13;
Tolla e AVores, which will probably be converted into a full branch or subsidiary. In addition,&#13;
Banco Fomento of Portugal is envisaging to set up a leasing operation which should allow for the&#13;
provision of important new and competitive financial products to serve the expanding needs of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
2.45  Reducing the direct role of Government in the economy by broadening the private&#13;
ownership of financial institutions is another important element of the Government's strategy&#13;
for the development of the financial sector. This follows up on the privatization and restructuring&#13;
of the public enterprise sector which has been a key element of the Government's reform agenda&#13;
and is now accompanied by a public awareness campaign to broaden and deepen the ownership of&#13;
the reforms and diminish the likelihood of a social or political backlash. Privatization of the state-&#13;
owned commercial insurance company and of the commercial banks should help to mobilize&#13;
additional capital resources and support the development of private sector initiatives.&#13;
2.46  In an attempt to absorb the excess liquidity in the financial system and to offer alternative&#13;
investment opportunities to financial institutions, the GOCV issued in early 1995 a series of&#13;
bonds and treasury bills, with assistance from the BCV and the IMF. Of the total amount&#13;
issued, CVE 6 billion (in nominal terms) in treasury bonds (40% up to five years and 60% up to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
30 years) were bought by BCA, while CECV bought about CVE 500 million. The bonds were&#13;
issued at rates ranging between 5 and 10%, with an average of 8.5%.&#13;
2.47 Concerning the reforms of the insurance sector, Government policy is to promote&#13;
competition in order to maximize efficiency. The Government has already separated the publicly-&#13;
owned insurance company from social security insurance activities (para. 2.34), and has opened&#13;
the sector to private and foreign competition. The creation of ISCV, the insurance regulatory&#13;
commission, was a necessary complement to safeguard investors/clients. The Government intends&#13;
to revise the regulatory and supervisory framework to strengthen ISCV. Legislation has been&#13;
passed to promote the increased use of insurance services.&#13;
D. ROLES OF THE BANK GROUP AND DONOR AGENCIES&#13;
2.48 IDA Involvement in the Private and Financial Sectors. IDA has been involved in the&#13;
private and financial sectors through several operations. In the private sector, IDA provided,&#13;
through BCV, a line of credit (now fully disbursed) for the promotion of private industries under&#13;
the Industrial, Finance and Promotion Project (Cr. 1579-CV). The Project Implementation&#13;
Completion Report concluded that the project made an important contribution in financing the&#13;
development of private sector activities. Through the Privatization Technical Assistnce Project&#13;
(Cr. 2377-CV, approved in FY92 in the amount of US$4.2 million equivalent, with a closing date&#13;
of June 1997), IDA is assisting the Government in: (a) reviewing and adapting the legal&#13;
framework to make it more responsive to the private sector's development needs; (b) promoting&#13;
private-sector development in areas offering good prospects for growth and export potential;&#13;
(c) improving the accounting and auditing standards; and (d) privatizing public enterprises.&#13;
2.49 Through the Public Sector Reform and Capacity-Building Project (Cr. 2566-CV,&#13;
approved in FY94 in the amount of US$8.1 million equivalent, with a closing date of Decenber&#13;
1998), IDA is providing assistance in: (a) the revision of commercial and labor legislation;&#13;
(b) specialized training in business law for magistrates and other members of the legal profession;&#13;
(c) the establishment of specialized jurisdictions to dispose of legal disputes; and (d) the provision&#13;
of modern, computerized facilities for specialized legal services dealing with company registry,&#13;
notary services, and other business activities.  The Transport and Infrastructure Project&#13;
(Cr. 2466-CV, approved in FY93 in the amount of US$12.5 equivalent, with a closing date of&#13;
June 1998), is assisting in the removal of several infrastructure bottlenecks interfering with the&#13;
development of the private sector through: (a) the modernization of the port of Porto Grande on&#13;
the Sao Vicente island; and (b) the reorganization of shipping activities under an Action Plan to&#13;
redesign the institutional framework and provide the proper incentives to private ship owners. In&#13;
the fmancial sector, under the Project Preparation Facility of the proposed project, IDA has&#13;
provided assistance to the Government in the design and launching of a strategy which included,&#13;
most notably, the separation of commercial banking and monetary authorities' functions which&#13;
were both originally performed by the BCV.&#13;
2.50 Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proposed project builds&#13;
on lessons learned from the Industrial, Finance and Promotion Project which encountered some&#13;
start-up problems, but achieved its objective of creating the institutional structures needed to&#13;
promote and stimulate the development of the industrial sector. These lessons are: (a) the need to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
create the policy environment and the industrial regulatory framework conducive to accelerating&#13;
the private sector-led industrialization process; and (b) the need to use, to the extent possible,&#13;
private institutions to assist private enterprises. To apply these lessons, the proposed project&#13;
would strengthen the key financial and private sector institutions to allow them to play an active&#13;
role in the development of the private sector. The project also complements the Government's&#13;
effort to improve the legal and regulatory framework currently being undertaken through the&#13;
ongoing Public Sector Reform and Capacity-Building Project.&#13;
2.51  Role of Donor Agencies in Private Sector Development. Several donors are providing&#13;
various forms of assistance to help develop the private sector.  In addition to the Bank's&#13;
Privatization Technical Assistance Project which helps the Government privatize and restructure&#13;
public enterprises, USAID will continue to finance PROMEX's operations until mid-1996&#13;
(although it is withdrawing from Cape Verde), while the African Development Bank and the&#13;
African Development Fund are financing IADE. Other donors have been providing assistance to&#13;
small and medium-size enterprises, as well as for the development of the agricultural and fisheries&#13;
sectors.&#13;
IH. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECT VES, RATIONALE, AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
3.1   Project Objectives. The project's long term development objectives are: (a) employment&#13;
creation in the formal sector; and (b) a well functioning financial sector.  The specific&#13;
implementation objectives are: (a) for the private sector, to enhance the country's foreign&#13;
exchange earnings, attract foreign investments, and improve the performance of private&#13;
enterprises; and (b) for the rinancial sector, to enhance the functioning of the BCV as a&#13;
monetary authority and improve financial intermediation through strengthening of banks and non-&#13;
banking institutions.&#13;
3.2   Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's involvement in the private and financial sectors&#13;
of Cape Verde forms an integral part of the Country Assistance Strategy which was discussed by&#13;
the Board of Executive Directors in February 1993 and is consistent with the Government's&#13;
objective of promoting the private sector as the main vehicle for the country's development. As a&#13;
lender of last resort to supplement assistance from other donors (Caisse Fran aise de&#13;
Developpement, the European Union, Cooperation Luxembourgeoise, USAID, and the Swiss, the&#13;
Norwegian and the Portuguese Governments), IDA's support under the proposed project would&#13;
be critical to the success of Cape Verde's Government program to: (a) develop a strong and&#13;
dynamic private sector; (b) attract foreign investments for export activities; (c) develop the&#13;
potential of its tourism sector; and (d) strengthen the financial sector.&#13;
3.3   Participatory Approach. For the preparation of this project, particular emphasis was&#13;
placed on a participatory approach whereby the identification of major obstacles to the&#13;
development of the private sector was made during extensive consultations and interviews with&#13;
private sector enterprises, individual businessmen, commercial and industrial associations,&#13;
institutions supporting the development of the private sector, commercial banks, and GOCV to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
ensure project ownership and a realistic project implementation approach. The areas and scope&#13;
of intervention, the budget for each component, the implementation schedule, monitoring&#13;
procedures, and performance indicators were also developed through dialogue with key&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPrION&#13;
3.4   The project would provide assistance to the Government of Cape Verde in capacity&#13;
building in the private and financial sectors. In the private sector, the project would support&#13;
PROMEX's efforts to: (a) develop export and tourism activities; (b) establish a video-&#13;
conferencing facility; (c) launch an international marine registry for which Cape Verde has been&#13;
identified as having a clear comparative advantage; and (d) develop the export-processing zone&#13;
(EPZ) in Mindelo. In the financial sector, the project would finance: (a) technical support to&#13;
modernize the macro infrastructure for financial sector operators, including: the design and&#13;
development of an effective payments system; the review and update of the legal framework for&#13;
the financial sector; and assistance to the BCV to strengthen the supervisory function and&#13;
redesign and implement an integrated economic and financial data base; and (b) assistance to&#13;
BCA, CECV, INPS, and ISCV, including training, audits, and management information systems.&#13;
Assistance to both commercial banks will be provided to prepare them for privatization within the&#13;
next three years.&#13;
1. The Private Sector Component (US$5.90 million)&#13;
a. Institutional Support to PROMEX (US$5.45 million)&#13;
(i) Development of export manufacturing activities (US$0.45 million)&#13;
3.5   PROMEX  is the export and investment promotion center responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the Government export-led development strategy (para. 2.14). The project&#13;
would support PROMEX's efforts to help domestic enterprises expand their exports through&#13;
seminars and workshops by training their staff and managers to meet the requirements of export&#13;
activities. Participating enterprises would pay for the training received to ensure appropriate cost&#13;
recovery.  It would also finance studies necessary for the implementation of the export&#13;
development strategy: (a) a study on raw materials for footwear and garment factory; (b) a study&#13;
on Cape Verde's competitiveness in light manuficturing; and (c) market research to promote&#13;
export products. To establish and maintain a satisfiwtory level of technical excellence at&#13;
PROMEXY the project will finance training programs locally and/or abroad for its staff in&#13;
accounting, computer applications, investments, marketing and management. In addition,&#13;
PROMEX will carry out a media campaign to inform the business community about its services&#13;
and the support that it can provide in developping the exports.&#13;
(ii) Devdopment of tourism activities (USS1.32 million)&#13;
3.6   The project would support PROMEX's promotion activities in the tourism sector by&#13;
financing activities to attract foreign investment in the sector, including two promotional&#13;
canpaigns to show Cape Verde's tourism potential to prospective hotel investors and stimulate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
tourism demand for Cape Verde. The latter would include the preparation of promotional&#13;
materials as well as campaigns in the most promising tourism markets, including Portugal, France&#13;
and Germany. The project would also finance the establishment of three information desks for&#13;
tourists in Praia, Mindelo, and Sal (equipment and operating costs) to provide them with maps&#13;
and documentation. Periodic surveys of departing tourists would also be financed to monitor&#13;
their level of satisfaction and maintain hotel services at a high level of quality. The project will&#13;
also finance training of PROMEX staff in tourism promotion activities. Finally, the project would&#13;
finance a one-mile road and amenity enhancement in the area of Santa Maria which, on the island&#13;
of Sal, is targeted for hotel development. These are essential to the actual hotel sites, and have&#13;
been identified by the tourism sector consultants employed by INATUR as necessary prerequisites&#13;
for attracting private investors to develop beach front hotels.&#13;
(iii) Development of an export processing zone (EPZ) in Mindelo&#13;
(US$2.76 million)&#13;
3.7   The development of the EPZ in Mindelo is an essential element in the successful&#13;
implementation of the Government export-led development strategy as the existence of such&#13;
facilities is a key factor in the initial relocation decision for foreign enterprises that are exploring&#13;
alternative locations to establish their production facilities. The value of EPZs as a long-term&#13;
approach to industrial development is a controversial subject. However, Cape Verde is a largely&#13;
unknown offshore manufacturing location seeking to establish itself in competition with locations&#13;
that are well known and/or have already an EPZ and, as discussed in para. 2.24, in the short term,&#13;
the Government will need to act as a catalytic agent for private investment. The objective of this&#13;
sub-component is to make a contribution to the establishment of the EPZ by financing:&#13;
Standard factory buildings. The project would finance: (a) the completion of three factory&#13;
buildings in the export-processing zone of Mindelo (except the cost of the metallic structures&#13;
financed by the Government of Luxembourg on a grant basis)--IDA financing will mostly be&#13;
for the floor preparation, the connections for electricity, water and sewers; and (b) the&#13;
construction of up to four new factory buildings, financed by the IDA credit. will be&#13;
undertaken only after the Luxembourg-financed shells have been rented out (condition of&#13;
disbursement) as evidenced by a firm rental contract which includes a three month non&#13;
refundable deposit or a payment guarantee from a private commercial bank for an equivalent&#13;
amount. The factory shells would be owned by the government who would hand them over to&#13;
PROMEX for management and rental to private enterprises. PROMEX would charge the&#13;
companies using these buildings a fee for rental and for services provided in the EPZ. The&#13;
fees will be calculated in such as way that PROMEX would cover its management and&#13;
operating costs (including the maintenance of facilities) and make a 5-10% profit.&#13;
* In-factory training of workers. To prepare unskilled and unemployed young Cape Verdean&#13;
to acquire needed skills and become readily available for work in the EPZ, the project would&#13;
finance the cost of apprenticeship stipends (about US$57 per month) for 1,200 individuals,&#13;
estimated at US$408,000 over a five-year period, while they undergo in-factory training for a&#13;
total of six months during project implementation. The cost of organizing the training&#13;
(trainers and materials) would be met from the Training Fund of the IDA-financed Basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Education and Training Project (Cr. 2675-CV), approved in FY95. The Training Fund&#13;
finances only part of the cost of training to guarantee a cost-recovery procedure whereby the&#13;
employer takes on an increasingly larger share of the training costs. This Fund is managed by&#13;
a tripartite autonomous board including employers. During negotiations. it was agreed that&#13;
PROMEX will be included in this tripartite autonomous board to ensure effective&#13;
coordination of the in-factory apprenticeship program and other training programs benefiting&#13;
from the Training Fund. A detailed training program for the first year will be finalized prior&#13;
to credit effectiveness. The number of apprentices to be trained is based on estimates&#13;
obtained from firms which have expressed an interest in investing in Cape Verde. Since&#13;
companies would be competing for the same pool of apprentices, incentive payments to&#13;
apprentices in addition to the stipends financed by the project would be borne by private&#13;
companies. The payment of minimum apprenticeship stipends is a common practice in Cape&#13;
Verde where apprenticeship regulation includes this provision. It is also considered necessary&#13;
to attract foreign investors who have to weigh the cost of the relatively low-skilled Cape&#13;
Verdean workers with that of often better trained workers in competitor countries with&#13;
EPZs, such as Morocco and Tunisia.&#13;
Support to PROMEX  for the management of the export-processing zone.  The&#13;
arrangement currently envisioned for the operation of EPZ is as follows: the land and the&#13;
physical infrastructure of the zone will be the property of a real estate company whose&#13;
shareholders will be the GOCV and the Municipality of Mindelo. The management of the&#13;
zone itself will be carried out by PROMEX until the number of companies is sufficient to&#13;
justify the transfer of management responsibilities to a private company on a concession basis.&#13;
The Project will assist PROMEX by financing the initial start up costs for the management of&#13;
the EPZ. Promex has already initiated contacts with several potential export processing zone&#13;
managers and some of them have expressed interest in managing the zone as soon as the&#13;
minimum number of firms is reached, which is expected to be within two years.&#13;
(iv) Establishment of an international marine registry (US$0.24 million)&#13;
3.8   A 1994 study for developing offshore activities, carried out by Nathan Associates with&#13;
USAID financing, concluded that, because of its geographic location, its existing ship repair&#13;
facilities and its long maritime tradition, Cape Verde has a definite comparative advantage for the&#13;
operation of an open international marine registry. The project would help set up such a registry&#13;
in the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy in the Ministry of the Sea, by financing office&#13;
equipment, staff training and additional consultancy services aimed at facilitating the registration&#13;
of shipping companies. The study further recommended to the GOCV to enter into a partnership&#13;
agreement with a firm specialized in the promotion of ship registries. Compensation of the&#13;
partner would be through a profit-sharing arrangement with GOCV. The project would finance&#13;
the hiring of a short-term consultant to assist GOCV to identify and select a partner and negotiate&#13;
the agreement with the selected firm. Once a participation arrangement is made, an action plan&#13;
for the operation and the promotion of the registry will be developed jointly by GOCV and the&#13;
partner. This plan will be submitted for IDA's review and approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
(v) Establishment of a ideo-conferencing facility (US$0. 15 million)&#13;
3.9   Various studies focusing on private sector development in Cape Verde have identified&#13;
international as well as internal communications as one of the main infrastructure obstacles to&#13;
economic activity. Video-conference technology allows real-time virtual meetings to take place&#13;
between two or more sites located anywhere in the world. It is fast developing world-wide as a&#13;
cost-efficient substitute to actual human travel, particularly where international communication is&#13;
involved, as satellite links are insensitive to distance. The use of video-conference is by now&#13;
sufficiently well established in business practices and is part of the communications infrastructure&#13;
that international companies considering locating in Cape Verde would expect. The project&#13;
would finance consultancy services and equipment for the establishment of such facility, to be&#13;
initially owned by the Government and available for use to the private sector on a cost plus basis.&#13;
The facilities would be sold to the private sector as soon as possible.&#13;
(vi) Private sector coordination services (US$0.45 million)&#13;
3.10  To coordinate complementary activities in private sector development supported by a&#13;
number of donors, and to build up long-term capacity, through training, within the permanent&#13;
structures charged with private sector development, the project would help the GOCV set up a&#13;
Private Sector Coordinating Unit (PSCU), within PROMEX, which has a major role to play in&#13;
private sector development and has successfully fulfilled its mandate.  One of the Unit's&#13;
responsibilities during project implementation would be to organize the training of the staff of the&#13;
key stakeholders. This arrangement would permit economies of scale as the PSCU would use&#13;
PROMEX's support capacity. The project would finance the operating expenses of the PSCU,&#13;
including salaries of contractual staff (para. 4.1).&#13;
b. Support To Domestic Enterprises (US$0.53 million)&#13;
3.11  Domestic enterprises suffer from a shortage of technical skills both at the professional and&#13;
the managerial level. This results in low productivity and failure to exploit market opportunities.&#13;
The project would address this urgent need by providing technical support to these enterprises&#13;
through training programs and through management consulting. Both types of assistance would&#13;
be managed by the two chambers of commerce. As enterprises in all sectors of economic&#13;
activities are expected to be affiliated with these institutions, the assistance program would reach&#13;
the majority of the Cape Verdean private sector. Additional actions in support of domestic&#13;
enterprises (i.e. design of a strategy for micro-enterprise development and strengthening of the&#13;
public / private partnership) are also described below.&#13;
* Training. The project would finance training of managers and staff of domestic enterprises&#13;
to improve their capabilities. The first step in designing the training program would consist of&#13;
an assessment by the two chambers of commerce of the training needs of their members. This&#13;
would be a relatively short stock-taking exercise, on the basis of which the training program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
for the first year would be developed. It is expected that, during each quarter, starting in&#13;
September 1996, courses would be given by selected local consultants in at least three areas&#13;
of enterprise operations, such as accounting, marketing and production management.&#13;
Participating enterprises would pay a fee for their staff members attending the courses which&#13;
would ensure the long-term sustainability of the program. The proposed project would&#13;
finance: (a) the setting up and equipment (including computers and video equipment) of the&#13;
training rooms in the two chambers of commerce; and (b) fees of local trainers.&#13;
* Consulting services would be provided to help private enterprises solve their operational&#13;
problems. This could include a wide variety of assignments, for example preparing a&#13;
marketing plan or designing and implementing a cost accounting system. A specific person&#13;
would be designated in each of the two chambers of commerce to manage these services.&#13;
They would be responsible for identifying consultants (individuals and firms) capable of&#13;
providing high quality assistance, receiving requests from enterprises, advising in the selection&#13;
of consultants, reviewing the proposals to ensure that the costs are reasonable, and monitoring&#13;
the assignment. Procurement and selection procedures would be laid down in a procedural&#13;
manual, and subject to Bank and Government scrutiny to ensure transparency. Local&#13;
consultants would be used in the program but, when necessary, foreign consultants would be&#13;
hired. The project would finance part of the cost of the consulting assignment. During&#13;
negtiations. agreement was reached on a cost-sharing formula by which the contribution of&#13;
the enterprises will be as follow: 25% for consultant contracts under US$2.500. 35% for&#13;
contracts between US$2.501 and US$10.000, and 70% for contracts over USS10.000. Any&#13;
enterprise would be eligible for such an assistance only once during the project&#13;
implementation period, and the maximum amount allowed for each eligible beneficiary would&#13;
be US$15,000.&#13;
* During the preparation of this project, consideration was given to include a component to&#13;
assist micro-enterprises. Due to the number of donors already active in this area, it was felt&#13;
that IDA's support would be better utilized by assisting the Government in coordinating&#13;
donors' activities and designing an overall strategy for such enterprises. Therefore, the&#13;
proposed project would help GOCV in this initiative by financing: (a) a seminar on best&#13;
practices for all donors; and (b) specialist services to design a strategy for the informal sector.&#13;
* Forum of enterprises. The two chambers of commerce will organize, at least twice a year, a&#13;
private enterprise forum to help improve the public/private partnership between the GOCV&#13;
and the private sector (para. 2.25). The project would finance seminars and workshops for&#13;
the organization of these forums. The recommendations of the forums will be incorporated by&#13;
the GOCV in the formulation of policies affecting the private sector.&#13;
2. The Financial Sector Component (US$4.35 million)&#13;
3.12 The proposed project would finance advisory services and equipment to: (a) modernize&#13;
the macro infrastructure for financial sector operators, including: (i) the design and development&#13;
of an effective payments system; (ii) the review and updating of the legal framework for the&#13;
financial sector; and (iii) assistance to the BCV to strengthen the supervisory function and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
redesign and implement an integrated economic and financial data base; (b) support the&#13;
institutional development of BCA, CECV, INPS, and ISCV, including training, audits, and&#13;
management information systems; and (c) help the government prepare and implement a plan to&#13;
privatize the two commercial banks no later than December 1998.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that the government will submit for IDA's approval no later than March&#13;
1997, the plan for the privatization of the two banks. A covenant to this effect was agreed upon&#13;
during negotiations. The overall rationale for assistance in this sector is that its inefficiency is a&#13;
major obstacle to private sector development. Moreover, it is based on a sound overall plan for&#13;
the liberalization and privatization of all, except for the regulatory, supervisory, and classic&#13;
central-bank functions of the sector. Support to the two publicly-owned commercial banks is&#13;
justified in view of the fact that they comprise the entire commercial banking sector, and their&#13;
inefficiencies constitute a major constraint to private sector development at the same time that&#13;
they cause major difficulties to the conduct of sound monetary policy. In addition, the program to&#13;
be financed is considered essential to help the Government achieve its objective of privatizing&#13;
both commercial banks within three years, a considerable challenge particularly in the case of&#13;
BCA because of the absolute inadequacy of its financial accounts. To achieve economies of scale,&#13;
the training of staff and managers of all the financial institutions has been consolidated and will be&#13;
given in such a way to avoid duplication and at the same time ensure maximum participation. The&#13;
details of the training program are presented in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
a. Assistance to Banco de Cabo Verde (US$1.46 million)&#13;
3.13    The project would finance:&#13;
&#149; Advisory services and equipment to the BCV to design and implement an effective and&#13;
secure international and domestic payments system. The project would address current&#13;
deficiencies (para. 2.38) by financing: (a) an in-depth study of user needs and corresponding&#13;
required infrastructure; (b) computerization of the payments system clearing house;&#13;
(c) technical services to draft enactments on negotiable instruments and electronic funds&#13;
transfers; and (d) capacity building of the central bank through workshops and training.&#13;
Training for BCV is complementary to the professional training program of the Basic&#13;
Education and Training Project and would follow the same least-cost in-country training&#13;
approach.&#13;
* Advisory services, equipment and training to design and implement an integrated data&#13;
base of economic information. The BCV stores financial and economic information on&#13;
separate computer diskettes. This system does not allow the BCV to get useful financial data&#13;
necessary to have a complete picture of the overall economy. The project would finance&#13;
consultant services and equipment to set up an integrated data base of economic and financial&#13;
information which is necessary to strengthen the monetary management capability of the BCV&#13;
and facilitate the sorting out of statistical data for publication on a regular basis. The IMF is&#13;
supportive of IDA's efforts to assist the GOCV on this initiative.&#13;
*  Advisory services to review the legal infrastructure.  The Public Sector Reform and&#13;
Capacity Building Project (para. 2.49) addresses some legal infrastructure issues, such as&#13;
bankruptcy and collateral issues and the commercial court system. However, it does not deal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
with banking and insurance regulations which, in many respects, needs to be updated (see&#13;
Annex 5). This is the case, in particular, with the Banking Act, the BCV statutes and the&#13;
commercial banking regulations. It will also be necessary to focus on legal constraints for&#13;
recovering commercial claims, the design and implementation of a special law on loan&#13;
recoveries, and insurance investment guidelines as well as reinsurance regulations. These&#13;
activities are being funded through the PPF. The issuance by the Government of banking and&#13;
insurance regulations. acceptable to IDA is a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
*  Advisory services and equipment to develop an effective credit risk centralization&#13;
system. This will provide current data on borrower profiles and delinquencies which will&#13;
support banks in expanding their lending services to creditworthy borrowers. One of the&#13;
problems affecting the condition of commercial banks is the lack of a reliable credit&#13;
information system. Although the banking system is made up of only two major commercial&#13;
banks, it is difficult for one lender to find out other banks' credit experience with same&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
*  Technical support to the BCV in carrying out its supervisory function. This would&#13;
include in-house training of staff in auditing, accounting and commercial banking operations,&#13;
and acquisition of minimal equipment. Given the separation in 1993 of all commercial banking&#13;
functions carried out by BCV from its monetary authority role, there was a need to establish a&#13;
banking supervision department within the BCV to oversee the activities of the commercial&#13;
banking sector. For this purpose, a Banking Supervision Department was established with&#13;
technical collaboration from the Bank of Portugal and the IMF. Currently, the Banking&#13;
Supervision Department has three bank supervisors who are still inadequately trained. These&#13;
and the insurance supervisors will be trained by experienced short term expatriate consultants&#13;
in such a way that they can effectively perform the supervision of both banks and insurance&#13;
companies.&#13;
*  Technical support to the BCV in the areas of monetary policy and development of new&#13;
financial instruments. The project would finance short-term consultancy services in these&#13;
two areas which the Government has singled out as priorities. One special issue to be covered&#13;
by the consultancy services is the treatment of emigrant deposits in a way that preserves this&#13;
important source of funds without negatively affecting the stability and soundness of&#13;
monetary policy. BCV still has limited capacity in formulating sound monetary policy, and the&#13;
paucity of available financial instruments is a limiting factor in financing private enterprise&#13;
development. The terms of reference for this assistance will be developed in close&#13;
coordination with the IMF.&#13;
b. Institutional Strengthening of Banco Comercial do Atlantico (US$1.65 million)&#13;
3.14 Due to the importance of the problems facing BCA, there is a need to implement a far-&#13;
reaching institutional strengthening plan. The Government's plan includes the following sequence&#13;
of actions: (a) strengthening the general management team, through a management contract with&#13;
professional bankers or consulting firm, to assist the current President and providing tailored&#13;
technical support in all areas of commercial lending and banking operations to improve the limited&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
levels of experience of the current staff, including assistance in delinquent credits; (b) appointing a&#13;
new Board of Directors following criteria agreed with IDA is a condition of disbursement: during&#13;
negotiations. agreement was reached on the criteria to ensure that the new Board will comprise&#13;
five persons (of whom at least three are external to BCA) of high professional competence and&#13;
independence): (c) drafting and implementing a comprehensive restructuring plan dealing with&#13;
institutional development issues and financial strengthening, including recapitalization,&#13;
downsizing, and the implementation of a new MIS to prepare for its privatization within two to&#13;
three years; and (d) organizing intensive staff training (in general banking and computer skills).&#13;
The selection of a management contractor according to terms of reference acceptable to IDA is a&#13;
condition of disbursement.&#13;
3.15 The project would finance: (a) the recruitment of a competent management team to work&#13;
with BCA's President; (b) a full diagnostic audit emphasizing both financial and institutional&#13;
aspects (already completed and financed under the PPF) on the basis of which the consultants will&#13;
help management prepare a viable business plan and design the measures needed to strengthen&#13;
management policies and procedures; (c) intensive staff training, provided by short term&#13;
consultants, in banking operations, commercial lending, credit and risk analysis, foreign-exchange&#13;
management, accounting, auditing and internal control, marketing, loan processing and&#13;
monitoring, loan recovery techniques and liquidity management, as well as programs in general&#13;
and financial management for senior staff; (d) finalization of an assessment of the MIS needed to&#13;
implement the institutional strengthening program, and the corresponding needed equipment.&#13;
Final audit reports of the BCA were submitted prior to negotiations. In view of BCA's poor&#13;
record, the Bank has sought commitment from the Government that, pending privatization, it&#13;
would isolate BCA from political pressures and halt new loans to bad creditors (public and&#13;
private). The Government has stated its agreement in the Letter of Private Sector Development&#13;
Policy.&#13;
c. Support to Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde (US$0.63 million)&#13;
3.16 The project would finance:&#13;
*  External audit and privatization plan. Following discussions between the Bank and the&#13;
Government during the appraisal mission, the Government is committed to put up for sale all&#13;
of the shares of CECV during 1996 (Annex 1). A PPF has already financed the audit which&#13;
has revealed weaknesses in management policies and procedures concerning, most notably,&#13;
internal controls, lending practices, strategic and tactical planning, asset Uability management,&#13;
foreign exchange risk management, and management information systems. Some of these&#13;
weaknesses are being addressed by the bank itself The project would finance consultant&#13;
services to assist in designing a privatization plan.&#13;
*  Technical support, management and staff training. To promote competition, in a country&#13;
where the banking system is limited to only two institutions, it is important that both be&#13;
financially sound and well managed. CECV's rapid growth and apparent success to date is&#13;
due to a combination of dynamic management and lack of aggressive competition from the&#13;
BCA. However, to promote the sustainability of this performance, the project would finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
technical support for institutional strengthening in the areas of weaknesses identified above&#13;
and management and staff training in accounting, project lending, general banking operations&#13;
and computer systems (within a single consolidated training program for all the financial&#13;
institutions covered by the project).&#13;
* Management Information System (MIS) and computer equipment. The activities of&#13;
Caixa Economica are currently concentrated in Praia and in Mindelo, but it plans to open, as&#13;
and when economically justifiable, branches and offices on other islands. Its loan portfolio&#13;
doubled from 1993 to 1995. Its MIS has not, however, kept pace with this rapid growth. To&#13;
address this need, the project would provide technical assistance for: (a) finalizing the&#13;
assessment of the upgrades required to accommodate the new management policies and&#13;
procedures and the expansion of activities; (b) upgrading the capacity of the current MIS&#13;
system; and (c) acquiring equipment for two new branch locations expected to start operating&#13;
before privatization.&#13;
d. Support to the Instituto de Seguros de Cabo Verde (US$0.20 million)&#13;
3.17 The project would strengthen ISCV by financing: (a) staff training in supervision of&#13;
insurance companies, actuarial accounting and audit procedures; (b) consultancy services to&#13;
design a new institutional structure, including the possibility of incorporating ISCV into the BCV&#13;
Supervision Department; (c) consulting services to assess existing regulations and proposed&#13;
changes, particularly in the areas of technical and mathematical reserve requirements, investment&#13;
policy, reinsurance guidelines, and adjustment of mandatory prerium rates to accurately reflect&#13;
underlying risk; (d) modest assistance to acquire computer equipment; and (e) revision of the&#13;
insurance sector regulatory framework to bring it into line with the state of development of the&#13;
industry.&#13;
e. Support to the Instituto Nacional de Previdencia Social (US$0.41 Million)&#13;
3.18  The project would help the Government improve INPS's efficiency by financing:&#13;
(a) technical services to implement ILO's recommendations (para. 2.38); (b) staff training,&#13;
primarily in accounting and in MIS use and management; and (c) the purchase of both hardware&#13;
and specially-designed software packages.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
3.19 Estimated Costs. The total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$12.7&#13;
million equivalent, including US$8.8 million (or 69%) in foreign exchange. Physical contingencies&#13;
are estimated at US$0.7 million (6% of base costs). Price contingencies, estimated at US$0.9&#13;
million (7% of base costs), assume an average annual domestic inflation rate of 4%, and a annual&#13;
average foreign inflation rate of 2%. Detailed cost estimates are presented in Annex 7 and are&#13;
sumnumized in Table 3:&#13;

3.20 Financing Plan. The proposed IDA credit of US$11.4 million equivalent would finance&#13;
approximately 90% of total project costs, net of taxes and duties. This amount would cover all of&#13;
the foreign exchange costs (US$8.8 million) in addition to US$2.6 million representing a portion&#13;
of the local costs. The remainder of the local costs (US$1.3 million) would be financed by the&#13;
Government. A PPF in the amount of USS150,000 was approved in September 1992, and an&#13;
increase to US$850,000 was subsequently approved in February 1995.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   The MEC would be accountable for project execution, and implementation of the sub-&#13;
components would be carried out by the respective project beneficiaries: BCV, BCA, CECV,&#13;
ISCV, INPS, chambers of commerce and PROMEX. The PSCU's role would be to: (a) monitor&#13;
the implementation of the various project sub-components by the key stakeholders; (b) coordinate&#13;
training activities financed under the project; (c) prepare periodic reports on the status of&#13;
implementation; (d) maintain the project's accounts; and (e) liaise with IDA and the MEC. For&#13;
the organization of training activities, the PSCU would call upon PROMEX's existing capability&#13;
and, as needed, on outside consultants on a short term basis. The PSCU would have three locally&#13;
recruited staff, including a project coordinator (PC) acceptable to IDA, who would be from the&#13;
private sector or from the community of Cape Verdeans currently working abroad. Due to the&#13;
heavy involvement of most government officials in the ongoing public sector reforms, it is not&#13;
desirable to have a civil servant coordinating the project activities. In addition, because of internal&#13;
budgetary constraints, the GOCV is unable to offer a compensation package attractive to a&#13;
qualified individual. Therefore, to carry out the needed actions, the PSCU staff will be financed&#13;
under the project. Their salaries were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations in order to&#13;
establish the appropriate pay scale. Due to the "one-time shot" nature of the project, there would&#13;
be no need for the PSCU to continue beyond the project implementation period.  The&#13;
establishment of the PSCU. headed by the PC. acceptable to IAD is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness. This implementation arrangement is recommended because of the need to have a&#13;
competent person with relevant project management experience and private sector background to&#13;
ensure a smooth coordination and follow-up on project activities.  Further details on the&#13;
implementation arrangements are presented in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
B. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.2   Project implementation would be carried out on the basis of annual work programs for&#13;
each component, which would provide flexibility in planning and monitoring. The programs&#13;
would be prepared by the heads of the beneficiary institutions in close cooperation with the PC.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that the PC would prepare the annual work&#13;
programs including a budget and procurement plan to be submitted to the Minister of Economic&#13;
Coordination for clearance and to IDA for review and non-objection. along with an evaluation of&#13;
the previous year's work program and budget no later than January 31 of each year. The annual&#13;
work program would include: (a) monitoring the performance indicators detailed in Annex 8 a&#13;
statement of monitorable objectives and a program of activities to be undertaken to reach these&#13;
objectives; (b) dotailed budgets and financing plans, including proposed procurement contracts to&#13;
be financed by the Credit; and (c) training plans. During negotiations. agreement was reached&#13;
with the Government on the detailed work program for the first year of the project. A detailed&#13;
implementation schedule is provided in Annex 9.&#13;
4.3   The PC would prepare concise quarterly reports to IDA on the implementation of each&#13;
project component.  These reports would compare actual and forecast progress.  During&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
negotiations. agreement was reached with the Government on the proiect monitoring and&#13;
performance indicators on the format to be used and on submission to IDA of quarterly reports no&#13;
later than 30 days after the end of each of the first three calendar quarters, and an annual report&#13;
which would include the period ending December 31, to be furnished within two months of year-&#13;
end. These reports would include, inter alia, the agreed monitoring and performance indicators.&#13;
Reporting requirements would begin with the first calendar quarter following credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.4   To review progress in project implementation, and if necessary re-orient implementation,&#13;
agreement was reached during negotiations that IDA and the Government would undertake joint&#13;
yearly reviews and that a mid-term review would be scheduled approximately two years after&#13;
project effectiveness. During negotiations, agreement was also reached that the Government&#13;
would send to IDA for comments, no later than one month prior to each review, a draft progress&#13;
report which would constitute the basis for the reviews. The Government would also prepare and&#13;
send to IDA a project implementation completion report within six months after the closing date.&#13;
An implementation schedule and a supervision plan are in Annex 10. A project launching&#13;
workshop is scheduled to take place within two months after Board approval of the credit.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.5   Procurement.  Procurement arrangements are presented in Table 5. Cape Verde's&#13;
National procurement laws and regulations were reviewed and determined acceptable. Contracts&#13;
for civil works program financed by IDA (totaling US$3.4 million, net of taxes and duties)&#13;
include construction of the road in the tourist zone on Sal Island, the factory shells in the EPZ and&#13;
complementary works on the Luxembourg-financed shells. The contracts for the construction of&#13;
the road, the factory shells and complementary works (totaling US$3.1 million), each estimated to&#13;
cost US$200,000 or more, would be awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB),&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(January 1995), and using Standard Bidding Documents developed by the Bank, while the&#13;
contract for construction of the office (totaling US$0.3 million), each estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000, would be awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) in accordance&#13;
with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.6   Contracts for goods financed by IDA include one vehicle, computer equipment and&#13;
software, other office equipment and supplies, and furniture (totaling US$3.1 million, net of taxes&#13;
and duties). Goods would be grouped into packages of at least US$200,000 each and procured&#13;
through ICB for an estimated total cost of US$2.6 million equivalent, in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995), and&#13;
using standard bidding documents developed by the Bank. Goods procured under contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent each would be suitable for procurement&#13;
through NCB, according to procedures acceptable to IDA, provided the aggregate amount does&#13;
not exceed US$0.4 million. Goods estimated to cost less than US$35,000 per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$50,000, may be procured through national shopping procedures, based on price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers. Vehicle and equipment valued at less&#13;
than US$35,000, up to an aggregate of US$50,000, may be procured through UNDP's Inter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Agency Procurement Services Office (LAPSO). Promotional activities will be procured through&#13;
procedures applicable either for goods or services depending on the nature and type of activities.&#13;

4.7     Specialist services financed by the IDA credit (US$4.0 million) would be contracted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelinesfor the Use of Consaldmts (August 1981). Services to be&#13;
contracted include mainly short-term specialists for technical assistance, training auditing, design&#13;
and implementation of MIS and data base, and studies. The PC would be selected on the basis of&#13;
open competition. Services for management assistance to BCA would be contracted for the first&#13;
two years of project execution on the basis of a short-list of firms. Draft terms of reference for all&#13;
major advisory services and studies were confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
4.8    During negotiations agreement was reached on the use of Standard Bidding Documents.&#13;
letters of invitation for the selection of consultants. and standard consultant contracts. Also,&#13;
during negotiations. the Government reviewed and ageed with IDA on a model consultancy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
contract including a sample letter of invitation, for the recruitment of consultants and advisors&#13;
under the prject.&#13;
4.9   Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold of&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent each would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. In the case of&#13;
consultants, prior review by IDA would be required for all consultancy contracts for individuals&#13;
above a threshold of US$50,000 equivalent, and for firms, above a threshold of US$100,000&#13;
equivalent. Below these thresholds, the Bank would review the terms of reference for all&#13;
contracts, all cases where single source-hiring is proposed, any assignments that it determines to&#13;
be of a critical nature, and any amendments to contracts that would raise their value over these&#13;
thresholds.&#13;
4.10 Disbursements. The project is expected to be completed over a four-year period, and the&#13;
IDA credit disbursed over 5 years, according to the categories shown in Table 6 below. The&#13;
estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 11. AU disbursements of the IDA credit will be&#13;
based on prior documentation, except for: (a) consultant contracts of less than US$50,000 with&#13;
individuals and with firms of less than US$100,000; (b) contracts for works and goods of less&#13;
than US$200,000; (c) contracts for training; and (d) operating costs. Disbursements for these&#13;
items will be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs). Operating costs include salaries of&#13;
contractual personnel of the PSCU and of PROMEX staff involved in the management of the&#13;
EPZ, staff travel, office expenses, rent, and electricity of the PSCU, and operation and&#13;
maintenance of equipment and vehicle. The PC will have responsibility for the preparation of&#13;
withdrawal applications for all components. The documentation for withdrawals under SOEs will&#13;
be retained by the PSCU and the MEC for review by IDA staff during supervision missions and&#13;
for regular semi-annual audits.&#13;
4.11  To expedite disbursements, agreement was reached during negotiations that the&#13;
Government will open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
authorized allocation will be US$500,000 representing IDA's anticipated share of eligible&#13;
expenditures for four months. IDA will make an initial deposit of US$250,000 upon credit&#13;
effectiveness and once US$5,000,000 equivalent are disbursed, the balance of the authorized&#13;
allocation will be advanced to the Special Account. Replenishment of the Special Account will be&#13;
made on the basis of monthly applications supported by full documentation or SOEs, as required.&#13;
Initially, all expenditures less than US$50,000 equivalent will be financed directly from the special&#13;
account and for any expenditure above US$50,000 equivalent, IDA will accept direct payments.&#13;
Once the filll allocation is advanced, this threshold will rise to US$100,000. The Borrower will&#13;
open a Project Account and deposit into it for counterpart funds: (a) an amount equivalent to&#13;
US$100,000 in ECV; and (b) the remaining amount of its counterpart contributions (i.e.,&#13;
quarterly, twice a year, etc.), according to a payment schedule agreed upon between the&#13;
Borrower and IDA. The establishment of this Project Account is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness,&#13;

D. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.12   The PSCU within PROMEX will establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of IDA,&#13;
separate accounts and records to be used exclusively for the project. The accounts will be&#13;
maintained in accordance with sound and internationally accepted accounting principles and&#13;
practices. The PC will provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial&#13;
performance and situation of the project. Independent auditors acceptable to the Association will&#13;
audit the project accounts in accordance with internationally acceptable auditing principles and in&#13;
such details as IDA may request. Establishment of a financial management/accounting system for&#13;
the project. and the selection of auditors under a multi-year contract are conditions of credit&#13;
effectivene. The audits would be undertaken annually and the audit report submitted to IDA&#13;
within six months after the end of each fiscal year. In addition, the Special Account would be&#13;
audited annually, and the SOEs semi-annually, and audit reports would be submitted six months&#13;
after the end of each audit period. During negotiations. agreement was reached that the&#13;
Government will submit to IDA annual audit reports within six months of the end of each fiscal&#13;
year and, for SOEs. submnit semi-annual reports within six months after the end of each audit&#13;
period,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.13  Cape Verde's environment is frale, given: (a) exposure of its predominantly bare soil&#13;
surface to wind and water erosion; and (b) fast growth of urban areas. Inadequate fiesh water&#13;
supply, lack of sanitation and satisfactory systems for collection and disposal of hazardous and&#13;
solid waste pose immediate health hazards for the fast-growing population in the urban areas.&#13;
Environmental problems are weli identified and recognized by the Government which has adopted&#13;
an active approach in carrying out concrete actions to address environmental issues (e.g.,&#13;
allocating increased financial resources to improve urban living conditions, massive reforestation&#13;
efforts, etc.). It has also established an inter-agency National Council of the Environment which&#13;
has embarked on the design of a strategy, a legislative package and an institutional framework to&#13;
deal with environmental issues on a more comprehensive basis. The Bank has assisted this&#13;
process through the preparation of a Country Environmental Strategy Paper. An integral part of&#13;
the Government's active stance on the environment is the preparation of a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan which has already begun. The project does not present the prospect&#13;
of any significant detimental environmental impact. However, to avoid any unnecessary risk, the&#13;
Government has conducted an environmental assessment with assistance from an independent&#13;
consultant to determine the project's impact (particularly the export-processing zone and the&#13;
tourism activities) on the environment. The assessment has confirmed that the project will not&#13;
have a significant adverse impact on the environment.&#13;
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFTS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1   The proposed project would assist the Government in its efforts to promote private sector&#13;
development and modernize the financial system. By supporting PROMEX and the EPZ, the&#13;
project would help develop dynamic export and tourism sectors which are essential elements of&#13;
the Government's economic development strategy. The main benefits are expected to arise from&#13;
job creation in an economy where unemployment is the main problem. Enterprises attracted to&#13;
the EPZ would create employment and contribute to poverty alleviation. Similarly, hotel&#13;
investments by foreigners would facilitate the growth of tourism, also creating employment and&#13;
contributing to foreign exchange earnings. An efficient financial sector would contribute to the&#13;
implementation of an effective monetary and credit policy and to the stability and growth of the&#13;
Cape Verdean economy.  The strengthening of the financial institutions would promote&#13;
competition and increase their efficiency which in turn would improve access to capital, enhance&#13;
domestic resource mobilization, and significantly lower the transaction costs of enterprises. A&#13;
well-functioning financial sector would facilitate the development of the private sector and the&#13;
privatization of public enterprises. The investment in training and expert advice would improve&#13;
local capacity in the financial and private sectors. The Social Security Fund, the Instituto&#13;
Nacional de Preudencia Social, represents an invaluable reservoir of long-term financial&#13;
resources. Accordingly, restoration of its financial health should facilitate the channeling of these&#13;
resources to support economic growth..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
B. EMLOYmNT AND POVERTY ALLEVATION&#13;
5.2   Twenty-three percent of the working-age population of Cape Verde is officially classified&#13;
as "unemployed". The project would contribute to the alleviation of this problem by directly&#13;
creating about 2,700 jobs in the Mindelo's EPZ over a four-year period. It is estimated that a&#13;
similar number of jobs would be created indirectly.  The total employment impact in the&#13;
manufacturing sector would therefore be about 5,500 new jobs. Furthermore, investments in the&#13;
tourism sector and the development of tourism activities should result in the creation of about 750&#13;
directly-generated and some 400 indirectly-generated new jobs. Therefore, the total employment&#13;
impact of the project would amount to some 6,600 new jobs (equivalent to 6% of the country's&#13;
economically active population). Through the creation of employment both in the manufacturing&#13;
and in the tourism sectors, the project would make a significant contribution to the alleviation of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY&#13;
5.3   Cost recovery for the construction of the factory shelHs in Mindelo's EPZ would be&#13;
achieved through the rents charged to enterprises using these facilities. Cost recovery of the&#13;
technical support provided to private enterprises through the chambers of commerce would come&#13;
from the fees charged to these enterprises for participating in the training sessions provided to&#13;
them. For the in-factory training of workers, the Training Fund will finance only part of the cost&#13;
of training to guarantee a cost-recovery procedure whereby the employer takes on an increasing&#13;
large share of the training costs.&#13;
D. INPACT ON GOVERNMENT BUDGET&#13;
5.4   The project team has conducted an analysis of the net impact of the project on public&#13;
finances. Although the margins of error of such forecasts are necessarily quite wide, the net&#13;
impact appears very solidly positive, with the possible exception of a small negative impact in the&#13;
initial year when it might (pessimistically) reach US$167,000 after debt service. Incremental&#13;
budgetary costs are in fact very limited and consist essentially of: (a) small provisions for possible&#13;
complementary capital expenditures in the tounsm sector; (b) small provisions for possible&#13;
contributions to EPZ management costs in the first two years; and (c) the costs of collecting&#13;
incremental tax revenues. The main benefits are incremental tax revenues as detailed in Annex 6&#13;
plus direct and indirect tax revenues on local salaries (not taken into account in the economic&#13;
analysis). The positive impact should exceed US$1.0 million per year from the seventh year.&#13;
Although it is not conventional to calculate net present values for fiscal impact, the flow of costs&#13;
and benefits raises conceptually the same issues as in a financial analysis. In this case, it is&#13;
constructive to note that when discounted at 12%, the NPV of the net fiscal impact (after paying&#13;
IDA debt service) is USS4.82 million.&#13;
E. ECONOMIC ANALYSis&#13;
5.5   Economic analyses have been carried out for activities financed under the project for:&#13;
(a) the development of export-oriented manufacturing; (b) the development of the tourism sector,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(c) the provision of technical support to private enterprises; and (d) the financial sector. Since the&#13;
aim of the program financed by the project is to facilitate employment creation in the strategic&#13;
sub-component areas, its costs have been allocated to the other activities. Because the cost of the&#13;
component on technical support to enterprises is very small, and its benefits are difficult to&#13;
quantify, its cost has been allocated to the first two components. A detailed economic cost-&#13;
benefit analysis of the project is in Annex 6.&#13;
5.6   The economic analysis of activities aimed at encouraging foreign investment presents&#13;
some special problems. The approach used here is an innovative one which looks only at the&#13;
costs and benefits accruing to "Cape-Verde Incorporated", i.e., the people and Government of&#13;
Cape-Verde, on the grounds that the ownership of costs and benefits is particularly important&#13;
when foreign investment is involved, and that only costs and benefits that really accrue to the&#13;
target community are of relevance. The main costs taken into consideration in this methodology&#13;
are those directly borne by the project and the opportunity cost of labor employed in the new&#13;
enterprises. The main benefits are the wages received by that labor, and the fiscal revenues&#13;
accruing to Government. Per-capita GDP in Cape Verde is estimated at U$800, and the fall-back&#13;
occupation of most of the poor is very low-income subsistence agriculture. It is therefore&#13;
arguable that the true opportunity cost of labor is below U$800. However, to err on the side of&#13;
caution, it has been taken as US$1,000. The current wage of unskilled formal sector labor is&#13;
US$1,500, and average wages in new foreign-owned enterprises have been taken as US$1,600,&#13;
since they will also employ a proportion of skilled labor. Conventionally, indirect income-&#13;
generation effects are ignored in economic analyses, but in this type of project they play such an&#13;
important role that a very conservative estimate has been included, at a lower wage of US$1,280.&#13;
5.7   For the sub-component dealing with the development of export-oriented manufacturing&#13;
and information technology-based service industries, in addition to direct project costs, 67% of&#13;
the financial sector component costs, and 50%/a of the project management costs, the evaluation&#13;
also took into account US$1.82 million of EPZ start-up costs and factory-shell construction&#13;
undertaken on grant terms by the European Union and Luxembourg. The benefits have been&#13;
calculated on the basis of 2,700 new jobs created in the EPZ as a result of the project (a more&#13;
conservative estimate than the "base scenario" of 3,700 jobs predicted by Plant Location&#13;
International), each of which produces one low-paid indirect job outside the zone. Rents of the&#13;
factory shells (US$20 per square meter per year for pre-constructed factory-shells) become&#13;
payable on occupation, and direct taxes become payable only after the end of a ten-year tax&#13;
holiday (income taxes paid by local workers are transfers within Cape-Verde Inc. and are not&#13;
taken into account). The opportunity cost of capital has been taken at 12%. On the basis of these&#13;
assumptions, the component dealing with export oriented manufacturing has a positive NPV of&#13;
US$7.56 million, and an economic rate of return (ERR) of 31% over a project life of 15 years.&#13;
This positive impact derives predominantly from the benefits accruing from the directly-generated&#13;
employment.&#13;
5.8   Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to identify the effects of variances from the&#13;
base-case on the economic return of the private sector component. The biggest risk is a shortfall&#13;
in job-creation, and the switching value for this variable at which the NPV becomes zero is 1,430&#13;
jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.9   For the sub-component dealing with tourism development, the cost-benefit analysis is&#13;
based on an estimate of 750 new rooms and 30,000 extra tourists by 1999 (compared with&#13;
Government estimates of 4,300 and 43,000 respectively) with average stay rising from 6 to 8 days&#13;
per tourist. Expenditures per tourist-day are estimated at US$80 per person, and cost of&#13;
construction is US$50,000 per room, of which 300/o is for local labor. Direct job creation is of&#13;
one per room (conventional staffing rates often reach twice this level) with indirect job creation&#13;
being 50°/ of direct. Wages and opportunity costs are the sarne as in the manufauing sector.&#13;
On the basis of these assumptions, the tourism development component of the project has a&#13;
positive NPV of US$8.31 million at 12% discount rate, and has an ERR of 72%.&#13;
5. 10  Sensitivity analyses were also carried out for the tourism sub-component. Again, the main&#13;
risks are shortfalls in hotel construction and number of tourists. Assuming that these two&#13;
variables remain in the same ratio, the switching point at which NPV becomes zero is 23% of the&#13;
base level, i.e., 175 new rooms, and 7000 additional tourists.&#13;
5.11  For the project as a whole, including the components for which benefits were not&#13;
quantified, these figures become US$14.9 million and 37%, respectively.&#13;
F. RisKs&#13;
5.12 The very high rates of return on these components are indicative of the very high returns&#13;
resulting to the Cape-Verdean community from even a relatively small number of new modern-&#13;
sector jobs. They also reflect the critical importance of making the "package" of reforms,&#13;
incentives and promotion activities attractive enough to bring in the foreign investment that&#13;
constitutes the fundamental element of this project. The high returns are related to the high&#13;
inherent risks of spending money to attract foreign investment. If it succeeds, the returns are&#13;
large enough to generously reimburse the outlay. Two alternative ways of looking at these&#13;
favorable results are that, even if the project had only a 40°/. probability of success, it would still&#13;
be a good actuarial risk for the Government to take; altematively, it is clear that if, during project&#13;
inplementation, it appeared that the results were falling short of expectations, the potential&#13;
benefits from the project are large enough that the Government could improve the incentive&#13;
package and still come out with a very favorable return on its efforts.&#13;
5.13  Specific risks and risk-reduction strategies can be identified in a number of areas. There is&#13;
a risk that the Government that will take office after the eections in December 1995 might not&#13;
pursue the implementation of adequate macro-economic policies and liberalization reforms in the&#13;
areas of trade, pricing and finance. At present, this possibility looks very unlikely, as the outgoing&#13;
political formation has been returned to power. There is, however, strong pressure on the&#13;
incoming Government to maintain these reforms, as any weakening of the reform momentum&#13;
would jeopardize the on-going dialogue with the MF and the Bank. Further risks are related to&#13;
the capacity of the Government to implement this program. To help mitigate this potential&#13;
problem, the project includes a significant amount of expert advisory services focusing on sidlI&#13;
transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
5.14 The risk that, because of fierce competition between countries in the area, Cape Verde will&#13;
not succeed in attracting a sufficient number of foreign investors to have a meaningfW impact on&#13;
the development of its exports, has already been discussed (para. 3.7). To prevent this from&#13;
happening, the Government is offering significant incentives to potential investors by financing the&#13;
construction of several factory shells which they will be able to rent and by financing the training&#13;
of workers. Furthermore, no new factory shell will be built until there is a firm take-up agreement&#13;
with an investor. One significant advantage that Cape Verde offers in this respect is the political&#13;
stability which investors consider as a major factor in the location of their foreign investments.&#13;
Regarding tourism development, there is an analogous risk of a shortfall in the number of tourists.&#13;
To minimize this, the Government's strategy is to involve hotel chains linked to tour operators,&#13;
who thus have a vested interest in bringing tourists to Cape Verde.&#13;
5.15  There are also institutional risks regarding the BCA. The Government might be reluctant&#13;
to take the strong measures that are essential to reform this institution: downsizing the balance&#13;
sheet of the BCA, reducing its staff very significantly, giving the new management a great deal of&#13;
latitude and initiative to implement the reform measures, closing down uneconomic branches,&#13;
collecting bad loans. To prevent this risk from materializing, the Government has been asked to&#13;
express its commitment to reforming the BCA in the Letter of Private Sector Development&#13;
Policy. The Letter also includes future annual audit requirements. Furthermore, at the mid-term&#13;
review, all the above-mentioned aspects will be reviewed to ensure that they are being met.&#13;
VL AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   Following are the conditions that the Government has met prior to the negotiations of the&#13;
project:&#13;
(a)  Submission to IDA by the GOCV of a Letter of Private Sector Development Policy.&#13;
The Letter of Private Sector Development Policy confirms the Government's&#13;
intention to continue with the process of liberalization of the economy and to take all&#13;
appropriate legislative actions that will facilitate the operations of the private sector.&#13;
Copy of the signed Letter is attached as Annex 1.&#13;
(b)  Submission to IDA by the GOCV of a draft budget indicating that 50%/o of the&#13;
counterpart funds have been included in the budget for 1996;&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
LETTER OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
1.     Introduction&#13;
Cape Verde achieved a satisfactory rate of economic growth in the 1980s (about 6% per year), but&#13;
toward the end of the decade clear signs of economic problems appeared, particulary in the form of a substantial&#13;
decline in the GDP growth rate (from 7% in 1987 to about 2% in 1990), mainly due to a sizable reduction in&#13;
external assistanc for public investment. When Cape Verde achieved inependence in 1975, the Govemment&#13;
was assigned a key role in economic activites, with the pnvate sector playing only a marginal part. Many&#13;
activities, such as banking, insurance, certain aspects of imports and exports, nergy, public transportation in&#13;
urban areas, and air transportation were exclusively the domain of the public sector.&#13;
Govemment intervenbon was based on ecanonic protectionisi, and this was implllD ted thogh a&#13;
systen of import quotas and licenses. The outcome has been a lack of devekoret in the private sector, a&#13;
structural deficit in the trade balance (wih exports of goods and services covering imports by a rate of just over&#13;
20%), and inflation, which reached about 10% by 1990. Because of poor economic pfonrmance and the very&#13;
limited amount of job creabon in the public sector, unemployment steadily increased, reaching about 30% by&#13;
1990.&#13;
In addition to these intemal economic problens, the intrnational crisis produced external difficulties that&#13;
had a negatve impact on emigration and the flow of official development assistance. It was under these difficult&#13;
mcroeconomic circumsances that a new political systan was itroduced in Januazy 1991.&#13;
2.     The Government's Obiectives&#13;
The new Government adopted the following main objectives:&#13;
(i)    Reform of the financial sector, with a view to modenizing it and allowing instios to&#13;
specialize. The Government has also endeavored to itroduce compctitaon among the various financial&#13;
intermediaries.&#13;
(ii)    Development of new financial products, by establishing new nonbank institutions (e.g. regional&#13;
develpment companies, venture capital companies, investment compnMies, leasing comps, etc.), or banlcng&#13;
and insurance companies.&#13;
(iii)    Reform of the trade institutions (which had previously oprated by m ng imprt ceilings&#13;
and granting import lioenses), making them capable of gathirig processing and di fmati  infonnation on&#13;
both domestic and extemal trade to enterprises and consumers. This reform should also enable the ittutions to&#13;
play an active role in steering extenal trade toward more promusing markts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
(iv)    Privafizaton of most public enterprises, based on the principle that the Government should act&#13;
as an economic agent only when this is stategically necessaiy and the private sector is unable to respond in a&#13;
timely and efficient manner.&#13;
(v) Changes in the legal status and managment practices of those public enterprises dtat are not&#13;
privatized, so that thy can operate in the market on the same footimg as private enterprises (this involves&#13;
ammding their charters and undertkg the economic and financal rehabilitation of those that are in difficultes).&#13;
(vi)   Simplification of the tax system, maklng it more convenient for both the taxpayers and the&#13;
authorities and providing an effective means to counter fraud and tax evasion. This will also increase government&#13;
income, and simultaneously reduce the tax burden.&#13;
(vii)   Replacing the nmehanim  for direct inlervention in the ecowmy with indirect econanic&#13;
managment instruments. Previously, the Government determined monetay policy by setting interest rates and&#13;
credit limits, and price policy by setting prices for the main items in the housewife's food basket. It also imposed&#13;
incomes policies.&#13;
(viii) Introductioo of new macroeconomc management practices in which market forces are the basic&#13;
mechnism  for regulating the economy, with the Government using nacroeconmc tools and variables as a&#13;
means for achieving iternal and external equilibna as well as an appropriate distribution of incone. In fact, the&#13;
main objective will be to link economic stabilization prograns for correing cyclic changes to econonic growth&#13;
policies, so as to ensure sustainable economic development.&#13;
(ix)    The creation wihin government services of a new "cultre" that promotes and stimulates the&#13;
private sector, together with the establishment of institutions for promotng it.&#13;
3.     Macroeconomic and Sectoral Measures Adopted&#13;
A.    Reform of the Lgl Franework. From 1991, the following measures were adopted to adapt economic&#13;
legislation to the objectives listed above.&#13;
(i)    Removal of quotas and liberalization of trade.&#13;
(ii) Approval of a law on foreign investnents. This established incentives, but at the same time&#13;
redefined the "foreign" investor as anybody placing an investment in Cape Verde from an extenal source,&#13;
regardless of that person's natioality. As regards incentives, the investor receives considerable tax benefits, is&#13;
authorized to maintain accounts in convertible currencies, conduct all operaions from these accounts, and&#13;
transfer abroad both the capital originally invested and all profits derived therefriom. In addition, the decision-&#13;
making process has been greatly simplified, the cost of processing investment applications has been reduced, and&#13;
the principle of 'tacit approval" has been itroduced, according to which applications can be assumed to have&#13;
been autonmaically approved if the Government makes no response within a period of 30 days.&#13;
(iii)    Approval by the National Assembly of the law on export promoton, which gants tax and other&#13;
benefits to enterprises basically producing for the extenal market, regardless of the nature of the investnent in&#13;
question.&#13;

computerization, ac4oun  and econonuc, finaal and capital-sucture rehabilitation. The Govlmmat has&#13;
also established the Caixa de Cidito Rural (CCR) to mea te needs of m prises n die agicu    crafls&#13;
and fishenes sectors by prvxidg loans at subsidixz  rates.&#13;
(ui)    Refbnn of the isuranc sector. These activitie have been opened up to &amp;th private sector, amd,&#13;
in addition, the formr Instituto de Segurs de Prvidincia Social (INPS) has been urned into two new&#13;
intituions: the Compahia de Seguros Garantia,  RL (a publicly owned icorpoated body) and lhe Jnsltudo&#13;
Nacional de Preudencia Social. There is anodher pnvate insurnc ompany, MPAR. The Insliluto de Seguros&#13;

(m)    Reform of the tax system. Th tax reform program has icluded approval and adoptim of the&#13;
General Tax Code and approval of the law defining the bases for the snje tax rate applied to personal and&#13;
corporate incomes.&#13;
(iv)    Development of the finncl maket In order to improve the operation of ihe financial marke&#13;
(especially tlhrugh the introduction of new financial products), legislative mensum have been adopted in the&#13;
following areas: condition applicable to cash deposits in banks; lnding by banks and bank-like instit   of&#13;

D.    Privatiation of Public Enteises. In order to reduce substantially its role in the conoomy and piuote&#13;
the private sector, the Govemment approved a program for prnvatzng and roapiing public atrprises. After&#13;
approving the privttion law in 1992, irnplnenwtation was begun. As a remsult, in 1995, 14 out of 44 public&#13;
enterprises were already privatized and 6 dissolved, while II are being reorpniuze  The iunaining 15 are in&#13;
process of being privatizd. The Goverment is commited to maintaining its policy of public enterprise&#13;
privatzation.&#13;
In addiion, the public enterprse are being inorporated, so that this new status can be used to change&#13;
the relationship between them and the Governent&#13;
4.     Government Econonic Policies for DeveloDina the Private Sector&#13;
Govemnt economic policy over the coning years will be based on de folowing principles:&#13;
(1)         idation of its economic refonns;&#13;
(2)    deveopnt of the nwket economy and the private sector.&#13;
To fiunlw its cunt refbr , te Govenmen will pay pariicular ato to the folowig points:&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
(i)    Cotnuato of tax refom. Tbe first part of the mfonn applied to income tax. In May 1995&#13;
the National Assenbly approved the law mstuting a single inome tax rate; this law is already m effet In&#13;
coopeatim with the World Bank and the IMF, the Govermnent will undrtake the addibtnal measures neoessoy&#13;
for refoming the tax system, so that the tax rates applied to enterpiiss and individuals can be reduced by stages&#13;
up to the year 2000.&#13;
The second part of the refori will concem indirect taxes. The Govermet is comnmtted to compling&#13;
this second component of tax refonn by the end of the year 2000, by itroducing a value added tax. Refming&#13;
fte system will simplify the processes by which taxpayers fulfill thei oblgtons and the autories calate and&#13;
collec taxes, will reduce tax fiaud and evasion, and will provide for imroved &amp;stribution of the tax burden.&#13;
(ii)    Reform of the finial system. Finanial egislat  (including banking and  nn-banking&#13;
legislatio) will be revised, pllarly with regard to the status of BCV, to cilitate the partpat  or creai&#13;
of new institutions. BCV 's new status and the development of its organizafional and tehnical capacity will&#13;
enable it to fulfill more effiienty its function of implemting the G wvemmenes mcnxtay and excange pdoiy&#13;
and of supervising banking activities. To increse compti  in the banking sector, the Governent will take&#13;
steps to reduce BCA!s market share and the size of its balance sheet. The omposio  and role of BCA!s&#13;
exwcutive board will be strengthened according to criteria agreed with IDA. Any futre increase in BCA's capital&#13;
will take this objective into account. A ngorous debt recovery policy will be pursued with measu  being tak&#13;
to esure that curent bad debtors do not obtain new loans frim BCA or any other financial inu. Existig&#13;
lgislation requires all commercial banks to accept emiugnts' deposits; because of Cape Verde's need for foegn&#13;
exchange, and to prevent this policy fiom having a negative financial impact on the banks, the Govenment&#13;
undtakes to cmpsat the banks for the intest rate differetial wtin the limits of the law. Possible changes&#13;
in this systam will be studied with the assistance of the World Bank and the IMF.&#13;
in adto  interest rates on bank dqeosits and loans have already been liberalid, with the Govemmnit now&#13;
playing only an indirect role, by a4justing interest rates on Treaury notes and the disount rate. Banking&#13;
regulations will be revised so that the provisions goveming both the establishment of resere and the calculatin&#13;
of and accountng procedures for, bad debts to banks are brought into line with intemational standards.&#13;
As regards the publicly owned commei banks, CECV and BCA, the Govem_n undetkes to put&#13;
the entire capital of the former up for sale to private buyes by 1998, and the majority of the shares of BCA by&#13;
1999 at the latest. The foam and coxitions for these sales will be sbtdied in the liht of Cape Verde's laws, and&#13;
takig into accout te size and sructure of the banldng market and the need to promote comt. The&#13;
Governmnt also undtakoes to extd the same opeatig conditn to the CCR as apply to the other institu&#13;
in the financial systen, and the Govenment is committed to putig CCR's shares up for sale by Dooenber 1997&#13;
atthe latest.&#13;
As regards insmunce, the Govement will integrate ISCV, the monitng and supervory agency, into&#13;
BCV. In addition to the reforms already insuted, the GoveCmot plans to sell its shares in Garnlia in 1997&#13;
and promote the entry of other enterprises into the insurance sector. To allow for incresed compotio ansg&#13;
insurance cosmp  , by Decaeber 1996 at the latest the Govmmntt will dooontrol motor vhicle isuae&#13;
policy rates in line with the new regulations govering the nsuance sector, which should be in place not later&#13;
than July 1996.&#13;
in addion to the fuctoay ells in the Mindelo iduial zne financed by the Capacity Building&#13;
Project for Private Sector Promotion, the Governmt will cany out a study to identify ways of encouraging the&#13;

enprises wanting to sd up in Cape Verde.&#13;
(iii)    Reform of the educa    systn and development of vocaonal tng. Fron 1991 to 1994,&#13;
the first phase of the education systan refoms was unplnented. This applied to basic education. One of the&#13;
aimu was to provide sudents with technical skills, thus enabling thbn to meet the needs of teprises.&#13;
At the same time, and in light of the curut sitaton in the labor maket (characteized by a work force&#13;
with veiy limtd skdlls), special short courses to provide vocational taing for the youngest mebes of the&#13;
lbor force - especially those seekdng thir first jobs - will be established. The needs of enterprises will be tak&#13;
ito accomt when these courses are prepared and taught.&#13;
(iv)    Adminiusive reform. The aurent process of adminsai ve reform will be oonued, with the&#13;
basic objectives nt only of reducing the opaetng costs of govemment dqarpments, but also of acing their&#13;
efficincy. To this end, from 1996 to 2000,  ministave reform will wnphasize the need to   nalize&#13;
organizatioal suctLur  and develop work procedues and biformation flow. Parbtclar attention will also be&#13;
given to developing a business  ltue in govemment agenc   and to  mr deveopment, with a view to&#13;
iroducing inreased compeivmess, so as to improve the quaity of service.&#13;
i order to develop a market economy, the Govemmnent will apply the following policies:&#13;
(1)    Contied deeopment of iastructure. To this end, impl t     of the currt pOt,&#13;
airport and road nfiastuctur program will be continued.  However, from  1996 to 2000 infiasuctue&#13;
developmet will focus particlauly on the following:&#13;
(a)    Deveopment of the industrial mnes, particulary Mindelo and Pmaja The Govemmeut&#13;
will pursue its policy of making the entire country an Export Processing Zone.&#13;
(b)    Implamentation of a project designed to meet the water and energy neods of economic&#13;
opators. (This project is curudy being peparwd wih support from IDA and otier donors.) The Govnenunt&#13;
will firther study the potnial role of the private sector in water and energy, in order to impve effcey and&#13;
the quality of setvice.&#13;
(c) The development oftecomm aicos. To this end, the Govenmat intends to ensure the&#13;
insallatio ofa fiber-opic cabl link to prvide an itemationa comection to one ofthe iWans.&#13;
(ii)      p     nn of economic policies for: (i) integrating Cape Verde into the global oonmr,&#13;
(u) developing trade with Souteian Africa, South America, and the Far East, among otar ngms.&#13;
(iii)   Developmet of the practice of "social consultion', so as to provide for the best possible&#13;
dialogu bdween mnwagement and Labor, and between these parties and the Govenmment and nsure that all&#13;
parcipe in the devdlopnm   ofthe coutry.&#13;
(iv)    Establishsnat of the Cape Verde International Trade Fair, with private sau, opewag&#13;

(v)    Sutgteing of instibuons to support the private sector. The Governmet inteds to provide&#13;
such institutions with all the resources necessary for caffying out their function. The recet merger of INATUR&#13;
and PROMEX fits into this frnmor.&#13;
In addition, the Government has provided support for the establishment and insllation of chambers of&#13;
commer, which are private law instiuons. The Government undertakes to transfer to the chambers of&#13;
commerce some of the services curtly provided by its agencies. The chambers of commerce will play a full&#13;
role as the voice of the private sector. The Government will mnain an ongoing dialogue with them on all issues&#13;
relating to the development of the private sector, taking account of their views and opinions, through a process of&#13;
pennanent consulation.&#13;
(vi)   Updating of economic legislation and guarantees of the effectiveness of the judicial system in&#13;
judging economic offenses. Currently under way are the revision of the Commercial Code, the prepation of the&#13;
law regulatng compton, establishmnent of the taxation and customns court, and the assignment and appropriate&#13;
training ofjudges with exclusive responsibility for dealing with economic offenses.&#13;
(vii) Economic protection and security. The concept of protection and security that the Government&#13;
is adopting is based on the following three principles:&#13;
(a)    Protection and security resulting from the application of sound macroecononuc&#13;
policies, and particularly the implementation of short-term stabilization policies designed to bring about domestic&#13;
and external equilibria. The aim of these policies is to promote the confidence of economic agents in prices,&#13;
wages, the control of inflation, exchange and interest rates, and the economy's extema liqudity.&#13;
(b)    Protection and security as afforded by the law, in order to make Cape Verde a counry&#13;
in which both individuals and property are protected by right.&#13;
(c) Protection through institutions with responsibility for policing economic affirs,&#13;
identifying and eliminating economic offenses, particularly those of an international nature, such as arms and&#13;
dnig traffickdng.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
LAWS REGARDING EXPORT DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    The Law on Foreign Investment stipulates that foreign investors are guaranteed the right&#13;
to transfer abroad all profits derived from investments in Cape Verde. They are also authorized to&#13;
maintain accounts in convertible currencies in banking institutions in Cape Verde and to conduct&#13;
all operations from these accounts. In addition to the investment incentives, such as exoneration of&#13;
taxes on profits and customs duties that are applicable, dividends and profits distributed to foreign&#13;
investors derived from  investments are not taxable.  Also, foreign investments are offered&#13;
protection against expropriation and nationalization.&#13;
2.     The Law on Incentives to Exports, which deals with the export or re-export of goods and&#13;
services, stipulates that taxes on profits during the first five years of export or re-export activities,&#13;
shall benefit from a reduction equal to the proportion of foreign currency earned to total earnings&#13;
of the exporting entity. This period can be successively and consecutively prorogated by periods of&#13;
one year, up to the maximum of ten years.&#13;
3.     The Law on Export-Processing Zones grants special incentives to enterprises whose total&#13;
production of goods or services is either exported or sold to other enterprises whose production is&#13;
also entirely destined to export markets. These incentives include: (i) complete exemption from&#13;
taxes on profits during the first ten years of activities; (ii) exoneration of taxes on dividends and&#13;
profits distributed to the shareholders of the free zone enterprise during the first ten years of&#13;
operations; and (iii) complete exoneration of indirect taxes, including the stamp tax. After this&#13;
initial period of exoneration, the tax rate on profits and dividends of the free zone enterprises will&#13;
not exceed 15% during any fiscal year. Free-zone enterprises can also import and export without&#13;
obtaining licenses.&#13;
4.    In addition to the above legislative measures, the Government has taken action to&#13;
streamline and accelerate the approval process of foreign investments as well as the granting of the&#13;
status of export processing enterprises. It has also created the Commission for the Approval of&#13;
Foreign Investments and of Export Processing Enterprises (Resolution no. 43/93 of the Council of&#13;
Ministers of August 31, 1993), and has modified the labor code to provide greater flexibility&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
ECONOMIC SECTORS&#13;
1.    Manufacturing. The industrial sector's contribution of to the economy has gradually&#13;
increased from 3.7% of GDP in 1980, to 6.8% in 1985, and 8% in 1990. Statistics are not&#13;
currently available on the contribution of the private industrial sector to GDP. As of 1994, a total&#13;
of 101 enterprises, employing 3,300 persons, were categorized as industrial, of which 90% were&#13;
privately-owned, and 10% were joint ventures between the Government and private investors.&#13;
Although they are listed in 44 different fields of activity, the following six account for more than&#13;
half of the total number of enterprises: repair services (16 enterprises), carpentry (11), civil&#13;
construction (9), bakeries (8), graphic arts and metal products (6 each). Surprisingly, despite the&#13;
abundance of marine resources in Cape Verde, only four enterprises are involved in the processing&#13;
of seafood products,. Most industrial enterprises are small: only 17% employ more than 50&#13;
employees.&#13;
2.    Trade. The private sector plays a dominant role in trade which accounts for 20% of GDP&#13;
and represents one of the most developed sectors in Cape Verde. This is a legacy from the colonial&#13;
era when almost everything consumed on the islands was imported from Portugal by traders.&#13;
3.    Tourism. Cape Verde's climatic conditions, abundance of beautiful beaches, political&#13;
stability, and relative proximity by air to major European capitals are important assets for the&#13;
promotion of the tourism industry. Despite its potential, tourism does not play a significant role in&#13;
the economy and accounts for only about 2% of GDP. In 1988, the Government decided to give&#13;
priority to tourism development, but left most activities to private sector initiatives. The&#13;
Government has also agreed that the development of the sector would be synchronized with public&#13;
and private infrastructure investments in energy, sanitation and transport. In recent years, the&#13;
number of tourist facilities has increased significantly. In 1985, there were 8 hotels and 16 lodges&#13;
in the country; by 1993, the number of units had increased to 54, with a total of 1,100 rooms and&#13;
2,100 beds. In 1992, about 19,000 visitors (versus about 14,000 in 1986, resulting in a 36%&#13;
increase over four years) came to Cape Verde. It is estimated that about 1,300 persons are&#13;
employed in the sector. The occupancy rates of hotels in Sal and Praia range from 60 to 80%..&#13;
4.    A fifteen-year National Development Plan for Tourism, 1994-2009 (Piano Nacional de&#13;
Desenvolvimento do Turismo, PDNT) was prepared by the National Institute for Tourism,&#13;
INATUR (para. 2.17), with assistance from a Spanish consulting firm. The plan is divided into&#13;
three five-year implementation periods and calls for the creation of "special tourist zones", which&#13;
are areas on the various islands where hotel infrastructure and other tourist facilities would be&#13;
developed. The objectives for the first five-year period (1994-99), as expressed in the National&#13;
Development Plan for Tourism, are to: (i) have 62,000 visitors each year by 1999; (ii) have 4,500&#13;
hotel rooms of international standard or 9,100 beds; (iii) increase the average length of stay of&#13;
tourists from 5.9 to 8 days; (iv) create 11,000 new jobs in the hotel sector; (iv) attract foreign&#13;
exchange amounting to US$11.0 million during the last year of the plan; (v) promote domestic and&#13;
foreign investments in the sector; and (vi) increase inter-island tourism. Currently, 13 new hotel&#13;
projects, which would add about 1,500 beds to the country's logding capacity, have been identified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
ANNEX3&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
by private foreign investors with assistance from INATUR. Five of these projects have already&#13;
been approved or are under construction; two are being appraised and six are under discussion. If&#13;
the 13 projects actually materialize, Cape Verde would have, by the end of 1996, a total of 1800&#13;
hotel rooms (3,200 beds) of international standard..&#13;
5.     Fishing. Fisheries, which currently account for less than 3% of GDP, represent another&#13;
sector in which Cape Verde has some comparative advantage due to the large number of fish&#13;
species in the surrounding waters. The total annual sustainable yield of the sector is estimated at&#13;
about 42,000 tons, of which 7,300 tons are of deep water species, 11,000 tons are small pelagic&#13;
species, 22,000 tons are tuna and 1,800 tons are lobsters. Fishing in Cape Verde is predomiinantly&#13;
performed by artisans who account for about 85% of all of the fishermen in the country and&#13;
operate approximately 1,330 small, open boats, of which half are motorized.&#13;
6.     Fish Processing. About 6% of the sector's total annual catch is processed into canned&#13;
fish products and fish meal. Four small factories involved in fish processing operate at a very low&#13;
capacity of only 10% and are very dependent on the tuna run, which takes place during the second&#13;
half of the year. Facilities related to the fishing industry include fishing wharves 340 meters long&#13;
in Sao Vicente as well as cold storage units of 25,450 cubic meters, deep freezers with a capacity&#13;
of 30 tons daily, a ship repair facility and a maritime training school. On the island of Sal, there&#13;
are fishing wharves, a cold storage plant of 1,660 cubic meters, a deep freezer with a processing&#13;
capacity of 15 tons per day, as well as a lobster hatchery.&#13;

CAPACITY BUILDING FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMTION&#13;
INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
1.    Local Insuions  Two insfitutions are curraty responsible for providing support to&#13;
develop the pnvate sector PROMEX and LADE. Most of hese insttuas have only recently&#13;
started operations. To ensure adequate cooperation among then, while avoidig duplicatio, the&#13;
Goverment intends to create an investnent committee, which will include these insbtitons, to&#13;
coordinate all investment policies designed to help the private sectr. It is expocted that the&#13;
committee will be operational by mid-1996.&#13;
2.    PROMEX was created in 1990 by the Government, with assistance fmm the US Agency&#13;
for Intemational Development (USAID), to assist in export promotion and foreign investnent&#13;
development. USAID has funded part of PROMEX's operating expenses, but is withdrawing frmm&#13;
Cape Verde at the end of 1995. In 1992, the Govemnment revised PROMEX's sttutes to give the&#13;
agency sufficient autonomy or decision making power to enable it to fulfill its fiucbons efectively,&#13;
and PROMEX commenced operations as a one-stop-shop for foreign investors.&#13;
3.     Since 1992, PROMEX has played a significant role in the preparation of various laws&#13;
necessary to facilitate the establishment of foreign investments in Cape Verde. It is actively&#13;
seeking to attract foreign investments in the country and, in spite of existing cosaints, it has&#13;
succeded in attracting five foreign enterprises which have collectively invested US$8.5 million in&#13;
light manuficturing. As a result, the creation of about 800 jobs is expected. Further investments&#13;
are currently being considered by several enterpises from Hong Kong and Porhtgal. There is&#13;
particular interest in garment manufacturing, an area in which Cape Verde has a signifcant&#13;
comparative advantage due to its relatively low labor costs and its prefinal access to markets of&#13;
the European Union, the United States and te ECOWAS countries.&#13;
4.    INATUR was created in February 1993 (Decreto No. 1/93) to promote the developmet of&#13;
the tourism sector. Specifically, INATUR was responsible for helping the Govemment to defi&#13;
the national policy for tourism development, preparing plans and programs for the development of&#13;
tourism, and ensuring their implementation. However, due to similarities in the mandates given to&#13;
PROMEX and INATUR, the Government merged, in October, INATUR into PROMEX to achieve&#13;
economies of scale and better utiization of the limited human and financial resources.&#13;
5.    LADE was created at the beginning of 1992 with the asnce of the Afncan&#13;
Development Bank for the purpose of developing entrepreneurial capabilities and improving the&#13;
utilization of the instlled productive capacity. LADE, which started operating in October 1993, is&#13;
expected mainly to provide assistance to smal- and medium-size enterprises in technical, financiatl&#13;
commercial, or organizational areas to improve their productivity and their ability to compte in&#13;
domestic and external markets. Untl now, LXDE has provided assistance to a very limited&#13;
number of enterprises. This is due, in part, to its operating procedures which require the approval&#13;
of its assistance contracts by the Minister of Economic Coordination himself. Undertandably,&#13;
private entrepreneurs are reluctant to provide information on their activities to LADE as they know&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
that such information will be communicated to high-level Government officials. IADE is therefore&#13;
not effectively playing its mandated role and needs a major restructuring program which would&#13;
involve, among other things, (a) a management change; (b) a redefinition of its relationship with the&#13;
Government; and (c) a modification of its operating procedures.&#13;
6.    Trade Associations.  There are two trade associations: the Associa,cao Comercial&#13;
Sotavento, which includes commercial enterprises located in the first group of islands of Santiago,&#13;
Fogo, Brava and Maio; the Associagao Comercial Barlavento, which includes commercial&#13;
enterprises in the second group of islands of Sao Vicente, Santo Antao, San Nicolau, Sal and&#13;
Boavista; the majority of its members are concentrated on the Sao Vicente island&#13;

CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
SELECTED FINANCIAL SECTOR TOPICS&#13;
A. Supervision And Regulation Of Financial Institutions&#13;
Bankdng Supervision&#13;
1.    Organization. The supervision of banks is the responsibility of Cape Verde's central bank, the&#13;
Banco de Cabo Verde. A banking supervision departnent was established in September, 1993 when the&#13;
Banco de Cabo Verde transferred its commercial banking activities to the newly-created Banco Comerctal&#13;
do Atlantico. The supervisory staff comprises the director of the department, two supervisors, and one&#13;
trainee. Since its creation, the department has been receiving assistance from the Banco de Portugal. As a&#13;
result, the department is generally well organized and managed, with most important supervisory policies,&#13;
procedures, and regulations in place. However, significant gaps in regulation do exist. These weaknesses&#13;
are discussed below in paragraph 9.&#13;
2.    The banking supervision department has embraced a supervisory approach which encompasses&#13;
both on-site examination and off-site surveillance. This is entirely appropriate and suitable for the needs of&#13;
Cape Verde.&#13;
3.    On-site Examination. Since its inception, the department has examined the Caixa Economica&#13;
twice. One examination was a comprehensive examination which focused on all significant areas of risk, as&#13;
well as the CAMEL (Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, and Liquidity)&#13;
components. The second examination was targeted to foreign exchange activities. Thus far, however, the&#13;
Banco Comercial do Atlantico has not been examnined. A planned examination was postponed in view of&#13;
the special diagnostic audit which was carried out for the 1994 accounts. Written examination procedures&#13;
are tailored for each examination depending on its planned scope. The report of examination is primarily in&#13;
narrative form and examiners are expected to render specific conclusions on all major areas of examination&#13;
miterest. Reports are discussed with the bank's administrative council. This discussion should be further&#13;
extended to the supervisory board. It is intended that comprehensive general examinations of each bank are&#13;
carried out once per year.&#13;
4.    The examination process is developing in an appropriate manner. However, additional experience,&#13;
particularly in assessing asset quality and its implications for a bank's financial health, is noeded.&#13;
Experienced examiners in some industrialized countries will have analyzed thousands upon thousands of&#13;
credits. There is no easy way to gain such experience except by doing it. Continued training in on-site&#13;
examination and credit analysis provided by the Banco de Portugal and financed under this project wil&#13;
support the further development of the on-site examination process.&#13;
5.    The examination process can provide additional benefits by its use as a catalyst in bringing about&#13;
changes in the way banks are managed. In particular, examiners should stress the need for banks to obtain&#13;
current and satisfactory financial information on their borrowers from the inception of a loan to its ultimate&#13;
repayment. There is no substitute for such information in evaluating the quality of credit. Admittedly, the&#13;
quality of this information may be poor in the short-term. However, over time, as banks realize its use and&#13;
educate their borrowers, the quality of information should improve. Obviously, the nature of the financial&#13;
infonnation required of commercial enterprises wil differ from that of individuals. Other areas where the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
examination process can provide the stimulus for change are strategic planning, loan review, and the&#13;
adoption of written policies.&#13;
6.     Off-site Surveillance. Periodic prudential reports submitted to the Banco de Cabo Verde form the&#13;
basis of the department's off-site surveillance function. Reports are required in the following areas: Risk-&#13;
based capital adequacy, Components of capital, limits on fixed assets, Liquidity, Limits on large exposures,&#13;
Equity participations, Minimum provisions, Investment in Government Securities, Registration of banks,&#13;
and Registration of bank officials.&#13;
7.     These reports provide a starting point for an effective off-site surveillance function. However, the&#13;
off-site reporting system can be improved through the development of a more detailed analytical base which&#13;
permits evaluation of banks using ratio and trend analysis. Prudential reports should be compiled in a&#13;
standard analytical format where such ratios and trends are calculated. When justified by the number of&#13;
banks, peer groups should also be introduced for comparison. The off-site analysis should provide an&#13;
interim means of evaluating or monitoring a bank's efficiency and profitability, funding strategies, exposure&#13;
to interest rate and foreign exchange position risks, past due loans, growth trends and capital between on-&#13;
site examinations. However, it will not substitute for a thorough on-site analysis of asset quality, internal&#13;
controls, and management. The automated off-site system should also permit ad-hoc reports and queries, as&#13;
well as the downloading of information into spreadsheets for modeling and sensitivity analysis. The project&#13;
will support the financing of appropriate software to drive an automated off-site surveillance system.&#13;
8.     Because of serious operational difficulties at the Banco Comercial do Atlantico, it has failed to&#13;
submit the required prudential reports. Thus, in practice, the supervision department's off-site monitoring&#13;
function has been frustrated.&#13;
Prudential Regulations and the Legal Framework for Financial Institutions&#13;
9.     Prudential Regulations. Laws or prudential regulations have been promulgated in the Official&#13;
Bulletin of Cabo Verde addressing the following topics: limits on concentrations of credit risk, risk-based&#13;
capital adequacy, minimum loan loss provisions, limits on equity participations, limits on investment in&#13;
fixed assets, internal controls, licensing, loans to insiders and connected parties, enforcement powers, and&#13;
minimum provisions. As noted above, there are, however, gaps in the existing regulations which require&#13;
action on the part of the Banco de Cabo Verde. These weaknesses are as follows:&#13;
Classification of Assets, Provisioning, and Treatment of Interest on Non-Performing&#13;
Assets. An existing regulation classifies loans and requires minimum provisions based only on historic&#13;
performnance, i.e., past due status. Since one reason for grading the quality of credit is to identify problems&#13;
at an early stage when they can still be corrected, the classification criteria should focus not only on historic&#13;
performance but also, and very importantly, on prospective performance. An assessment should be made of&#13;
a borrower's ability to repay the bank through primary sources of repayment, i.e., cash flow for term debt,&#13;
and the business asset conversion cycle for working capital credit. This assessment can only be made&#13;
through current and satisfactory financial information obtained from the borrower through the life of a&#13;
loan. The current regulation serves to understate the problems existing within the loan portfolio since many&#13;
problem assets will not immediately show up as past due. In addition, provisioning rates are liberal when&#13;
compared to past due status. For instance, a loan up to three months past due requires only a 1% provision.&#13;
By the time a loan is approaching three months past due, it is likely that all liquid assets have already been&#13;
dissipated. Thus, the risk of loss must be higher than only 1%. Further, specific rules should be established&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
regarding the suspension or non-accrual of interest on non-performing assets and the accounting treatment&#13;
to be accorded such interest, to included reversal of previously accrued but uncolected interest taken into&#13;
income. Rules should also address capitalization or refinancing of interest which is due and uncolected.&#13;
The regulation should also require write-off of old outstanding items and classification of other assets such&#13;
as foreclosed real estate.&#13;
Capital Adequacy. There is an existing regulation requiring a minimum capital adequacy&#13;
ratio using a risk-weighted assets formula. However, the risk-weights assigned to certain asset categories&#13;
are questionable given the economic environment in which the banks are operating. Of these, the weight of&#13;
50% assigned to housing loans is the most questionable. Although the Basle guideline allows national&#13;
discretion and permits a 50% weight for residential mortgage loans, the weighting was the subject of much&#13;
dispute within the Committee. In Cape Verde, since real estate is the most widely used collateral, the 50%&#13;
weight tends to dilute the mandatory minimum capital requirement. Collateral, in most cases, does not&#13;
repay loans. If the bank had to foreclose, there would be the expense and time of foreclosure, costs to&#13;
maintain or improve the property before it could be sold, the costs of security guards, opportunity costs as&#13;
funds are tied up in a non-earning asset which, most likely, is being funded by an interest-bearing liability,&#13;
etc. Thus, real estate is not the panacea to sound assessment of a borrower's primary sources of repayment.&#13;
Many countries have experienced collapses in their residential property markets. Further, the legal system&#13;
in Cape Verde does not yet permit timely foreclosure or repossession of collateral. There are strong&#13;
arguments, therefore, for saying that loans secured by real estate are a normal banking risk--a risk which&#13;
should require a standard risk-weight of 100%.&#13;
Uncovered Foreign Exchange Positions. A regulation should establish the outside&#13;
constraints on risk-taking by banks in foreign exchange activities. These constraints should limit the net&#13;
open position in any single currency and the aggregate net open position in all currencies, as a percent of&#13;
the bank's unimpaired capital and reserves. In addition, the regulation should require that all positions in&#13;
foreign currency are revalued at least monthly and all losses, realized or unrealized, resulting from the&#13;
revaluation are immediately recognized as an expense of the bank and all gains, realized or unrealized,&#13;
resulting from the revaluation are immediately recognized as income to the bank. The regulation should&#13;
also require banks to formulate written policies governing foreign exchange activities. These policies should&#13;
include a formal ratification of internal limits, within the tolerances established by the regulation, governing&#13;
overnight open positions by currency and for all currencies combined. Where the volume of activities&#13;
warrants, intraday limits should also be established. Limits should also be established for counterparty&#13;
credit, settlement, and country risks. Country limits should be established for total exposures to all&#13;
counterparties in each country. Limits should also be established for foreign currency interest rate and&#13;
liquidity risks as part of overall asset and liability management.&#13;
Resolution of Failed Banks. The Banco de Cabo Verde should have powers to close an&#13;
institution when it is technically insolvent or approaching technical insolvency, i.e., the value of the bank's&#13;
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities. When a bank is permitted to operate while insolvent, its&#13;
losses are most likely to grow rapidly in a perverse, but unsustainable, spiral of interest rate increases on&#13;
deposits and ratcheting up of the amount of bad loans in the portfolio -- culminating in the eventual&#13;
illiquidity of the bank and potential govermnent liability to depositors. The resolution of failed banks is a&#13;
difficult and complex issue in all countries. It is important, then, that the Banco de Cabo Verde is granted a&#13;
broad array of discretionary powers to deal with such situations. The experience of most countries suggests&#13;
that ad-hoc approaches do not work when attempting to resolve failed bank situations. If a failed bank is to&#13;
be restructured, certain key principles apply: a) the bank's management is removed; b) the shareholders,&#13;
who have lost their investment, are wiped out by the losses sustained; c) the bad assets are carved out of the&#13;
balance sheet, preferably with government bonds; and d) the pricing of the bonds used in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54                                  ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
the financial restructuring must ensure that the bank returns to profitable operations. The legal framework&#13;
should permit the central bank to undertake all these actions, i.e., to declare a bank insolvent and closed, to&#13;
remove management, to wipe out the shareholders of a failed bank, and to carve out bad assets, in a timely&#13;
manner based on the factual conditions existing. When a political decision is involved, action often is&#13;
delayed, causing losses to mount. In a liquidation situation, in order to maintain the stability of the banking&#13;
system and avoid a banking panic, the Banco de Cabo Verde may find it necessary to finance the payoff of&#13;
depositors or assumption of deposits by another institution. The usual rule in deciding whether to&#13;
restructure or liquidate and the methodology to be used is that the least cost alternative should be used,&#13;
provided that stability in the banking system is maintained. Given the complexity of these issues,&#13;
particularly during times of financial system distress, the legal framework should be strengthened to&#13;
provide for such possibilities in advance of the actual need. Therefore, appropriate legislative changes&#13;
should be made granting these powers to the Banco de Cabo Verde.&#13;
10.   Debt Recovery. In addition to strengthening the prudential environment, there is a need for&#13;
additional legislation in the area of debt recovery. Currently, banks have difficulty in collecting on&#13;
delinquent debts because the court system is januned with civil and criminal cases. A case may not be taken&#13;
up by the court for several years. This delay contributes to a poor repayment ethic as even those capable of&#13;
paying see no reason not to be slow in their paymnents. Once a case is heard by the court, however, the bank&#13;
is generally successful in obtaining a favorable decision. Clearly, there is a need to bypass the normal court&#13;
system with a special court, or a commercial tribunal, that deals only with issues of commercial law. This&#13;
would expedite the hearing of simple foreclosure actions so that banks would be able to instill discipline in&#13;
the repayment practices of their borrowers. For assets other than real property, laws should permit the bank&#13;
to physically repossess the asset without resorting to the court system. This would benefit the bank by&#13;
allowing it to acquire the asset before its value dissipates further, thus reducing the amount of loss that may&#13;
be incurred. If a debtor believes he has been wronged, it should be up to him to bring suit for redress. The&#13;
project will seek additional legislation to implement these recommendations.&#13;
Centralized Credit Risk Information System&#13;
11.   A law has been approved, but not yet promulgated, authorizing the creation of a centralized credit&#13;
risk information system. In addition to its supervisory duties, the department of bank supervision is&#13;
responsible for the development and maintenance of this system. The proposed system will collect&#13;
information on borrowers from all banks. Ideally, the bank supervision department hopes to collect this&#13;
infornation on diskette so that it can be quickly loaded on computer and consolidated with information&#13;
collected from other banks. Each borrower will have a unique identification number--either his national&#13;
identity card number for individuals, or a tax identification number for companies. The type of information&#13;
to be collected has not yet been decided, but will include basic information such as the name of the&#13;
borrower, the amount outstanding, the maturity date of the loan, the current status of payments, etc. Banks&#13;
will be the only authorized users of the system. When information is reported to a bank, it will be in&#13;
aggregate form, i.e., the borrower's loans will not be attributed to a specific institution. Past due&#13;
information on a borrower will also be reported on a global basis. The project will support the development&#13;
of this systemn.&#13;
Insurance Supervision&#13;
12.   Supervision of insurance institutions is the responsibility of the Instituto de Seguros de Cabo&#13;
Verde. The Institute has only six employees including the Commissioner, two technical assistants, and three&#13;
clerical personnel. Thus far, supervisory activities have been limited to off-site monitoring through&#13;
prudential returns filed by the insurance companies. On-site examinations have not yet taken place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
PageS of 14&#13;
Assistance is being provided from Portuguese sources. Given the smaU size of the Institute, it lacks&#13;
authority. Thus, the project will propose that the function be merged as a separate division with the&#13;
department of banking supervision in the Banco de Cabo Verde. The professional staff in both banking&#13;
supervision and insurance supervision should be cross-trained to create a pool of trained personnel&#13;
available to carry out supervisory activities in either discipline. The proposed merger should result in&#13;
synergies such as the elimination of overheads and increased prominence of the supervisory function.&#13;
Additional training for insurance supervision will be provided under the project.&#13;
13.   Insurance regulations currently impose a subsidized, mandatory motor vehicle premium rate and a&#13;
limit on suitable investment alternatives. They also need clarification with respect to reinsurance guidelines.&#13;
Therefore, the project will support a review of insurance regulations, to include technical and mathematical&#13;
reserve requirements, investment policies and constraints, reinsurance guidelines, and mandatory premium&#13;
rates, so that the latter reflects underlying risk.&#13;
B. Analysis of Caixa Economica and Banco Comercial Do Atlantico&#13;
I. Financial Appraisal Of Caixa Economica Dc Cabo Verde&#13;
14.   Overall Conclusion. The overall financial condition and future prospects of Caixa Economica de&#13;
Cabo Verde are good. The bank is well-managed, very well-capitalized, has a good reputation, and should&#13;
expect strong earnings in 1995. Given the problems of its chief competitor, the bank has an opportunity to&#13;
expand market share and become a more significant player in the market. The overall outlook is&#13;
exceptionally bright.&#13;
15.   Background. The Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde was established as a postal savings bank in&#13;
1928. It received its banking license in September 1993. Currently, it operates two banking offices, the&#13;
head office in Praia and a branch in Mindelo, as well as 15 postal agencies. It has 56 employees. The bank&#13;
is the second largest in Cape Verde with a 10% market share of assets, 20% share of net loans, and 8%&#13;
share of deposits. The bank is wholly-owned by the Government (through the Ministry of Economic&#13;
Coordination and three state-owned enterprises). However, the Government plans to sell to the public all&#13;
shares of Caixa Economica by 1997.&#13;
16.   Financial statements for 1994 were audited. In the opinion of the auditors, the financial statements&#13;
represent a true and fair portrayal of the bank's position as of December 31, 1994. However, the auditors&#13;
expressed one caveat. Because of the large number of small loans and the time constraints under which they&#13;
were working, they could not examine enough credits to make an adequate test of the provision for loan&#13;
losses.&#13;
17.   Management. The management team is competent, well-organized, and in-tune with market&#13;
developments. The bank's president joined the bank in 1991. Although not a banker by training or prior&#13;
experience, she has adapted remarkably well by using common sense and good business judgment. She&#13;
clearly provides vision and leadership, and appears to be an effective delegator and innovator. The staff is&#13;
well-integrated into the operations of the bank and supporting managers are capable.&#13;
18.   Asset Quality. Asset quality is fair. At year-end, past due loans of more than one month&#13;
aggregated approximately 22% of outstanding loans and 74% of the bank's capital and loan loss reserves.&#13;
By June 30, 1995, the volume of past due loans had declined to 12%., which shows a significant&#13;
improvement. Management indicates that individual borrowers tend to delay payments over the holiday&#13;
season at Christmas, thus explaining somewhat the higher past due ratio. Nonetheless, past due amounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
above 10%/., even in a developing country environment, are a cause of concem and require even greater&#13;
attention to collection activities. Two-thirds of the past due amounts are less than six months overdue. To&#13;
intensify collection activities, management has employed local attomeys on a commission basis. Several&#13;
cases have DOW been brought to court. Management also has initiated an active cal program to identify&#13;
loan problems at an early stage, as wel as to identify market opportunities. Since year-end, capital has&#13;
been augmented by an additional 30 million escudos, thus reducing the volume of past due loans to about&#13;
52% of the bank's gross capital funds. When the additional 48 million escudos in capital is issued, this&#13;
percentage will decline further to about 46%.&#13;
19.   Since receiving its banking license, Caixa Economica has been diversifying from its traditional&#13;
housing and consumer credits to short-termn commercial finance and longer-term projects. As of 12/31/94,&#13;
the portfolio mix was as follows: housing loans - 42%/o, consumer loans - 25%, commercial loans - 21%,&#13;
and aUl others - 12%. The past due amounts are mostly in the housing and consumer loan categories. To&#13;
better control past dues, repayment of housing loans is being set up on a payroll deduction plan with the&#13;
agreement of the borrower's employer whenever possible.&#13;
20.   Loans to individuals for housing and consumer credit, unlike commercial loans, are generally&#13;
evaluated on a performance basis. Thus, even though the auditors did not have the opportunity to review a&#13;
large enough portion of the small loans to comfortably opine on the adequacy of the loan loss provisions,&#13;
the likelihood is that, in this instance, the past dues portray a reasonable picture of portfolio quality. With&#13;
that assumption, the loan loss reserve of nearly 6% of net loans is probably realistic. Nevertheless,&#13;
continued vigilance is necessary and any deterioration in portfolio quality should be iunmediately met with&#13;
additional provisions.&#13;
21.   As noted above, commercial lending activities are relatively new. The bank has established lending&#13;
authorities at its branch and within its main office, as weUl as a loan committee of seven persons to review&#13;
larger loan requests. Despite a period of rapid growth in lending early this year, loan growth has recently&#13;
slowed due to the credit ceilings imposed under the Government's program with the IMF to constrain&#13;
monetary expansion. However, many projects remain in the pipeline. For 1994, net loans increased by 19%&#13;
over the prior year end.&#13;
22.   The bank is involved with several bilateral donors, including Caisse Francaise de Developpment&#13;
and the US Agency for International Development, and NGOs in microenterprise on-lending schemes. The&#13;
latter have provided resources of FF 5 millien and US$3 million, respectively. Monies are used for small&#13;
and medium and micro enterprise projects.&#13;
23.   Earnings. Earnings for 1994 were fair. The bank suffered a net loss of 4 million escudos, or a&#13;
negative return on assets of .22%. However, the loss was largely due to two factors. The first was the non-&#13;
recurring expenses attributed to preparatory work for the automation of the bank's activities. This is bome&#13;
out by the high non-interest expense of 4.49% of average assets. The second factor is that the bank had&#13;
little investment alternatives in 1994 since treasury bills had not yet been introduced and the bank had little&#13;
choice but to let funds remain idle. The lack of investment alternatives is reflected in the relatively low&#13;
earning assets ratio. Average earning assets were only 65% of average assets. The amount of cash and due&#13;
from banks was nearly 30% of total assets. With the introduction of treasury bills, there is now another&#13;
investment alternative. The bank has taken advantage of this by purchasing approximately 600 mnillion&#13;
escudos in T-bills since their introduction at a tax-equivalent yield of about 8.9%.&#13;
24.   Thus, both factors that led to the loss in 1994 have been addressed. Otherwise, the bank's income&#13;
and expense structure looks sound. The bank's interest income as a percent of average assets was 7.58%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
compared to interest expense of 3.74% of average assets. This resulted in net interest earnings of 3.65%.&#13;
The yield on average earning assets was 11.69%, the cost of interest bearing liabilities as a percent of&#13;
average eaming assets was 6.07%/o-leading to a healthy net interest margin og 5.62%. The yield on loans&#13;
was 12.33%. While the cost of time deposits was relatively high at 9.38%, the bank enjoyed a favorable&#13;
mix of deposits with demand and low-cost savings accounts representing two-thirds of the deposit base.&#13;
Management is discouraging new deposits unless it can employ them profitably. Earnings, therefore, should&#13;
be healthy for 1995 barring unforeseen events.&#13;
25.   Capital Adequacy. The bank is very well-capitalized. At year end, book capital represented 12.6%&#13;
of end-of-period assets. On a risk-weighted basis, capital was 17% of risk-weighted assets. An additional&#13;
48 million escudos in capital is to be sold pending the finalization of the 1994 audit. The stock issue is fully&#13;
subscribed. Given the strong eamings performance from core activities expected in 1995, there is no reason&#13;
to believe that capital will not remain adequate as a cushion against unforeseen losses.&#13;
26.   Liquidity, Asset and Liability Management. Liquidity, asset and liability management practices&#13;
are satisfactory. For the most part, the bank uses traditional asset management techniques to meet its&#13;
liquidity needs. Funding is primarily provided through low cost deposits. With the introduction of short-&#13;
term treasury bills, management is now able to invest in a secondary source of liquidity. Management&#13;
closely monitors deposit costs and alternatives for investment. High cost sources of funds, such as emigrant&#13;
deposits, are discouraged. The bank has adequate availability of funds to meet its loan demand but is&#13;
constrained by the credit ceilings imposed on it.&#13;
27.   Interal Control and Internal Audit Activities. Intenal controls are satisfactory. Although the&#13;
auditors noted several internal control weaknesses, none was judged as significant. Overall, the bank is&#13;
well-organized, and administrative and accounting controls appear to be in order.&#13;
28.   The bank does not yet have an internal auditor. However, there are plans to create an intemal&#13;
auditor position in the near tern. The person designated by management to fill this position is currently the&#13;
accounting manager and is very capable. He will assume his new duties once a suitable replacement can be&#13;
found for him in the accounting area. His selection demonstrates management's strong commnitment to&#13;
establishing the internal audit function as an important bank activity.&#13;
29.   Future Prospects. Future prospects for Caixa Economica are good. The bank is well-managed,&#13;
adequately capitalized, and should enjoy strong earnings during 1995. With the problems at the Banco&#13;
Comercial do Atlantico, there exists an opportunity to expand market share and play an important role&#13;
within the Cape Verde economy. Management plans to further market its services through post offices, to&#13;
further develop its commercial lending activities, to market foreign exchange services to selected clients, to&#13;
strengthen its credit administration, and to augment its range of services, with products such as ATMs and&#13;
secondary market activities in T-bills. At the same time, management plans to maintain its niche in the&#13;
housing area.&#13;
30.   Technical Assistance Needs. The bank can use assistance in four areas: strategic and business&#13;
planning; the implementation of cost accounting, profit centers, and transfer pricing; new product&#13;
development; and the establishmnent of the internal audit function. In addition to staff training, the project&#13;
will provide assistance in these areas.&#13;

II. Fmancial Appraisal of the BCA And Recommended Action Plan For Its Restructuring&#13;
(a) Financial Analysis of the BCA&#13;
31.   Overall Conclusion. The overall financial condition and future prospects of the Banco Comercial&#13;
do Atlantico are poor. The bank is in disarray, poorly managed, and in serious financial distress. Its&#13;
operations reflect significant weaknesses in internal accounting and administrative controls, non-&#13;
compliance with internal policies and procedures, violations of banking regulations, and unsafe and&#13;
unsound lending practices. The bank's future viability can only be assured through strong actions designed&#13;
to change its banking culture and management practices, through the introduction of a professional&#13;
management, the establishment and adherence to tough new banking policies and procedures, automation of&#13;
management information systems, a willingness to dispense with the services of individuals who cannot&#13;
perform satisfactorily and to discontinue unprofitable operations, and a concerted effort to remake the&#13;
institution from the ground up. An action plan to restore the bank to financial, operational, and managerial&#13;
health is presented below.&#13;
32.   Background. The Banco Comercial do Atlantico was created in September 1993 when it assumed&#13;
the commercial banking operations of the central bank, the Banco de Cabo Verde. The bank operates 12&#13;
branches and has 366 employees. As of December 31, 1994, the bank had a 90% market share of assets,&#13;
80% share of loans, and 92% share of deposits, making it the predominant banking institution in Cape&#13;
Verde. The bank is Government-owned.&#13;
33.   Financial statements for 1994 were provisionally audited. However, the auditors were unable to&#13;
express an opinion on the financial statements due to the following limitations: a) financial statements were&#13;
not prepared for year-end 1993, thus comparative financial statements are not available and there is a lack&#13;
of continuity; b) the financial results have not yet been approved and finalized - all numbers are still&#13;
provisional; c) there are significant deficiencies in accounting and internal controls including the absence of&#13;
reconciliations, lack of supporting documentation, an inability to check accounts, and the lack of an audit&#13;
trail. Thus, the accuracy and reliability of information cannot be ascertained; and d) information on&#13;
borrowers was not available to determine the adequacy of loan loss provisions. The auditors state that they&#13;
cannot assure that all problems have been identified because of the bank's general state of disarray.&#13;
34.   Management. With the exception of the bank's new president, management is unsatisfactory.&#13;
Admittedly, many of the bank's problems are inherited from the Banco de Cabo Verde and some problems&#13;
are due to the inadequacies of the management information system. However, this does not excuse the many&#13;
weaknesses within the control of management such as the need to reconcile accounts, maintain adequate&#13;
intemal accounting and administrative controls, pursue active collection activities on delinquent borrowers,&#13;
grant and administer loans on a sound basis, adhere to established policies, etc. While some members of the&#13;
management team might be capable in a nonnal banking environment, they have been unable to exercise the&#13;
tough decision-making and leadership called for in a distress situation. Clearly, a turnaround managment&#13;
is required.&#13;
35.   Notwithstanding the foregoing comments, the bank's new president appears capable of leading the&#13;
bank back to health if given adequate support. Since joining the bank in February 1995, he has correcdy&#13;
diagnosed the bank's many problems and begun to take appropriate steps to tum the bank around. He has&#13;
personally taken responsibility for renegotiating several large delinquent loans and he recently negotiated a&#13;
contract to upgrade the bank's data processing facilities and inplement a new management information&#13;
system. However, he needs help in the form of a strong supporting management team. To this end, the&#13;
project will support the employment of capable supporting managers experienced in turnaround situations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                  ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
36.    Adding to the bank's management problems, is an organizational structure in which there is an&#13;
excessive number of departments, where some activities are duplicated and some departments lack clear&#13;
definition. On the other hand, the bank lacks a marketing function and formalized planning (strategic plan,&#13;
operations plan, capital plan, etc.). Management's time horizon is short-term, day-to-day, rather than&#13;
strategic. Management reacts rather than leads. Further, branch operations are largely independent and lack&#13;
adequate supervision by head office. A new human resources management policy is required, including job&#13;
descriptions, performance evaluation, recruitment policy, etc. Although employees are now evaluated, the&#13;
evaluation is perfunctory. The intent of new human resources management policies should be to better&#13;
define accountability and evaluate and reward performance.&#13;
37.    Supervision by the board of directors is poor. Not only has the board of directors not provided&#13;
adequate supervision, it has interfered in the day-to-day operations of the bank, by-passing the normal&#13;
credit approval process. Rather than referring credit requests to the bank's lending staff so that the&#13;
applications could be evaluated in a normal manner, members of the board simply directed that the loans be&#13;
granted. This is a serious breach of fiduciary responsibility and bank policy. The directors should be held&#13;
personally responsible for the repayment of these loans. Clearly, there is a need to reconstitute the board of&#13;
directors with responsible members who can actively contribute in a positive way to the bank's restoration&#13;
to health. Further, the board's duties and responsibilities must be clearly spelled out. The board must&#13;
provide prudent and capable leadership while supervising the affairs of the bank in an informed and&#13;
responsible manner.&#13;
38.    At year-end, the bank had 366 employees in the head office and twelve branches. The supporting&#13;
staff, although better paid than the market, is poorly trained and lacks a customer service orientation.&#13;
Staffing levels are high and can certainly be reduced without any significant reduction in services. Training&#13;
of staff should be an important priority and requires serious attention.&#13;
39.    Asset Quality. Asset quality is unsatisfactory. The bank's loan portfolio is divided into the&#13;
following sectors: construction (26%), commercial (19%), transport (10%), industry (9%), others (23%),&#13;
and past due (13%). Unfortunately, information to allocate past dues by sector was not available, nor was&#13;
an aging of the past due accounts. In order to determine the financial condition of borrowers in these&#13;
sectors, detailed financial information is required. However, the financial statement information available to&#13;
the auditors was inadequate to evaluate repayment prospects. Nonetheless, past due loans, at 13% of loans&#13;
outstanding, are relatively high and, given the weaknesses described below, the condition of the portfolio is&#13;
likely to be much worse. At 12/31/94, the volume of the past due loans represented 65% of the bank's gross&#13;
capital funds (capital funds and loan loss reserves). This means that at least 65% of the bank's capital and&#13;
reserves is represented by assets which are problematic in nature. Despite the level of delinquencies, by&#13;
year-end 1994, not a single loan had been taken to court for collection. Only since the arrival of the new&#13;
president, and his personal efforts, has the bank become more aggressive in collections. The new president&#13;
recently engaged outside legal counsel to pursue collections on a commission basis.&#13;
40.   The numbers alone, however, don't tell the whole story. Based on an evaluation of the credit&#13;
process, the risks associated with the loan portfolio are significantly higher than indicated by the past due&#13;
amounts. The auditors report major weaknesses in loan approval and administration. For example, loan&#13;
files lack adequate information, including financial statements and collateral documentation; lending limits&#13;
are not controlled-there is no central information file or liability ledger on individual borrowers that would&#13;
capture a borrower's total loans outstanding; branches have independent credit tracking systems and&#13;
delinquencies at one branch are not communicated to head office or other branches; concentrations of credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60                                        ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 10 of 14&#13;
exist; collection activities are dispersed throughout the bank, rather than being centalized in a workout&#13;
unit; some loans lack guarantees and, even when a guaranty is obtained, the bank often fails to determine if&#13;
the guarantor has the capacity and character to repay if called upon; mortgages are not registered; real&#13;
estate is not appraised or valued; transactions are processed incorrectly; the conditions for obtaining credit&#13;
are not met; credit rules are not followed; accruals are posted incorrectly; etc.&#13;
41.    The auditors further report that the bank lacks policies to control credit risk. They note the lack of&#13;
uniform credit standards and rules for defining past dues, problem credits, and the treatment to be accorded&#13;
interest on non-performing assets, the need for a credit grading system, the lack of portfolio management&#13;
guidelines, and the need for more stringent underwriting standards, including the analysis of financial&#13;
indicators and economic factors.&#13;
42.    The amount of provisions for loan losses is determined by individual branches based on their past&#13;
due accounts. Unfortunately, because the branches do not report aging of their past dues, the head office&#13;
has no way of ascertaining the reliability of reported amounts and of determining the quality of these assets.&#13;
Because loans are not graded based on an assessment of a borrower's ability to repay, the amount of&#13;
provisions which have been established is alnost certainly inadequate. A comprehensive loan review is&#13;
necessary to ascertain the true situation.&#13;
43.    Given the difficulties in the lending area, it is clear that it needs a complete overhaul, including the&#13;
establishment of an internal loan review function and a loan workout unit.&#13;
44.    Problem assets, however, are not limited to the loan portfolio. Unreconciled differences between&#13;
trial balance amounts and the general ledger, large undocumented suspense accounts (488 million escudos&#13;
at 12/31/94), differences between head office and branch accounts, unreconciled due from bank accounts,&#13;
and various other asset amounts are subject to potential write-off. The situation is so grave that the auditors&#13;
were not able to resolve these situations during the course of their audit. Clearly, there will be losses&#13;
incurred from these operational deficiencies. However, the extent and size of the losses cannot be&#13;
determined at this time.&#13;
45.   Information on foreign exchange positions was not available because of the bank's unreliable MIS.&#13;
Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the bank has a significant exposure resulting from uncovered&#13;
positions in foreign currency. In practice, activities in foreign currency are limited to deposit-taking on the&#13;
liability side and cash, bank placements, and nostro accounts on the asset side of the balance sheet. Foreign&#13;
currency amounts in excess of $1.5 million must be sold to the Banco de Cabo Verde. Foreign currency&#13;
loans, borrowings, and off-balance sheet activities are not evident. Nonetheless, the inability of&#13;
management to provide the requested information demonstrates that the management of foreign exchange&#13;
risk must be strengthened.&#13;
46.    The investment portfolio is limited to Government bonds and a small equity participation (9% in&#13;
Garantia). The Government bonds, together with accrued interest, were given to the bank retroactively in&#13;
accordance with a protocol executed at the time of the bank's inception. The bonds represent the payment of&#13;
Government guarantees on loans to state-owned enterprises, i.e., an asset-to-asset swap. The bonds are&#13;
amortizing and range in maturity from 5 years to 30 years at tax-free interest rates of 5% to 10%.&#13;
47.   Fixed assets were transferred from the Banco de Cabo Verde at book value. However, there is no&#13;
idependent valuation of the fixed assets. Management states that the values assigned to some classes of&#13;
assets are questionable. The auditors report a need to take a complete inventory of assets and determine&#13;
realistic carrying values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61                                      ANNEX5&#13;
Page 11 of 14&#13;
48.    Earings. Eamings are poor. The provisional results for 1994 reflect a lack of core earins&#13;
needed to sustain the bank's future growth and viability. For the year ended, net profits were only 114&#13;
million escudos, or a return on assets of .56%. However, 112 million escudos of this amount is attributed to&#13;
net extraordinary gains. Operating profits were only 2 million escudos, or .01% of total assets. Tbese&#13;
amounts are provisional and do not reflect the potentially significant losses likely to be incurred fromn&#13;
opmerational deficiencies and a prudent classification and provisioning of loan risks. Additionally, the bank&#13;
has not accrued its potential tax liabilities for 1993 and 1994 (because of its ownership by the State, the&#13;
bank's tax status has not yet been decided) and the bank has potential unfunded pension liabilities which&#13;
could result in additional expense. These uncertainties, when resolved, are likely to worsen the bank's&#13;
provisional 1994 results and throw it into a loss position.&#13;
49.    Several factors contribute to the bank's poor 1994 earnings. First, only 60% of the bank's assets&#13;
are invested in earning assets. Nearly one-third of total assets are in cash and due from banks&#13;
(correspondant banks and the BCV) while the bank's loan to deposit ratio is only 28%. Interest income for&#13;
1994 was only 5.14% of total assets--nearly 250 basis points less than Calxa Economica. Although its cost&#13;
of funds was similar to Caixa Economica, its yield on earning assets was more than 300 basis points less.&#13;
For 1994, its yield on loans, before provisions, was 9.49% and for investments, 8.2 1%. Provision expense&#13;
was 1.65%oftotal assets.&#13;
50.    High cost (12%) emigrant deposits also contribute to the poor results. These deposits, aggregating&#13;
more than 4 billion escudos, cannot be invested profitably. In fact, given the bank's average yield on loans&#13;
during 1994 (9.49%/O), the bank has a negative spread and is losing money on these deposits. Given the&#13;
existing investment climate and interest rate levels, it is in the bank's interest, if not the Government's, to&#13;
discourage the taking of these deposits.&#13;
51.   Non-interest expenses are 2.89% of total assets. This percentage is not unreasonably high, nor is it&#13;
as significant as the factors discussed above. Nonetheless, cost cutting measures to reduce excessive&#13;
staffing and to close unprofitable branches should be considered as part of a package of measures to cut&#13;
costs and enhance revenues.&#13;
52.   If the Banco Comercial do Atlantico is to be restored to health, a strong, sound earnings stream&#13;
from core activities must be developed. This means that more assets must be placed in earning assets,&#13;
particularly higher-yielding, properly priced, loans. Banks traditionally maintain 85% or more of their&#13;
assets in earning assets and loan to deposit ratios around 65%. However, given the significant managerial&#13;
and operational weaknesses in the bank's lending activities, it may not be prudent to expand any further in&#13;
the loan area until all problems have been resolved and strong lending management, policies, and controls&#13;
are in place. Alternative investments are limited, mostly treasury bills and bank placements. Even tmough&#13;
the yields may be less than desired on these instruments, as compared to loan yields, it is better than having&#13;
money lay idle not earning interest at all. If funds can be properly employed, it is likely that the bank's&#13;
earnings can be improved. Nonetheless, without sound growth in the loan portfolio and the higher yields&#13;
available on loans, the bank's earnings are likely to remain depressed.&#13;
53.    Capital Adequacy. Capital is inadequate. Given the bank's many problems, the uncertainty&#13;
surrounding its financial condition and the adequacy of loan loss provisions, the high cost of restructuring,&#13;
and the lack of core earnings, the capital of the bank can only be viewed as insufficient to provide the&#13;
needed cushion for the losses which will be incurred. At year end, the bank's book capital was only 3.5% of&#13;
total assets. However, because of the large amount of lower risk assets such as cash, due from banks, and&#13;
investments, the bank's capital was calculated at 7.75% on a risk-weighted assets basis. Obviously, this&#13;
ratio would quickly change if the bank began to redirect its activities to the lending area, thus changing its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62                                    ANNEX5&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
mix of assets. The Government, recognizing the need for capital, placed an additional 250 million escudos&#13;
in the bank in June 1995. Another 250 million escudos is planned later in the year. Notwithstanding, until&#13;
the bank's hemoraghing can be contained and problems resolved, the adequacy of capital will be in doubt.&#13;
54.   Liquidity, Asset and Liability Management. The bank is excessively liquid. Funding for the&#13;
bank's activities is primarily provided through deposits, split evenly between demand and time deposits, and&#13;
including the high cost emigrant deposits discussed above. The excessive liquidity and the negative spread&#13;
on emigrant deposits are examples of poor asset and liability management practices which contribute to the&#13;
uninvested cash and idle balances in foreign bank accounts. The bank's management information systems&#13;
bank's unsatisfactory earnings. Cash management practices are also weak as the bank holds excessive do&#13;
not permit it to adequately monitor exposure to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Clearly, the&#13;
whole area of liquidity and asset and liability management is in need of significant strengthening.&#13;
55.   Internal Control and Internal Audit Activities. Internal controls are poor. The auditors report&#13;
cited numerous weaknesses in the bank's internal administrative and accounting controls--some significant.&#13;
Because of these weaknesses, the bank is vulnerable to fraud and embezzlement, as well as to operational&#13;
losses. While the backlog in data processing (reported to be as much as one year) is responsible for many&#13;
problems, there is no reasonable excuse for not performing regular reconcilements of accounts,&#13;
safeguarding the bank's physical assets, making sure of a person's identity when cashing a check, keeping&#13;
an inventory of checks and payment orders, etc. The lack of adequate internal controls is indicative of a&#13;
sloppy operation and poor management.&#13;
56.   The internal audit function is unsatisfactory. Despite its 366 employees, the bank has assigned only&#13;
one person to internal audit. For all intents and purposes, the internal audit function does not exist. This&#13;
area needs immediate attention as the weaknesses in internal control make the bank extremely vulnerable to&#13;
losses that could otherwise be prevented. A strong internal audit function could serve to remedy many of&#13;
the bank's internal control weaknesses, ensure adherence to bank policy, and safeguard bank assets. The&#13;
internal audit function should report directly to a reconstituted and strengthened board of directors.&#13;
57.   Future Prospects. Future prospects are poor. Unless strong and timely actions are taken to resolve&#13;
the bank's many problems and restore it to health, the bank will continue to be a drain on government&#13;
resources and a constraint to economic growth and development in Cape Verde. If the bank were not the&#13;
predominant banking institution in Cape Verde, one might argue for its closure and liquidation. However,&#13;
the Government is committed to restoring the bank to health, as well as to privatizing it in the near term.&#13;
Recommended actions for achieving these goals are contained in the attached action plan for restructuring&#13;
the bank.&#13;
58.   Technical Assistance Needs. A complete managerial, operational, and financial restructuring is&#13;
required if the bank is to be restored to health. The project will support the restructuring of the bank by&#13;
providing monies for engaging a supporting management team of experienced tumaround managers, an&#13;
updated management information system, and staff training.&#13;
(b) Action Plan to Restructure the BCA&#13;
59.   The principle problems of the BCA may be summarized as follows: Poor management and banking&#13;
culture, Unsound lending practices, Poor earnings and unsound financial structure, Inadequate intemal&#13;
accounting and administrative controls, Inadequate supervision of branches and delays in inter-branch&#13;
clearings, Poorly trained staff, Significant operational deficiencies, Government policies in the financial&#13;
sector, and Inadequate management information systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 13 of 14&#13;
60.   The first step in any restructuring of the bank must be the replacement of several layers of the&#13;
existing management with a new, professional management team. This is necessary to ensure that the&#13;
change in management is deep enough to change the existing banking and management culture. The new&#13;
management must have a clear mandate, and the freedom, to undertake all measures, no matter how&#13;
painful, necessary to restore the bank to health. Management must be able to operate without interference&#13;
from the Govermnent and the bank must not be used as a tool of Govenunent policy, whether directly or&#13;
indirecdy. Without a new, independent, and professional management team, all other measures are likely to&#13;
fail. The GOCV has agreed to this suggestion and a search is now underway to recruit an independent&#13;
management with excellent banking skills. This can be achieved also through a twinning arrangement with&#13;
a foreign bank to ensure good governance and complete change in culture.&#13;
61.   The new management team must be capable of taking tough and unpopular actions, particularly&#13;
with regard to pursuing collections on overdue credits, educating borrowers in the necessity of providing&#13;
current and satisfactory financial information, reorganizing and simplifying the bank's management&#13;
structure, introducing accountability, closing or scaling back unprofitable branches, and dispensing with&#13;
the services of unsatisfactory or redundant staff. Given this requirement, the managers should come from&#13;
abroad and have no ties or allegiance to Cape Verde or its residents. It is important to recognize that the&#13;
immediate objective of this management team is the clean-up and turnaround of the bank with the goal of&#13;
preparing it for full or partial privatization within a period of two, but not more than three years. New&#13;
business development will not be a priority until the bank's privatization, the expiration of the management&#13;
contract, and the appointment of successor management.&#13;
62.   The new management team will be responsible for preparing the plan for restructuring the bank.&#13;
The components should include the following measures:&#13;
-  strengthened governance by the board of directors, to include closer supervision of the bank's activities&#13;
through participation in standing committees (e.g., for audit, credit, etc.), more frequent meetings,&#13;
review of monthly management reports, status reports from management, etc.;&#13;
-  reorganization and simplification of the management and organizational structure with the intent of&#13;
eliminating duplication, enhancing lines of authority, better defining duties, responsibilities, and&#13;
accountability, improving communications, and strengthening decision-making;&#13;
-  automation of all major banking activities, with a particular emphasis on better integrating the branch&#13;
network and eliminating float between branches;&#13;
*  development of an effective and timely management information system so that management can make&#13;
decisions on an informed basis;&#13;
* strengthened internal accounting and administrative controls, including timely reconcilements of all&#13;
accounts and the write-off of stale reconciling items, unallocated account differences, and&#13;
undocumented suspense items;&#13;
*  introduction of cost accounting, profit centers, and transfer pricing with the objectives of better&#13;
defining costs so that unprofitable activities can be discontinued, scaled back, or improved, products&#13;
and services appropriately priced, and performance accurately measured and rewarded;&#13;
rationalization of staff and branches with the intent of optimizing efficiency and profitability. Banking&#13;
services can be provided in outlying areas in ways other than brick and mortar branches;&#13;
*  accrual of estimated corporate income tax liability for 1993, 1994, and 1995. Although the fiscal status&#13;
of the bank has not yet been determined, it is likely that taxes will have to be paid. Anticipating this&#13;
eventuality is prudent. Profits may be overstated in the amount of taxes which will be due and payable;&#13;
*  resolution of responsibility for unfunded pension liabilities resulting from the transfer of employees&#13;
from the central bank. An actuarial assessment should also be made of the bank's known pension&#13;
responsibilities to ensure that reserves are adequate;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                                  ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 14 of 14&#13;
strengthened lending practices to include better assessment of a borrower's ability to repay, better&#13;
monitoring through current and satisfactory financial information obtained throughout the life of the&#13;
loan, timely collection activities, closer supervision of branch lending activities, strengthened portfolio&#13;
management, and prudent recognition and provisioning of losses;&#13;
*  establishment of workout units and a department to carry out independent loan review on a continuous&#13;
basis;&#13;
*  implementation of formalized planning to include the formulation of a strategic plan, operating plan,&#13;
financial plan, and capital plan. The strategic planning process should involve management and staff at&#13;
* various levels of the organization and, when completed, major goals and objectives should be&#13;
adequately communicated to all staff;&#13;
* modification, as necessary, of written policies and procedures to ensure they are reasonable, complete,&#13;
and provide prudent guidance for management and staff within which they can be expected to operate.&#13;
Non-adherence to policy, except when a pre-established approval process for exceptions is followed,&#13;
should be grounds for disciplinary action and, possibly, dismissal;&#13;
*  reorganization of customer services, with a particular emphasis on eliminating heavy lobby traffic and&#13;
long waiting lines;&#13;
*  development and implementation of a comprehensive training program for staff. The training should&#13;
emphasize not only banking skills, but also a customer service orientation;&#13;
* an adequately staffed and strengthened internal audit function, reporting directly to the board of&#13;
directors and its designated Audit Committee;&#13;
*  development and grooming of a successor management;&#13;
*  a privatization strategy to be implemented when the bank is restored to health but, in no event, later&#13;
than three years.&#13;
63.   Additional financial resources may be necessary to offset loan and operational losses, maintain&#13;
adoquate capitalization, and finance restructuring activities. Given the absence of adequate information&#13;
regarding the bank's loan portfolio and financial condition, it is difficult to estimate the amount of resources&#13;
which will be required. However, the amount is likely to exceed the CVE 500 million in additional capital&#13;
to be placed in the bank during 1995.&#13;
64.   An alternative approach to dealing with the Banco Comercial do Atdantico is to minimalize it by&#13;
curtailing its growth, hiving off certain activities and branches through sales to new banks or branches as a&#13;
condition of entry, and supporting the growth and development of the better managed Caixa Economica de&#13;
Cabo Verde. The principle obstacle to this approach is that existing institutions and new mnarket entrants&#13;
alike will resist taking over problems that may affect the condition and operations of their own&#13;
organizations.&#13;
65.   Further to the BCA technical problems which can be addressed through this technical assistance&#13;
project, there is a need for the GOCV to review some of the policies affecting the financial sector. These&#13;
are for example,: (i) policies on emigrant deposits which forced commercial banks to paying higher rates&#13;
than on resident deposits (with the GOCV paying for additional premium) while lending opportunities&#13;
remained very limited; and (ii) interference of the GOCV in the financial sector by forcing banks to make&#13;
loans to state-owned enterprises. This issues are being addressed in this project through the letter of&#13;
development policy in which the GOCV has committed: (a) to liberalize interest rates on deposits and loans&#13;
before the end of 1996 and to let banks compete for business based on market conditions; and by pursuing&#13;
the privatizaion of public enterprises and banks so that new private institutions can be free to deal amongst&#13;
themselves only on pure conmmercial terms.&#13;

CAPE VERDE&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
ECONOMIC COST-BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Economic analysis of private-sector support projects in general causes some problems,&#13;
particularly when those projects aim to induce foreign private-sector investment. In recent Bank&#13;
SARs one finds a number of different approaches:&#13;
(a)    value of increased profit of private enterprises (benefit) attributed to project-financed&#13;
costs;&#13;
(b)   taxes payable in absence of tax holidays taken as "lowest bound" of benefits, and&#13;
attributed to project-financed costs;&#13;
(c)    surplus of benefits over costs of employed labor and earnings of economic processing zone&#13;
(as an enterprise) taken as benefits, and attributed to project costs;&#13;
(d)    expected capital investment of overseas entrepreneurs counted as a cost on the same basis&#13;
as project costs, and their profits included in benefits.&#13;
2.    The problem is essenfially one of deciding what costs, and what benefits can fairly be&#13;
attributable to the project. It really does not make sense to count private profits resulting from a&#13;
project on the benefits side when the private capital employed is not counted on the costs side&#13;
(example (a) above). The issue of ownership of costs and benefits also takes on a particular&#13;
importance when the costs are borne by foreign entrepreneurs, and the benefits accrue to those&#13;
same entrepreneurs on the clear ustanin that they may be freely remitted outside the host&#13;
country. There is also an intuitive reasonableness of treating taxes as project benefits in these&#13;
circumstances, instead of the conventional practice of treating them as internal transfers.&#13;
3.    The proposed Cape Verde project raises all of these issues. Its two main components are&#13;
to:&#13;
(a)    develop  export-oriented  manufcturing  and  infornation-technology-based  service&#13;
industries by attacting foreign investment and know-how by, among other things, developing an&#13;
Export Promotion Zone (EPZ);&#13;
(b)    develop the tourism sector, again primarily through foreign investment, and by, among&#13;
other things, developing infiastructure in potential towuist hotel locations..&#13;
4.    There is also a component to increase the efficiency of the financial sector, but this is&#13;
essentially a means to the end of achieving success in the other two main components. The&#13;
expenditurs on this sector are therefore assigned to the other sub-projects.&#13;
5.    The approach taken in this case was to accept that ownership of costs and beefits&#13;
mattered, and to confine the analysis to costs and benefits to "Cape Verde Inc." - the combination&#13;
of the Government and residents of Cape Verde. Foreignwed enterprises themselves, and their&#13;
foreign owners are not considered to be part of Cape Verde Inc. The justification for this is that the&#13;
decision that is faced by the Government, and its partner the Bank, is whether to use the scarce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
resources available to Cape Verde (including those it can borrow from IDA) to achieve future&#13;
benefits for the Government and people of Cape Verde. The issues of whether another corporation,&#13;
"Footloose Investors Inc." is behaving rationally in deciding where and how to use its own&#13;
investment resources to eam profits for itself, and whether that corporation is earning retums on its&#13;
capital of 0.5% or 50%/0, are not its direct concem. They are important in an indirect way, because&#13;
if the projects of Footloose Investors Inc. are not financially viable, Cape Verde Inc.'s project will&#13;
eventually fail. But the two lots of resources are not fungible, and the investing firms' internal&#13;
profitability calculations or criteria are not available to the Bank or the Govemment.&#13;
6.     The main benefit sought by the Goverrment is, without a shadow of doubt, local&#13;
employment at a wage that yields more than the opportunity cost of labor. The second benefit is&#13;
more fiscal resources (that the project should be at worst fiscally neutral might be regarded as a&#13;
precondition). Making the EPZ or the tourist zone into a directly profitable piece of public&#13;
entrepreneurship probably takes third place, way behind the other two aims. There are plenty of&#13;
circumstances in which a loss-making EPZ management corporation could be justified.&#13;
7.     Detemination of the opportunity cost of labor in Cape Verde is a matter of judgement.&#13;
Per-capita GDP is estimated at $800, and much of the population lives in even greater poverty than&#13;
this figure implies. Twenty-three percent of the working-age population is officially classified as&#13;
"unemployed". The fall-back occupation of most of the poor is very low-income subsistence&#13;
agriculture (because of very low rainfall, barren stony soils and arable land scarcity). It is therefore&#13;
arguable that the true opportunity-cost of labor is below $800. To err on the side of caution,&#13;
however, it was taken as $1,000. The current wage of unskilled formal-sector labor is $1,500,&#13;
and average wages in new foreign-owned enterprises were taken as $1,600 (since they include a&#13;
proportion of skilled labor).&#13;
8.    It is conventional in economic evaluations to ignore second-round effects, since these are&#13;
notoriously susceptible to exaggeration in order to pump up the ERR, and since the transactions&#13;
involved can conservatively be expected to take place at, or close to, the opportunity costs of the&#13;
factors involved. In the case of overseas direct investment, however, second-round employment&#13;
effects are also an important part of the beneficiary's objective, and as studies generally agree that&#13;
direct overseas investment generates considerably more employment indirectly than directly, it was&#13;
felt justifiable to take into account a conservative estimate of the employment benefits arising from&#13;
this. In the manufacturing component, one indirectly generated job was taken into account for&#13;
every directly-generated job, at a lower average wage rate of $1,280 (many of these jobs will be in&#13;
the informal sector). In the tourism component, a lower coefficient of half an indirectly-generated&#13;
job per directly-generated job was used.&#13;
9.    The other main benefits are revenues accruing to Government and public agencies from&#13;
rents and taxes. In cost-benefit analyses that are based on a modified enterprise profitabilty&#13;
calculation, these are ignored as transfer payments. In the Cape Verde Inc. approach they have to&#13;
be included, because they are payments from non-stakeholders in Cape Verde Inc. to stakeholders,&#13;
whereas the profits of the foreign-owned enterprises should be ignored as these are transfers&#13;
between non-stakeholders in Cape Verde Inc. Profit to owners of local enterprises providing&#13;
indirectly-generated employment should theoretically be included, but no safe estimate could be&#13;
made of these and they were ignored in the calculations. The overall approach was to see whether,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
on very conservative assumptions, the investments make sense for Cape Verde Inc. No shadow-&#13;
price was put on foreign exchange, as the Cape-Verde Escudo is effectively convertible.&#13;
First Component: Export-oriented Manufacturing Promotion&#13;
10.   For the first sub-project, the initial costs taken into account were the costs of PROMEX&#13;
(promotion agency) in support of this activity, the costs of the EPZ, including factory shells, a&#13;
share (50%/0) of overall anagme  costs, and a share (67%) of the costs of the financial sector&#13;
support in the project. Also included was $1.82 m2 of EPZ start-up costs and factory-shell&#13;
constuction undertaken on grant terms by the European Union and Luxembourg. These were&#13;
phased over four years. The allocation of the financial sector component cost between the&#13;
manYufacturing and tourism sub-projects is based on the importance of each in the total credit.&#13;
11.   The benefits side depends on a prediction of employment generation made by an&#13;
experienced consultancy group specialising in enterprise relocation. Their base case prediction was&#13;
that the project would directly create 3,740 jobs over four years. However, the promotional effbrts&#13;
of the Government and PROMEX created 800 jobs based on foreign direct investment in 1992-94,&#13;
so it is not legitimate to attibute all new employment in this sector to the project. To take this into&#13;
account, the number of directly created jobs attributed to the project has been reduced to 2,740.&#13;
Tese jobs are phased in over four years like the investment, but with a one-year lag. An equal&#13;
number of indirectly-generated jobs is phased in at the same time, at the same opportunity cost of&#13;
$1000 per year. A fiuther cost, assumed to continue over the full life of the project, is an allowance&#13;
of $200,000 per year for management of the EPZ, to be bome by the Govermnent of Cape-Verde.&#13;
12.   The labor benefits are the wages received by the diredy and indirectly-created jobs,&#13;
costed at $1,600 for the directly-generated jobs and $1,280 for those indirectly generated (the&#13;
tables show simply net benefit; i.e. wages less opportunity-cost). Based on PROMEX estimates,&#13;
rents are taken at $20 per square meter for pr-constructed factory-shells, and $2 per square meter&#13;
for factories built by entrepreneurs for their own occupation. Direct taxes only become payable&#13;
after the end of a ten-year tax holiday, at flat rates of 15% on overall profits plus 15% on any&#13;
distributed profits. These have been estimated very conservatively, with entrepreneurs being&#13;
assumed to have annual taxable income equivalent to only 7.5% of their initial investment, and to&#13;
pay distributed-profits tax on only half of this. There is undoubtedly a substantil further benefit&#13;
from indirect taxe and import duties, but this hard to  tumate and has been ignored. Taxes paid&#13;
on labor incomes are ignored here (as transfers between stakeholders in Cape Verde Inc.), but have&#13;
to be taken into account in the fiscal impad analysis (not covered here), where they are a&#13;
significant contributor.&#13;
13.   The opportunity-cost of capital (real cost) was taken as 12%, which may be considered as&#13;
a conservative yardstick.&#13;
14.   On this basis, the export-oriented manu icmonent has a positive NPV of&#13;
S7.56m (on cumulative project costs of S9m, including contributions from other donors), and an&#13;
iotemal rate of return of 31% over a project life of 15 years. This positive impact derives&#13;
prmminanly from the "surplus" accruing to directlyeated employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

15.   Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to identify the efficts of variancs f   tho&#13;

job-creation, and the swiching value for this variable at which the NPV booomes  -a is 1,430&#13;

substantially (if irrelevantly), while ERR faIls slightly.&#13;

Second Component: Tourism Promotion&#13;
17.   The tourism development plan aims to move from 1,100 hotel roams, 19,000 visitors, and&#13;
an average stay of six days in 1993 to 4,500 rooms, 62,000 visitors and an average stay of eight&#13;
days in 1999. The cost-benefit analysis is based on a more modest target of 750 new rooms , and&#13;
30,000 extra tourists by 1999, with average stay rising to eight days. Expendie per tourist-day&#13;
is estimated at $80 per head, of which $40 fbr the room, $20 for other in-hotel expenses, and $20&#13;
for out-of-hotel expenses. Cost of construction is $50,000 per room, of which 30% is for local&#13;
labor. Land for hotel construction is sold to the entrepreneurs at a margin over opportunity cost&#13;
(which is almost neglegible) of $20 per square meter. Direct job creation is one per room, and&#13;
indirect job creation 50% of direct (very conservative assumptions). Wages and opportunity-costs&#13;
are the same as in the manufacturing sector evaluation. A wide range of taxes is applicable on the&#13;
tourist sector receipts: rental tax, tourist tax, consumption tax and profits tax. Rental and profits&#13;
taxes have tax-holidays (5 years 100%, 10 years 50%/6), and receipts have been lagged in all cases.&#13;
Profits taxes were assumed to be paid on profits equivalent to only 7.5% of gross investment costs.&#13;
18.   The analysis yields a positive NPV of $8.31 million at 12% discount rate, and has an ERR&#13;
of 72%. The positive return again derives largely from the increment in earnings, but in this case&#13;
incremental taxes paid by non-stakeholders in Cape Verde Inc. also play a large part. This suggests&#13;
that there is scope to reduce the tax burden on the idustry if this is thought to be decisive i&#13;
achieving the targeted increases in tourist activity. The two principal risks are that investors will&#13;
not be attated, and that the desired tourist inflow will not materialise.&#13;
SensiHvity&#13;
19.   Sensitivity analyses were also camed out for the tounsm sub-cmponent. Again, the main&#13;
risks are shortfalls in hotel construction and number of tourists. Assuming that these two variables&#13;
remain in the same ratio, the switching point at which NPV becomes zero is 23% of the base level,&#13;
i.e., 175 new rooms, and 7000 additional tourists.&#13;
Combined lst and 2nd Components&#13;
20.   For the project as a whole, including the components for which benefits were not&#13;
quantified, the NPV and the ERR become S14.9 million and 370, respectively.&#13;

Are these results reasonable?&#13;
21.   The Cape Verde Incorporated approach has, in this case, given a very high rate of reurn,&#13;
that will inevitably give rise to some scepticism. It is true that a conventional approach that&#13;
includ  investors' capital and profits, and calculated overall value-addd modified by the shadow-&#13;
price of labor would yield very much lower NPVs and rates of return, but in fact it can fairly&#13;
easily be shown that these would simply be the sum, in the case of the NPV, and the weighted&#13;
average in the case of the ERR of the high rate of return for Cape-Verde Inc. and the lower rate of&#13;
return that the investors would be assumed (without any real evidence) to earn on their capital. An&#13;
example of this is given above in the sensitivity analysis in the manurin industry component.&#13;
The fact that this averaged result is lower deflects critical scrutiny, but does not make it any more&#13;
accurate. Indeed, it is probably less accurate. Moreover, it yields a result that is a far less useful as&#13;
a criterion of how Cape-Verde should use the resources it controls, or as an indicator of the&#13;
rewards to success in this enterprise.&#13;
22.   In fact, these high returns are a fair indicator of the rwards a poor, low-income country&#13;
can reap by successfully attracting foreign investment. The critical fictor is the probability or&#13;
plausibility of success. The cost-benefit of expending a worm to catch a large fish is very high, but&#13;
the ex-ante calculation is of little value unless the probability of success is taken into account. In&#13;
general, the less plausible (and hence the lower the cost) of a government's efforts to attract a given&#13;
quantity of overseas investmt, the higher will be the apparet ex-ante rate of return. What&#13;
matters far more is the coherence and plausibility of the promotion activities in question. At the&#13;
same time, a rather important conclusion is that even a promotion campaign that might be seen as&#13;
rather unsuccessful (as represented by the lower limits of the sensitivity analyses) can produce very&#13;
attractive nationally-owned returns - attractive enough to justify very considerable additional&#13;
expenditures if initial results fall short of expectations.&#13;

Economic Benefits of&#13;
Establishing an Industrial Park (IP)/Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Mindelo&#13;
23.   The establishment of an industrial park (IP)/export processing zone (EPZ) in Mindelo,&#13;
offers substantive economic benefits which are presented below. These include the creation of&#13;
direct and indirect employment, improvement in the balance of trade, foreign exchange earnings&#13;
and transfer of technology.&#13;
Direct and Indirect Employment&#13;
24.   On the basis of a study (Market Analysis and Demand Forecast), carried out by a&#13;
consulting group recruited by the GOCV, the Services Group, on the investment potential in the&#13;
export processing zone (EPZ) in Mindelo the following three scenarios for the take-up rate and&#13;
direct employment in the EPZ are possible:&#13;
(i) the base scenario assumes take-up of under-roof space of 41,140 m2 with 3,740&#13;
employees after 4 years;&#13;
(ii) the optimistic scenario assumes take-up of under-roof space of 70,400 m2 after 4&#13;
years. At the end of this period, the number of people employed at the IP/EPZ&#13;
will stand at 6,400;&#13;
(iii) the pessimistic scenario is based on a take-up at 24,640 m2 and 2,240 people&#13;
employed at the IP/EPZ after 4 years.&#13;
25.   Besides direct employment, foreign inward investment also generates indirect job creation&#13;
as a result of subcontracting and the need for services (maintenance, transportation, cleaning, etc.)&#13;
The ratio between direct and indirect job creation is difficult to stimulate beforehand. It is&#13;
generally accepted that this multiplier varies between 3 and 5 indirect jobs for each direct job&#13;
created. A multiplier of 4 is used in making the projections for the EPZ in Mindelo.&#13;
26.   On the basis of the above assumptions, the possible employment creation in the EPZ , over&#13;
a 4 year period, is as follows:&#13;

Indirect Employment        25,600              14,960               8,960&#13;
Total        32,000               18,700              11,200&#13;
The Balance of Trade&#13;
27.   Cape Verde's annual economic statistics show that the import coverage ratio has ranged&#13;
between 3 and 7% in the years 1983 to 1992 and that the deficit on the trade balance over the&#13;
same period was of ECV 6,800 million to ECV 8,800 million.&#13;

28.   In order to make an estimate of the potential contribution of the EPZ to the balance of&#13;
trade, Price Waterhouse/Plant Location has calculated the import to export ratio of the Mauritan&#13;
EPZ for the period 1988 to 1991 Intenational (Establishment of Industrial Parks and Export-&#13;
Processing Zones - Constraints and Perspectives - Cape Verde - Mindelo, Plant Location&#13;
International, Price Waterhouse, July 1994). This ratio is obtained by dividing the total value of&#13;
imports by the total value of exports. The ratio has varied between 0.58 and 0.83 which means&#13;
that for each US$ 100 of export from the EPZ, US$ 58 to 83 of import were required. The lower&#13;
this ratio the more favorable the contribution to the balance of trade.&#13;
29.   In the absence of a better yardstick, one can use this as a proxy to esfimate the impact of&#13;
the IP/EPZ's in Cape Verde on the balance of trade. lt is however difficult to predict what the&#13;
import to export ratio and export per employee will be for the IP/EPZ in Cape Verde. This will&#13;
largely be influenced by the nature of the activities locating in the IP/EPZ and the success in&#13;
commercializing the IP/EPZ.&#13;
30.   Estimates of the impact the IP/EPZ can have is presented in the following tables. Three&#13;
scenarios have been used to estimate the ratio of exports per employee. (In 1991, the Mauritius&#13;
EPZ realized total exports of US$600 million, while employment in the EPZ peaked at about&#13;
90,000. Exports per employee were therefore of US$6,700.) The base case assumes USS5,000 of&#13;
exports per employee, the optimistic scenario is based on USS 7,000 of exports per employee,&#13;
while the pessimistic scenario is calculated using US$3,000 per employee.&#13;
31.   Regarding direct employment at the IP/EPZ, the three scenarios as defined in the Market&#13;
Analysis and Demand Forecast study have been used (optimistic scenario 6,400 employees, base&#13;
case 3,740 employees, pessimnistic scenario 2,240 employees).&#13;
32.   The table below presents the impact on the trade balance of exports originating from the&#13;
IP/EPZ on the basis of an import to export ratio of 80%. Given a deficit on the trade balance&#13;
ranging from ECV 6,800 million to ECV 8,800 million in the period 1983 to 1992, these exports&#13;
would result in a reduction of the deficit ranging between 1.5 and 11 percent.&#13;

33.   The following table shows the impact on the balance of trade of exports originating from&#13;
the export processing zone, with an import to export ratio of 50%. Given a deficit on the trade&#13;
balance ranging from ECV 6,800 million to ECV 8,800 million in the period 1983 to 1992, these&#13;
exports would result in a reduction of the deficit ranging between 3.0 and 28 percent.&#13;

Government Income/Foreign Exchange Earnings&#13;
34.   Establishing the IP/EPZ will have an impact on the budget as a result of the role of the&#13;
GOCV in terms of incentive programs, etc.&#13;
35.   Forign direct inward investment has considerable impact on a govermnent's budget.&#13;
Direct government income is generated through all forms of direct and indirect corporate taxation.&#13;
Indirect income is created by means of personal taxation and employee contributions to social&#13;
security, and reduced expenditure on unemployment benefits.&#13;
36.   The direct effect on the GOCV's budget will be limited as companies licensed to operate&#13;
under the Free Zone scheme are not liable to pay taxes on corporate profits and dividends, and are&#13;
exempt of paying tariffs and duties.&#13;
37.   Export oriented operations generate foreign currency reserves for the Banco de Cabo&#13;
Verde. According to the Cape Verde Free Zone Pre-feasibility Study creating 500 to 1,500 jobs in&#13;
export-oriented industries could generate US$1 to US$3 million of foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
Other benefits&#13;
38.   Important benefits of an intangible nature will be derived from the foreign investents&#13;
made in the export processing zone, such as the transfer of know-how and technology .&#13;
Furthrmore, benefits will result from the training that the enterprises will provide, both locally&#13;
and abroad, to workers and managers.&#13;

CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND BANK SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
A. Supervision Strategy&#13;
1.     Effective project implementation will be the key to the development impact of the project&#13;
on the financial and private sectors in Cape Verde. Bank supervision strategy will pay special&#13;
attention to the project's development objectives of institutions in the financial sector (BCV, BCA,&#13;
Caixa Economica, ISCV, Previdencia) and in the private sector (PROMEX, Export Processing&#13;
Zone, chambers of commerce).&#13;
2.     Sustained supervision will be needed to keep this complex and multi-fiaceted project on&#13;
track and to monitor progress on the implementation of the various components.&#13;
3.     The mid-term review will be a critical event in the supervision process.&#13;
