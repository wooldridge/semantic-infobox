BACKGROUND:             Since the Peso devaluation in late December 1994, the&#13;
economic prospects for Mexico in 1995 are bleak, with negative&#13;
economic growth, high interest rates and the inflation rate for&#13;
1995 now  estimated  to  be about 42  percent.   Open&#13;
unemployment is already increasing and likely to increase&#13;
further, real wages will decline, and poverty rates will increase.&#13;
The Government of Mexico (GOM) is deeply concerned about&#13;
the dual impact of increasing poverty and the reduced budgetary&#13;
resources available for essential social services targeted to the&#13;
poor, and is trying to strengthen existing safety net structures&#13;
and protect key social service expenditures. In this context, the&#13;
GOM  is requesting US$500.0 million from  the IDB, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Hii&#13;
US$500.0 million from the IBRD to protect essential social&#13;
services and strengthen a low cost social safety net targeted to&#13;
the poorest and most vulnerable groups.&#13;
The proposed Program of Essential Social Services (PROSSE)&#13;
is recommended for financing by the two Banks for the&#13;
following reasons: (i) it is consistent with the Banks' country&#13;
assistance strategy and would complement other IDB-financed&#13;
projects for enhancing sustainable economic growth, poverty&#13;
alleviation, and human resources development; (ii) it would&#13;
provide a vehicle for rapidly transferring substantial foreign&#13;
exchange to Mexico to meet fiscal crisis; (iii) it would protect&#13;
essential social services and strengthen the social safety net&#13;
targeted to the poor in urban and rural areas; and (iv) it would&#13;
lay the foundation for efficiency gains in the high priority social&#13;
sector programs in the future.&#13;
OBJECTIVES:             The PROSSE has three objectives, to: (i) protect essential&#13;
social services for the poor, through the provision of&#13;
textbooks to all students, and, on a targeted basis, teaching&#13;
materials, maintaining access to pre-school, primary and lower&#13;
secondary education in isolated rural areas, and provision of a&#13;
basic health care package, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical&#13;
supplies, and community health outreach campaigns; (ii)&#13;
strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion the&#13;
poor from the effects of the economic crisis through retraining,&#13;
the creation of short term employment opportunities for the&#13;
unemployed and underemployed, and a nutrition program&#13;
targeted to vulnerable groups in the poorest areas; and (iii) lay&#13;
the foundation for measuring and implementing efficiency&#13;
gains in the social sectors over the medium term through&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
DESCRIPTION AND    The PROSSE has been designed as a time slice operation to&#13;
COST:                   finance ongoing high priority social sector programs within the&#13;
budget allocation as of February 1995. It consists of five sub-&#13;
programs: (a) basic education services; (b) basic health&#13;
services; (c) retraining and employment generation; (d)&#13;
nutrition program for vulnerable groups; and (e) monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of social sector programs. In each sub-&#13;
program, the GOM will seek to improve the efficiency of public&#13;
expenditure, within the constraints of the budget and the two-&#13;
year implementation period, using agreed monitoring and&#13;
evaluation indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
The total cost of the project is US$2,000.0 million of which&#13;
both the IDB and the IBRD will participate with US$500.0&#13;
million each. The IDB will finance the following: (i) Basic&#13;
Education Services. US$218.2 million for basic education for&#13;
the poor and basic education facilities; (ii) Retraining and&#13;
Employment Generation. US$274.8 million for short-term&#13;
employment generation in low-income urban and rural areas;&#13;
and (iii) Nutrition. US$2.0 million to improve the nutrition&#13;
status of the vulnerable groups in the poorest areas.&#13;
The proposed PROSSE would be implemented over a period of&#13;
two years and is expected to be completed by December 31,&#13;
1996 and the loan account to be closed by June 30, 1997.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL    The Environmental Committee (CMA), classified this operation&#13;
CLASSIFICATION:    in Category III, and the corresponding Environmental Summary&#13;
was approved on April 18, 1995. The IBRD classified this&#13;
program as category "B". Although no major environmental&#13;
issues are foreseen, the eventual inclusion of small civil works&#13;
projects, as part of the employment generation sub-program,&#13;
deserves the consideration of certain precautions and measures&#13;
to address the potential negative impacts. Since the eventual&#13;
small civil works will be executed through the Secretaria de&#13;
Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL), and should the need arise, the&#13;
environmental impact of sub-projects will strictly follow the&#13;
criteria and procedures already agreed with the GOM in the&#13;
Municipal Development Program (Loan 837/OC-ME).&#13;
BENEFTIS:              The project would help reduce possible increases in poverty&#13;
brought about by the economic recession, through preserving&#13;
essential social services for the poor, providing training and&#13;
employment  enhancement  opportunities  for  800,000&#13;
unemployed and underemployed workers over the two year&#13;
period through the Programa de Becas de Capacitacion para&#13;
Trabajadores (PROBECAT), plus approximately 550,000&#13;
short-term jobs in 1995 for the unemployed poor through the&#13;
SEDESOL Programa Especial de Empleo (PESE), providing&#13;
enhanced food and nutrition supplements to women and&#13;
children in priority areas. Indigenous populations will benefit in&#13;
particular from the services provided under the basic education,&#13;
health and nutrition components as these programs are targeted&#13;
to the poorest areas where the indigenous populations are&#13;
concentrated. The primary benefit of the PROSSE for the&#13;
selected services and programs is that it commits SHCP and the&#13;
executing agencies to support priority programs targeted to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
poor.&#13;
RISKS:                 The PROSSE may be subject to the following potential risks:&#13;
(a) Uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations. Mexico&#13;
continues to face a high degree of uncertainty in terms of&#13;
macroeconomic variables which determine the budgetary&#13;
ceilings. To this effect both Banks will monitor budgetary&#13;
releases carefully during implementation.   Should further&#13;
unexpected cuts be necessary, then the program size and targets&#13;
would need to be reduced.&#13;
(b) Program  diversity.  This risk is being mitigated by&#13;
concentrating upon a smaller number of agencies which already&#13;
have experience with the procedures of both Banks.  In&#13;
financing the PROSSE by the two Banks, three principles were&#13;
observed: (i) simple process, whenever possible an entire sub-&#13;
program would be financed by one of the Banks in its entirety&#13;
(such as the basic health services and the retraining for the&#13;
unemployed with the IBRD and the short-term employment&#13;
with the IDB); (ii) the experience of the agencies with either&#13;
one of the financing institutions; and (iii) in the case of nutrition,&#13;
the two Banks would finance equally given their intention to&#13;
collaborate in a proposed co-financed nutrition project in the&#13;
future. In education, both Banks have agreed to finance&#13;
specific activities in order to avoid overlapping and possible&#13;
conflicts related to procurement.&#13;
(c) Poor targeting and failure to make efficiency gains. All&#13;
of the PROSSE supported programs are all targeted to the poor&#13;
to varying degrees. Targeting effectiveness will be monitored&#13;
carefully during supervision and through the physical auditing&#13;
arrangements. PROSSE itself, through the sub-program&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation, will lay the foundation and develop&#13;
methodologies to measure and incentives to increase efficiency.&#13;
(d) Poor disbursements. Disbursements could be retarded as a&#13;
result of inexperience of some implementation agencies with the&#13;
Banks' procurement procedures. To minimize this risk, training&#13;
of procurement staff in these agencies will be organized as part&#13;
of the Banks' supervision programs, and technical assistance&#13;
will be provided by staff at the Banks' Resident Missions.&#13;
BANKS' STRATEGY:  The proposed loan is consistent with Mexico's Socioeconomic&#13;
Report (GN- 1778), and the Country Programming Paper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi&#13;
(CPP), as well as the IBRD's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS). The strategy focuses on the revival of growth, poverty&#13;
reduction   and   human  resources  development,  and&#13;
environmental sustainability. The proposed loan is critical to&#13;
the strategies of both Banks over the short and longer term.&#13;
The loan is one of the six operations proposed by the Banks to&#13;
respond to Mexico's current financial crisis. It provides a safety&#13;
net to the most vulnerable groups affected by the crisis and&#13;
helps maintain the gains achieved in social indicators in recent&#13;
years. Over the longer term, this project will continue the work&#13;
of both Banks in poverty reduction, and human resource&#13;
development, which remain key elements to achieving growth,&#13;
equity and sustainable development in Mexico.&#13;
RETROACTIVE            The proposed PROSSE will be disbursed over the two year&#13;
FINANCING:             period 1995-96, with the target of disbursing 60 percent of&#13;
these resources in the critical year of 1995. The Banks have&#13;
agreed to finance retroactively up to US$100.0 million each, to&#13;
help cover eligible expenditures for equipment, books, stipends,&#13;

1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Facing near-depletion of its foreign reserves, the Government of Mexico (GOM) was&#13;
compelled to float the peso on December 20, 1994. A severe currency crisis ensued and, as a result,&#13;
the economy is contracting sharply this year. The origins of the crisis, the Government's economic&#13;
program for dealing with it, and an assessment of medium-term prospects are detailed in the 1995&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which is being distributed concurrently with this&#13;
Memorandum.&#13;
1.2   The crisis in Mexico has prompted the Bank Group, in coordination with the International&#13;
Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United States and other G-10&#13;
countries, to respond with a major program of support. The proposed Program of Essential&#13;
Social Services (PROSSE) is an important component of the assistance efforts of the IBRD and&#13;
the IDB, in response to the crisis.&#13;
1.3   Economic conditions are expected to remain extremely difficult in Mexico over the next&#13;
18 months. Open unemployment has already risen sharply and is expected to increase further,&#13;
with estimates of up to one million job losses in 1995 (the unemployment rate had reached 5.7&#13;
percent by March 1995, its highest level since 1987). Real wages will also decline sharply and&#13;
poverty, which already affects about 34 percent of the population in varying degrees, is likely to&#13;
increase. The GOM's economic program calls for a very strong fiscal adjustment, which&#13;
necessarily requires major real cuts in aggregate public expenditures and defers a number of&#13;
important investment programs and projects.&#13;
1.4   These events may severely erode the hard sought social and economic progress that&#13;
Mexico has made over the past decade: Mexico overcame the debt crisis of the 1980s and&#13;
achieved sustainable economic growth after effecting a series of, oftentimes painful, structural&#13;
adjustments.  The previous administration introduced macroeconomic stabilization and an&#13;
ambitious public sector reform program. The stabilization program lowered inflation to single&#13;
digits (from 159 percent in 1987 to 7 percent in 1994) and the gross domestic product (GDP)&#13;
grew at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the period 1989-94. The administration&#13;
succeeded in re-negotiating the country's foreign debt, reducing public sector debt (from 75&#13;
percent of GDP in 1988, to 32 percent in 1993) and reducing the fiscal deficit. In addition to&#13;
correcting the main economic imbalances, including controlling inflation, improvements were&#13;
made in addressing social issues such as health, education and poverty reduction.&#13;
1.5   The GOM is deeply concerned about the possible dual impact of increasing poverty and&#13;
the reduced budgetary resources available for essential social services targeted to the poor, which&#13;
would put at risk any gains in social indicators over the last few years. The GOM is committed to&#13;
protect key social service expenditures and strengthen existing safety net measures. For that&#13;
reason, in its revised programmable budget for 1995, the GOM has increased the allocation to&#13;
social sector expenditures from 52.6 percent of the programmable budget (1994) to 55.4 percent&#13;
in 1995. In this context, the GOM aims to protect essential social services, strengthen social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
safety net schemes, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its social sector&#13;
expenditures through the PROS SE.&#13;
1.6   To help finance the PROSSE, the GOM is requesting US$500.0 million from the IBRD,&#13;
and US$500.0 million from the IDB, to be disbursed over the two year period 1995-96. The&#13;
PROSSE would:&#13;
(a)   consolidate and complement other projects financed by both Banks for enhancing&#13;
sustainable economic growth, poverty alleviation, and human resources&#13;
development (Chapter II);&#13;
(b)   provide a vehicle for rapidly transferring substantial foreign exchange to Mexico to&#13;
meet the fiscal crisis (Chapters II and IV);&#13;
(c)   protect essential social services and strengthen the social safety net targeted to the&#13;
poor in urban and rural areas (Chapters II and III); and&#13;
(d)   lay the foundation for efficiency gains in the high priority social sector programs in&#13;
the future (Chapter III).&#13;
2. BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL OVERVIEW&#13;
A. Background&#13;
(1) The Financial Crisis&#13;
2.1   Facing increasing pressure on the international financial markets, on March 9, 1995 the&#13;
GOM announced its new Economic Adjustment Program, superseding the previous program of&#13;
January 3, 1995. The development of the new program is based on assumptions that in 1995&#13;
GDP will fall by 2 percent in real terms and that inflation will run at 42 percent. The main targets&#13;
of the new program are to:&#13;
(a)   achieve a primary budgetary surplus of 4.4 percent of GDP for 1995;&#13;
(b)   limit net domestic credit creation to a maximum of N$10.0 billion for 1995,&#13;
(c)   achieve equilibrium in the current account after running a deficit of 8 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1994; and&#13;
(d)   restructure N$65.0 billion of outstanding debt of the private sector, representing&#13;
13 percent of the total commercial bank loan portfolio.&#13;
2.2   The budgetary surplus is to be achieved through a combination of increases in tax rates&#13;
and utility prices and cuts in expenditure. The program increases: (a) the VAT from 10 to 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
percent; (b) liquefied propane gas and electricity tariffs by 20 percent over and above monthly&#13;
adjustments of 0.8 percent; (c) gasoline and diesel prices by 35 percent; and (d) tariffs for airports&#13;
and railways by 2.5 percent per month.&#13;
2.3    A major feature of the program is that the GOM  intends to reduce public sector&#13;
expenditures by 9.8 percent in real terms for 1995 as compared with 1994. This represents an&#13;
additional reduction of 4.7 percent in real terms as compared with the January 1995 program. In&#13;
making the expenditure cuts, the GOM will give priority to maintaining social programs.&#13;
Expenditures for ongoing productive investments would also be maintained, but new investment&#13;
projects would be postponed. Low priority programs would be eliminated and existing vacancies&#13;
would be frozen. The existing system of subsidies would be revised.&#13;
2.4   On the monetary side, the GOM will continue to float the peso and let interest rates be&#13;
determined by market mechanisms. The private sector and unions are to negotiate freely their&#13;
wage and employment packages, subject only to meeting the minimum wage. The program&#13;
stipulates a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage starting April 1, 1995, and including a 3&#13;
percent fiscal credit (reverse income tax) to those workers earning between 2 and 4 times the&#13;
minimum wage. The GOM has also developed a series of financial mechanisms to protect the&#13;
liquidity of the banking system and avert widespread insolvency. These mechanisms are being&#13;
supported by the [BRD and the IDB through a Financial Sector Restructuring Loan in parallel&#13;
with PROSSE.&#13;
(2) The Federal Budget of the Social Sectors&#13;
2.5   The GOM has stressed the critical importance of human capital development in economic&#13;
development in both its policy statements and in its budgetary allocation decisions. Between 1988&#13;
and 1994, the GOM redirected its operating and investment budgets away from the industrial and&#13;
energy sectors and towards the social sectors. In the federal programmnable budget, the shares of&#13;
the energy and industrial sectors shrank from 27.4 and 12.9 percent of the total budget in 1988 to&#13;
20.0 and 0.3 percent of the budget in 1994, while the share of the social sector budget climbed&#13;
from 33.2 percent in 1988 to 52.6 percent in 1994 (see Annex 1). This reallocation allowed the&#13;
operating expenditures of the social sectors to grow at an average real rate of 11.5 percent at a&#13;
time when the share of total public sector operating expenditures in GDP stayed roughly constant&#13;
(18.9 versus 19.2 percent) and real GDP grew slowly.&#13;
2.6   Even before the recent economic crisis, it was apparent that the period of major&#13;
readjustment of the budget was over and, as a result, the rate of increase in social sector&#13;
expenditures would depend more strongly on the rate of increase of GDP than it had in the past&#13;
six years.  There were no longer the same possibilities for reallocating among budgetary&#13;
categories as there was in 1988 when the energy and industrial sectors were considerably larger.&#13;
The pre-crisis planned budget for 1995 reflected this slowdown. The share of the social sectors in&#13;
the operating budget was programmed to increase slightly from 52.6 to 55.2 percent. Partly as a&#13;
result of this modest reallocation, but mainly as a result of an expected 4 percent real rate of&#13;
increase in GDP, prior to the crisis the GOM planned that, in 1995, social sector expenditures&#13;
would grow by 10.9 percent in real terms.&#13;

(a) 1995 Budget as of December 1994.&#13;
1995 Budget as of Februaiy 1995.&#13;
2.7    The events since December 1994 have altered drastically these planned expenditures. In&#13;
January 1995 the government prepared a new 1995 budget that incorporated a real decline of 5.1&#13;
percent in total public sector expenditures. The revised budget still maintained a real increase in&#13;
the social sector budget, but reduced significantly the real rate of increase. The real rate of&#13;
increase in social sector operating budget fell from 10.9 to 1.5 percent. Because the impact of the&#13;
cuts fell more heavily on other sectors, the share of the social sectors in the total budget grew&#13;
from 55.2 to 55.4 of the total operating budget. In current pesos, the total operating budget of&#13;
the social sectors is N$149.9 billion and the investment budget is N$23.2 billion. The total size of&#13;
the PROS SE program amounts to 7.7 percent of the total operating and investment budget of the&#13;
social sectors. Further details of the federal governmnent budget are presented in Annex 1.&#13;
2.8   In March 1995, the Government announced further cuts in spending in real terms with the&#13;
objective of reducing total public sector expenditures by 9.8 percent in real terms as compared&#13;
with 1994. While social sector expenditures are to receive a high priority, and in particular the&#13;
programs supported under PROSSE, the GOM is still finalizing the budgetary framework and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
allocations to specific ministries and programs and will complete the exercise by June 30, 1995.&#13;
The task of identifying priority programs for the PROSSE began after the February 1995 budget&#13;
cuts had been decided. Some of the PROSSE priority programs had already taken severe budget&#13;
cuts. It is the goal of the PROSSE to ensure that the essential social services it has identified as&#13;
priorities will be protected from subsequent budget reductions. During negotiations, the GOM&#13;
confirmed with the Banks that: (a) the GOM would endeavor to execute budgetary policy in&#13;
the social sectors, including mechanisms to protect budgetary allocations to the PROSSE&#13;
during the financial crisis and measures to increase efficiency of social sector expenditures,&#13;
according to the agreed letter of policy intent, which is included in the project file (para. 7.1&#13;
(a)); and (b) the GOM would release budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the executing&#13;
agencies under PROSSE in 1995 in accordance with the agreed 1995 budget allocations and&#13;
physical targets included in Annex 2 and that the GOM may substitute an alternative budget,&#13;
if satisfactory to the Banks, for the PROSSE prior to June 30, 1995 (para. 7.1 (b)).&#13;
(3) Poverty in Mexico&#13;
2.9   As key objective of the GOM is the reduction of poverty in Mexico. Expenditures in the&#13;
social sectors are a central element in the GOM's poverty reduction strategy. In 1992, 25.4&#13;
percent of Mexico's 84 million people were living in poverty, of whom 13 million were living in&#13;
conditions of extreme poverty. Although the majority of Mexico's population (73.7%) live in&#13;
urban areas, extreme poverty continues to be disproportionately a rural phenomenon, whose&#13;
impact is greatest on the country's indigenous people. In 1992, 56 percent of the extreme poor&#13;
lived in rural areas and were engaged in agricultural activities. Poverty increased dramatically in&#13;
Mexico with the onset of the 1982 macroeconomic crisis, as per capita GDP and public&#13;
expenditures declined considerably. Between 1982 and 1988, real per capita GDP dropped by 10&#13;
percent from US$4,160 to US$3,720.&#13;
2.10  Since 1989, the overall economy has begun to recover and per capita GDP has risen&#13;
slightly to US$3,960 in 1992, although it still remains below its 1982 level.  In addition,&#13;
expenditures on health, education and poverty programs have increased sharply and the rate of&#13;
extreme poverty in Mexico has declined almost to its 1984 level.  Nevertheless, regional&#13;
differences remain very strong, with the poverty rate in the poorest states being ten times that of&#13;
richer states. The greatest differences are seen between the states of the center and north which&#13;
are either industrialized or have large expanses of irrigated agriculture and those of the southeast&#13;
which have little industrial development and depend on rainfed agriculture. Moreover the IBRD's&#13;
analysis of the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de Hogares (ENIGHs) surveys for 1984,&#13;
1989, and 1992, shows:&#13;
* In 1992, the poverty gap (or measure of the average percentage by which the poor's income fell&#13;
short of the poverty line) was 8.3 percent, up from 7.4 percent in 1984, although an improvement&#13;
over 9.2 percent in 1989.&#13;
* Poverty is predominantly, and increasingly over time, a rural problem - 49 percent of the poor and&#13;
84 percent of the extreme poor live in rural areas in 1992 compared 47 percent and 75 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
respectively in 1984 - whereas the rural population accounts for only 41 percent of total&#13;
population.&#13;
*  In 1992, Mexico's Gini coefficient (measure of income inequality) was very high at 0.533, a&#13;
significant increase over 1984 at 0.473.&#13;
*  Income is slightly more unevenly distributed in urban areas, with a Gini Coefficient of 0.493 in&#13;
1992 compared to 0.451 in rural areas - however, with a national Gini Coefficient of 0.533, it is&#13;
evident that the inequality between urban and rural areas is a major determinant of overall&#13;
inequality.&#13;
* The bottom 5 percent of the population earns only 0.5 percent of national income, whereas the top&#13;
5 percent earns 29.5 percent of national income; similarly, the bottom quintile earns 3.6 percent and&#13;
the top quintile 58.3 percent.&#13;
.&#13;
2.11 Moreover the GOM is cognizant of the impact of the financial crisis, and ensuant&#13;
recession, in reducing income levels and thereby increasing poverty. Therefore the GOM is&#13;
determined to strengthen its social safety net to protect the poorest within its fiscal constraints.&#13;
This it intends to do through labor retraining (para. 3.12), short-term employment generation&#13;
(para. 3.15), a rural nutrition program (para. 3.18) and formulating policies for the more effective&#13;
use of resources allocated to food subsidies/ and income transfers to the poor in urban areas.&#13;
B. Government Strategy for the Social Sectors&#13;
2.12   The GOM  strategy in the social sectors emphasizes the critical importance of human&#13;
capital development in economic development and the important role of the state in interventions&#13;
which have: (a) a high public goods element (e.g. preventive care for contagious diseases); (b)&#13;
economies of scale (e.g. textbook printing); and (c) failures of the market (e.g. lack of service&#13;
provision for the poor and marginalized). During a period of economic crisis, the key objectives&#13;
of public policy in the social sectors are the following:&#13;
*  targeting, programs targeted to the poor will receive priority in terms of budget allocations;&#13;
*  efriciency, with scarce resources, the GOM wants to obtain the maximum output per unit&#13;
input, redirecting resources to the most effective programs in terms of their outcomes per unit&#13;
invested;&#13;
*  consolidation, a key element in increasing efficiency is to eliminate overlapping programs,&#13;
such as in nutrition, and concentrate resources on a smaller number of effective programs;&#13;
*  protection, during a time of crisis, the GOM wishes to protect programs of a high socio-&#13;
economic priority; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
redirection, over the medium term the GOM wishes to redirect resources to social sector&#13;
programs which manifest greater efficiency as an incentive mechanism for improved&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.13  Within education, the GOM recognizes the problems and has developed an education&#13;
strategy to ensure the provision of the basic inputs required to raise the quality of instruction in&#13;
the country and to ensure that all children have adequate access to basic education. This strategy&#13;
is implemented through programs which: (i) deliver instructional materials, especially textbooks to&#13;
all school children; (ii) provide basic school facilities and equipment; and (iii) encourage&#13;
community and parental involvement in the school. Over the last six years the Government has&#13;
implemented a comprehensive reform of the education sector, including the decentralization of the&#13;
system.&#13;
2.14   Since 1991, the Banks have supported this strategy through its financing of the Primary&#13;
Education I (Programa para Abatir el Rezago Educativo - PARE - Loan 3407-ME) , Pfimary&#13;
Education II (Programa para Abatir el Rezago en Educacion Bdsica - PAREB - Loan 3722-&#13;
ME), Initial Education (Loan 3518-ME) projects and PIARE (Programa Integral para Abatir el&#13;
Rezago Educativo - Loan 846/OC-ME), with aggregate financing of US$1,135.0 million. These&#13;
projects seek to increase education quality through a variety of targeted interventions in the states&#13;
with the worst educational indicators, which were partly the result of the sharp decline in&#13;
educational expenditures during the debt crisis of the 1980s.&#13;
2.15  The current financial crisis and ensuing reductions in real Government expenditures puts at&#13;
risk the implementation of the Government's strategy during 1995 and 1996, including the timely&#13;
execution of the Banks' financed projects. To minimize this risk and ensure continued delivery of&#13;
education services, the proposed program would provide support for the most essential programs&#13;
of the Government's strategy. The Secretariat of Education (SEP) and the Banks have reached&#13;
agreement that these are essential programs to increase equity in access and quality. The program&#13;
would support the GOM by financing selected programs of three federal agencies as follows:&#13;
National Council for Educational Development (Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo:&#13;
CONAFE), Federal School Construction Committee (ComiMt Administrativo del Programa&#13;
Federal de Construccion de Escuelas: CAPFCE) and National Textbook Commission (Comisi6n&#13;
Nacional de los Libros de Texto Gratuitos: CONALITEG).&#13;
2.16  In the health sector, the GOM strategy focuses upon interventions to reach the most&#13;
disadvantaged areas in the poorest states. Efforts are being made to fulfill the mandate of the&#13;
SSA to determine sector priorities, re-allocating resources from curative to preventative health&#13;
interventions and transferring decision-making power from federal to state health authorities&#13;
(SHAs) and health jurisdictions, respectively. The ongoing IBRD financed Basic Health Care&#13;
project (PASSPA I -Loan No.3272-ME, FY90) supports these initiatives in four states' and a&#13;
Second Basic Health Project, scheduled for FY95, is under way to support an additional five&#13;
states.&#13;
I Oaxaca, Chiapas, Gueffero, Hidalgo and the Federal District.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.17  However, these measures, which increased federal health spending from 2.8 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1988 to 4.1 percent in 1993 (accounting for 17.5 percent of total federal expenditures),2&#13;
have been only partially effective. Access to health services and their low quality continue to be&#13;
problems, particularly in the poorer states. The effectiveness of the public health budget is&#13;
impaired by institutional fragmentation, managerial weakness and duplication of services, resulting&#13;
in a loss of efficiency, equity and quality.&#13;
2.18  The new administration intends to rationalize resource allocation, to search for alternatives&#13;
to sole Government provision and financing of health services and to strengthen the role of the&#13;
private sector. However, it aims to first address the basic health care problems in the poorer&#13;
states in order to establish a sound basis for later launching a major sectorwide reform program.&#13;
The new Government intends to deliver a cost-effective basic health care package which includes&#13;
both primary health care interventions and essential clinical services, while simultaneously&#13;
supporting institutional, technical and financial reform efforts aimed to improve the health&#13;
conditions of 33 million uninsured and underserved poor. More specifically, it intends to support:&#13;
(a) equitable access to a cost-effective package of basic health services for the uninsured and&#13;
underserved; (b) decentralization of health administration and delivery, as well as improvement of&#13;
technical, managerial and financing processes in the states, to improve health service effectiveness&#13;
and increase the efficiency of resource use; and (c) modernization and realignment of the SSA to&#13;
assume an active leadership role in the health sector. Those objectives would be accomplished by&#13;
investments at local levels in accordance with criteria, previously agreed with the federal&#13;
government. Under state guidance, local health jurisdictions would define risk areas and prepare&#13;
annual investment programs to be financed by the federal Government as part of the&#13;
compensation program. Competition and incentives would be introduced for states and local&#13;
health jurisdictions to prepare the investment programs.&#13;
2.19  In employment, the GOM  recognizes the critical importance of both facilitating the&#13;
movement of labor from declining sectors to growing sectors as a result of the financial crisis&#13;
through the Labor Retraining Program for the Unemployed (Programa de Becas de Capacitaci6n&#13;
para Trabajadores: PROBECAT), and the need to bolster the demand for employment over the&#13;
short term through the creation of a Special Employment Program (Programa Especial de&#13;
Empleo: PESE).&#13;
2.20  In view of the declining employment prospects (paras. 2.46-2.47) in the urban and&#13;
manufacturing sectors, the GOM has decided re-orient the PROBECAT for at least 150,000 of&#13;
the 350,000 target trainees for 1995 (this compares to training of some 50,000 displaced workers&#13;
annually over the period 1988-93) by linking up basic on-the-job skills training and short-term&#13;
employment generation through infrastructure rehabilitation programs, training for self-&#13;
employment and training of new staff within small and medium enterprises (SME's).&#13;
2.21  In addition, the GOM  has announced a short-term  employment program  to create&#13;
approximately 550,000 new jobs (of six months duration) in public works programs in areas of&#13;
poverty and high unemployment. The GOM announced the PESE, on March 17, 1995, at a cost&#13;
2Source: Cuenta Publica y PEF, 1993-1994 (Gasto total consolidado)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
of N$1.7 billion for 1995. The main objective of the PESE is to offer temporary employment to&#13;
impoverished heads of families and, therefore, improve the living conditions of those groups that&#13;
suffer the most extreme conditions of poverty. The compensation level paid to beneficiaries&#13;
would be set at 80 percent of the minimum wage of the appropriate zone3, thereby self-targeting&#13;
to the poor.&#13;
2.22  The PESE will use the framework of the Municipal Solidarity Funds (Fondos de&#13;
SOLIDARID Municipal: FSM) within the framework of National Solidarity Program (Programa&#13;
de SOLIDARIDAD  Nacional: PRONASOL).  PRONASOL  is managed by the Social&#13;
Development Secretariat (SEDESOL) and funded through a single federal budget line (Ramo 26)&#13;
which is combined with state funds based on the annual Social Development Agreement signed&#13;
every year by SEDESOL with each state. The FSM is well-designed for this purpose as it&#13;
operates under the following principles and guidelines: (a) community participation in project&#13;
selection and implementation through Solidarity Committees; (b) poverty targeting; (c)&#13;
decentralization and shared responsibility for Solidarity programs with state and municipal&#13;
governments; and (d) sharing of program costs among the federal government, states,&#13;
municipalities, and beneficiary communities.&#13;
2.23 In the nutrition sector, the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo announced in&#13;
February 1995 a new national nutrition program as one of the key elements of the new&#13;
administration's poverty reduction program.  The President committed the Government to&#13;
implement highly cost-effective nutrition programs targeted to the 127 municipalities which&#13;
exhibit very high poverty and nutritional risk in nine states (12 regions with the highest poverty&#13;
index in these states). One of the four nutrition-food-health programs identified in this proposal is&#13;
the cost-effective integrated nutrition program, based on the pilot program financed by&#13;
SEDESOL and SSA, with IBRD and IDB support, in the poorest regions of three states in 1991.&#13;
2.24  While the economic adjustment effort is laying the basis for more equitable growth, a&#13;
coherent food entitlement policy and nutrition strategy needs to be defined. The Government is&#13;
currently analyzing the existing programs with the purpose of rationalizing investments, improving&#13;
coordination and targeting and alleviating poverty by reaching the most vulnerable groups of the&#13;
population through targeted food and nutrition interventions, or direct income transfers.&#13;
C. Program Selection Criteria&#13;
2.25  PROSSE is a two year time-slice operation supporting the highest priority social sector&#13;
programs. The programs were selected from the sectors of education, health, employment and&#13;
nutrition according to the following criteria in order of importance:&#13;
(a)   poverty targeting, the programs should target either the poor (e.g. health and&#13;
education) or vulnerable groups of the poor (e.g. nutrition for pregnant women&#13;
and small children);&#13;
3 The minimum wage in Mexico is set for three different geographical zones based differentials in the cost of&#13;
living.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
(b)   safety net, the programs should provide and element of a safety net to protect the&#13;
poor from the worst effects of the crisis (e.g. employment programs);&#13;
(c)   human capital formation, the programs should contribute to maintaining or&#13;
enhancing human capital; and&#13;
(d)   size, the programs should be of sufficient size to make a significant social and&#13;
economic impact and to be able to absorb significant amounts of external&#13;
financing.&#13;
D. Issues in the Essential Social Services Program&#13;
2.26  The impact of social sector expenditures on the welfare of the poor was never as positive&#13;
as suggested by the rising expenditures between 1988 and 1994, nor as bleak as would appear&#13;
from the likely cut in expenditures in 1995 and beyond. In the past, the increasing expenditures&#13;
allowed the social sectors to recover from the sharp cuts that resulted from the 1982 crisis and to&#13;
improve social indicators. However, having budgets rising significantly every year reduced the&#13;
incentives to pay attention to efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Thus, in education, health and&#13;
employment substantial inefficiencies remain, some of which are detailed below.&#13;
2.27  The PROSSE program attempts to improve efficiency in both the short and medium term.&#13;
In the short term, PROSSE creates a distinction between pre-existing programs that are included&#13;
in the program and those that are judged less essential and thus excluded. This can generate a&#13;
reallocation of expenditures as future budget cuts will fall on programs outside of PROSSE and&#13;
secondly, even if there are not further budget cuts, SHCP would have an incentive to release&#13;
funds to the PROSSE programs first because program expenditures would be reimbursed with&#13;
foreign exchange. Under PROSSE, the two Banks will finance both the investment costs of the&#13;
programs supported, and also the non-wage operating expenses, which would have been cut in&#13;
the absence of the Banks' financial support, thereby undermining service delivery of these key&#13;
programs.&#13;
2.28  The Banks will provide technical assistance through the loans and through supervision, in&#13;
the implementation of the safety net programs, the nutrition and employment programs. In the&#13;
medium term, the Banks would help support an effort to improve monitoring of outputs in the&#13;
social sectors and to link performance to budgetary allocations.&#13;
Education&#13;
2.29  Mexico has assigned high priority to human capital investment as part of its economic&#13;
development strategy. Since 1950 adult illiteracy has decreased from 40 percent to about 13&#13;
percent; the number of schools has more than tripled; the number of teachers has quintupled; and&#13;
school enrollments have increased sevenfold as the total population increased only threefold. As a&#13;
result, by 1994, 76 percent of children aged 4-5 had access to preschool education, net enrollment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
rate for primary education reached 98 percent and net enrollment for lower secondary reached 88&#13;
percent. In 1993, total preschool enrollment was 1.9 million children attended to by a network of&#13;
51,554 schools and about 114,300 teachers; total primary school enrollment (grades 1-6) was&#13;
14.8 million children, attended to by a network of 88,918 primary schools and about 510,800&#13;
teachers; total lower secondary enrollment (grades 7-9) was 4.2 million children attended to by a&#13;
network of 20,032 lower secondary schools and about 151,000 teachers.&#13;
2.30 The formal education system in Mexico includes a well-designed and mainly non-formal&#13;
initial education (ages 0 through 3), two-year preschool, nine years of mandatory basic education&#13;
(six-year primary education and three-year lower secondary education that had recently been&#13;
integrated), three or four additional years of upper secondary education, and three to six years of&#13;
undergraduate and graduate university education. The public sector provides educational services&#13;
for 90 percent of total enrollment. Preschool and primary education are provided in three&#13;
modalities, general preschool and primary education; bilingual or indigenous preschool and&#13;
primary education, and the CONAFE (National Council for Educational Development - Consejo&#13;
Nacional de Fomento Educativo) preschool and primary education models for small communities&#13;
in remote rural areas.&#13;
2.31  In the education sector, failure to protect essential basic education (preschool, primary and&#13;
lower secondary) expenditures could undermine the very high net enrollment rate of 98 percent,&#13;
particularly for children in poor and isolated rural areas and indigenous populations, prevent&#13;
attainment of increased access for these groups, and improvement in the quality and efficiency of&#13;
basic education. The GOM is seeking to protect investments in essential inputs to the sector,&#13;
such as textbooks, so that educational quality, cognitive achievement, and thus the efficiency of&#13;
expenditures across the sector, can be maintained, and so that the basic educational opportunities&#13;
for the vulnerable poor can be expanded.&#13;
2.32  Moreover, despite recent educational achievements, there is still a problem of inadequate&#13;
access for the children of the rural poor, especially indigenous children in isolated areas. The&#13;
population without access to preschool, primary, and lower secondary education is characterized&#13;
by extreme poverty, geographic isolation, and early entry into low-paying positions in the labor&#13;
market.&#13;
2.33   Although management and operation of all initial, preschool, primary, lower secondary&#13;
education, and teacher training institutions were transferred to the states in 1992, including annual&#13;
budgetary transfers amounting to over N$30.0 billion, the federal Secretariat of Education (SEP)&#13;
still has a leadership role on: (a) preparation and enforcement of educational policy norms; (b)&#13;
curriculum development and textbook production; (c) support of educational research; (d)&#13;
operation of the evaluation system; and (e) design and financing of compensatory and special&#13;
programs for an equitable distribution of education services, especially for those states with&#13;
poorer indicators of educational development. Among the most important federal programs to&#13;
improve coverage and quality of education are those being carried out by CONAFE,&#13;
CONALITEG, and CAPFCE of SEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.34  CONAFE is a decentralized agency, located within SEP, charged with designing and&#13;
implementing Federal Government financed compensatory education programs targeted on the&#13;
poor, indigenous groups, and on children living in poor or remote rural areas. The CONAFE&#13;
community school system, in which specially trained lower secondary graduates volunteer to&#13;
teach in schools built and maintained by the communities themselves, has been designed to&#13;
overcome the problem of constructing and staffing schools in remote areas where it is difficult to&#13;
attract and retain teachers and where, given the small size of the community, it would be&#13;
extremely costly to establish regular schools. CONAFE manages all basic education expansion&#13;
and improvement programs designed by SEP as part of the Compensatory Education Programs of&#13;
the federal Government for educationally deprived states. The Banks are supporting these&#13;
programs through the Initial Education Project (Loan 3518-ME), First and Second Primary&#13;
Education projects (Loans 3407-ME (PARE) and 3722-ME (PAREB), respectively) and by the&#13;
Programa Integral para Abatir el Rezago Educativo (PIARE) funded by the IDB. Programs&#13;
currently administered by CONAFE include:&#13;
2.35  Programs currently administered by CONAFE include:&#13;
*  The rural community primary school program started in 1973, provides schooling for children&#13;
living in rural villages of under 100 population with between 5 and 19 school-age students.&#13;
The program trains lower secondary school graduates to teach in facilities provided by the&#13;
communities themselves. These teachers receive room and board provided by the community;&#13;
receive a small teaching stipend; and, upon completion of 1-2 years of teaching, receive a&#13;
scholarship to permit them to complete upper secondary schooling. The program currently&#13;
serves 160,000 children in 15,000 community built schools.&#13;
*  The rural community preschool program started in 1980. It is similar in design and operation&#13;
to the rural community primary school program administered by CONAFE. These currently&#13;
serve more than 55,200 preschool children in 5,330 community built preschools, each having&#13;
one volunteer teacher.&#13;
*  The migrant children program, Atenci6n Educativa a Poblaci6n Infantil Agricola Migrante,&#13;
started in 1989, now operates in about 900 locations in nine states, providing education to&#13;
8,700 children of immigrant workers.&#13;
*  The indigenous children program, Proyecto de Atenci6n Educativa a Poblaci6n Indigena,&#13;
started in 1994, provides preschool education opportunities for indigenous children living in&#13;
260 communities and provides primary schooling to indigenous children living in 600&#13;
communities.&#13;
*  The Solidarity Schools program provides educational materials and improved school facilities&#13;
to 680,000 children and 25,000 teachers located in 9,500 traditional schools in urban marginal&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
*  The instructor scholarship program, Sistema de Estudios a Docentes, provides financial&#13;
assistance to community teachers in the rural community preschool and primary education&#13;
programs to permit them to complete upper secondary schooling.&#13;
*  The student boarding program, Financiamiento Educativo Rural that started in 1984, finances&#13;
the transportation or the boarding costs of rural students who must go or live away from&#13;
home because their home communities do not provide schooling opportunities.&#13;
2.36 CONAFE would continue implementing the above described programs in 1995. Despite&#13;
this year's budget cuts, CONAFE will maintain its targets as in 1994. It will cover about 46,500&#13;
preschool students, 16,000 primary students from community schools, 215,000 students from the&#13;
Solidarity schools and up to 38,400 stipends for community instructors about 25,000 fellowships&#13;
for community school instructors. To guarantee these targets, PROSSE will protect the approved&#13;
1995 and 1996 budgets.&#13;
2.37  CONALITEG is the largest producer of textbooks in Latin America. In contrast to the&#13;
serious deficiency in textbooks in most countries of the region, Mexico, through CONALITEG,&#13;
produces and distributes textbooks in several subjects (mathematics, Spanish, history, science and&#13;
social science) for every primary school student in the country. Textbooks on history and&#13;
geography for each state and a geography atlas for Mexico are also produced. In addition,&#13;
CONALITEG prints and distributes textbooks under contract with other agencies. This includes&#13;
books in more than 24 indigenous languages financed under the First and Second Primary&#13;
Education Projects, and books to accompany the TV secondary education program, which&#13;
benefits children in grades 6-9 in rural areas who have no access to traditional secondary&#13;
education. Approximately 30 percent of all textbooks and teacher guides are printed using&#13;
CONALITEG's own facilities, while 70 percent are contracted out with the private sector. After&#13;
printing, CONALITEG distributes books to about 1,000 warehouses around the country.&#13;
2.38  CONALITEG production for 1994 included a total of 134 million textbooks.  The&#13;
program for 1995 was to print 154 million textbooks for all levels of primary education and for&#13;
preschool as part of the traditional support to basic education. However, with budget reductions&#13;
for 1995, CONALITEG would be able to produce only about 98.7 million textbooks. PROSSE&#13;
would ensure that CONALITEG will produce 98.7 million textbooks in 1995, and achieve the&#13;
1996 target.&#13;
2.39  Despite distribution problems, Mexico has done an admirable job of getting inexpensive&#13;
textbooks into the hands of almost all primary school students in the country. This experience&#13;
indicates the importance of the Government's long-range commitment to textbook provision, and&#13;
is a clear example of a successful experience in overcoming the obstacles associated with a large-&#13;
scale national free textbook program. However, the aging of CONALITEG's production&#13;
facilities combined with the current budget crisis raise questions as to how textbook production&#13;
and distribution could be made more cost-effective in the future in Mexico.  To help&#13;
CONALITEG in finding efficiency gains a Productivity Study will also be financed under&#13;
PROSSE. Terms of reference for this study are included in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.40  CAPFCE is the federal agency charged with managing the constructing, rehabilitating,&#13;
and equipping of educational facilities from preschool through university levels using private&#13;
contractors.  School construction needs are determined by the State Secretariat of Public&#13;
Education in each state and reviewed and consolidated by SEP's General Directorate for&#13;
Planning, Programming and Budgeting at the central level. Up to 1994 it had built some 640,000&#13;
classrooms or about 96,000 schools. In the last six years it constructed the equivalent to 46&#13;
classrooms per day. This agency has extensive experience in carrying out construction under&#13;
IBRD- and IDB-financed projects, including the IBRD's First and Second Primary Education and&#13;
the IDB's PIARE projects and the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation project. While&#13;
the states and municipalities are responsible for primary and some secondary school facilities,&#13;
CAPFCE manages construction of federally-financed facilities at all levels of education, mainly in&#13;
rural, indigenous and marginal urban areas. The four highest priority activities are:&#13;
.  The preschool construction program  has four sub-programs serving urban, rural, and&#13;
indigenous children, including one program of special education for preschool-age students&#13;
with learning disabilities (Centros de Atenci6n Preventiva para la Educaci6n Preescolar).&#13;
*  The general secondary education program comprises facilities for rural youth enrolled in the&#13;
lower secondary education television program (telesecundaria), and facilities for youth&#13;
enrolled in technical training programs. SEP has found that TV secondary education is the&#13;
best cost-effective alternative to deliver secondary education services in rural isolated areas&#13;
where given the small size of the students, it would be very costly to establish regular&#13;
secondary schools. In 1993, the unit cost for TV secondary was about 10 percent lower than&#13;
general secondary (N$858 versus N$935 in 1988 constant prices). TV secondary schools are&#13;
one-room schools with instructional material delivered to schools by SEP through television.&#13;
Despite the low student teacher ratio, the low unit cost is explained by the fact that one&#13;
teacher covers all subjects. Currently 5,800 telesecundaria schools operate with about 16,000&#13;
teachers and 261,000 students. The schools often start in rented or borrowed premises and&#13;
once established, move to permanent premises with the necessary laboratory and sanitary&#13;
facilities.&#13;
*  Boarding schools (albergues) for indigenous students in isolated rural areas.&#13;
*  The maintenance program provides preventive maintenance mainly for school buildings in&#13;
basic education. The technical manual for preventive maintenance is the same one used by the&#13;
First and Second Primary Education Projects financed by the IBRD and PIARE financed by&#13;
the IDB.&#13;
2.41   CAPFCE had to reduce by 11 percent the 1995 original targets as a result of the budget&#13;
cuts. The physical programs that would be protected by PROSSE include those which benefit the&#13;
most educationally deprived students. PROSSE will protect CAPFCE's budget to ensure that&#13;
these students, generally from poor and rural areas, will benefit from the 1995 and 1996&#13;
construction programs; whose intention is to consolidate and house existing telesecundaria&#13;
schools in permanent premises. In 1995, the revised program includes the construction of 5,990&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
educational spaces for preschool, 1,990 for TV secondary and 40 for indigenous boarding&#13;
schools.&#13;
Health&#13;
2.42  In the health sector, further cuts in expenditure on essential health services for the poor,&#13;
who rely upon the SSA, could widen the existing large disparities in health status between&#13;
geographic regions and income groups. Already life expectancy stands at 55 years in rural areas,&#13;
versus 71 years in urban areas; and 53 years among the poor, as compared to 73 years among the&#13;
wealthy. Similarly, infant mortality ranges from 20 per 1,000 in richer states to more than 50 per&#13;
1,000 in the poorer southern states. The budget for cost-effective preventive and curative&#13;
interventions targeted to the poor needs to be protected to prevent an exacerbation of these&#13;
disparities.&#13;
2.43   Moreover, there is an unfinished agenda, as still some 33 million people live in poverty&#13;
without adequate access to health and social services. Of a total population of 84 million, 25&#13;
percent (21 million) are poor and another 16 percent (13 million) are considered extremely poor,&#13;
not able to meet their basic health needs. Real per capita income in the richer (mainly northern)&#13;
states is more than twice that in the poorer (mainly southern) states. Urban centers and northern&#13;
states have health indicators similar to OECD levels, while in urban slums, rural areas and&#13;
southern states the poor are still subject to a pre-transitional epidemiological pattern,&#13;
characterized by communicable diseases and malnutrition. The urban elites and the middle class&#13;
are increasingly subject to a post-transitional epidemiological pattern with a higher burden of&#13;
chronic diseases. These disparities place very different kinds of demands on the health services&#13;
and represent a major challenge for the Mexican health care system.&#13;
2.44   Sector work undertaken by the GOM and the two Banks in 1994 shows that after 1988&#13;
the Government increasingly made health care a priority in its agenda. As a result, total federal&#13;
health spending increased nearly 15 percent per year in real terms and reached an estimated 4.8&#13;
percent of GDP in 1994. Overall, IMSS and ISSSTE account for 75 percent of federal health&#13;
expenditure, the SSA for 20 percent, and the Armed Forces and other parastatal entities, such as&#13;
the Mexican State Oil Company (Petroleos Mexicanos: PEMEX), account for the remaining 5&#13;
percent. However, spending increases have not been equitably distributed between the main&#13;
providers, favoring higher and middle income classes who are covered by the public social&#13;
security system. Fiscal transfers to IMSS account for some 0.5 percent of GDP, which is&#13;
equivalent to the total SSA expenditures for the uninsured population. In other words, those&#13;
middle and higher income population receive the same public subsidies as the uninsured low&#13;
income population. Between 1987 and 1993, the budgets of the Mexican Social Security Institute&#13;
(Instituto Mexicano de Seguridad Social: IMSS) increased 80 percent, the Public Sector&#13;
Employees Social Security Institute (Instituto de Servicios de Seguridad Social para&#13;
Trabajadores Estatales: ISSSTE) 23 percent, and the SSA 44 percent, widening the gap in&#13;
public services between those already being covered by the social security system of IMSS and&#13;
those not covered and attended to by SSA services. Moreover, although spending increased in&#13;
the SSA, a disproportionate share of these resources are allocated to salaries and administrative&#13;
costs, leaving the efficiency in public health services provided by SSA further deteriorated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Despite the increases in spending by the SSA and the social security institutes, the decline in&#13;
quality of public services and increases in income levels have led to a rapid increase in private&#13;
sector spending, which now accounts for 2 percent of GDP, or an estimated US$84 per capita.&#13;
2.45  Within the health sector, the PROSSE aims to support the following efficiency gains&#13;
within the operation of the SSA:&#13;
(a)   Targeting of SSA. The current economic recession will increase the importance of&#13;
the SSA's health services as service provider of last resort. Many employees,&#13;
estimated up to 1 million, will lose their formal sector jobs and will, over the&#13;
course of 1995 and 1996, augment the uninsured population dependent on services&#13;
from the SSA as health provider of last resort. The budgetary protection will help&#13;
the SSA to effectively use its installed capacity to provide more services for a&#13;
greater number of patients, and thereby raise efficiency.&#13;
(b)   Selection of preventive and basic health care programs. The PROSSE intends&#13;
to protect highly cost-effective preventive programs and priority basic health&#13;
interventions from budget cuts as identified by the Fundacion Mexicana de Salud&#13;
as the initial proposal for the basic health care package. Thus cuts in the sector&#13;
would be concentrated on less cost-effective tertiary curative care and the 10&#13;
national health institutes.  This segment of SSA  operations will have to&#13;
accommodate to a tighter budget and find additional resources through internal&#13;
efficiency gains, competition for budgets or by charging patients for sophisticated&#13;
third level care services.&#13;
(c)    Budget regularization.  Certain priority programs, such as the immunization&#13;
program or the cholera prevention program, are financed through savings under&#13;
the budgetary allocations for other programs. The proposed program intends to&#13;
not only protect the operation of those priority programs but also to regularize&#13;
budget allocations to them and include them into the annual budget process.&#13;
(d)   Competition for resources. The proposed program would introduce an element&#13;
of competition for budgetary support in 1996. Programs which will not achieve&#13;
their programmed objectives are at risk of not receiving of the protection program&#13;
in its second year in favor of other more efficient and effective programs.&#13;
(e)   Inter-state equity.  Currently, the poorer states receive a lower budgetary&#13;
allocation per uninsured population than the richer states. A more rational and&#13;
equitable allocation system for the SSA budget will be developed and introduced&#13;
under PROSSE.&#13;
Employment&#13;
2.46 Mexico's financial crisis has already had an impact on unemployment. The formal sector&#13;
of the economy is beset by three major problems: (a) a generalized reduction in domestic demand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
caused by the recession, although the tradables sectors will benefit from an increased external&#13;
demand as a result of the devaluation; (b) high interest rates (analysis of companies quoted on the&#13;
Mexican stock exchange shows that companies in the transport, construction and non-financial&#13;
service sectors have particularly high levels of indebtedness); and (c) the impact of the devaluation&#13;
of the peso for those companies holding debt denominated in foreign exchange (sectors&#13;
particularly affected are transport, non-financial services and, within manufacturing, cement,&#13;
machinery, transport equipment, textiles and clothing).&#13;
2.47 Under these circumstances, enterprises in the formal sector have started to shed labor to&#13;
reduce costs and improve their short-term cash flow and there is no evidence that this trend will&#13;
be reversed in the near future. Evidence of the decrease in demand for labor is as follows:&#13;
*  Between November 1994 and January 1995, according to IMSS statistics, 231,000 workers&#13;
(2.6 percent of total employment) lost their jobs in the formal sector (according to INEGI,&#13;
some 753,000 workers lost their jobs in the first two months of 1995). Of these job losses, 36&#13;
percent were in manufacturing, 18 percent in commerce, 11 percent in services and 11 percent&#13;
in construction. It is expected that another 800,000 workers will lose their jobs by the end of&#13;
the year.&#13;
3 Open unemployment rose to 5.3 percent in February 1995 -- its highest level since 1987.&#13;
* According to the Encuesta Industrial Mensual, there was a contraction in employment in the&#13;
3,218 largest manufacturing enterprises of 5 percent in 1994, concentrated in industries&#13;
producing intermediate goods and consumer durables.&#13;
- There was a 23 percent drop in the number of vacancies listed through the employment&#13;
service in Mexico City in February 1995 compared to a year ago.&#13;
- Several major banks are in the process of laying off up to 30 percent of their staff.&#13;
* The Federal Government is in the process of establishing downsizing targets for administrative&#13;
staff, as well as implementing a general austerity program, in line with the latest round of&#13;
budget cuts.&#13;
* It is estimated that 2,000 restaurants and eating establishments closed during the first quarter&#13;
of 1995, with a loss of some 14,000 jobs.&#13;
2.48   Set against the context of the need for the labor market to absorb approximately I million&#13;
new entrants annually, the employment position in Mexico appears bleak. Open unemployment is&#13;
not a viable option for most workers4 - as most workers in the formal sector are not entitled to&#13;
severance pay, and there are no continuing forms of income support or unemployment insurance.&#13;
4Despite these developments, open unemployment increased only from 3.3 % to 3.7 % between the fourth quarter of 1993 and&#13;
the same quarter of 1994. However, by February 1995, open unemployment had risen to 5.3 % nationally and as high as&#13;
10.7% in Mexico City.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Workers becoming unemployed thus either seek alternative employment in the formal sector or,&#13;
particularly in times of recession, swell the ranks of the informal sector, increasing the number of&#13;
under-employed and placing further downward pressure on real incomes in the informal sector.&#13;
2.49  Whilst it is expected that the devaluation will have a positive impact on demand in the&#13;
tradables sectors (both for exports in such sectors as automobiles, transport equipment,&#13;
machinery, extractive industries and metal products) and should boost the flow of tourists, the&#13;
impact on demand in the labor market will take some months to be realized. In this context, there&#13;
is a need for two types of shorter term interventions to bolster demand in the labor market: (i)&#13;
retraining programs for the unemployed to help them take advantage of new employment&#13;
opportunities in growing sectors and self-employment; and (ii) short term employment programs&#13;
through the rehabilitation and creation of physical infrastructure targeted to the rural and poor&#13;
areas.&#13;
Nutrition&#13;
2.50  In 1988 approximately 42 percent of all children under 5 years of age in Mexico were&#13;
malnourished. This level is not likely to have improved since 1988, mainly because malnutrition in&#13;
Mexico is a function of poverty, infectious disease and poor feeding practices (including&#13;
breastfeeding). Malnutrition is concentrated among the poorest households (defined as less than 2&#13;
minimum salaries) and in isolated, largely indigenous, rural municipalities. Although general food&#13;
subsidies have been the most widespread and the most costly food program, the Mexican&#13;
Government has implemented a series of targeted food and nutrition interventions to provide&#13;
income transfers and other services to the poor and those who are nutritionally at risk. The&#13;
targeted interventions can be classified into four categories, namely supply and price regulation&#13;
programs, price subsidy programs, food distribution programs and nutrition education and&#13;
consumer information programs.&#13;
2.51   While Mexico has historically devoted large budgetary resources for food and nutrition&#13;
programs, malnutrition has not been eliminated. There are currently over two dozen nutrition&#13;
programs and food subsidies in operation in Mexico, which in 1995 will cost well over US$500&#13;
million. These are designed to help the poor covered by all food and nutrition programs&#13;
(estimated to be approximately 16 million people or about 2.7 million families).&#13;
2.52   The main problems with the existing nutrition programs are that they fail to reach those at&#13;
highest risk of malnutrition (especially in rural areas) and that there is no coordination or&#13;
coherence among programs with respect to goals, targeting criteria, monitoring systems, or&#13;
delivery systems. The budget for such programs is highly concentrated in urban areas, where&#13;
programs overlap in coverage, and whilst in the highest risk rural areas there is a lack of coverage.&#13;
Many of the national programs distribute food but the food basket delivered is highly variable&#13;
with respect to commodities, nutritional value, and cost. An additional concern is that none of the&#13;
programs in place at present are addressing micronutrient deficiencies: for example, iodine&#13;
deficiency continues to be a problem in mountainous areas, and iron deficiency is widespread&#13;
particularly among the poor. The current expenditures on food and nutrition are not cost-efficient&#13;
or effective in overcoming malnutrition. The GOM recognizes that many of the reforms necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
in the nutrition sector require further study and the GOM is seeking additional program support&#13;
from the Banks in the field of food and nutrition.&#13;
2.53   To improve the effectiveness of nutrition programs in rural areas, in 1991 the GOM&#13;
implemented a pilot Integrated Nutrition Health Program, financed by SEDESOL and SSA, with&#13;
IBRD (under loan 3357-ME) and IDB support, in the poorest regions of three states. This&#13;
intervention included growth monitoring, nutrition education, kitchen gardens, community public&#13;
works, and a food basket delivered monthly to families with malnourished children. The project&#13;
was carried out by community volunteers operating under the aegis of SEDESOL and the state&#13;
Secretariat of Health. An evaluation found that the program was highly cost-effective: the per&#13;
capita cost of the project was US$20 per beneficiary (including all family members in the targeted&#13;
household) or US$85 per vulnerable individual (pregnant and lactating women and children under&#13;
5). In the more malnourished community the rate of moderate and severe malnutrition fell from&#13;
18.5 percent to 5.1 percent; in the other community the rate fell from 8.7 percent to 8.2 percent.&#13;
The "scaling up" of the pilot nutrition, food and health program, with the modifications suggested&#13;
by the evaluation, in these nine states will be supported by SEDESOL under PROSSE(para.&#13;
3.20). The priority states, high risk regions and municipalities were selected through the following&#13;
criteria: (a) CONAPO Poverty Index;5 (b) national census of growth monitory (children less than&#13;
five years of age, 1994); (c) health indicators; (d) national food consumption data; and (e)&#13;
health/nutrition indicators of specific nutrition deficiency studies done in Oaxaca, Puebla, Hidalgo&#13;
and parts of Veracruz.&#13;
E. Lessons Learned from Past Operations&#13;
2.54   Many lessons have been leamt from a wide range of social sector projects which have&#13;
been undertaken in Mexico. The relevant projects are summarized in Table 4.&#13;
5 The CONAPO poverty index ranks states, jurisdictions and municipalities based on results of "principal&#13;
components analysis", using the 1990 INEGI census, which takes the following variables into account: (a)&#13;
population density; (b) illiteracy in population &gt;15 years; (c) population &gt;15 years without primary schooling;&#13;
(d) sanitation; (e) percentage of households without electricity; (f) drinking water; (g) percentage of&#13;
overcrowded households; (h) percentage of households with dirt floor; (i) percentage of population in localities&#13;
of fewer than 5000 inhabitants; (j) per capita income of less than two minimum salaries; and (k) presence of&#13;
indigenous population. The national average would receive the index "0". A composite index between 0 and&#13;
I would be considered as "high", between I and 2 as "very high". A negative index (below 0) would indicate a&#13;
better than national average poverty situation ("low") and would not be considered for the project.&#13;

2.55 The relevant lessons which have been incorporated into PROSSE are as follows:&#13;
Education&#13;
2.56 Education Quality and Non-personnel Expenditures. The channeling of resources to&#13;
non-personnel costs has been instrumental in improving the quality of primary education in&#13;
targeted areas. Access to textbooks has been one of the most cost effective education inputs to&#13;
increase students' academic performance. There is vast empirical evidence, including studies&#13;
financed by the First Primary Education (IBRD) and PIARE (IDB)  Projects, indicating that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
textbooks improve student knowledge of science, mathematics and language. PROSSE builds&#13;
upon this experience by financing textbooks, infrastructure and other educational materials in rural&#13;
areas. PROSSE would expand the coverage of CONAFE programs by financing teacher stipends,&#13;
for volunteers in single teacher school who could not otherwise be appointed, leaving small&#13;
communities without teachers, and thus without schools.  CAPFCE would finance the&#13;
consolidation of existing schools, improve the quality of schooling and widen the range of&#13;
subjects so that existing teachers provide effective education.&#13;
2.57  Access to Basic Education in Rural Areas. Low access in rural areas is due in part by&#13;
the poor living standards of the family, and by the lack of adequate schooling system and&#13;
infrastructure. SEP regular services are not provided in many small rural communities, but a low&#13;
cost alternative education modality, with strong community participation, have been successfully&#13;
developed by CONAFE.&#13;
2.58  Targeting.  The most effective way to reach the economically and educationally&#13;
disadvantaged is by specifically targeting the poor. Both CONAFE and CAPFCE focus most.&#13;
project activities to the poorest areas of the country thereby serving small communities selected&#13;
for their low socio-economic status (utilizing the CONAPO index).&#13;
Health&#13;
2.59  The ongoing IBRD financed First Basic Health Project was the first IBRD experience with.&#13;
a health related project in Mexico and provided the most valuable source for lessons learned to&#13;
consider for the proposed program. Accordingly, the critical evaluation of the implementation&#13;
experience of this project helped to transfer positive lessons into the design of the proposed&#13;
program. Positive features that are critical for the SSA to accomplish its mandate to provide&#13;
health benefits for the uninsured population are:&#13;
2.60 Targeting. While the First Basic Health Project targeted poor states, resources often did&#13;
not reach populations most in need within the state. Therefore, it is necessary to target delivery of'&#13;
a cost-effective basic health care package to the most disadvantaged municipalities within a poor&#13;
state. This is the approach being followed under PROSSE.&#13;
2.61  Improve Access to Basic Health Care. The First Basic Health Project supported&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation of first level health centers and second level hospitals in order to&#13;
provide an environment suitable for basic services of high quality for the uninsured. It has been&#13;
demonstrated that the use factor of rehabilitated facilities increased significantly. PROSSE will&#13;
continue to finance the rehabilitation of the first and second level care network to provide quality&#13;
services to the uninsured.&#13;
2.62  Rural Staffing. Basic Health I supported the training and recruitment of community&#13;
health care workers which are selected by the community where they will serve. They were&#13;
utilized in the project for staffing health posts in communities where no medical doctor was.&#13;
available. The PROSSE will build on this experience and finance training for community health.&#13;
workers to serve remote communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
2.63  Build Ownership in the States. Basic Health I featured institution building activities by&#13;
supporting local decision-making and problem solving, decentralizing procurement of essential&#13;
supplies and improving the management capacity and the management information systems at the&#13;
local level. PROSSE will continue to support project states in procurement and implementation&#13;
matters through the health sub-program.&#13;
Employment&#13;
2.64 Positive Impact of Training Programs and the Need for Targeting. The IBRD's&#13;
experience with both pre-service and in-service training has demonstrated their positive impact&#13;
both in increasing the earnings profile of trainees and meeting the needs of private and public&#13;
sector skilled employees. Careful use of the selection criteria agreed under the Labor Market and&#13;
Productivity Enhancement Project (Loan 3542-ME, FY93) will be continued under PROSSE for&#13;
the regular PROBECAT programs will be continued but modified as necessary in relation to para.&#13;
2.68. However, these trainees with lesser educational attainments and work experience would be&#13;
able to participate in the on-the-job training modality (Annex 4).&#13;
2.65  Public and Private Sector Linkages. Experience has shown that close collaboration is&#13;
required between publicly funded training institutions and the private sector to ensure that course&#13;
content and graduate output match employers' needs and hence employment opportunities&#13;
available. PROSSE will promote a stronger linkage between public and private sector for the&#13;
regular PROBECAT program.&#13;
2.66 Flexibility and Adaptability. The economic crisis in Mexico has focused attention on&#13;
the need to shift training and education programs away from rigid courses with a low probability&#13;
of directly related employment in the formal sector thereafter. PROSSE responds to this by&#13;
supporting combined basic skills and direct employment in rehabilitation programs.&#13;
2.67 Unemployment versus Underemployment. Experience in Mexico has shown that open&#13;
unemployment is the tip of the iceberg. A more serious problem is underemployment, with the&#13;
need being to increase the productivity of employees. Under PROSSE, PROBECAT will be&#13;
opened up to the underemployed in both the formal and informal sector to acquire skills, enhance&#13;
their productivity an obtain more secure employment.&#13;
Nutrition&#13;
2.68  Overall Program Design: The evaluation of the pilot nutrition-project conducted under&#13;
the IBRD's Second Agricultural Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3357-ME, AGSAL II, FY91),&#13;
co-financed by the IDB, found that: (a) measurable results should not be expected before two&#13;
years of program implementation; (b) the program should be targeted to the places with the&#13;
highest rates of malnutrition; (c) the food basket should contain no more than a few commodities&#13;
and yet address micronutrient deficiencies; (d) implementing agencies at the state level and&#13;
community levels should be clearly defined; (e) the nutrition education, including growth&#13;
monitoring, needs careful design and integration with the rest of the intervention package; and (f)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
the community volunteers need close supervision and monitoring. These lessons have been&#13;
incorporated into the integrated nutrition sub-program to be supported under PROSSE, which&#13;
will be closely monitored and objectively evaluated.&#13;
2.69  Targeting.  The evaluation of the pilot nutrition project under the AGSAL II confirms&#13;
that a well-targeted and executed nutrition program can have a substantially positive effect on the&#13;
nutrition and health status of vulnerable population groups. PROSSE will expand this positive&#13;
experience in rural areas of the poorest states of Mexico.&#13;
2.70  Distribution of Micro-nutrients. Experience in El Salvador, Guatemala, and the&#13;
Dominican Republic suggests that fortified baked products can be highly cost-effective in&#13;
addressing micronutrient deficiencies in school children in whom such deficiencies cause learning&#13;
problems. Therefore, in addition to the basic food and nutrition package, PROSSE will finance&#13;
pilot testing of a vitamin and mineral-enriched cookie in the school breakfast so as to better&#13;
address micronutrient deficiencies in school-aged children (whilst this does not represent a safety&#13;
net measure it addresses an important long-term nutritional goal).&#13;
2.71   Distribution System. The distribution of food to the targeted population groups requires&#13;
a well established distribution system and executing agency capable of organizing the beneficiaries&#13;
to participate in the logistics of food distribution. PROSSE will utilize existing public or private&#13;
networks to provide these services and, in addition, will expand it through the health services&#13;
network. PROSSE will also use the network of facilities of the National Indigenous Institute in&#13;
the most remote rural areas amongst indigenous populations.&#13;
2.72  Nutrition Education: The literature on food supplementation programs suggests that&#13;
any food transfer should be accompanied by nutrition education and growth monitoring to effect&#13;
behavioral change in the family and to communicate to the family about the increased nutritional&#13;
needs of pregnant and lactating women and preschool children.  The costs of this program are&#13;
modest compared to food supplementation programs in other countries.&#13;
F. Rationale for the Banks' Involvement&#13;
2.73  The proposed loan is consistent with the IBRD's CAS which will be discussed by the&#13;
Board on June 15, 1995 and the IDB's Country Programming Paper (CPP), to be discussed with&#13;
the GOM later this year. The strategy focuses on the revival of growth, poverty reduction and&#13;
human resources development, and environmental sustainability. The proposed loan is critical to&#13;
the IBRD's CAS and the IDB's CPP over both the short and longer term. The loan is one of the&#13;
six operations proposed by both Banks to respond to Mexico's current financial crisis. It provides&#13;
a safety net to the most vulnerable groups affected by the crisis and helps maintain the gains&#13;
achieved in social indicators in recent years. Over the longer term, this program will continue the&#13;
work of both Banks in poverty reduction and human resource development, which remain key to&#13;
achieving growth, equity and sustainable development in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
2.74  The IBRD and the IDB are the major institutions that have financed social sector&#13;
investment in recent years and are the only institutions which can provide the magnitude of the&#13;
external financial resources to support essential social service programs in Mexico during its&#13;
current fiscal difficulties. The Banks have built up an in-depth knowledge of the social sectors in&#13;
Mexico through their extensive operations and sector work. The Banks' experience in supporting&#13;
project activities in the social sectors provides the foundation for program improvements which,&#13;
although limited due to the short duration of this program, are supported under PROSSE.&#13;
Moreover, the experience gained in project implementation by the executing agencies with the&#13;
Banks' policies and procedures will facilitate the rapid disbursement of the loan funds, which is&#13;
essential for purposes of the overall macroeconomic stabilization program.&#13;
3. THE PROGRAM&#13;
A. Program Objectives&#13;
3.1   The PROSSE has three objectives, to: (a) protect essential social services for the poor,&#13;
through the provision of textbooks to all students, and on a targeted basis, teaching materials,&#13;
maintaining access to pre-school, primary and lower secondary education in isolated rural areas, a&#13;
basic health care package, vaccines, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and community health&#13;
outreach campaigns; (b) strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion the poor&#13;
from the effects of the economic crisis through retraining, the creation of short term employment&#13;
opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed, and a nutrition program targeted to&#13;
vulnerable groups in the poorest areas; and (c) lay the foundation for measuring and&#13;
implementing efficiency gains in the social sectors over the medium term through technical&#13;
assistance and program monitoring.&#13;
B. Program Description&#13;
3.2   The PROSSE has been designed as a time slice operation to finance ongoing high priority&#13;
social sector programs within the existing budgetary allocations. It consists of five sub-programs:&#13;
(a) basic education services; (b) basic health services; (c) retraining and employment&#13;
generation; (d) food and nutrition programs for vulnerable groups; and (e) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of social sector programs. In each sub-program, the GOM will seek to improve the&#13;
efficiency of public expenditure, within the constraints of the two-year implementation period,&#13;
using agreed monitoring and evaluation indicators. Each of these sub-programs is summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
(1) Sub-Program 1: Basic Education Services&#13;
3.3   The basic education services sub-program  (total cost US$593.5 million), to be&#13;
implemented by SEP through dependent agencies, would support the Government's strategy to&#13;
improve equity in access and to raise quality of basic education. The program would obtain this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
by increasing access to preschool, primary, and lower secondary education for the poor and the&#13;
rural and indigenous children living in the most deprived and remote areas in the country; and by&#13;
supporting two of the most important factors related to low quality of education, adequate&#13;
physical facilities and access to textbook in the classroom. The program would do this by&#13;
providing budget support for the three federal programs described below.&#13;
3.4   Basic Education for the Rural Poor (US$132.4 million or 6.6 percent of total costs),&#13;
to provide schooling to rural isolated preschool- and primary education-aged children by&#13;
supporting CONAFE's programs. The program would benefit 46,500 rural community preschool&#13;
students; 161,000 rural community primary school students; and provide up to 21,000 stipends&#13;
for former community instructors; up to 38,400 stipends for community instructors; up to 14,600&#13;
stipends for transportation or boarding, mainly for lower secondary education students; and about&#13;
215,000 Solidarity School students. These expenditures financed by the IDB loan will enable&#13;
single teacher schools to remain open continuously.&#13;
3.5   Textbooks for Basic Education (US$161.5 million or 8.1 percent of total costs), to&#13;
provide 91.5 million textbooks for primary education students in the country and 7 million teacher&#13;
guides (32 different topics) through financing of CONALITEG in 1995, and at least the same&#13;
quantities in 1996; and to support a productivity study of the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
CONALITEG's existing production and distribution system. The agreed terms of reference are&#13;
included in Annex 3. During negotiations, the GOM confirmed that it would review the results&#13;
of the CONALITEG productivity study and present an action plan to the Banks by July 31,&#13;
1 996 (para. 7.1 (c)).&#13;
3.6   Improvement and Expansion of Educational Facilities (US$299.6 million or 15.0&#13;
percent of total costs), to support CAPFCE's 1995 program regarding: (a) construction of 5,990&#13;
educational spaces, including classrooms and support facilities, for preschool serving rural and&#13;
indigenous children and children in urban marginal areas; (b) construction and equipping an&#13;
estimated 3,720 educational spaces, including classrooms, workshops, store rooms, sanitary&#13;
facilities, and support facilities, for TV secondary schools; and (c) construction of 40 educational&#13;
spaces for Indigenous Boarding Schools. The construction referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above is&#13;
entirely for the replacement or extension of inadequate schools or the replacement of rented&#13;
premises with purpose built structures. No new schools will be established under this sub-&#13;
program. CAPFCE program administration, infrastructure for training, building maintenance, and&#13;
constructing and equipping technical secondary facilities will be financed by the IDB loan.&#13;
(2) Sub-Program 2: Basic Health Services&#13;
3.7   The Basic Health Services Sub-program  (total cost US$746.5 million) to be&#13;
implemented by the SSA, would benefit the 33 million uninsured population through the following&#13;
activities.&#13;
3.8   Priority Preventive Programs, (US$307.9 million or 15.4 percent of total costs) which&#13;
are cost effective public health interventions, by: (i) immunizing 20 million children annually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
against the most common preventable diseases; (ii) control and treatment of endemic and&#13;
communicable diseases; (iii) screening for early detection of diabetes, and other chronic diseases,&#13;
involving over 4 million patients annually; (iv) family planning and reproductive health for about&#13;
2.5 million new users per year; (v) maternal and child health, pre-and postnatal care, benefiting&#13;
about 9 million individual patients annually; and (vi) health and nutrition education and social&#13;
marketing of public health programs.&#13;
3.9   Basic Curative Health Care, (US$335.7 million or 16.8 percent of total costs) for the&#13;
33 million uninsured population, would be delivered through the basic health care and mobile&#13;
outreach units.&#13;
3.10  Basic Health Infrastructure, (US$102.9 million or 5.1 percent of total costs) civil&#13;
works, equipment and maintenance for first and second level health facilities and public health&#13;
laboratories scheduled to be initiated in 1995 and concluded by the end of 1996 would be&#13;
undertaken by   Infrastructure Division of the SSA  (Coordinaci6n General de Obra,&#13;
Conservacion yEquipamiento;CGOCE).&#13;
3.11  To implement the above actions, PROSSE would finance: the civil works program; the&#13;
acquisition, storage and distribution of vaccines, essential drugs, medical supplies and basic&#13;
equipment to the first and second level care network (i.e. health posts, health centers,&#13;
jurisdictional centers and second level hospitals); community outreach and per diem and travel for&#13;
supervision personnel and on a declining basis.&#13;
(3) Sub-program 3: Retraining and Employment Generation&#13;
3.12  The employment sub-program (total cost US$644.2 million) includes two elements: (i)&#13;
retraining and stipends for 350,000 unemployed and underemployed workers in 1995 and 450,000&#13;
in 1996 through PROBECAT, managed by STPS, to enhance worker productivity and&#13;
employment prospects (see para. 2.20); and (ii) short-term employment generation through&#13;
infrastructure development in low income urban and rural areas through the PESE (see para.&#13;
2.22).&#13;
3.13  Retraining for the Unemployed - PROBECAT - (US$225.9 million or 11.3 percent of&#13;
total costs). At least 150,000 of the trainees each year would benefit from a new training&#13;
modality under PROBECAT, receiving basic skills on-the-job training in areas such as plumbing,&#13;
electricity, brick-laying plus a stipend to work in rehabilitation and public works programs in low&#13;
income areas or whilst training to establish their own small businesses. The remaining trainees&#13;
would follow the more traditional PROBECAT modality of training center and in-plant training.&#13;
The average stipend would be for three months set at the level of 1 minimum wage (currently&#13;
ranging N$15 to 18 per day) plus a small transport allowance. About 30 percent of the stipends&#13;
would go to rural beneficiaries. These stipends represent an investment in the human capital of the&#13;
individuals concerned, financing the opportunity cost of the training time, acting as an incentive&#13;
for enhancing skills and, as a by-product, providing social support to the families of these low-&#13;
income targeted trainees. They would be financed by the loans on a declining basis. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
effectiveness of both the ongoing and new PROBECAT modalities will be evaluated through the&#13;
ongoing evaluation program under the Labor Market and Productivity Enhancement Project&#13;
(Loan 3542-ME).  The selection criteria for the different modalities under PROBECAT,&#13;
distribution of beneficiaries by state (as of April 28, 1995) and detailed responsibilities for the on-&#13;
the-job training modality are attached in Annex 4.&#13;
3.14  PROSSE would finance the cost of training, stipends and up to 10,000 tool-kits required&#13;
for the on-the-job training modality. The cost of materials for the rehabilitation would be financed&#13;
by the beneficiaries. Though the staff assigned for this task will be located within the offices of&#13;
the State Employment Services (SEEs) and use their physical infrastructure, the program of&#13;
stipends will be financed completely by the federal budget and the loans. In addition to the 99&#13;
SEE offices, the SEEs will use the 51 mobile units purchased under the Labor Market and&#13;
Productivity Enhancement Project (Ln. 3542-ME, FY93) for expanding the coverage to the&#13;
unemployed and underemployed in small urban and rural areas.&#13;
3.15 Short-term Employment Program - PESE - (US$418.3 million or 20.9 percent of total&#13;
costs). The GOM will carefully ensure that the paid labor approach under the PESE will not&#13;
undermine the longer-term community participation approaches under PRONASOL. This will be&#13;
achieved in two ways: (a) through making it clear that the paid employment activities are time-&#13;
bound; and (b) by funding only certain categories of sub-projects which have a high public goods&#13;
element.&#13;
3.16  The budgetary allocation for the PESE will come from the states' Social Development&#13;
Agreements (i.e. federal funds allocated to each of the nation's 31 states for social development&#13;
programs under PRONASOL). The PESE will be coordinated through SEDESOL utilizing the&#13;
existing administrative and financial mechanisms established under the FSM (para. 2.22). In&#13;
1995, N$1.2 billion (approximately US$200.0 million) has been allocated to rural areas with a&#13;
high poverty rate and indigenous population together with N$500.0 million (US$83.0 million) for&#13;
urban areas with serious unemployment and poverty problems. It is anticipated that the rural&#13;
component would extend beyond 1995, whilst a decision on the urban component would be taken&#13;
in the light of developments in the urban labor market during 1995. PROSSE will fund the costs&#13;
of the PESE in all these states not already covered under the IBRD supported Second&#13;
Decentralization &amp; Regional Development project (Loan 3357-ME).6 However, in these 8 states,&#13;
PROSSE will finance PESE in the large urban municipios not covered under Loan 3357-ME and&#13;
may finance categories of sub-projects not eligible for financing under this Loan.&#13;
3.17  Eligible labor intensive activities under the PESE include construction and maintenance of&#13;
rural roads, spot road improvements, cleaning of drainage canals, garbage removal, reforestation,&#13;
and conservation programs for soil and water. The state and municipal governments will discuss&#13;
and approve specific programs in which to invest the funds. In rural areas, each community,&#13;
through the respective Municipal Council, will be directly responsible for selecting an investment&#13;
program. Selection of beneficiaries will be self-targeting through the low compensation (only 80&#13;
percent of the minimum wage) for the heavy manual work involved. PROBECAT would be able&#13;
6 / The States included under the Second Decentralization &amp;Regional Development Project are Chiapas, Guerrero,&#13;
Hidalgo, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz and Zacatecas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
to train skilled laborers necessary to complement unskilled laborers for the public works&#13;
undertaken (para. 3.13). During negotiations agreements were confirmed that the GOM would&#13;
execute the PESE through SEDESOL according to the agreed operational modalities (para&#13;
7.1(d)).&#13;
(4) Sub-program 4: Nutrition&#13;
3.18  With respect to key social safety net schemes, the GOM expects a markedly increased&#13;
demand due to the economic crisis. Therefore, it is seeking external support for only those&#13;
priority nutrition programs which are cost-effective and well targeted to the vulnerable&#13;
population groups, such as young children, pregnant and lactating women, in the poorest states.&#13;
3.19  The integrated nutrition sub-program (total cost US$8.7 million) would be based on&#13;
nutrition and health interventions to improve the nutrition status of the vulnerable groups. The&#13;
program would provide a package of interventions for poor rural families with vulnerable groups&#13;
(children under age 5, pregnant and lactating women) consisting of: (a) the distribution of a basic&#13;
food supplement basket (containing maize flour, beans, salt, sugar and vegetable oil); (b)&#13;
micronutrient supplementation; (c) growth monitoring; and (d) health and nutrition education.&#13;
Micronutrient supplements would include: (i)  iodized salt because of widespread iodine&#13;
deficiency in the highest risk areas; and (ii) iron tablets along with supportive counseling to&#13;
pregnant women, and operations research to find better means of encouraging pregnant women to&#13;
take iron pills. The community would participate in the program by assisting in the food&#13;
distribution process and developing complementary activities, such as construction of latrines,&#13;
improvement in water supply and housing, and establishment of vegetable gardens. A simplified&#13;
set of indicators has been selected to monitor both the delivery of inputs and impact on the&#13;
beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will be strictly monitored to ensure compliance with the targeting&#13;
objectives of the food supplements. This will be reviewed by the Banks quarterly (para. 5.5).&#13;
3.20 At the central level, the SSA, SEDESOL and DIF (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia -&#13;
Integrated Family Development) would be the apex organizations which would devolve to the&#13;
state and municipal governments the implementation of the program. At the state level, in the&#13;
case of Hidalgo, the operational responsibility would rest with state government under the&#13;
coordination of the SSA. Beginning in 1995, Hidalgo state will begin to implement the&#13;
consolidated nutrition program in the highest risk municipalities. The state of Hidalgo was&#13;
selected as a model for this sub-program of the PROSSE, because it is in a more advanced&#13;
planning stage, and the state has already established the necessary agreements with the federal&#13;
agencies to coordinate the nutrition interventions, thereby improving efficiency. Similar programs&#13;
would be extended to the other of priority states (such as Puebla, Oaxaca and Guerrero) in 1996&#13;
under the coordination of SEDESOL and DIF. The nutrition program supported by PROSSE&#13;
amounts to an investment of US$20 per beneficiary per year.&#13;
3.21  Initially, the food would be procured by the executing agencies through the National&#13;
Distributing Company (DICONSA) and then to be transferred to SEDESOL in 1995. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
to expand the programs in 1996, SEDESOL would review the mechanisms of provision,&#13;
transportation and storage of food baskets to reach the remote targeted areas.&#13;
(5) Sub-Program 5: Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.22 The Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-Program (US$2.1 million or 0.1 percent of total&#13;
costs) will strengthen the capacity of SHCP to measure and monitor and evaluate the outputs of&#13;
social sector expenditures, thereby providing the foundation for a system to increase efficiency in&#13;
expenditures throughout the social sectors over the medium term. The IBRD loan will finance&#13;
technical assistance to establish such a system, and the costs of a program of physical audits and&#13;
beneficiary assessments within the social sectors.&#13;
3.23  The initial stage in this process is to establish a reliable set of monitoring indicators which&#13;
relate outputs (services delivered) and outcomes (improvements in welfare by beneficiaries) to a&#13;
common input (actual expenditures). Unfortunately, many implementing agencies treat output&#13;
indicators inadequately. Thus PROSSE will finance consultants services to establish a set of&#13;
appropriate monitoring indicators for the social sectors, measure baseline data and establish a&#13;
system of incentives for executing agencies to increase efficiency by linking budgetary allocations&#13;
to improvements in performance. Such a system will also enable explicit decisions to be made on&#13;
the poverty targeting and inter-state equity of public expenditures in such sectors as health. In&#13;
order to overcome the moral hazard problem, SHCP will instigate physical audits (to measure&#13;
physical outputs and relate these to financial inputs), utilizing suitably qualified independent&#13;
consultants, and qualitative assessments of beneficiaries (real outcomes). Priority will be given to&#13;
developing the system for these social programs likely to provide most scope for future efficiency&#13;
gains, namely (i) hospital care; (ii) secondary technical education and (iii) food and nutrition&#13;
programs. Annex I of the IBRD Memorandum of the President and the IDB project file provide&#13;
an outline of the process and an initial set of efficiency monitoring indicators to be adopted.&#13;
During negotiations agreements were confirmed that the GOM would establish a satisfactory&#13;
system of social sector expenditure efficiency monitoring indicators no later than June 30,&#13;
1996 and that the system would be implemented throughout the remaining life of the&#13;
PROSSE (para. 7.1 (e)).&#13;
4. PROGRAM COSTS, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS&#13;
A. Program Costs and Financing&#13;
4.1   The total program cost is estimated at about US$2,000.0 million, of which an estimated&#13;
US$364.3 million would be foreign exchange (18.2 percent of program costs); taxes amount to&#13;
about US$159.1 million (8.0 percent of program costs). The table below summarizes the&#13;
estimated costs by sub-program.  Investment costs amount to 63.6 percent of total costs;&#13;
recurrent costs account for 36.4 percent of total costs. Program costs were estimated at March&#13;
1995 price levels. Cost estimates for the PROSSE in 1996 were estimated by taking the real 1995&#13;
levels of the budgetary allocations under PROSSE and augmenting these by a factor of 1.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
percent to offset population growth and an additional 4 percent to provide for a modest increase&#13;
in real terms. Foreign and domestic inflation rates were estimated at 2.6 percent and 42 percent&#13;
per annum respectively over the period 1995-96. The exchange rate has been adjusted so as to&#13;
compensate for the difference between international inflation on a US dollar base and local&#13;
inflation rates. Annex 5 provides a detailed breakdown of program costs and financing. All&#13;
program cost estimates are based on current expenditures within the public sector.&#13;
4.2   Incremental Recurrent Costs and Sustainability.  There will be no incremental&#13;
recurrent costs after 1996 as a result of PROSSE, as the programs financed are ongoing. Over&#13;
the implementation period, the efficiency gains anticipated under the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
sub-program would help to increase the cost-effectiveness of the GOM's recurrent expenditures.&#13;
However, the non-wage operating costs of programs supported by PROSSE would be financed&#13;
by the Banks on a declining basis (from 85 percent in 1995, to 50 percent by 1996) as these key&#13;
expenditures would have been cut in the absence of support by PROSSE, thereby undermining the&#13;
delivery of these services. There is in the case of CAPFCE no expansion of the physical number&#13;
of schools, simply the improvement and consolidation of existing schools to enable existing&#13;
teachers to teach the full range of subjects in more adequate premises. As the PROSSE programs&#13;
are amongst the very highest priority social sector programs in Mexico, their sustainability is&#13;
ensured due to the high level commitment to maintain budget allocations for this purpose.&#13;
4.3   Program Financing. The program would be financed by the IBRD, the 1DB and the&#13;
Federal Government. The Government would finance all taxes and duties, estimated at US$159.1&#13;
million, and would finance US$840.9 million of local expenditures, representing 42.0 percent of&#13;
program costs net of taxes and duties. The proposed IBRD and IDB loans of US$500.0 million&#13;
each would finance 50.0 percent of total program costs, or 54.3 percent of program costs net of&#13;
taxes and duties. The two loans would finance 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and&#13;
38.9 percent of local expenditures, net of taxes. The loans would be made to Nacional&#13;
Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), which would make the funds available to executing agencies for the&#13;
implementation of the program.&#13;

4.4    In financing the PROSSE by the two Banks, three principles were observed: (i) simple&#13;
process, wherever possible an entire sub-program would be financed by one of the Banks in its&#13;
entirety; (ii) the experience of the agencies with either one of the financing institutions; and (iii) in&#13;
the case of nutrition, the two Banks would finance equally given their intention to collaborate in a&#13;

B. Procurement&#13;
4.5   The program would finance the procurement of a diverse set of goods, works and services&#13;
in selected programs in SEP, SSA, STPS, and SEDESOL. Designated executing agencies, for&#13;
purposes of procurement, in these Secretariats will be: (a) CONAFE, CONALITEG and&#13;
CAPFCE for SEP; (b) CGOCE as executing agency for works in SSA; (c) the Directorate&#13;
General for Employment (DGE) for STPS; (d) State delegations of SEDESOL and municipios&#13;
for the PESE under SEDESOL; and (e) the Distinbuidora e Impulsora Comercial CONASUPO&#13;
(DICONSA), a subsidiary of the National Agency for the Distribution of Basic Goods&#13;
(CONASIJ1PO), will procure and distribute food supplements for SEDESOL. The IBRD and IDB&#13;
would follow the same procurement procedures unless otherwise noted.&#13;
4.6   Due to the need to ensure rapid and timely disbursements, the Banks will, wherever&#13;
possible, seek to finance large goods and works contracts at the central level, which would be&#13;
awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB), limited international bidding (LIB) (for&#13;
medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, including micronutrients), and national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB), following the IBRD procurement guidelines (January 1995) and IDB's standard&#13;
procurement procedures. For small purchases done by SSA for health programs in the states, by&#13;
STPS for tool kits, and by SEDESOL for food purchases, national shopping procedures would be&#13;
used for contracts financed by the Banks.. National shopping procedures would also be&#13;
acceptable for goods contracts financed by IBRD entered into by executing agencies between&#13;
February 19 and March 31, 1995, eligible for retroactive financing. Such contracts signed after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
April 1, 1995 would follow the SBDs for goods and civil works agreed to between the IBRD and&#13;
GOM, with such modifications as agreed by the IBRD to be necessary for the purpose of the&#13;
program. For the PESE, SEDESOL would utilize direct contracting arrangements acceptable to&#13;
the IDB.&#13;
4.7   Civil Works. The IBRD would finance civil works in the SSA's health sub-programs&#13;
through CGOCE. Contracts awards would be mainly through NCB, for values not less than&#13;
US$350,000 equivalent, without restriction to foreign participation.  For health sub-programs&#13;
financed by the IBRD, contract packages awarded by CGOCE at the central level would not&#13;
exceed US$10.0 million equivalent per package; for education programs financed by IDB,&#13;
contracts awarded by CAPFCE would not exceed US$5.0 million equivalent per package.&#13;
CGOCE would use the prototypes developed under the First Basic Health Project (Loan 3272-&#13;
ME) for the construction of three public health state laboratories, with the necessary technical&#13;
adjustments needed for each location. It would also contract out the supervision of health civil&#13;
works contracts to suitably qualified consultants to ensure consistency with feasibility studies and&#13;
adherence to standards during construction and share these reports with the IBRD upon request.&#13;
4.8   Goods and Equipment. The Banks' financing of contracts for paper for CONALITEG's&#13;
1996 program of in-house printing of primary school textbooks would be done under ICB&#13;
procedures. To cover its 1996 paper needs, CONALITEG would also provide flexibility in its&#13;
bidding procedures to allow split contract awards based on best price combination.  LIB&#13;
procedures may be used by SSA for medical equipment. For purposes of bid evaluation under&#13;
1CB, domestic manufacturers may be allowed a margin of preference in accordance with&#13;
Appendix 2 of the IBRD guidelines. Eligible goods and services include: in SEP (a) paper; (b)&#13;
printing services in CONAFE's and CONALITEG's sub-programs; in SSA: (a) medical&#13;
equipment and instruments; (b) miscellaneous office equipment and furniture; (c) laboratory&#13;
equipment for three public health laboratories; (d) assorted inputs for the local production of&#13;
vaccines by the Gerencia General de Biol6gicos y Reactivos (GBR); (e) vaccines not produced&#13;
by the GBR; (f) medical supplies; and (g) printing and reproduction informational materials&#13;
(printed and audiovisual). NCB procedures may be used for contracting the following eligible&#13;
services: (a) printing of primary school textbooks for contracts costing the equivalent of less than&#13;
US$10.0 million per contract; (b) storage, packaging and distribution services for medical&#13;
supplies, pharmaceuticals and vaccines in SSA and educational materials for SEP, when these&#13;
services are not included in the goods contract in question and are contracted by the states.&#13;
National shopping procedures would be used by STPS to procure up to 10,000 tool-kits for&#13;
trainees in the on-the-job training modality under PROBECAT.&#13;
4.9   Food Supplements. In the nutrition sub-programs financed by the Banks, given the&#13;
limited quantities required (US$8.5 million equivalent), food supplements in the basic food basket&#13;
(consisting of beans, maize flour, salt, sugar and vegetable oil) would be carried out under the&#13;
food procurement agreement between SEDESOL and DICONSA. Purchasing methods used by&#13;
DICONSA would follow national shopping procedures, ensuring that such procurement does not&#13;
restrict foreign participation.  During appraisal, the Banks verified that the prices paid by&#13;
DICONSA for these commodities were below international c.i.f. price equivalents in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
4.10  Technical Assistance. Individual consultants and consultants firms carrying out technical&#13;
assistance for the program, including monitoring and auditing services, feasibility and other&#13;
studies, and supervision of works under the SSA, would be hired following IBRD Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981) and IDB's Standard Procedures for Consulting Services.  During appraisal,&#13;
technical assistance required to support the programs financed by the program were reviewed and&#13;
agreed with each executing agency. For contracting studies and technical assistance services&#13;
financed by the IBRD, all executing agencies would use a standard invitation package and&#13;
contracts as agreed with the EBRD, amended as required for the purpose of the PROSSE.&#13;
4.11   Other Costs Not Involving Procurement. Approximately 15.8 percent of program costs&#13;
or approximately US$315.2 million equivalent, would not involve procurement. These costs&#13;
include operational expenses, and stipends and training (which would be contracted to public and&#13;
private sector training institutions in the same manner as the Labor Market and Productivity&#13;
Enhancement project, Loan 3542-ME), as well as travel and per diem expenses in programs&#13;
financed by both Banks.&#13;
4.12 Review by the EBRD. Prior review by the IBRD would be required for: (a) all annual&#13;
procurement plans done by each executing agencies; and (b) procurement procedures and&#13;
documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, tender packages and&#13;
related contracts for miscellaneous goods under NCB above US$2.0 million equivalent, all NCB&#13;
contracts done by CONALITEG for printing services in 1996, and all civil works contracts above&#13;
US$2.0 million. In addition, the IBRD would review all supporting documentation for contracts&#13;
for goods valued at above US$350,000 equivalent, entered into during the period allowed for&#13;
retroactive financing (para. 4.16). It is expected that these prior review arrangement would result&#13;
in about 65 percent of IBRD-financed contracts by value. All terms of reference for technical&#13;
assistance and studies would be subject to prior review by the IBRD. Documentation for&#13;
contracts with consultants' firms, valued above US$100,000 equivalent and for individual&#13;
consultants, valued above US$50,000 equivalent, would be also be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Banks. Other contracts under these thresholds would be reviewed by NAFIN under the fimite&#13;
autonomo procedures agreed with the Bank. During appraisal it was agreed that procedures for&#13;
prior and ex-ante review would be followed by all executing agencies. Ex-post review would be&#13;
applicable for all contract documentation retained by all executing agencies, to be done by&#13;
subsequent examnination by IBRD supervision missions.&#13;
4.13  Prior Review by IDB. IDB reserves the right to review all supporting documentation for&#13;
contracts for goods valued at above US$350,000 equivalent, and contracts for works valued at or&#13;
above US$5.0 million, entered during the period allowed for retroactive financing.&#13;

pregnant women will be purchased under the nutrition sub-program.&#13;
(2)    This would be used for the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.&#13;
4.14  Procurement Supervision. Detailed procurement and disbursement procedures are&#13;
already included in the operating manuals for SEP, SSA, STPS, and SEDESOL, where other&#13;
programs financed by both Banks are under execution. NAFIN would support these agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
with experienced staff in procurement procedures of both Banks. All executing agencies have&#13;
experienced staff who can be called upon to supervise the preparation of bidding programs and&#13;
packages, and ensure compliance with agreed procurement procedures during implementation.&#13;
Each executing agency would be responsible for the maintenance of the appropriate records for&#13;
the review by both Banks (prior and ex-post).&#13;
4.15  Country Procurement Assessment. No recent Country Procurement Assessment on&#13;
Mexico is available. However, Mexico's procurement regulations (Ley de Adquisiciones y&#13;
Contrataciones, December 1993) clearly authorize the application of procurement procedures of&#13;
international financial institutions for the procurement of civil works, goods, equipment and&#13;
services, where the financing for such procurement comes from international financial institutions.&#13;
4.16 Retroactive financing of up to US$200.0 million equivalent (US100.0 million from both&#13;
the IBRD and IDB, amounting to 20 percent of each total loan amount) would be provided to&#13;
help cover eligible expenditures for civil works, equipment, goods, pharmaceuticals, medical&#13;
supplies, technical assistance and studies, training and stipends made on or after February 19,&#13;
1995 (in the case of the IBRD) and January 1, 1995 (in the case of the IDB).&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
4.17 The proposed program would be partially financed by a IBRD loan of about US$500.0&#13;
million and an IDB loan of US$500.0 million to be disbursed over the two year period 1995-96,&#13;
with the target of disbursing 60 percent of these resources in the critical year of 1995 (see Annex&#13;
5 and tables 11 and 13). By financing and strengthening existing programs both implementation&#13;
and disbursements will be accelerated. The PROSSE is expected to be completed by December&#13;
31, 1996 and the IBRD and IDB loan accounts are expected to be closed by June 30, 1997.&#13;
4.18  Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against expenditures to be presented to&#13;
the IBRD and fully documented for: civil works contracts of US$2.0 million and above, US$1.0&#13;
million, foods, materials and equipment contracts of US$350,000 or more and for consultant&#13;
contracts with individuals of US$50,000 or more and with firms of US$100,000 or more, subject&#13;
to prior review as per para. 4.12. Claims for expenditures under contracts below those amounts&#13;
and other expenditures not covered by a contract, such as stipends, training costs, operational&#13;
expenses, travel allowances, etc. would be disbursed against presentation of Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting documentation would be retained by the&#13;
executing agencies for periodic inspection by the IBRD and by external auditors.&#13;

eligible expenditures incurred since January 1, 1995.&#13;
4.19 In the case of the IBRD, a Special Account in U.S. dollars, with an authorized allocation&#13;
of US$100.0 million, would be established at the Banco de Mexico. Normal documentation&#13;
requirements apply, except that in addition, a copy of the bank statement from the institution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
holding the account detailing the transactions made and reconciled by the borrower would&#13;
accompany each replenishment request. The account would be replenished on a monthly basis, at&#13;
the recommended level of US$25.0 milliion. In the case of the IDB, an Advance of US$100.0&#13;
million would be made to NAFIN.&#13;
4.20  Disbursement Procedures. Each executing agency, with the technical support from&#13;
NAFIN, would prepare the necessary documentation for prompt disbursement from the Special&#13;
Account. SOEs will be prepared on the basis of Cuentas por Liquidar Certificadas stamped by&#13;
an appropriate financial institution (i.e. canceled GOM payment cheques) as evidence of actual&#13;
expenditures made. NAFIN would be in charge of overall coordination, logistical support and&#13;
field supervision of the program.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.21  All executing agencies and NAFIN would maintain records and accounts adequate to&#13;
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in&#13;
connection with the execution of the program. These records would reflect the resources and&#13;
expenditures in connection with the execution of the entire program. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was confirmed that SHCP, NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and STPS would: (i)&#13;
have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and qualified&#13;
auditors with a separate opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards and procedures, and with the specific current understanding with the&#13;
Mexican authorities; (ii) furnish to the Banks, no later than six months after the end of each&#13;
year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish to the Banks such other&#13;
information concerning the records and accounts as well as the audit as the Banks would&#13;
from time to time reasonably request (para 7.1(f)). For all expenditures with respect to which&#13;
withdrawals from the Loan Account were made on the basis of SOEs, and for all expenditures&#13;
with respect to which withdrawals were made from the Special Account, the executing agencies&#13;
would upon request provide to NAFIN all records and accounts necessary to allow the timely&#13;
performance of its obligations, and to the independent auditors, both the records and the&#13;
supporting documentation.&#13;
5. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Program Implementation&#13;
5.1   The program would be overseen by SHCP through the existing Technical Committee for&#13;
Budget Integration (Comite Tecnico de Integracion Presupuestal: COTEIP). The COTEIP is&#13;
chaired by SHCP (Direccion General de Politica Presupuestal) and includes NAFIN, other&#13;
elements of SHCP, and would include high-level representatives of the other PROSSE&#13;
implementing agencies for the purpose of implementing PROSSE. COTEIP would monitor&#13;
overall implementation and oversee the process of physical and financial auditing of PROSSE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
activities as a means of laying the foundation for future efficiency gains in social sector&#13;
expenditures. SHCP (Politica Presupuestal) would ensure that the budgetary resources for the&#13;
programs supported by the PROSSE would be released in a timely manner. NAFIN would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that the executing agencies adhere to the Banks' procurement guidelines&#13;
and that the requisite documentation is prepared promptly for disbursement by the Banks. SEP,&#13;
together with its subsidiary organizations - CAPFCE, CONALITEG and CONAFE - would&#13;
implement the basic education sub-program; SSA would implement the basic health services sub-&#13;
program. STPS would implement the labor retraining sub-program and SEDESOL would&#13;
implement the short-term employment generation sub-program. SEDESOL, SSA and the DIF&#13;
would implement the priority food and nutrition program through the state and municipal&#13;
governments. SHCP would implement the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.&#13;
5.2   Program  Readiness for Implementation.  In the case of health, education and&#13;
PROBECAT, PROSSE essentially finances ongoing programs and activities, and is thus by&#13;
definition ready for immediate implementation. In the case of the PESE, the GOM has defined&#13;
the operational parameters (paras.3. 17 and 7.1 (d)). In the case of nutrition, one state (Hidalgo)&#13;
is ready to proceed. Additional states will enter into the program in 1996. The Banks have&#13;
already started to provide informal technical assistance to the SHCP to initiate the Monitoring &amp;&#13;
Evaluation Sub-program&#13;
5.3   Monitoring  Indicators.   During  appraisal, monitoring  indicators for program&#13;
implementation and initial program impact were discussed and agreed (Annex 2) including&#13;
preliminary physical targets for 1996. These will form the basis for the program implementation&#13;
Quarterly Reviews (para. 5.5).&#13;
B. Supervision&#13;
5.4   Supervision would focus on the quarterly review of physical attainment of the sub-&#13;
programs against the monitoring indicators and the budget release for the PROSSE supported&#13;
activities. Special attention will be paid to monitoring the effectiveness of targeting to the poor of&#13;
the PROSSE supported programs and providing training and technical assistance to procurement&#13;
staff in agencies with limited experience with the Banks' procurement procedures (paras. 6.8 and&#13;
6.12). The supervision team would be carefully planned and would be a combination of IBRD&#13;
and IDB staff and consultants who would be recruited according to the critical needs of program&#13;
implementation. It is estimated that 60 staffweeks will be required for supervision in FY96 and 35&#13;
in FY97. This estimate takes into account the multi-sectoral nature of PROSSE, the institutional&#13;
development aspects, the prior review and procurement arrangements as agreed under PROSSE&#13;
(see paras. 4.5 to 4.10 and 4.12 to 4.14).&#13;
C. Quarterly Reviews&#13;
5.5   The Banks will monitor compliance with the program through a program of Quarterly&#13;
Reviews. Each Quarterly Review will be organized by the SHCP, and will include representatives&#13;
of all the executing agencies and NAFIN. The purpose of the quarterly review meeting would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
to evaluate program performance against implementation plans and agreed targets; provide&#13;
management with feedback on program achievements and areas needing improvement; and further&#13;
develop programmatic improvements to increase the efficiency of social sector expenditures. A&#13;
useful tool in this regard will be the physical audits and qualitative assessments undertaken&#13;
through Sub-Program 5 (paras. 3.22-3.23). The reviews and planning process will provide a tool&#13;
for on-going refinements in program strategies and plans, consistent with the overall objectives of&#13;
the program. During negotiations, agreements were confirmed that the GOM would&#13;
undertake Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary releases and physical implementation progress&#13;
of PROSSE with the Banks (para 7.I (g)).&#13;
5.6  In addition to the general objectives of review outlined above, each review will have&#13;
additional specific objectives. The first Quarterly Review, to be held in August 1995, will focus&#13;
on program effectiveness and accelerating initial disbursements. The November 1995 review will&#13;
focus on the budget allocations for programs supported by PROSSE in 1996.  During&#13;
negotiations, agreements were confirmed that the GOM would: prepare a preliminary action&#13;
plan (including physical targets and budget, using Annex 2 as a basis), for the programs to be&#13;
supported by PROSSE in 1996 as part of the November 1995 review; and confirm a definitive&#13;
action plan for the programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to the Banks,&#13;
as part of the February 1996 review and that no changes would be made in the allocations for&#13;
such programs without prior consultation with the Banks (para. 7.1 (h)). The February 1996&#13;
review will focus on the achievement against indicators for 1995 and confirm actual budget&#13;
allocations for 1996. The May 1996 review will focus on reviewing progress in establishing the&#13;
new social sector monitoring and budget impact system in the SHCP Politica Presupuestal (para.&#13;
3.23) and how this system could be utilized in the 1997 budget allocations. The August 1996&#13;
review will focus on the 1997 budget allocations and possible follow up time-slice operations such&#13;
as the PROSSE. The November 1996 review will focus on an assessment of accomplishments&#13;
under PROSSE, the 1997 budget, and include the appraisal of any follow-on program support.&#13;
The February 1997 review will focus on the Implementation Completion Report and the&#13;
finalization of disbursements.&#13;
6. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Program Benefits&#13;
6.1   The program would help reduce possible increases in poverty brought about by the&#13;
economic recession, through preserving essential social services for the poor, providing training&#13;
and employment enhancement opportunities for 800,000 unemployed and underemployed&#13;
workers over the two year period through PROBECAT (350,000 in 1995 and 450,000 in 1996),&#13;
plus 550,000 short-term jobs for the unemployed poor in 1995 through the SEDESOL program,&#13;
providing enhanced food and nutrition supplements to women and children in priority areas.&#13;
Indigenous populations will benefit in particular from the services provided under the basic&#13;
education, health and nutrition sub-programs as these programs are targeted to the poorest areas&#13;
where the indigenous populations are concentrated. The primary benefit of the PROSSE for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
selected services and programs is that it commits SHCP and the executing agencies to support&#13;
priority programs targeted to the poor.&#13;
6.2   Program Objective and Poverty Category: The PROSSE forms a central part of the&#13;
program of targeted interventions for Mexico by protecting essential social services to the poor&#13;
and strengthening a low-cost social safety net, through short-term employment generation to&#13;
those adversely affected by the economic crisis and food and nutrition programs to the most&#13;
vulnerable groups of the population. It thus falls under the Poverty Reduction category. The&#13;
essential social services included are focused on the poor in the following manner: CONAFE&#13;
works only among the poor mainly in isolated rural areas, civil works covered under PROSSE are&#13;
exclusively in poor rural and peri-urban areas, whilst the SSA services are self-targeting to the&#13;
poor, as they cover only the population without access to the social security system or without the&#13;
financial means to go to the private sector. The labor retraining and employment promotion&#13;
program is exclusively to the unemployed and underemployed as they are registered by the state&#13;
employment services in the case of STPS, or self-targeted to the poorest by the compensation&#13;
equivalent to only 80 percent of the minimum wage in the case of the short term employment&#13;
program under SEDESOL. The nutrition program uses nutritional indicators, which have an&#13;
extremely high correlation with poverty, and the CONAPO poverty index (based upon 10 census&#13;
indicators of poverty) to identify the beneficiary municipios.&#13;
6.3   Environmental Aspects. No major environmental issues are foreseen. However, due to&#13;
the inclusion of the scattered small civil works physical sub-programs under the employment&#13;
generation sub-program (para. 3.17), PROSSE is rated category "B" for environmental purposes.&#13;
The environmental impact of sub-programs is expected to be handled according to the criteria and&#13;
procedures agreed in the IDB financed Municipal Development Program (Loan ME- 0051, FY&#13;
95).&#13;
6.4   Under the small civil works sub-programs, no significant direct or indirect negative&#13;
environmental impact is expected from the spot construction and maintenance actions. Final&#13;
engineering designs are prepared on the basis of agreed technical guidelines for the spot&#13;
improvement program, which include actions to alleviate, reverse, of offset direct environmental&#13;
impacts, in particular those related to erosion and siltation.  By their very nature, spot&#13;
improvements and routine maintenance focus on identification, diagnosis and elimination of&#13;
erosion problems. Since the selected roads are existing ones and among the oldest in the rural&#13;
road network, additional indirect negative impacts linked with human activities are almost&#13;
nonexistent.&#13;
6.5   Participatory Approach: A number of elements of PROSSE involve strong community&#13;
participation, namely: (a) under the education sub-program, the community provides food and&#13;
accommodation for the CONAFE community teachers in rural areas, whilst indigenous&#13;
populations participate in the development and design of textbooks for indigenous education; (b)&#13;
under the health sub-program, community participation is mobilized during the health campaigns;&#13;
(c) under the employment sub-program, communities form committees and make proposals to the&#13;
municipio for small infrastructure projects to be managed by themselves (with technical support&#13;
from the states and municipios) thus following the approach already well tested under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
PRONASOL; and (d) the priority nutrition sub-program involves close community participation&#13;
in: health and school activities; food distribution logistics; and development of priority projects&#13;
selected by the community (i.e. sanitation, housing, improvements to community health posts and&#13;
schools).&#13;
B. Economic Benefits&#13;
6.6   Whilst it is not possible to undertake an economic evaluation of the PROSSE as a whole,&#13;
the PROSSE supports the most essential and some of the most cost-effective social sector&#13;
programs in Mexico. The relevant economic analysis behind some of the programs supported by&#13;
PROSSE is presented in detail in Annex 6.&#13;
6.7   This analysis may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Education: Recent analysis (based upon data for 1992) shows that the average&#13;
economic social rate of return per additional year of schooling is 11.8 percent for&#13;
primary education and 14.7 percent for lower secondary (the highest rate of return&#13;
for all levels of education studied) - it is lowest for tertiary education. The fact&#13;
that lower secondary education shows a higher rate of return at the margin reflects&#13;
the near universality of primary education in Mexico (and hence diminishing rates&#13;
of return to primary education). Whilst this establishes a clear case for expanding&#13;
lower secondary education although telesecundaria in rural areas, it is self-evident&#13;
that in order to obtain such returns, children must first complete primary education&#13;
satisfactorily. Thus for population groups without adequate access to primary&#13;
education, the highest priority investments are those to ensure satisfactory&#13;
completion of primary education as the foundation for secondary education.&#13;
Unfortunately this analysis did not include analysis of rates of return for pre-school&#13;
education, although recent analysis, based upon the US experience shows high&#13;
rates of return to pre-school education.&#13;
(b)   Health:  Analysis undertaken by the SSA, with IBRD  assistance, in 1994&#13;
measured cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved as a result of over&#13;
100 health interventions. The most cost-effective interventions (with cost per&#13;
DALY saved of less than N$3,000) are all included in the basic package of&#13;
services provided by the SSA under PROSSE. They range from N$58 per DALY&#13;
saved for attention to sick children for treatment of acute diarrhea in children,&#13;
N$182 for treatment of leprosy, through to diagnosis of cervical-uterine cancer&#13;
N$1,287, health education N$2,000, treatment of asthma at N$2,772 and&#13;
treatment of burns at N$2,984. At the opposite extreme, curative and preventive&#13;
services not in the package supported under PROSSE include: osteoporosis&#13;
prevention N$7,500, by-pass surgery N$10,985, and multiple sclerosis treatment at&#13;
N$37,157 per DALY saved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
(c)   Labor Retraining: Based upon a cost benefit analysis completed April 19, 1995,&#13;
PROBECAT had a positive impact for 10 out of 12 categories of trainees&#13;
evaluated, representing 95.5 percent of all trainees. Particularly, encouraging was&#13;
the positive impact upon women (this is in contract to the earlier analysis as&#13;
reported in the SAR for the Labor Market &amp; Productivity Enhancement project&#13;
(Loan 3542-ME). Once again, the analysis clearly demonstrates the enhanced&#13;
effectiveness of in-plant training (one modality of on-the-job training) over class-&#13;
room based training for those without prior work experience. This also provides a&#13;
basis for shifting a significant proportion of trainees to the on-the-job training&#13;
modality.&#13;
C. Program Risks&#13;
6.8   The PROSSE is subject to four potential risks: (a) the uncertainty regarding budgetary&#13;
allocations; (b) program diversity; (c) that PROSSE programs fail in their targeting arrangements&#13;
and efficiency; and (d) failure to disburse adequately as a result of inexperience of some&#13;
implementation agencies with the two Banks' procurement procedures.&#13;
6.9   Dealing with the first risk, uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations, is an essential&#13;
element of PROSSE. Mexico continues to face a high degree of uncertainty in terms of the&#13;
macroeconomic variables which determine the budgetary ceilings. The GOM has undertaken to&#13;
protect high priority social service programs from further cuts under the PROSSE. The Banks&#13;
will monitor budgetary releases carefully during implementation on a quarterly basis.&#13;
6.10  The second risk, program diversity, is being mitigated by concentrating upon a smaller&#13;
number of agencies, most of which already have experience with IBRD or IDB procedures. Co-&#13;
financing has also greatly facilitated simplification: for example the IBRD will exclusively finance&#13;
the SSA, building upon the IBRD's long operational experience with the SSA; whilst the IDB will&#13;
finance the entire PESE under SEDESOL, where the IDB procedures are well adapted to the&#13;
realities of a highly decentralized program.&#13;
6.11  The third risk, is that the PROSSE programs failing either their targeting arrangements or&#13;
efficiency gains. All of the PROSSE supported programs are targeted to the poor to varying&#13;
degrees (see para. 6.2), however there are leakages with even the best targeted programs.&#13;
Targeting effectiveness will be monitored carefully during supervision (para. 5.4) and through the&#13;
physical auditing arrangements (para. 5.5). Increasing the efficiency of the programs supported&#13;
by PROSSE, along with other social sector programs, will need to be worked out over the&#13;
medium-term. PROSSE itself, through sub-program 5 "Monitoring and Evaluation" will lay the&#13;
foundation and develop methodologies to measure and incentives to increase efficiency.&#13;
6.12 Within the fourth risk, a potential problem that could impede disbursements is the&#13;
inexperience of agencies such as CONALITEG, DIF, some health directorates and state health&#13;
secretariats in Banks' procurement procedures. To minimize this risk, training of procurement&#13;
staff in these agencies will be organized as part of the Banks' supervision programs, and technical&#13;
assistance will be provided by staff at the Banks' Resident Missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, the Banks and the GOM confirmed that the GOM would:&#13;
(a)   endeavor to execute budgetary policy in the social sectors, including mechanisms&#13;
to protect budgetary allocations to the PROSSE during the financial crisis and&#13;
measures to increase efficiency of social sector expenditures, according to the&#13;
agreed letter of policy intent (para. 2.8);&#13;
(b)   release budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the executing agencies under&#13;
PROSSE in 1995 in accordance with the agreed 1995 budget allocations and&#13;
physical targets included in Annex 2 and that the GOM may substitute an&#13;
alternative budget, if satisfactory to the Banks, for the PROSSE prior to June 30,&#13;
1995 (para. 2.8);&#13;
(c)   review the results of the CONALITEG productivity study and present an action&#13;
plan to the Banks by July 31, 1996 (para. 3.5);&#13;
(d)   execute the PESE through SEDESOL according to the agreed operational&#13;
modalities (para. 3.17);&#13;
(e)   establish a satisfactory system of social sector expenditure efficiency monitoring&#13;
indicators no later than June 30, 1996 and that the system would be implemented&#13;
throughout the remaining life of the PROSSE (para. 3.23);&#13;
(f)   through SHCP, NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and STPS: (i) have the records and&#13;
accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and qualified auditors with a&#13;
separate opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards and procedures, and with the specific current understanding&#13;
with the Mexican authorities; (ii) furnish to the Banks, no later than six months&#13;
after the end of each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii)&#13;
furnish to the Banks such other information concerning the records and accounts&#13;
as well as the audit as the Banks would from time to time reasonably request (para.&#13;
4.21);&#13;
(g)   undertake the Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary releases and physical&#13;
implementation progress of PROSSE with the Banks (para. 5.5); and&#13;
(h)   prepare a preliminary action plan (including physical targets and budget, using&#13;
Annex 2 as a basis), for the programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996 as part&#13;
of the November 1995 review; and confirm a definitive action plan for the&#13;
programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to the Banks, as part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
of the February 1996 review and that no changes would be made in the allocations&#13;
for such programs without prior consultation with the Banks (para. 5.6)).&#13;
7.2   Recommendation. Subject to compliance to the above conditions, the proposed program&#13;
is suitable for: (a) an IBRD loan of US$500.0 million equivalent to NAFIN, with the guarantee of&#13;
the United Mexican States, for 15 years, including a 3-year grace period at the IBRD's standard&#13;
variable interest rate; and (b) an IDB loan of US$500.0 million equivalent to NAFIN with the&#13;
guarantee of the United Mexican States, for 20 years, including a 4 year grace period at the IDB's&#13;
standard variable interest rate, including an inspection fee of 1 percent of the loan amount.&#13;

TERMINOS DE REFERENCIA PARA DEFINIR UN PROGRAMA DE MEJORA EN LA&#13;
PRODUCTIVIDAD DE LAS ACTIVIDADES DE LA COMISION NACIONAL DE LOS&#13;
LIBROS DE TEXTO GRATUITOS&#13;
Antecedentes&#13;
1.    La Comisi6n Nacional de los Libros de Texto Gratuitos (CONALITEG) es un organismo&#13;
publico descentralizado que fue creada el 13 de febrero de 1959, con personalidad juridica y&#13;
patrimonio propios, que tiene por objeto la edici6n, impresi6n y distribuci6n de los libros de texto&#13;
gratuitos, materiales didacticos y similares.&#13;
2.    Para el cumplimiento de su objetivo, la Comisi6n tiene las siguientes funciones:&#13;
(a)    Editar e imprimir los libros de texto gratuitos y toda clase de materiales didicticos&#13;
similares, mediante sus propias instalaciones, por concurso o de otro modo si estos&#13;
resultasen insuficientes;&#13;
(b)   Coadyuvar con la Secretaria de Educaci6n Puiblica (SEP) en el disenio de los libros&#13;
gratuitos otros materiales didicticos;&#13;
(c)   Participar con un representante en el Consejo de Contenidos y Metodos todos&#13;
Educativos de la SEP;&#13;
(d)   Distribuir los libros y toda clase de materiales didicticos similares que produzca; y&#13;
(e)    Los demis necesarios para el cumplimiento de su objetivo.&#13;
3.    En 1994 CONALITEG distribuy6 134.4 millones de libros de texto, con 157 titulos, de los&#13;
cuales 75 por ciento fueron subcontratados a diversos impresores y el resto elaborados en los talleres&#13;
de la empresa. La distribuci6n se realiza mediante contratistas que llevan los libros, con una carga de&#13;
60,000 toneladas, a 208 almacenes en el interior del pais, y 783 almacenes en el area metropolitana,&#13;
donde la entrega se hace a nivel de zona escolar. La comisi6n tiene 1,315 plazas de planta.&#13;
4.    Ademis del libro de texto gratuito, la CONALITEG produce otros materiales educativos&#13;
como pueden ser ediciones en lenguas indigenas y materiales para no videntes en "Braille".&#13;
5.    La productividad de la CONALITEG se ha deteriorado en los ultimos tiempos; problemas de&#13;
equipo, organizaci6n, metodos, capacitaci6n, y de otra indole, lo que hace necesario mejorar sus&#13;
operaciones. La estructura administrativa es pesada y por ende, parte importante en la ineficiencia de&#13;
la Comisi6n.&#13;
6.    Las operaciones que actualmente lleva a cabo la CONALITEG se sefialan en el siguiente&#13;
cuadro:&#13;

supervise la correcta y oportuna distribuci6n de&#13;
los mismos.   Asimismo, se hace cargo del&#13;
almacenaje de estos materiales en las instalaciones&#13;
de la Comisi6n.&#13;
7.    A estas actividades substantivas se agregan las tareas normales de administraci6n requeridas&#13;
para su funcionamiento. Merece especial menci6n la tarea de control de calidad, que asegura que el&#13;
producto lHene las especificaciones requeridas, al mismo tiempo que seniala que requiere de mejoras.&#13;
Objetivo&#13;
8.    Definir mediante un estudio de mejora de productividad en las actividades de la CONALITEG,&#13;
cuil seria la altemativa que permita producir y distribuir los libros de texto gratuitos y materiales&#13;
educativos adicionales a un menor costo para el pais, sea a traves una mejora de su operaci6n, de un&#13;
canbio tecnol6gico, o mediante la subcontrataci6n de todas o algunas de sus actividades.&#13;
Aspectos Metodol6gicos&#13;
9.    La firma consultora debera desarrollar la informaci6n necesaria para que la CONALITEG&#13;
tome la decisi6n respecto al modo de mejorar la productividad de la Comisi6n. Para este fin se preven&#13;
tres escenarios basicos:&#13;
(a)   Permanecer en la ubicaci6n actual y con el equipo actual, preparando un plan de&#13;
mejora de productividad que incluya la aplicaci6n de ingenieria industrial, cambios en el&#13;
disefio de la planta, capacitaci6n del personal, reestructuraci6n administrativa, mejor&#13;
mantenimiento de los equipos existentes, de manera que se obtenga la maxima&#13;
eficiencia posible en las instalaciones actuales y trabajando a la maxima capacidad que&#13;
pueda alcanzar la planta.&#13;
(b)   Hacer una renovaci6n de la planta y equipo, considerando la posibilidad de cambiar su&#13;
ubicaci6n, e incorporando medidas de entrenamiento, reestructuraci6n administrativa y&#13;
cualquier otra necesaria p ara llegar a la maxima productividad de la planta&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61                                 ANNEX 3&#13;
TOR for CONALITEG&#13;

(c)    Subcontratar total o parcialmente las operaciones actuales con empresas del sector&#13;
publico o privado, segun resulte mas conveniente, reduciendo el personal y&#13;
reestructurando las actividades administrativas y de calidad para alcanzar la maxima&#13;
productividad en estas condiciones.&#13;
10.   Los tres escenarios deberan ser comparados entre si para evaluar el costo beneficio de&#13;
cada opci6n. Se sugiere que en cada caso la evaluaci6n considere el valor del dinero en el tiempo,&#13;
mediante una tasa interna de retorno, valor presente neto u otro metodo sugerido por el&#13;
consultor. Para este efecto, el consultor sugerira y sustentara el periodo mas apropiado para la&#13;
evaluaci6n de cada opci6n. No deberia ser menor a 5 anios.&#13;
11.   En los tres casos, el calculo de costo/beneficio debera considerar el costo de indemnizaci6n del&#13;
personal desplazado y el valor de rescate del equipo; el valor de las instalaci6n es y bienes raices que se&#13;
sustituyan, si es el caso, los planes de mejora de la productividad incluirin todas las actividades de la&#13;
Comisi6n.&#13;
12.   Dado el papel que juega la Comisi6n, debera conservar el control de las actividades de&#13;
aseguramiento de calidad, estas requieren ser desarrolladas de una manera mis amplia de lo que lo son&#13;
actualmente, por lo que se debera incluir en el programa de mejora un aparato de reestructuraci6n y&#13;
desarrollo de estas actividades.&#13;
13.   El resultado de los tres escenarios debera ser entregado con un anglisis de sensibilidad de cada&#13;
opci6n, incluyendo la sensibilidad de los costos financieros y la paridad de la moneda, asi como, un&#13;
modelo financiero computarizado que permita ampliar este analisis de sensibilidad y manejar escenarios&#13;
nixtos entre el escenario 2 y 3.&#13;
14.   Dado que no existe un sistema de costos formal en la CONALITEG, se sugiere al consultor&#13;
hacer una revisi6n de la informaci6n contable disponible antes de elaborar su propuesta y cotizaci6n, ya&#13;
que tendria que definir los costos actuales de operaci6n mediante un muestreo de las operaciones y de&#13;
la contabilidad existente. El metodo que piensa emplear para definir estos costos debera ser&#13;
establecido como un anexo de su propuesta.&#13;
15.   Para comprar los tres escenarios, el proyecto debera ubicar las posibles fuentes de ahorro y&#13;
valorarias. Se espera que cada escenario contenga, ademas de la informaci6n de costos, el plan de&#13;
mejora de productividad en cada caso con informaci6n suficiente para que la CONALITEG pueda&#13;
emprender el plan que resulte mas apropiado. Esto incluye las areas de mejora ubicadas, las&#13;
actividades a realizar una estimaci6n de tiempo y costo de las mismas. En el caso de la renovaci6n de&#13;
equipos se deberi entregar cotizaciones del costo de los mismos, comparando varias opciones. El nivel&#13;
de detaDle de los costos debera ser el usual en un estudio de factibilidad.&#13;

PROBECAT - Selection Criteria&#13;
and Implementation Details&#13;
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR TRAINEES UNDER PROBECAT&#13;
PROBECAT will operate under three modalities during 1995 and 1996, namely: (a)&#13;
retraining for unemployed workers full time within training institutions (Escolarizada); (b)&#13;
retraining for unemployed and underemployed workers in plant (Mixta); and (iii) on the job&#13;
training. The eligibility criteria for each modality are given below - in all cases preference will be&#13;
given to those with one or more economic dependents.&#13;
(a) Retraining for Unemployed Workers - Escolarizada&#13;
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:'&#13;
(c)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;&#13;
(d)   have prior work experience if entering classroom training (minimum 3 months);&#13;
(e)    be between the ages of 16 and 55 years; and&#13;
(f)    have either complete primary or some secondary education.&#13;
(b) Retraining for Unemployed and Underemployed Workers - Mixia&#13;
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
(g)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;&#13;
(h)   be between the ages of 16 and 55 years;&#13;
(i)    have basic reading, writing and numeric skills (to be tested); and&#13;
(j)    not necessarily have prior work experience.&#13;
(c) Retraining for Unemployed and Underemployed Workers - On the Job&#13;
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
(k)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;&#13;
(1)    be between the ages of 16 and 55 years; and&#13;
(m) have basic reading, writing and numeric skills (to be tested).&#13;
This modality would incorporate a minimum of 150,000 trainees.&#13;
It is projected that at least 61,000 trainees would fully comply with these criteria, whilst a certain degree of&#13;
flexibility would be admitted in terms of prior work experience and education attainment for the the remaining&#13;
trainees under this modality in view of the substantially increased demand due to the economic recession.&#13;

PROSSE Economic Analysis&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROSSE&#13;
A variety of existing evaluations of programs supported by PROSSE, and other&#13;
evaluations of social sector programs more generally, provide strong evidence of the economic&#13;
effectiveness and benefits of the programs included under PROSSE. The results of these&#13;
evaluations and their relationship to PROSSE are presented below are:&#13;
1. The Returns to Education in Mexico - based upon a paper prepared by George&#13;
Psacharopoulos, Eduardo Velez, Hongyu Yang and Alex Panagides (1994);&#13;
2. Economic Efficiency of Selected Health Programs - based on work undertaken by&#13;
FUNSALUD in Mexico (1994); and&#13;
3. PROBECAT Program Evaluation Study - based upon the evaluation study completed by&#13;
STPS (1995); and&#13;
(A) The Returns to Education in Mexico&#13;
1.    Economic analysis based upon the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los&#13;
Hogares - ENIGH - (a nationwide household survey which utilizes a stratified random sample&#13;
conducted by INEGI) indicates that: (a) the returns to an investment in education are depressed&#13;
during periods of economic recession and rise again as economic growth resumes; (b) the returns&#13;
to education remain high, even after a significant expansion of the educational system; and (c) in&#13;
terms of investment priorities at the margin, secondary education exhibits the highest rate of&#13;
return in Mexico. However, by definition, such marginal rates of return are only possible for&#13;
those children who complete primary education satisfactorily; where this is not the case, as in&#13;
many isolated rural areas, priority still rests in ensuring that children have access to and complete&#13;
primary education of adequate quality.&#13;
2.    Overall Private Returns.  Using the Mincerian human capital eanlings function&#13;
specification applied to the ENIGH sample of each survey years (1984,1989 and 1992), estimates&#13;
of the overtime private rate of return to investment in education were calculated as shown in&#13;
Table 1 below:&#13;

3. Private and Social Returns by Level of Education. Application of the "full discounting&#13;
method" to the age-earnings profiles, and the unit costs for different levels of education, gave the&#13;
private and social returns to education appearing in Table 2.&#13;
Table 2: The Returns to Education (percent)&#13;

4.    Regarding the private retums, those for primary education have steadily fallen over the&#13;
years due to the near universal coverage of primary education. The private returns to the two&#13;
levels of secondary education show no clear pattem. But the private retums to university&#13;
education have fallen and risen with the growth of the economy. The social rates of return for&#13;
education are consistently lower than the private rates of return - consistent with the experience of&#13;
other countries.&#13;
5.    Conclusion.  The retums to education largely follow the macro-economic cycle.&#13;
Economic recession lowers the returns to human capital, whereas economic growth boosts them.&#13;
Second, when a country reaches a stage where primary education coverage is near universal,&#13;
secondary education is the next priority for educational investment at the margin. However, for&#13;

Development Report "Investing in Health", the GOM (through FIJNSALUD) has made estimates&#13;
of the disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) saved for over 100 health interventions and related&#13;
these to the unit costs of such interventions. These were then ranked from the most cost-effective&#13;
(lowest unit cost per DALY saved) to the least cost-effective. The first 70 such interventions are&#13;
listed in the attached table.&#13;
7.    The services selected for protection under the PROSSE's Basic Health sub-program&#13;
follow the priorities established in this GOM study (which was supported by the IBRD and IDB in&#13;
1994) of the economics of health care provision in Mexico. The starting point of the analysis was&#13;
the identification of the principal sources of illness in Mexico, as measured by their contribution to&#13;
the estimated 12.8 million DALYs lost prematurely in 1991. The study examined over one&#13;
hundred health interventions to establish their potential effectiveness and their cost. These&#13;
analyses were combined to develop an optimal package of 24 services. Each of the activities&#13;
protected by the PROSSE has thus been evaluated as dealing with a significant source of ill health&#13;
(responsible for 1 percent or more of premature DALY's lost in Mexico) and whose cost per&#13;
DALY saved is less than N$3,000.&#13;
8.    As an illustration of the results obtained, the provision of integrated care for sick children,&#13;
which will be supported under the Basic Health Care sub-program, was shown to be the single&#13;
most cost effective intervention available in Mexico, with a cost per DALY gained of N$58&#13;
(1991). Similarly, pre- and post- natal care, both financed under the Preventive care sub-program&#13;
had an estimated cost per DALY gained of less than N$300. The study also identified these two&#13;
programs as having the largest potential impact on reducing premature DALY's lost in Mexico.&#13;
The attached table lists the 70 most cost-effective interventions which are the types of&#13;
interventions included in the basic service package supported under PROSSE.&#13;

(C) PROBECAT Program Evaluation Study&#13;
9.    PROBECAT (Programa de Becas de Capacitacion para Trabajadores) was established in&#13;
1984 by the Mexican government to retrain unemployed and displaced workers. The acceleration&#13;
of the structural adjustment in Mexico greatly expanded the need to retrain those workers, and the&#13;
program was later supported by the Bank through the Manpower Training Project (Loan 2876-&#13;
ME) in 1987 with expanded scope and coverage. Since then, the program has provided short-&#13;
term vocational training to over 250,000 unemployed workers, approximately 50,000 trainees per&#13;
year. The PROBECAT program, administered through the network of state employment offices,&#13;
offers training allowances equivalent to one minimum wage to unemployed workers who enter a&#13;
retraining program. The allowances are paid for the duration of the course which varies from one&#13;
to six months, with the majority lasting three months. The program was originally designed for&#13;
displaced workers, but in practice, some 40% of the participants were unemployed workers who&#13;
sought job for the first time without prior work experience.&#13;
10.   To provide information on the effectiveness of the PROBECAT program as a basis for&#13;
policy decision making whether to continue with the program for a longer period than originally&#13;
intended, a rigorous evaluation of the impact of PROBECAT on the employment and earnings of&#13;
the program participants was conducted as a part of the project. The study evaluated the post-&#13;
training labor market experiences of the 1990 cohort of PROBECAT trainees, using new&#13;
longitudinal data developed for this purpose. A matched sample of unemployed workers from the&#13;
1990-91 quarterly urban labor force surveys (ENEU) was also developed as a control group.&#13;
Unlike previous evaluation studies of retraining programs, this study corrects for potential biases&#13;
in the estimates of effectiveness by using an appropriate control group and an estimation method&#13;
which takes into account the nonrandomness of workers accepted for the program.&#13;
11.   Prior (1992) Evaluation: The first evaluation study of the PROBECAT program was&#13;
conducted in 1992 to obtain information on the effectiveness of the program as a basis for the&#13;
policy decision whether to continue the program.  The results of the study showed that&#13;
PROBECAT program was effective in improving employability and earnings of certain groups of&#13;
trainees. More specifically, for male trainees of 25 years and older with prior work experience,&#13;
benefits of the program participation outweighed the costs within 2 months of completing the&#13;
program. For all other male trainees with prior work experience, the benefits paid for itself within&#13;
one year. However, for male with no prior work experience, the costs of training were offset only&#13;
after 17 months. For women, the costs of training were offset by benefits only for those who&#13;
were older than 25 years with prior work experience. The costs exceeded the benefits for other&#13;
women.&#13;
12.   According to the findings of the 1992 evaluation study, the selection criteria of the&#13;
program were modified. The second follow-up evaluation of the PROBECAT program was&#13;
conducted in 1994 for the cohort of 1993 trainees. The findings of the second evaluation study&#13;
are summarized below and in Tables 1 to 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                               ANNEX 6&#13;
PROSSE Economic Analysis&#13;
13.   Time to Find a Job. The probability of finding a job during the follow-up period is&#13;
significantly higher for PROBECAT participants than for the control group, which is a matched&#13;
sample of unemployed workers from National Urban Employment Survey. The mean duration of&#13;
job search is shorter for PROBECAT participants than for the control group (Tables 1 and 2, first&#13;
column). Participation in the program reduces time to find a job by about 55%. Although work&#13;
experience prior to becoming unemployed does not significantly affect the time to find&#13;
employment, the length of unemployment has a significant effect. Those unemployed for a short&#13;
period need significantly shorter time to find a job than those unemployed for a long period.&#13;
Among the two course modalities offered through the PROBECAT program, "School-based"&#13;
courses have weaker impact on time to find a job than "mixed" courses where trainees receive&#13;
hands-on training at work places mixed with class room training. For men, the difference between&#13;
the "mixed" courses participants and the control group was 2.5 months, whereas the difference&#13;
between the "school-based" courses participants and the control was only 0.5 months. For&#13;
women, the corresponding differences are 3.7 months and 1.6 months respectively. Years of&#13;
general education completed do not have any significant effect on the time to find job, whereas&#13;
the age of the unemployed was significant in the case of men.&#13;
14.   When we exclude the duration of training courses in the job-search period, the only group&#13;
which required longer time to find a job than the control group was male participants of "school-&#13;
based" courses aged 25 years and younger and without prior work experience. It should be noted&#13;
that those who received "school-based" training without prior work experience were selected&#13;
incorrectly according to the selection criteria of the PROBECAT program. For men, the result&#13;
above confirms that this group should only be directed to the "mixed" courses. However, for&#13;
women, participants of "school-based" courses without prior work experience also gained from&#13;
the program, as they experienced shorter time to find a job than the control group by 3.4 months&#13;
for those older than 25 years and by 2.1 months for 25 years or younger trainees.&#13;
15.   Monthly earnings. The PROBECAT program participation has positive impact for ten&#13;
out of the twelve categories of trainees considered, which represent 95.5% of the total program&#13;
participants (Tables 1 and 2, last column). The highest impact on the monthly earnings was&#13;
achieved for the participants of "mixed" courses, due to their high "employability" (i.e. shorter&#13;
time to find a job). The two groups of program participants whose monthly earnings were less&#13;
then those of the control group were: (i) men older than 25 years, who participated in "mixed"&#13;
courses without prior work experience; and (ii) men 25 years and younger who participated in the&#13;
"school-based" courses without prior work experience.  Therefore, for the last group, the&#13;
program impact on both time to find a job and monthly earnings turned out to be negative&#13;
compared to the control group.&#13;
16.   Hourly Earnings.  PROBECAT program  participants, and particularly those who&#13;
received "mixed" training, worked longer weekly hours than the control group. The difference of&#13;
weekly hours of work between the "mixed" training participants and the "school-based" training&#13;
participants is substantially smaller than the difference between these two groups combined and&#13;
the control group. As a result of the longer hours of work for PROBECAT participants, the&#13;
order of hourly earnings among groups of men who obtained employment get reversed from the&#13;
ordering of the job-search duration: the control group invariably earn higher hourly earnings (1.8&#13;
&#13;

to 5.3 pesos per hour depending on age and prior work experience) than the PROBECAT&#13;
participants of "mixed" courses (1.7 to 4.9 pesos per hour). For women, hourly earnings are&#13;
higher for participants of "school-based" (1.3 to 6.2 pesos per hour) courses than either "mixed"&#13;
courses participants (1.2 to 6.0 pesos per hour) or the control group.&#13;
17.   Cost and Benefit of the PROBECAT program. When we do not include the length of&#13;
training courses in the job search duration, the cost of the PROBECAT program can be&#13;
recuperated immediately upon completion of the program for all participants of "mixed" courses,&#13;
with the exception of men older than 25 years without prior work experience. For "school-based"&#13;
course participants, recuperation of the cost occurs either immediately or within 5 months for&#13;
most of the groups, except for women 25 years old or younger with long unemployment duration.&#13;
If we include the length of training courses in the time to find employment, the results continue to&#13;
favor the PROBECAT program participants, particularly those who participate in'the "mixed"&#13;
courses. For this group, the cost of the program is recuperated within the first five months,&#13;
except for men younger then 25 years old with long unemployment duration. For the participants&#13;
of "school-based" courses, the recuperation of the cost takes mostly between one and two years.&#13;
18.   While the PROBECAT program as a whole was found to have high returns, the "mixed"&#13;
training has been shown to have higher returns than the "school-based" training. This finding&#13;
supports a recommendation to direct the PROBECAT program more toward courses which are&#13;
directly linked to productive activities, either through hands-on training in enterprises or through&#13;
community projects such as public works programs designed under the PROBECAT sub-program&#13;
of the proposed program.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Program of Essential Social Services
            (PROSSE) Project has three objectives, to: 1) protect
            essential social services for the poor, through the
            provision of textbooks to all students, and on a targeted
            basis, teaching materials, maintaining access to pre-school,
            primary and lower secondary education in isolated rural
            areas, provision of a basic health care package, vaccines,
            pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and community health
            outreach campaigns to the uninsured population; b)
            strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion
            the poor from the effects of the economic crisis through
