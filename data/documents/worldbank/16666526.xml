large-scale and sustained increases in Handwashing with soap at critical times among the poor and&#13;
vulnerable in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
During the first year of the project, baseline enabling environment assessments were conducted in&#13;
the four target countries to better understand the programmatic and institutional conditions needed&#13;
to scale up, sustain, and replicate the interventions used in the projects. The assessments will be&#13;
repeated after three years of project implementation to assess progress in strengthening the enabling&#13;
environment and to determine more definitive lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this report is to synthesize the findings from the four enabling environment&#13;
assessment reports, including preliminary conclusions and lessons learned as well as recommended&#13;
interventions and practices that can be used to strengthen the enabling environment. The report also&#13;
identifies knowledge gaps and, hence, priority areas for learning.&#13;
&#13;
This report and the findings from the four assessments should be seen as a work in progress that&#13;
will be enhanced with additional lessons learned and insights as the Global Scaling-Up&#13;
Handwashing projects move forward in each country.&#13;
&#13;
FINDINGS&#13;
The enabling environment assessments were conducted using a common conceptual framework&#13;
consisting of the following nine dimensions.&#13;

&#13;
The definition of each dimension, as well as specific findings and recommendations from the four&#13;
enabling environment assessment reports, are provided in the third section of this report.&#13;
&#13;
The overall conclusions from the analysis of the four reports are the following:&#13;
â&#128;¢ The enabling environment in all countries to create and sustain large-scale Handwashing&#13;
   programs is not yet in place. The enabling environment in Peru appears to be the most&#13;
   developed of the four countries.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Although some countries have issued ministerial decrees that support Handwashing, none of&#13;
   the assessments stated that a comprehensive national policy framework is in place and, further,&#13;
   that it has translated into sustained action.&#13;
â&#128;¢ National-level partnerships have been formed but not all are yet functioning effectively.&#13;
â&#128;¢ With increased decentralization, all the reports highlighted the importance of working through&#13;
   regional and local governments to achieve scale-up and sustainability.&#13;
â&#128;¢ The assessment reports emphasized the importance of adapting the public-private partnership&#13;
   for Handwashing (PPPHW) methodology to the specific context of each country to ensure&#13;
   ownership.&#13;
â&#128;¢ The availability of soap does not appear generally to be problematic, with the exception of&#13;
   some remote areas.&#13;
â&#128;¢ To date, country programs have relied primarily on external funding and have not addressed the&#13;
   long-term challenge of securing funding for a Handwashing program at scale.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Systems for tracking costs to determine the most cost-effective implementation are not yet in&#13;
   place.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Similarly, although capacity for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) exists in most countries,&#13;
   systems have not yet been established.&#13;
&#13;
LEARNING AGENDA&#13;
The Scaling Up Handwashing Behavior Change Program places great emphasis on learning from&#13;
the four country programs. The analysis and preliminary recommendations suggest a number of&#13;
knowledge gaps in HWWS programs that are elements of scaled up and sustainable Handwashing&#13;
programs. The synthesis report provides the following specific suggestions for a learning agenda&#13;
for the strengthening of the enabling environment:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Documenting the process used to develop national partnerships to identify lessons learned&#13;
â&#128;¢ Developing case studies on how to establish linkages between Handwashing and other&#13;
     programs such as nutrition, water and sanitation, and schools&#13;
â&#128;¢ Involving local government in training, planning and budgeting, and M&amp;E&#13;
â&#128;¢ Developing guidance on the appropriate balance between mass media and interpersonal&#13;
     communication&#13;
&#13;

Policy, Strategy, â&#128;¢ Gaining high-level support will benefit from an advocacy&#13;
and Direction       campaign aimed at decision makers. Advocacy is also&#13;
                    important in creating legitimacy for Handwashing as a health&#13;
                    intervention.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Each country program should work toward the development&#13;
                    of a national policy on Handwashing, such as the ministerial&#13;
                    decree issued in Peru by the MOH. Such a policy is a&#13;
                    precondition for making available national government&#13;
                    budgetary resources.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Link with other national programs to the extent possible. In&#13;
                    general, linkages with the ministries responsible for education&#13;
                    and water seem especially important, given the importance of&#13;
                    school-based programs and access to water and sanitation&#13;
                    facilities.&#13;
Partnerships      â&#128;¢ Seek outside help in building the partnership through a skilled&#13;
                    organizational development or partnership facilitation expert.&#13;
                    There is a body of knowledge on how to build effective&#13;
                    partnerships that can be tapped into that would address many&#13;
                    of the deficiencies identified in the assessment reports.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Develop a formal partnership agreement that clarifies the roles&#13;
                    and responsibilities of each partner and a way to monitor the&#13;
                    implementation of the agreements.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Partnerships require institutionally based leadership.&#13;
                    Experience to date seems to indicate that this leadership&#13;
                    should come from the lead national agency.&#13;
Institutional     â&#128;¢ Identification of a ministerial home and staffing it should&#13;
Arrangements        occur as early in the program as possible in order to use the&#13;
                    Scaling Up Handwashing Behavior Change Program as an&#13;
                    opportunity for building capacity.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Clarify, in broad terms, a framework for the roles and&#13;
                    responsibilities of all categories of partners for&#13;
                    implementation. There appears to be general agreement that&#13;
                    central ministries have a normative role and provide program&#13;
                    guidance; districts have lead implementation responsibility;&#13;
                    NGOs carry out special enabling functions such as advocacy&#13;
                    and capacity building; and the private sector provides&#13;
                    financing and marketing, and makes available Handwashing&#13;
                    products.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢ Coordination mechanisms at both the national and local levels&#13;
                    need to be established to ensure interagency and intersectoral&#13;
                    coordination. This could occur through existing interagency&#13;
                    mechanisms, as in Tanzania, or possibly tapping into fully&#13;
                    functioning partnerships such as the Rural Water Supply and&#13;

                      â&#128;¢ Each country program should actively seek to identify&#13;
                        opportunities for integration of Handwashing into other&#13;

                              recommends, the approach should be one based on the&#13;
                              training of trainers and systematic follow-up after the&#13;
                              training has taken place.&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Systems and procedures should be developed as part of&#13;
                              the approach to strengthening implementation capacity.&#13;
Availability of           â&#128;¢ Each country should develop a plan for ensuring the&#13;
Products and                  availability of key products and toolsâ&#128;&#148;soap,&#13;
Tools                         Handwashing facilities, and materials.&#13;
Financing                 â&#128;¢ Each country should develop a financial plan for&#13;
                              sustainability and scale-up that includes donors, the&#13;
                              private sector, and national government sources.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢ Scale-up is unlikely to occur without a process to involve&#13;
                              regional and district governments, since the responsibility&#13;
                              for planning and budgeting is increasingly the&#13;
                              responsibility of local government.&#13;
                          â&#128;¢ Affordability for a scaled-up program cannot really be&#13;
                              determined unless subsidies are removed.&#13;
Cost-Effective           â&#128;¢ Systems need to be set up to track implementation costs&#13;
Implementation                or the follow-up assessment in three years will not be&#13;

Handwashing programs. This section&#13;
provides specific suggestions for a       3. Involving local government in&#13;
learning agenda for WSP for                  training, planning and&#13;
strengthening the enabling                   budgeting, and M&amp;E. Another&#13;
environment. The items in the learning       recurring theme in all the&#13;
agenda are intended to better inform         countries is the importance of&#13;
the creation of an enabling                  involving local government in&#13;
environment for Handwashing                  implementation. None of the&#13;
programs at scale. WSP should ensure         assessment reports provided&#13;
that the knowledge products suggested        much information on how this&#13;
below are used to further learning           experience has worked to date&#13;
about strengthening the enabling             and what has been learned. For&#13;
environment for Handwashing.                 the most part, the&#13;
                                             recommendations were&#13;
    1. Documenting the process used          prospective, which means there&#13;
       to develop national                   is much to learn as&#13;
       partnerships. One of the              Handwashing initiatives&#13;
       common themes in this report          increasingly work with local&#13;
       is the need to pay focused            governments.&#13;
       attention to how to develop an&#13;
       effective national partnership.    4. Guidance on the use of mass&#13;
       Peru appears to have the              media versus interpersonal&#13;
       strongest national partnership        communication. The&#13;
       of the four countries, but there      assessment reports indicate that&#13;
       is relatively little information      this remains a somewhat&#13;
       in the report on the steps that       unresolved methodological&#13;
       were taken to build the               issue. The question is whether&#13;
       partnership and the lessons that      a program that uses extensive&#13;
       were learned.                         interpersonal communication&#13;
                                             can be scaled up efficiently.&#13;
    2. Case studies on how to                Because partners in countries&#13;
       establish linkages with other         such as Senegal and Tanzania&#13;

       the conclusions of this report is       WSP could provide standard&#13;
       that the use of existing                templates with line items and&#13;
       operational structures, often           cost factors.&#13;
       government staff, is one of the&#13;
       key strategies for scaling up.       8. Developing standard M&amp;E&#13;
       Which operational structures            indicators. Several of the&#13;
       have been used? What was                assessment reports stated that&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            recently completed the first year of a four-year Global
            Scaling Up Handwashing Project. This project tests whether
            innovative approaches can generate large-scale and sustained
            increases in handwashing with soap (HWWS) at critical times
            among the poor and vulnerable in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania,
            and Vietnam. During the first year of the project, baseline
            enabling environment assessments were conducted in the four
            target countries to better understand the programmatic and
            institutional conditions needed to scale up, sustain, and
            replicate the interventions used in the projects. The
            assessments will be repeated after three years of project
            implementation to assess progress in strengthening the
            enabling environment and to determine more definitive
            lessons learned. The purpose of this report is to synthesize
            the findings from the four enabling environment assessment
            reports, including preliminary conclusions and lessons
            learned as well as recommended interventions and practices
            that can be used to strengthen the enabling environment. The
            report also identifies knowledge gaps and, hence, priority
            areas for learning. This report and the findings from the
            four assessments should be seen as a work in progress that
            will be enhanced with additional lessons learned and
            insights as the Global Scaling-Up Handwashing projects move
            forward in each country.
