&amp;#12;&#13;
REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:      The Republic of Ghana&#13;
Beneficiaries:   Village Communities, Farrner Associations, District Assemblies, and NGOs;&#13;
the Ministries of Food and Agriculture, and Local Government and Rural&#13;
Development.&#13;
Amount:         SDR 20.8 million (US$30.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:          Standard with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:    The project would support the efforts of the Government of Ghana to reduce&#13;
poverty and increase the quality of life of the rural poor through increased&#13;
transfer of technical and financial resources for the development of basic&#13;
village-level infrastructure that can be sustained by beneficiaries. The project&#13;
would also support capacity building of District Assemblies to better plan and&#13;
manage these investments and would empower rural beneficiary groups and&#13;
associations through training and other forms of technical assistance that&#13;
would enable them to sustainably operate and maintain these investments at&#13;
the community level.&#13;
Project        In support of these objectives, the project would have the following&#13;
Description:    components:&#13;
(a) Rural Water Infrastructure. The project would support the integrated&#13;
development and management of water resources, including catchment&#13;
management and other water conservation practices, and investments for the&#13;
rational use of water for agriculture, livestock and human consumption&#13;
including small dams, dugouts, boreholes, hand-dug wells, streamflow&#13;
diversion and pumping to support small-scale irrigation in the dry season, and&#13;
rainfall conservation and management for more effective use in rainfed crop&#13;
production.&#13;
(b) Rural Transport Infrastructure. The project would support selective&#13;
rehabilitation and spot improvements of degraded feeder roads, the&#13;
development of village trails and tracks (VTTs) linking farms to villages that&#13;
would permit the use of simple wheeled vehicles for reducing the drudgery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-_j-&#13;
from head porterage (a task performed mainly by women and children), and a&#13;
pilot program to develop intermediate means of transport (IMTs) for the rural&#13;
poor to increase the efficiency of evacuating produce from farms to villages&#13;
and onwards to markets.&#13;
(c) Rural Post-Harvest Infrastructure.  The project would support the&#13;
development of on-farm and village-level drying facilities to reduce post-&#13;
harvest losses, on-farm and community storage and other village-level market&#13;
infrastructure for more efficient marketing of produce, appropriate facilities&#13;
for processing of crops, livestock and fisheries products to increase their&#13;
quality shelflife and market value, and income-generating activities targeted at&#13;
the poorest segments of the rural population to enable them to enhance their&#13;
incomes.&#13;
(d) Institutional Strengthening. The project would support capacity building&#13;
within District Assemblies (DAs) to strengthen their planning and financial&#13;
management of rural infrastructure; strengthen NGOs and other community-&#13;
based organizations (CBOs) to provide more effective implementation support&#13;
to beneficiary communities and groups in developing sustainable rural&#13;
infrastructure; and empower beneficiary associations and groups to take direct&#13;
responsibility for the sustainable operations and maintenance of rural&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
Project Benefits: Main project benefits would be: (i) increased smallholder productivity,&#13;
employment and rural incomes; (ii) strengthened community institutions to&#13;
participate more effectively in rural development; and (iii) improved&#13;
community health and nutritional status. All of these benefits would help to&#13;
reduce rural poverty, provide development and integration of the rural&#13;
economy, and improve the overall quality of rural life.&#13;
Project Risks:   Major project risks are: (i) slow development of capacity of DAs and farmer&#13;
organizations, which may affect implementation performance; (ii) inadequate&#13;
coordination among various partners in rural development; and (iii) slow&#13;
adoption of new technologies. These risks are evaluated in the report and&#13;
mitigation measures have been incorporated in the project design to reduce&#13;
their likelihood.&#13;
Poverty&#13;
Alleviation:     The project has a high poverty alleviation objective. It is targeted at poor&#13;
farmers, rural communities and District Assemblies. At least 500,000 rural&#13;
families would benefit directly from the project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Ghana's efforts at macroeconomic reforms over the past decade have been relatively&#13;
successful. In the ten years since its inception, the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) has&#13;
produced an average annual GDP growth rate of nearly 5 percent for the economy as a whole.&#13;
The early stages of the ERP were focused on structural reforms, and progress has been good on&#13;
several fronts. Specifically in the agricultural sector, the reforms have led to the elimination of&#13;
most government monopolies, especially in the seed subsector, the liberalization of inputs and&#13;
output prices, and improvement in the legislative and regulatory framework. These reforms have&#13;
also contributed to the creation of a more competitive environment for private sector&#13;
involvement in agricultural development.&#13;
1.2   However, measured by their impact on improving rural living standards, the economic&#13;
reforms have been less successful. The agricultural sector, which accounts for more than&#13;
45 percent of GDP, has grown only at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent over the last five&#13;
years, compared to a population growth rate of around 3 percent. Poverty remains high in rural&#13;
areas in spite of over ten years of economic reforms. A recent study, the Participatory Poverty&#13;
Assessment (PPA), revealed that nearly 54 percent of Ghana's poor are food crop farmers who&#13;
derive primary income from farming and other farm-based activities. Given the strong link&#13;
between agriculture and rural poverty, sustainably reducing the incidence of rural poverty would&#13;
require strong, sustained and broad-based agriculture sector growth.&#13;
1.3   Achieving broad-based agriculture growth in Ghana, however, will require not only on-&#13;
farm productivity increases but also removing the existing off-farm constraints, including&#13;
inadequate post-harvest processing, storage, drying and internal transport. In rural Ghana, access&#13;
to markets is a severe constraint for most farmers as feeder and access roads are in poor&#13;
conditions, with only a small percentage passable year-round. Transport constraints, when&#13;
combined with the inherent low capacity of on-farm storage and processing, result in high post-&#13;
harvest losses. It is estimated that farmers lose nearly a third of their output during the post-&#13;
production phases. Rural marketing systems are also underdeveloped and market information is&#13;
rudimentary and unreliable, with weak linkages existing between agriculture and the increasingly&#13;
important industrial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.   THE ECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
2.1   Following eight years of sustained fiscal adjustment and falling inflation since the start of&#13;
the ERP in 1983, Ghana's fiscal performance received a setback during the run-up to the 1992&#13;
general elections and has remained fragile since then. Expenditure over-runs have resulted in&#13;
large fiscal deficits and rising inflation. Though divestiture receipts helped to finance the excess&#13;
expenditures in most of these years, the impact on inflation and public debt was unavoidable. On&#13;
a year-end basis, inflation rose from 10 percent in end-1992 to 71 percent in end-1995 and&#13;
interest obligations rose from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1992 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 1995. The&#13;
latter was due to the growth in domestic debt and in Bank of Ghana's open market operations as&#13;
well as the rising nominal interest rate. Since 1994, the Government has had to borrow&#13;
domestically to service part of the interest bill which is an unsustainable situation.&#13;
2.2  In the face of rising inflation and balance of payments pressures, the Government entered&#13;
into a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) with the IMF in June 1995.&#13;
The first year of the ESAF was completed in June 1996. However, large fiscal slippages, mostly&#13;
in the second half of the year, have delayed the start of the second year of the ESAF which is&#13;
now likely to be negotiated by the end of 1997 upon the implementation of several upfront&#13;
measures. The narrow fiscal deficit in 1996 was 3.2 percent of GDP compared to the program&#13;
target of a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP. This was primarily due to over-runs in development&#13;
expenditures and in non-interest recurrent expenditures. In addition, shortfalls in revenues from&#13;
import taxes, excise taxes on petroleum, and non-tax sources also contributed to the slippage.&#13;
Interest obligations increased to 5.6 percent of GDP and the Government's domestic borrowing&#13;
was equivalent to 5.1 percent of GDP.&#13;
Recent Economic Developments&#13;
2.3   Notwithstanding the large fiscal slippages, the economic out-turn in 1996 was favorable.&#13;
Real GDP grew by 5.2 percent largely on account of agricultural growth of 4 percent. Inflation&#13;
fell from 71 percent at the end of 1995 to 32 percent at the end of 1996. This was due, in part, to&#13;
the lagged effects of fiscal and monetary restraint in the first half of 1996 and, in part, to lower&#13;
cost-push factors emanating from a good harvest, postponed adjustments in petroleum and power&#13;
tariffs, and lower nominal depreciation of the Cedi due to foreign exchange market interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
B.    THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
Sector Characteristics&#13;
2.4   Agriculture is the mainstay of the Ghanaian economy, accounting for 45 percent of GDP,&#13;
60 percent of export earnings and employing an estimated 70 percent of the rural labor force.&#13;
However, agriculture is small-scale, characterized by low input, low output technologies.&#13;
Farming systems are predominantly of the traditional bush-fallow system, with relatively few&#13;
purchased inputs being used -- fertilizer imports have only been between 20,000 and 25,000&#13;
metric tons each year during the last 4 years. About 5.3 million ha, or 22 percent of Ghana's&#13;
arable land area, were estimated to be under cultivation in 1995. Total area planted to the major&#13;
food crops was 2.2 million ha, comprising of maize (28 percent of the total planted area), cassava&#13;
(23 percent), and sorghum and millet (22 percent). Food crops, livestock and fisheries together&#13;
account for 75 percent of agricultural GDP; non-food crops, notably cocoa and forestry, account&#13;
for the remaining 25 percent. Ghanaian agriculture is largely based on smallholder farms.&#13;
Although there are some large farms, particularly for plantation crops such as rubber, oil palm&#13;
and cocoa, about 60 percent of all farms in Ghana are less than 1.2 ha, 25 percent are between 1.2&#13;
to 2 ha, and only 15 percent are over 2 ha in size.&#13;
2.5   These salient features of Ghanaian agriculture -- high employment, a large contribution to&#13;
economic output dominated by smallholders, and significant untapped potential -- make it a&#13;
strong potential vehicle for inducing high and equitable growth leading to poverty reduction.&#13;
However, agriculture's contribution to overall economic growth and poverty alleviation has been&#13;
below expectations during the last decade. The slow growth in agriculture is due to a&#13;
combination of factors that reduce farmers' incentives to invest and produce. These include the&#13;
high taxation of agriculture through explicit (export tax on cocoa) and implicit (parastatal&#13;
inefficiencies) taxation, and severely constrained access to input and output markets due to the&#13;
poor conditions of rural infrastructure. The later constraint has led to the relative isolation of&#13;
rural communities from markets and to high post-harvest losses. Given that only about 8,000 km&#13;
of the total 22,000 km of feeder roads are classified within the maintainable network, significant&#13;
drudgery is imposed on rural dwellers, especially women and children, who must headload&#13;
produce from fields to the villages, and onwards, to local markets. The poor state of rural roads&#13;
presents a massive impediment to the spread of modern farm inputs and improved technology,&#13;
and also to farmers' incentives to produce for the market, intensify production and diversify their&#13;
farming activities. On-farm/rural labor productivity is also severely constrained by inadequate&#13;
access to clean water which requires women to spend considerable time to secure the water&#13;
necessary for household uses, an activity which also has a negative impact on their health.&#13;
Agriculture, Poverty and Rural Infrastructure&#13;
2.6   The profile of poverty in Ghana shows that it is largely rural and agricultural: 54 percent&#13;
of those living in poverty are food crop farmers. Poverty also has a strong regional bias, linked&#13;
to the relative natural resource endowment (climate, water, good soils and vegetation) of the&#13;
three main agro-ecological zones of the country. Both the incidence and depth of poverty are&#13;
found to be greater in the rural savannah than in any other parts of Ghana, but major pockets of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
poverty also exist in the forest zone, the coastal belt, and in large urban centers such as Accra and&#13;
Kumasi. Gender is also an important dimension of poverty, especially in northern Ghana, where&#13;
sharp distinctions between the income-earning roles of men and women exist. Women also bear&#13;
a disproportionate share of the burden of being poor -- they are obliged to spend a great deal of&#13;
time not only at working in family enterprises, but also nurturing and rearing children, and&#13;
performing other important household tasks, such as cooking and fetching water and firewood.&#13;
These factors have strong implications for poverty targeting interventions (PTIs), not only on the&#13;
basis of geography, but also on gender.&#13;
2.7    Given the strong links between the poor state of rural infrastructure and rural poverty,&#13;
improving basic rural infrastructure on which the rural poor depend can act as a catalyst in&#13;
accelerating rural development. For example, improvement in rural access roads lead to reduced&#13;
transport costs, increased access to markets and market information, and lowered post-harvest&#13;
losses. These, in turn, increase profitability and spur expansion in agricultural output. Increased&#13;
market access not only enhances rural farm incomes, but also empowers rural people to better&#13;
manage the risks associated with rainfed agriculture through crop diversification and better off-&#13;
farm employment opportunities. When investment in rural transport infrastructure is linked to&#13;
complementary facilities such as rural water supply and village storage, important synergies&#13;
result that lead to significant multiplier effects in rural communities: improved health enables&#13;
the poor to engage in productive activities such as farming, which in turn increase incomes and&#13;
food security. One of the main issues associated with rural infrastructure is its maintenance. The&#13;
sustainability of rural infrastructure development depends, to a large extent, on the level of&#13;
community ownership, beginning with their active participation in planning, developing,&#13;
prioritizing and implementing rural development programs, and culminating with their&#13;
assumption of direct responsibility for operations and management. Proposing sustainable&#13;
solutions to these issues is the basic objective of this operation.&#13;
2.8    Rural Water Infrastructure. While Ghana has an abundance of water from rainfall, this&#13;
resource is very unevenly distributed both geographically and seasonally. Even in the high&#13;
rainfall (over 1500 mm per annum) belt in the south and west of the country, water can be scarce&#13;
in the dry season which lasts three to five months. In the northern and the southeast regions,&#13;
annual rainfall is normally less than 1,500 mm, and in some areas below 500 mm, with the dry&#13;
season spreading over eight to nine continuous months. In much of the drier regions, a large part&#13;
of villagers' time, particularly of women and children, is occupied in collecting water from&#13;
distant and often unsafe sources. This takes away a substantial amount of time from other&#13;
gainful activities. Only an estimated 35 percent of rural communities presently have continuous&#13;
and easy access to safe potable water. Scarcity of potable water increases the risk of water-borne&#13;
diseases and has a very negative impact on labor availability and productivity. Provision of safe&#13;
water and good sanitation in the rural areas is high among the rural development priorities of&#13;
government. Recent client consultations among rural communities also indicate that the most&#13;
pressing demands in the northern drier half of the country are for safe and reliable supplies of&#13;
water. Even in the higher rainfall areas, the need for water is high among the priorities of rural&#13;
communities particularly for intensification of valley bottom cultivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
2.9   The scarcity of water, particularly in the low rainfall areas, is also a major limiting factor&#13;
to crop and animal production. The rainfall in the drier parts of the country could be more&#13;
effectively utilized for intensifying the production of crops and livestock. This would involve&#13;
appropriate water conservation practices, such as storage in accessible aquifers and in simple&#13;
surface storage facilities such as ponds, tanks, dugouts and small reservoirs for use in the dry&#13;
months. In addition, free flowing seasonal springs and streams could be important sources for&#13;
supplemental irrigation in the rainfall months or for diverting to storage facilities for later use&#13;
during the drier months. There are also good prospects for making better use of water in the&#13;
higher rainfall zones for producing high value crops and livestock, and for fish culture to&#13;
improve incomes and nutrition of the populations.&#13;
2.10  Coastal Zone Degradation. The districts of Ghana's coastal zone represent only about&#13;
6.5 percent of the total land area of the country, yet these districts are home to 25 percent of the&#13;
nation's population. Environmental degradation in the coastal areas has been identified as a&#13;
major issue in Ghana's National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). Poverty is also extensive&#13;
along Ghana's coast. Average welfare levels among food farmers in rural coastal areas, as&#13;
estimated by the Ghana Poverty Assessment, are 12 percent below the national average, and&#13;
about 38 percent below that in urban centers. Complex interlinkages exist between the resource&#13;
base of coastal areas and the communities that subsist on these natural resources. Conflicts of&#13;
resource use often lead to ecosystem degradation and deteriorating health in communities.&#13;
Coupled with ailing health, the poverty and environmental degradation contribute to a vicious&#13;
circle that inhibits socio-economic development in coastal areas. The lack of sanitation and&#13;
waste disposal facilities leads to large amounts of waste being dumped directly into the ocean,&#13;
left in piles on the beaches or dumped directly into lagoons causing the destruction of mangroves&#13;
and coastal wetlands which have important economic and ecological uses. These wetlands&#13;
provide valuable habitat to migrating birds, serve as spawning grounds for shrimp, lobster and&#13;
other commercially important fisheries and also prevent flooding by absorbing excess waste&#13;
water and runoffs. Fish smoking activities and lack of sanitation and waste disposal facilities in&#13;
overcrowded coastal settlements pose a health hazard to the communities living in them and&#13;
significantly limit the tourist potential of these areas.&#13;
2.11  Rural Transport Infrastructure. In addition to low coverage, two-thirds of Ghana's&#13;
feeder road network are in poor conditions due to past neglect. Good rural roads are essential for&#13;
achieving increases in agricultural production, especially in non-food export crops, which in turn,&#13;
can lead to expanded use of agricultural credit, increases in land values, proliferation of traders&#13;
and small shops, and expansion of rural markets. Improvements in rural transport infrastructure&#13;
benefit the rural poor in two distinct ways: (i) directly, by generating employment through labor-&#13;
intensive construction and maintenance programs; and (ii) indirectly, by reducing the cost of&#13;
transport for goods and passengers. Since the rural poor tend to be small farmers or landless&#13;
laborers, they benefit, along with the rural population at large, from better roads to the extent that&#13;
roads decrease the cost of agricultural inputs and/or essential consumer goods within the village,&#13;
or expand the labor market and increase the demand for unskilled labor. However, the extent to&#13;
which the poor would benefit from rural roads to increase their access to output markets or&#13;
economic and social services would be enhanced if they have access to affordable means of&#13;
transport. The need therefore is not only for transport to link larger communities and markets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
but also for appropriate and cost-effective means of getting produce from farms to villages,&#13;
including the use of non-motorized wheeled vehicles.&#13;
2.12 Postharvest Management. The inadequate levels of post-harvest facilities in Ghana&#13;
provide a major bottleneck to any strategy aimed at accelerating agricultural growth. Many&#13;
small fanners, particularly the poorer ones, are invariably forced to dispose of their produce&#13;
immediately after harvest to meet urgent cash needs and reduce losses of highly perishable crops&#13;
such as vegetables. It is estimated that losses due to pests and other forms of spoilage averages&#13;
around 30 percent of the harvest. The impact on the poor of such high losses could be&#13;
considerably reduced (to less than 5 percent) if improved post-harvest handling and processing&#13;
techniques were adopted on farms and at village level.&#13;
2.13  Opportunities readily exist for small farmers and rural communities to reduce post-&#13;
harvest losses and substantially increase the benefits from their crop, livestock and fish products.&#13;
These include primary processing such as cleaning, smoking, drying, sorting, grading and&#13;
storage, and secondary processing such as grating, frying, roasting, milling, extracting, juicing,&#13;
fermenting and packaging, which further increase earnings by adding value to the intermediate&#13;
products. Most of these techniques are simple in concept, appropriate in use, and easy to&#13;
transfer. Also, evidence points to the fact that low level financial interventions do lead to&#13;
significant improvements in incomes of the poorest of the poor. Local experience has shown that&#13;
incomes of target groups could be doubled within two years of the adoption of improved&#13;
practices and, in many instances, increases could be considerably larger. The secondary benefits&#13;
arising from increased incomes for poor farmers can also be substantial, especially on housing,&#13;
sanitation and health, and education, all of which further enhance rural populations' capacity for&#13;
generating and sustaining higher incomes from other economic activities.&#13;
Decentralization and Local Empowerment&#13;
2.14  In Ghana, decentralization  has involved the devolution of considerable fiscal,&#13;
administrative, and development responsibilities to all 110 District Assemblies (DAs). In&#13;
addition, each District Assembly has a Common Fund to which the central government cedes a&#13;
portion of the total national revenue for development purposes. For 1996, the total amount ceded&#13;
to all DAs was Cedis 82 billion (about US$41 million), averaging US$372,000 per District.&#13;
Each DA also prepares a five-year District Development Plan to prioritize rural development.&#13;
While the principle of decentralization is now well advanced in Ghana, in practice, its progress&#13;
has been affected by many factors, including the following: (i) the reluctance of sector ministries&#13;
to devolve part of their authority to the districts; (ii) the lack of qualified and experienced staff&#13;
within many DAs, and (iii) poor logistics and lack of capacity for planning rural development at&#13;
the District-level. In addition to lack of equipment and transport, many DAs lack the capacity to&#13;
effectively support development programs because of inadequate skills in participatory&#13;
development planning, project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
2.15 Ministry of Food and Agriculture. During the past two years, the strategy of the&#13;
Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), the government's agency responsible for the crop,&#13;
livestock and fisheries subsectors, has been to develop local capacity as the key to achieving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
broad-based and sustainable agricultural growth.  In this respect, MOFA has appointed&#13;
agricultural coordinators to all the 1 l 0Districts as part of the decentralization process, as well as&#13;
district agricultural advisory committees, comprising representatives of farmers and other&#13;
community-based organizations, to participate in the fornulation and preparation of the five-year&#13;
District Development Plans. MOFA's efforts to enhance grassroots capability is consistent with&#13;
the government's national development strategy as embodied in its Vision 2020. Recent sector&#13;
work on Rural Institutions, undertaken by MOFA (with IDA assistance), has contributed to&#13;
better understanding the nature and role of grassroots institutions in rural development, and&#13;
helped to develop specific strategies for strengthening them.&#13;
C.    IDA COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
2.16  IDA assistance strategy in Ghana supports the efforts of the government to reduce&#13;
poverty through rapid and shared economic growth and human resource development. The core&#13;
of the IDA assistance program are rural development, macroeconomic stability, and human&#13;
resource development. This assistance has five medium-term goals. The first is to help the&#13;
government to redefine its poverty reduction strategy and to develop a gender strategy. During&#13;
the last year, the government designed a National Action Program for poverty reduction, and&#13;
established a Poverty Task Force to implement the program. IDA's involvement in this task has&#13;
been limited to advising on priorities and assisting in developing a set of action plans, including&#13;
a national system for poverty monitoring. IDA is also assisting the government in the&#13;
fornulation of a gender strategy, for which GOG provided a special line of credit of one billion&#13;
Cedis in its 1995 budget. The second area of IDA assistance is in stabilizing the macroeconomy,&#13;
and reducing inflation in order to create a better environment for investments and growth. IDA,&#13;
in collaboration with the IMF, continues to provide assistance through non-lending instruments&#13;
and policy advice. The third focus of IDA assistance is capacity building, involving assistance&#13;
for civil service reforms and the strengthening of public sector institutions. The fourth pillar of&#13;
IDA assistance is private sector development, including support for the privatization of public&#13;
sector enterprises. In this context, IDA is also supporting the government's new initiative to&#13;
promote Ghana as the trade and investment gateway to West Africa. The fifth pillar of IDA&#13;
assistance is environmentally sustainable development, which includes support for the National&#13;
Environment Action Plan (NEAP), among other initiatives&#13;
D.   IFAD'S STRATEGY AND LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.17  To date, IFAD has financed six projects in Ghana, for a total loan amount of about&#13;
US$71 million. These projects focus mainly on agricultural development, with most of them&#13;
also including rural infrastructure components (feeder road rehabilitation, rural waters supply for&#13;
human, livestock and small-scale irrigation). Several operations are helping to strengthen rural&#13;
financial services to smallholder farmers, including women. The ongoing projects are located in&#13;
the northern half of the country because of the widespread and pervasive nature of poverty in this&#13;
agroecological zone. IFAD's present medium term strategy includes five major elements: (i)&#13;
focus on smallholder food production and food security and arresting environmental degradation;&#13;
(ii) promotion of farm and non-farm income generation; (iii) focus on poverty alleviation and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
means by which the poor can be reached more efficiently and effectively; (iv) provision of&#13;
specific support targeted at the rural poor, including women; and (v) close collaboration with&#13;
NGOs and institutional support to government agencies especially at district levels to support the&#13;
decentralization process. IFAD's strategy for assistance to Ghana aims at close collaboration and&#13;
partnership with major donors to ensure that the Fund's intervention is playing a catalytic role&#13;
and maximizing synergies with other donor programs of poverty alleviation.&#13;
E. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS&#13;
2.18   Since 1962, IBRD and IDA lending to Ghana has reached a total of US$3.5 billion, of&#13;
which IDA accounts for US$3.2 billion, with total disbursements about US$2.7 billion. The&#13;
current IDA portfolio consists of projects with undisbursed balance of nearly US$833 million.&#13;
Nine of these projects are in the agriculture sector. The most recent project in the sector, and the&#13;
last of the MTADS generation of projects, is the Fisheries Capacity Building Project&#13;
(US$21.5 million), which became effective in August 1995. The thrust of the agriculture sector&#13;
portfolio is to support basic services for agricultural production (Agricultural Extension,&#13;
Agricultural Research, Livestock and Fisheries), the diversification of agricultural sector&#13;
activities (Agricultural Diversification), the rehabilitation of the cocoa sector (Cocoa&#13;
Rehabilitation), the development of rural infrastructure (Agricultural Sector Investment Project),&#13;
and the improvement of natural resources and environmental management (Forestry and&#13;
Environment).&#13;
F.    RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.19  The recent Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) in Ghana estimates that one-fifth of&#13;
Ghana's population of 16.5 million live below the poverty line. The main constraints to&#13;
improving rural living standards have bee identified as the poor state (or non-existence) of basic&#13;
rural infrastructure (rural water supply, village post-harvest and rural transport infrastructure) on&#13;
which the poor depend to improve their livelihood and which is needed to unleash a rigorous&#13;
supply response from agriculture. Improving the quality of life of the rural population, therefore,&#13;
requires significant investments in these types of basic rural infrastructure and this would require&#13;
support of Ghana's partners in development, including, IDA. The Village Infrastructure Project,&#13;
which is fully consistent with the objectives of IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Ghana, would be a primary vehicle for rural development and poverty reduction. It would assist&#13;
rural beneficiaries to improve employment opportunities, have better access to basic services,&#13;
reduce post-harvest losses, improve the nutritional value of their produce, and increase value-&#13;
added through processing. It would increase access of the poor to rural water, both for home use&#13;
and for agricultural intensification, and help to reduce drudgery which rural people face through&#13;
the lack of appropriate means of transport between farms an villages. A central feature of the&#13;
project is the empowerment of rural beneficiaries, community-level institutions such as NGOs,&#13;
and DAs and their staff to participate in the design and implementation of development activities&#13;
in their area. All of these interventions would help improve rural incomes and living standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
G.   RATIONALE FOR IFAD'S INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.20  The proposed operation is consistent with the country medium-term IFAD strategy given&#13;
its focus on poverty alleviation through the development of basic, village-level infrastructure&#13;
leading to productivity and increase better farm incomes for the benefits of poor smallholders. A&#13;
central feature of the project is the empowerment of rural beneficiaries and community-level&#13;
institutions such as NGOs and District Assemblies through training and other forms of technical&#13;
assistance. The proposed project will also allow IFAD to join forces with IDA on a larger scale&#13;
for supporting the government strategy to decentralize planning and implementation of rural&#13;
development at local level. The operation has many elements that are already contained in&#13;
various projects funded by IFAD in Ghana (feeder roads, dams/dugouts, marketing and income-&#13;
generation activities). Therefore, the involvement of IFAD would help incorporate a poverty-&#13;
focused client-led approach based on experience gained over 15 years of rural development work&#13;
in Ghana.&#13;
H.   LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS OPERATIONS&#13;
2.21  Lessons from  the MTADS.  Since 1989, government strategy for agricultural&#13;
development has been driven by its Medium-Term Agricultural Development Strategy (MTADS)&#13;
which was developed with IDA assistance. The medium-term strategy focused on the following&#13;
key areas: (i) agricultural sector reforms to liberalize internal markets and create an enabling&#13;
environment for wider private sector participation in output marketing and input supply;&#13;
(ii) expansion in agricultural services (extension, research and animal health) to smallholder&#13;
producers; and (iii) provision of rural infrastructure such as small-scale irrigation, access roads&#13;
and rural markets. One of the key lessons from implementation of the MTADS has been that&#13;
significant shortage of implementation capacity exists at both the central and local levels and that&#13;
this shortage is a major constraint to achieving accelerated growth. While counterpart funding&#13;
has been a major problem for the sector in the past, there has been marked improvements in the&#13;
past two years. Government has taken measures, both in terms of its own Public Expenditure&#13;
Review (PER) process and in on-going dialogue with IDA, to ensure that counterpart fund&#13;
requirements are met in a timely manner. Also, with the decentralization process well advanced,&#13;
District Assemblies, although they still lack the financial resources needed to implement their set&#13;
development objectives, are more aware today of their pivotal role in local development. These&#13;
recent developments in terms of counterpart fund provision and greater awareness of&#13;
development responsibilities by local governments therefore provide a positive environment for&#13;
implementing the proposed operation.&#13;
2.22 Project-Specific Lessons. The three on-going IDA-financed operations supporting the&#13;
development of rural infrastructure are the Agriculture Sector Investment Project (ASIP), the&#13;
Community Water and Sanitation Project (CWSP), the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP).&#13;
and the National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (NFRRMP). The ASIP&#13;
focuses on marketing infrastructure, with sub-projects financed through matching grants to local&#13;
governments, communities and farmer groups. The key lessons from its implementation, which&#13;
are internalized in the design of this project, are that: (i) strong community participation in the&#13;
planning, implementation and management of rural infrastructure is essential for sustainability;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
and (ii) project design must take into account implementation support by private sector firms and&#13;
technical services agencies. The main lessons from implementing the CWSP are that: (i) rural&#13;
water development must not focus simply on physical structures, but also on the institutional&#13;
arrangements needed to sustain these investments; (ii) to ensure maximum impact, water&#13;
resources must be developed in an integrated manner to address twin needs of household&#13;
consumption and agriculture, including livestock; and (iii) community management and&#13;
participation are essential elements of ensuring the sustainability of rural water development.&#13;
Despite early teething problems, the experience of the TRP suggests that, if properly designed in&#13;
a manner that is consistent with the resource base and culture of beneficiaries, intermediate&#13;
means of transport (IMTs) can have significant impact on the economic life of rural dwellers.&#13;
While affordability is likely to remain a considerable constraint, one lesson of the TRP is that&#13;
this problem can be addressed by providing users with a more flexible menu of choices of IMT&#13;
technologies and affordable hire-purchase arrangements. NFRRMP has generated important&#13;
lessons in labor-based contracting and budgeting an prioritizing for feeder roads rehabilitation.&#13;
These lessons are also taken into account in the design of this project.&#13;
Lessons from IFAD Operations&#13;
2.23  IFAD's experience has shown that targeting the poor, while desirable, is often difficult in&#13;
practice. One way to limit "leakage" of project benefits to the non-poor is by geographical&#13;
targeting, whereby a project focuses on physical areas where the vast majority of the population&#13;
is poor. This approach is feasible in Ghana where there is substantial uniformity of poverty&#13;
within rural communities of a given ecological zone, and where poverty is perceived as a&#13;
phenomenon that affects the community as a whole. However, even the most uniformly poor&#13;
community will have some residents who are at a greater disadvantage. In the interests of the&#13;
poor, it is essential to adopt a non-confrontational approach that does not compromise local&#13;
solidarity systems. This can be done through the strong social pressures that are placed on&#13;
everyone, including those who are relatively better-off, to contribute actively to general&#13;
community well-being. Targeting within the community would be effected by applying&#13;
participatory rural appraisal techniques that bring to light the more vulnerable or disadvantaged&#13;
sub-categories of the inhabitants, facilitate a critical analysis of their specific constraints, provoke&#13;
discussions on how they would benefit from the project, and also how it would benefit the&#13;
community as a whole.&#13;
2.24  IFAD's experience has also shown that appropriate rural credit operations can have a&#13;
major impact on increasing the production and incomes of smallholders. The main lessons of&#13;
IFAD's experience are that: (i) careful organization and training of groups in credit use are&#13;
determining factors in credit success, and recovery rates vary with the type of activities financed;&#13;
(ii) groups organized and trained by NGOs have shown promising results mainly when group&#13;
membership remained small and manageable; and (iii) to sustain the rural financial system, a&#13;
strong emphasis should be put on savings mobilization. In addition, the experience has&#13;
demonstrated that given a sound macro environment, the involvement of credit institutions&#13;
(commercial banks, rural banks, credit unions) is essential in providing a souDd competitive&#13;
environment which directly benefits the smallholders. Finally, IFAD's experience has shown&#13;
that there are quality problems in implementing the rehabilitation of dams and dugouts through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 1-&#13;
labor-intensive methods. It is essential to use qualified private sector engineering firms for more&#13;
technically complex and large investments such as dugouts. Furthermore, dam rehabilitation&#13;
work should only be started if the benefiting community has set up user associations with a firm&#13;
commitment to operate and maintain the system once rehabilitation and community labor for less&#13;
technically complex activities has been completed.&#13;
2.25  The lessons from these projects have been taken into account under the proposed project&#13;
as follows: (i) the design of the rural infrastructure components would include provisions for&#13;
beneficiary participation in planning, implementation and management; (ii) NGOs and other&#13;
commnunity-based organizations would be contracted to assist beneficiaries in implementation&#13;
and to enhance their management skills to enable them to take direct responsibility for O&amp;M of&#13;
sub-projects; (iii) interventions would be targeted at the poorest communities and most&#13;
vulnerable groups to ensure real impact on intended groups; (iv) rural water resources would be&#13;
developed in an integrated manner, with community participation in watershed management; and&#13;
(v) a more flexible menu of IMT technologies would be introduced on a pilot basis to farmers&#13;
and introduction of IMTs in villages would be systemic -- linked closely to the development of&#13;
other village level infrastructure such as village tracks and trails and to private sector provision&#13;
of critical support services such as spare parts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. -- THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND CONSISTENCY WITH CAS&#13;
Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
3.1   The primary objective of the Village Infrastructure Project is to enhance the quality of&#13;
life of Ghana's rural poor through increased transfer of financial and technical resources to&#13;
develop and sustain basic village-level infrastructure. Specific project objectives are to: (i)&#13;
empower local communities and beneficiary groups to identify, plan, implement and maintain&#13;
small, village-level infrastructure investments; (ii) increase rural communities' access to&#13;
development resources to leverage the implementation of rural development priorities set by&#13;
government beneficiaries; (iii) strengthen institutional capacity at community and district levels&#13;
order to improve the efficiency of rural resources transfer and to ensure the sustainability of&#13;
poverty-reducing interventions; and (iv) support the government's strategy of decentralization of&#13;
development responsibilities to District Assemblies and other local government entities.&#13;
Consistency with CAS&#13;
3.2   The 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has as its central objective support for the&#13;
government's efforts to reduce poverty through rapid economic growth and human resource&#13;
development. This operation, with its focus on the development of rural infrastructure as a&#13;
means of improving the incomes and productivity of rural inhabitants the majority of whom are&#13;
poor, is fully consistent with the objectives of the CAS It would assist rural beneficiaries to&#13;
reduce post-harvest losses, improve the nutritional value of their produce, and increase value-&#13;
added through processing and storage. It would also increase access of the poor to rural water&#13;
and help to reduce drudgery which rural people face through the lack of appropriate means of&#13;
transport between farms and villages. A central feature of the project is the empowerment of&#13;
community-level institutions such as NGOs and DAs, through training and other technical&#13;
assistance, and the improvement of their capacity to plan and manage local initiatives.&#13;
B.   SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.3   The project would finance civil works, equipment and technical assistance for the&#13;
development of village-level infrastructure for rural water, rural transport, including intermediate&#13;
means of transport (IMTs), and post harvest treatment of crop and animal products, particularly&#13;
storage drying, and other simple processing techniques. In addition, the project would strengthen&#13;
the capacity of local government and beneficiary groups to maintain these investments. The&#13;
duration of the project is five years and its total estimated cost is US$60 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
C.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
Rural Water Infrastructure&#13;
3.4   This component would finance the integrated development of water resources for both&#13;
agriculture and household uses. This would include dugouts (with adjoining facilities for&#13;
drinking water), boreholes and wells, as well as small-scale irrigation development through&#13;
streamflow diversion and pumping and run-off management to increase yields of rainfed crops.&#13;
Detailed description of this component is given below.&#13;
3.5   Ponds, Dugouts, and Other Surface Impoundments. The topography of much of the&#13;
drier regions of Ghana does not easily lend itself to efficient surface water storage. Although&#13;
dugouts, ponds and other small water reservoirs may have relatively large water surface and&#13;
shallow depths with disproportionate volume of earth moved in relation to water stored, they&#13;
provide the only option for water supply in many areas of the North. Risks of contamination by&#13;
diseases would be minimized by appropriate fencing to restrict general access to the water&#13;
storage areas and their catchments by people and animals. In addition, safe water abstraction&#13;
points would be installed into which the water would be filtered for human uses. Drinking ponds&#13;
or special troughs would also be provided for livestock. Protection against erosion of exposed&#13;
slopes and against siltation would be given priority by appropriate planting of trees and vetiver&#13;
grass or other similarly deep-rooting and easily-managed vegetation. The project would finance&#13;
the construction and/or rehabilitation of about 92 dugouts and other small surface impoundments&#13;
over a five-year period, including the cost of engineering designs.&#13;
3.6   Boreholes, Hand-dug Wells and Spring Development. Much of the country's ground&#13;
water is deep and slow yielding. Shallow ground water that may be tapped by relatively&#13;
inexpensive means such as washbores and hand-dug wells is found in very limited areas. The&#13;
deep aquifer water is expensive to extract with capital cost of boreholes and handpumps&#13;
estimated at US$1,100 per cubic meter daily discharge capacity (ddc). Its use could only be&#13;
justified for human and livestock consumption (although for the latter, the physical effort of&#13;
raising the water with hand-operated pumps may be tiresome and unattractive to the persons&#13;
tending the animals). Washbores and hand-dug wells in shallow aquifers cost substantially less&#13;
per unit of daily discharge and could be cost effective in small-scale irrigation producing high&#13;
value crops. The project would support the development of about 425 washbores, tubewells and&#13;
spring development on a demand basis, including the civil works, equipment, engineering design&#13;
and the support for organizing and training communities for their operations and management.&#13;
The project would also support spring water development in farming areas where the opportunity&#13;
exists. This source of water is normally very reliable and relatively easy and inexpensive to&#13;
harness for community use. Provision is being made to develop small farmers' plots in lowland&#13;
areas using this technology.&#13;
3.7   Streamflow Diversions and Pumping. The project would finance the development of&#13;
small-scale irrigation from streamflow diversions, pumping and run-off management. Gravity-&#13;
fed systems usually involve lower costs and management skills and would generally be preferred&#13;
to systems requiring pumping. Opportunities exist for such water extraction and use along the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
considerable coastline of the Volta Lake and along many of the perennial streams and rivers in&#13;
the transition and forest zones. Provision is being made to develop about 2,400 ha using these&#13;
technologies to be managed by about 6,000 farm families.&#13;
3.8   Runoff Management. The yield of rainfed rice and other grain crops in the middle and&#13;
northern belts are highly dependent on timeliness and distribution of the limited and often erratic&#13;
rainfall. Failure of crops frequently occurs in these areas because of the unpredictability and&#13;
irregularity of the rains. Simple and proven practical techniques are available to increase&#13;
infiltration and retain in the soil a larger proportion of the rainfall for later use of crops and to&#13;
raise their yields. These water conserving measures are cost effective and are being promoted in&#13;
the northern areas where they are known to increase rice yields from about 800 kg/ha to over&#13;
2,500 kg/ha. The main investment costs are for the establishment of basic water retaining&#13;
infrastructure such as earthen terraces, banks, bonds and other flow controlling structures to&#13;
reduce the runoff and increase infiltration.&#13;
3.9   Pilot Integrated Catchment Management. Sustainable development of agriculture is&#13;
strongly linked with sound conservation and watershed management practices which protect the&#13;
soils, water, vegetation and wildlife. These types of activities should best be done by the owners&#13;
and others who depend on the land and its natural resources for a living. Technical guidance in&#13;
applying best practices may also be necessary under certain circumstances to achieve the desired&#13;
objectives. The rural water component of the project offers opportunities for communities to&#13;
improve agricultural production through a variety of activities such as those briefly described&#13;
above. Communities would be assisted to prepare integrated water management plans for&#13;
making productive use of available water, including related physical works and overall watershed&#13;
management. Since local or community ownership is essential for success in such activities,&#13;
beneficiary communities would be given the responsibility for undertaking integrated&#13;
management of the catchment resources as well as the economic activities they support.&#13;
3.10 The project would support a pilot program to develop these basic skills in communities&#13;
and set the stage for appropriate application of recommended catchment management practices&#13;
as widely as possible throughout the country. Focus would be placed initially on selected&#13;
catchments which reflect the major climatic zones in the country, including sahelian (Northern&#13;
Region), transitional (Brong Ahafo Region), forest (Central Region) and the coastal plains (Volta&#13;
Region). These pilots would be implemented under contract with local institutions which have&#13;
capacity for conduct of such studies, including the four universities and some of the research&#13;
institutes. Implementing agencies would be assisted by local NGOs for mobilizing the&#13;
communities within the pilot catchment areas, and organize the required training programs in the&#13;
recommended techniques. The pilot watershed management study would complement the&#13;
development of a broader, region-wide National Water Resources Management Strategy by&#13;
providing the opportunity to put community based watershed management into practice in these&#13;
agroecological zones.&#13;
3.11 Pilot Coastal Zone Management. The project would finance a pilot program to improve,&#13;
with community participants, water supply, sanitation and waste collection and disposal in&#13;
coastal settlements as well as along the shore line of the Volta Lake. These interventions are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
aimed at reducing the stresses on the fragile coastal ecosystems, which are currently threatened&#13;
by inadequate facilities and services as well as the lack of awareness among coastal communities&#13;
of the link between responsible methods of waste disposal and community health. The high&#13;
water table along the shoreline contributes to the problems of coastal degradation and health&#13;
hazards. Specific interventions would include (i) small-scale sanitation; (ii) water supply; (iii)&#13;
domestic waste collection and disposal; (iv) small-scale industrial waste collection and disposal;&#13;
(v) mangrove restoration and reforestation; and (vi) fuelwood lots. The pilot would also provide&#13;
technical assistance for the development of criteria for eligibility, application processes, review&#13;
and supervision processes, targeted environmental, sanitation and hygiene education to&#13;
communities, and evaluation and supervision of community activities.&#13;
Rural Transport Infrastructure&#13;
3.12  The project would finance selective improvements in existing feeder roads, construction&#13;
and upgrading of village arterial tracks and trails (VTTs), and promotion of various intermediate&#13;
means of transports (IMTs) to reduce drudgery among the rural poor. Under this component,&#13;
interventions would be planned to maximize synergy in the provision of rural transport&#13;
infrastructure, such as that achieved by linking the development of village trails and tracks to the&#13;
provision of IMTs with private sector support for services, and with NGOs' support for&#13;
implementation assistance at the training, planning, and supervision stages. Implementation&#13;
would be by labor-based method, following on the successes of the Department of Feeder Roads&#13;
(DFR) with this method in its feeder roads programs. The DFR would coordinate the&#13;
implementation of the feeder road rehabilitation program at the District level, and would train&#13;
small local contractors where such skills do not exist for program implementation using mainly&#13;
community labor, part of which would be the beneficiary groups' contribution to the&#13;
investments.&#13;
3.13  Feeder Roads Rehabilitation. The project would finance the rehabilitation of at least&#13;
1,300 km of feeder roads and spot improvements (including provision of culverts and appropriate&#13;
drainage) where the existing dilapidated conditions of these roads are major impediments to the&#13;
development of the rural economy. The DFR would work with the District Assemblies and, in&#13;
consultation with MOFA, agree on the priority target feeder roads to be rehabilitated and the&#13;
timing for linking them with the tracks and trails to be improved. These roads would then&#13;
become part of the DFR programs for routine maintenance and would be covered under the Road&#13;
Fund. DFR would be responsible for ensuring design standards and specification and would&#13;
supervise implementation of contracts for the rehabilitation and spot improvements of the feeder&#13;
roads.&#13;
3.14  In Ghana, feeder road maintenance work is being gradually transferred from the public&#13;
sector to private contractors. The DFR would provide guidance in selecting consultants for&#13;
planning the roadworks, and pre-qualifying and training local contractors to implement this sub-&#13;
component. It would also provide overall quality control and supervision of the performance of&#13;
consultants and contractors. With the recent establishment of a Maintenance Performance&#13;
Budgeting System (MPBS) and the Feeder Roads Maintenance Fund within the DFR, it is&#13;
expected that resources would be made available by the DFR for the long-term maintenance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
feeder roads rehabilitated under the VIP. Assurances have been obtained from government that&#13;
all such rehabilitated feeder roads would be included in the DFR annual maintenance programs,&#13;
with such periodic maintenance financed under the Road Fund. The annual maintenance&#13;
requirements would be drawn up jointly by the DFR and the participating District Assemblies,&#13;
prior to preparation of feeder roads annual maintenance budgets.&#13;
3.15  Village Tracks and Trails. The project would finance the development of an estimated&#13;
270 km of priority village-to-farm tracks and trails (VTTs) identified by beneficiary&#13;
communities. This component would also include institutional support particularly in training&#13;
communities for routine maintenance. NGOs would be used for this training as well as for the&#13;
planning of the works. The tracks would have standard cross-sectional dimensions with a&#13;
standard width of 2.5 meters and shallow side ditches. Drainage would have safe outlets to&#13;
reduce risks of erosion. An important consideration in the choice of target tracks and trails&#13;
would be the linkage between village and main roads. Works would be implemented by labor-&#13;
based contractors who would hire workers from beneficiary villages. To qualify for track&#13;
rehabilitation, communities would have to agree to provide some of the initial labor and to&#13;
assume full responsibility for maintenance of the improved tracks. This arrangement would be&#13;
put in place with the knowledge and support of traditional and other community leadership. The&#13;
sustainable development of communal VTTs is based on a long-standing tradition of community&#13;
self-help and the age-old practice whereby common users of tracks and trails that form the main&#13;
access routes to their farms meet periodically for routine bush clearing and maintenance of the&#13;
paths.&#13;
3.16 Improvements in Intermediate Means of Transport (IMTs). Improvement of tracks and&#13;
trails linking farms to villages would be conditional on the communities willingness to improve&#13;
the efficiency of transporting materials to the farms and their produce to the villages and onwards&#13;
to the markets outside the villages. This would involve the substitution of headloading by one or&#13;
the other of three forms of intermediate means of transport (IMTs) which have been gaining&#13;
acceptance in many parts of the country. These are mainly: (i) cycle trailers (CTs); (ii) donkey-&#13;
carts; and (iii) light trailers drawn by power units of small garden tillers. The use of CTs was&#13;
widely promoted under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) and is becoming widespread&#13;
in the urban fringes of the Northern Region. It has not yet penetrated into the actual farming&#13;
areas because of the lack of appropriate roadways or tracks to allow for their proper use.&#13;
Donkeys are used in many areas of the Upper West and Upper East Regions for ploughing and&#13;
transport, but the scope for their wider application is indicated by their widespread use in&#13;
neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso. The garden power tiller has been successfully&#13;
tested in some parts the forest zone during the last 10 years as a multi-purpose tool for light&#13;
farming operations, as a source of power for short-haul light transport, water pumping for&#13;
irrigation, and for threshing, shelling and milling of grain, grating of cassava, and soil tillage. Its&#13;
importance, particularly for light farm transport, is being widely accepted and farmers are willing&#13;
to save to purchase them. They are easily operated and maintained and spare parts and repair&#13;
capacity are locally available with private sector agents.&#13;
3.17  The project would finance the purchase of IMT equipment, technical assistance from&#13;
local NGOs to demonstrate the efficient application of IMTs, training workshops, and support to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
private firms in promoting their use. The greater number of cycle-trailer units that would be&#13;
procured under this project reflects their lower capital costs and greater affordability by the rural&#13;
poor and huge impact. It is envisaged that donkey carts, cycle trailers, and light transport trailers&#13;
powered by garden tillers would be made available to farmers' associations, upon certification by&#13;
a support NGO that they have been properly trained and are ready for this investment.&#13;
3.18   Technical Assistance, Technology Improvements and Training. The main measures for&#13;
ensuring that these investments are properly maintained would rest on the training of users to&#13;
operate in groups to take full responsibility for these access tracks, trails and transport facilities&#13;
and to undertake their routine maintenance. This training would be undertaken by NGOs and for&#13;
VTTS with technical guidance from the DFR. Experience with cycle trailers in some areas of&#13;
Ghana has shown the need to improve the design for a more robust unit to cope effectively with&#13;
the conditions between farms and villages. To address this need, the Project would enter into&#13;
contractual agreements with the Intermediate Technology Transfer Unit (ITTU) in various parts&#13;
of the country to test improved designs of IMTs.&#13;
Postharvest Infrastructure&#13;
3.19  This component would provide facilities for post-harvest treatment of crops and animal&#13;
products to enhance their value and shelflife (on-farm and village-level facilities for drying,&#13;
processing, storage, and other income-generating activities). It would also finance rural market&#13;
facilities. Given their limited resource base, farmers produce a wide range of crop and livestock&#13;
commodities in small quantities, but most of the products need some forms of post-harvest&#13;
treatment or processing to improve their nutritional and market values, convenience in use, and&#13;
storage capabilities.&#13;
3.20   Village-level Drying and Processing Facilities. Funding would be provided for the&#13;
construction and/or rehabilitation of small-to-medium size postharvest facilities such as drying&#13;
floors and platforms, cribs, crop processing and fish smoking units for small farmers and fish&#13;
handlers working in formal groups. These facilities (average cost of about US$1,500 per unit)&#13;
are applicable throughout the country but are particularly needed in the high rainfall zone of the&#13;
southwest and east where improper drying and storage often lead to high levels of waste and&#13;
lower crop values.&#13;
3.21   The range of crops which could benefit from intermediate processing includes food grains&#13;
(maize, rice, sorghum, millet), oils and seeds (sheanut, groundnut, oil palm, coconut), roots and&#13;
tubers (cassava and yams), and vegetables and fruits (tomatoes, plantains, bananas and&#13;
pineapples). The project would finance the procurement of eligible processing equipment and&#13;
facilities such as grinding mills, digesters, extractors and presses and other miscellaneous&#13;
equipment where the communities have organized themselves into management groups, saved&#13;
the required down payments, and acquired the skills to manage the investment on a commercial&#13;
basis.&#13;
3.22  Coastal and inland fishing villages would also benefit from this component. It would&#13;
provide support to fishermen along the Atlantic coastline and the shoreline of the Volta Lake, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
improve technologies for fish smoking and drying in order to be able to store the products and&#13;
take advantage of the market when prices are favorable to them. These activities are essentially&#13;
undertaken by women. Priority would be given to the simple and relatively inexpensive&#13;
"Chorkor" fish smoking technique which has been shown to be highly effective in producing a&#13;
better quality product in less time and with less firewood than the traditional method. Ownership&#13;
and management of these smoking and storage facilities would be by individuals or by groups,&#13;
with implementation assistance from NGOs in pre-requisite skills training.&#13;
3.23  On-Farm  and Village Storage.  The project would support the development of&#13;
appropriate individual as well as group-owned and managed storage facilities for small producers&#13;
of grain and other crops. In the maize belts of the Brong Ahafo, Ashanti and Eastern Regions,&#13;
these interventions are essential for protecting crops from damage by insects and other pests and&#13;
for maintaining quality while awaiting higher prices in urban markets. Technical support would&#13;
be provided by NGOs which are active in the development and management of appropriate&#13;
methods of storage and with expertise in crop inventory credit, for training beneficiaries, to&#13;
develop and manage these storage facilities.&#13;
3.24 Cottage Industries and other Targeted Income-Generating Activities. This component&#13;
is aimed at the more deprived families, particularly those headed by women. It would help them&#13;
to undertake to increase their incomes through small-scale business opportunities which could be&#13;
started with small amounts of "seed money" and with appropriate training by NGOs. Special&#13;
efforts would be made to target the more remote and isolated villages which are particularly&#13;
vulnerable to deprivation towards the end of the long dry season and during the rainy season&#13;
before the crops have matured.&#13;
3.25  Technical Assistance - Organizing and Training Users. The project would finance&#13;
technical assistance through local NGOs to assist beneficiaries to organize themselves into&#13;
manageable groups, who would then be given the essential management skills, including the&#13;
ability to get into a savings mode so as to ensure reliable debt service capacity for future credit&#13;
operations. Beneficiaries would be required to set aside on a regular basis a part of the income&#13;
from the operations of the investment and hold it in escrow in savings accounts in rural banks for&#13;
repairs, equipment replacement, or expansion of the operation. The operation of the savings&#13;
account would be one of the conditions for support from the project and monitoring its proper&#13;
maintenance would be one of the functions of the NGOs assigned to assist user groups. An&#13;
important function of properly maintained savings accounts is the building of the type of&#13;
confidence between bank and account holders required to establish credit worthiness, and to link&#13;
rural groups to the fornal financial sector, preparing them to be self-sufficient and independent&#13;
in making future investment decisions.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
3.26  Rationale.  The main objectives of institutional strengthening under the proposed&#13;
operation would be to: (i) develop the capacity of local communities and beneficiary groups,&#13;
through technical and financial assistance, to plan and maintain village-level infrastructure in a&#13;
sustainable manner; (ii) strengthen the capacity of district-level institutions to improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
efficiency of rural resource transfer; (iii) strengthen the capacity of the District Assemblies for&#13;
planning and financial management (District Development Plans and district budgets); and&#13;
(iv) strengthen the planning, coordination and management functions of supporting departments&#13;
of MOFA and Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) and agencies&#13;
such as Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) and DFR that provide policy and&#13;
technical assistance to the districts and communities.&#13;
3.27  Specific Interventions.  The project would finance technical assistance for the&#13;
strengthening of farmer groups and community associations and their training in specific skills&#13;
(management, small enterprise development, relevant technical skills, etc.). Technical assistance&#13;
for beneficiary groups would be implemented by local NGOs and other community-based&#13;
organizations. Other capacity building efforts would be targeted at the District Assemblies and&#13;
their staff (participatory planning, district tendering capacity, procurement, financial&#13;
management, etc.), sector institutions (regional MOFA and MLGRD offices, regional&#13;
development planning committees, etc.) and community leaders. The project would also finance&#13;
equipment for training, office equipment, vehicles and installation and training for basic&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) with District administrators. In addition, the project&#13;
would train the more experienced and technically capable NGOs to provide skills enhancement&#13;
to weaker, but indigenous community-based organizations, thereby leading, over time, to the&#13;
creation of a larger pool of qualified NGOs that would provide implementation assistance to&#13;
beneficiaries in this and future operations. Small contractors and other local entrepreneurs would&#13;
be trained in the basic skills for organizing labor intensive roads construction and maintenance.&#13;
Farmers being served by new or improved tracks and trails would be trained in routine&#13;
maintenance of their tracks and transport facilities.&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit (RICU)&#13;
3.28  Project implementation would primarily be at the district level under the supervision of&#13;
District Assembly operational staff.  At the national level, however, responsibility for&#13;
coordinating implementation support to Districts and communities would be vested in a Rural&#13;
Infrastructure Coordinating Unit (RICU) with head office in Accra and four Zonal Offices&#13;
located at Tamale, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Accra (para. 5.10). Management coordination costs&#13;
over the five year period would cover the cost of staff assigned to these offices and their essential&#13;
equipment and operating costs, the establishment of a management system (MIS) for project&#13;
planning and monitoring, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the program&#13;
on beneficiaries.&#13;
3.29 Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The first claim on the credit would be for&#13;
reimbursement of withdrawals from the PPF for financing of project preparation, including&#13;
essential pre-project activities and pilot programs in village infrastructure development.&#13;
3.30  Unallocated. The project would have a total of US$2.8 million in unallocated resources&#13;
to provide flexibility in respond'ing to changes in client needs and to be more responsive to&#13;
changes in priorities during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A.    PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.1    Total project cost, including duties and taxes, is estimated at US$60 million (Cedis 229.7&#13;
billion) over five years, of which US$15.5 million (Cedis 58.4 billion), or about 26 percent of&#13;
total cost, is in foreign exchange. Duties and taxes are estimated at US$5.8 million (Cedis 19.9&#13;
billion) or about 9.7 percent of total project cost. Price and physical contingencies are estimated&#13;
at US$5.8 million and US$4.6 million, equivalent respectively to 12 percent and 9 percent of&#13;
project base cost. Price contingencies on local costs are based on the projections of domestic&#13;
inflation of 14.2 percent in 1997, and remaining steady at 5 percent thereafter up to the year 2001&#13;
(COD, 1996).  Price contingencies on foreign exchange costs are based on estimates of&#13;
international inflation of 3.4percent in 1997, 2.9percent in 1998, and 3.0percent for the&#13;
remaining three years of the project. Project costs are summnarized in Table 4.1 and detailed&#13;
estimations of project costs are included in Annex I.&#13;

B.    PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.2    The project would be financed by international donors (IDA, IFAD, KfW) and by the&#13;
Government of Ghana, District Assemblies, and local communities and beneficiary groups. The&#13;
IDA credit of US$30.0 million would finance 50 percent of total project costs, including&#13;
contingencies.  IFAD  and KfW   would provide co-financing  of US$10.0 million  and&#13;
US$7 million, respectively (16.7 percent and 11.7 percent of total cost). The Government of&#13;
Ghana would finance US$7.1 million (11.8 percent), including duties and taxes of US$5.8&#13;
million, District Assemblies US$3 million (5 percent) and beneficiaries US$2.9 million (4.8&#13;
percent). Participating District Assemblies would provide counterpart funding from their District&#13;
Assembly Common Fund (DACF). Preparation of District Development Plans (in a participatory&#13;
manner to ensure that the priorities of communities are included) would be an eligibility criterion&#13;
for district participation in the proposed project (para. 7.6). Beneficiary communities would&#13;
contribute in kind and/or in cash. The financing plans are detailed in Table 4.2 below:&#13;

C.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.3   Procurement procedures for the proposed  project are detailed  in the  Project&#13;
Implementation Manual, previously reviewed by the Bank, and would follow procurement&#13;
arrangements consistent with Bank Procurement Guidelines. For clarity and transparency, two&#13;
types of procurement activities are recognized: those by the beneficiaries in implementation of&#13;
their rural development programs, and those by the Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit.&#13;
Given the large number of small subprojects spread over a wide geographical area, a fair amount&#13;
of procurement activities would be through local shopping procedures. The summary of&#13;
procurement activities under the project is in Table 4.3 below.&#13;

Figures in parentheses are amounts financed by the IDA credit. Totals include contingencies.&#13;
Procurement for Works (Subprojects)&#13;
4.4    Procurement for works by the District Assemblies would follow the procedures and&#13;
guidelines of the District Tender Board (DTB). These procedures are acceptable to IDA and are&#13;
detailed in the Implementation Manual. The RICU would monitor the process, ensuring that all&#13;
procurement are done in accordance with transparency and in line with the principles of economy&#13;
and efficiency. The project would, during the first year, assist in strengthening district-level&#13;
procurement teams in carrying out these tasks.&#13;
4.5    Applicable Thresholds. Applicable thresholds for civil works would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Contracts for up to US$50, 000 up to an aggregate amount of US$13.8 million.&#13;
The DAs would administer such contracts and the Zonal Project Office would&#13;
approve financing after review of the costs estimates and bills of quantity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
Contracts would be through price quotations from at least three contractors from a&#13;
pre-qualified list of contractors in the respective Zone.&#13;
(b)   Contracts of more than US$50,000 but less than $100,000 up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$20.7 million would be through District Tender Board procedures. These include&#13;
advertisement of tenders in local newspapers, detailed procedures on bid opening,&#13;
evaluation and award, and award to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder. The Zonal&#13;
Project Office would verify and issue a "no objection" before disbursement occurs. The&#13;
zonal office would replenish the DACF for the amount of the contract less the districts&#13;
contribution (counterpart) funding.  When the amount of the contract exceeds the&#13;
envelope of the DACF, the Zonal Project Office would pay the supplier directly upon&#13;
verification by the zonal engineer that the work or applicable portion thereof has been&#13;
completed as specified under the contract. The threshold for subprojects for each Zonal&#13;
Coordinating Unit is US$100,000.  Contracts above US$100,000 but less than&#13;
US$200,000 are within the threshold of the National RICU and the RICU engineer would&#13;
review and clear such contracts before award. The threshold for IDA prior review is&#13;
US$200,000 and selection and contracts would be reviewed and approved by the IDA&#13;
Project Officer at the Resident Mission before disbursement. The RICU has prepared&#13;
simplified bidding documents and these are available at all zonal offices.&#13;
(c)   Contracts of more than US$200, 000, if any, would follow national shopping&#13;
procedures, with selection and contracts approved by the IDA Project Officer at the&#13;
Resident Mission.  Given the nature of individual subprojects involving small&#13;
construction work scattered in a rural environment, it is not envisaged that there would be&#13;
any ICB for civil works for district and/or community-based subprojects.&#13;
4.6   Local Communities and Beneficiaries. When the work is carried out by the beneficiary&#13;
groups themselves, disbursement for the physical work completed would be made after&#13;
certification by the engineer from the responsible Zonal Project Office. Communities and groups&#13;
would be assisted by NGOs in selecting contractors from the prequalifed list. The District Rural&#13;
Infrastructure Fund (DRIF) manager would witness all contracts signed between the&#13;
communities and the contractor, with a copy sent to the zonal office. The zonal office would&#13;
replenish the DRIF or pay suppliers directly. All such procurement will follow procedures&#13;
detailed in the implementation manual.&#13;
Procurement for Goods and Equipment&#13;
4.7   Procurement of all goods and equipment, including rental of earthmoving equipment,&#13;
pumps, building materials, etc., would be based on the following procedures:&#13;
(a)   Goods and equipment costing less than US$10,000, up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$900,000. This would be through direct purchases from local suppliers. If only one&#13;
supplier is available, beneficiaries should also check the nearest urban center to compare&#13;
prices. The Zonal Project Office would keep a database of costs for purposes of&#13;
comparison and monitoring and provide advice to beneficiaries on such purchases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
(b)   Goods and equipment above US$10,000 but less than US$50,000 would be&#13;
through price quotations of at least three suppliers. Regular audits would be made ex-post&#13;
by auditing firms assigned to each Zone of the project by comparing costs with prevailing&#13;
market prices.&#13;
(c)   Goods and equipment exceeding US$50, 000 up to an aggregate of US$900, 000.&#13;
NCB procedures using standard bidding documents with IDA prior review for contracts&#13;
above US$75,000.&#13;
(d)   ICB procedures would be used for lots exceeding US$250,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$1.2 million.&#13;
Procurement of Consultancy Services&#13;
4.8   Given that the rural areas do not have a critical mass of private sector consultants, each&#13;
Zonal Project Office would assist District Assemblies and beneficiaries groups in putting&#13;
together a list of qualified consultants in each zone. Payments for contracts for technical&#13;
assistance to groups, communities, and Districts would be through the DRIF, replenished&#13;
periodically by the Zonal Office. Contracts exceeding the capacity of the DRIF would be paid&#13;
by the Zonal Project Office directly to the supplier. The Zonal Office would also prequalify all&#13;
NGOs active in the zone, with input of GAPVOD (the apex organization of NGOs in Ghana),&#13;
taking into consideration their areas of expertise, staffing, experiences and current areas of work.&#13;
This list would be available to all DAs and beneficiary groups participating in the project.&#13;
(a)   Contracts less than US$15,000. At least three consultants or NGOs would be&#13;
consulted from the prequalified list and the contract awarded to the lowest quotation. The&#13;
contract would be between Beneficiary group and the NGO/firm, and witnessed by the&#13;
DRIF, with a copy of the contract sent to the Zonal Project Office.&#13;
(b)   Contracts more than US$15,000 but less than $50,000 The Zonal Project Office&#13;
would request detailed proposals from interested firms and groups in the Zone and award&#13;
contracts based on the lowest quotation. The threshold for each zone is US$50,000.&#13;
Contracts exceeding US$50,000 would be sent to the national RICU for review.&#13;
(c)   Contracts exceeding US$50,000. Both technical and financial proposals would be&#13;
solicited from at least three firms from the pre-qualified list and the contract awarded to&#13;
the lowest evaluated responsive bidder. IDA would review the selection and contract&#13;
before award. For purposes of efficiency and economy, the threshold for IDA prior&#13;
review is US$ 100,000.&#13;
4.9   The RICU shall package procurement of vehicles, equipment, and goods where&#13;
appropriate, when several Districts and beneficiaries are involved. These are expected to be&#13;
larger lots that would serve the needs of a collection of Districts and other beneficiary groups.&#13;
Procurement of such vehicles and goods and equipment would normally be through international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, apart from units or equipment required out of normal&#13;
scheduling which will be procured from IAPSO or national shopping procedures. Such contracts&#13;
will not exceed US$50,000 for an aggregate amount of US$400,000.&#13;
4.10  Assurances were received during negotiations that the procurement arrangements&#13;
described above would be implemented (para. 7.9)&#13;
Procurement under the RICU&#13;
4.11  Procurement of goods and consultancy services for the RICU and its Zonal Offices are&#13;
detailed in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
4.12  Procurement of goods and equipment for use by the RICU and its zonal offices would be&#13;
based on the following procedures:&#13;
(a)   Goods, equipment, and supplies costing less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$5. 0 million would be purchased by the RICU or any of its zonal offices through&#13;
direct purchases based on price quotations from at least three suppliers.&#13;
(b)   Goods and equipment costing more than US$50, 000 up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$3.3 million would be procured through NCB procedures with IDA prior review of&#13;
contracts exceeding US$100,000.&#13;
D.   DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.13  The IDA credit of US$30 million would be disbursed over a period of six years beginning&#13;
in FY98. The disbursement profiles assumes that very limited civil works would be undertaken&#13;
during the first year as the initial year would be devoted to project start-up activities, including&#13;
setting up of the Zonal Project Offices, evaluating and pre-qualifying NGOs, and strengthening&#13;
the implementation capacities of the District Assemblies.  After the initial year, project&#13;
disbursement would be expected to increase gradually as familiarity with the procedures&#13;
increases and more districts and organizations meet initial eligibility requirements for&#13;
participating in the project (Annex III). While the current disbursement profile for Ghana is&#13;
eight years, the anticipated slightly faster schedule under the VIP reflects the following: (i)&#13;
greater autonomy and decentralized procurement responsibilities to zonal offices based on pre-&#13;
determined thresholds; (ii) the increased familiarity of borrower with procurement procedures&#13;
through on-going projects; (iii) emphasis on pre-project activities in order to lay foundation and&#13;
put mechanisms in place before effectiveness; and (iv) detailed planning of procurement&#13;
activities before effectiveness. Detailed disbursement schedule is in Table 4.4 below.&#13;
4.14 A Special Account for the project would be opened in a commercial bank in Accra at&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. An initial amount of US$1 million would be deposited&#13;
into this account for the first year of operations; this would be increased to US$2 million during&#13;
the second year when the zonal project offices in Kumasi, Tamale, Cape Coast, and Accra&#13;
become operational. In addition, a Project Account would be set up in Accra for receipt and&#13;
disbursement of borrower's counterpart funds. The establishment of the Proiect Account by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
Borrower with an initial deposit of US$100,000 equivalent would be a condition of effectiveness&#13;
of the IDA credit (para. 7.12).&#13;

Note:  Donors finance 100 percent of foreign exchange costs.&#13;
4.15   Disbursement for expenditures under contracts valued below US$75,000 for each zonal&#13;
project office would be on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). IDA would replenish&#13;
the Special Account upon review and verification of all SOEs. SOEs from the zonal offices&#13;
would be sent directly to the responsible project officer at the Resident Mission with copy sent to&#13;
the RICU in order to avoid delay.&#13;
Advances to Zonal Offices&#13;
4.16   Funds would be transferred from the Special Account in Accra to the four Zonal offices&#13;
on the basis of a 90-day advance. The zonal offices would, at the start of operations, submit to&#13;
the RICU a forecast of their needs for the first six months of operations. The RICU would&#13;
review these requests and for the first of such advances, submit a letter to the IDA Disbursement&#13;
Division requesting concurrence to the establishment and operation of such advances. The&#13;
amount of such advances will be reviewed every six months and the necessary adjustments made&#13;
in the level of advance based on actual usage of the funds. In assessing the requests of the zonal&#13;
authorities, the RICU would ascertain that each zonal authority concerned has an accounting and&#13;
financial unit in a place that will be responsible for: (i) the proper recording of expenditures&#13;
incurred; (ii) the collection of the necessary documentation justifying these expenditures; and&#13;
(iii) their submission to the central RICU in Accra on a timely basis. The zonal authority should&#13;
open a Bank account in a commercial Bank within the zone and notify the RICU of the name of&#13;
the officials permitted to make withdrawals from this account. The operations and accounts of&#13;
the Zonal project offices will be reviewed every six months by independent auditors to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
that replenishment requests submitted by these authorities reflect expenditures related to project&#13;
activities eligible for financing under the project.&#13;
4.17 Replenishment of the Zonal Accounts. The zonal project offices would every month,&#13;
but no later than the fifteenth day of the following month, submit to the RICU a replenishment&#13;
request in the forrn of a letter signed by the Financial Manager and Zonal Coordinator indicating&#13;
the amount claimed on the basis of supporting documentation. The zonal authority should&#13;
submit to the RICU, along with this letter, the original of all invoices for expenditures incurred,&#13;
attaching an up-to-date Bank statement showing withdrawals made from the Bank account for&#13;
the payment of these expenditures. The RICU shall agree not to advance any additional funds to&#13;
the Zonal authorities without IDA's concurrence and will ensure that the zonal authorities receive&#13;
only the equivalent of funds they can justify through the submission of appropriate&#13;
documentation and invoice. Replenishment requests and documentation so approved by the&#13;
RICU would be sent to IDA as part of the documentation supporting the replenishment of the&#13;
Special Account in Accra.&#13;
E.   AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.18  There shall be two types of audits:  (i) a semi-annual review of implementation&#13;
performance of the Zonal Project Offices and the financial management performance at the&#13;
District level (both the DACF and the DRIF accounts), to be carried out by independent firms&#13;
under contract to the RICU; and (ii) the regular annual audit of the Special Account, Project&#13;
Accounts and SOEs to be carried out by an independent auditing firm (to be distinct from the&#13;
semi-annual audit).&#13;
4.19 Semi-Annual Performance Review. Given the large number of District Assemblies and&#13;
potential number of small subprojects covering a wide geographical area, the project would&#13;
employ the special services of four local auditing firms acceptable to IDA to conduct, on a&#13;
regular basis, semi-annual reviews/process audits of project financial performance at the zonal&#13;
and district levels. Terms of reference of the audit firms are in Annex IV. The objectives of the&#13;
audits would be to: (i) provide an early warning system to zonal project management; (ii) assist&#13;
the District Assemblies in improving their internal financial management and controls by&#13;
providing advice and feedback on their performance; (iii) provide advice to District Assemblies&#13;
on issues of procurement and disbursement, ensuring that procedures laid down and/or internal&#13;
controls are being adhered to; and (iv) conducts audits of zonal accounts. All reports of the&#13;
independent auditors would be made available to IDA and government. The frequency of the&#13;
review would be increased or decreased depending on acceptability of performance.&#13;
4.20 Annual Audits. All project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The auditors would submit audited financial statements and a long form.&#13;
These reports would be submitted no more than six months after the end of the government's&#13;
fiscal year (December 31).&#13;
4.21  Reporting. In addition, each Zonal Project Office will prepare semi-annual progress&#13;
reports of project implementation in each zone that would cover physical achievements,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
procurement, disbursement, key monitoring indicators, and studies under implementation in each&#13;
zone. These reports would be aggregated into a national report by the RICU Coordinator based&#13;
in Accra.&#13;
4.22  Assurances were obtained during nepotiations that the auditing and reporting&#13;
arrangements described above would be implemented (para. 7. 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.1   Rural poverty alleviation and capacity building requires multi-faceted interventions, and&#13;
as such, project implementation would require close collaboration and coordination between&#13;
several ministries and agencies as well as local governments and community-based institutions.&#13;
During project preparation, broad consultations were undertaken with all sector ministries and&#13;
agencies and with the NGO community on project design, and these consultations provided the&#13;
framework for detailed project implementation arrangements. The arrangements are underpinned&#13;
by the following requirements: (i) the need for strong coordination on policy matters that affect&#13;
the efficient delivery of rural infrastructure services to the poor; (ii) the need for close technical&#13;
coordination at the level of various implementing agencies; (iii) the need for an autonomous&#13;
agency responsive to beneficiaries and with flexibility to work efficiently across many sector&#13;
ministries and institutions; (iv) the need to build capacity within the administrative staff of the&#13;
District Assemblies as the focal point of support for the government's decentralization strategy;&#13;
and (v) the need to ensure efficient and transparent management of numerous small infrastructure&#13;
contracts scattered over a wide geographical area.&#13;
A.   OVERALL PROJECT COORDINATION&#13;
5.2   Project Policy Coordinating Committee. Policy coordination would be at the ministerial&#13;
level, while technical coordination would be at the levels of the chief directors (for ministries)&#13;
and directors (for agencies) or equivalent levels for other collaborating institutions. At the policy&#13;
level, the project would be coordinated through an inter-ministerial Project Policy Coordinating&#13;
Committee (PPCC) comprising representatives of the following ministries: (i) Finance; (ii) Food&#13;
and Agriculture; (iii) Local Government and Rural Development; (iv) Works and Housing;&#13;
(v) Environment, Science and Technology; (vi) Trade and Industries; (vii) Employment and&#13;
Social Welfare; and (viii) Transport and Communication. The PPCC would provide overall&#13;
policy guidance on project implementation and would be chaired by the Minister of Food and&#13;
Agriculture (or his designate). It would meet at least twice a year. Terms of reference of the&#13;
PPCC are in Annex VI. Durin2, negotiations, assurances were received from government&#13;
regarding the establishment, composition and responsibilities of the PPCC (para. 7.4).&#13;
5.3   National Technical Steering Committee. At the technical level, the project would be&#13;
coordinated through a National Technical Steering Committee (NTSC) that would comprise&#13;
representatives of the three main sector stakeholders - the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, and the Ministry of Works and Housing&#13;
- as well as representatives of: (i) the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR); (ii) the Ghana&#13;
National Association of Farners and Fishermen (GNAFF); (iii) the National Board for Small&#13;
Scale Industries (NBSSI); (iv) the Department of Cooperatives (DOC); (v) the Ghana Irrigation&#13;
Development Authority (GIDA); and (vi) the Ghana Association of Private Volunteer&#13;
Organizations in Development (GAPVOD). Membership would also include the Ministry of&#13;
Health, and the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST). The NTSC would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
be chaired by the Chief Director, MOFA or his/her designate, and the RICU Coordinator will&#13;
serve as Secretary to the Technical Committee. It would meet semi-annually to review the work&#13;
program and progress reports of the project, and make recommendations to the management on&#13;
the steps needed to achieve program targets. Terms of reference of the NTSC are in Annex VI.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were received from government regarding the establishment,&#13;
composition and responsibilities of the NTSC (para. 7.4).&#13;
B.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
District-level Management&#13;
5.4   The Local Government Law 1988 (P.N.D.C.L 207) which established the District&#13;
Assemblies empowers each District to be responsible for all development activities within the&#13;
District. Each District has an Executive Committee, headed by a Chief Executive, with&#13;
specialized Departments for Planning and Budget, Finance, and Administration. In addition,&#13;
each DA has the following (i) statutory sub-committees responsible of rural development&#13;
planning; (ii) a 5-year District Development Plan; and (iii) a District Assembly Common Fund&#13;
(DACF) to which the Central Government cedes in an annual basis, a portion of the national&#13;
revenue for rural development purposes. This level of fiscal and administrative decentralization,&#13;
coupled with the preparation of district-level rural development plans, provides an important&#13;
foundation for empowering rural stakeholders to sustain rural development. However, planning&#13;
and financial management capacity are generally weak within the Districts and strengthening&#13;
these functions is essential to any strategy of sustaining rural development. A key project&#13;
objective would therefore be to strengthen the capacity of DAs to better organize and implement&#13;
rural infrastructure programs in a participatory, sustainable, and cost-effective manner. This is&#13;
essential if rural communities and Districts are to be truly empowered to take direct&#13;
responsibility for infrastructure development at the community-level. Given this emphasis, no&#13;
parallel structure would be established at the district level for purposes of project&#13;
implementation. Instead, project management would be mainstreamed within the existing&#13;
administrative structure of each participating District Assembly, with training and other technical&#13;
assistance provided to directly strengthen such functions as procurement, financial management,&#13;
internal controls, and reporting. The existing administrative structure of the DA relevant for&#13;
project implementation is summarized in Figure 5.1.&#13;
5.5   District-level Subprojects. Each participating District would provide counterpart funds&#13;
from its District Assembly Common Fund (DACF) for sub-projects that are included in the&#13;
District Development Plan. For such eligible sub-projects, the District Executive Committee,&#13;
chaired by the District Chief Executive or his representative, would meet periodically to decide&#13;
on the priority subprojects such as feeder roads, dugouts, or boreholes that are within the&#13;
District's Development Plan and to also allocate the level of counterpart funding required from&#13;
the DACF. Implementation would begin once agreement has been obtained from the responsible&#13;
zonal project office as to the eligibility of the sub-project, the costs, and the availability of&#13;
District counterpart funding.&#13;

The District may pre-finance the entire investment from  its DACF, using the applicable&#13;
procurement procedures. After completion of works or portions thereof in accordance with the&#13;
contract, the zonal office would replenish the DACF less the counterpart fmnding provided by the&#13;
cistrict. Where the sub-project cost is too large relative to the DACF, the zonal office may pay&#13;
suppliers and consultants directly (para. 4.5b).&#13;
5.6    Communit-Owned Subprojects. For sub-projects owned by community groups and&#13;
associations, each participating District would establish a District Rural Infrastructure Fund&#13;
(DRIF). Subproject applications from beneficiary groups and cormunities would be sent to the&#13;
DRIF Committee for vetting and approved sub-projects forwarded to the manager of the DRIF&#13;
for processing, i.e., ensuring that beneficiaries, with NGO assistance, provide their matching&#13;
grants, sign contracts with partnership organization, receive training and are properly organized&#13;
to manage the investment. The DRIF committee would be inter-departmental and would be&#13;
chaired by the District Chief Executive and would comprise the District Coordinating Director&#13;
and the District Head of Finance, Planning, Works, Agriculture, and one representative each of&#13;
an NGO and Fanner organization and two community leaders. The secretary to the committee&#13;
should be the Manager DRIF selected from the private sector, but responsible to the DA.&#13;
Decisions by the committee would be by consensus. Approved sub-projects are then forwarded&#13;
for financing through the DRIF. The Draft Operating Procedures and Policies of the DRIF and&#13;
termns of reference of the DRIF Manager are in Annex VIII. Evidence acceptable to IDA that at&#13;
least 5 Districts have satisfied the eligibility criteria for participating in the p2roject would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the Proiect (para 7. 13).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit&#13;
5.7   While each District would be in charge of implementing its rural development program,&#13;
there is a need to effectively coordinate rural infrastructure development activities across&#13;
potentially 110 District Assemblies, and as many communities and groups. This is necessary to&#13;
ensure that a common strategy exists, to avoid duplication of efforts, and more importantly, to&#13;
avoid stressing the weak capacities of the Districts. There is also the need to coordinate the&#13;
activities of the various donors. For the initial process, and until DAs are properly strengthened,&#13;
these activities are best carried out through an autonomous unit flexible enough to respond to the&#13;
diverse needs of the many stakeholders.&#13;
5.8   Coordination of implementation support to the Districts and communities oin a the day-to-&#13;
day basis would therefore be through an autonomous Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit&#13;
(RICU). The RICU would be composed of a national office in Accra and four zonal offices in&#13;
Tamale, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Accra. It would be headed by a National Coordinator, selected&#13;
through a competitive search process and whose experience, qualifications and terms of reference&#13;
would be acceptable to IDA. The National Coordinator would be supported by two core staff: a&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Engineer to coordinate technical aspects of subproject implementation and&#13;
an Institutions Development Specialist to coordinate institutional building efforts among the&#13;
Districts, communities, and NGOs. In addition to these staff, there will be other appropriate&#13;
technical and financial officers responsible for finance, accounting, MIS, and internal audits.&#13;
During Negotiation. a2reement was reached that all staff of the RICU would be appointed on&#13;
fixed-term contract through a competitive search process (para. 7.2).&#13;
5.9   A key responsibility of the RICU would be to coordinate technical and institutional&#13;
strengthening aspects of the project, linking directly with the zonal offices and providing the&#13;
technical liaison with the sectoral ministries and agencies. It would be responsible for the policy&#13;
and technical liaison with the PPCC and NTSC, ensuring that project actions and interventions&#13;
complement those of other similar projects and donor initiatives in the sector. In addition to the&#13;
administrative functions of the project, including timely reporting and auditing, the RICU would&#13;
establish and maintain a strong MIS to provide up-to-date information on the status of&#13;
implementation of sub-projects in the various zones. MOFA would second to the RICU at least&#13;
four staff of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PPMED) who would be&#13;
responsible for monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment activities of the project in each&#13;
zone. The project would provide the appropriate logistics and training, where required, to enable&#13;
the staff to carry out their responsibilities. During Negotiations. agreement was reached&#13;
regarding the integration of the Project Unit of the ASIP into the RICU to create a single unit for&#13;
implementing the government's rural infrastructure program (para. 7.3).&#13;
5.10  Zonal Project Offices. The RICU would establish four decentralized zonal structures as&#13;
follows: (i) Zone I, with head office in Tamale, for the Northern, Upper East and Upper West&#13;
Regions; (ii) Zone II, with head office in Kumasi, for the Ashanti and Brong Ahafo Regions; (iii)&#13;
Zone III, with head office in Cape Coast for the Central and Western Regions, and (iv) Zone IV,&#13;
with head office in Accra, for the Greater Accra, Eastern and Volta Regions. Each Zonal Project&#13;
Office would be headed by a Zonal Project Coordinator, with a full complement of technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
administrative staff. To facilitate quicker response and faster processing of beneficiary requests,&#13;
each zonal office would have autonomy within pre-determined thresholds as set out in the&#13;
Implementation Manual and would not have to defer to the national office of the RICU on&#13;
routine implementation matters (para. 7.1). Zonal offices would provide technical input to&#13;
Districts within each zone in implementing all sub-projects, including the implementation of&#13;
technical assistance to rural communities and beneficiary groups. Zonal offices would draw&#13;
upon the services of short-term consultants and contractors as needed to assist in various aspects&#13;
of project implementation assistance. They would also work with the various regional and&#13;
District level agencies of government as well as with NGOs in coordinating assistance for the&#13;
implementation of the District rural infrastructure program. Measures taken within the scope of&#13;
the project to ensure financial accountability of the zonal offices and the administrative offices of&#13;
participating districts are detailed in Annex IV and para. 4.19. Terms of reference of the Zonal&#13;
Project Offices are in Annex VII.&#13;
C.    COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND OWNERSHIP&#13;
5.11  Community  groups and associations will play  an  important role in project&#13;
implementation. Through their elected representatives within the District Assemblies, they&#13;
would meet to vet the District development plans and, therefore, the nature, priority and location&#13;
of the infrastructure subproject to be financed under the project. They would also be responsible&#13;
in part or in full, for the maintenance of community-level facilities. Each beneficiary community&#13;
would contribute in cash or in kind towards the capital costs of the investments, with different&#13;
levels of contribution set based on the different categories of subprojects.&#13;
5.12  Beneficiaries' contribution are detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. For each&#13;
sub-project, a committee of beneficiaries would be established to handle the operation and&#13;
maintenance of facilities, including the collection, management and safekeeping of funds, and&#13;
the purchase of goods and services required for the efficient functioning of the investment.&#13;
Communities would also designate caretakers who would receive training and appropriate tools&#13;
as part of the project technical assistance, and who would be responsible for all routine&#13;
preventative and simple corrective maintenance of the facilities.&#13;
5.13  An important aspect of the sustainability of income-generation investments under the&#13;
project would be to put associations and groups of these poor small farmers and villages into a&#13;
savings mode and link them with rural financial institutions. NGOs would provide guidance in&#13;
opening and operating group and individual savings accounts. The contributions of the&#13;
participating groups to the investments would be met partly from these savings as well as from&#13;
pooled funds. The savings accounts of groups would be maintained during implementation of&#13;
sub-projects to take care of necessary repairs and replacements of parts. The long-term benefits&#13;
of a savings strategy is that poor rural groups would develop the capacity to deal more effectively&#13;
with formal financial institutions in obtaining credit at market rates. During the early stages of&#13;
group formation, the cost of development and training would be borne by the project and would&#13;
form part of the institutional development benefits to these rural communities and groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
5.14  For private-good subprojects such as postharvest facilities whose benefits accrue to&#13;
individuals, beneficiaries would be expected to repay the principal of the investment over a&#13;
period of time and installment amounts defined in the applicable contract signed with the DRIF.&#13;
Such repayments would go into the DACF, and would only be used for development purposes&#13;
within the District. These development activities are expected to be those that facilitate private&#13;
sector activities within the districts.&#13;
D.   BENEFICIARY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#13;
5.15  The eligibility criteria for participation by districts, communities and farmer groups and&#13;
associations are detailed in the Implementation Manual. A summary is provided in Annex 1II.&#13;
These criteria were finalized during appraisal, and agreed upon during negotiations (paras. 7.6&#13;
and 7.7). However, these criteria are guidelines and would therefore be subject to periodic&#13;
reviews and adjustments made as necessary based on implementation experience.  Such&#13;
adjustments would be agreed upon between IDA and the Borrower during supervision mission.&#13;
In order to avoid start-up delays, steps have been taken by MOFA to ensure that as many&#13;
potential beneficiaries as possible meet these requirements in the period after appraisal and prior&#13;
to credit effectiveness. The eligibility criteria for District Assemblies would include: (i) adequate&#13;
staffing; (ii) agreement to use the District Assembly Common Fund account for purposes of&#13;
counterpart funding; and (iii) a District Development Plan, prepared in a participatory manner&#13;
with the communities. Before project effectiveness in each District, an assessment of the&#13;
institutions strengthening needs would be undertaken to ensure complimentarity with other donor&#13;
programs (para. 7.8).&#13;
5.16  Beneficiary groups and associations would be required to have formed an association,&#13;
whose membership is consistent with the needs and cultural outlook of the group (where such&#13;
organizations already exist, their current functions could be expanded to include developing and&#13;
managing infrastructure facilities to be supported under the project). They would also have to&#13;
agree as part of the technical assistance contract signed with the partnership NGO, to take full&#13;
responsibility for the proper operation of the facility, including adequate routine recurrent&#13;
maintenance to sustain it. For post-harvest equipment, such as those for small-scale processing,&#13;
drying, storage, etc., the project would require that beneficiaries have opened an account with the&#13;
local rural bank or other commercial bank from which they would; (i) provide a designated&#13;
amount of the capital costs of the investments; and (ii) part of the annual net income of the&#13;
investment would be lodged in a rural financial institution to be applied to operate and replace&#13;
assets and diversify into other infrastructure type ventures in the district. NGOs would be&#13;
contracted to provide technical assistance to the groups from the sub-project identification stage&#13;
through the implementation and management stages and would monitor and ensure that the&#13;
group goes through the essential learning steps to sustain the investments.&#13;
E.    PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.17 The RICU, the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Departments (PPMEDs) of&#13;
MOFA and MLGRD and IDA would monitor project implementation performance on a regular&#13;
basis through reports, audits, and supervision missions. The monitorable indicators for specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
project actions are in Annex X. Quantitative input and output matrix with major project factors&#13;
are in Annex XI. In addition, IDA would monitor the compliance of the RICU with procurement&#13;
and disbursement procedures, and credit agreements and legal covenants.&#13;
5.18 Implementation Monitoring. The RICU unit would provide regular and up-to-date&#13;
information and data on the progress of each subproject and the progress made on all relevant&#13;
sub-projects as of program implementation. The RICU would set up and maintain a modem&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) for monitoring implementation progress. The MIS&#13;
would monitor the timeliness of pre-investment actions (awareness campaigns, pilots,&#13;
workshops), the efficiency of processing beneficiary requests (response time, number of visits,&#13;
time taken to complete individual steps, number of beneficiaries covered, etc.), and the&#13;
performance of supporting NGOs.  The RICU would prepare regular reports on these&#13;
performance indicators for submission to NTSC and IDA. In addition, independent firms would&#13;
be contracted to provide, on a semi-annual basis, process audits of all sub-project activity at the&#13;
zonal and District-level. These process audits will include contracting procedures, internal&#13;
controls procedures within District financial units, transparency in approval of sub-project&#13;
requests, record keeping, physical location of sub-projects, and standards and specifications.&#13;
5.19 Impact Assessment. The RICU will also collect data on the impact assessment of the&#13;
project on beneficiaries (communities, Districts, and groups) and this will be supported by the&#13;
collection of baseline information on project environment and potential beneficiaries. Both the&#13;
PPMEDs of MOFA and MLGRD would be strengthened to meet the specific needs of impact&#13;
assessment, including training and logistics.&#13;
5.20 Financial Monitoring. Financial audits would be conducted (see paras. 4.19 to 4.20) to&#13;
monitor management of accounts and compliance with procurement procedures. These would be&#13;
conducted by independent auditing firms.&#13;
F. PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
5.21  IDA supervision will be closely linked to the project implementation schedule (Annex 1I).&#13;
IDA supervision will include: (a) continuous supervision and implementation assistance through&#13;
the resident project supervisor; (b) regular supervision and monitoring of key events through&#13;
supervision missions; and (c) yearly review of the work program, the project launching workshop&#13;
and the Mid-Term review. MOFA will participate in supervision through progress reports and&#13;
participation in supervision and review missions.&#13;
5.22 Regular Supervision and Review Missions. Regular supervision will include review of&#13;
progress reports, procurement, correspondence and implementation assistance to the Borrower.&#13;
Apart from the Task Team Leader (TTL), the regular supervision team will include: a rural&#13;
infrastructure specialist, a rural sociologist, a procurement analyst, a disbursement analyst, and a&#13;
financial analyst.  The infrastructure specialist will focus on the technical quality of the&#13;
investments, the management of the contracts, and recommend adoption of standard formulas in&#13;
contracts with small contractors. The Institutions Specialist will review participation issues with&#13;
local communities and design ways to improve project impact.  The procurement and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
disbursement specialist will assist the Borrower with implementation of IDA's procedures and&#13;
requirements. The financial analyst (or economist) will review the financial management&#13;
(including Special Accounts) and recommend ways to improve financial management.&#13;
5.23  The Project supervision missions will focus on the physical implementation, the&#13;
management performance, impact assessment and financial control. The key areas to supervise&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   Physical implementation: the physical project targets such as number and type of&#13;
projects; number and type of beneficiaries; involvement of local communities;&#13;
implementation rate; regional investment spread; etc.&#13;
(b)   Management performance: project response to local demands; subprojects lead&#13;
times; procurement, disbursement and accounting practices; subprojects cost&#13;
control; and&#13;
(c)   Financial control: maintenance of adequate  controls at all levels of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.24 Project Launching Workshop. The Project Launching Workshop will take place as soon&#13;
as the conditions for effectiveness are met. The workshop will focus on: (i) general and specific&#13;
procurement guidelines such as: local shopping, price quotation, direct contracting, guidelines for&#13;
recruitment of local consultant; (ii) disbursement methods for project funds such as direct&#13;
payments to suppliers, Statements of Expenditure and documentation to be kept and to be&#13;
forwarded to IDA; (iii) management of the Special Account and the control of the revolving&#13;
fund; (iv) audit requirements; (v) project supervision and reviews (vi) communications with IDA;&#13;
(vii) implementation of the project; and (viii) other subjects of particular interest to the Borrower&#13;
and zonal Offices.&#13;
5.25  First Year Implementation Review. At the end of the first year of implementation, a&#13;
joint review by IDA and the Borrower would be undertaken in order to examine the overall and&#13;
detailed performance of the project and, if necessary, make recommendations and take steps to&#13;
improve the project performance. It will cover the same subjects as the supervision mission, but&#13;
will enter into much more detail on the physical project implementation aspects (quality,&#13;
standards, efficiency of implementing subprojects, etc.).&#13;
5.26 Mid-Term Review. The Project mid-term review will evaluate in-depth the physical and&#13;
financial aspects of project implementation, and in particular, its developmental impact. To this&#13;
extent the government, and in particular PPMED, will prepare a Mid-Term report of the project&#13;
to facilitate this review. Terms of Reference for the MTR will be drawn up during the project&#13;
implementation at least three months before the time of the review and will be agreed upon with&#13;
IDA.&#13;
5.27  Implementation  Completion  Report.   An  Implementation  Completion  Report&#13;
summarizing the achievements of the project and its impact vis-a-vis its objectives will be&#13;
submitted by the government to IDA not later than six months after the completion of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
The ICR will be carried by the government and IDA and will cover a full ex-post evaluation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
5.28  Participation by Borrower. Borrower will participate in the supervision through half-&#13;
yearly progress reports by the RICU to be sent to IDA. The Borrower will assist all supervision&#13;
missions by providing information on the project and organizing wrap-up meetings. The&#13;
Borrower will participate in all reviews:   Proiect Launching Workshop, First Year&#13;
Implementation Review, Mid-Term Review and Implementation Completion Review.&#13;
5.29  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the above monitoring and evaluation&#13;
arrangements would be followed (para. 7.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A.    DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS AND COSTS&#13;
Measurement of Benefits&#13;
6.1   The approach taken here is to include in the economic analysis only those benefits that&#13;
can be quantified. Intangible benefits, such as health status of the community from accessing&#13;
safer water sources which are difficult to quantify, are excluded from the economic analysis. To&#13;
the extent possible, these nonquantifiable benefits are described in terms of their impact on the&#13;
welfare of rural communities and groups.&#13;
6.2    Quantifiable Benefits. Benefits of post-harvest facilities are measured from two sources:&#13;
(i) reduced losses; and (ii) lowered cost of processing, the latter measured in terms of the&#13;
opportunity cost of time saved as a result of substituting traditional technologies with more&#13;
efficient processing methods. In addition to reduced losses and time saved, processing of food&#13;
crops would also result in improvement in the quality of food available for consumption or sale&#13;
and quantity. A third category of benefits of post-harvest technologies is employment. The&#13;
adoption of post-harvest technologies would lead to increased demand for operators and&#13;
unskilled workers, as farmers expand farm size in light of higher prices, improved storability and&#13;
greater demand for processed products.&#13;
6.3   Benefits from rural water are measured both by the value of time saved and the "imputed&#13;
price" of water. For water used for small-scale irrigation, such as that from streamflow diversion&#13;
and pumping, benefits are measured in terms of the incremental yield of crops and the value of&#13;
additional dry season cultivation made possible with the availability of water. For water&#13;
consumed by rural families, an important benefit is the reduction in water-borne diseases as safer&#13;
water sources are made available close to the villages, but this is difficult to quantify. Given that&#13;
the primary use of most dugouts and streamflow diversions proposed for development under the&#13;
project would be for intensification of agriculture, estimation of benefits focused mainly on the&#13;
incremental value of agricultural production due to the adoption of these technologies.&#13;
6.4   Rural transport infrastructure, such as village trails and tracks, increase access of rural&#13;
inhabitants to a wide range of social and economic facilities and services. Access roads and&#13;
village tracks also facilitate easier transport of agricultural inputs to farms as well as the efficient&#13;
evacuation of crops from farms to villages and onwards, to urban markets. The timely&#13;
evacuation of crops reduce post-harvest losses and the availability of inputs and increased access&#13;
to markets enable smallholders to respond quicker to market signals, either by expanding farm&#13;
size or changing their crop mix. Development of trails and tracks, combined with appropriate&#13;
introduction of intermediate means of transport (IMTs), can also significantly reduce drudgery&#13;
associated with headloading produce from farms to villages, an activity largely performed by&#13;
women and children. The benefits of rural transport infrastructure development are many but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
only few are quantifiable. Determination of the economic viability of rural transport subprojects&#13;
therefore focused on two sources: benefits of increased agricultural output from the zone of&#13;
influence of the road, and reduction in transport costs. The zone of influence is estimated to be&#13;
within a of 5 km corridor on both sides of the rehabilitated feeder roads or 3 km for village trails&#13;
and tracks developed. These benefits from rural transport were estimated using the procedures of&#13;
Beenhakker and Lago, 1989.1&#13;
Determination of Costs&#13;
6.5    All costs were estimated using prices for goods, equipment, labor and other inputs&#13;
prevailing in Ghana in March 1996. The costs of post-harvest equipment were from the various&#13;
regional Intermediate Technology Training Units (ITTUs). Cost information for rural water&#13;
resource, including the costs of dugouts, streamflows and diversions were from the Irrigation&#13;
Development Authority, updated during appraisal. Cost data for feeder road rehabilitation and&#13;
for the construction of village trails and tracks were furnished by the Department of Feeder&#13;
Roads and validated during field visits to the North, Ashanti and Brong Ahafo Regions. The&#13;
rural wage rate was estimated at Cedis 1,200 per person-day for unskilled farm workers. All&#13;
agricultural outputs were priced at the farmgate, and prices of processed products were ex-&#13;
processing units. For internationally traded commodities, such as rice and maize that would be&#13;
produced from small-scale irrigation, import parity prices were estimated on the basis of the&#13;
prevailing world market price for each commodity, appropriately adjusted for transport costs&#13;
(international and domestic), local handling and other charges and converted to local currency&#13;
equivalents (Cedis) using the exchange rate US$1.00 = Cedis 1,600 that was prevailing during&#13;
appraisal (March 1996). Prices for internationally traded commodities were from the World&#13;
Bank Commodity Markets and Developing Countries (May 1996).&#13;
B.    FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY&#13;
Financial Models&#13;
6.6    Post-harvest Investment. Financial models were constructed for post-harvest processing&#13;
investments and income-generating activities. The financial models for post-harvest equipment&#13;
were based upon the following assumptions: (i) a useful life of equipment of 10 years for mills&#13;
and 15 years for engines; (ii) an estimated life of 20 years for physical structures; and&#13;
(iii) investments are through group ownership but with hired operator/manager providing custom&#13;
services. Cost of technical assistance provided by the project for organizing and training users&#13;
The functional form can be stated as: PMB (Q2 - Q  = (C2 - Cd - (K2Q2 - K,Qd, where, B = B, + B2; B, = P2Q2 -&#13;
P,Q, (C2 - Cd; B2 = F2Q2 - F,Q, (K2Q2 - K,Q,); and where, Pm = market price of crop measured in Cedis/ton; PIQ1.=&#13;
price and quantities of product without project situation, measured in Cedis; P2 Q2 = prices and quantities of crops&#13;
with project situation; Cl C2 = economic costs of producing the entire output with and without the project; F1 F2 =&#13;
fare paid to evacuate one ton of surplus over the access roads, with and without the project; if access road did not&#13;
exist, the cost of headloading can be used as a proxy; and K, K2 = economic costs of evacuating a ton of commodity,&#13;
with and without the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
was considered a grant and therefore not included in the analysis. No financial models were&#13;
estimated for roads, tracks and dugouts development given the public good nature of these&#13;
investments. The financial models showed a positive cashflow after the initial one-year&#13;
investment period for all options of processing technologies, indicating the relative profitability&#13;
of these investments for smaliholders.&#13;
6.7    Crop Models - Small-scale Irrigation.  Financial models were also constructed for&#13;
agriculture production using small-scale irrigation technologies. The investment in streamflows&#13;
and diversions would enable smallholders to grow higher value crops in valley bottoms or to&#13;
extend cultivation to the dry season. The main crops planted were assumed to be maize and&#13;
vegetables in the North and maize and irrigated rice in the South, with supplemental irrigation for&#13;
dry season production of rice. Around peri-urban areas, higher value vegetable crops would be&#13;
grown for sale to larger stores in nearby centers. The financial profitability of intensification of&#13;
farming, using small-scale irrigation are high and justify on profitability grounds, adoption of&#13;
these technologies by small farmers.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
6.8    Assumptions.  Financial prices were converted to economic values by removing&#13;
distortions in market prices of tradable and non-tradable commodities. Tradables were valued at&#13;
border prices, appropriately adjusted for domestic transport and handling. For non-tradable&#13;
commodities, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.85 was used to convert financial prices&#13;
into economic terms. The opportunity cost of labor was also estimated based on the standard&#13;
conversion factor.&#13;
6.9    The determination of the economic viability of the project was based on the following&#13;
assumptions: (i) a project life of 20 years with a one-year lag for the accrual of benefits; (ii) an&#13;
investment period of five years; (iii) all prices expressed in constant 1996 values; and (iv) an&#13;
opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR) for the individual project components are as follows: post-harvest, 32 percent;&#13;
rural water infrastructure, 23.1 percent; and rural transport infrastructure, 26.6 percent. Overall,&#13;
project economic rate of return (ERR) is 26 percent with a net present value (NPV) of&#13;
Cedis 218,683 million. The models for the economic analysis are in Annex IX.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
6.10   The procedure used to determine the sensitivity of project outcomes to various changes&#13;
was the switching value method. It measures the extent of change in the project NPV that would&#13;
make the project to "switch" from being acceptable to unacceptable. Based on pre-appraisal&#13;
mission findings, it was determined that project viability would be sensitive to the following&#13;
factors: (i) implementation delays, due to the time required to conduct community awareness&#13;
and implement other institutional strengthening measures before actual construction of&#13;
subprojects can begin; (ii) changes in project benefits due to fall in output prices or lower-than-&#13;
expected prices for processed output; and (iii) increases in costs of production mainly as a result&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
of increases in the rural wage rate. These factors therefore formed the basis of the sensitivity&#13;
analysis whose effect on project ERR are summarized in Table 6.1 below:&#13;

n.a: not applicable; (a) Not estimatedfor postharvest component given various intermediate processing stages.&#13;
6.11   These estimates showed that overall project NPV is not sensitive to changes in either&#13;
project benefits or costs within a 20 percent deviation from the base case. Similarly, individual&#13;
project components were also less sensitive to changes in benefits and costs of magnitudes not&#13;
exceeding 20 percent. Even for the most sensitive component, rural water, it would require at&#13;
least a 33 percent fall in benefits to render this investment component uneconomic. Because&#13;
there are numerous intangible benefits not captured in the economic analysis, the switching value&#13;
of 33 percent is within an acceptable limit for purposes of assessing the viability of aggregate&#13;
investments in rural water. However, during implementation, the viability of individual&#13;
subprojects, where applicable, would be ascertained before investment takes place.&#13;
Fiscal Impact&#13;
6.12   Government financing  responsibility  under the proposed  project is estimated  at&#13;
US$7.1 million, which includes duties and taxes totaling US$5.8 million. Since the duties and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
taxes represent transfer payments, the actual central government contribution would amount to&#13;
US$1.3 million over five years. Because the proposed operation is targeted at farmer groups,&#13;
communities and District Assemblies, and it provides little support for sectoral ministries, the&#13;
fiscal burden on the central government is therefore assumed to be negligible.&#13;
6.13  The second level of fiscal impact is at the level of the District Assemblies. The project&#13;
would leverage development resources ceded by the central government to local governments&#13;
entities for the purpose of undertaking projects which are included in the District Development&#13;
Plan. For participating District Assemblies, project funds would complement the existing&#13;
District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF). Under the project, the total counterpart fund&#13;
requirements for districts is currently estimated at US$3.0 million over five years, averaging&#13;
5 percent of total project costs. The counterpart fund requirement therefore compares favorably&#13;
with a total of Cedis 82 billion (US$42 million) ceded to the District Assemblies in 1996 as&#13;
Common Funds allocations. The counterpart fund requirements under the project would&#13;
therefore not impose any undue financial burden on District Assemblies for the following&#13;
reasons: (i) DAs receive ceded revenues from the central government for undertaking&#13;
development activities on a regular basis; (ii) and the project would finance sub-projects already&#13;
in the Districts' Development Plans, for which budgetary allocations would have been made by&#13;
DAs; and (iii) annual counterpart fund requirements would be minimal, compared to the average&#13;
level of ceded revenue of Cedis 350 million (US$184,000) per annum per District, equivalent to&#13;
US$158,000 per annum.&#13;
6.14 Matching Grants and Advances. Assistance to DAs would be in the form of grants that&#13;
would be used to leverage the implementation of subprojects in the District rural development&#13;
plan. However, districts would be expected to provide counterpart funding from their Common&#13;
Fund and to budget for O&amp;M and other operating expenses in their recurrent budgets. Project&#13;
resources transferred to beneficiary groups and farmer associations, would be subject to the&#13;
following: (i) groups must contribute in cash or in kind to the investments; and (ii) groups would&#13;
be required to open an account with a rural bank or branch of a commercial bank to which&#13;
regular contributions would be made, for the required initial contribution by the users&#13;
undertaking O&amp;M activities, replacing asset when it reaches the end of its useful life, or as a&#13;
collateral to secure additional loans from the bank for second generation investments; (iii)&#13;
beneficiaries would be expected to pay back the principal of the investments in equal&#13;
installments as set out in the contract; (iv) the reflows would be into the DACF, and these would&#13;
be used for development purposes as defined under the existing operating procedures and&#13;
policies of the DACF.&#13;
C.   PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
6.15  Key project benefits would be: (i) increased productivity and incomes; (ii) increased&#13;
rural employment; (iii) reduction in rural poverty; (iv) human resource development; and&#13;
(v) institutional development.&#13;
6.16 Increased Productivity and Incomes. The project would lead to higher incomes for at&#13;
least 500,000 households over the investment horizon. The introduction of labor-saving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
technologies would free up time previously devoted to transport, food-processing and water&#13;
collection. In parallel, improved access to safe potable water would result in a healthier and&#13;
more productive work force. As agricultural output grows, improvements in post-harvest&#13;
facilities would enable rural communities to reduce crop losses and undertake more higher value-&#13;
added activities. Incomes and employment would grow with the development of village-based&#13;
agro-industries. This effect would be further stimulated by enhanced income from livestock,&#13;
especially in the arid North, where access to water resources would help to stabilize herds.&#13;
Improvement of rural transport capacity would facilitate the movement of harvests from farm to&#13;
village; and of semi- processed products from villages to markets. Improved access to health,&#13;
educational and extension services as a result of better rural road linkages would also have a&#13;
beneficial longer-term impact on rural productivity and incomes.&#13;
6.17 Increased Rural Employment. The project would lead to increase employment of both&#13;
unskilled and skilled labor in the rural areas. This would come from the hiring of operators of&#13;
processing enterprises and of unskilled labor to provide services for bagging, packing and&#13;
storing. The rehabilitation of roads and the construction of village trails and tracks through&#13;
labor-based methods would also create employment opportunities in rural communities, and this&#13;
direct infusion of cash into erstwhile poor communities would promote food security and help to&#13;
reduce poverty.&#13;
6.18 Impact on Poverty Reduction. Given that isolation and drudgery are two central defining&#13;
characteristics of rural poverty, the project would play a significant poverty-alleviating role.&#13;
Improved access to potable water carries substantial benefits in terms of time and energy savings&#13;
and improved health. A reduction in the workload associated with food-processing and off-road&#13;
transport would also contribute significantly to time and energy savings for the poor. Improved&#13;
access to health and educational facilities would help the poor to break out of the cycle of&#13;
poverty in which they are currently trapped. Insofar as women are primarily responsible for&#13;
food-processing for household needs as well as for most transport tasks, including the collection&#13;
of water, they are expected to benefit significantly. Coastal communities will also benefit from&#13;
improved sanitation facilities, water supply and waste collection and disposal facilities.&#13;
6.19 Human Resource Development. The project would lead to capacity building in the rural&#13;
sector through basic training of rural communities and districts in technical and managerial&#13;
skills. The core civil service within District Assemblies, notably financial, planning and&#13;
budgeting officers, would be strengthened and this would lead to a greater pool of skilled and&#13;
experienced staff for planning and managing rural development at the District-level.. Other&#13;
benefits would be training of members of farmer associations and groups in basic financial&#13;
management skills are timely provision of O&amp;M.&#13;
6.20 Institutional Development. The project would lead to institutional strengthening of&#13;
District Assemblies, community groups and farmer associations. It would also develop capacity&#13;
among the local NGOs that would be involved in providing sub-project implementation&#13;
assistance to beneficiary groups. These efforts would promote sustainability of the poverty&#13;
reduction interventions being provided under the project. Stronger District Assemblies would be&#13;
better able to provide support to community development efforts, attract development resources,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
and better manage scarce resources. Stronger farmer associations and other rural groups would&#13;
lead to empowerment of rural beneficiaries to take direct responsibility and play a more active&#13;
role in local development efforts.&#13;
D.   PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.21  The likely project risks are: (i) slow development of capacity especially at the district&#13;
level; (ii) lack of coordination among various partners in the implementation of the program;&#13;
and, (iii) slow adoption new technologies by poor farmers, which may affect both the patterns&#13;
and uptake of new technologies. The likely impact of these risks on program viability are&#13;
summarized in Table 6.2&#13;
6.22 Slow Development of Capacity. While significant institutional capacity building is&#13;
programmed for under the project, capacity building is however a slow process. Slow&#13;
development of capacity especially at the District level would result in implementation delays for&#13;
key project components. However, from the sensitivity analyses, delays of one to two years&#13;
would have very little impact on achievement of project outcomes. Measures taken in project&#13;
design to mitigate these risks include close monitoring of NGO assistance, regular quality&#13;
supervision and management audits of all participatory District Assemblies, and regular training&#13;
of project beneficiaries and NGOs. A capacity assessment of Districts and NGOs would be&#13;
undertaken before effectiveness and interventions designed to address capacity deficit problems.&#13;
6.23  Weak Coordination Among Many Stakeholders. Project success would depend on&#13;
effective coordination and sequencing of activities among a large number of stakeholders -&#13;
community associations, District Assemblies, local NGOs, private sector actors, financial&#13;
institutions, and sector ministries. Weak coordination would diminish potential synergies arising&#13;
out of the project and would affect outcomes. The likely impact of this risk on the project would&#13;
be implementation delays. However, project ERR is not very sensitive to this risk. Measures&#13;
taken to reduce this risk are the establishment of the RICU as an autonomous agency, preparation&#13;
of detailed operating procedures and policies of the RICU and a full-scale information education&#13;
and communication (IEC) program to increase awareness of beneficiaries, including their roles&#13;
and responsibilities.&#13;
6.24 Slow Adoption of New Technologies. Some project activities would involve the&#13;
introduction of new processes and techniques with which beneficiaries may not be altogether&#13;
familiar. This is likely to be the case particularly with some types of IMTs. While conditions for&#13;
technology dissemination appear favorable, the introduction of new technologies is rarely&#13;
straightforward, and resistance among beneficiary communities may slow down project&#13;
implementation. The project has taken steps to ensure that technologies are simple and&#13;
appropriate; that they are cost-effective; and that they would be monitored regularly to ensure&#13;
that cultural problems are addressed.&#13;

E.    PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.25   The project is classified as Category B for purposes of environmental assessment. The&#13;
various interventions proposed are therefore expected to create localized environmental&#13;
problems. For example, establishment and/or rehabilitation of dugouts, village tracks and trails,&#13;
and threshing and drying floors could, if improperly done, raise localized gully erosion, water&#13;
contamination and groundwater depletion. The sinking of additional boreholes would increase&#13;
the abstraction rate from the aquifers in the immediate vicinity of the wells (less so on the overall&#13;
level of groundwater resources). Appropriate mitigation measures have been prepared for each&#13;
specific sub-project to minimize these environmental effects. The environmental aspects of all&#13;
project interventions were carefully reviewed by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency&#13;
and appropriate mitigation measures designed for implementation under the project, including&#13;
water quality testing of sources likely to be used for human and livestock consumption. The&#13;
design of the watering points for cattle, for example, would also include measures to minimize&#13;
contamination from surface sources. Test will also be made of aquifer yield potential before&#13;
decisions are made to establish new wells, to ensure that abstraction rates are compatible with&#13;
sustainable yields of the aquifer. The project would also have some possible environmental&#13;
impacts through implementation of the integrated catchment management and coastal zone&#13;
management components. Coastal communities would be assisted with water supply and&#13;
sanitation services as well as with technical assistance to restore and rehabilitate wetlands,&#13;
afforestate mangroves, promote fuelwood lots and other such environmentally-responsive&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
F.   IMPACT ON WOMEN&#13;
6.26  The project is part of a comprehensive effort to assist rural women and girls to better their&#13;
living conditions through direct transfers of technical and financial resources. Women would&#13;
benefit in several ways. First, given the dominance of agro-processing activities by women&#13;
groups, they would be the primary beneficiaries of this component. Reduction in post-harvest&#13;
losses, coupled with value-added through processing would directly increase incomes of rural&#13;
women. Second, women and girls are the major participants in the daily efforts to secure safe&#13;
drinking water for households. This activity often involves trips of up to 3 km to fetch water,&#13;
especially in the drier North of the country. Therefore, the development of water resources close&#13;
to village communities would result in time-savings and reduction in drudgery among rural&#13;
women. The time saved would give rural women greater flexibility to undertake other tasks such&#13;
as taking better care of children or engaging in productive economic activities, and girls, the&#13;
opportunity to go to school. Third, women and girls are the main headloaders of produce from&#13;
farms to the villages. The development of village tracks and trails and the introduction of IMTs&#13;
would remove some or all of the drudgery for them and reduce on-farm losses as products would&#13;
be evacuated more efficiently and quickly to village storage. Women in coastal fishing villages&#13;
would benefit through the provision of improved technologies for fish smoking and drying and in&#13;
the provision of storage and waste disposal facilities.&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH THE BORROWER,&#13;
CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A.   AGREEMENTS OBTAINED DURING NEGOTIATIONS&#13;
During Negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:&#13;

            Ghana - Village Infrastructure Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Village Infrastructure Project will
            support government efforts to reduce poverty and increase
            the quality of life of the rural poor. The project has the
            following components: (1) Rural Water Infrastructure -
            comprising integrated development and water resources
            management, including catchment management and other water
            conservation practices; investments for the rational use of
            water for agriculture, livestock and human consumption
            including small dams, dugouts, boreholes, hand-dug wells,
            streamflow diversion and pumping to support small-scale
            irrigation in the dry season; and rainfall conservation and
            management for more effective use in rainfed crop
            production. (2) Rural Transport Infrastructure - selectively
            rehabilitating and improving degraded feeder roads;
            developing village trails and tracks linking farms to
            villages to permit the use of simple wheeled vehicles to
            reduce the need for women and children to head carry
            weights; and a pilot program to develop intermediate means
            for the rural poor to convey goods to market. (3) Rural
            Post-Harvest Infrastructure - developing on-farm and
            village-level drying facilities to reduce post-harvest
            losses; on-farm and community storage and other
            village-level market infrastructure for more efficient
            marketing; appropriate facilities for processing crops,
            livestock and fisheries products to increase their quality
            shelflife and market value; and income-generating activities
            targeted at the poorest. (4) Institutional Strengthening -
            capacity building within district assemblies to strengthen
            their planning and financial management of rural
            infrastructure; strengthening NGOs and other community-based
            organizations to provide more effective implementation
            support to communities and groups in developing sustainable
            rural infrastructure; and empowering beneficiary
            associations and groups to take direct responsibility for
            the sustainable operations and maintenance of rural infrastructure.
