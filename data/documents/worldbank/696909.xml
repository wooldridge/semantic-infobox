NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          The proposed project constitutes a first five-year time slice of a long-term&#13;
National Natural Resources Management Program (NNRMP), expected to reach most of Niger's&#13;
rural communities. The goal of the long-term program is to slow down, stop and ultimately reverse&#13;
the current process of land and natural resource degradation in order to secure sustainable&#13;
agricultural production and growth, alleviate povertv and improve the living conditions of Niger's&#13;
rural communities. This would be accomplished by implementing a Community-Based Natural&#13;
Resources Management (CBNRM) approach (also known as Gestion de terroirs) for the rational&#13;
management and use of the renewable natural resources that constitute the base for agricultural&#13;
production. Under the CBNRM approach, assistance is provided to local communities to help&#13;
them design and implement sustainable management plans for their land and natural resources (the&#13;
"terroir"). The project wculd also help to create conditions for the success of this endeavor, in&#13;
terms of human resource: development, local community empowerment, data systems, and&#13;
financial, institutional, policy and legal framework.&#13;
1.2          The innovative, participatory and holistic CBNRM approach has been developed&#13;
and tested through several pilot projects launched over the last eight vears in the Sahel and is now&#13;
being adopted in most countries of the region. It addresses problems identified as a result of the&#13;
poor performance of earlier projects: some being too sectoral and top-down, others being multi-&#13;
disciplinary and multi-sectoral but with no links betveen sectoral components. The "Terroir"&#13;
management concept was endorsed during a regional conference in Ségou, Mali in May 1989,&#13;
organized by the Club du Sahel and the Interstate Committee to Combat Desertification in the&#13;
Sahel (CILSS), where representatives of rural comnuunities, donors, governments and NGOs&#13;
agreed that this approach needed to be tested on a larger scale in the region. Since then in Niger&#13;
and elsewhere in the Sahel, substantial investments have been made to promote that approach.&#13;
Il. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Economy and Population&#13;
2.1           With a per capita GDP of US$300 in 1993, Niger is one of the poorest countries&#13;
in the world. Its population, currentlv estimated at 8.5 million people, is growing at an annual rate&#13;
of 3.3 percent. This national average does not reflect regional disparities mainly caused by internal&#13;
migrations. Similarly, the national average for population density (4.4 in./km2) hides wide regional&#13;
variations, from less than 1 inh/km2 in the north and very arid north-eastern regions up to 80&#13;
inh/km2 in the higher rainfall southern fringe boidering Nigeria.&#13;
2.2           The rural population accounts for about 33.2 percent of the national total. The&#13;
vast majority of Nigeriens derive their livelihood from subsistence agriculture, under inhospitable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
environrnental conditions. Approximately 70 percent of the land area is desert or semi-desert. The&#13;
formal economic sector (accounting for about 28 percent of GDP), long dominated by an&#13;
inefficient public sector, depends on uranium. Uranium export receipts have accounted for 80&#13;
percent of export eamrings from 1975 to 1989 and an average of 70 percent thereafter. The&#13;
prospects, however, for this primary commodity appear bleak- due to increasingly unattractive&#13;
world market conditions. Since the downturn of uranium prices in 1981, the Nigerien economy&#13;
suffered from successive severe setbacks. At present, the economy is still in a deep slump. Real&#13;
GDP grew at a very low average annual rate of only 0.25 percent between 1985 and 1992. Per&#13;
capita income has declined by 3.4 percent per vear since 1980. Poverty and malnutrition levels&#13;
have remained constant, at best, and may actually have worsened in the 1980s. The informal&#13;
economic sector (about 135,000 micro and small enterprises, accounting for 72 percent of GDP)&#13;
consists of agriculture, small-scale artisanal and service activities, and influential traditional trade&#13;
with close links to Niger`s powerful neighbor, Nigeria.&#13;
2.3           In February 1992, Niger adopted a population strategy (document available in&#13;
files) which focuses on1 familv planning.  Recognizing the nexus of population growth and&#13;
economic development, the objectives of the strategy are to improve the health, nutrition and&#13;
education status of the population, and overall living conditions, with particular emphasis on the&#13;
most vulnerable groups, including women and young people; and to promote information and&#13;
research. In support to the Government strategy, the Bank is financing a Population Project (Cr.&#13;
2360-NIR) aimed at assisting the Governmcnt to implement an effective national population&#13;
program, with the primary objective of accelerating the onset of fertility decline by increasing the&#13;
contraceptive prevalence rate, reducing maternal mortality. promoting attitudes favoring a&#13;
reduction in family size norms, and enhancing the capacity of women to participate effectively in&#13;
socioeconomic development.&#13;
B. Natural Resources Endowment&#13;
2.4           Niger is not blessed by its natural resource endowment. The country is large&#13;
(1,267,000 km2), and has a small population. Mean annual rainfall ranges from less than 100 mm&#13;
in the North to 800 mni in the extreme Southwest. Rainfall is very erratic with long periods of&#13;
drought, often followed by flash floods.  Surface and groundwater resources are important&#13;
although insufficiently tapped. Soils are generally poor in terms of structure and nutrient content,&#13;
and are highly subject to erosion. Niger has four main vegetation types which are basically&#13;
determined by rainfall, ranging from the Saharan steppe of the North to the wooded savanna of the&#13;
South. Nationwide, araoble land is estimated at 15 million ha or less than 12 percent of the total&#13;
land area. Thirteen diffièrent land use systcms have been identified in Niger (see Annex 6).&#13;
2.5           Dry wooded savanna forests cover 0.6 million ha.  Fuelwood and charcoal&#13;
constitute the main energy source for 100 percent of rural households and 90 percent of urban&#13;
households. Fishery resources were important before the droughts of 1973 and 1983; they have&#13;
been drastically reduced, but may be able to recover if good rains continue. It is estimated that the&#13;
wildlife population has declined by 90 percent over the last 20 years due to subsistence and&#13;
commercial hunting and to the destruction of natural habitat through droughts and land clearing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
C. The A2ricultural Sector&#13;
2.6            Agriculture in Niger contributes about 40 percent of GDP, 85 percent of&#13;
employment, 16 percent of total export eamings and 100 percent of non-uranium export receipts.&#13;
With the projected continuïng decline of the uranium sector, agriculture is expected to become a&#13;
major source of foreign exchange in the future. The internal adjustrment measures taken by the new&#13;
Government, since the realignment of the CFA franc in January 1994, should contribute to&#13;
economic stabilization. With these measures, Niger stands a good chance for accelerated growth in&#13;
food crop production for cereal import substitution (sorghum, millet, rice) as well as through&#13;
export expansion (livestock, cowpeas, pepper, onion). This would lead to sustained improvements&#13;
Ln living standards and poverty alleviation. A major precondition for this agricultural supply&#13;
response to occur will be to ensure full pass-through of the benefits of the devaluation to rural&#13;
producers and to substantiallv improve the overall incentive framework for agricultural enterprise.&#13;
2.7           Agriculture's performance and contribution to national income have been erratie&#13;
over the last three decades. and largelv dependent on climatic conditions. Leading activities in the&#13;
sector are the production of cereals (millet, sorghum, rice and maize) for domestic consumption,&#13;
cotton, groundnut and cowpeas for export, and livestock for both domestic consumption and&#13;
export. With the recent devaluation of the CFA franc, livestock exports increased significantly.&#13;
Nigeria is the principal market for both export products. Total cereals production in the 1980s&#13;
increased only by 1.8 percent per vear. compared to population growth of 3.3 percent. As a result,&#13;
since 1971, Niger has had to rely increasingly on imports to mect domestic cereal demand, except&#13;
following the few years of good rainfall. Cotton and groundnut production was adversely affected&#13;
by the 1984-85 drought and. until the January 1994 devaluation, suffered from a lack of&#13;
competitiveness on world markets With the development of irrigation schemes, new off-scason&#13;
crops arc now taking off: cassava, cowpeas. potatocs, onions and other vegetables. This remains&#13;
however on a limited scale except for pepper.&#13;
2.8            Livestock production represents an important part of the agricultural sector,&#13;
involving about 24 percent of Niger's population and constituting its second largest export ($95&#13;
million) after uranium. Livestock suffered heavy losses during the 1984-85 drought and the cattle&#13;
population still has not fully recovered. During this time, manv animals were permanently&#13;
transferred further South, creating competition over natural resources between the crop and the&#13;
livestock production svstems. In manv cases, there has been a significant transfer of livestock&#13;
ownership from  pastoralists to farmers or to urban dwellers.  With the recent CFA  franc&#13;
devaluation, demand for Nigerien livestock from the coastal countries provides promising scope for&#13;
that part of the agiicultural sector.&#13;
2.9            Because Nigerien agriculture is drought-prone and subject to uncertain and&#13;
irregular rainfall, the use of inputs such as fertilizer and animal traction is costly and economically&#13;
risky, limiting the scope for increasing productivity in rainfed agriculture. What little increase in&#13;
cereals production occurred was largely due to bringing marginal land under cultivation and&#13;
shortening fallow periods. This reduction of the fallow is causing soil depletion and yield decline:&#13;
millet yields dropped from 600 kg/ha in 1960 to 350 kg/ha in the early nineties, thus forcing the&#13;
expansion of agriculture at the expenses of pasture, forcst or marginal lands. Forest land clearing&#13;
for agriculture, tree cutting for fuelwood supplv, and the effects of drought are causing an annual&#13;
loss of 100,000 hectares of forest cover. The spread of extensive cereal agriculture has accelerated&#13;
the process of land degradation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
D. Gender Issues, Land Tenure and Decentralization&#13;
2.10          Gender Issues. The degradation of natural resources is having a strong adverse&#13;
effect on the daily life of rural women. Most women have to walk long distances to gather&#13;
firewood or fetch water, while still carrying out their domestic duties and production activities.&#13;
Although, women, are important users of natural resources and very active in crop production and&#13;
small animal raising, their role in the design of development projects has generally been omitted,&#13;
underestimated or marginalized. Their role as users and managers of natural resources, and their&#13;
considerable knowledge on how best to manage these resources have not been fully taken into&#13;
consideration by decision makers and planners. Government services and projects staff are mostly&#13;
men who often do not know how, or do not see the need, to involve women more fully.&#13;
2.11          Land lenure. Rural lands in Niger have essentially been managed according to&#13;
traditional and customary land tenure rules, based on family ownership of the land and individual&#13;
land use -- rather than propertv -- rights. As long as land was plentiful, land tenure security was&#13;
not a serious issue. This situation has, however, changed over the last 30 years under the effect of&#13;
rapid population growth, rcpeated droughts, and subsequent migration. Arable land became scarce&#13;
and competition and conflict over land became increasingly frequent. In 1987, the Government of&#13;
Niger initiated the preparation and implementation of a Rural Code, which was approved March 2,&#13;
1993. The Rural Code constitutes a legal breakthrough in Niger and in the Sahelian region: it&#13;
establishes rules for the access, use and management of natural resources, principally land, water,&#13;
forests and wildlife. It deals with land tenure as well as land use and management, and requires&#13;
consultation with the people whenever public actions are taken for collective investments. The&#13;
Code also calls for the creation of Land Tenure Commissions at district level that will be&#13;
competent to determine land tenure rights and identify land uses. (See Annex 10 for more details.)&#13;
2.12          Decentralization and Local Community Empowerment. Individual ownership of&#13;
land and resources cannot solve all natural resource management problems, as many of these&#13;
resources are community-owned. Crop land can be -and de facto has always been- managed at&#13;
individual level. However, pastoral and forest lands, water resources and infrastructure continue to&#13;
be community or public property and their management and use in Niger is also often collective.&#13;
Local communities nonetheless do not have the legal identity and power to administer these&#13;
resources. A "Law Determining the Fundamental Principles of Administration of Districts and&#13;
Municipalities" (the Decentralization Law) was adopted in October 1993 by the National&#13;
Assembly and promulgated in September 1994. Under this law, districts and municipalities will&#13;
become legal entities. They will have responsibilitv over local finances and management of local&#13;
public services and community assets and will be represented by elected bodies, the District&#13;
Councils (CONSARs) and the Municipal Councils. Under the present law, similar autonomy is not&#13;
considered at the level of villages or terroirs, but this is expected to be the next decentralization&#13;
step.&#13;
E. Environmental Policy and Plannin2&#13;
2.13          Niger's principal objective in its new broad development strategy is to achieve&#13;
sustainable per capita income growth with equity. As part of this strategy, the Government&#13;
adopted in 1992 a Rural Development Policy Framework (RDPF) that considers four main thrusts:&#13;
(i) Natural Resources NManagement; (ii) Food Security; (iii) Intensification and Diversification of&#13;
Production; and (iv) Emnpowerment of Rural Communities and the redefinition of the role of the&#13;
State. Through the RDIF, the NRM strategy adopts an integrated, interdisciplinary and holistic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
approach, relying on an enabling legal framework and aining at a progressive transformation of&#13;
agricultural and livestock production systems while taking into consideration the fundamental&#13;
ecological equilibrium. In this context, land degradation is regarded by the Nigerien Government as&#13;
the country's single most important environmental issue and the most serious threat to the success&#13;
of its development strategy.&#13;
2.14          In 1985, Niger produced its first National Plan to Combat Desertification&#13;
(PNLCD), subsequently revised im 1991. The document contains a comprehensive analysis of the&#13;
state of the country's natural resources and emphasizes the need for integrated natural resource&#13;
management with a community-based approach as a solution to desertification problems. The&#13;
PNLCD created considerable environmentai awareness amnong technical staff and, to a certain&#13;
extent, ainong the public. In 1992, in its presentation to the UNCED Conference on Environment&#13;
and Development in Rio, the Government re-emphasized its commitnent to deal with&#13;
environmental issues in a comprehensive manner. It established in 1993 a National Committee&#13;
(COMNAT) to coordinate the preparation of a national strategy on environmnent.&#13;
2.15         In 1993-94 the Government cooperated with IDA in the preparation of a Country&#13;
Environment Strategy Paper (CESP). A copy of the CESP is available in the Project file. The&#13;
Government is now starting the preparation of its National Environmental Plan for Sustainable&#13;
Development (PNEDD) for which the CESP will constitute a starting point. Current plans are to&#13;
prepare the NEAP in conjunction with a national plan of action to implement the International&#13;
Convention on Desertification Control. These plans are expected to be completed by June 1997.&#13;
The National NRM Program (NNRMP/PNGRN) will most likely emerge as a key strategic element&#13;
in the PNEDD.&#13;
2.16         There are two main ministries involved with development activities related to&#13;
renewable natural resources in Niger: the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL) and the&#13;
Ministry of Water and the Environment (MWE). The MAL is responsible for agriculture,&#13;
livestock, natural resources, rural organizations, and agricultural research.  The MWE is&#13;
responsible for the design and implementation of policies in the area of water and forestry resource&#13;
development, fisheries, and pollution control. Coordination among technical services for the rural&#13;
sector at the national level takes place, in principle, through the Rural Development Sub-&#13;
Comnmittee (RDSC), responsible for the preparation of the RDPF (para. 2.13). At regional and&#13;
district levels, coordination is ensured in principle through the Departmental Technical Comnmittees&#13;
(COTEDEPs) at regional level, chaired by the Préfet, and the District Technical Committees&#13;
(COTEARs) at district level, chaired by the Sous-Préfet. In practice, this coordination has not&#13;
been very operational, and there is a need to improve it at all levels.&#13;
2.17         Decision makers and managers from donor groups and Government have been&#13;
working to devise more efficient institutional frameworks. In 1992, the Goverunnent merged the&#13;
Integrated Program for Natural Resources Management (PIGRN) under MAL and the National&#13;
Action Plan to Combat Desertification (PNLCD) under MWE to form the current National Natural&#13;
Resources Management Program (NNRMP or PNGRN). The staff of the former Cellule PIGRN&#13;
was assigned to the newly created "Cellule GRN" (C-GRN), also called the NRM Coordinating&#13;
Unit (NRMU), in charge of coordinating the NNRMP. The NRMU is an interministerial body&#13;
under the umbrella of the MAL and reporting to the RDSC. The NRMU staff consists of&#13;
professionals from three ministries: MAL, MWE, and MFP, and contractual staff. The mandate of&#13;
the NRMU is to: (i) elaborate and propose a policy and strategies regarding the management of&#13;
natural resources; (ii) provide support to government structures in designing and establishing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
development operations based on such policy; (iii) define a general framework to promote people's&#13;
participation in natural resource management; (iv) guide the activities of GON's partners, both&#13;
internal and external, towards sustainable land use; (v) assemble and disseminate data on past&#13;
experiences regarding production systems as related to natural resource management; and (vi) steer&#13;
programs and projects supporting natural resource management. The NRMU is also responsible&#13;
for setting up the NNRMP and preparing the proposed Project, considered as a time-slice of the&#13;
NNRMP.&#13;
2.18          The establishment of the NRMU was well received by a number of donors as a&#13;
means to resolve potential conflicts arising from the multitude of donor-driven initiatives. Some&#13;
donors, however, have expressed concem that NRMU may attempt to "control" all NRM projects&#13;
in the country, depriving them of their present autonomy. It is therefore important that NRMU&#13;
starts building confidence and consensus, demonstrates its skills and the quality of the services it&#13;
can offer, and clearly defines its role as a facilitator rather than a controller. The key donors&#13;
involved in NRM-related activities have been: Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands,&#13;
Switzerland, USA, as well as FAO, IFAD, UNDP/UNSO. A Working Paper with a list of NRM-&#13;
related activities and donors involved is available in the Project files (Document no. 13), and para.&#13;
2.24 summarizes the lessons leamed ftom this experience.&#13;
F. IDA's Strate2v in the Rural Sector&#13;
2.19          IDA's primary long-term goal is to assist the Govemnent to achieve sustainable&#13;
economic growth with equity. In the rural sector, IDA's strategy is to assist Niger in implementing&#13;
its own rural development strategy, which calls for a strong emphasis on poverty reduction,&#13;
environmentally sustainable rural development, promotion of food security, natural resource&#13;
management, intensification and diversification of production, empowerment of local communities,&#13;
and decentralization (para. 2.12). In line with this strategy, IDA is financing the Small Rural&#13;
Operations (Cr. 1890), Agricultural Research (Cr. 2122), Agricultural Services (Cr. 2355), and&#13;
Private Irrigation (Cr. 2707) projects. In addition, a Food Security Study has been completed. An&#13;
Agricultural Growth Strategy Study is underway, which will build upon past Governrent and&#13;
donor strategies and may lead to the preparation of an Agricultural Sector Investment Project for&#13;
Niger.&#13;
G . Lessons of Experience&#13;
2.20          The Maradi Rural Development Proiect (Cr. 1026/PCR 8920) and the Dosso&#13;
Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 967/PCR 7333) showed that increased inputs such as&#13;
chemical fertilizers do not necessarily result in increased outputs, even under favorable climatic&#13;
conditions, and that sound agricultural practices are essential for sustainable agricultural&#13;
development and growth.  These practices include soil and water conservation measures,&#13;
production and use of organic fertilizers, agroforestry practices, and crop diversification. All these&#13;
practices will be promoted under the proposed project.&#13;
2.21          The Second Forestry Proiect (Cr. 1226/PCR 10455) demonstrated that, under&#13;
prevailng conditions, ftee standing forestry projects, involving tree planting essentially for&#13;
fuelwood and small-scale timber production, are not economically viable and that integration with&#13;
agricultural and pastoral activities is necessary. Similarly, the major lessons drawn from the Niger&#13;
Livestock Project (Cr. 885/PCR 12791) are that strong links between pastoral, agricultural and&#13;
forest activities are essential under Sahelian conditions, and that further operations should deal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
with the agro-sylvo-pastoral systems as a whole. The domestic energy component of the Energv&#13;
Proiect (Cr. 1880), which has succeeded in promoting a better use of existing natural resources&#13;
(trees for fuel) and in increasing rural incomes, is now reaching the conclusion that the next step&#13;
would be to move, with the same communities, towards a more comprehensive approach that&#13;
would deal with the whole package of natural resources available to them. Under the proposed&#13;
project, integrated agro-sylvo-pastoral activities will be promoted.&#13;
2.22          The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1618/PCR 12980) led to substantial&#13;
incremental food crop production and rural income, but this could not be sustained after project&#13;
completion due to the top-down approach adopted by the Government's implementing agency and&#13;
the failure to properly empower farmer cooperatives. Reliance on farmer groups empowered to&#13;
make decisions over the management and use of their natural resources are fundamental principles&#13;
in the follow-on Pilot Private Irrigation Proiect (Cr. 2707). The Small Rural Operations Project&#13;
(Cr. 1890) has laid a foundation for multi-disciplinary team-work and beneficiary participation at&#13;
local level.  It does not deal, however, with the entire community and its natural resource&#13;
endowment but promotes independent income-generating operations for selected target groups. A&#13;
review of the above projects, particularly those at the completion stage, clearly indicates that the&#13;
lack of sound monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems prevented the inplementing agencies&#13;
from timely detecting shortcomings and from making the necessary corrections in the course of&#13;
implementation. Such problems make the assessment of projects impact difficuit and unreliable.&#13;
2.23          A survey of 111 pilot operations carrying out one or more NRM activities was&#13;
conductcd during project preparation. 36 of these were subjected to further analysis through field&#13;
visits and discussions with the communities. Despite their declared objectives, several of these&#13;
operations continue to operate on a sector by sector basis rather than in a holistie manner. They&#13;
focus on soil conservation, water harvesting and tree planting operations with little work on range&#13;
management and livestock production or on integration of agro-sylvo-pastoral activities. Some&#13;
operations, however, did succeed in adopting a more integrated approach.&#13;
2.24          The following lessons have been drawn from these earlier experiences and have&#13;
been taken into account in the new approach under the present project: (i) good knowledge of the&#13;
agro-ecological and social features of the targeted areas is essential to provide effective support to&#13;
communities in improving their NRM practices; (ii) to give communities a sense of ownership,&#13;
rural community participation must not be linmted to an in-kind labor contribution at&#13;
implementation but should involve the community in all phases of the CBNRM process, including&#13;
diagnosis, design, decision-making, planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation; (iii)&#13;
neither government services nor independent or autonomous project structures have been&#13;
completely successful in achieving and sustaining the full range of rural development objectives at&#13;
the field level, particularly in the absence of continued extemal assistance; field level actions need&#13;
to be complemented with appropriate policy reforms and institution strengthening activities; (iv)&#13;
human resource development must be included in any NRM operation; and (v) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, also often neglected, is a complex but essential tool for project adjustment during&#13;
inplementation and to draw lessons from ex-post analyses.&#13;
2.25          A separate study of farmers' participation, based on a sample of NRM projects,&#13;
indicated: (i) top-down approaches that still prevail in many projects, contrary to the participatory&#13;
spirit; (ii) a lack of communication and cooperation among projects, even those located in the same&#13;
zone; (iii) a limited effort to involve women except when their labor is required; (iv) limited&#13;
attention to land tenure issues; and (v) ambiguous relations with community traditional leaders who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
often control land tenure. The participatory process used to prepare the present project is explicitly&#13;
aimed at avoiding or confronting these issues. However, these issues should not overshadow the&#13;
positive achievements of these pilot projects, namely: (i) converging views amnong all agencies on&#13;
the promising avenues offered by the new CBNRM approach; (ii) a genuine interest expressed by&#13;
the rural communities in this approach; and (iii) emergence of a growing number of NGOs with&#13;
good field experience in rural community development.&#13;
111. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Obiectives and Rationale&#13;
3.1           Objectives. The proposed project constitutes the first five-year time slice of a&#13;
long-term National Natural Resources Management Program (NNRMP), expected to reach most of&#13;
Niger's rural communities (see Annex 7). The primary objective of the Program is to slow down,&#13;
stop and ultimately reverse the current process of land and natural resource degradation in order to&#13;
secure sustainable agricultural production and growth, alleviate poverty and improve the living&#13;
conditions of Niger's riral commnunities. The Project has tvo specific objectives: (i) to assist&#13;
selected rural communities in different agro-ecological zones in designing and implementing&#13;
management plans for lheir lands and provide them with the necessary know-how, information,&#13;
technical and financial resources and the proper institutional and legal framework to successfully&#13;
carry out such an endeavor; and (ii) to assist the Govermnent in building up a national capacity to&#13;
promote, assist and coordinate the diverse NRM initiatives underway in Niger in the framework of&#13;
the NNRMP, and help prepare NRM policies and strategies, based on lessons learned ftom field&#13;
expernence.&#13;
3.2           Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed Project supports both the&#13;
Government's developnient and IDA's country assistance strategies, as it is geared towards&#13;
alleviating poverty and promoting environmentally sustainable development in rural areas of Niger.&#13;
The Project's participatory approach corresponds to IDA's strategy to ensure ownership. Similar&#13;
approaches have been adopted by most other Sahelian countries, and are strongly supported by the&#13;
donor community. The proposed Project would: (i) build upon natural resource management&#13;
experience gained under recent projects funded by IDA and other donors; (ii) complement IDA's&#13;
key role in agricultural services supported by the ongoing Agricultural Services and Agricultural&#13;
Research Projects; (iii) demonstrate IDA's support and commitment to environmental protection;&#13;
and (iv) contribute to the continued improvement of donor coordination.&#13;
3.3           The proposed Project will lay the foundation for the NNRMP which will constitute&#13;
the central framework for dealing with environmental management issues that will be identified and&#13;
addressed in the PNEDI) (para. 2.15). The NNRMP will build upon the policy work initiated and&#13;
supported by the USAIE) Agricultural Sector Development Grant (ASDG II), particularly given the&#13;
new approach USAID is adopting as a result of its "re-engineering" exercise, whereby future&#13;
support will be geared more towards activities than to programs. The NNRMP is also expected to&#13;
become a useful instnrment for communication, exchange of information, coordination and&#13;
harmonization between all the NRM related activities and projects in the country. The NNRMP&#13;
should help to leverage a significant amount of ongoing and planned investinent in NRM for more&#13;
effective support of CBNRM activities, and to encourage more local level investment as a result of&#13;
the favorable conditions and support the NNRMP would generate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. Summarv Description&#13;
3.4           The principal Project components are:&#13;
(a)    direct technical and financial assistance to communities for the design and&#13;
implemientation of Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM)&#13;
Plans involving about 280 selected communities in five districts; and assistance&#13;
through ongoing NRM projects, to another 100 comnmunities in Niger;&#13;
(b)    provision of services to help achieve the Project's objectives, namely: human&#13;
resource development, national assessment of the state of natural resources,&#13;
natural resource information networking, research and studies; and&#13;
(c)    assistance to decision-makers in devising national NRM policies and strategies.&#13;
A detailed description of the major project components is provided in the following section C (2.05&#13;
through 2.24). The mcnitoring and evaluation and the overall management support components of&#13;
the project are described in paragraphs 4.01 through 4.20.&#13;
C. Detailed Proiect Description&#13;
Design and Implementation of CBNRM Plans (US$28.7 million)&#13;
3.5           Under this component, about 380 communities will receive project support to&#13;
prepare and cany out community-based or terroir management plans. About 280 communities&#13;
will be located in five of Niger's 31 districts, namely Boboye, Dogondoutchi, Goure, Say and&#13;
Tessaoua, and in eight of Niger's thirteen ecological zones, nanely Plateaux, River Valley, Dallols,&#13;
Goulbis, Eastern Plains, Pastoral, Dunes and Basins. The eight ecological zones have been selected&#13;
on the basis of their socio-economic importance, in terns of their contribution to total food&#13;
production for the country, and their relatively large population. Another 100 conununities&#13;
currently carrying out NRM activities under other projects will receive additional support, if and&#13;
when needed and at their request, with the intent of building up the concept of a national progran&#13;
(para. 3.12).&#13;
(a)    Direct Assistance to 280 Communities in five districts (US$25.7 million)&#13;
3.6           The selection of communities to be involved will take place during project&#13;
implementation. Although it is expected that ultimately, in the long-term program (para 4.01), all&#13;
communities in Niger will be reached, priority will initially be given to communities that typify the&#13;
different physical and socio-economic conditions prevailing in the five districts, so these can be&#13;
used as "models" for replicability. For the district of Boboye, where there are two projects&#13;
formerly funded by CIDA (Dallol Bosso North and South) and, for the interim period, by USAID,&#13;
the proposed Project will promote the continuation of the programs already initiated with promising&#13;
results in 38 communities and will select 47 additional communities.&#13;
3.7           The CBNRM  Approach described in Annex 7 implies that details about&#13;
investment operations to be carried out at the level of each community are not decided in advance&#13;
at the design stage of the Project but will be identified by the communities in designing their own&#13;
CBNRM Plans. Investments to be considered under the CBNRM Plans are of three types: (i) NRM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
investments providing long-term economic and environmental benefits, (ii) NRM-related economic&#13;
investments providing quick financial retums, and (iii) NRM-related social infrastructure&#13;
investments. The criteria for eligibility to the project's support of investments and beneficiaries will&#13;
be clearly defined in a specifically designed Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
3.8           NRM Investments will constitute the core of the investment program. They are&#13;
aimed at producing tangible positive results in maintaining or improving natural resource&#13;
productivity.  Examples of such investments are: soil erosion control, water-harvesting, soil&#13;
fertility improvement, pasture imnprovement, natural forest management, sand dune fixation, tree&#13;
planting, bush fire preverition and windbreaks.&#13;
3.9           NRM-Related Economic Infrastructure Investments identified and selected under&#13;
this category are expected to produce a positive economic and financial returm within a short time&#13;
period and support or complement NRM-related investments. Such investments could be: wells,&#13;
boreholes and irrigation schemes, construction of storage facilities for grain and production inputs,&#13;
cereal banks, rural markets, animal health services, and processing units for food and animal feed.&#13;
3.10          NRM-Related Social Infrastructure Investments are generally the primary concern&#13;
of the population. Furthermore, thev have an important impact on natural resource management&#13;
and sustainable agricultural production. People's health and nutrition affect labor productivity;&#13;
poor water and sanitatiori affects health; literacy and education improve people's ability to prevent&#13;
diseases, practice birth control and acquire new knowledge and technologies that will help them&#13;
improve their productivity and take better care of their environment and natural resources; access&#13;
roads bring services and goods to isolated villages and allow for the export of their production&#13;
towards potential markets in urban centers.&#13;
3.11          The design of CBNRM plans will be camred out during Project implementation&#13;
and will vary from comnniunity to community. The cost for implementing each plan will also vary.&#13;
Based on several scenarios considered during preparation and on the experience gained from other&#13;
projects in Niger and in the region, aggregate investment costs have therefore been estimated on the&#13;
basis of average costs.  A  reasonable estimate of average costs per community for the&#13;
implementation of a Terroir Management Plan, over a five-year period, is about CFA franc 35&#13;
million, equivalent to US$60,000. This amount is based on an average annual financial assistance&#13;
of CFA franc 10,000 per person and per year, for five years, and an average population of about&#13;
700 people per community. Current average per capita annual income is estimated at CFA franc&#13;
50,000. These investment costs do not include the in-kind contribution of the community for labor&#13;
and material, estimated at 50 percent of the value of financial assistance or CFA franc 17.5 million&#13;
(US$30,000) per community for a five-year penrod.&#13;
(b)    Assistance to 100 Communities through Ongoing NRM Projects (US$3.0 million)&#13;
3.12          There are more than 10,000 rural communities or terroirs in Niger and under the&#13;
direct assistance component of this Project, only 280 terroirs will be assisted. There are also&#13;
several other projects in the country promoting NRM and assisting other communities. However,&#13;
some funding and implementing agencies have limited resources to fully implement the CBNRM&#13;
approach and have expressed a need for additional support. Such support will be provided, upon&#13;
request, in order to rapidly increase the number of communities that can benefit from the NRM&#13;
progran and accelerate the implementation of CBNRM plans. Support would be in the form of&#13;
assistance for the supply of services (information, data, maps, training, surveys and studies) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
eventually for investments that would be identified in the CBNRM plan but for which no financial&#13;
resources are available. Through this component, it is expected that the Project can provide&#13;
assistance to about 100 more communities. Assistance will be provided after prior agreement from&#13;
the comnmunity, the local authorities, and the current funding agency. Selection will be based on&#13;
the willingness of the partners to adopt the CBNRM approach and on their previous performance.&#13;
This component will contribute in sharing experiences between different agencies, building up&#13;
cooperation among projects, and establishing a more coherent national NRM program.&#13;
NRM Support Operations (US$8.0 million)&#13;
(a)    Human Resources Development and Public Awareness (US$2.0 million)&#13;
3.13          Because the CBNRM Approach is innovative, it will require skills for which no&#13;
formal training is available in Niger. A strong training program will therefore constitute one of the&#13;
most important conditions for the project's success. All people involved in the core program and&#13;
needing to improve their skills will benefit from training: local communities, NNRMP staff,&#13;
technical staff from government agencies, district officials, NGOs and the general public will need&#13;
to be well prepared to provide support to the program.&#13;
(a) Local communities participating in the project will acquire knowledge on the dynamics&#13;
of natural resources and skills on terroir diagnosis, management plan design,&#13;
negotiation, use of new technologies, equipment maintenance, financial management.&#13;
planning, aund monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
(b) Project staff will be trained in the conceptual basis, methodology and technical content&#13;
of the CBNRM Approach. Training modules will include (1) group dynanics&#13;
techniques and communications skills, (ii) data collection and processing methods, (iii)&#13;
technological packages and (iv) planning, monitoring and evaluation methods.&#13;
Training wi.ll take place in three complementary ways: (i) basic training at the time of&#13;
staff recruitment, (ii) field training on most advanced terroirs, and (iii) continuous in-&#13;
service training based on annual evaluations and feed back. Project accountants at&#13;
central and district level will receive specific training in accounting and procurement.&#13;
(c) Local authority members will be trained on main principles and criteria for reviewing&#13;
and approving management plans.&#13;
(d) Local techrnical partners and extension agents will benefit from a short version of the&#13;
training provided to the project staff with specific emphasis on their work areas.&#13;
(e) Decision-makers and other senior staff at central level will be sensitized to issues such&#13;
as: need for decentralization and local empowerment, land tenure rights as an incentive&#13;
to successfiùl natural resource management, need for very strong coordination between&#13;
ministries and other government agencies, and transparency.&#13;
(f) Information and awareness carnpaigns will be organized for the public on natural&#13;
resource management and environmental protection.&#13;
3.14          Training of local authorities, local technical partners and extension agents will be&#13;
organized at the district level. The training methods --workshops, local field trips, wider study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
tours-- and the message content will be determined, based on focus group interview techniques&#13;
successfully utilized in other projects. Details on the Human Resources Development component&#13;
are provided in Annex 9 and in the Implementation Manual, as well as in the Working Paper on&#13;
HRD available in the Project files (Document no. 4). Close coordination with on-going training&#13;
and extension programs, and more particularly with the IDA-supported national Agricultural&#13;
Services Project, will be required to ensure consistency, particularly in the technical and&#13;
technological packages proposed to rural community members.&#13;
(b)    National Natural Resources Assessment and Information Network&#13;
(US$2.3 million)&#13;
3.15          Nationail Natural Resource Assessment. To respond to the lack of reliable,&#13;
comprehensive and compatible data on key environmental and natural resource factors, a National&#13;
Natural Resource Assessment wilI be carried out to accuratelv assess, countrywide, the current&#13;
potential of natural resources and the real extent of their degradation, examine the causes,&#13;
dynanics and trends and measure the effects on agricultural production. sustainability and growth,&#13;
on settlement and migration, and on the overall rural economy. This assessment will enable&#13;
decision makers (Government and donors) to take appropriate measures, better defme future&#13;
strategies and plan ancl target future interventions.  More specifically, the assessment will&#13;
determine the reduction and evolution of the vegetation cover and the effects of the different types&#13;
of erosion and bush fires, the rate of expansion of cropped land and the consequent reduction of&#13;
sylvo-pastoral areas, as well as the shortening of the fallow periods for each district. Evolution&#13;
and trends will be compared to data on water resources, rainfall, production systems and&#13;
population. This National Natural Resource Assessment will provide a baseline for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of all NRM projects.&#13;
3.16          A land use map will be produced using satellite imagerv and will be compared to&#13;
data obtained from 1975 aerial photographs, to determine the changes that occurred over the last&#13;
20 years. The old 1/200,000 scale base maps will also be updated using digitized satellite imagery.&#13;
These base maps will constitute the common geographic reference base which will be utilized to&#13;
integrate all other geographic information. This activity will be carried out under the leadership of&#13;
the Technical Support IJnit (Unité technique d'appui - UTA) of the Ministrv of Water and&#13;
Environment (MWE). An agreement, satisfactorv to IDA, to produce land use maps, compare&#13;
them with 1975 data, and deterrnine the changes that have occurred and their causes, has been&#13;
signed between NRMU and UTA. A condition of effectiveness will be that UTA has been staffed&#13;
in a manner satisfactorv to IDA, and has prepared a work program satisfactory to IDA (para.&#13;
6.3a).&#13;
3.17          Natural Resource Information Network. Information and data necessary to carry&#13;
out NRM Planning as well as Monitoring and Evaluation need to be reliable, compatible and&#13;
readilv available. Provision will be made for the establishment of a Natural Resource Information&#13;
Network (NRIN) including the identification and collection of missing data, and the verification&#13;
and correction of unreliable data. Selected information will be synthesized and grouped in special&#13;
data packages for specific needs. A nctwork of information suppliers and users will be set up and&#13;
meetings and workshops will bc organized. The NRIN mav later become part of a broader&#13;
national Environmental [nformation System (EIS).&#13;

3.18          The selection of terroirs, the design and implementation of Terroir Management&#13;
Plans, as well as the Project monitoring and evaluation will require (i) aerial photographs and&#13;
photomosaics at 1/40,C000-50,000 scale for the five selected districts to locate terroirs to be&#13;
selected and (ii) detailed maps of the selected terroirs at 1/10,000 scale for the diagnosis and&#13;
design stage, and for further monitoring and evaluation. As part of the institution building effort,&#13;
support will be provided to the Niger National Geographic Institute (IGNN) to manage this&#13;
operation. Photographs. will be taken in Year-One of the Project by an intemational firm under&#13;
IGNN supervision. Prints, photomosaics and maps will be produced by IGNN. An agreement&#13;
between NRMU and IGNN, satisfactory to IDA, has been signed for the management of the&#13;
mapping and acrial photography services by IGNN.&#13;
(d)    Rescarch, Studies and Technical Assistance (US$2.8 million)&#13;
3.19          Rescarch and Studies. At the timc of project design, a large array of simple NRM&#13;
technologies, proven successful under comparable conditions, were inventoried (see&#13;
Implementation Volume on Menu of Technical Interventions). No need for further research or&#13;
studies was identified at this stage, except for the monitoring and evaluation of project&#13;
implementation and impact (see below, paras. 4.18-4.20). During implementation, however,&#13;
problems may occur that should be reviewed by research specialists. Also, new technologies may&#13;
be developed that need to be studied and tested before dissemination. The Niger National&#13;
Agronomic Rescarch Institute (INRAN), which is presently receiving support under the IDA-&#13;
funded Agricultural Research Project, including support for NRM research, will carry out any&#13;
necessarv research and studies as part of its program, using existing financial resources.&#13;
Additional funds (US$0.5M) have been earmarked, however, for activities not included in&#13;
INRAN's regular work program or to be carried out by other agencies, such as studies on socio-&#13;
anthropology, land tenure, and decentralization. Required action-oriented rescarch would be&#13;
included in the project's annual work plan to be reviewed with and approved by IDA. Such&#13;
research could include, for instance, (i) design of cost-effective stone bunds ("diguettes"); (il)&#13;
assessment of animal impact on plant biomass resources; (iii) sustainable watershed revegetation&#13;
(vegetation to be used, establishment, management); (iv) design of cost-effective torrent correction&#13;
work (using stones, wood, cement); (v) selection of species relevant to agro-forestry; (vi) reliable&#13;
techniques for rehabililtating degraded rangeland (pitting, harrowing, animal impact); (vii)&#13;
introduction of North African covered cistems for drinking water; and (viii) together with the&#13;
Agricultural Services Project. research on relevant agricultural tillage and fertilization techniques.&#13;
3.20          Technical Assistance and Consultant Services.  People with technical skills&#13;
required for the implemrentation of this program are not available in sufficient number in Niger,&#13;
neither in government, iior in non-government or private agencies that will be involved in project&#13;
inplementation. In addition to short-term training that will be provided to Project staff, short and&#13;
medium-term technical support will be necessary, at least for the starting years. Qualifications&#13;
being equal, priority should be given to locally recruited staff paid at local rates. Medium-term&#13;
technical assistance (TA) will be sought for expertise in (i) the design of participatory adult&#13;
training programs; (ii) tlhe inter-sectoral planning of community natural resource management; (iii)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; and (iv) the NGO, women and local community participation aspects of&#13;
the Project. This TA would amount to approximately 150 staff-months distributed over the five&#13;
years of Project implementation, with a focus on the first two years. The main purpose of this TA&#13;
would be to backstop arnd develop skills among the staff of the NRMU. Needs for such TA cannot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
be defined precisely until the recruitment of NRMU staff is completed prior to project&#13;
effectiveness. Terms of Reference (TORs) for NRMU staff and, if needed, for their TA&#13;
counterparts, will be included in the Project Implementation Manual. They will explicitly require&#13;
the consultants to transfer their knowledge to their local counterparts in the NRMU and in the other&#13;
participating agencies, and would specify that the success of this transfer wilI be a major factor in&#13;
the evaluation of the consultants' performance.&#13;
3.21          Short-term consultancies will be carried out under the Project for an estimated&#13;
total of 70 staff-months over a five year period. These consultancies will provide technical&#13;
expertise and advice in (i) the different sectors and sub-sectors the Project will be associated with,&#13;
such as agriculture, water, livestock and forestry; (ii) economics; (iii) financial management and&#13;
external audits; (iv) institutional building; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Half of the cost for&#13;
technical assistance will be borne, in the form of grants, by Norway and Denmark as part of their&#13;
cofinancing. In addition, technical assistance will be provided by a consortiun headed by the&#13;
Institute of Geography at the University of Copenhagen to help Niger implement the National&#13;
Natural Resource Assessment component and the National Resource Information Network under&#13;
parallel grant funding from the Government of Denmark. This parallel funding is not included in&#13;
the total project costs.&#13;
Implementation. Management and Monitoring Support (US$4.5 million)&#13;
3.22          The information gathered by the Project staff during implementation, particularly&#13;
through the system of Monitoring and Evaluation and the studies, will be utilized to assist the&#13;
Government in updating and improving the national NRM policy adopted in 1992 as part of its&#13;
rural development policy (para 2.13). This will be done by making the information produced or&#13;
collected on NRM available to decision makers in a treated form; carrying out special studies and&#13;
preparing issue papers and reports; helping in the drafting of strategy or policy documents;&#13;
organizing special meetings and workshops; and participating in the Rural Development Sub-&#13;
Committee meetings.&#13;
3.23          Financial support will be provided to the Rural Development Sub-Committee to&#13;
help them monitor the imiplementation of the Rural Development Policy Framework (RDPF), and&#13;
to work on its regular updating. The funds will essentially support a small secretariat, and pay for&#13;
meetings, report writing, publication and field trips.&#13;
3.24          Support will be provided for the establishment and functioning of Land Tenure&#13;
Commissions in three of the five districts covered by the Project in order to test, monitor and study&#13;
the applicability of the Rural Code du ring the implementation of the CBNRM management plans,&#13;
assess its socio-economic impact, and recommend appropriate corrective measures in terms of legal&#13;
amendments or additional legislation. Support will also be provided to the Permanent Secretariat&#13;
for the Rural Code to help them in setting up the Land Tenure District Commissions and&#13;
monitoring their functio:ning, taking stock of lessons learned, and drafting and processing&#13;
implementation decrees for the Rural Code. The financial support will be for consultants,&#13;
meetings, report writing and publication, and field trips. A detailed budget has been worked out for&#13;
the establishment of the tliree Land Tenure Commissions and a program of work and budget will&#13;
be submitted for the direct financial support to the Permanent Secretariat.&#13;

D. Proiect Costs&#13;
3.25               Total projecit costs are estimated at US$42.7 million on the basis of July  1994&#13;
prices with a foreign exchange component of US$18.0 million or 42 percent. These costs are net&#13;
of taxes and import duties and include physical contingencies estimated at 2 percent of total base&#13;
costs and price contingencies estimated at 4 percent of total base costs. Price escalation factors&#13;
follow the February 1994 forecasts of international inflation for foreign goods and services (8&#13;
percent) and estimnated annual inflation in Niger for local costs (6.6 percent). The breakdown of&#13;
costs by component is summarized below.  All costs, price contingencies and inflation rates are&#13;
based on data collected in July 1994 during the appraisal. Forecasts of inflation rates incorporated&#13;
in the price contingencies are based on the consumer price index indicators. Summary Cost&#13;
Tables, by component and category of expenditure, are shown in Annex 1.&#13;

E. Financine Plan&#13;
3.26          Co-financing of about US$8.7 million equivalent has been confirmed by the&#13;
Governments of Denmark (IDA-adrninistered grant of US$5.0 million) and Norway (IDA-&#13;
administered grant of US$3.7 million) before negotiations. A condition of effectiveness would be&#13;
that the Governnent of Niger has fulfilled all conditions precedent to the initial disbursement of&#13;
these grants (para. 6.3g). The contribution of the Nigerien Government would be US$1. 1 million&#13;
equivalent (in addition to taxes and duties) and the communities would contribute the equivalent of&#13;
US$6.2 million. Therefore, the financing plan stands as follows:&#13;
Table 2: FINANCING PLAN&#13;

Ggvernment                1.1        2.6&#13;

TOTAL               42.7       100&#13;
3.27          The IDA credit would represent 62.5 percent of total project costs and would be&#13;
on standard IDA ternns, with 40 years maturity. The financing plan and the project costs include&#13;
valuation of the labor and materials to be provided by the rural communities for execution of&#13;
community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) plans, based on an opportunity cost of&#13;
CFA franc 500 per person-day. This "equity" contribution by communities to the project will be&#13;
substantial, corresponding to 14.5 percent of total project costs. The Government's cash&#13;
contribution (not including taxes and duties), represents 2.6 percent of total project costs and&#13;
would be used to meet part, of the incremental operating costs. Because this project is the first time&#13;
slice of a long-term progiram whose full benefits wilI not be realized for many years, external&#13;
financing of incremental recurrent costs will not be on a declining-share basis.&#13;

3.29             Civil U'orks.  The IDA Credit will finance US $12.0 million, or 55%  of the US&#13;
$22.0 million estimated total cost for civil works. It will cover skilled labor, material and&#13;
equipment, excluding local labor costs which would be the in-kind contribution of the communities.&#13;
The civil works prograrn consists of a wide variety of small works carried out by communities to&#13;
maintain and/or improve natural resource productivity. It covers works such as soil erosion&#13;
control, water-harvesting, tree planting, bush fire prevention, windbreaks, wells, and grain storage&#13;
facilities. The cost of these would not generally exceed US$20,000 equivalent each including the&#13;
estimated value of labor provided by community members which will represent the communities'&#13;
direct contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
3.30          The entire civil works program will, with a few exceptions, not be appropriate for&#13;
ICB procedures, due to their small size, geographic spread and high transportation costs.  No&#13;
contract is expected to cost more than US$100,000. Contracts above US$30,000 and less than&#13;
US$100,000, for an aggregate amount of US$4.4 million (US$3.6 million IDA-financed), will be&#13;
procured through NCB procedures. The rest of the civil works program includes small works&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$30,000 each, for an aggregate US$8.4 million (US$5.7 million&#13;
IDA-financing), and are unlikely to attract competition by either foreign or local modern-sector&#13;
firms. It will be up to lhe communities, with technical support provided by District Teams, to&#13;
contract for services by local artisans and to undertake procurement of locally available materials,&#13;
following commercial practices -- contracts being awarded on the basis of local shopping&#13;
procedures with price quotations obtained from at least three contractors/suppliers. The District&#13;
Teams would be responsible for verififng and certifying that this procedure is followed. An&#13;
agreement, prepared by the District Team and signed with the community, would determine the&#13;
scope of the works, the estimated costs, and the terms and conditions under which the grant would&#13;
be administered. Grants would first be paid out of the government counterpart funds to eligible&#13;
communities. Payments %vould be made on a tranche basis, provided works have been delivered in&#13;
accordance with quantity and quality agreed upon, and certified by the District Teams. IDA funds&#13;
would serve to reimburse grants paid to communities out of the government counterpart funds&#13;
account, provided these payments are fully documented by the related contracts and certified works&#13;
completion.&#13;
3.31          A specific community participation procurement method will also be used in the&#13;
event of special works cir materials not offered at the community or district levels or in their&#13;
proximity. Procurement of such items would be managed and awarded by the NRMU in liaison&#13;
with the District Teams., according to agreed procedures. It is estinated that ten to twenty&#13;
contracts would be awarded under this procedure cach year (up to US$3.0 million, US$2.7 million&#13;
IDA-financed). Through District Teans, the NRMU would maintain a roster of qualified&#13;
contractors and suppliers with adequate experience, would permit additional applications at any&#13;
time, and would not preclude foreign firms from participating. Standard bidding documents will&#13;
propose a reference price and indicate unit prices and quantities. Contractors/suppliers would be&#13;
invited to bid by way of discounts either on the total or on the unit prices. Contracts would be&#13;
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder based on criteria specified in the bidding documents. The&#13;
NRMU would open bids in public and have full authority to contract. It would justify, however, in&#13;
writing and prior to signing the contract and with reference to the bidding documents' criteria, any&#13;
decision for award. For contracts with fewer than thrce bidders the NRMU would request IDA&#13;
non-objection prior to sigrning the contract.&#13;
3.32          Goods. Goods financed by the project (US$5.7 million, of which the IDA Credit&#13;
would finance US$3.9 million) include furniture, equipment, office supplies and vehicles. Goods&#13;
that can be grouped into packages of at least US$100,000 each would be procured through ICB.&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used. A preferential margin of 15 percent or the&#13;
applicable customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f prices of competing goods would be&#13;
given to domestic manufactured goods in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for al] ICB&#13;
procurement. All bids would be submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on an ex-&#13;
factory basis for locally nmanufactured goods. Goods that cannot be grouped into packages of at&#13;
least US$100,000 each would be procured through NCB, provided the aggregate amount of such&#13;
procurement does not exceed US$2.4 million (US$1.4 million IDA-financed). Small quantities of&#13;
office supplies, consumable materials and spare parts, which are available off-the-shelf and cannot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
be grouped into bid packages of at least US$30,000 may be procured through national shopping,&#13;
based on price quotations of at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount of&#13;
such procurement does not exceed US$1.6 million (US$0.8 million IDA-financed).&#13;
3.33          Service Contracts. Of the total costs for acrial photographs and satellite imagery&#13;
(US$1.2 million), the IDA Credit would finance US$0.5 million. IGNN would be responsible to&#13;
manage the production of maps, aerial photography and satellite imagery. It will be contracting for&#13;
specialized services (aerial photographic survey and satellite imagery) from private firms as&#13;
required, through LIB, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, provided that the aggregate&#13;
amnount of such procurement does not exceed US$500,000. IGNN will execute directly other tasks&#13;
such as map production.&#13;
3.34          Consultant Services. Research and Studies. Of the total costs for consultant&#13;
services, research and studies (US$2.8 million), the IDA Credit would finance US$1.9 million.&#13;
Services would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
(August 1981). Services to be contracted include short and medium-term technical assistance,&#13;
contracted research and studies, and technical and financial auditing. For the district of Boboye,&#13;
the management of all the operations would be contracted out on a sole-source basis, subject to&#13;
Bank's prior approval, with an NGO (ONVPE) with unique experience in this region and expertise&#13;
in the field of assignment. The relatively small value of the contract (US$240,000) wiIl cover&#13;
incremental recurrent costs to continue and expand the NRM program in this district. This contract&#13;
will be for one year and can be renewed subject to satisfactory uerformance.&#13;
3.35          Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for goods and works above a threshold&#13;
value of US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Selective&#13;
post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would apply to about one in three&#13;
contracts. Prior IDA review would apply to consultant contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$75,000 equivalent for firms and US$30,000 for individuals. However, prior IDA review&#13;
would apply below these thresholds for terms of reference,  single-source hiring of firms,&#13;
assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, and amendments of contracts raising the&#13;
contract value to US$75,000 or more for firms and US$30,000 or more for individuals. Contracts&#13;
for goods and services procured under parallel financing arrangements would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the cofinanciers' procurement regulations. All contracts financed under co-&#13;
financing administered by IDA would be subject to Bank guidelines. Finalization of standard&#13;
bidding documents, satisfactory to IDA, for critical procurement of goods and works for ICB and&#13;
NCB would be a condition of effectiveness as part of the Implementation Manual (para. 6.4b).&#13;
3.36          Assurance been obtained during negotiations that procurement of the goods, works&#13;
and consultants' services required for the project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the&#13;
Credit will take place in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA (para. 6. la).&#13;
Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows: (i) prompt reporting of contract&#13;
award information bv the Borrower, (ii) comprehensive semi-annual reports to the Bank by the&#13;
Borrower, indicating: (a) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project,&#13;
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contimgency; (b) revised timing of&#13;
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for&#13;
individual contracts; (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement;&#13;
and (d) a project final report prepared within three months of the credit's closing date.&#13;

G. Disbursements&#13;
3.37          Disbursements under contracts for goods and works costing less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, and disbursements for training, workshops, and incremental operating costs would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditures certified by the manager and the chief accountant of the&#13;
NRMU. SOEs would also be used for expenditures under contracts for consulting services costing&#13;
less than US$75,000 equivalent for firms and US$30,000 equivalent for individual consultants.&#13;
Supporting documentation would be retained by the NRMU for inspection in the course of normal&#13;
project supervision by IDA and by independent auditors. The NRMU would be responsible for&#13;
preparing and presenting to IDA withdrawal applications for all categories of expenditures&#13;
incurred under the project. The IDA credit will be disbursed as shown in Table 4 below.&#13;

3.38          The current disbursement profile for agricultural projects in Niger is 7 /z years.&#13;
However, the present project will disburse more rapidly because it will benefit from the experience&#13;
acquired under other on-going NRM projects in the country as well as the IDA-supported projects&#13;
in Burkina Faso and Mali. It is therefore estimated that a 6-year disbursement profile will be more&#13;
appropriate. A schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 2.&#13;
3.39          IDA will finance 74 percent and other donors will finance 14% of the total&#13;
incremental operating costs. A large share of these costs represents the technical support provided&#13;
by local contractual staff, who wilI assist local communities in the design and implementation of&#13;
management plans. Such assistance will terminate once the targeted communities have been&#13;
organized and trained, their management plans designed and approved, and the main investments&#13;
completed. Afterwards, these communities will be able to maintain these investments and will only&#13;
need limited technical support which will be provided by the existing Agricultural Support&#13;
Services. With its 12 percent contribution to project total incremental costs, it can be expected that&#13;
the Government will be in a position to continue providing support to those samne comrunities, in a&#13;
sustainable manner.&#13;
3.40          Special Account (SA). To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account with a&#13;
maximum total advance equivalent to US$1.6 million, representing about four months' project&#13;
expenditures, would be made available to the project. The Special Account will be at a commercial&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA. The initial deposit to the Special Account would be limited to US$0.8&#13;
million and additional advances up to a total of US$1.6 million would be made available when the&#13;
total disbursed under the Credit amounts to about US$9.0 million. Replenishment requests to the&#13;
Special Account would be submitted to IDA on a monthly basis or when the total debited from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
Special Account amounts to one third of the initial deposit, whichever is sooner. In view of the&#13;
availability of the Special Account, the minimnum withdrawal applications for direct payment by&#13;
IDA would be 20 percent of funds in deposit in the Special Account.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Proiect OrEanization&#13;
4.1          The project organization will be based on the principles of transparency,&#13;
communication and local community empowerment. In order to facilitate project implementation&#13;
and particularly the establishment, implementation and monitoring of the CBNRM plans, a manual&#13;
of simple guidelines and forms would be prepared by the NRMU. This Implementation Manual&#13;
would include a description of the Project components; standard agreements and contracts;&#13;
disbursement forms; guidelines concerning the minimum community contribution; types of&#13;
investments or actions eligible for project funds; the type of project funds available for the&#13;
community, and information on alternative sources of funding. The Implementation Manual would&#13;
be reviewed periodically, based on the feed-back obtained from its users.  A condition of&#13;
effectiveness would be the adoption by the Borrower of an Implementation Manual, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA (para. 6.3b). This version of the Manual shall not be considered as a rigid and definitive&#13;
framework but rather a working tool that is expected to be periodically updated and improved by&#13;
the NNRMP staff in the course of implementation. Ail changes, however, will be subject to prior&#13;
IDA approval before coming into effect. The mechanism for project implementation is outlined in&#13;
the following paragraphs. While a number of bodies, organizations and committees are described&#13;
in these paragraphs, it is important to acknowledge that project will be inplemented largely&#13;
through national institutions, committees and village organizations that already exist. The creation&#13;
of new management structures will be minimized, and only undertaken to improve the consultation&#13;
process and coordination among existing bodies.&#13;
Local Community Level&#13;
4.2          A representative Local Council for Natural Resource Management (LCNRM) will&#13;
constitute the link between the local community and all the outside partners for NRM-related&#13;
matters. Since under the Decentralization Lawv (para. 2.12), only municipalities -made of several&#13;
communities- are recognized as legal entities with financial and administrative autonomy,&#13;
agreements made between local communities and the Government will be endorsed by the Council&#13;
of the municipality where the community is located. Local Initiative Groups (Groupes d'action&#13;
spécifique) may be created by members of the community to carry out NRM-related activities of&#13;
interest to the community and will be eligible to receive Project support.&#13;
Liaison Between Community and District&#13;
4.3          30 Extension Agents. already placed under the IDA-supported Agricultural&#13;
Extension Project, will be actively involved in the NRM Project. They will participate in the&#13;
selection and diagnosis of terroirs, and will, as part of their regular tasks, assist communities&#13;
during the design and implementation of management plans; the dissemination of appropriate&#13;
technologies will be instrumental. As the two projects are complementary, work programs for both&#13;
projects will be reconciled to ensure efficient use of staff time and skills. An additional 35 Liaison&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
Agents wilI be recruited. They will act as facilitators to improve communication between the&#13;
Project team at district level and the communities preparing the Terroir Management Plans. They&#13;
will work closely with the Extension Agents of the area. Liaison Agents will have adequate&#13;
communication skills and knowledge in socio-anthropology, group dynamics and community&#13;
organization. Work of both types of agents at community level will be compleinentary.&#13;
District Level&#13;
4.4           One NF'M District Team (DT) will operate in each of the five districts of the&#13;
Project. Each DT will have a Team Leader, a Monitoring and Evaluation specialist, an accountant&#13;
and two Community Support Groups (CSGs). Each CSG will consist of four technicians with&#13;
skills in areas such as socio-anthropology, social organization, land-use management, agro-sylvo-&#13;
pastoral management, women in development, and land tenure. The role of the CSG will be to&#13;
provide technical support to the selected communities in the preparation and implementation of&#13;
their Terroir Management Plans. In the case of the district of Boboye, the two projects (Dallol&#13;
Bosso Nord and Dallol Bosso Sud) previously financed by CIDA, will be merged under the&#13;
management of one single DT whose task will be entrusted to ONVPE, the local NGO presently&#13;
managing the Dallol Bosso Nord project. An agreement will be signed between the NRMU and&#13;
ONVPE to this effect. The project will work with NRM District Committees consisting of&#13;
members of the existing District Technical Committees (COTEARs, para. 2.16), representing&#13;
central ministries, and members of the District Councils (CONSARs) and Municipal Councils&#13;
(para. 2.12). Their role will be to review and approve the CBNRM plans and monitor their&#13;
implementation. Until the elected councils are in place, the NRM District Commnittees will consist&#13;
of members of COTEARs and community members designated by the community.&#13;
Central Level&#13;
4.5          The exisfing NRM Unit (NRMU) will coordinate and manage Project activities. It&#13;
will be directly responsib]le for (i) assisting and supervising the field operations staff; (ii) managing&#13;
the human resource development component; (iii) carrying out monitoring and evaluation; (iv)&#13;
gathering and disseminating information; (v) capitalizing on past and current experiences; and (vi)&#13;
advising decision-makers on NRM strategies and policies. It will provide technical support to --&#13;
and supervise-- the District Teams in the field, ensuring that the CBNRM Approach is properly&#13;
followed. District Teams however are expected to rapidly take up greater responsibility, and reach&#13;
a high level of autonomy vis-à-vis the NRMU. A NRMU Coordinator, satisfactory to IDA, has&#13;
been appointed. Assurance was given at negotiations that NRMP staff will not be moved or&#13;
replaced before the completion of a three-year assignment period without prior approval from IDA&#13;
(para. 6. 1b). A condition of effectiveness is that, in addition to the NRMU Coordinator, at least&#13;
six technical experts, the procurement expert and the financial expert have been recruited with&#13;
terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.3c).&#13;
4.6          To efficiently manage the NRMP, the existing NRMU will be strengthened to&#13;
include (i) eleven technical experts in one or more of the following areas: agronomy, forestry,&#13;
livestock, socio-anthropology and gender issues, agro-economy, land tenure and decentralization,&#13;
land use planning, monitoring and evaluation, training, and NRM and environmental information&#13;
systems; (ii) one financial and one procurement expert; and (iii) support staff. Four to five of the&#13;
team members will corne -if available- from the key ministries involved in NRM and rural&#13;
development, namnely Agriculture and Livestock, Water and Environment, and Finance and&#13;
Planning; the rest will be recruited on a contractual basis, in consultation with these ministries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
4.7           A Steering Committee for the National Natural Resource Management Program&#13;
(NRMSC) will be set up lby the Borrower. It will consist of selected members of the existing Rural&#13;
Development Sub-Committee (RDSC) (para. 2.16) and community representatives. The NRMSC&#13;
will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agrieulture and meet at least twice a&#13;
year. In addition to approving the project's annual work plans and reviewing its past activities, the&#13;
NRMSC will seek to obtain full support for program activities on the part of all institutions&#13;
involved. Assurance was obtained at negotiations that the Borrower will establish and maintain for&#13;
the duration of the Project, the NNRMP Steering Committee, with a composition and functions&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 6.1c). A condition of Board presentation is that the NRMSC is&#13;
effectively established with a composition and terms of reference acceptable to IDA (para. 6.2a).&#13;
An advisory group comjposed of NRMSC members and donor representatives, will facilitate&#13;
consistency of approach nationally.&#13;
B. Implementation of Project Components&#13;
Design and Implementation of CBNRM Plans&#13;
4.8           Support to Selected Comnmunities. In accordance with the Community-Based&#13;
Natural Resource Management approach (Annex 7), the District Team members and their Liaison&#13;
Agents would work directly with the selected communities, according to the steps summarized&#13;
below and more fully described in the Implementation Manual:&#13;
(a)   launching; of an active awareness and trust building program with the assistance of&#13;
the local technical services at district and community level, and particularly with&#13;
the assistance of the extension agents;&#13;
(b)    election of Local Councils for NRM (LCNRM) by the communities. Election&#13;
procedures will be transparent, clearly defined in advance in accordance with&#13;
Niger's prevailing laws, and endorsed by the Municipal Council when the latter&#13;
exists or by the District Council;&#13;
(c)    diagnosis of terroirs and design of Management Plans by the community members&#13;
supported by the District Teams, the Liaison Agents, and the Extension Agents.&#13;
Assistance from existing of specialized technical services will be sought whenever&#13;
necessary and available. Coordination will be monitored by the current District&#13;
Technical Committee. Issues related to land tenure will be brought to the attention&#13;
of the auiLhorities and dealt with before any further work can take place in the&#13;
community;&#13;
(d)    preparation of an agreement by the LCNRM and the District Team (DT) to be&#13;
signed by the chairperson of the LCNRM, and submitted to the NRM District&#13;
Committee for review and approval. The Plan will specify the actions to be&#13;
carried out, the timetable, the costs involved and the source and type of funding to&#13;
be provided for each action; and&#13;
(e)   implemenliation of CBNRM plans by the communities, with technical assistance&#13;
from the I)Ts and the local technical services. Operations that cannot be executed&#13;
by the cornmunities will be contracted out to private or public agencies. The head&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
of the DT will sign local contracts and approve and process the payments after&#13;
prior agreement of the LCNRM.&#13;
4.9          Technical and Financial Assistance to Oneoing Projects. Ongoing projects that&#13;
have adopted the CBNRM approach and that need extra support, can receive technical and&#13;
financial assistance under the proposed Project. Requests would be addressed to the NRMU by the&#13;
concerned community and the project's implementing agency after agreement of the funding&#13;
agency. Support for activities such as training, design of management plans or supply of&#13;
information, data or maps will be provided by the NRMU or by the service or agency contracted to&#13;
carry out the service, in the framework of the proposed Project. Physical investments that are part&#13;
of a Terroir Management Plan, prepared with the active participation of the community, could be&#13;
considered for funding under NNRMP.&#13;
NRM Support Operations&#13;
4.10         Human Resource Development.  Under the Human Resource Development&#13;
component, the NRMU, with the help of the training expert, will plan, coordinate and monitor&#13;
training activities (Annex 9). The strategy for this component will aim at adapting the training&#13;
program to the changing needs of the Project. The skills gap analysis and module design would be&#13;
subcontracted to NGOs and/or private training consulting firms. These firms would establish a&#13;
database of training resources available in Niger and its neighboring countries (facilitators,&#13;
resource persons, training facilities), which could be contracted for implementation of the modules.&#13;
Such data bases are already being established for Burkina Faso and Mali through the IDA-&#13;
supported NRM prograns in these countries. The Implementation Manual will provide details on&#13;
the objectives of the Human Resource Development component, the different target groups and&#13;
their needs, the training prograns, the training of trainers, the budget, and a list of the existing&#13;
training centers. This information can also be found in the Working Paper on Human Resource&#13;
Development in the Project files (Document no. 4).&#13;
4.11         National Natural Resource Assessment (NNRA).  This component will be&#13;
inplemented by UTA (para. 3.15) with the assistance of a consortium headed by the Institute of&#13;
Geography of the University of Copenhagen (para 3.21). Detailed methodology and procedures&#13;
have been described in a Working Paper available in the project files and will be included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
4.12         Natural Resource Information Network (NRIN).  The NRMU staff member&#13;
specialized in Environment Information Systems (para. 3.6) will supervise the proper functioning&#13;
of the NRIN. The key institutions that will be involved are the Niger National Agronomic&#13;
Research Institute (INRAN), the Niger National Geographic Institute (IGNN) and the Technical&#13;
Support Unit (UTA) in the Ministry of Environment, with the assistance of the consortium headed&#13;
by the Institute of Geography of the University of Copenhagen (para 3.21).&#13;
4.13         Research and Studies. Most of the research will be carried out by INRAN as part&#13;
of its research program under the IDA-supported Agricultural Research Project. Additional&#13;
research not within the mandate of INRAN that may be required will be contracted out by the&#13;
NRMU to private agencies or carried out by other public agencies under an agreement with the&#13;
NRMU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
NRM Policy&#13;
4.14          NRMU staff will provide support to the Rural Development Sub-Committee&#13;
(RDSC). Specific tasks rnay include: providing information, carrying out studies and surveys,&#13;
preparing draft position or policy papers and reports, and participating in working sessions on&#13;
NRM policy and strategy. One of the members of the NRMU will be designated as a team leader&#13;
for formal liaison with the RDSC. In addition, financial assistance will be provided to the RDSC&#13;
to enable them to carry out field visits and organize meetings, working sessions and seminars. A&#13;
budget will be prepared by the RDSC each year and funds will be directly disbursed by the NRMU&#13;
on the basis of the agreed upon action programn and budget.&#13;
4.15          Funds for the establishment and operation of three Land Tenure Commissions in&#13;
three of the districts covcred by the Project, and for assisting the Permanent Secretariat for the&#13;
Rural Code, will be disbursed directly by the NRMU on the basis of an annual work program of&#13;
work and budget to be approved by the NRMSC during the annual review meetings (para. 4.26).&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.16          A Project Implementation Schedule is attached at Annex 3. Actions to be carried&#13;
out in Year-one and Year*-two are clearly defined, but actions to be taken in the subsequent years&#13;
are more indicative than pirescriptive: the bottom-up nature of the project requires that flexibility be&#13;
a keynote from the start. It is to be expected that demand from rural communities for CBNRM&#13;
plans, and technical staffs capacities to respond, will differ from district to district and perhaps&#13;
within districts. The implementation schedule will therefore be adjusted annually in the light of&#13;
communities' demands at the time of the annual review meetings.&#13;
C. C-oordination with Other Proiects and Proerams&#13;
4.17          The proposed Project would be closely coordinated with other ongoing projects&#13;
and programs in the rural sector. Coordination would be the responsibility of the NRMU and the&#13;
NRM District Teams. Particular efforts will bc made to ensure fult cooperation with projects and&#13;
programs closely relatcd to the NNRMP, for example, the USAID-funded Agricultural Sector&#13;
Development Grant (AS[)G 11), as well as the IDA-funded Agricultural Services Project, the&#13;
Agricultural Research Project, and the Energy Projcct. The objectives of the national Agricultural&#13;
Services Program and the NNRMP are complementary; implementation of these two projects will&#13;
therefore be closely coordinated, particularly at the community level. Similarly, cooperation will&#13;
be sought with the Agricultural Research Program. Draft agreements outlining the modalities for&#13;
such cooperation were discussed during negotiations.&#13;
D. Monitorin! and Evaluation&#13;
4.18          Careful and regular monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the Project is needed to&#13;
help decision-makers at aill levels obtain quick and frequent feedback on the implementation&#13;
process, and to make appropriate adjustments whenever required. Because of the grassroots nature&#13;
of the proposed project and its bottom-up approach, details of the exact location, type and number&#13;
of investments at field level cannot be known before agreeing on Comnmunity NRM Plans. The&#13;
Project design is inherently flexible, which makes the role of process monitoring far more&#13;
import2ant, and also more clifficult, than simply assessing the implementation of prescribed plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
4.19          Project monitoring would be carried out using the indicators listed in Annex 5,&#13;
which were discussed during appraisal and agreed at negotiations. The following four primary&#13;
performance indicators will be used to monitor project performance during the annual reviews&#13;
(para 4.26).: (i) number of NRM plans approved by NRM District Committees; (ii) proportion of&#13;
village land placed under the sustainable management systems promoted by the project; (iii) the&#13;
number of fully operational community-based natural resources management plans; and (iv) the&#13;
level of co-financing by local communities. Project monitoring will be managed by the NRMU's&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation expert. Details on both monitoring and evaluation activities will be&#13;
described in detail in the Implementation Manual. Two areas would be the focus of intensive&#13;
monitoring:&#13;
(a) Monitoring of project implementation, assessing the progress made, in qualitative and&#13;
quantitative terms, with regard to the pre-established work programn and budget;&#13;
(b) Monitoring and evaluation of project impact with regard to the project's development&#13;
objectives a,nd expected results. Impact monitoring and evaluation will be performed&#13;
at three levels: (i) the individual investment level, to appreciate the efficacy of each&#13;
tool or teclnology; (ii) the terroir level, to measure the effects of the package of&#13;
actions proposed in the CBNRM plan; and (iii) the overall progran level, to&#13;
appreciate whether the Project institutional, legal and technological support activities&#13;
created the proper enabling environment for success of the project. Impact monitoring&#13;
will be carried out for all the terroirs supported by the Project by the DTs assisted by&#13;
local technical staff. Community members will fully participate in this exercise. A&#13;
more scientific impact monitoring will be carred out by INRAN on a small sample of&#13;
terroirs.&#13;
4.20          A modlel M&amp;E system, adapted to NRM, will be developed before credit&#13;
effectiveness with the assistance of the Sahel Center of Laval University in Canada and a&#13;
consultant expert in monitoring and evaluation. The communities, local and central authorities, as&#13;
well as donor agencies aLre among the important groups that will be using the results of M&amp;E. The&#13;
efficiency of the M&amp;E tool will be annually assessed for further improvements. Internal as well as&#13;
external reviews will be carried out. The adoption of a project monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness, as part of the Implementation Manual&#13;
(para. 6.3b). The Government will maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable the project&#13;
to monitor and evaluate progress on an on-going basis in accordance to indicators acceptable to&#13;
IDA.&#13;
E. Approval Procedures and Financine Mechanisms for Communitv-Based Investments&#13;
4.21          Project Management and Accounting.   A  computerized management and&#13;
accounting system will be established under the NRMU by consultants funded by the Project&#13;
Preparation Facility. The Borrower has drafted a consultant contract, with termns of reference and&#13;
qualifications acceptable to IDA, to design and set up the project's computerized management and&#13;
accounting system, prepare an accounting procedures manual, and train the accountants for the&#13;
Project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that for all expenditures for which withdrawals&#13;
from the Credit account are made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower shall: (i)&#13;
maintain records and accounts reflecting such expenditures; (ii) retain for at least one year all&#13;
records evidencing such expenditures; (iii) enable IDA's representatives to examine such records;&#13;
and (iv) ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual audit, and that the report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
of such audit contains a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs can be relied upon to support the&#13;
related withdrawals (para. 6.1 d). In order to facilitate implementation of the component, an&#13;
accounting procedures manual would be established by the above-mentioned consultant. A&#13;
condition of effectiveness wilI be that the accounting and financial management system of the&#13;
Project has been set up (para. 6.3d).&#13;
4.22          Project Accounts (PA).  In addition to the Special Account (para. 3.40), a&#13;
condition of effectiveness will be that the Borrower has opened a Project Account in a commercial&#13;
bank in Niamey and has made a first deposit of US$400,000 equivalent representing the first&#13;
payment on its financial contribution to the Project (para. 6.3e). Assurance was given during&#13;
negotiations that (i) after effectiveness, the Government will open five District Accounts in a&#13;
commercial bank in the districts of Boboye, Dogondoutchi, Goure, Say and Tessaoua or in the&#13;
nearest location; (ii) no replenishments will be made in the District Account of Boboye unless an&#13;
agreement satisfactory to IDA has been made between the NRMU and ONVPE for implementing&#13;
component (a) of the Project in the District of Boboye, ONVPE has selected and recruited, in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to IDA, the staff of the NRM District Team, and the NRM District Committee&#13;
(NRMDC) is set up, and (iii) no replenishments will be made in the District Accounts of&#13;
Dogondoutchi, Goure, Say and Tessaoua unless the staff of the NRM District Team has been&#13;
selected and recruited in a manner satisfactory to IDA and the NRM District Committee&#13;
(NRMDC) has been set up in the respective districts (para. 6. le). District Accounts would be&#13;
operated under the responsibility of the Project's District Team Leader, assisted by an accountant&#13;
recruited by the Project. Initial deposit from the Project Account to the District Accounts will not&#13;
exceed US$50,000 equivalent. Replenishment of the District Accounts would be made by the&#13;
NRMU from the Special Account and the Project Account, upon reccipt of documented expenses&#13;
approved by the DT Manager and the DT Accountant, and cleared by the LCNRM representative.&#13;
'Te Special Account, the Project Account and the five District Accounts will be audited annually.&#13;
4.23          Disbursement Procedure for Community Investments. Ali disbursements under&#13;
the proposed Project for investments at the community level will be made by the District Unit that&#13;
is managing the Project District Account. For operations that can be directly executed by the&#13;
community, the DT will pay directly for the materials required for such works or, if needed, for the&#13;
wages of skilled laborers, while the community will provide unskilled labor as an in-kind&#13;
contribution. For heavy or specialized works that are contracted out, funds will be administered by&#13;
the DT who will make direct payments to the contractors. However, the selection of contractors,&#13;
the supervision of the works, and the decision to pay the contractor will be made in consultation&#13;
with the LCNRM (para. 4.2). Some communities may set up cooperatives to execute contracts,&#13;
and some NGOs may be interested in executing parts or all of the works prescribed in a CBNRM&#13;
plan. Detailed procedures will be incorporated in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
4.24          Community Saving Funds. Funding under the Project for community investments&#13;
will be provided on a grant basis, even in the case of NRM-related economic infrastructure&#13;
investments (para. 3.9).  Credit mechanisms are not available in most parts of rural Niger.&#13;
However, some of these investments are expected to generate a quick return. In such cases, the&#13;
LCNRM may agree with the community members who benefit from these investments, on periodic&#13;
payments corresponding to the replacement costs of the investments, in a time period comparable&#13;
to the amortization period. The funds collected by the LCNRM under this formula may be&#13;
deposited in a Community Saving Fund and subsequently utilized by the community to finance&#13;
future community investments on a similar basis or through loans to individuals or groups. The&#13;
list of beneficiaries, the amount they should pay and the schedule of payment would be decided by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
the LCNRM for each type of mvestment based on the expected economic rate of return of the&#13;
investment. Training in simple financial management techniques and procedures will be provided to&#13;
the managers of these funds, under a service contract with an NGO presently actively involved in&#13;
rural savings and credit in Niger or in the region. Project funds will cover short-term technical&#13;
assistance and training costs, as well as costs for building and equipping approximately 90 small&#13;
savings offices. An agreement, satisfactory to IDA, will be signed between NRMU and the&#13;
selected NGO, specifying the type of assistance they will provide to the comrnunities, and the&#13;
conditions and procedures for assisting the communities to establish Community Savings Funds.&#13;
4.25          Extemal Audits. The Administrative and Financial Officer of the NRMU will&#13;
maintain all project-related records and accounts, and would have these audited annually by&#13;
independent extemal auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report would include a separate&#13;
opinion on the use of SOEs, the Special Account, the Project Account and the five District&#13;
Accounts.  All accounts will be maintained in accordance with sound and internationally&#13;
recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IDA. The accounting unit will&#13;
provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial performance and position of&#13;
the Project. An auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to IDA on such statements will be&#13;
provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year. The auditor's report will include a&#13;
statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal controls, the&#13;
reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis for Credit disbursements, and compliance with&#13;
financial covenants. The Borrower has submitted a short list of auditing firms to IDA. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that: (i) the records and accounts (Special Account, Project Account&#13;
and Project Sub-Accounts) will be audited for each fiscal year, in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (ii) the&#13;
Borrower will fumish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case not later than six&#13;
months after the end of each such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors,&#13;
of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii) the&#13;
Borrower wil furnish to the Association such other information as the Association shall from time&#13;
to time reasonably request (para. 6. 1f). A condition of effectiveness will be the appointment of an&#13;
auditing firm acceptable to IDA to audit project accounts, based upon a one-year contract to be&#13;
extended on a yearly basis (para. 6.3f).&#13;
F. Supervision, Annual and Mid-Term Reviews&#13;
4.26          Proiect Supervision. Supervision would be carried out in close collaboration with&#13;
co-financiers. One joint donor supervision mission would be scheduled each year at the time of the&#13;
annual review. Other supervision missions could be carried out during the year, jointly or&#13;
separately, but in a concerted manner. Borrowers and program staff from other neighboring&#13;
countries may be invited to join the supervision missions in order to take stock of Niger's&#13;
experience and share their own with the Nigeriens and the donor agencies. Supervision of the&#13;
Project's financial management, accounting and auditing follow-up would be undertaken as a&#13;
separate exercise. Supervision missions would involve, in addition to the task managers, experts&#13;
having skills and experience in project implementation supervision and in areas such as financial&#13;
management, people participation, gender issues, training, and environment. A high level of&#13;
supervision input will be required for effective implementation of this "process-oriented" project.&#13;
A supervision schedule for the first three years of the Project is in Annex 4. Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that each year the Borrower will convene a project implementation&#13;
review meeting with IDA, other co-financiers and regional and local authorities to review the key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
project performance indicators and approve the recommendations of the NRM Stecring Committee&#13;
(para. 6. lg).&#13;
4.27          A Mid-Term Review will be conducted during the third year of the project.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations (para. 6. 1h) that:&#13;
(a)   the borrower and IDA shall conduct, not later than March 31, 1999, a mid-term&#13;
Project Implementation Review to monitor progress of project implementation;&#13;
(b)    no later than six weeks prior to this review, the Borrower shall furnish to IDA for&#13;
its review and comments a report, mcluding (i) an evaluation of progress achieved&#13;
in project inplementation by the Borrower in general, and by its Central, District&#13;
and Local agencies, (ii) an analysis of key problems that have emerged during&#13;
implementation, and (iii) a draft action program to be carried out until the&#13;
completion of the Project; and&#13;
(c)   the Borrower shall carry out promptly the recommendations of the review.&#13;
G. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.28          The Project has been classified under Category "C" for environmental impact&#13;
purposes. The broad objective of the program is to reverse the current trend of land and natural&#13;
resources degradation in order to secure sustainable agricultural production and growth and&#13;
improve the living conditions of Niger's rural communities. As a result, the project, if successful,&#13;
will clearly have a positive impact on the environment. It will improve soil, water and vegetation&#13;
conditions as well as promote biodiversity development.  However, any project aiming&#13;
simultaneously at enhancing production and protecting the natural resource base can have potential&#13;
negative impacts. CBNRM plans will anticipate these impacts and make provision for their&#13;
mitigation. Adequate provision has been made under the natural resource assessment and the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation components of the Project to evaluate the state of the natural resources,&#13;
assess the impact of the Project's intervention, and decide on corrective measures.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1           The Project is expected to substantially improve the quality of life of about&#13;
200,000 people living in five districts and 70,000 more in the rest of the country. It is estimated&#13;
that 80% of the beneficiaries would come from the rural poor. The benefits would include:&#13;
(a)   improvement of agriculture, forestry and livestock production in the project area,&#13;
and establishment of improved sustainable production practices that would&#13;
contribute to better quality of life for the communities concemed;&#13;
(b)    empowerment of local communities, improvement of local management&#13;
capabilities, enhancement of the role of women, and better security of land tenure;&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
(c)    establishment of a sustainable land-use system which would balance production&#13;
against resource consumption and promote restoration of ecological stability.&#13;
5.2           A 1990, World Bank study entitled "Economic Issues in Renewable Natural&#13;
Resource Management" examined the empirical evidence on the economic and financial viability of&#13;
techniques to improve natural resource management.  The study concluded that: (i) many&#13;
techniques are economically viable, although their financial profitability is less obvious; (ii) there&#13;
are enough economically viable techniques to provide a menu of options to clients in each agro-&#13;
ecological zone; and (iii) further adaptive research is required to refine the techniques and tailor&#13;
them more closely to local circumstances. The empirical work from which the above conclusions&#13;
were drawn was almost invariably based on a before/after analysis, by comparing the costs and&#13;
benefits of the resource management unprovement techniques against the initial situation. But the&#13;
initial situation is not static; a with/without analysis to determine incremental net benefits would&#13;
have to take into account resource degradation and declining land productivity that may occur in&#13;
the "without" case. The measurement problems are so difficult that a true with/without analysis&#13;
has seldom been attempted. The above conclusions therefore understate the net benefits of&#13;
improved resource management techniques.&#13;
5.3           The design of the present project was based on an extensive exanination and&#13;
comparison of alternatives to ensure that the proposed approach and technologies used would be&#13;
the most likely to succeed at the lowest cost and level of external support. The design of 111&#13;
natural resources management initiatives in Niger was analyzed during project preparation (para&#13;
2.23). Socio-economic considerations, technologies, institutional issues and management options&#13;
were analyzed and compared. A report containing a synthesis of the results of this analysis is in&#13;
the Project File.&#13;
5.4           The project will have a positive impact on the national balance of payments&#13;
because it will increase production of substitutes for agricultural imports.&#13;
5.5          No overali rate of return was estimated for the project as a whole because (i) the&#13;
scope of the project includes a considerable institution strengthening component for which a stream&#13;
of benefits is difficuit to quantify; and (ii) the participatory nature of the project renders it&#13;
impossible to determine the precise mix of activities farmers will adopt and the overall rate of&#13;
adoption. In order to assess the attractiveness of individual investments and packages of&#13;
investmnents from the farmers' point of view, a financial analysis of the packages of the investments&#13;
promoted by the project was undertaken in three sample locations in districts with varying&#13;
agroecological characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed packages had financial rates&#13;
of return between 16% and 35%. Since environnmental benefits were not accounted for, and shadow&#13;
pricing of labor would lower the economic cost of the main input, it can be assumed that the&#13;
economic rates of return will actually be higher. When other non-quantifiable benefits such as&#13;
those related to the building of institutional capacity in the Govemment and private sector are&#13;
added, the project can be expected to have a high economic return. An illustration of the results of&#13;
the financial analysis of a package of project interventions in one of three locations, Say-Plateau, is&#13;
presented in the following Table 5.&#13;

5.6            In addition to the benefits directly accruing to the affected communities, the&#13;
Government and the people of Niger will benefit from strengthened institutional capacity to manage&#13;
and monitor the natural environment. The availability and quality of data on natural resource use&#13;
will be significantly improved as a result of the project, and trend analysis will provide critical&#13;
information to policy makers in the context of the preparation and implementation of the National&#13;
Plan for Sustainable Development.&#13;
5.7            The project minimizes recurrent costs for the Government.  Implementation&#13;
support will be provided bv local contractual staff, who will assist local communities in the design&#13;
and implementation of management plans. Such assistance will terminate once the targeted&#13;
communities have been organized and trained, their management plans designed and approved, and&#13;
the main investments coinpleted.  Afterwards, these communities will be able to maintain&#13;
investments and will need only limited additional technical support which can be provided by the&#13;
national agricultural support services program.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.8             The principal project risks relate to (i) the willingness and ability of communities&#13;
to commit to the project objiectives and engage in participatory planning and long-term investments,&#13;
and (ii) the capacity of the Government to implement the program.&#13;
5.9         Communities rnay not be fully aware of the seriousness of the threat of environmental&#13;
degradation, especially if occasionally favorable climatic conditions (such as repeated good years&#13;
of rainfall) give a false sense of security and hinder effective mobilization. This risk is addressed&#13;
using periodic awareness-raising and information campaigns, and exchanges of experience among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
villages fàcing varied degrees of land degradation. Communities may also be reluctant to accept the&#13;
planning methods, technological packages and the shared financing arrangements proposed by the&#13;
project. Often farmers are risk adverse and resistant to change. This risk is addressed by: focusing&#13;
on technological packages that are part of or consistent with those adopted by the national&#13;
agriculture extension services, working only with interested groups, involving farmers in the&#13;
planning and selection of activities, and lirniting local contributions to the provision of labor and&#13;
local materials.&#13;
5.10       The Goveriment may not diligently implement programs and laws that may be crucial&#13;
to success. These include the program on decentralization which will help fully empower local&#13;
communities, and the new land tenure law. In both cases, fear of possible social and political&#13;
repercussions may delay Government action. While implementation of these programns and laws&#13;
may be essential to ens'ure sustainability in the longer tern, it is not likely to have a significant&#13;
impact on project implementation. The Government may also face difficulties ensuring cooperation&#13;
among the various agencies, and operation of the institutional arrangements required for efficient&#13;
implementation. These risks are considerable and cannot be totally mitigated. They will be detected&#13;
in a timely manner through a monitoring and evaluation system that will alert project managers to&#13;
emerging problems and. changing conditions, and enable them to address difficulties. Annual&#13;
reviews will concentrate on these emerging problems and work closely with the Government to&#13;
identify corrective action.&#13;
5.11       The project: involves a significant level of risk but is worthy of implementation&#13;
because it will have high environmental and economic returns, help channel resources where they&#13;
are most needed, and leverage additional resources from local communities for rural development&#13;
and environmental conservation.&#13;
C. Sustainability&#13;
5.12          The project promotes  sustainable  agricultural development by  focusing&#13;
comprehensively on production, the impact of production on the natural resource base, and the&#13;
natural resource base's capacity to sustain production in the long-term. The most critical factors&#13;
for project sustainability are found at the community and national Government levels.&#13;
5.13          Community ownership will be the first guarantee of sustainability. CBNRM plans&#13;
will be prepared with external technical and financial assistance, but decisions on the content of&#13;
these plans will rest ultimately with communities, which will be responsible for co-financing and&#13;
managing implementation. Long-tern sustainability at the community level will becorne possible as&#13;
improved land use, production systems and technologies are promoted in communities possessing&#13;
the necessary know-how, and legal, technical and financial tools to properly design and implement&#13;
plans. Despite the promising results already achieved in implementing community-based natural&#13;
resources management plans in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, there exists the risk that some&#13;
communities will not fully commit to the project's objectives and make long-termn investments&#13;
because the effects of environniental degradation are not always well-comprehended and perceived.&#13;
5.14          On the national level, sustainability will depend upon the Government's continued&#13;
promotion of the approaches and activities of the project after project ternination. This is likely to&#13;
happen because the project supports a national programn, the NNRM, that is one of the&#13;
cornerstones of Niger's rural development strategy. In fact, this project represents the first time&#13;
slice of a long-term programn for which the Government of Niger is seeking long-term partnerships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
with donor agencies. The Government envisages that the program will continue for at least twenty&#13;
years in order to reach most of Niger's rural communities. A change in Government policies and&#13;
programns is possible, but this does not appear likely at this tine.&#13;
5.15          The project has minimum recurrent-cost implications. The amount of counterpart&#13;
funds required from the C;overnment is very limited, with a substantial proportion (36%) to be&#13;
provided before effectiveness. Support for field inplementation will be provided by local&#13;
contractual staff, who will assist local communities to design and implement management plans.&#13;
Assistance will terminate once targeted communities have been organized and trained, their&#13;
management plans designed and approved, and the main investments completed. Communities will&#13;
maintain investments using mostly their own labor and local materials and will need only linited&#13;
additional technical support from the national technical support services available at the local level.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
The Monitoring and Evaluation System&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    This annex sumrnarizes the different components of the Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) system proposed for the Niger's Natural Resource Management Program&#13;
(NNRNL). It is a short version of a more comprehensive document that will constitute&#13;
the M&amp;E working paper for the program. It is understood that the present summary and&#13;
the working paper do not constitute blue prints and provide room for regular improvement&#13;
during implementation.&#13;
B. Description of the M&amp;E system&#13;
M&amp;E as a management tool for decision makers&#13;
2.    The proposed M&amp;E system consists in a continuous process of data collection,&#13;
analysis and interpretation to support the decision making. By providing a comprehensive&#13;
framework for gathering and disseminating useful information on performance, difficulties,&#13;
results and impacts, the M&amp;E system intends to be an integral part of the project&#13;
management procedure from the terroir to the national level. Such a system recognizes&#13;
the inherent need for flexibility necessary in any participatory approach, and particularly&#13;
for the NRM program., and therefore, emphasizes a more careful attention to project&#13;
results, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and to establishing strong links between&#13;
conception, design, implementation and impact. Information on these resuits and on the&#13;
links is important for all those involved in NRM, especially for the decision makers at&#13;
community level and for the other NRM key players at the decentralized level.&#13;
M&amp;E Users&#13;
3.    Different types of information are needed for different types of decision makers.&#13;
The M&amp;E system is a tool tailored essentially for decision makers whose tasks were&#13;
carefully analyzed to determine their specific needs for information. In the NNRMP, there&#13;
will be three levels of decision makers: local, district and national.&#13;
4.    At the local level, key players and/or decision makers are the community members&#13;
(farmers, herders, women, etc.), the Local Council for NRM set up in each community,&#13;
and the Local Initiative Groups. As the primary actors of an NRM program, they need to&#13;
have regular feedback on what they have achieved, in comparison with what they had&#13;
planned or expected. l'hey want to compare inputs to outputs, measure the results and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
compare them with what they obtained before, under different techniques, methods and&#13;
approaches. They also want to understand what in the process has affected those results&#13;
positively or adversely so they can make the necessary corrections or do better the next&#13;
time. Detailed technical, organizational and economic results are needed on every action&#13;
implemented in their terroir such as: number and types of activities involved, quantity and&#13;
type of inputs (including labor) used, hectares reclaimed from degraded land, increase in&#13;
crop or pasture yields, costs incurred by them and assistance (technical and financial)&#13;
received, incomes generated, savings made and credits obtained, and conflicts faced over&#13;
land and natural resource issues and solutions adopted. They will compare these data&#13;
with those from their initial situation and with similar experiences in other terroirs to help&#13;
them better measure the overall benefits of NRM operations.&#13;
5.    In order to better carry-out their mandate, Extension Agents and Liaison Agents&#13;
will need feedback, on the way their technical knowledge and communication skills have&#13;
been efficiently utilized, specifically whether (a) their messages were well understood by&#13;
the communities and (b) the advice they gave was sound and produced tangible results.&#13;
6.    At the district level, key decision makers are the members of the District&#13;
Technical Committee i(COTEAR), made of administrative authorities and local technical&#13;
services; the District C'ouncil (CONSAR), formed by community representatives, and the&#13;
NRM District Teams responsible for assisting the communities in the implementation of&#13;
their NRM plans. Their main task is to support the communities by providing a favorable&#13;
environment: technical and administrative advice and support, links with different funding&#13;
sources and other projects, coordination of resources needed for the implementation of&#13;
communities' NRM Plans, negotiation of the NRM plans, and settlement of land and&#13;
natural resource conflicts.  They need information on technical, financial and socio-&#13;
economic aspects, such as number of terroirs participating in the program, schedule and&#13;
level of technical services to be provided, level of government investment, procurements&#13;
and civil works carried out in the district, nature of conflicts, as well as level of execution&#13;
and compliance with the terms of the management plan, and aggregated results of the&#13;
activities at the district and terroir level. From a more strategic point of view, they need&#13;
to have information on the changes occurring at the community level, in terms of&#13;
emerging organizations, managerial skills, financial capacities, socio-economic forces, as&#13;
well as the level of technology accepted, changes in the production system and new socio-&#13;
economic opportunities for the development of the district, and improvement of the living&#13;
conditions in the intervention areas.&#13;
7.    At the national level, key players and decision makers are government and non-&#13;
government agencies, clonors, and political representatives. They require information on&#13;
the general performance of the program, including the effectiveness of the terroir&#13;
management approach, the time required for building up confidence with the communities,&#13;
results and levels of difficulties for preparing and carrying out the diagnosis and the&#13;
implementation exercise. Also required is information regarding community managerial&#13;
skills, attitude of the authorities, conflict management and gaps or inadequacy in&#13;
legislation or regulations, the proper use of inputs, the costs involved, the community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
contribution, the levels and quality of execution, the compliance with the terms of the&#13;
agreement between communities and the district councils, as well as the adequacy of the&#13;
political and legal framework in facilitating the NNRMP implementation, and the changes&#13;
and impact occurring at all levels due to program actions. This information will help&#13;
decision makers at the national level to adjust, harmonize, capitalize and coordinate the&#13;
approaches of the Program and to plan future investments in NRM, as well as to enhance&#13;
and secure the general environment of legislation and regulations in which the NRM&#13;
program takes place.&#13;
Types of Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
8.    There are essentially two types of monitoring: (i) the monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
implementation and (ii) the monitoring and evaluation of impact.&#13;
9.    The Monitoring and Evaluation of Implementation will assess the progress&#13;
made both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  It will compare the effective&#13;
implementation with thie pre-established program  of work and budget.  Differences&#13;
between what was planned and what was achieved are highlighted and thorough analysis is&#13;
made to understand the causes, find remedies and take action to make the necessary&#13;
adjustments whenever required. Several standard systems of implementation monitoring&#13;
already exist and are in use in most current projects. These can be tailored to correspond&#13;
to specific activities, such as terroir management plans or other program components at&#13;
any level. They will be adapted to the NNRMP and presented in detail in the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Volume of the Implementation Manual.&#13;
10.   The Monitoring and Evaluation of Impact will assess the resuits obtained and&#13;
the changes induced by the program's actions and compare the situation before and after&#13;
the project. The monitoring of impact will be implemented in every terroir through a&#13;
participative diagnosis exercise starting at the design stage of the Terroir Management&#13;
Plan, carried out during the entire duration of its implementation process, and continuing&#13;
beyond, for as long as effects and impacts of the actions carried out are still felt or&#13;
expected. This type of monitoring is very important for decision makers because it will&#13;
help them find out whether the program is successful and decide whether to continue in&#13;
the same way and expand the program, modify the current NRM approach, or try&#13;
something else.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators&#13;
Il.   There will be two sets of indicators: (i) the implementation indicators and (ii) the&#13;
impact indicators.&#13;
12.   The Implementation Indicators will measure the level of execution in physical,&#13;
financial and calendar terms.  They will compare activities planned and realized in&#13;
quantitative and financial terms, use of inputs, time scheduled, and difficulties&#13;
encountered. Annual work plans designed at the terroir and district levels will specify the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
number of terroirs involved, the extent and level of awareness and confidence, and&#13;
research activities needed in order to prepare and carry out the diagnosis, as well as the&#13;
types and volume of NRM activities implemented through the terroir management plans,&#13;
the community's contribution and state investment and the schedule of implementation.&#13;
On a quarterly basis, monitoring of what is actually achieved, difficulties encountered and&#13;
alternative solutions will be carried out by the Liaison Agent together with the Community&#13;
and the M&amp;E district agent. An annual work plan at the national level will aggregate the&#13;
work plans of the terroir level and specify the quantitative, financial and scheduling&#13;
aspects of support operations such as Human Resource Development and Public&#13;
Awareness, Studies/ Research and Technical Assistance, NRM Policies, Cooperation with&#13;
partners, National Natural Resource Assessment and Information Network. Monitoring&#13;
of the implementation process of these support operations will also be done by the M&amp;E&#13;
team on a quarterly basis, to help improve the coordination and managerial skills of the&#13;
NRM program team.&#13;
13.   The Impact Indicators. The NRM approach is expected to generate four main&#13;
groups of impacts, each of them contributing to the global success of an NRM program:&#13;
(i) rehabilitation of the natural resources' endowment sustaining the production base; (ii)&#13;
improvement of living conditions of rural communities; (iii) capacity building at the&#13;
community level; and (iv) capacity building for NRM policies, strategies and coordination&#13;
at the national level. A first set of indicators related to the specific problems encountered&#13;
in Niger and expected results from the program actions has been identified. It constitutes&#13;
a general framework for impact analysis. This first set of indicators would be refined&#13;
during implementation, to take into account unpredictable positive or negative effects of&#13;
actions, possible difficulties in the collection of data, or indicators inappropriate to the&#13;
community's understanding of its NRM problem. The general impact analysis framework&#13;
is presented in a diagram at the end of this Annex.&#13;
(a)   Rehabilitation of the natural resources endowment sustaining the&#13;
production base: This is the "starting point" to the NRM Program. The&#13;
objective of the impact analysis is to monitor the current state, evolution&#13;
and utilization of three main natural resources (soil, water, vegetation).&#13;
Expected results would ultimately be the improvement in soil, water and&#13;
vegetation quality and availability for different types of needs. Indicators&#13;
include soil fertility and use, water availability and management, and&#13;
vegetation cover both in quantity and quality. Any NRM action pursuing&#13;
the specific objective of natural resource management will always need to&#13;
take also into account a socio-cultural indicator, the rate of technology&#13;
transfer, to ensure the sustainability of the rehabilitation process.&#13;
(b)   The improvement of living conditions of rural communities by secured&#13;
production and growth is a sine qua non condition for a viable NRM&#13;
program: without positive results on living conditions, the population&#13;
would not be interested in adopting and investing effort in the new NRM&#13;
approach.  Impact monitoring of the living conditions will look at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
indicators, which include intensification of production, increased incomes&#13;
and purchasing power, reduced work load, as well as migratory flows&#13;
which is perceived as an indicator related to the satisfaction of basic human&#13;
needs.&#13;
(c)   Capacily building related to NRM  at the community level. Lessons&#13;
learned from past experience all insist on human resource development as&#13;
an essential factor to the success of an NRM project at the local level.&#13;
Insufficient, nonoperational or irrelevant rural organizations, as well as a&#13;
low level of managerial, technical and financial capabilities, frequently lead&#13;
to low and irregular levels of participation, restricted to the duration and&#13;
initiative of the project.  Indicators related to the development of&#13;
manageiial capacity at the community level have been identified which&#13;
include: organizational structures, existing and applied regulation and&#13;
methodological framework (for savings and credit, land use conflict&#13;
management, and operation of the organizations); technical capabilities in&#13;
different sectors of NRM, and the networking relationship of the&#13;
commuruity with its administrative and economic external environment.&#13;
(d)   Capacity  building   related  to NRM    policies, strategies and&#13;
coordination  of activities at the national level.   The national,&#13;
multisectoral and decentralized approach of a NRM program demands an&#13;
entirely new context for the management of such a program: relations&#13;
between institutions are to be more frequent and operational, new and&#13;
adequate organizational know-how needs to be implemented, flows of&#13;
information need to be sufficient and useful, approaches need to be&#13;
harmonized. Indicators include: existence of adapted legislation, translated&#13;
into applicable regulations disseminated and applied at the community&#13;
level; degree of success of the coordination process, operational and useful&#13;
network of information related to NRM.&#13;
C. Implementation of M&amp;E&#13;
14.         The global structure of the M&amp;E system consists of three components: (i)&#13;
data and information collection, (ii) results analysis and interpretation, and (iii) production&#13;
and distribution of findings and recommendations.&#13;
Data and Information Collection&#13;
15.   The data collection is based on two sources of inforrnation: (1) data coming from&#13;
the NRM Program Activities and (2) data issued by other sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
Data originated by NRM Program activities&#13;
16.   For these data, there will be three types of collection:&#13;
(a)    baseline socio-ecological study ("audit socio-écologique"), carried out on&#13;
a scientific basis, in the first and fifth year of the Program, in a sample of&#13;
terroirs. INRAN, the National Agricultural Research Institute of Niger,&#13;
will be responsible for this activity. It will work closely with specialized&#13;
national institutions such as the Statistics Department and the Land Tenure&#13;
Commissions for specific parts of the study such as the Household Income&#13;
and Consumption Survey, Land Tenure Survey, and Time Survey.&#13;
(b)    terroir diagnosis, carried at the beginning of the NRM  exercise in a&#13;
terroir, will reproduce the terms of the baseline study, but on an empirical&#13;
and participative basis, in every terroir. The responsibility of the diagnosis&#13;
is given to the NRM District Team, who will work closely with the&#13;
communilies and the technical services.&#13;
(c)    regular, systematic and participative data collection related to the&#13;
project implementation process and project impact monitoring. It is carried&#13;
out by the extension service liaison agents and the community, assisted by&#13;
the M&amp;E specialist of the NRM  District Team.  Such a small and&#13;
decentralized structure has been proposed to help develop a local&#13;
evaluation capacity.&#13;
Data Issued bv Other Sources&#13;
17.   Main support items for data collection will be: field note book, wall sheet at the&#13;
level of the community, and basic data sheets for the liaison agent. Survey forms will be&#13;
used for the baseline study.&#13;
18.   Quality control ofthe data collected will be ensured through different mechanisms&#13;
such as: double verification with different groups in the community (users and non-users&#13;
of an investment, women's perceptions, etc.) as well as meeting between liaison and&#13;
technical agents, throughi a M&amp;E network.&#13;
Analysis and Interpretation of Results&#13;
19.   The analysis and interpretation of results is based on (1) a computerized&#13;
information system, (2) programmed analysis with predertimined outputs, and (3) the&#13;
interpretation of the results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
20.   The computerized information system will be a user friendly work facilitator,&#13;
available at the regional level and capable of comparing and linking qualitative and&#13;
quantitative information, according to different types of analysis, to answer basic needs for&#13;
information to support project implementation and project impact monitoring.&#13;
21.   Certain types of analysis have been identified on the basis of the information&#13;
requirements of the decision makers and key players.&#13;
Computerized Analysis for Project Implementation Monitoring includes:&#13;
-     the overview of all ongoing activities established at a terroir level, or&#13;
within an agro-ecological system, a district, a Program component, a&#13;
category of impact or on a yearly basis;&#13;
-     the ability to compare with similar experiences and lessons learned;&#13;
-     the presentation of general information, in the form of a tutorial tool;&#13;
-     the analysis of project execution in quantitative, financial and calendar&#13;
terms, for a terroir, a district or generally at the national level;&#13;
-     the appropriate and effective use of inputs (type, quantity, cost) by activity;&#13;
-     the difference between what has been agreed in the yearly work plan and&#13;
what has actually been achieved; and&#13;
Computerized Analysis for Project Impact Monitoring:&#13;
-     the overview of all ongoing activities established at a terroir level, or&#13;
wlithin an agro-ecological system, a district, a Program component, a&#13;
category of impact or on a yearly basis;&#13;
-     the ability to compare similar experiences and lessons learned;&#13;
-     the presentation of general information, provided in the form of a tutorial&#13;
tool;&#13;
-     the statistical analysis of measures and information collected with .particular&#13;
focus on project's effects/results identified in relation to the activities&#13;
carried out by the community;&#13;
-     the identification and frequency of unforeseen effects related to the&#13;
activities. These unforeseen effects can become sufficiently important to&#13;
modify the reference diagram for impact analysis;&#13;
-     the identification and frequency of risks and negative effects of  the&#13;
activities; and&#13;
-     the comparison of measures and information gathered with reference data&#13;
provided by the baseline study or the diagnosis.&#13;
Interpretation&#13;
22.   Ensured by the M&amp;E agents of the Program, interpretation will give meaning to&#13;
the system's outputs; comments will be formulated according to questions and issues to be&#13;
addressed by the decision makers, and recommendations should always offer alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 8 flO&#13;
Furthermore, three « building blocks » are provided within the interpretation process to&#13;
broaden the understanding of questions and issues to be addressed by the decision makers:&#13;
the motivation of the Government, donors and the rural communities regarding their&#13;
participation in the NRM Program, the reference diagram for impact analysis, and the&#13;
new approaches implemented in this NRM Program which still require validation.&#13;
Production and distribution of findings and recommendations.&#13;
23.   This process is expected to generate answers to the questions formulated at the&#13;
different levels of decision making. Different methods for production and distribution will&#13;
be provided: meetings, wall sheets, summarized data sheets, reports, specific studies,&#13;
videos, etc. Meetings will be held on a monthly basis at the terroir level, on a quarterly&#13;
and annual basis at all levels. The computerized information system will provide access at&#13;
all times for any information for personalized research in the data base. A network in&#13;
M&amp;E will be organized by the agents of the NRM unit at the central and regional level in&#13;
order to ensure the distribution of the M&amp;E results and to gradually improve the&#13;
methodology. Finally, a documentation center specialized in NRM will provide services at&#13;
central and regional levels.&#13;
M&amp;E organizational set up&#13;
24.   Seven (7) persons will be recruited by the NRM Central Unit to implement the&#13;
M&amp;E activities, including two (2) at the central level and one in each district NRM unit.&#13;
They will work in close relation with the Extension and Liaison agents, and with the&#13;
communities. At the central level, collaboration should be ensured with the M&amp;E units of&#13;
the different ministries, NGOs and other projects.&#13;
25.   At the regional level, the responsibilities of the M&amp;E agents will include the&#13;
identification and validation of the measures which are to be selected annually, the data&#13;
collection process, the quality control harmonization and data input, the analysis and&#13;
interpretation of data at the regionai level, as well as the production and distribution of&#13;
findings and recommendation to the communities, the stakeholders at the district, the&#13;
department and the central level.&#13;
26.   At the central level, the responsibilities of the M&amp;E agents will include training&#13;
and the supervision of the M&amp;E team, quality control and harmonization of data, data&#13;
collection at the national level, improvement of the M&amp;E methodology, coordination of&#13;
the M&amp;E work, analysis and interpretation for the central level, coordination of national&#13;
M&amp;E network activities which is part of the National Information System on Natural&#13;
Resources, as well as management of the documentation center.&#13;
27.   Implementation of a new M&amp;E system will require technical assistance during the&#13;
first years to train human resources, to adapt the M&amp;E system to the environment and to&#13;
tune up the computerized information system.&#13;

Risks related to M&amp;E&#13;
28.   These have been identified from  past experiences and the following major&#13;
difficulties will require particular attention during implementation:&#13;
ensure the appropriate level of competence and motivation of hired&#13;
personnel (by appropriate selection and training of personnel and&#13;
productive use of M&amp;E results);&#13;
maintain an efficient data collection process by careful supervision of the&#13;
process at all levels; and&#13;
provide an efficient and useful flow of information produced by M&amp;E&#13;
(updated information, quality ofthe analysis and interpretation according to&#13;
the requirements of the decision makers and key players).&#13;

NATURAL RESOURCES ANI) ECOLOGICAL ZONES IN NIGER&#13;
1.    Water, soil and vegetation are the three principal natural resources that constitute&#13;
the foundation for any agricultural production and rural development. Limited natural&#13;
resources will entail low agricultural production and calls for a more rational and intensive&#13;
type of management.  In this respect, Niger is not blessed by its natural resource&#13;
endowment. This large country with a small population is comparable, in terms of&#13;
agricultural production capacity per capita, to Bangladesh because of its limited or low&#13;
yielding resources.&#13;
2.    Mean annual rainfall in Niger ranges from less than 100 mm in the north to 800&#13;
mm in the extreme southwestem fringe. The country is divided in four main agro-&#13;
ecological zones:&#13;
* the Saharan and Saharo-Sahelian zone, with about 77 percent of the country's total&#13;
land area, receives less than 300 mm annual rainfail and is not suitable for rainfed&#13;
agriculture;&#13;
&#149;  the Sahelian zone, covering 12 percent ofthe land, which receives 300-350 mm annual&#13;
rainfall;&#13;
* the Sahelo-Sudanian zone receiving 350 to 600 mm rainfall and occupying 10% of&#13;
Niger's territory; and&#13;
*  the Sudanian zone prevailing on 1 percent ofthe territory and receiving above 600 mm&#13;
rainfall.&#13;
The rainfall pattern is veiy erratic with long periods of drought, often followed by flash&#13;
floods. Low rainfail combined with high termperatures and winds all year round amplify&#13;
plant evapotranspiration and water deficit. Moreover, average rainfall has been declining&#13;
over the last thirty years, and comparison of the isohyets from the thirties to the eighties&#13;
shows a southerly shift of up to 200 km. over this flfty year period. There is no evidence,&#13;
however, that this trend will continue on a linear basis for another long period, or whether&#13;
it is a cyclical or a recurrent phenomenon. In fact, rainfall has been fairly good over the&#13;
last three years. This past experience, however, makes farmers and herders even more&#13;
sensitive to risk management and encourages a more extensive land use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
3.    Water resources in Niger are important, though insufficiently tapped.  Surface&#13;
water resources come inainly from the Niger river. There is also a network of seasonal&#13;
rivers that change their course frequently and inundate nearby land, as well as numerous&#13;
permanent and semi-permanent swamps. The Niger River stretches over 550 km in&#13;
western Niger and has a flow rate of 30 billion m3 per year. The river offers a gross&#13;
potential for irrigation of 300,000 ha (taking into account areas that could potentially be&#13;
irrigated by water regulated by the proposed Kandadji dam, for which a feasibility study is&#13;
underway). The net irrigable area is estùnated at 140,000 ha. Presently only 12,000 ha&#13;
are under irrigation in Niger.&#13;
4.    Large depressions (dallols) accumulate important amounts of rainwater that&#13;
replenish the water tables and feed Niger's left bank tributaries. However, flash floods&#13;
make this resource difficult to hamess. The Ader-Doutchi-Maggia river system annually&#13;
carries 200 million m3 of water that are partly exploited through the recent construction of&#13;
several dams. The Maradi and Zinder agricultural zones have an irrigation potential of&#13;
60,000 ha. The groundwater resource potential for irrigation is also considerable. Niger's&#13;
large irrigation potential is far from being fully utilized. Despite the remarkable expansion&#13;
of non-govemmental irrigation schemes for dry-season cropping during the 1980s, easily&#13;
exploitable water resources still abound, and ample renewable shallow aquifers remain&#13;
largely untapped.&#13;
5.    Niger has four miain vegetation types which are basically determined by rainfall:&#13;
*the northern steppe in the Saharan zone, with no trees or shrubs and with limited&#13;
vegetation;&#13;
* the steppe with shrubs in the pastoral part ofthe Sahelian zone;&#13;
*the steppe with scattered trees in the cultivation part of the Sahelian zone, and&#13;
* the savanna, with trees and shrubs, in the Sudanian zone.&#13;
Repeated droughts have caused a modification of the volume and composition of natural&#13;
vegetation, partlicularly in the rangelands where animal feed has become scarce. Also,&#13;
massive numbers of trees and shrubs have died due to drought, leaving barren lands. At&#13;
the same time, the northern limit of cultivation has shifted southward with the isohyets.&#13;
6.    Soils are generally poor in terms of structure and nutrient content.  Reduced&#13;
vegetative cover has exposed the soils to increased water erosion through run-off in the&#13;
rainy season, and to wind erosion in the dry season. Runoff drastically reduces water&#13;
infiltration, threatening plant growth, and accentuating the pressure for more extensive&#13;
land use. Slash and burn cultivation methods are still in use, and the shortening of the&#13;
fallow period, due to fist growing popoulation, has increased the soil's propensity to&#13;
erode.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
7.    Nationwide, arable land is estimated at 15 million ha or less than 12 percent of the&#13;
total land area. The area annually under cultivation is about 3.8 million ha, which&#13;
corresponds to a population density of 52 people/km2 of arable land or 200 people/km2 of&#13;
cultivated land. It is est:imated that the human carrying capacity in the Sahelian zone is&#13;
about 60 people/km2 cf arable land, implying near saturation and the need to take&#13;
appropriate measures for a more rational and intensive use of the available land and&#13;
natural resources. Pasture land area is estimated at 30 percent of the total area. Dry&#13;
wooded savannah forests cover 0.6 million ha.&#13;
8.    Niger has 13 types of land use systems, differentiated by several factors including&#13;
morpho-pedology, climate, phyto-geography, water resources, location, and population&#13;
dynamics. These systems are:&#13;
. Plateaux&#13;
&#149; River Valleys&#13;
o Daliols&#13;
o Eastern Plains&#13;
&#149; Bassins&#13;
- Goulbis&#13;
- Rangelands&#13;
- Dunes&#13;
- Oases&#13;
&#149; Komadougou&#13;
* Parc W&#13;
* Peri-Urban, and&#13;
*  Ader-Doutchi-Maggia&#13;
Detailed characteristics of these different land use systems are described in the following&#13;

THE COMMUNITY BASED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH&#13;
A. Proeram Conceit and Preparation&#13;
1.    The broad and long term idea of a natural resource management program rather than a&#13;
sub-sectoral short term project was originally conceived after taking stock of the Livestock and the&#13;
Second Forestry Projects, and promising results obtained from other integrated NRM pilot&#13;
operations in Niger and elsewhere in the Sahel. In 1988, a first pre-appraisal mission for a&#13;
proposed Program (PIGRAR) concluded that the program was too sectoral, being essentially&#13;
livestock-oriented. A PPF (P477-NIR) was granted the same year for an amount of US$750,000&#13;
to assist in the preparation of a more NRM oriented, more holistic, program. As a result, a&#13;
Natural Resource Management Unit (NRMU) was established to prepare the Integrated Natural&#13;
Resource Management Program (PIGRN), rebaptized in 1992 the National Natural Resource&#13;
Management Program (PNGRN).&#13;
2.     Additional funds were made available in 1992 through an IDA-Administered Norwegian&#13;
(rant of US$750,000. Financial support for the preparation of the program was also provided&#13;
from 1993 by the United States (USAID) under the Agricultural Sector Development Grant&#13;
(ASDG 11). Technical assistance was provided by the FAO/Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) to&#13;
help the Government in the preparation of this project. As a result, a Preparation Report was&#13;
produced that constituted the reference document for the second pre-appraisal. France (CFD),&#13;
Germany (GTZ), Denmark (DANIDA), Canada (CIDA), IFAD and UNDPIUNSO were also&#13;
invited to participate, since this initiative was considered as part of the preparation of the long-tern&#13;
multi-donor National Natural Resource Management Program, of which the proposed Project&#13;
would constitute the first five-year time slice.&#13;
3.    The second pre-appraisal took place in April 1994, starting with a launching workshop&#13;
during which a Team Building technique --the ZOPP or Objective Oriented Planning Method-- was&#13;
used with the assistance of a GTZ-funded facilitator. From the Nigerien side, it involved (i) the&#13;
Program preparation team; (ii) representatives of the principal ministries (Finance and Plan,&#13;
Agriculture and  Livestock, Water and Environment, and  Administrative Reform  and&#13;
Decentralization), (iii) Governnent agencies (IGNN, INRAN, Rural Code Secretariat); (iv) local&#13;
NGOs; (v) private agencies and (vi) outside resource persons. From the donor side, in addition to&#13;
the World Bank, French (CFD), German (GTZ) and U.S. (USAID) aid agencies, as well as UNDP&#13;
and IFAD were associated with the workshop. The Centre Sahel of Laval University in Quebec&#13;
and a Montreal-based Canadian NGO (CECI) - both funded by CIDA - and two USAID-funded&#13;
private agencies - the Land Tenure Center from the University of Wisconsin and a Washington-&#13;
based consulting firm - were also involved. Finally, staff from the NRM national programs in&#13;
Mali and Burkina Faso also contributed to the preparation and appraisal process by sharing their&#13;
experiences and assisting in the program design.&#13;
4.    Given the success of the approach used for the pre-appraisal launching workshop and the&#13;
sense of ownership it developed, it was decided to conduct the rest of the pre-appraisal along the&#13;
same lines, as a workshop, with the support of the same facilitator. In addition, a special working&#13;
group on gender issues, led by two women, was set up to ensure this dimension is well taken into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
consideration in all the aspects and components of the Program. These include: staffing of the&#13;
Program units, training, contact with community members, diagnosis and design process, choice of&#13;
investments and beneficiari.es, land tenure and local empowerment and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
This emerging program is intended to become the umbrella for all NRM activities in Niger, and in&#13;
conjunction with the NEAlIPP-CNEDD, will provide a coherent policy and strategic framework as&#13;
well as an operational program context for the implementation of the NRM component of the Rural&#13;
Development Policy.&#13;
B. The CBNIRM Approach&#13;
5.     The NNRMP was designed on the principles of the Conumunity-Based Natural Resource&#13;
Management (CBNRM) Approach or Approche Terroir which consists of a participatory process,&#13;
associating the comrnunity and CBNRM program staff. This approach involves communication,&#13;
confidence building and partnership, leading to the design and iniplementation of a plan --the&#13;
Terroir Management Plan-- for the optimal and sustainable use of the available natural resources.&#13;
This innovative approach incorporates the concepts of "Terroir", "Community" and "Community-&#13;
Based Natural Resource Management Plan" (or "Terroir Management Plan"), where: (i) "Terroir"&#13;
means the land and other natural resources belonging to --or utilized by-- a community whose&#13;
nghts over those resources have been recognized de facto by the other communities living in the&#13;
area; (ii) "Community" designates a group of families sharing, on a commonly agreed basis, the&#13;
same territory on which they live permanently or seasonally (such as pastoralists and fishermen)&#13;
and where they carry out regularly agricultural and/or livestock production activities or other&#13;
activities related to the utilization and exploitation of the natural renewable resources available on&#13;
the said territory; and (iii) "Community-Based Natural Resource Management Plan" or "Terroir&#13;
Management Plan" represents a senies of concrete measures and actions to be implemented. These&#13;
actions could be: commumnty organization; protection of resource and land tenure; land use&#13;
planning; choice of production and protection objectives and production systems; land&#13;
improvement operations (erosion control including stone bunding, agroforestry, windbreaks,&#13;
fertility enhancement); water economy and water harvesting; agricultural production management;&#13;
forest and range management; production storage, processing and marketing, and socio-economic&#13;
investments.&#13;
6.     Under this approach, communities are not simply provided with information about&#13;
available technologies to deal separately with each issue related to their production activities. They&#13;
w'll also be looking at their environment (physical as well as socio-economic) as a whole in order&#13;
to determine how their short, medium and long-term objectives can be met, taking into account the&#13;
potential as well as the limits and constraints of their environment and how to modify it --without&#13;
destroying it-- to better meet their objectives.&#13;
7.     CBNRM  projects are not conceived only to help communities design their Terroir&#13;
Management Plans, but also to help implement them, by providing communities with adequate&#13;
financial resources and technical and managerial back-up, taking into account --and tapping into--&#13;
the already existing operations and projects, such as those dealing with research, extension and&#13;
credit. The CBNRM approach involves several steps, namely: (i) awareness and trust building,&#13;
(ii) diagnosis of situation; (iii) community organization, (iv) design of Terroir Management Plan,&#13;
(v) conimunity governmient negotiation and agreement, (vi) implementation of TMP, and (vii)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. These steps are further detailed in the following pages.&#13;

L'approche Gestion de terroir&#13;
Objectifs:&#13;
L'approche gestion de terroir vise à:&#13;
* responsabiliser les collectivités et les utilisateurs individuels face à l'exploitation des ressources&#13;
naturelles&#13;
* renforcer les capacités des communautés à maîtriser la gestion des ressources naturelles&#13;
(gestion technique, financière et administrative)&#13;
* renforcer les capacités des communautés et des cadres les appuyant à diagnostiquer et planifier&#13;
les actions GRN&#13;
* restaurer et améliorer le potentiel productif des ressources naturelles (sol, eau, couvert végétal)&#13;
&#149; intensifier et mieux sécuriser la production agricole, pastorale et forestière&#13;
* améliorer la sécurité foncière&#13;
* renforcer la coopération entre les différents utilisateurs et faciliter la résolution des litiges et&#13;
conflits.&#13;
Définitions:&#13;
Les termes Gestion des ressources naturelles, Gestion de terroir, et Aménagement de&#13;
terroir sont utilisés indifféremment dans le cadre du Programme national de gestion des&#13;
ressources naturelles du Niger (PNGRN). Malgré les nuances observées sur le terrain et au&#13;
Sahel, signe d'une pluralité ( acceptée) d'expériences en cours, la démarche Gestion de&#13;
terroir réunit les notions de ressources naturelles, terroir, gestion et actions.&#13;
Au delà des divergences de type agronomique, économique, écologique ou sociologique, le&#13;
terroir est de plus en plus considéré comme une unité de base pour la gestion des&#13;
ressources naturelles. Il correspond à l'espace géré par une communauté qui y vit, et qui&#13;
travaille une terre bien à elle; cet espace lui assure, par le biais de l'exploitation des&#13;
ressources naturelles, ses besoins alimentaires, ses revenus, des échanges commerciaux.&#13;
La communauté s'y identifie par une histoire bien spécifique, avec des traditions, des&#13;
alliances, des conflits, et le sentiment d'un destin commun.&#13;
Le terroir n'est donc pas uniquement un concept de géographie physique; il est aussi&#13;
économique, écologique, sociologique et juridico-politique. Il est défini comme « une&#13;
entité spatiale gérée traditionnellement par une communauté villageoise ou pastorale, qui y&#13;
exerce des droits d'occupation et d'exploitation fondés sur une responsabilité acceptée et&#13;
une compétence reconnue par tous les utilisateurs du terroir (Rochette, 1994).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
La gestion (incluant l'aménagement) du terroir vise l'utilisation durable et la plus&#13;
rationnelle possible de l'ensemble des ressources du terroir (ressources naturelles,&#13;
humaines, animales, financières,etc. (Rochette, 1994). Elle réfère aux méthodes de&#13;
planification, exécution, suivi, évaluation, et organisation des ressources requises. Le Plan&#13;
d'aménagement de terroir (PAT) est un document utile et pragmatique, qui permet à la&#13;
communauté de déterminer ses objectifs à court, moyen et long termes, en fonction d'un&#13;
diagnostic qu'elle aura posé sur le potentiel de ses ressources, les contraintes de son&#13;
environnement et des mesures qu'elle entend prendre. Le PAT offre un cadre transparent&#13;
de discipline et de rigueur, tout en laissant suffisamment de flexibilité pour permettre à la&#13;
communauté de tirer profit des expériences et effectuer les ajustements nécessaires.&#13;
Le Plan d'aménagement (ou de gestion) du terroir intègre des actions d'aménagements du&#13;
terroir à des actions de production agro-sylvo-pastoral, de création d'infrastructures socio-&#13;
éconorniques et de développement des ressources humaines de la communauté. Par&#13;
exemple, ces actions peuvent être: l'organisation de groupes spécifiques au sein de la&#13;
communauté, des mesures de protection des ressources naturelles, l'aménagement et&#13;
l'affectation des terres, l'intensification des systèmes de production, la gestion collective&#13;
des forêts, l'entreposage, la mise en marché du bois, des puits pour l'eau potable.&#13;
Le Plan d'aménagement du terroir (PAT) regroupe dans des documents destinés à&#13;
l'usage de l'encadrement et de la cormmunauté, l'ensemble des actions qui contribuent à&#13;
une utilisation durable et la plus rationnelle possible de l'ensemble des ressources du&#13;
terroir, précise les objectifs de la comrnmunauté, les priorités qu'elle se donne, les&#13;
délimnitations de l'espace terroir qui est le sien, les contraintes à lever. L'ensemble du&#13;
processus de préparation d'un PAT est contr_lé par les communautés.&#13;
Il est établi dans une perspective à long terme et est traduit en programmes annuels&#13;
d'actions, avec budgets, calendriers, ressources requises et dispositions d'engagement avec&#13;
les partenaires.&#13;
Le Plan d'aménagement du terroir fait l'objet d'un engagement formel entre la&#13;
communauté et le CONSAR, Conseil d'arrondissement mis en place dans le cadre de la&#13;
décentralisation pour régler par ses délibérations, les affaires considérées comme de&#13;
l'intérêt de l'arrondissement. En attendant le processus de mise en place de cette institution&#13;
décentralisée, le COTEAR élargi joue ce rôle.&#13;
Enfin, il faut aussi rappeler que le plan d'aménagement du terroir est à l'échelle de la communauté&#13;
rurale l'équivalent de l'aménagement du territoire au niveau national et régional, à savoir, un&#13;
instrument de politique spatiale qui vise le développement équilibré d'un espace déterminé, qui&#13;
part de l'intérêt général et qui essaie d'harmoniser les intérêts des différents sous-groupes qui&#13;
composent son entité sociale. Il doit donc y avoir articulation entre les PAT et les schémas&#13;
d'aménagement du territoire, là où ils existent. Ainsi, l'approche gestion des terroirs est&#13;
fondamentalement de type participative, flexible et itérative, ascendante, décentralisée, et&#13;
multisectorielle.&#13;

La mise en oeuvre de la démarche Gestion de terroir&#13;
Le choix des zones d'intervention pour le PNGRN&#13;
Treize systèmes agro-écologiques ont été identifiés au Niger et une brève présentation&#13;
synoptique se trouve en annexe 6. Ces systèmes sont définis selon leurs caractéristiques&#13;
phyto-géographiques, morpho-pédologiques, hydrauliques, ainsi que par la pression&#13;
démographique, le niveau de désenclavement, le mode d'utilisation des ressources&#13;
naturelles et le niveau de pression sur ces ressources.&#13;
Le choix des zones d'intervention, au moment de la préparation du PNGRN, a tenu compte&#13;
des critères suivants&#13;
-     le soulagement de la pauvreté;&#13;
-     des zones homogènes afin de s'assurer de la prise en considération des&#13;
problématiques majeures pour éviter les choix arbitraires;&#13;
-     l'existence des projets majeurs couvrant de vastes espaces et qui ne justifierait pas&#13;
l'implantation d'un autre projet pouvant apparaître concurrent; et&#13;
-     le problème de sécurité pour la circulation des personnes et pour la motivation des&#13;
communautés concernées.&#13;
Les étapes pour la mise en oeuvre de la démarche PA T&#13;
Pour préparer ces PAT, une démarche générale a été esquissée au cours des différentes&#13;
conférences internationales des années 88 - 94, sur la base des nombreuses expériences-&#13;
pilotes de développement rural menées par les ONG, les services gouvernementaux et les&#13;
bailleurs de fonds. Cette démarche comporte huit étapes présentée au tableau suivant et&#13;
détaillées dans le Manuel de procédures du PNGRN.&#13;

THE USAID - SUPPORTED&#13;
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT GRANT&#13;
The Agriculture ,Sector Development Grant Program, Phase II (ASDG II)&#13;
involves UD$28 million of USAID funding aimed at contributing to the development&#13;
objective of increasing agricultural production and rural household income in Niger. More&#13;
specifically, the program's purpose is to enhance the ability of rural inhabitants to gain&#13;
control over the resources they habitually use, and to manage and profit from them in a&#13;
sustainable manner. Of the total grant funds, US$20 million are dedicated to budgetary&#13;
support to the Government of Niger and the establishment of an NGO/private sector&#13;
fund, while the remaining US$8 million are for funding a technical assistance project&#13;
which provides support in areas such as training, studies, commodities, long- and short-&#13;
term technical assistance., and policy impact evaluation. Since March 1993, project&#13;
assistance has targeted activities which: increase land and resource tenure security;&#13;
improve relations between local communities and government extension staff (especially&#13;
foresters); foster decentralization of decision-making in natural resource management&#13;
(NRM); and facilitate legal recognition of community-based organizations dealing with&#13;
NRM. A special project unit was established in early 1995 for the purpose of managing&#13;
the NGO/private sector fund which will provide small grants to NGOs, small private firms&#13;
and community organizations operating in the NRM field.&#13;

Niger&#13;
Projet de gestion des ressources naturelles&#13;
Formation et développement des ressources humaines (DRH)&#13;
Justification&#13;
1)    L'introduction de l'approche «Gestion des ressources naturelles» (GRN) comme un des&#13;
axes stratégiques majeurs en matière de développement rural au Niger repose sur un important&#13;
changement d'attitudes et sur l'acquisition de connaissances et capacités nouvelles aussi bien chez&#13;
les agents d'encadrement (au sens large), le personnel technique et administratif qu'au sein des&#13;
communautés rurales elles-mêmes.&#13;
2)     Les visites d'investigation menées au cours de la phase préparatoire du PNGRN au sein&#13;
d'un certain nombre de structures (projets, services de l'Etat, communautés rurales) impliquées&#13;
dans le domaine de la GRN font ressortir une insuffisance marquée en matière de formation. Ces&#13;
insuffisances se présentent tant en termes de quantité qu'en terme de qualité.&#13;
Souvent les projets ne disposent pas de ressources importantes pour le développement des&#13;
ressources humaines. Leurs activités de formation ne prévoient pas toujours répondre aux besoins&#13;
du personnel technique, des villageois ou d'autres collaborateurs. Les modules ne sont pas toujours&#13;
adaptés aux spécificités des groupes-cibles, ou à la nature des insuffisances observées. Souvent la&#13;
formation est abandonnée en cours de processus.&#13;
La plupart des responsables de projets reconnaissent ces insuffisances notoires et manifestent leur&#13;
intérêt face à un système adapté de formation qui serait capable de lever ces insuffisances.&#13;
3)     Parmi les structures de formation actuellement existantes, peu d'entre elles sont en mesure&#13;
de répondre aux besoins nouveaux de la GRN. En effet, il sera beaucoup plus question de&#13;
formation continue, active et s'adressant aux adultes que de formation classique conventionnelle.&#13;
On sait toutefois que des individus, des projets, des ONG, certaines institutions au Niger, de même&#13;
que des structures émergentes dans la sous-région (Burkina Faso, Mali, etc.) pourraient être&#13;
étoffées et mieux exploitées.&#13;
Pour toutes ces raisons, la mise en oeuvre de l'approche GRN doit être accompagnée de la mise en&#13;
oeuvre au plan national cl'un programme global de développement des ressources humaines visant&#13;
l'ensemble des différents acteurs impliquées à la GRN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 9&#13;

Définition&#13;
Les concepts de formation et de développement des ressources humaines réfèrent à un ensemble&#13;
d'activités variées comme la formation formelle, l'information, la vulgarisation, la formation des&#13;
formateurs, et la sensibilisation des groupes. Le programme de développement des ressources&#13;
humaines tel qu'envisagé dans le cadre du PNGRN comportera particulièrement:&#13;
*  des activités de formation continue, de courte durée, réparties en des sessions diverses, avec&#13;
des modules spécifiques;&#13;
*  des activités d'information/sensibilisation visant elles aussi différents groupes-cibles ; et&#13;
*  des activités de communication.&#13;
Objectifs du volet Formation /DRH&#13;
1)     Au cours de cette première phase du PNGRN, la formation vise à rendre les différents&#13;
acteurs (communautés, agents d'encadrement au sens large) aptes à démarrer les activités&#13;
de GT/GRN et à progressivement étendre leurs actions dans ce domaine.&#13;
2)     Le montage du volet doit viser par ailleurs à valoriser et renforcer les ressources existantes&#13;
en matière de capacités de formation (infrastructures et compétences).&#13;
Les groupes-cibles&#13;
La gamme des intervenants en matière de GRN est relativement large. Ces intervenants ont été&#13;
classés en groupes-cibles, selon leurs spécificités socio-professionnelles et l'échelle de leurs&#13;
interventions (local, régional et national).&#13;
La démarche deformation /DRH au sein du PNGRN&#13;
Les 4 étapes de toute activité de formation J DRH en GRN sont les suivantes:&#13;
1. Identification des insuffisances ou défaillances au sein d'une structure de fonctionnement&#13;
(groupe-cible) GRN.&#13;
2. Analyse de ces insuffisances en relation avec la compétences requises, et manquantes. (Skill Gap&#13;
Analysis).&#13;
3. Conception à la carte des modules de formation.&#13;
4. Mise en place des ressources requises pour délivrer le module de formation. Suivi et Evaluation&#13;
immédiat et a posteriori des résultats et retour à étape 1, pour assurer un processus continu de&#13;
formation.&#13;

Organisation du volet Formation /DRH&#13;
L'exécution des différentes étapes prévues par la démarche de formation / DRH repose sur une&#13;
dynamique souple, appelée à répondre à des besoins évolutifs, de différents niveaux, sur un vaste&#13;
territoire et pour des besoins de divers types.&#13;
Face à ces impératifs, la nécessité d'un organe de coordination devant constituer l'interface entre&#13;
d'une part la demande exprimée par les différents groupes-cibles et, d'autre part, les structures de&#13;
prestation de formation existantes dans le pays, ou la sous-région, s'impose. Cet organe de&#13;
coordination sera l'Ensemblier, ou la capacité de formation du PNGRN.&#13;
Cet Ensemblier sera chargé de la gestion du volet Formation / DRH et de la coordination de&#13;
l'ensemble des activités à entreprendre dans ce cadre. Il fera appel à des prestataires de service&#13;
selon les différents besoins de formation.&#13;
L'Ensemblier est membre à part entière de la CGRN, et traduit en terme opérationnel la fonction de&#13;
formation/DRH attribuée à la CGRN.&#13;
Responsabilités de l'ensemblier&#13;
Les responsabilités de l'Ensemblier sont:&#13;
*  tenir à jour un répertoire sur les ressources disponibles au pays et dans la sous-région, pour&#13;
des prestations de formation;&#13;
*  identifier les insuffisances et les compétences requises, permettant de préciser les besoins en&#13;
formation auprès des différents groupes-cibles;&#13;
* superviser le développement des modules de formation, cette dernière activité étant confiée aux&#13;
prestataires de formation;&#13;
*  se tenir à jour sur les plus récents développements en matière de concept GRN, de techniques&#13;
de formation des adultes, de méthodologie de formation, et de prestataires de formation;&#13;
*  veiller au  recrutement, à la coordination, et à la supervision  des prestataires de&#13;
service;&#13;
*  superviser la conception des campagnes de sensibilisation;&#13;
*  coordonner les activités de formation, sensibilisation et communication avec les autres&#13;
fonctions de la CGRN;&#13;
*  veiller à assurer la logistique requise pour le bon déroulement des séances de formation ; et&#13;
*  demeurer en contact avec eux vis-à-vis des projets GT/GRN au Sahel (particulièrement au&#13;
Burkina Faso et au Mali, Bénin, etc.).&#13;
Composition de l 'ensemblier&#13;
L'Ensemblier sera composé de deux cadres de haut niveau, recruté sous statut contractuel, dans&#13;
des champs d'expérience professionnelle liés à la pédagogie / formation des adultes et à la&#13;
communication. Comme leur mandat correspond à des tâches relativement nouvelles au Niger, ils&#13;
bénéficieront de l'appui d'une assistance technique ponctuelle pour les aider au cours des&#13;
premières années à développer leur capacités en relation avec le mandat qui leur est confié. Cette&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
assistance technique pourra les aider à identifier avec eux, leurs insuffisances et leurs propres&#13;
besoins en formation (ex dans les domaines des méthodes de formation des adultes, de la gestion de&#13;
la formation, et de la conception de programmes de formation).  Le statut contractuel de&#13;
l'ensemblier ainsi que le choix de confier la livraison de la formation à des prestataires de services&#13;
vise à développer et progressivement renforcer des capacités nationales appartenant au secteur&#13;
privé, dans les domaines des services divers liés à la formation et au DRH.&#13;
Besoins en assistance technique&#13;
Le rôle d'interface est nouveau au Niger et pour remplir efficacement cette fonction, l'Ensemblier&#13;
aura besoin d'appuis techniques ponctuels, en termes substantiels au cours des premières années du&#13;
PNGRN, afin d'être en mesure de répondre à la demande du PNGRN (la formation est une&#13;
fonction essentielle en début de programme).&#13;
Les domaines d'expertise requis ne sont pas encore précisés; ils varieront selon les compétences du&#13;
personnel recruté pour l'Ensemblier. On pense que l'appui technique pourrait se situer dans les&#13;
domaines suivants:&#13;
* techniques de formation des adultes;&#13;
* gestion de la formation (logistique, contrôle, développement du programme);&#13;
*  conception de matériel pédagogique adapté ; et&#13;
* techniques de communication.&#13;
L'assistance technique prévue au volet formation pourra également être sollicitée et mise à profit&#13;
pour assurer un appui aux prestataires de services, afin de renforcer leurs capacités.&#13;
Echéancier&#13;
La formation sera un tremplin essentiel au lancement des actions des différents acteurs engagés&#13;
dans le PNGRN. Pour assurer un démarrage rapide de la composante PAT, l'Ensemblier devra&#13;
cibler en priorité la formation des équipes d'encadrement terrain (EMP et AT), tout en mettant au&#13;
point les programmes de sensibilisation des autorités locales, régionales. Interviendront ensuite les&#13;
formations de tous les autres acteurs directement ou indirectement engagés dans le processus du&#13;
PNGRN, au fur et à mesure de leur entrée en action.&#13;
L'atelier de lancement du PNGRN permettra à l'Ensemblier de démarrer son programme de&#13;
sensibilisation du grand public à l'échelle nationale. Ces activités de sensibilisation se poursuivront&#13;
sur une base régulière et s'étofferont progressivement.&#13;

LAND TENURE AND LOCAL COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT&#13;
Land Tenure&#13;
1.    Rural lands in Niger have essentially been managed according to traditional and&#13;
customary land tenure rules, based on family ownership of the land and individual land use&#13;
- rather than property - rights. In some cases, land belongs to a small group of land&#13;
owners in the community and is lent to other community members in exchange for a&#13;
percentage of the harvest. Community land is administered by local chiefs. As long as&#13;
land was plentiful, land tenure security was not a serious issue. Shifting cultivation did not&#13;
require any long-term investment which would have required some form of tenure&#13;
security.&#13;
2.    This situation has, however, evolved over the last thirty years under the effects of&#13;
rapid population growth and repeated droughts.  Arable land became scarce and&#13;
competition for it increasingly frequent. As a result, conflicts among communities, within&#13;
communities, and between farmers and herders developed, often ending tragically. A&#13;
USAID-supported study carried out in six districts by the Land Tenure Center indicated&#13;
that between 1989 and 1993, 294 conflicts involving agricultural land occurred, of which&#13;
195 were related to ownership, 39 to inheritance, and 29 to land property delimitation.&#13;
The same study identified 121 conflicts related to pastoral activities:  70 about the&#13;
delimitation of grazing areas, 22 about passage rights, 23 about animal damage to crops,&#13;
and 6 about water points.&#13;
3.    Between 1960 and 1987, under the regimes of President Diori (1960-1974) and&#13;
President Kountché (1974-1987), a series of laws on land tenure were passed, aimed&#13;
essentially at reducing the powerful role of traditional chiefs, strengthening the role of&#13;
central government, and giving the state ownership over lands declared vacant. In 1987,&#13;
the Government of Niger, with the assistance of several aid agencies, particularly USAID,&#13;
FAO and IDA, initiated a very ambitious task: the preparation and implementation of a&#13;
Rural Code. The process was marked by many consultations, meetings, seminars, and&#13;
workshops, with wide representation of the members of civil society and local and&#13;
regional authorities. The Code was approved on March 2, 1993 by ordinance. The&#13;
purpose of the Code is (i) to establish the judicial framework for agro-sylvo-pastoral&#13;
activities in the perspective of land use management, environmental protection, and human&#13;
development, (ii) to provide security for rural operators by recognizing their rights; and&#13;
(iii) to promote development through rational organization of the rural world. The Rural&#13;
Code considers that security of land tenure in agriculture is a sine qua non for rational and&#13;
sustainable development of this sector.&#13;
4.    The Rural Code constitutes a legal breakthrough in Niger and the Sahelian Region.&#13;
It provides a broad framework, establishing rules for the access, use and management of&#13;
natural resources, principally land, water, forests, and wildlife. It deals with land tenure as&#13;
well as land use and management. The code recognizes property rights (collective or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;

individual) of farmers, taking into consideration existing customary as well as modern&#13;
appropriation modes, and therefore provides them with land tenure security. Access rights&#13;
to pastoral and water resources are recognized for pastoral communities, who also have&#13;
priority rights on specific pastoral territories they have traditionally occupied ("terroirs&#13;
d'attache") and property rights over areas of settlement inside the "terroir d'attache".&#13;
The Code insists on the notion of consultation with the people when public actions are&#13;
taken for the execution of collective investments. The Rural Code promotes the creation&#13;
of Land Tenure Commissions at district level that will be competent to determine land&#13;
tenure rights and identify land uses. The Code is complemented by a Water Code&#13;
(promulgated in 1993) and a Forestry Code (under revision), providing Niger with a set of&#13;
laws regulating access and use of rural natural resources.&#13;
5.    In the context of this project, the Rural Code constitutes a positive step forward,&#13;
as it provides access to private property and, therefore, land tenure security. Certain&#13;
issues, however, remain too broadly defined and will be addressed through complementary&#13;
legal texts and implementing decrees, presently under preparation. These issues are:&#13;
(i)   the rights and security for farmers who do not own land but who have been&#13;
farming for generations on land belonging to the chief or other members of the&#13;
community, as there is no provision for concessions or long-termn rental rights.&#13;
Other laws, however, such as the Civil Code, are addressing this issue;&#13;
(ii)   the definition of vacant or unmanaged land: the Code states that any land&#13;
not put under management for more than three consecutive years can be&#13;
termporarily lent to another farmer.  It does not specify however what is&#13;
considered as being "under management," as the practice of shifting cultivation&#13;
leaves land fallow for long periods of time. A text is presently under preparation&#13;
which will lead to a legal definition;&#13;
(iii)  the definition of "terroir d'attache" for the pastoralists: A study is being&#13;
initiated which will lead to a legal text.&#13;
6.    The Government is strongly committed to implement its land tenure policy, but&#13;
realizes that a test phase is necessary in order to verify the applicability of the Rural Code&#13;
on a small scale basis and propose the necessary adjustments through implementation&#13;
decrees or to recommend amendments before implementing it nationwide. For that&#13;
purpose, it has requested donor support to install Land Tenure Commissions in seven&#13;
districts on a pilot basis. Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have already agreed&#13;
to finance four Land Tenure Commissions. USAID has also earmarked funds for training&#13;
the members of these commissions. IDA would provide additional support to the process&#13;
in the framework of the proposed project.&#13;

Decentralization and Local Community Empowerment&#13;
7.   Individual ownership of land and resources cannot solve all natural resource&#13;
management problems, as many of these resources are community-owned. Crop land can&#13;
be - and de facto always has been - managed at the individual level. However, pastoral&#13;
and forest lands, water resources and infrastructure continue to be community or public&#13;
property, and their management and use in Niger is also often collective.  Local&#13;
communities nonetheless do not have the legal identity and power to administer these&#13;
resources, that are therefore considered as everybody's and nobody's property.  In the&#13;
early years of independence in 1964, Niger addressed these issues by passing the first&#13;
decentralization law, giving districts legal identify and financial autonomy. However, this&#13;
law and the subsequent amendments were never fully implemented.&#13;
8.    Under the new democratic government, a new "Law determining the fundamental&#13;
principles of administration of districts and municipalities" (the Decentralization Law) was&#13;
adopted by the Government in October 1993 and ratified by the National Assembly in&#13;
September 1994.  Under the Decentralization Law, districts and municipalities will&#13;
become legal entities as "territorial communities." They will have the responsibility for&#13;
local finances and the management of local public services and community assets.&#13;
Districts and municipalities will be represented by elected councils. The role of the future&#13;
District Councils (CONSARs) is important to the proposed project, as decisions will be&#13;
taken at the district level regarding the support to be provided to local communities. The&#13;
decisions will be taken jointly by central government representatives - the sous-préfets -&#13;
and the district councils. Similar autonomous setups at the municipal level - the municipal&#13;
councils - are also planned under the same law. Such autonomy is not considered under&#13;
the present law for the local community level (villages or terroirs), but this is expected to&#13;
be the next step in decentralization. Such a step is currently being pursued with the&#13;
support of the USAID-funded Agriculture Sector Development Grant, Phase II.&#13;
9.    In a study jointly funded by CILSS and USAID through ASDG II, the need and&#13;
the options for empowering local communities through the legal recognition of&#13;
decentralized NRM management entities such as village land use committees or local&#13;
councils for NRM (Comités de Gestion de Terroir) were documented and explored. In&#13;
June 1994, a major regional conference was again organized by the Club du Sahel and&#13;
CILSS on the themes of decentralization and land tenure in relation to improved strategies&#13;
for NRM and sustainable rural development. Niger was a major contributor to the most&#13;
recent regional conference organized in Praia, and shared its experience gained since 1989&#13;
with the development and adoption of the Rural Code and the promotion of community&#13;
participation in NRM. In November 1994, the Rural Development Sub-Committee&#13;
examined this study and decided to research this question in more detail, in order to&#13;
pursue the legalization of such community-level committees as a means to empower local&#13;
communities and promote their participation in NRM decision-making. Development of&#13;
such legislation would be fully consistent with the country's rural development policy&#13;
framework.&#13;

10.   Land tenure issues relevant to natural resource management are dealt with&#13;
essentially by five government structures: (i) the Permanent Secretariat for the Rural&#13;
Code, within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, which was responsible for the&#13;
preparation of the Rural Code and is in charge of preparing its implementation decrees. It&#13;
will also be responsible for their implementation; (ii) the Interior Ministry, which holds&#13;
power over the implementation of land tenure legislation and environmental protection&#13;
through its representatives at regional and district levels (Préfets and Sous-Préfets), while&#13;
traditional authorities, particularly canton and village chiefs, often act as auxiliaries of the&#13;
central administration in land disputes; (iii) the Ministry of Justice, which is also in charge&#13;
of dealing with all land disputes if a first phase of conciliation by the traditional local chiefs&#13;
fails; (iv) the Land Use Planning Department under the Ministry of Equipment; and (v)&#13;
the Regional Development Department within the Ministry of Finance and Planning.&#13;
Under the present project, issues relating to land tenure at the community level will be&#13;
identified and resolved by the appropriate authorities before grants are made for the&#13;
implementation of Community-Based Natural Resource Management Plans.&#13;

            Niger - Natural Resource Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Rural
            Resource Management Project is to slow down, stop and
            ultimately reverse the current process of land and natural
            resource degradation in order to secure sustainable
            agricultural production and growth, alleviate poverty and
            improve the living conditions of Niger's rural
            communities. In addition, the project has two specific
            objectives: 1) to assist selected rural communities in
            different agro-ecological zones in designing and
            implementing management plans for their lands and provide
            them with the necessary know-how, information, technical and
            financial resources and the proper institutional and legal
            framework to successfully carry out such an endeavor; and 2)
            to assist the government in building up a national capacity
            to promote, assist and coordinate the diverse natural
            resource management (NRM) initiatives underway in Niger in
            the framework of the National Natural Resources Management
            Program (NNRMP), and help prepare NRM policies and
            strategies, based on lessons learned from field experience.
            The principal components of the project are: 1) direct
            technical and financial assistance to communities for the
            design and implementation of Community-Based Natural
            Resource Management (CBNRM) plans involving about 280
            selected communities in five districts, and assistance
            through ongoing NRM projects to another 100 communities in
            Niger; 2) provision of services to help achieve the
            project's objectives, namely: human resource
            development, national assessment of the state of natural
            resources, natural resource information networking, research
            and studies; and 3) assistance to decision-makers in
            devising national NRM policies and strategies.
