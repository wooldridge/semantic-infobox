            The information industry offers
            significant export opportunities to the countries of the
            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).  Focused
            action could quickly deliver jobs and new export earnings.
            Investor interest is strong.  U.S.- and European-based
            customer service centers, image processing and claims
            fulfillment operations, and transcription and secretarial
            services see the potential to cut labor costs through
            offshore operations.   One possible strategy for the OECS
            countries is to offer office-park-style "free
            zones" that provide liberal business climates and to
            authorize affordably priced teleports that especially
            benefit export-oriented information service providers.  This
            Note reviews the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the
            Eastern Caribbean countries in information services and
            suggests remedial actions to help them expand in this industry.
