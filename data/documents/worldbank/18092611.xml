ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor, it being understood that any plural references in the&#13;
annexes to Donors, Administration Agreements, Contributions and pro rata shares shall be read as&#13;
singular references to the Donor, its Administration Agreement, its Contributions thereunder and&#13;
the remaining uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, respectively.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law.  Nothing in this&#13;
Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank&#13;
under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to&#13;
prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to&#13;
give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of&#13;
Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3   Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the&#13;
exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be&#13;
insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the&#13;
Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
-6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;
the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a one-time deduction from the&#13;
funds in the Trust Fund, an amount equal to and not greater than thirty-five thousand United States&#13;
Dollars (US$35,000) as a set-up fee for the Trust Fund upon receipt of funds in the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   The Bank may additionally deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided&#13;
either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1   The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3   The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit&#13;

cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust&#13;

4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;

scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information&#13;
within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including&#13;
any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review&#13;
or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;

deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to&#13;
Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;

manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;

Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿cancellation, the Bank shall return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional&#13;
terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
