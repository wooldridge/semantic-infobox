&#13;
        Introduction&#13;
 e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1       The Programmatic      Environment    Structural Adjustment     Loan (EnvSAL),    a&#13;
I&amp;$202.02     million  fixed spread loan for the United Mexican States (Mexico),       was&#13;
approved by the Board on August 6, 2002. The EnvSAL was declared effective on&#13;
December 17, 2002. The First Tranche of US$lOl.Ol       million (minus the front end fee of&#13;
1% of the loan amount capitalized) was released on December 19,2002.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The EnvSAL supports the first stage of Mexico's medium-term outcome-based&#13;
program to promote sustainable development. The overarching objective of the program&#13;
is  to   balance    socioeconomic   development     with   environmental    protection and&#13;
improvement.     The program focuses on (i) mainstreaming of environmental concerns in&#13;
key sectoral development agendas, as prioritized by Mexico;         and (ii) improving the&#13;
effectiveness and efficiency of local environmental management processesin Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
3.      This operation has supported Mexico to mainstream environmental concerns in&#13;
water, forestry, energy and tourism sectors through (a) the establishment of high-level&#13;
and technical coordination mechanisms with other sectors, including          the setting of&#13;
medium-term targets to promote mainstreaming of environment in sectoral policy; and&#13;
(b) the design and implementation of fiscal instruments to promote the payment of&#13;
municipal   water fees and investment in municipal hydraulic works and for revenue&#13;
generation from      the use of national    marine protected areas and corresponding&#13;
reinvestment in the environmental management of these areas.With respect to program&#13;
objective (ii), the EnvSAL has supported (a) the creation of an enabling environment to&#13;
decentralize federal environmental management functions to the State level via changes&#13;
to key laws; (b) the preparation and implementation         of a stepwise decentralization&#13;
strategy, which includes the use of third party certification to ensure that the quality of&#13;
decentralized    processes is   maintained;   (c)  the preparation    and publication    of&#13;
decentralization plans on the part of at least 20 states; (d) the assignment of budget and&#13;
targeted use of a federal grant program (PDIA) to finance capacity building in States with&#13;
plan&amp;o assume new environmental management functions; and (e) the development and&#13;
implementation of a strategy to improve public access to information on Environmental&#13;
   pact Assessment (E      ) and permit applications based on the recent passage of a key&#13;
national law on the transparency of information.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Mexico has met all the conditions of the Env AL, with the exception of three&#13;
conditions, which have been met for the most part. Partial waivers are sought for these&#13;
conditions: (i) condition 1: the establishment of Intersectorial Technical Working Groups&#13;
(ITWGs)    in water, energy, tourism, and forestry; (ii) condition 8: ISO-9001-2000&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
certification of certain EIA review and approval, forest fire detection and control and&#13;
permit-issuance functions of the Ministry        of Environment    and Natural Resources&#13;
(SEMARNAT)       that are to be decentralized to the state governments from SEMARNAT;&#13;
and (iii) condition 11: public disclosure of processing information of certain permits. In&#13;
the case of condition     1, the ITWGs have all been established and are functional.&#13;
However, technically, a partial waiver is needed and warranted, since a few of the&#13;
positions described in the EnvSAL have been changed. These changes, in some cases,&#13;
were to ensure more appropriate representation in the ITWG              than was originally&#13;
envisaged during the preparation stage of the loan; in other cases,the agency in question&#13;
underwent reorganization resulting in changes in the title of the post. Nevertheless, in all&#13;
cases, the positions are at the same organizational level as envisaged in the EnvSAL,&#13;
continue to be with the same agencies specified in the EnvSAL, and will perform the&#13;
appropriate substantive functions. In the case of conditions 8 and 11, the majority of the&#13;
functions related to EIA review and approval and permits described in the EnvSAL have&#13;
already been certified and processing information of related permits is disclosed on&#13;
public websites. The exceptions relate to forest fire detection and control (which was&#13;
transferred out of SEMARNAT        to the Forestry Commission (CONAFOR)          ) following&#13;
approval of a new Forestry Law) and non-timber reporting (Permit No. SEMARNAT-03-&#13;
005).   In the case of the latter, this is likely to be delayed since the newly-appointed&#13;
Undersecretary (following recent Cabinet level changes) is conducting a complete review&#13;
of permitting procedures, and there is a likelihood that some permits will be combined.&#13;
Therefore it makes more senseto await completion of this review, prior to embarking on&#13;
certification and setting up a system to disclose these permitting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Based on the assessment that the objectives of the program have been met in&#13;
substance and that all conditions have been met with the exception of three conditions&#13;
requiring minor partial waivers, it is proposed that the Second Tranche of the EnvSAL in&#13;
the amount of US$ 101.Ol million be made available to Mexico for withdrawal from the&#13;
Loan Account.&#13;
&#13;
II 0     Macroeconomic     Framewor&#13;
&#13;
6.       The macroeconomic policy framework of Mexico continues to be satisfactory.&#13;
          continues to implement its monetary and fiscal policies in accordance with its&#13;
         programs and within the framework of the multi-annual program PR&#13;
2002-2006 issued in June 2002 aspart of Mexico's national development plan&#13;
                                    I&#13;
                                                                       I      I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 .      Economic  activity in Mexico     is starting to show signs of recovery after a&#13;
protracted stagnation over the past few years. Output fell by 0.3 percent in 2001 in&#13;
response to the sharp slowdown of the U.S. economy an            has since shown a modest&#13;
rebound. Real GDP increased by 0.9 percent in 2002 and 1.2 percent during the first half&#13;
of 2003. The weak economic growth performance has been attributed to a delayed U.S.&#13;
recovery and a contraction       of private investment      in  view    of global  economic&#13;
uncertainties. Despite a disappointing growth performance, the Mexican economy has&#13;
been able to weather the international economic downturn and emerging market&#13;
turbulence over the past few years maintaining financial and price stability and access to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
capital markets. The twelve-month inflation reached 4.0 percent by September 2003 and&#13;
is most likely    to fall below 4 percent by year-end, thereby attaining the monetary&#13;
authorities' medium-term inflation target of 3 percent plus/minus 1 percent. Domestic&#13;
interest rates came down significantly, reaching historic lows throughout the yield curve&#13;
on average during the third quarter of 2003, thereby creating adequate conditions for a&#13;
domestic demand recovery.       A floating exchange rate regime is being maintained and&#13;
even though there have been some periods of a weakening peso/dollar rate recently, such&#13;
depreciation of the exchange rate is not yet showing up in inflation              or inflation&#13;
expectations.&#13;
&#13;
8        In  terms   of  fiscal  policy,  Mexico    remains    committed   to further    fiscal&#13;
consolidation in order to assure medium-term fiscal sustainability and underpin market&#13;
credibility.  Mexico is largely meeting its increasingly low annual deficit targets, based&#13;
on the traditional definition of the deficit, through the implementation of budget adjustors&#13;
that reduce spending in response to unexpected revenue shortfalls.         The fiscal deficit&#13;
stayed within its target in 2002 at 0.65 percent of GDP (not taking into account an&#13;
extraordinary budget appropriation for the liquidation of Banrural, a highly inefficient&#13;
rural development bank) and is within reach for 2003 at 0.5 percent of GDP largely as a&#13;
result of a high oil windfall this year. The authorities already announced a fiscal deficit&#13;
target of 0.3 percent of GDP for next year's budget. As a result of increasing credibility&#13;
in the authorities' monetary and fiscal policy stance, the Mexican government has been&#13;
able to refinance and redeem the remainder of its outstanding Brady bonds as well as to&#13;
increase the average maturity and lengthen the yield curve of domestic public debt.&#13;
&#13;
III e    Second Tranche Conditions of the Em&amp;AL&#13;
&#13;
9        Achievements    under the second tranche of the EnvSAL             reflect important&#13;
advances in inter-institutional coordination, with the aim of facilitating mainstreaming of&#13;
environmental concerns in the sectoral development agenda. Terms of references for&#13;
future sectoral activities prepared by the ITWGs reflect the input from different sectors,&#13;
and has resulted in higher quality products.       The successful implementation of fiscal&#13;
instruments for both municipal water fees and protected areas,where funds are channeled&#13;
back to the sector to improve environmental management is also noteworthy.             On the&#13;
activities related to decentralization, an important advance has been the certification of&#13;
several processesunder the                        anagement Sub- ecretariat of the      inistry&#13;
of Environment.     There have been several recent Cabinet level changes in the Tourism,&#13;
Energy and Environment Ministries.       This has resulted in changes in Ministries'   staffing&#13;
and in reviews of existing programs. Nevertheless, this Program is considered to be a&#13;
key program by the Mexican authorities for mainstreaming environment in sectoral&#13;
policy, and             as formally requested the    ank to initiate preparation of the second&#13;
loan envisaged under the Program.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
         his condition   has been partially     met and requires a waiver.       Technical&#13;
groups were established during project preparation and continue to the current day. The&#13;
persons whose posts are named in the loan agreement, as noted above, have met for each&#13;
of the four working groups. The exception in the case of the Water      roup,  has been the&#13;
replacement of SCT's Director      General Adjunto de la Unidad de Infraestructura y&#13;
Carreteras para el Desarrollo      Regional with SCT's Director      General Adjunto      de&#13;
Planeacion.  The other exception has been in the case of the Tourism Group, in which&#13;
FONATUR's      Director Adjunto de Planeacidn y Foment0 a la Inversion has been&#13;
replaced by FONATUR's       Director Adjunto de Planeacion y Asistencia Tecnica, SE's&#13;
  irector     romocion        royectos has been replaced with SE's       irector de Enlace&#13;

Carreteras para el Desarrollo Regional has been replaced with SCT's Coordinadora&#13;
General de Planeacion y Centros.      These changes, in some cases, were to ensure more&#13;
appropriate representation in the ITWG        than was originally   envisaged during the&#13;
preparation stage of the loan; in other cases, the agency in question underwent&#13;
reorganization resulting in changes in the title of the post. Nevertheless in all cases, the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
positions are at the same organizational level as envisaged in the EnvSAL, continue to be&#13;
with the same agencies specified in the EnvSAL,          and will perform the appropriate&#13;
substantive functions. A waiver is therefore sought, as this change does not affect in any&#13;
material way the objective of this condition to set up inter-institutional     coordination&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
12      The second second tranche condition is as follows:&#13;
    l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        "`Each ITWG has: (a) prepared written internal procedures for its functioning,&#13;
        which     shall include    (i) coordination    mechanisms     and  (ii)  monitoring&#13;
        arrangements to evaluate progress of its work (as relate to the actions covered by&#13;
        this Schedule and by its work program; and (b) defined the scope of its work&#13;
        program and prepared written terms of reference for addressing the tasks set&#13;
       forth in the letter dated June 26, 2002from SEMARNAT to the Bank. "&#13;
&#13;
13      This condition    has been met.       Each of the ITWGs have prepared written&#13;
internal procedures for its functioning, which include (i) coordination mechanisms and&#13;
(ii) monitoring   arrangements to evaluate progress of its work, in addition to TORs&#13;
pertaining to tasks detailed in the letter dated June 26, 2002 from SEMARNAT          to the&#13;
Bank. These TOWShave been formally reviewed, commented upon, and endorsed by the&#13;
ITWG members.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The third second tranche condition is asfollows:&#13;
&#13;
        "Municipalities  (with more than 2500 inhabitants each and including the Distrito&#13;
        Federal), accounting for 55% of water use by volume in Mexico starting January&#13;
        1, 2002 and ending on a specific date no earlier than October 1, 2002, have for&#13;
        said period paid (or had paid on their behalf) all their water usefees due under&#13;
        Title II, Chapter VIII of the 2002 version of the Ley Federal de Derechos (Federal&#13;
        Rights Law) published in the Borrower's         Diario   Oficial de la Federation&#13;
        (OfSicial Gazette) on January 1, 2002. "&#13;
&#13;
15      This condition has been met.      On October 1,2003, municipalities had paid, in&#13;
the period specified above, for 58% of water use by volume in      exico, exceeding the&#13;
percentage specified in the&#13;
&#13;
160     The fourth second tranche condition is asfollows:&#13;
&#13;
        "At least 95% of the fees referred to in paragraph 3 above (and paid by or on&#13;
        behalf of municipalities for which an agreement (convenio) has been entered into&#13;
        pursuant to Article Second of the Presidential    ecreepublished on page I6 of the&#13;
        First   Section (Primera     Section) of  the Borrower's     Diario   Oficial de la&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
17      This condition    has been met.      Evidence received from the National Water&#13;
Commission of Mexico documents that this target has been met for each of the first three&#13;
trimesters of 2002.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The fifth secondtranche condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        "Information detailing amounts (at an aggregate national level) of paid water use&#13;
       fees transferred to municipalities by CNA pursuant to Article 231-A of said Ley&#13;
        Federal de Derechos is publicly available within iMexico. "&#13;
&#13;
19      This condition    has been met.     Information is available to the public on the&#13;
website of Mexico's National Water Commission (Comision National de Agua).&#13;
&#13;
20.     The sixth second tranche condition is asfollows:&#13;
&#13;
        "Total fees collected pursuant to Article 198 of said Ley Federal de Derechos&#13;
        (starting January 1, 2002 and ending two months prior to the Second Tranche&#13;
        Release Date), and available for usefor protected marine natural areas pursuant&#13;
        to the last paragraph of said Article (during said sameperiod), are at least twenty&#13;
        times greater than suchfees so collected for the sameperiod of the year 2001. "&#13;
&#13;
21.     This condition    has been met.      During the period specified above, the fees&#13;
collected pursuant Article 198 and available for use for protected marine natural areas&#13;
were more than twenty times greater than in 2001. Information          received from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance indicates an over 60-fold increase in the resources available for use&#13;
for protected marine natural areas from user fees compared with 2001 by end October&#13;
2002. As this program continues to be implemented, the 60-fold increase has since been&#13;
greatly exceeded.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The seventh second tranche condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        "Information detailing amounts of fees collected pursuant to Articles 198, 198-A&#13;
        and 238-B of said Ley Federal de Derechos is publicly available within Mexico. "&#13;
&#13;
23.       his condition                     Information is available to the public on the&#13;
website of Mexico's      National Commission     for Natural Protected Areas (Comision&#13;
National de Areas Naturales Protegidas).&#13;
&#13;
24.     The eighth second tranche condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        "The environmental impact assessment (manifestation de impact0 ambiental)&#13;
        review and approval functions of SEMARNAT's Subsecretarta de Gestion para la&#13;
        Protection Ambiental, its forest fire detection and control function, as well as its&#13;
       permit issuancefunctions pursuant to Article 11 of the Borrowe             General&#13;
        de1Equilibrio Ecologic0 y la Proteccidn al Ambiente (LGEEPA;              1Law on&#13;
        Ecological   Equilibrium  and Environmental       Protection), Article  11 of   the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Borrower's Ley General de Vida Silvestre (General Law on Wildlife), Article 7 of&#13;
        the Borrower's Ley Forestal (Forestry Law) and Article 50 Bis of the Borrower's&#13;
        Ley de Bienes Nacionales (National Assets Law), have been certified by an&#13;
         independent certification      body as being in conformity           with International&#13;
         Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality management standard 9001:2000.&#13;
        For purposes of this paragraph, the permit issuancefunctions referred to above&#13;
        are thosefunctions (tramites) referred to within SEMARNAT as INE-05-002, INE-&#13;
        06-002,    INE-04-002,     INE-04-003,       INE-02-004,     INE-02-005,    INE-02-009,&#13;
        SEMARNAT-03-00.5, SEMARNAT-02-001 and SEMARNAT-01-002-A. "&#13;
&#13;
25      This condition has been partially      met and requires a waiver.       Certification in&#13;
I&amp;   9001:2000 has been obtained for most of the functions specified above, as evidenced&#13;
by formal documentation of certification received in December 2002. Exceptions are the&#13;
functions related to forest fire detection and control, since these functions was transferred&#13;
from SEMARNAT's        Subsecretarl'a de Gestion para la Protection Ambiental to the&#13;
National Forestry Commission , following approval by Congress in December 2002 of&#13;
the new Forestry Law. In addition, the function to process non-timber reports (Permit&#13;
No. SEMARNAT-03-005)          has still to be certified. This is likely to be delayed following&#13;
a complete review of all permitting procedures by the new Undersecretary, who was&#13;
appointed in September 2003, following Cabinet-level changesby President Fox which&#13;
have resulted in changesto SEMARNAT's            Secretary and Undersecretaries. There is a&#13;
strong likelihood that some permits may be combined as a result of the review. Therefore&#13;
it makes more senseto await completion of this review, prior to embarking on&#13;
certification and setting up a system to further disclose these permitting procedures. Since&#13;
certification of these functions do not affect the objectives of the project, following&#13;
receipt of a request by Mexico, a partial waiver is sought for pending actions related to&#13;
this condition.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The ninth secondtranche condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         "All  of  the decentralization      plans, for    the assumption of      environmental&#13;
        management functions assigned to the Borrower's Estados (States) pursuant to&#13;
        said Ley General de1Equilibrio Ecologic0 y la Protection al Ambiente, prepared&#13;
        by such                                                  are published and thus made&#13;
        publicly&#13;
&#13;
                                           et.      formation  is available to the public on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2 .                                       ition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         "At least ten of the Borrower's         Estados (States) are receiving funding for&#13;
         capacity building under SEMARNAT's Programa de Desarrollo                  Institutional&#13;
                        IA, Environmental Institutional Development&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 9     This condition    has been met,    Evidence provided indicated that in 2002, 22&#13;
staies were authorized to receive funds under SEMARNAT's       PDIA. By the end of 2002,&#13;
97% of the authorized amount had been distributed, in accordance with the rules of the&#13;
PDIA.&#13;
&#13;
30.    The eleventh second tranche condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        "SEMARNAT is publicly disclosing information (on its website, for example), on&#13;
       the processing status of each requestfor its review and approval of environmental&#13;
       impact assessmentsand of each request for      the issuance of a permit of the type&#13;
       listed in paragraph 8 above."&#13;
&#13;
31     This condition has been partially met and requires a waiver. This has been&#13;
completed on a pilot basis for permits INE-05-002, INE-06-002, INE-04-002, INE-04-&#13;
003, INE-02-004, INE-02-005, INE-02-009 and information on theseis available on&#13;
SEMARNAT's       website. A partial waiver is sought in the caseof permits SEMARNAT-&#13;
03-005, SEM.ARNAT-02-00 l$ SEMARNAT-0 1-002-A for the same reasons as detailed&#13;
in paragraph 25.&#13;

            Mexico - Programmatic Environment
            Structural Adjustment Loan Project : Release of second
            tranche and partial waiver of three conditions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Programmatic Environment Structural
            Adjustment Loan Project, supports the first stage of
            Mexico's medium-term outcome-based program to promote
            sustainable development, and to mainstream environmental
            concerns in water, forestry, energy and tourism sectors.
            Mexico has met all the conditions of this operation, with
            the exception of three conditions, which have been met for
            the most part. Partial waivers are sought for these
            conditions: a) condition 1: the establishment of
            Inter-sectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) in water,
            energy, tourism, and forestry; b) condition 8: ISO-9001-2000
            certification of certain environmental impact assessment
            (EIA) review and approval, forest fire detection and
            control, and permit-issuance functions of the Ministry of
            Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) that are to be
            decentralized to the state governments from SEMARNAT; and,
            c) condition 11: public disclosure of processing information
            of certain permits. Condition 1: the ITWGs have all been
            established and are functional. However, technically, a
            partial waiver is needed and warranted, given changes, in
            some cases, to ensure more appropriate representation in the
            ITWG than was originally envisaged during project
            preparation were needed, and also, because the agency in
            question underwent reorganization changes. Conditions 8 and
            11: the majority of functions related to EIA review,
            approval and permits, have been certified, and processing
            information of related permits is disclosed on public
            websites. The exceptions relate to forest fire detection and
            control (which was transferred out of SEMARNAT to the
            Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) following approval of a new
            Forestry Law) and, non-timber reporting (Permit No.
            SEMARNAT-03-005). The latter is likely to be delayed, since
            a complete review of permitting procedures is being
            conducted, and seemingly, some permits will be combined.
            Therefore it makes more sense to await completion of this
            review, prior to embarking on certification, and/or
            disclosure of permitting procedures. Based on the assessment
            that the objectives of the program have been met in
            substance, and that all conditions have been met with the
            exception of three conditions requiring minor partial
            waivers, it is proposed that the Second Tranche be made available.
