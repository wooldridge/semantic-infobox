Reforming Insolvency Systems 2 1 32&#13;
in Latin America&#13;
MWalcolm Rowat    Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru have recently revised their insolvency laws. The&#13;
Argentine reforms are of special note because they have been complemented by labor law reforms.&#13;
But reforms are still on the drawing board in many other countries in Latin America-including the&#13;
big economies of Brazil and Mexico-where the laws tend to be very old, formalistic, not enforced,&#13;
out of touch with today's business practices, and heavily skewed to favor preserving the enterprise&#13;
to protect employment at the expense of creditor protection. Moreover, judicial decisionmaking is&#13;
unpredictable, and corruption is rampant. In some countries anticreditor political pressures appear&#13;
to have stalled the reform process. This Note assesses the weaknesses of insolvency law in Latin&#13;
America and proposes some common solutions.&#13;

            The note shares conflicting interests
            hampering insolvency systems reform in Latin America, and
            aims at assessing legal weaknesses, to propose some common
            solutions. Most insolvency systems share two prime
            objectives: allocating risk among participants in the
            economy, in a predictable, equitable and transparent way,
            and, maximizing the value of the insolvent firm for the
            benefit of all interested parties, and the broader economy.
            However, current regional problems reflect too rigid and
            formal insolvency laws; very high degrees of judicial
            discretion, increasing uncertainty, and financial risks;
            rampant corruption; absence of enforcement mechanisms to
            protect creditor interests; and, a powerful, explicit bias
            in favor of labor claimants, who are highly protected under
            preferential treatment. The note proposes a common set of
            essential reforms, to be prioritized according to each
            county's circumstances. First, disclosure of
            behind-the-scene dealings should be required, incentives
            created to combat corruption, rules of conduct setup, and,
            insolvency professional associations fostered. Second,
            insolvency laws should clearly differentiate criminal, from
            bankruptcy issues, where criminal conduct should not
            preclude insolvency relief to a business in crisis. Third,
            bankruptcy proceedings demand rapid resolution, by
            specialized courts, under regional cooperation in
            cross-border insolvency cases.
