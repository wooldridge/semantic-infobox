&#13;
                                          I. Background&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The DRC continues its recovery from 25 years o f mismanagement and collapse o f the&#13;
 State under the regime o f Mobutu Sese Seko, culminating in a dreadful decade o f political&#13;
 instability and conflict involving groups from the entire Great Lakes region during the 1990s.&#13;
 Since January 2001, the Congolese authorities have taken a number o f important steps to&#13;
implement the peace agreements, to liberalize political life and to address key economic issues.&#13;
A coalition government o f transition is functioning and the country is preparing for elections. A&#13;
UNpeacekeepingforce, the Mission d'Obsewation desNations Unies au Congo (MONUC) has&#13;
been deployed throughout the country and is helping stabilize even the most conflict affected&#13;
areas o f the country. Just as the instability, conflict, and ungovernability o f the D R C had regional&#13;
implications, the stabilization o f the D R C i s critical to sustained peace inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
2.      On the economic front, the Government's reforms have included fiscal stabilization (now&#13;
in its fifth year); liberalization of prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange; reform of the&#13;
Central Bank, liquidatiodrestructuring o f non-performing/weak banks coupled with banking and&#13;
co-operative banking acts; steps to adopt and apply the new codes for mining and forestry, and&#13;
continued implementation o f a broad set o f good governance and anti-corruption policies. A&#13;
program o f public enterprise reforms is underway, together with tax and regulatory reforms&#13;
designed to facilitate private sector growth and job-creation. The Government continues to&#13;
negotiate with its internal and external creditors to lighten the remaining debt burden.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Credit provides overall support to the Government's economic program (programme&#13;
kconomique du gouvernement, or PEG) for sustainable growth and poverty reduction, described&#13;
inthe Letter ofDevelopment Policy, dated January 21,2004, as well as inthree specific areas: (i)&#13;
settlement o f internal debt to public utilities with services important to the poor; (ii) settlement o f&#13;
internal debt to private commercial creditors; and (iii)effective retirement program for civil&#13;
servants who have already attained the official retirement age.          Proceeds o f the Credit provide&#13;
funds necessary to support DRC's reform efforts and finance the economy's continued&#13;
stabilization, rehabilitation and reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                   11.     RECENT POLITICALAND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
4.      Progress continues in the process of peace, reunification and political reconciliation.&#13;
The Congolese continue the important steps they began to take in 2001 to implement the 1999&#13;
Lusaka Peace Accord and agreements reached through the inter-Congolese dialogue, to liberalize&#13;
political life and to address key economic issues. On October 1, 2004 (resolution 1565) the&#13;
Security Council expanded the mandate o f United Nations Organization Mission in the Congo&#13;
(MONUC) and authorized an increase in its troop from 10,800 to 16,700. Its forces have been&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 redeployed from their former observation posts throughout the country where peace has been&#13;
 established firmly to the remaining areas o f localized violence in the northeast, and it is&#13;
 beginningto stabilize even these regions. The effectiveness o f the reunification was marked in&#13;
 October 2004 by a visit by President Kabila to formerly-rebel held Kisangani. However, the brief&#13;
 seizures in late M a y 2004 o f the eastem city o f Bukavu by ethnic militants, and in October 2004&#13;
 o f a town inKatanga by an unknown armed group, demonstrate that the process i s still fragile.&#13;
&#13;
 5,      At the same time, the Demobilization, Repatriation, Resettlement and Reintegration&#13;
program, supported by the UN and IDA, has become operational and is beginning to help ex-&#13;
 combatants, including child soldiers, to reintegrate themselves into society. The program i s&#13;
 supported by the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) for the&#13;
 Great Lakes Region: the program for D R C was consideredby the Executive Directors o f IDA on&#13;
M a y 25,2004, and financed by grants from several countries and international organizations. The&#13;
 command structure o f the combined armed forces has been reunified and regional military&#13;
commanders have been appointed and taken their posts throughout the country, though a small&#13;
number o f soldiers o f former rebel groups have refused tojoin. The EuropeanUnionlaunched in         .&#13;
 September 2004 a program to train a national police force, with members also drawn from all o f&#13;
the former armed groups, andplans to expand this program to five centers nationwide. The long-&#13;
term aim i s to train 9,000 police officers to lead a police force to maintain peace throughout the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
6.       On the domestic front, the inclusive Government o f national unity, which took power on&#13;
June 30, 2003, with representation from all key armed groups, unarmed opposition, and civil&#13;
society, continues to function cooperatively, despite some resistance from a few opposition&#13;
leaders. Elections are scheduled to start inlate 2005, a calendar which the Special Representative&#13;
o f the Secretary General calls tight but tenable. On October 8, 2004, the Government issued a&#13;
"roadmap" defining, in a consensual manner, the actions and their timing to be undertaken by&#13;
each o f the institutions o f the Republic during the remaining months o f the transition. The&#13;
Parliament recently adopted the draft Constitution, which will be put to popular referendum. It&#13;
must also pass about 15 essential laws before the elections.&#13;
&#13;
7.       These developments point to the continued commitment o f all key stakeholders to peace&#13;
andthe maintenance o f a viable process o f electoral transition, as well as the protection o fhuman&#13;
rights. They indicate a window o f opportunity `for peace and recovery in the DRC and an&#13;
opportunity for peace inthe entire sub-region. This opportunity calls for continued donor support&#13;
as the country prepares for national elections while a unified national administration is being re-&#13;
established, including inthe formerly rebel-.occupied territories.&#13;
&#13;
                           111.     RECENT  ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
8.       The Government's heavily front-loaded economic reform program, monitored by staff o f&#13;
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), succeeded in breaking hyperinflation, liberalizing the&#13;
economy, and initiating major structural reforms. The program was supported by a Poverty&#13;
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive Directors o f the IMF on June&#13;
12, 2002. The PGRF has been implemented satisfactorily, with the fourth review presented to&#13;
the Fund's Board on July 12, 2004. Macroeconomic performance weakened towards the end o f&#13;
2004, when money-financed emergency spending for security purposes caused rapid depreciation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 o f the currency, and inflation rose correspondingly. However, the strict measures undertaken by&#13;
 the Government to counter the slippage in early 2005 have stabilized the currency and domestic&#13;
 prices. Inrecognition that the macroeconomic stability has been restored, the IMF staff recently&#13;
 concluded the fifth review o f the PRGF program scheduled to be discussed at its Board on&#13;
 August 29,2005.&#13;
&#13;
 9.       Overall performance under the Government's economic program (programme&#13;
 e`conomique du gouvernement or PEG), as described in the Letter o f Development Policy&#13;
 (January 21,2004), continued to be satisfactory through end 2004, with the exception o f inflation&#13;
 mentioned above. The economy grew at 6 % in2003 and 7 % in2004, reversing years o f decline&#13;
 until2001. Hyperinflation was broken, and inflationwas at less than 5 % in2003 and untilthe&#13;
 third quarter o f 2004. The emergency spending mentioned inthe previous paragraph caused the&#13;
 exchange rate to depreciate, and the prices to increase by 17% between December 04 and M a y&#13;
 05, or at an annualized rate o f roughly 60%.                     The Government took corrective measures&#13;
 including raising the Central Bank's prime rate from 25% to 60%, and rejecting systematically&#13;
 any fiscal expenditure above the authorized (budgeted) amount. As a result, the exchange rate&#13;
 stabilized and inflation started to decline after peaking in mid April. These indicators will&#13;
 continue to be monitored closely, as special programs such as elections and demobilization&#13;
program are expected to add extra pressure on the already constrained State budget in2005.&#13;
&#13;
 10.      Fiscal performance in 2004 was satisfactory, with the deficit at end 2004 estimated at&#13;
3.8% o f GDP, rather than 4.9% as programmed (preliminary figures). On the revenue side, the&#13;
fiscal revenues (before grant) are estimated to be 9.1% o f GDP, outperforming the target by&#13;
approximately 3%, due to higher than expected petroleum revenues. This result confirms the&#13;
increasing trend o f fiscal revenues: they were only 5.1 percent o f GDP in2000, and are expected&#13;
to reach 11.5% in 2008. The expenditure side was less satisfactory as the end-2004 target for&#13;
current expenditures appears to have been exceeded by23%, or roughly US$14 million, although&#13;
less than expected foreign-financed capital expenditures and low execution o f HIPC priority&#13;
expenditures made total expenditures lower than projected.' Pro-poor spending, at 2% o f GDP,&#13;
missed the target o f 6.6% by a significant margin, although it still represented an improvement&#13;
over the 2003 result o f 1.5%. This underperformance is attributed to lack o f capacity to plan and&#13;
spend expeditiously the anti-poverty fund created under the terms o f the enhanced HIPC&#13;
Initiative.    The Government is taking measures to overcome these problems, particularly in&#13;
health and education sectors.&#13;
&#13;
11,       On the external side, the performance o f the balance o f payments and gross foreign&#13;
reserves in 2004 was broadly satisfactory. Strong export growth and significant extemal grants&#13;
since 2001 have maintained the current account deficit at sustainable levels, despite a sharp rise&#13;
o f imports to support the recovering economy. The Central Bank's gross foreign reserves have&#13;
improved from 2.6 weeks o f non-aid related imports o f goods and non factor services in 2003 to&#13;
5.4 weeks in 2004.             The foreign exchange market has functioned satisfactorily since the&#13;
liberalization o f foreign exchange regulations inFebruary 2001 and the unification o f the foreign&#13;
exchange market in M a y 2001. The nominal exchange rate has been relatively stable vis-&amp;vis&#13;
the U.S. dollar until the third quarter o f 2004 at roughly CGF420/dollarYbut depreciated sharply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The current expenditure overrun inpartreflectsthe securityexpendituresmentionedabove.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 towards end 2004 to above CGF500/dollar because o f the above-mentioned emergency spending&#13;
 in a heavily dollarized economy. With the corrective measures, the exchange rate stabilized at&#13;
 around CGF51Sldollar since mid-April (and has actually appreciated somewhat), although the&#13;
 market remains volatile inthe pre-electoral context.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Other aspects o f the program (PEG) are being implemented in a broadly satisfactory&#13;
manner, albeit more slowly than forecast insome areas (see the Annex for details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Iv.     PROGRESSUNDERTHE PmRCFINANCEDPROGRAM&#13;
A.       Overview&#13;
 13.     The Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit (PRERC) supports the Government's&#13;
economic reform program (PEG) in three critical areas: (i)setting up an efficient system o f&#13;
centralized payment o f public utilities; (ii)civil service management reform, and inparticular the&#13;
departure o f staff having reached retirement age; and (iii)completing the process o f debt&#13;
reduction and restructuring begununder the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), in terms o f both&#13;
settling domestic commercial arrears and preventingthe accumulation o f new arrears.&#13;
&#13;
 14.     The centralized payment tranche of the PRERC was disbursed in November 2004&#13;
upon adoption by the Government o f an action plan to control its utility use and expenditures,&#13;
and adoptionbyREGIDESO (water company) and SNEL (electricity company) o f action plans to&#13;
improve the reliability, transparency, and accountability o f their billingprocedures. As envisaged&#13;
in the action plans, the Government and the two companies are working to finalize the list of&#13;
entities entitled to State-financed water and electricity services. The two companies have begun&#13;
to install meters so that the billing can be based on actual consumption in the future&#13;
(consumption-based billing to begin by end-2005).         The Government and the companies will&#13;
agree on a protocol o f billing procedures to ensure timely payments o f the utility bills. The&#13;
payments o f the water and electricity bills (for January 2005) were effected in mid-May. The&#13;
delay notwithstanding, this payment shows that the Government has reached an important&#13;
milestone inits reform efforts to make timely and regular payments o f utility bills. The remaining&#13;
kinks in the payment system are expected to be ironed out over the next six months with the&#13;
implementation o f the three action plans.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Retirement program for civil servantspast their legal retirement age&#13;
&#13;
15.      The reform o f public institutions, including the civil service, constitutes one o f the four&#13;
pillars o f the Government's strategy and action plan for restoring public service delivery and&#13;
combating corruption in the DRC. To this end, a strategy for "civil service reform and for&#13;
institutional capacity reinforcement" was drafted in2003 with the technical assistance o f a multi-&#13;
donor program. The reform program includes the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)      defining a strategic framework which begins at the center andprovincialbranches o f&#13;
             central ministries before moving to provincialgovernments;&#13;
    (ii)     performing operational analyses o f key ministries to lead to their reorganization;&#13;
    (iii)    reviewing service delivery mechanisms, especially at the local level, covering health,&#13;
             education, andjustice;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (iv)   establishing a modempersonnel management andpayroll system based on a&#13;
             comprehensive census o f civil servants and an audit o f the payrollmanagement&#13;
             system; and&#13;
      (v)    implementing a retirement program for those staff (about 100,000) havingreached&#13;
            the legal age for retirement by end-2004.&#13;
 16.      Implementation o f this reform program started in2003. The operational analyses o f some&#13;
 o f the key ministries are completed, and others are underway. A survey to review the service&#13;
 delivery mechanism in health, education, justice, and local government's administration was&#13;
 carried out with the help o f the World Bank (preliminary report was delivered in June 2005).&#13;
 Civil service census for Kinshasa is being conducted with the help o f South Africa and other&#13;
 donors, preliminary results o f which are expected to become available in mid-2005.           The&#13;
preparations for the census in provinces will start in the second half o f 2005. Improving the&#13;
payroll system is underway with the assistance o f France, and a new transitory simplifiedpayroll&#13;
 system is expected to be operational starting October 2005, while discussions are ongoing for&#13;
introducing a permanent full-fledged human resources management system.&#13;
&#13;
 17.      The PRERC supports the civil service management reform through technical&#13;
assistance to the Government for formulating the strategy for the civil servants who reached the&#13;
retirement age to depart from service, and financial assistance for paying the retirement package.&#13;
The aim i s to improve the management o f civil servants, which in tum should contribute in the&#13;
longer run to better public service delivery. A modicum o f social protection will be afforded to&#13;
the retired civil servants, which should strengthen social peace.&#13;
&#13;
C. Settlement of Internal Commercial Debt&#13;
&#13;
18.      The Government has made much progress on tackling public debt. First, on the external&#13;
side, Paris Club rescheduling in 2002 and progress under the enhanced HIPC Initiative have&#13;
greatly reduced the external debt service burden o f the DRC. Second, London Club deliberations&#13;
began inFebruary 2003 to address the US$833 million balance in external commercial debts. In&#13;
addition, in order to improve private investor confidence, the Government also resolved to tackle&#13;
the issue o f internal debt. To this end, the Government created an inter-ministerial steering&#13;
commission for public internal debt (Commission de la Dette Publique Interieure or CDPI),&#13;
tasked to oversee the inventory, negotiations, and settlement process o f this debt.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The PRERC supports the internal commercial debt settlement through technical&#13;
assistance to CDPI, in particular, in defining the terms o f reference for and selecting (i)&#13;
independent auditor to determine the stock o f debt, (ii)  independent negotiator to facilitate the&#13;
negotiations between the creditors and the Government, and (iii)commercial bank to effect&#13;
payments to entitled creditors. The aim is to further the Government's efforts to restore its&#13;
credibility vis-a-vis the private sector, and to create an environment inwhich the private sector&#13;
activities can thrive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                              v.      CONDITIONS FORRELEASEOF TRANCHES&#13;
A. General conditions&#13;
20.     The Development Credit Agreement states that two general conditions must be met at the&#13;
moment o f the PRERC floating tranche releases: (i)     the Association i s satisfied with the progress&#13;
achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out o f its economic program (PEG), and (ii)the&#13;
macroeconomic policy framework o f the Borrower i s satisfactory, as measured on the basis o f&#13;
indicators agreed upon between the Borrower and the Association. These two conditions are met&#13;
as discussed in preceding sections.      Besides these, the credit agreement also specifies the&#13;
following specific conditions for release o f the civil service retirement and internal debt tranches:&#13;
&#13;
B. Specific ConditionsPertaining to CivilService Retirement Tranche&#13;
&#13;
21.     Specific conditions pertaining to the civil service retirement floating tranche o f the&#13;
PRERC reads as follows:&#13;
&#13;
"[tlhe Borrower has furnished to the Association evidence that he has adopted, in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to the Association, a strategy and implementation action plan, in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to the Association setting forth, pursuant to paragraphs 47, 48, and 49 o f&#13;
the Letter o f Development Policy, inter alia:&#13;
&#13;
    (1) the sequencing o f actions required pursuant to the laws o f the Borrower to carry out the&#13;
        transition o f civil servants from active duty into retirement after having fulfilled&#13;
       mandatory retirement criteria;&#13;
&#13;
    (2) (a) determination by amount and other modalities, as applicable, o f the retirement&#13;
       payment due to civil servants eligible to receive said payments pursuant to the laws o f the&#13;
       Borrower; and (b) a cut-off date for eligibility to the entitlement o f retirement payment&#13;
       financed under the Borrower's program supported through this Retirement Tranche; and&#13;
&#13;
    (3) (a) a transparent mechanism for: (i)the identification o f beneficiaries o f retirement&#13;
       payments referred to inparagraph 2 o f this Part B o f Schedule 2 to the Agreement; (ii)     the&#13;
       disbursement o f retirement payments to said beneficiaries; and (iii)      the control o f funds&#13;
       disbursed to said beneficiaries; and (b) (i)       the guaranteed access o f the public to&#13;
       information pertaining to: (A) the list o f beneficiaries as referred to inparagraph 2 o f this&#13;
       Part B o f Schedule 2 to the Agreement; (B) the calendar o f payments to said&#13;
       beneficiaries; and (C) calculation method used to identify the retirement payments due to&#13;
       said beneficiaries, and (ii)the publication o f regulations and administrative acts&#13;
       pertaining to all matters set forth inparagraphs 2 and 3 o f this PartB o f Schedule 2 to the&#13;
       Agreement in the Borrower's Official Gazette and the press and other media o f wide&#13;
       circulation inthe Borrower's territory."&#13;
&#13;
22.    The Borrower has met all o fthese conditions: the Borrower submitted to IDA a document&#13;
adopted by the Council o f Ministers which describes the strategy for identifying the eligible civil&#13;
servants and paying them the indemnities (retirement package). The sequencing o f actions with a&#13;
calendar and responsible parties is clearly laid out in this document. The calculation method to&#13;
determine the amount o f indemnities for each person is spelled out inthe strategy, and the salary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 scales by occupation and grade level are indicated inthe annex to the strategy. The cut-off date&#13;
 i s unequivocally stated as those who already left the service before 2003 for the first group o f&#13;
 retirees, and those who achieve the retirement age by December 31,2004 for the second group.&#13;
 The first group o f retirees will be identified using the documents issued at the time o f&#13;
 recruitment, which will be cross-checked with payroll and civil servant rosters. The second&#13;
 group o f retirees will be identified by the identification card issued during the civil service&#13;
 census. Adequate provisions are made for problem cases, such as the death o f the beneficiary,&#13;
 and loss o f recruitment documents due to the war or any other reasons. The retirement package&#13;
 will be paid out using a non-endorsable check issued by the Central Bank, payable at Central&#13;
 Bank branches and its affiliates. Provisions for auditing the operation are made. All the relevant&#13;
 information will be published inthe officialjournal, and will also be publicized using radio, local&#13;
 newspapers, and announcements.&#13;
&#13;
 C. Specific Conditions Pertaining to Internal Debt Tranche&#13;
&#13;
 23.      Specific conditions pertaining to the intemal debt floating tranche o f the PRERC reads as&#13;
 follows:&#13;
&#13;
"the Borrowerhas furnished to the Association evidence inform and substance satisfactory to the&#13;
Association pursuant to paragraphs 67 and 73 o f the Letter o f Development Policy, inter alia&#13;
that:&#13;
&#13;
     (1) the Stock o f Debt has been validated by the Borrower pursuant to procedures satisfactory&#13;
         to the Association;&#13;
&#13;
     (2) a cut-off date after which domestic creditors are precluded from: (a) submitting claims to&#13;
         be included in the Stock o f Debt; or (b) completing or modifying already submitted&#13;
         claims to be included inthe Stock o f Debt, has been published inthe Borrower's Official&#13;
         Gazette and the press and media o f wide circulation inthe Borrower's territory;&#13;
&#13;
     (3) an agreement, has been concluded between the Borrower and its creditors representing at&#13;
         least 75 percent o f the Stock o f Debt, pertaining to a common discount factor, or discount&#13;
         factors, as the case may be, satisfactory to the Association, applicable to the entire Stock&#13;
         o f Debt; and&#13;
&#13;
     (4) a commercial bank, acceptable to the Association, has been appointed by the Borrower,&#13;
        following a transparent competitive selection process satisfactory to the Association, to&#13;
        effect payment to entitled creditors pursuant to the agreement set forth in paragraph 3 o f&#13;
        this Part Cysubject to aprocedure satisfactory to the Association."&#13;
&#13;
24.     The Borrower has met all o f these conditions. Independent audits o f internal debt to&#13;
private sector were conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, whose service was engaged through a&#13;
competitive bidding process. The total stock o f commercial debt as o f December 31, 2001 was&#13;
determined to be US$472,135,808.        The exhaustive list o f creditors and debts was published in&#13;
the Borrower's Official Gazette, in the press and media o f wide circulation on June 28, 2004.&#13;
The Government reached an agreement on the terms o f payment and discount rates o fthe internal&#13;
debt arrears with private domestic creditors representing approximately 77% o f the stock o f debt&#13;
&#13;

 (see Table 1) at an average discount factor o f 75% in NPV terms. The resulting settlement&#13;
 specifies payment o f the internal debt arrears over a period o f three years starting in 2005 (see&#13;
 Table 2). Subsequently, all internal debt paid will be extinguished. The Borrower confirmed&#13;
 explicitly his intention to apply the same discount factors to the remaining creditors representing&#13;
 the balance o f 23% o f the stock o f debt. Finally, payments will be made through Banque&#13;
 Commerciale du Congo (BCDC), a Congolese Bank, selected though a competitive bidding&#13;
 process.&#13;

25.     The process leading to the negotiation and agreements on internal debt arrears is&#13;
satisfactory and consistent with similar processes in and outside o f Africa.        The CDPI was&#13;
established as an inter-ministerial committee where all factions of the transition Government are&#13;
represented. Several members o f the CDPI, at the ministerial level, are creditors, which i s not an&#13;
uncommon situation ina post conflict country. However, the CDPI was not directly involved in&#13;
the negotiation process, which was fully delegated to an independent negotiator selected through&#13;
a competitive process, Sterling Merchant Bank. It is to be noted that while the CDPI provided&#13;
Sterling Merchant Bank with several indications as to what the outcome o f the negotiation should&#13;
be, the negotiation process remained independent. The outcome o f the negotiations, which was&#13;
also made public, did not lead to any protest from the private sector or thirdparties.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The discount factors negotiated are also consistent with risk premia factored inby private&#13;
sector operators in post conflict countries like DRC, while also leading to steep debt reductions&#13;
to the detriment o f the same private sector operators. These discount factors (average o f 75% in&#13;
NPV terms) are consistent with other similar operations inAfrican countries. Nevertheless, this&#13;
outcome results in the commitment o f the Government to repay and extinguish all intemal debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
arrears over a period o f three years. The first year o fpayment would be covered bythe release o f&#13;
the internal debt tranche. The payments in 2006 and 2007 would have to be financed by the&#13;
Government under tight budget constraints: the repayment obligations each year are estimated to&#13;
represent roughly 3% o f Government's revenues, which i s difficult but manageable (see Table 2).&#13;
Inaddition, the Government revenues are expected to increase from 10.6% of GDP in2005 to&#13;
11.5%in 2006, and 11.9% in2007, which i s roughly a US$140 million increase each year. The&#13;
Government i s currently in the process o f planning for the 2006 State budget, to be concluded&#13;
before end-2005, and i s in close consultations with the staffs o f the Bank and the IMF inorder to&#13;
find a feasible solution. To mitigate the risk of the Government not being able to meet its&#13;
repayment obligations, however, the Government has started discussions with other donors to&#13;
seek additional financing. A debt buy back operation by a commercial bank involving a MIGA&#13;
guarantee i s also under consideration.&#13;
&#13;
                                       VI.      CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
27.    All conditions for the release of the civil service retirement and internal debt tranches of&#13;
the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit have been met. Overall execution of the&#13;
Government's economic program i s satisfactory, and the macroeconomic framework i s&#13;
consistent with the objectives o f the program.       Implementation o f and preparations for the&#13;
programs supported by this credit are satisfactory. The Government o f the Democratic Republic&#13;
o f Congo has therefore been advised that the civil service retirement floating tranche, in an&#13;
amount o f SDR 32.1 million, and the internal debt floating tranche, in an amount o f SDR 28.8&#13;
million, are now available for disbursement.&#13;

                 Status of Executionof Letter of DevelopmentPolicy as of June 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 A-1.    Performance in execution o f policy measures contained in the Letter o f Development&#13;
 Policy (LDP) has been broadly satisfactory despite a difficult security and political environment.&#13;
 Implementation progress has been made in diverse areas such as preparation o f the full PRSP,&#13;
 demobilization and reinsertion o f former combatants, civil service management reforms, public&#13;
 expenditure management, public enterprise reforms, social sector and rural development, and&#13;
 infrastructure. In some areas, notably mining and forestry, the Government has made less&#13;
 progress and some reforms are delayed. A summary o f progress i s outlined below according to&#13;
 the main areas o f the Letter o f Development Policy: (A) poverty; (B) maintaining peace and&#13;
 improving governance; (C) Financial sector, (D) Private sector development, (E) public&#13;
 enterprise reform; (F) natural resources management; (G)social sectors; (H) agriculture and rural&#13;
 development; and (I)     infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
 A.      Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 A-2.    The preparation o f the PRSP is inprogress according to the revised plan. The community&#13;
 consultations for the entire country were completed in April 2005. The results will feed into the&#13;
 Provincial PRSPs under preparation. The sectoral consultations have been completed, and the&#13;
 first draft o f sectoral and thematic strategies was shared with the development partners. The first&#13;
 draft o f the PRSP based on comments made by the JSA was completed in March 2005 as&#13;
planned. The 1-2-3 survey on employment, the informal sector, and household consumption i s&#13;
underway. However, since the launching o f this survey was delayed, it i s now likely that the&#13;
results will not be incorporated into the initial full PRSP which is planed to be adopted before&#13;
end 2005. The completion and a year o f satisfactory execution o f the full PRSP is a HIPC&#13;
completion point trigger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       MaintainingPeaceandImprovingGovernance&#13;
&#13;
A-3. Security sector reform is supported through the national Demobilization,Disarmament,&#13;
and Reinsertion (DDR) program, launched in December 2003, The institutional structure to&#13;
steer and implement the national program was established and the DDR program finalized in&#13;
January 2004 after consultations and national dissemination. After some delay, the disarmament&#13;
and demobilization phase has begun in March 2005, and the reinsertion and reintegration phase&#13;
will start by September 2005. World Bank financing supports the demobilization, reinsertion&#13;
and reintegration parts for the DDR program. Security sector reform activities are financed by&#13;
other donors.&#13;
&#13;
A-4.     As concrete steps to fight against corruption and efforts to improve governance, a&#13;
decree on a Code o f Good Conduct for Civil Servants and a law against money laundering and&#13;
financing o f terrorism were enacted. While the Code i s being publicized all around the country, a&#13;
financial intelligence unit for anti-money laundering has been established, and the law's&#13;
implementing decrees are being prepared, The anti-corruption law has been adopted by the&#13;
Parliament inNovember 2004 and promulgated inMarch2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 A-5.   There has been significant progress in public expenditure management under the&#13;
 Government's program. The public expenditure classification has been completely revised in&#13;
 conformity to international standards, Modernization and streamlining o f public expenditure&#13;
 procedures were achieved by end 2003. The progress made allows the government to analyze its&#13;
 expenditures better, as well as to disseminate the budget execution results for improved&#13;
 transparency. A poverty expenditure monitoring committee, which verifies the progress made in&#13;
 combatingpoverty, was established in2003. In2004, the government started the production o f&#13;
 budget execution reports using the new economic, administrative, and functional classifications.&#13;
 The reports also present budget execution results o f poverty-related spending and HIPC-financed&#13;
 expenditures. However, further improvements in budget reporting are necessary. A simpZiJied&#13;
 double-entry accounting system at the Treasury Directorate should be implemented by mid 2005.&#13;
 (Production o f quarterly budget execution reports and adoption o f a full-fledged double-entry&#13;
 accounting system are HIPC completion point triggers),&#13;
&#13;
 A-6.   A Country Financial Accountability Assessment was conducted in 2005.                  The&#13;
 preliminary draft shows that the country has made progress inthe area o f financial accountability&#13;
 since the Transition govemment took power, but there are still many reforms that need to be&#13;
 implemented. Urgent reforms include modernizing the legal andregulatory structure, makingthe&#13;
budget preparation cycle more in synch with the fiscal year, decrease extra-budgetary and&#13;
 emergency expenditures, improve the accuracy and frequency o f budget execution reports,&#13;
 strengthen administrative and legal monitoring and sanctions, enhance human capital, rehabilitate&#13;
the capacity to manage debt, and provide adequate equipment and tools for the civil servants to&#13;
 carry out their jobs. The draft will be presented to the Government ina workshop inmid-2005.&#13;
&#13;
A-7.    A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was conducted in 2003 with the&#13;
World Bank assistance, and the Government adopted its action plan in September 2004. The&#13;
steering committee - Commission de Rkforme des March&amp; Publics (COREMAP) - was created&#13;
inOctober 2004 andthe Executive Secretary was appointed inMarch2005. The process to select&#13;
(i) consultants who will propose a new legal and institutional framework and (ii) consultants who&#13;
will conduct the assessment o f the procurement capacity is close to be completed.            The&#13;
preparation, adoption and implementation o f the new procurement code and its principal&#13;
application decrees, a HIPC completion point trigger, are planned for 2005 - 2006.&#13;
&#13;
A-8.    Payroll reforms are also underway: the payroll system procedures were audited in o f&#13;
2004; a simplified transitional payroll system is expected to be operational by October 2005 with&#13;
the help o f French Cooperation; discussions are underway to introduce a full-fledged system o f&#13;
managing the civil service administration and payroll.&#13;
&#13;
A-9.    Civil service management reforms started with institutional studies o f selected&#13;
ministries. A civil service census has been conducted inKinshasa, and the results are expected to&#13;
be available in June 2005. The census o f the rest o f the country will be launched inthe second&#13;
half o f 2005 after the Kinshasa results are analyzed and necessary modifications and&#13;
improvements on census technique are made.             Meanwhile, surveys of service users and&#13;
providers (Institutional and Governance Review) in the entire country, focusing on territorial&#13;
administration, health, education and justice, have been carried out and the draft report issued.&#13;
The final report will be formally delivered to the client inJune 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-10. Decentralizationis an important responsibility placed on the Transition government by&#13;
the peace accord. A draft law on territorial organization was prepared by the Government, ledby&#13;
the Ministry o f Interior, and has been submitted to Parliament. The World Bank supported a&#13;
parliamentary review o f the draft law in September 2004. However, since then discussions&#13;
towards the adoption have not moved forward.&#13;
&#13;
A-11. Judicial reformis underway as indicated inthe LDP. A review ofthe Congolesejudicial&#13;
system has been completed with a broad EU diagnostic report presented in November 2004.&#13;
Outcomes o f the review will serve to finalize the action plan after they have beenvalidated in a&#13;
workshop to be organized in2005.&#13;
&#13;
A-12, Financial sector reforms to modemizing and strengthening the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework are being implementedwith the support o f the IMF:new laws governing the Central&#13;
Bank, commercial banks, and savings institutions were enacted (2002). The Central Bank has&#13;
continued to implement its action plan aiming at strengthening its administrative and&#13;
management capabilities. Rehabilitation o f Bukavu and Kisangani branches are underway with&#13;
the support of the Bank (PUSPRES). Furthermore, the Central Bank undertook studies on the&#13;
issuance o f new bank notes, and it issued new instructions defining the conditions for the&#13;
licensing and management o f microfinance institutions. Following an audit, five commercial&#13;
banks adopted a restructuring plan approved by the Central Bank, and two were closed, bringing&#13;
the total ofbanks inliquidationto five.&#13;
&#13;
A-13. Private Sector Development has focused on judicial reform, improving the investment&#13;
climate (e.g., taxation, labor regulations, administrative procedures affecting business), and&#13;
reduction o f public debt owed to domestic private sector. The principal reforms have been the&#13;
adoption o f new investment and labor codes (2002), the creation o f commercial tribunals (2002),&#13;
the designation of personnel to work at the commercial tribunals (2003 and ongoing), the&#13;
creation o f and support to a national arbitration center (June 2003), the establishment o f the&#13;
investment promotion agency (2002), and the installment o f a Single Customs Window (Guichet&#13;
Unique) at the Port o f Matadi (2003). Taxation has been improved by the publication o f new&#13;
customs tariffs (2002-2003) and customs code (June 2004), the elimination o f certain fiscal and&#13;
parafiscal levies (2003), the preparation o f an action plan for reform o f direct and indirect&#13;
taxation o f firms (2004). The government has adopted in 2004 some o f the main application&#13;
decrees for the new labor code and has completed the preparatory work for the adoption o f the&#13;
OHADA legislation. The DRC has also become a member o f the African Trade Insurance&#13;
Agency. A comprehensive audit was undertaken in 2004 o f business-related administrative&#13;
procedures, The government has also moved to reduce the weight o f domestic debt on the&#13;
business community: an action plan was prepared to resolve problems o f intemal debt based on&#13;
the audit ofthe government arrears to theprivate sector (2004, see main text).&#13;
&#13;
C.     PublicEnterpriseReform&#13;
&#13;
A-14. Public enterprise reform began in September 2001, followed by the creation o f a Public&#13;
Enterprise Reform Commission (COPIREP) in 2002, and the nomination o f an executive&#13;
secretary and two deputies in 2003. COPIREP has delivered to the Government the accounting&#13;
and operational audits o f certain enterprises (2003), formed sectoral working groups (2004) that&#13;
are preparing the reform o f public enterprises in these sectors. As a result o f these audits, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Government has restructured GECAMINES (see para. below) and has re-trenched some 3500&#13;
 workers from the national post and Telecomm Company. The Government has also instituted&#13;
 the Telecomm regulatory commission.           Finally, new judicial and regulatory frameworks on&#13;
 public enterprises and private/public partnerships have been prepared by the Government and are&#13;
 now being considered inParliament.&#13;
&#13;
 D.      Natural Resources Management&#13;
&#13;
 A-15. In the forestry sector, a new code was adopted in 2002, and its application decrees are&#13;
 being prepared. Basedon the new code, a moratorium onnew logging contracts was imposed, some&#13;
 existing contracts inconsistent with this new code were cancelled (2002), and the list o f cancelled&#13;
 contracts was published. In addition, the new area tax is being collected and Ministry o f&#13;
 Environment is about to cancel the remaining non-compliant contracts, while the Ministry o f&#13;
 Finance intends to transfer soon to local governments their share o f forestry revenues. A new&#13;
 application decree which stipulates the principles for the review o f forestry concessions is being&#13;
 prepared. The new decree will make the use o f an independent observer mandatory, include&#13;
 representatives o f other ministries as well as Ministry o fEnvironment inthe review committee, and&#13;
 banexceptions that would make verification o fcompliance difficult.&#13;
&#13;
 A-16. Inthe mining sector, a new code was also adopted (2002), its application decrees were&#13;
 prepared (2003), publicized, and distributed nationwide (2004).      The financial management o f&#13;
 the mining cadastre is being restructured, An arbitration commission on validation o f mining&#13;
 titles was created as planned in2003, but stopped activities because it was notjudged sufficiently&#13;
 independent. The cleanup o f mining titles will begin once this commission becomes operational&#13;
 after the members are nominated and confirmed. The restructuring o f GCcamines has proceeded&#13;
with a diagnostic audit leading to a presentation o f options for restructuring, and the final report&#13;
was submitted in November 2003. A voluntary departure program for excess workers was&#13;
completed in January 2004. The examination o f existing agreements and preparation o f statutes&#13;
o f a new company, to have been completed by June 2004, are ongoing: the restructuring strategy&#13;
has been validated at the government level; a management contract has been negotiated with an&#13;
international firm and is to be signed before August 2005. The finalized strategy i s to be adopted&#13;
bythe Parliament before the implementation begins inmid2005.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Social sectors&#13;
&#13;
A-17. In health sector, the government policy and efforts focused on the revitalization o f&#13;
health care centers so as they can provide essential and basic services to a maximum o f the&#13;
Congolese population. To that end the Government have signed service contracts expeditiously&#13;
with eight execution agencies/NGOs           for the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and&#13;
Reconstruction Project (PMURR), in order to achieve visible results in improving basic service&#13;
delivery, notably towards mother and child diseases prevention and, malaria by the provision o f&#13;
bed nets and child vaccination. On the basis o f the PER 2004 conclusions about the resources&#13;
transferred to the operational level and, the low frequentation rate o f the health centers by the&#13;
population despite investments done by the donors, important discussions have been engaged on&#13;
how to increase the accessibility o f the population to health services. A more comprehensive,&#13;
inclusive and transparent budget preparation, processing and transfer to operational levels, is&#13;
underway. The country health status report has been finalized in December 2004 and will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 disseminated duringthe summer. A sectoral strategy will be prepared by 2006, which will guide&#13;
 efforts to reform the regulatory andbudgetary framework o f the sector (thisi s a H P C completion&#13;
 point trigger).&#13;
&#13;
 A-18. On the HIV/AIDS, as part o f the Government efforts to address the growingthreat posed&#13;
 by the epidemic, a National HIV/AIDS/STDs strategic plan has been adopted in 1999. Its&#13;
 objective i s to contribute to slowing the spread o f HIV/AIDS and mitigating its impact on&#13;
 families, communities and productive sectors. The reform introducedin 2003 has beenthe move&#13;
 from a health care vision to a multi-sectoral approach that involves a wide range o f actors in&#13;
 various spheres o f the DRC society (public, private, confessional and communities). The&#13;
 Government strategy i s based on a a 3 interrelated pillars: the prevention for reducing all&#13;
 transmission risks; the treatment and improvement o f quality live o f those already infected by a&#13;
 free distribution o f ARVs and the socio-economic mitigation o f the epidemic impact on&#13;
 vulnerable groups. Provision o f free ARVs i s being implemented throughout the country,&#13;
 however it i s important that the Government found a sustainable solution to the financial charges&#13;
 that the persons living with HIV/AIDS have to face with for the biological exams they should do&#13;
 every quarter.&#13;
&#13;
 A-19. The education sector has completed a first phase o f emergency rehabilitation with&#13;
 assistance from the World Bank and the second phase i s on target. Results in the first phase&#13;
 include 140 schools rehabilitated through the education component o f the Emergency Multi-&#13;
 sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRRP). An additional US$5 million for&#13;
 rehabilitationin education was provided through EMRRP's Community Development and Social&#13;
 Protection components; and a further US$11 million from the PSRE, PURR and PUSPRES (for&#13;
 all levels: primary school to university).The second phase o f rehabilitation will be supported by&#13;
 the EMRRP and a new Education Sector Project under preparation in2005. The new project will&#13;
 also provide resources to initiate broader reform, o f the institutional, regulatory and budgetary&#13;
 framework o f the sector. Government is developing the sectoral strategy and expects to complete&#13;
 this in2006, as targeted inthe LDP (this is a H P C completionpoint trigger). The strategy will&#13;
 also guide finalization o f the PRSP, and draws from the country education status report, now&#13;
disseminated, and the action plan for "Education for All." Using HIPC funds for 2005,&#13;
Government i s piloting grant transfers to primary and secondary schools to finance frais de&#13;
fonctionnement, thereby offsetting some fee costs for households.&#13;
&#13;
A-20. Inthe area o f social protection, a qualitative risk and vulnerability study was conducted&#13;
(2003). A global program for social protection was developed based on the completed studies,&#13;
and has beenfinalized.&#13;
&#13;
F.       Agriculture and RuralDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
A-21. The target o f increasing output in agriculture has been addressed by a seed program&#13;
(begun in 2002 and in progress), rehabilitation of 850 hectare of irrigated land by 2005&#13;
(ongoing), and studies to improve aviculture, small livestock raising, fish farms, and local fishing&#13;
(launched in 2004 and in progress). Improvement in access to local markets through&#13;
rehabilitation o f 5000 km o f rural tracks started in 2004 and i s scheduled to last through June&#13;
2005. The first phase o f the program, supported under the PMURR, covers approximately 1200&#13;
km, and is scheduled to be completed by December 2005. The introduction of an information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
system on market prices for agricultural products is underway. The Government i s developing a&#13;
rural strategy, which is to be completed in 2006. The adoption of this strategy i s a HPC&#13;

&#13;
A-22. On infrastructure, the LDP focuses on two main objectives: (i)rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance o f existing infrastructure and (ii)legal and regulatory framework reforms. An&#13;
international firm was selected in2002 to manage the infrastructure components o f the PMURR,&#13;
and technical design studies were launched in 2003. Road works are underway since 2004 and&#13;
scheduled to last through 2006, following the selection and mobilization o f contractors through&#13;
international competitive bidding. Inurban infrastructure, the execution o f two important works&#13;
(Kasa-Vubu urban rehabilitation and Selembao erosion works) began in 2004 and i s expected to&#13;
end in late 2005. Other transportation infrastructure works are about to start with a slight delay.&#13;
Inelectricity, a studyon the state of SNEL installations was completed inJuly2004, andurgent&#13;
works on rehabilitating production capacity at 600 megawatts are to be conducted in2005-2007.&#13;
Inwater, selectedpublic rehabilitationwork has started, andwill continue through 2006.&#13;
&#13;
A-23. Since 2003, new legal and regulatory frameworks for the petroleum, energy, and water&#13;
sectors are being prepared. The Ministry o f Energy began this work before COPIREP started to&#13;
supervise the activity, and the two institutions have now taken the work up together.&#13;

            in civil service retirement, in resolution of internal debt,
            and in centralized payment of government public utilities
