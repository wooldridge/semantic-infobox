               PERSPECTIVES ON WBI'S FY06 PERFORMANCE IN FOCUS COUNTRIES&#13;
&#13;
         To assess the World Bank Institute's performance in its 34 focus countries in FY06 from&#13;
the perspective of operational staff, the Institute's Evaluation Group (WBIEG) surveyed 61&#13;
senior members of country management teams (CMT) in early FY07.1 The surveys asked&#13;
respondents to provide their opinions of WBI's activities in the countries for which they were&#13;
responsible. Five people received two or more surveys because of their responsibilities for&#13;
several WBI focus countries, such as in central Asia.&#13;
&#13;
         For each country, the WBI's Regional Coordination Unit (WBIRC) identified the two&#13;
CMT members it believed to be most knowledgeable about WBI's activities, typically the&#13;
country director and country manager. WBI's vice president asked these people to complete the&#13;
online survey on August 14, and sent a reminder on September 5, 2006. In mid September,&#13;
WBIEG's manager called and emailed nonrespondents, again soliciting their response.&#13;
&#13;
Response rate and respondent profile&#13;
&#13;
         Of the 61 people surveyed, 51 responded (84 percent), providing information on 32 of the&#13;
34 focus countries. No one responded from Ghana or Burkina Faso. Table 1 provides the&#13;
response rates by region.&#13;

&#13;
         Despite the targeting of potential respondents, several people said that they were not&#13;
sufficiently informed of WBI's activities to respond knowledgeably. For that reason they did not&#13;
respond. This is of interest because WBIRC had identified people to be surveyed on the basis of&#13;
their presumed familiarity with WBI's activities. Table 2 indicates the response rate by title.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Quantitative results&#13;
&#13;
        The survey was intentionally brief to encourage responses, and the reader should be&#13;
aware that responses reflect opinions and perceptions about WBI's performance and&#13;
effectiveness. In several instances, because some respondents are based in Washington, the&#13;
respondents may be familiar with WBI's activities and personnel in Washington but not have&#13;
first-hand experience with WBI's activities, the participants' reactions to them, or how well&#13;
WBI's efforts have addressed particular gaps or deficiencies in capacity.&#13;
&#13;
        With these caveats in mind, it is nonetheless important to note that the respondents were&#13;
pleased with the services WBI provided in FY06. Senior operational counterparts particularly&#13;
appreciated the way WBI consulted with them to select its activities, with 98 percent rating the&#13;
consultation in FY06 as satisfactory to a large extent or better. The consultations were perceived&#13;
to be effective in helping WBI understand the capacity development needs of the country and&#13;
align its activities with these needs (87 percent rating these aspects to a large extent or higher).&#13;
See table 3.&#13;
&#13;
        While WBI performs well in a priori consultation, it could improve its information to the&#13;
CMT about the activities' results. The latter question (Q2) was rated significantly lower than the&#13;
former (Q1a).2&#13;
&#13;
        Though the activities were aligned to a large extent or better with the perceived capacity&#13;
needs in each focus country (Q3a), the effectiveness in building capacity in the countries (Q3b)&#13;
was rated less well. Seventy-three percent of the respondents indicated that WBI's activities&#13;
were effective to a large extent or better in building capacity.&#13;
&#13;
        Operational counterparts considered that WBI activities were slightly better, better, or&#13;
much better than equivalent capacity development activities from local organizations (87&#13;
percent) or donor organizations (81 percent). When compared with the rest of the Bank,&#13;
however, 43 percent said that WBI activities were at least slightly better, and 44 percent found&#13;
them to be about the same (table 4).&#13;
&#13;
        No significant differences were identified on any question between low-income and&#13;
middle-income countries. The limited number of responses (due to the small population&#13;
surveyed) prevents any meaningful comparison of the ratings per region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Open-ended responses:&#13;
&#13;
       The survey included two open-ended questions. Respondents were asked how WBI&#13;
could improve its effectiveness in each focus country and whether they had any additional&#13;
comments. Forty-three people provided comments.&#13;
&#13;
Overall assessment of WBI in FY06&#13;
&#13;
       Respondent's overall assessment of WBI was positive (30 respondents with positive&#13;
assessment, 4 respondents with some critical comments, and 9 respondents without explicit&#13;
judgment). Among the positive responses, 13 people explicitly noted improvements in WBI's&#13;
performance over the past few years. All regions had respondents with positive assessments of&#13;
WBI activities, and at least one respondent in each region reported some progress.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of relation between WBI and Bank Operations&#13;
&#13;
       WBI's collaboration with the country teams was well perceived and assessed positively.&#13;
Similarly, respondents from all regions assessed this aspect positively. Eleven respondents&#13;
indicated that they would like to see continuous collaboration, dialogue, and consultation&#13;
between WBI and their country teams. Five respondents acknowledged the effective liaison&#13;
between WBI and country teams but still mentioned the need for further proactive collaboration.&#13;
One respondent expressed the need to develop WBI's own capacity and to "integrate more with&#13;
the country team to help it with implementation."&#13;
&#13;
       Here is an example of one person's opinion:&#13;
&#13;
       Our collaboration has improved much over the past few years. The WBI team consults&#13;
       with the country team extensively in developing the country program and it has become a&#13;
       norm for both teams to agree on an annual work program at the start of FY. It would&#13;
       improve the effectiveness of the program further if the WBI team also coordinated more&#13;
       closely with the country team in its implementation of the agreed work program. At times,&#13;
       agreed courses were not implemented due to the lack of financial resources. This could&#13;
       have been avoided had the country management team been informed of the situation (we&#13;
       could have mobilized external resources in the field to augment the WBI resources).&#13;
&#13;
       Relatively well-perceived relationships between WBI and the country teams may be&#13;
contributing to the positive assessment of WBI activities' alignment with CAS and integration&#13;
with operations. Nine respondents commented favorably that WBI's activities are aligned with&#13;
country assistance strategies, while two respondents expressed the need for more decisive&#13;
alignment. Eight respondents commented that WBI activities are well coordinated with country&#13;
programs and contributed to projects, while two said they would like to see more consultation&#13;
and integration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Resources&#13;
&#13;
        Respondents from all regions, except LAC, expressed the need for WBI to increase its&#13;
resources  human (five respondents) and/or financial (three respondents). Two respondents&#13;
asked that WBI concentrate on fewer activities and avoid extending its focus. As one person&#13;
wrote, just as "quality and coordination were improving, WBI country budgets were substantially&#13;
cut thus limiting the opportunity for strategic interventions and high impact."&#13;
&#13;
        Five respondents expressed the need for WBI to develop staff capacity. They would like&#13;
staff/speakers/trainers with highly specialized skills to be responsive to the country needs and&#13;
offer high quality programs. As one respondent commented, WBI needs "real practitioners that&#13;
can discuss the `nuts and bolts' of reform and answer pointed questions rather than resource&#13;
persons that speak in rather general terms."&#13;
&#13;
        In addition, five respondents acknowledged the importance of local WBI staff and how&#13;
effective they are. Four respondents said that they would like to have a WBI staff member&#13;
posted locally. Two also suggested better resource allocation for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
        In contrast to the generally positive reactions to locally based WBI staff, some&#13;
respondents also indicated their frustration with what appeared to be the limited decision-making&#13;
authority granted to WBI liaisons with the country teams. A comment from one person illustrates&#13;
this concern. He noted that the liaison between WBI and his country team has the best intentions&#13;
and works hard in listening to the team's demands. Nonetheless, the respondent observed, "the&#13;
liaison seems to have no power to make thing happen within WBI. As a result the response time&#13;
to needs that are central to our team is over a year. That means that we can't use the&#13;
opportunities we constantly have to make a difference with WBI's help."&#13;
&#13;
        Several people mentioned their concerns about the unexpected logistical burdens that&#13;
WBI activities occasionally impose on country offices. Here is an illustrative comment: "WBI&#13;
should also ensure that when they engage in a program they fully commit to its organization &#13;
[country] team members have complained that some WBI events require a lot of the CMTs' time&#13;
in logistics, etc. which is counterproductive."&#13;
&#13;
Suggestions about WBI activities&#13;
&#13;
        Ten respondents suggested topics that they want WBI to cover according to the country's&#13;
specific needs. Half of the suggestions were specifically related to ongoing projects or&#13;
initiatives. In addition, there was a request to focus on the "how to" aspect rather than "why" or&#13;
"what to do."&#13;
&#13;
        As for the delivery approach, one respondent mentioned that he would like WBI to&#13;
contribute to a "large-scale policy reform" rather than project-level interventions. Another&#13;
respondent asked how WBI can "pull together the various WBI activities into a cohesive, critical&#13;
mass  rather than a seeming cluster of useful interventions."&#13;
&#13;
        In addition, respondents from AFR (2), ECA (1), and LAC (1) indicated that they would&#13;
like a feedback/follow-up system of activities and results after the events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        On a critical note, some respondents complained that WBI's activities were "largely&#13;
supply driven" or not suitably responsive to the country's needs. As one person noted, there are&#13;
still "entrepreneurs" within WBI who are not effectively using the locally based WBI&#13;
coordinator, with detrimental consequences for the use of staff times, budgets, and contracts for&#13;
consultants. Still another person asked that WBI "focus on the agreed program and avoid&#13;
apparent incentives to WBI staff to build new activities all the time."&#13;
&#13;
Suggested improvement in WB/WBI processes&#13;
&#13;
        For better coordination of the activities, some respondents mentioned coordination within&#13;
WBI or with other Bank groups. Three respondents asked for better coordination within WBI,&#13;
especially more effective use of regional coordinators in planning/organizing events. One&#13;
respondent positively assessed WBI's work with other parts of the Bank group and another&#13;
suggested coordinating with IFC.&#13;
&#13;
        In addition, eight respondents mentioned the positive contribution of specific staff&#13;
members in the success of the activities. One mentioned that there can be a direct feedback&#13;
system on this aspect, noting that "the variation (of TTLs) in WBI is very high."&#13;
&#13;
Next steps&#13;
&#13;
        WBIEG will repeat the survey of CMTs in early FY08, asking respondents in each focus&#13;
country their opinions of WBI activities in FY07. The number of desired respondents per country&#13;
will likely be increased to three from two.&#13;

            Perspectives on WBI's FY06 performance
            in focus countries

        <abstracts>
            This paper summarizes the World Bank
            Institute's (WBI) performance in its 34 focus countries
            in FY06 from the perspective of operational staff, the
            Institute's Evaluation Group (WBIEG) surveyed 61 senior
            members of country management teams (CMT) in early FY07. The
            surveys asked respondents to provide their opinions of
            WBI's activities in the countries for which they were
            responsible. This report concludes that WBIEG will repeat
            the survey of CMTs in early FY08, asking respondents in each
            focus country their opinions of WBI activities in FY07. The
            survey was intentionally brief to encourage responses, and
            the reader should be aware that responses reflect opinions
            and perceptions about WBI's performance and effectiveness.
