        <abstracts>
            Infrastructure concession contracts set
            out the performance obligations and rights of
            concessionaires and the incentives and risks under which
            they operate, including pricing arrangements. The clarity
            with which these terms can be defined determines whether
            there is likely to be renegotiations after contract award,
            which may undermine the significance of the initial auction.
            The design of incentives and risk allocation will affect
            first the intensity of competition and then the
            sustainability of the original contract. This Note examines
            these issues.
