THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF&#13;
INADEQUATE SANITATION IN INDIA&#13;

&amp;#12;What were the total economic impacts&#13;
due to inadequate sanitation in India?&#13;
The study estimates that the total economic impacts of inadequate&#13;
sanitation in India amounts to Rs. 2.44 trillion (US$53.8 billion) a&#13;
year1â&#128;&#148;this was the equivalent of 6.4 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP in 2006.&#13;
This means a per person annual impact of Rs. 2,180 (US$48).2&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, the human and social handicaps                                          What is Inadequate Sanitation?&#13;

developing countries, especially the poor, has been                                      Sanitation is broadly defined to include management of&#13;

   Governments and households are seeking to                                             and associated hygiene behavior. This is not to discount&#13;
address the significant deficits in the provision of safe                                the importance of the other aspects, but to focus on&#13;
sanitation facilities. However, inadequate sanitation                                    the key dimensions that cause a substantial health burden&#13;
imposes substantial economic losses but these have                                       on Indians, especially poor people and children.&#13;

including those on availability and quality of drinking                                  and hygienic practices (for example, hand washing,&#13;
water, welfare losses, tourism, and so on. The                                           proper water handling, personal hygiene, and so on)&#13;

  In Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms, with the price level in India being about a third of the USA, the adverse economic impacts of inadequate sanitation in India&#13;
is US$161 billion, or US$144 per person. Of the Rs. 2.4 trillion lost, about Rs. 1.1 trillion signifies the loss of flow of economic value of 2006, and the balance&#13;

latrines or those without a slab, and facilities draining into or open areas (that is, not to piped sewer system, septic tank or pit latrine); and shared toilets. In addition,&#13;
unhygienic practices further expose people to health risks.&#13;

                                           to estimate the populations impacted by inadequate sanitation and, finally, the&#13;
                                           economic valuation was carried out using costs/prices based on other&#13;

                                       urban average (Rs. 1,037, US$22.9). Rural households in the poorest&#13;
                                       quintile bear per capita losses in excess of Rs. 1,000 (US$22)â&#128;&#148;which is&#13;
                                       8 percent more than the average loss for households in rural areas&#13;
                                       (Rs. 930, $20.5). The total losses for the rural households in the poorest&#13;
                                       quintile is substantial (Rs. 204 billion, US$4.5 billion) as compared to&#13;
                                       their counterparts in urban areas (Rs. 16 billion, US$0.35 billion).&#13;

  This will include increased use of toilets, hygiene promotion (including hand washing with soap and safe water management), and improved access to water. This is based&#13;
on meta-studies that estimated the relative risk-reduction to diarrhea by adopting these measures. It may be noted, however, that a number of external factors prevent&#13;
elimination of risks completely and therefore, potential gains in sanitation are a sub-set of the losses.&#13;

Economics of Sanitation&#13;
The Economics of Sanitation Initiative was launched in 2007 as a response by the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (www.wsp.org) to address major gaps in evidence among developing&#13;
countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. The study aims to provide evidence that&#13;
supports sanitation advocacy, elevates the profile of sanitation, and acts as an effective tool&#13;
to convince governments to take action.&#13;
   The first study completed in Southeast Asia found that the economic costs of poor&#13;
sanitation and hygiene amounted to over US$9.2 billion a year (2005 prices) in Cambodia,&#13;
Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Its second phase analyzes the cost-benefit&#13;
of alternative sanitation interventions and will enable stakeholders to make decisions on how&#13;
to spend funds allocated to sanitation more efficiently.&#13;
   Due to the studyâ&#128;&#153;s successful traction, WSP has now carried out an ESI study in India,&#13;
with others in progress for Bangladesh and Pakistan. ESI studies are also planned for&#13;
countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This study estimates that a package of
            comprehensive sanitation and hygiene interventions can
            result in averting 45 percent of adverse health impacts, and
            avoid all the adverse impacts of inadequate sanitation
            related to water, welfare, and tourism losses. As a result
            of comprehensive interventions, this study estimates a
            potential gain of about Rs. 1.48 trillion (US$32.6 billion,
            which was the equivalent of 3.9 percent of Gross Domestic
            Product, or GDP in 2006). This signifies a potential gain of
            Rs. 1,321 (US$29) per capita. Estimates of the potential
            sanitation markets were made assuming expansion in access to
            improved toilets and wastewater treatment as a result of
            increased investments by the Government (in infrastructure
            creation and operations and maintenance) and households
            (investing in improved sanitation facilities). The national
            cumulative sanitation market has the potential of Rs. 6.87
            trillion (US$152 billion) over the 2007-2020 period, with
            Rs. 4.4 trillion (US$97 billion or 64 percent) in
            infrastructure and Rs. 2.5 trillion (US$54 billion or 36
            percent) in operations and maintenance services. The annual
            sanitation market is estimated to grow from Rs. 300 billion
            (US$6.6 billion) in 2007, to Rs. 683 billion (US$15.1
            billion) in 2020.
