   Bank technical assistance to the Ministry of Local Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s National Capacity Development&#13;
&amp;#12;Framework for Union Parishads to improve water and sanitation services in Bangladesh. This support&#13;
sought to strengthen peer-to-peer or â&#128;&#152;horizontalâ&#128;&#153; learning processes amongst Union Parishads and&#13;
improve horizontal accountability communications and monitoring systems within the sector. The&#13;
strategic focus has been on strengthening the long-term capacity of the Government and in particular at&#13;
the lowest decentralized tier of local government responsible for ensuring safe water and sanitation&#13;
services for all. Outputs from this World Bank technical assistance are collated in eleven annexures.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
1.    The objective of this World Bank technical assistance has been to support the Government of&#13;
      Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s National Capacity Development Framework for Improving Water and Sanitation&#13;
      Services (WSS) in Bangladesh, focusing on demand-responsive peer-to-peer or â&#128;&#152;horizontalâ&#128;&#153; learning&#13;
      processes and improve horizontal accountability communication and monitoring systems to track&#13;
      progress in the sector. This technical assistance is in line with the World Bank Country Assistance&#13;
      Strategy (CAS 2011-14, extended until FY15) which seeks to support the Government of Bangladesh&#13;
      (GoB) target of ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation for all. It has contributed to&#13;
      strengthening the long-term capacity of the Government, in particular the union Parishad (UP)&#13;
      which is responsible for ensuring water and sanitation services for all in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
Context&#13;
2. Bangladesh has made significant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal&#13;
   (MDG) 7 targets for both improved water supply and sanitation access of the Bangladesh&#13;
   population. The recent WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) 2014 shows that 85% of the&#13;
   population has access to improved water supply - with the vast majority through non-piped, â&#128;&#152;other&#13;
   improvedâ&#128;&#153; sources â&#128;&#147; while 57% of the population has access to improved sanitation facilities.1&#13;
   Another 28% and 14% of the population has access to shared and unimproved sanitation facilities,&#13;
   respectively, meaning that 96% of the population has access to latrine facilities â&#128;&#147; irrespective of&#13;
   their quality â&#128;&#147; and only 3% of the population currently practices open defecation. This figure that&#13;
   has come down remarkably from 42% in 2003, in particular compared to other countries in the&#13;
   region. While Bangladesh remains off track to achieve the sanitation MDG as a whole, it has&#13;
   successfully reduced the percentage of the bottom 40% of the population without access to basic&#13;
   water and sanitation facilities.&#13;
3. While access has increased substantially, there are still significant challenges if Bangladesh is going&#13;
   to ensure safe, affordable, reliable and sustainable services for all. For sanitation, while there has&#13;
   been a significant movement in Bangladesh from â&#128;&#152;open defecationâ&#128;&#153; towards â&#128;&#152;fixed point defecation,â&#128;&#153;&#13;
   the quality of sanitation coverage is an emerging area of concern, with over 40% of all latrines&#13;
   classified as â&#128;&#152;unimprovedâ&#128;&#153; according to the JMP. For water supply, while access is widespread,&#13;
   drinking water is undermined by severe quality issues: for example, 20% of water supply faces&#13;
   arsenic contamination at source, and 12% at point of use, and service provision is often unreliable&#13;
   and intermittent.&#13;
&#13;
4. With high levels of access to basic yet affordable water and sanitation facilities the premier&#13;
   challenge for Bangladesh is ensuring the quality of water and sanitation. Given the heavy reliance on&#13;
   non-public provision of services, driving up the quality of services is primarily a regulatory challenge.&#13;
   Increasing service quality without compromising the affordability to consumers is heavily dependent&#13;
   on the capacity of local government institutions. The rural local government system comprises of&#13;
   more than 4500 directly elected union parishads and 484 upazila parishads, within 64 administered&#13;
   districts and 7 divisions that accommodate the rural 70% of the Bangladesh population.&#13;

&amp;#12;5. Given the high levels of access to basic water and sanitation services but the serious quality of&#13;
   service challenges, the World Bank has sought though this TA to improve local government capacity&#13;
   to ensure improved quality of services for all. This sought to (a) increase client capacity to identify&#13;
   and replicate good water and sanitation practices; (b) inform policy directives based on local&#13;
   practices; and (c) deepen knowledge through the open sharing of information. These outcomes&#13;
   were supported through targeted activities directed towards the following areas:&#13;
       ï&#130;· Strengthening local governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to advocate for good practices: through local&#13;
           processes to identify, share and replicate good water and sanitation practices,&#13;
       ï&#130;· Strengthening national institutions to scale up best practices: by bringing the weight of&#13;
           lessons learnt from the most replicated practices to influence policy directives.&#13;
       ï&#130;· Improving Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E): by collecting and making publicly available&#13;
           union parishad data which allows comparison between local governments.&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
6. In Bangladesh, the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives lead the&#13;
   water supply and sanitation sector. It delegates its functional responsibility to: (i) the Department of&#13;
   Public Health and Engineering (DPHE); (ii) the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED);&#13;
   (iii) the Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities (WASA); and, (iv) local authorities â&#128;&#147; Pourashavas in&#13;
   urban and the Union Parishads2 in rural Bangladesh. Government has also created a platform for&#13;
   multi-stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; partnerships, especially with non-government organizations (NGOs) that has&#13;
   played a catalytic role in the water and sanitation sector and created a synergistic effect in achieving&#13;
   the goal of safe drinking water and open defecation free status. Service delivery thus relies heavily&#13;
   on the capacity and performance of decentralized institutions, most importantly the UPs, the lowest&#13;
   tier of local government institutions in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
7. The Government of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s National Capacity Building Framework for UPs was developed with&#13;
   the support of the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of&#13;
   the World Bank. It was signed in 2011 by the Local Government Training Institutions (LGTIs), such as&#13;
   Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development, the Rural Development Academy, the Local&#13;
   Government Division (LGD), the Rural Development and Cooperatives Department of the Ministry&#13;
   for Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives and key development partners in&#13;
   addition to the World Bank such as the Swiss Development Cooperation, the United Nations&#13;
   Development Program, the European Union, and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
8. The Framework rests on two pillars of capacity development: Pillar 1) a supply-driven, core&#13;
   cascading training, which consists of training of 160 trainers of Local Government members; and,&#13;
   Pillar 2) a demand-responsive, peer or â&#128;&#152;horizontalâ&#128;&#153; learning process. Good Practices that are being&#13;
   accepted/replicated widely through â&#128;&#152;horizontal learning processâ&#128;&#153; of pillar-2, are included in the&#13;
   â&#128;&#152;supply-driven trainingâ&#128;&#153; of pillar-1.&#13;
&#13;
9. WSP has since 2007 assisted LGD in designing and applying Horizontal Learning, a peer learning&#13;
   process for UPs to identify good practices in local governance. Originally designed as a pilot, the&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
    Union Parishad is the oldest and lowest tier of local government representing 10 to 15 villages with around 5000 households.&#13;
    Nine wards (1 to 2 villages compose a ward) form a Union. Each union is composed of 13 elected representatives including a&#13;
    chair, 9 members (1 from each ward), and 3 women elected members to reserved seats based on 1 female representative for&#13;
    every 3 wards. There is a water and sanitation task force in each Union Parishad responsible for provision and maintenance of&#13;
    water and sanitation services.&#13;
                                                                                                                   7|Page&#13;
&amp;#12;   Horizontal Learning Program (HLP) was scaled up to 32 UPs by 2011, and became part of the&#13;
   National Capacity Building Framework in 2012. Through this technical assistance the World Bank has&#13;
   garnered the support of 32 development partners (Donors, NGOs &amp; Projects) to include horizontal&#13;
   learning into the Local Government Support Program II (LGSP-II) which provides financing to all&#13;
   4,500 union parishads in Bangladesh. The horizontal learning process enables union parishads to&#13;
   identify their good practices, validate these good practices and prepare fact sheets on the results.&#13;
   These good practices shared amongst peer union parishads at network workshops enables them to&#13;
   select good practices they want to adopt and replicate using their own budget.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        TA Intermediate Outcomes&#13;
10. This internal synthesis report details the intermediate&#13;
    outcomes, outputs and process of the World Bank technical&#13;
    assistance to support the national capacity development&#13;
    framework for union parishads to improve water and sanitation&#13;
    services in Bangladesh (TA-P131960).           This enabled the&#13;
    Government to adopt new processes for the identification,&#13;
    replication and institutionalization of good local government&#13;
    practices in the water and sanitation sector through a peer&#13;
    learning process of local governments. The collation and&#13;
    dissemination of best practices through various open data&#13;
    platforms has also contributed to the strengthening of data&#13;
    management and horizontal accountability. Specifically, this&#13;
    contributed to the three following interrelated intermediate outcomes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   (a) Client Capacity Increased:&#13;
       Institutionalization of the horizontal learning centre within the â&#128;&#152;Training and Consultancyâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
       Department of the National Institute for Local Government (NILG) which has increased the&#13;
       ability of NILG to manage local government capacity building. This support was also extended to&#13;
       establish district hubs (in Kurrigram, Satkhira, Moulvibazar, ChapaiNawabganj &amp; Tangail) to&#13;
       share good practices and monitor open budget allocations. This has decentralized monitoring&#13;
       and increased the open budget allocations to the replication of good union parishad practices.&#13;
       As per the national Capacity Development Framework (signed by two Government Divisions,&#13;
       three Government Training Institutes and eight Development Partners) the sharing and&#13;
       replication of the good practices is one of the core modalities for enhancing capacity of union&#13;
       parishads (to complement the supply driven core training and demand driven elective training&#13;
       modalities).&#13;
&#13;
   (b) Policy / Strategy Informed:&#13;
       In addition to improving services, the replicating of good practices by local governments using&#13;
       their own resources enables the lessons from the most replicated good practices to be collated&#13;
       and shared this with policy makers. Support from this TA for the collation, sharing and analysis&#13;
       of the most replicated good practices by union parishads has contributed to:&#13;
       ï&#130;· Revision of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Implementation Plan for Arsenic Mitigation (IPAM 2009) to&#13;
           incorporate arsenic screening as the bottom rung of the arsenic mitigation ladder.&#13;
       ï&#130;· The Local Government Division issuing a circular to institutionalize the Union Development&#13;
           Coordination Committee (UDCC) Meetings empowering UPs to coordinate service providers.&#13;
                                                                                            8|Page&#13;
&amp;#12;       ï&#130;·   The development of an infrastructure manual for union parishads based on the collation of&#13;
           their own good practices in implementing capital works for roads, drains, culverts and&#13;
           embankments.&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The utilization of collated audit data to calculate performance grants based on own source&#13;
           revenue under the Second Local Governance Support Project (LGSP II).&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The issuing of the â&#128;&#152;Hard to Reach Area Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitationâ&#128;&#153; by the&#13;
           Ministry of Local Government directing government and donor investments to union&#13;
           parishads with high water and sanitation poverty (i.e. poor composite water, sanitation,&#13;
           poverty scores).&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The Local Government Division issuing a government circular prioritizing disability inclusive&#13;
           investments through the adoption of non-excludable targets and non-excludable means.&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The successful replication of â&#128;&#152;100% sanitationâ&#128;&#153; good practices by local governments&#13;
           contributing to a reduction in the prevalence of open defecation to less than 1% in&#13;
           Bangladesh.&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The extension of policy support for pure public goods (i.e. non-rival and non-excludable&#13;
           targets that include 100% sanitation, 100% screening for arsenic, 100% tube well&#13;
           protection).&#13;
&#13;
   (c) Knowledge Deepened&#13;
       The strengthening of systems for horizontal accountability of local governments improves&#13;
       information flow about what works and what does not work in local level service provision&#13;
       across the country. Encouraging the sharing of knowledge with peers makes data more&#13;
       accessible. This TA has contributed to establishing open knowledge systems that include:&#13;
       ï&#130;· The establishment of a water supply and sanitation open data platform for the collation and&#13;
           visualization of secondary data sets associated with the WASH sector in Bangladesh.&#13;
       ï&#130;· The establishment of a geospatial data sharing platform (GEODASH) that enables the&#13;
           uploading/ storing / sharing / searching / downloading of GIS data sets for Bangladesh.&#13;
       ï&#130;· The promotion and extension of capacity for the crowd sourcing of mapping information in&#13;
           Bangladesh for water supply and sanitation on the OpenStreetMapping platform.&#13;
       ï&#130;· The establishment of the Union Parishad Help Line for the two-way dissemination and&#13;
           collation of information from local governments via SMS, robocall, IVRS and phone surveys.&#13;
       ï&#130;· Support for Horizontal Learning interactive systems that include SMS blog, twitter feed to&#13;
           billboard, facebook group and facebook page to share union parishad good practices.&#13;
       ï&#130;· The hosting of water and sanitation hackathons fostering the development of IT applications&#13;
           that address WASH issues and promote the sharing of data / systems knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Process                                                      â&#128;&#152;Value Addedâ&#128;&#153; of Horizontal Learning Processes&#13;
13. Conventional capacity building programs usually&#13;
    starts with assumption that â&#128;&#156;there is a lack of&#13;

    â&#128;&#152;whenâ&#128;&#153; these deficiencies will be addressed is&#13;
    generally decided by central capacity providers. In&#13;
    contrast, the basic assumption under this TA has&#13;
    been that capacities already exist. â&#128;&#152;Whatâ&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;howâ&#128;&#153; and&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                            9|Page&#13;
&amp;#12;    complements conventional capacity building efforts by sharing â&#128;&#152;what worksâ&#128;&#153; and allowing replication&#13;
    amongst peers to improve the environment into which capacity building is directed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14. This process recognizes that every local government can simultaneously be â&#128;&#152;a teacherâ&#128;&#153; as well as â&#128;&#152;a&#13;
    learnerâ&#128;&#153; of good practices. By monitoring what local governments choose to replicate with their own&#13;
    funds, within their own context, it is possible for development partners and national decision&#13;
    makers to learn from their collated experience. The Horizontal Learning process consists of the&#13;
    following activities:&#13;
                                                                  Horizontal Learning Process&#13;
    ï&#130;· UPs are encouraged to identify their good&#13;
         practices and the associated indicators.&#13;
    ï&#130;· UPs select the good practices they wish to&#13;
         visit in order to learn from their peers.&#13;
    ï&#130;· UPs prioritize, discuss with citizens and&#13;
         integrate appropriate good practices into&#13;
         their annual plan and budget.&#13;
    ï&#130;· UPs replicate good practices with the&#13;
         support of their peers.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Progress in replication is monitored through&#13;
         peer reviews and achievements recognized&#13;
         through the horizontal learning network&#13;
&#13;
15. Through this TA the horizontal learning process was           Horizontal Accountability Systems&#13;
    developed and its application tested amongst local&#13;
    government institutions in Bangladesh. While&#13;
    inherently difficult to systematize, this TA sought to&#13;
    demonstrate       that     strengthened       horizontal&#13;
    accountability to peers for the replication of good&#13;
    practices can;&#13;
    ï&#130;· Improve the downward accountability of local&#13;
        governments to their citizens for service delivery.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Improve the downward accountability of the&#13;
        central government to local governments to&#13;
        incorporate good practices in policy guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Results&#13;
16. The development objective of this technical assistance has been to build the capacity of the&#13;
    Government of Bangladesh, in particular local government to more efficiently deliver quality water&#13;
    and sanitation services. Under the National Capacity Development Framework, this support&#13;
    concentrated on assisting the Government in taking over the identification, replication and&#13;
    institutionalization of good practices in the water and sanitation sector. The collation and&#13;
    dissemination of learning and best practices via the open data platform and data sharing tools,&#13;
    enabled the effective sharing of results while contributing to improved monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
&#13;

CapDev Framework on the Capacity Building of Union Parishads&#13;
17. Support through this TA was extended to develop the CapDev Framework for UPs signed by 8&#13;
    donors, 2 Divisions and 3 training institutes identifying the three core components of capacity&#13;
    building. This includes (a) supply-driven training for all union parishads on core functions (through&#13;
    cascade based mechanisms); (b) demand-driven training for union parishads on elective functions&#13;
    (through accredited training providers); and (c) peer learning for union parishads to share, replicate&#13;
    and elevate good practices (through horizontal learning).&#13;
       The CapDev Framework for UPs signed by 8 DPs, 2 Divisions and 3 Institutes is included at Annex 1&#13;
&#13;
18. Support through this TA extended to the detailing of capacity building provider requirements under&#13;
    the World Bank supported second Local Governance Support Project (LGSP II). On the basis of&#13;
    extensive consultations with union parishads support by this TA, 10% of the basic block grant was&#13;
    made available to be utilized by UPs for demand driven training in the LGSP II PAD and Operations&#13;
    Manual. Project implementation of the cascade based training to all of the union parishads was&#13;
    rolled out through the three local government training institutes and the upazila resource teams.&#13;
                        The UP capacity building chapter of the PAD for the LGSP II is included at Annex 1&#13;
&#13;
19. The majority of the support for the CapDev Framework through this TA has been dedicated to the&#13;
    extension of peer learning on the local government practices identified through the Horizontal&#13;
    Learning Program. Additional technical support through this TA has also been provided to support&#13;
    the National Institute for Local Government (NILG) to develop a national curricula for union&#13;
    parishads (in conjunction with other capacity building providers).&#13;
                       The core curriculum for capacity building of union parishads is included at Annex 1&#13;
&#13;
Scaling-up of the Horizontal Learning Program&#13;
20. This TA has primarily focused on support for peer-to-peer learning through the expansion of the&#13;
    horizontal learning program. This included the garnering of support amongst 32 development&#13;
    partners to assist the central government to scale-up of the horizontal learning program in response&#13;
    to demand from union parishads. The document detailing the proposed approach for the scaling-up&#13;
    of this program included commitments of support from the various partners. This has enabled the&#13;
    horizontal learning program to expand from 383 union parishads in 37 upazilas in FY11 to 660 union&#13;
    parishads in 68 upazilas in FY15 as defined in the partnership agreement document.&#13;
      Scale-up of the Horizontal Learning Program (Nov. 1st, 2011 â&#128;&#147; Oct. 31st, 2015) is included at Annex 2&#13;
&#13;
21. Within the proposed scale-up partnership agreement, this TA has supported the establishment of&#13;
    Horizontal Learning Hubs in the Districts of Chapai Nawabganj, Kurrigram, Moulvi Bazar and the&#13;
    Horizontal Learning Centre in NILG. In these districts, the union parishads and pourashavas were&#13;
    supported to identify a total of 471 good practices with specific ingredients detailed through the&#13;
    drafting of a total of 355 fact sheets. After sharing these good practices with their union parishad&#13;
    and pourashava peers, the annual open budget commitment of union parishads and pourshavas to&#13;
    the replication of good practices learnt from peers increased to USD 7.4 million dollars per year.&#13;
                           A sample of 22 English / Bangla good practice fact sheets is included at Annex 2&#13;
&#13;
22. The exit of World Bank TA support for horizontal learning amongst local government institutions has&#13;
    been necessitated by the expansion of the horizontal learning process well beyond the water and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              14 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;   sanitation sector. The exit strategy is founded on the local implementing agencies that will support&#13;
   the hubs in facilitating peer-to-peer learning processes at the local level. Where this process has&#13;
   been institutionalized, union parishads allocate their own budget to support the exposure visits to&#13;
   gain access to the good practices of their peers. At the central level this is supported by the&#13;
   commitment of GoB and development partners to strengthen the learning orientation of NILG&#13;
   through support for the UP Help Line and the Horizontal Learning Centre.&#13;
         Lessons learned in the Implementation of the horizontal learning program is included at Annex 2&#13;
  The transition plan for the exit of TA support for the horizontal learning program is included at Annex 2&#13;
&#13;
Union Parishad Good Practice Publications&#13;
23. With the support of LGSP, union parishads were empowered to design and implement small scale&#13;
    rural infrastructure projects through local established Scheme Implementation Committees (SICs)&#13;
    and Scheme Supervision Committees (SSCs). This resulted in the small-scale creation of village roads,&#13;
    culverts, drainage and embankments by union parishads through inclusive community groups. In&#13;
    preparation for LGSP II, this TA supported the collation of 102 union parishad experiences to&#13;
    develop a good practice manual on improving rural infrastructure by union parishads, for union&#13;
    parishads. This good practice manual prepared for LGSP II in both Bangla and English includes simple&#13;
    good practice examples, suggested doâ&#128;&#153;s and do notâ&#128;&#153;s and with a particular focus on addressing&#13;
    particular challenges in the implementation of environmental and social safeguards under LGSP.&#13;
            The union parishad handbook on improving rural infrastructure services is included at Annex 3&#13;

Policy / Strategy Informed&#13;
Hard to Reach Areas for Water Supply &amp; Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
24. While access to basic water supply and&#13;
    sanitation infrastructure is almost universal (i.e.&#13;
    98% access to a protected water source and&#13;
    99% use of latrines) there are particular areas&#13;
    of Bangladesh where access to basic water&#13;
    supply and sanitation services is still very low.&#13;
    This is particularly pronounced in specific Hard&#13;
    to Reach Areas that include the chars (i.e.&#13;
    riverine islands), the Barind areas (i.e. the&#13;
    drought prone shallow water table area), the&#13;
    hill tracts (i.e. hilly areas with seasonal water&#13;
    sources), the coastal plains (i.e. subject to saline&#13;
    intrusion), the hoars (i.e. basins flooded for 7&#13;
    months per year) and beels (i.e. localized areas&#13;
    of water logging). In an effort to identify the&#13;
    priority areas for support, this TA aggregated&#13;
    composite impact (i.e. poverty), outcome (i.e.&#13;
    access) and context (i.e. water table / salinity)&#13;
    data to identify the most hard to reach union&#13;
    parishads for water supply and sanitation. This&#13;
    document published by the World Bank was the&#13;
    basis for the formulation of a Government&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              15 | P a g e&#13;

Arsenic Mitigation&#13;
25. In collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, FAO this TA supported a joint United Nations publication on&#13;
    Ensuring an Arsenic Safe Environment in Bangladesh. Bringing together various perspectives on&#13;
    arsenic from source (i.e. water resources) to use (i.e. water used for agriculture and drinking) to&#13;
    impact (i.e. health) enables the fashioning of a multi-sector perspective on arsenic safety. This&#13;
    document alludes to the water safety imperative for the macro-water management shifts of&#13;
    agriculture from ground to surface water and drinking water from shallow to deep aquifers. This&#13;
    also highlights the need for micro-water management shifts to the conjunctive use of water that&#13;
    include the use of deep aquifers for drinking, surface water for cooking, Managed Aquifer Recharge&#13;
    for arsenic dilution, rain water harvesting during the monsoon and shallow aquifers for cleaning.&#13;
    Underlying this is the imperative for improving cross sector coordination through the correlation of&#13;
    data on arsenicosis versus levels of exposure to arsenic through water or food.&#13;
                    Towards an arsenic safe environment in Bangladesh (summary) is included at Annex 5&#13;
&#13;
26. Pay-for-use arsenic testing and marking at the UP level was introduced by the LGD / JICA project&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;Sustainable Arsenic Mitigation under Integrated Local Government System in Jessoreâ&#128;?. This project&#13;
    equipped UPs to conduct arsenic tests with field kits. If the water is safe, citizens receive green&#13;
    receipts and the spout of their hand pump is painted green while unsafe hand pump spouts are&#13;
    painted red. Testers charged 50 taka per test, enabling the UP to purchase the reagent necessary for&#13;
    future tests. UPs mobilized consumers, kept records of test results and reviewed progress in their&#13;
    monthly meetings. Under this project, six different mitigation options were introduced e.g. well&#13;
    switching, deep tube wells (DTW), pond sand filters (PSF), dug well sand filter (DWSF), arsenic iron&#13;
    removal plants (AIRP) and piped water supply (PWS). This was identified as a good practice by union&#13;
    parishads from Chowgacha for replication under the horizontal learning program.&#13;
     The fact sheet on arsenic mitigation options from Chowgacha Upazila, Jessore is included at Annex 5&#13;
           The fact sheet on Arsenic screening from Ranihati UP, ChapaiNawabganj is included at Annex 5&#13;
&#13;
27. The good practice of pay-for-use arsenic&#13;
    testing, marking and switching of wells&#13;
    was subsequently replicated by 51 UPs in&#13;
    8 upazilas resulting in the screening of&#13;
    almost 80,000 sources over a 2 year&#13;
    period. This replication of pay-for-use&#13;
    arsenic screening without the provision of&#13;
    any mitigation option was not well&#13;
    understood by the Horizontal Learning&#13;
    development partners. However with the&#13;
    bringing together of union parishads to&#13;
    explain the ingredients of this good&#13;
    practice they were able to highlight the&#13;
    fact that screening for arsenic allows a&#13;
    â&#128;&#152;no-costâ&#128;&#153; mitigation option. This resulted&#13;
    in the formulation of a policy advocacy&#13;
    note by union parishads identifying&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           16 | P a g e&#13;

    open budget sessions are rare and tax&#13;
    collection by UPs is generally low. Under the&#13;
    Sirajganj Local Governance Development Fund&#13;
    Project (SLGDFP) supported by UNDP/UNCDF&#13;
    from 2001 to 2006, open budget meetings&#13;
    were initiated in 2003. The raising of holding&#13;
    tax was also piloted under this project. These&#13;
    good practices were identified by UPs in&#13;
    Tarash for potential replication through the&#13;
    horizontal learning program.&#13;
      The fact sheet on Holding Open Budgets from&#13;
       Tarash union parishad is included at Annex 6&#13;

29. The conducting of open budget sessions and&#13;
                                                        Union Parishads Process for the Raising of Holding Tax&#13;
    the raising of holding tax have been&#13;
    replicated more than 400 times by union&#13;
    parishads through the horizontal learning&#13;
    program. This led to the hosting of several&#13;
    workshops to analyse the ingredients for success&#13;
    in the replication of these good practices. As a&#13;
    result of the union parishad led analysis it was&#13;
    revealed that the key to success lies in the&#13;
    linking of these two good practices. That is, the&#13;
    linking of the good practice of conducting open&#13;
    budget sessions to the raising of holding tax&#13;
    creates a win-win return for both citizens and&#13;
    local governments. That is, citizens get to&#13;
    influence the total capital works budget of local&#13;
    government while increased own source&#13;
    revenues to local governments gives them&#13;
    greater flexibility to cover some costs. As a&#13;
    result of this virtuous association of open budgets with own source revenues it was decided to&#13;
    adopt â&#128;&#152;holding tax / capitaâ&#128;&#153; as a proxy indicator of the quality of open budget processes. These good&#13;
    practices were also included in the UP Operations Manual for LGSP II.&#13;

&#13;
Ensuring Services for All&#13;
30. The Participatory Rural Development Project 2 (PRDP-2) implemented by JICA and BRDB from 2005-&#13;
    2010 developed the Link Model which sought to improve public service delivery through improved&#13;
    coordination between the UP, Nation Building Department extension workers and citizens. The Link&#13;
    Model comprised of:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            18 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;        ï&#130;·   UCCM (Union Coordination Committee Meeting): to strengthen the accountability of NBDs,&#13;
            NGOs and UPs to the citizens for public service delivery.&#13;
       ï&#130;· GCM (Gram Committee Meeting): is an informal and open forum established by&#13;
            communities to discuss various issues relating to their local village development.&#13;
       ï&#130;· UDO (Union Development Officer): is the member secretary of UCC to establish a linkage&#13;
            between citizens and GO/NGO extension workers.&#13;
    Out of the three components of the link model developed by PRDP-2, the UCCM was identified as a&#13;
    good practice for replication by UPs under the Horizontal Learning Program.&#13;
       The HLP fact sheet on Union Coordination Committee Meetings (UCCM) is attached at Appendix 7&#13;
&#13;
    Under Participatory Rural Development Project 2 (PRDP-2) the UCCM had been initiated in 20 UPs.&#13;
    Since the JICA support for the project ended in May 2010, the practice of UCCM has been replicated&#13;
    by over 212 UPs in 26 upazilas under the horizontal learning program. The experiences of these UPs&#13;
    in the replication of the good practices resulted in the coming together of UPs to identify the key&#13;
    ingredients of the good practice of UCCM. This good practice is strengthening the core role of the&#13;
    union parishad of ensuring services for all (from the demand side) as distinct from the other role of&#13;
    government of providing services to the underserved (from the supply side). The experience of UPs&#13;
    in replicating this good practice contributed to the issuing of a government notification on the&#13;
    institutionalization of UCCM by the Local Government Division and incorporation into in the&#13;
    Operations Manual for LGSP II.&#13;
      The HLP learning note on Union Coordination Committee Meeting (UCCM) is included at Appendix 7&#13;
&#13;
100% Sanitation&#13;
31. The low sanitation coverage in Sreepur Upazila and serious health risk to the livelihood of the poor&#13;
    prompted Plan Bangladesh (in collaboration with Dhaka Ahsania Mission) to initiate a program to&#13;
    eradicate open defecation. The triggering of a movement to achieve 100% sanitation was based on a&#13;
    belief that communities have both the need and the capacity to address their own sanitation&#13;
    challenges. This good practice of ensuring 100% sanitation coverage was identified by Bormi UP in&#13;
    Sreepur for sharing under the horizontal learning Program.&#13;
                             The HLP fact sheet on 100% sanitation from Bormi UP is included at Annex 8&#13;
&#13;
32. Under the horizontal learning program, UPs identified 100% sanitation and eco-friendly villages as&#13;
    good practices. The good practice of 100% sanitation has been replicated by over 500 union&#13;
    parishads through horizontal learning. As a result the lessons learned in the replication of this good&#13;
    practice were shared with government, partners and other unions to identify the key ingredients of&#13;
    success. One of the key ingredients was the switch from the individual promotion of rival and&#13;
    excludable latrines to the generation of a collective movement to â&#128;&#152;eradicate open defecationâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
    Open           Pure     Non-       It is not possible to exclude some people (without excluding&#13;
    Defecation     Public   Excludable others) from the benefits of an open defecation free jurisdiction&#13;
    Free           Good&#13;
    Jurisdiction            Non-Rival    The consumption of an open defecation free jurisdiction by one&#13;
                                         individual does not reduce the potential consumption by others&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Another key ingredient was the leadership of the union parishad, facilitation by the upazila and&#13;
                                                                                              19 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;    political commitment of the government. The success of the union parishad led movement to&#13;
    eradicate open defecation has been so successful that only 1% of the population defecate openly.&#13;
&#13;

Knowledge Deepened&#13;
OpenStreetMap&#13;
33. In Bangladesh, the capacity to populate, maintain and update crowd sourced mapping information&#13;
    has increased through the extension of the public commons licensed openstreetmapping platform.&#13;
    Amidst a growing realization that platforms such as google maps are free to upload GIS data but are&#13;
    not free to download, there has been a growing demand for open source systems that offer greater&#13;
    access to improve and use point source spatial data. Through this TA, the World Bank has been a&#13;
    major promoter of capacity for the extension of the OpenStreetMap community in Bangladesh&#13;
    amongst universities, the water sector (i.e. D-WASA for the mapping LICs) and data managers (i.e.&#13;
    the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics).&#13;
                     Report on the extension of the openstreetmaps in Bangladesh is included at Annex 9&#13;
&#13;
UP Help Line&#13;
34. A two-way system for sharing and collating information from local governments via SMS, robocall&#13;
    and IVRS has been established in Bangladesh. The Union Parishad Help Line operates under a short&#13;
    code (16256) registered to the World Bank by the Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission&#13;
    (BTRC) providing local governments and citizens with a â&#128;&#152;one stopâ&#128;&#153; access to information on local&#13;
    government through all of the telecom operators. This includes access to call-centre operators&#13;
    during business hours, a SMS / robo-call messaging (i.e. notification of block grants transferred into&#13;
    UP accounts), an interactive voice recording system (IVRS) enabling survey information to be&#13;
    collated / mapped country-wide and a searchable data-base of union parishad information (i.e.&#13;
    budgets, mobile numbers, census data). The UPHL is housed in the National Institute for Local&#13;
    Government (NILG) under a MoU with Ministry of Local Government and a small contract with the&#13;
    World Bank (as the operator is empowered to charge fees for some its services).&#13;
                                    Flyer on the Union Parishad Help Line services is included at Annex 10&#13;
&#13;
Water and Sanitation Hackathons&#13;
35. This World Bank TA in collaboration with the Ministry of Information Technology and Access to&#13;
    Information (A2I) in the Prime Ministers Secretariat hosted water supply and sanitation hackathons.&#13;
    These hacking marathons were successful in bringing together computer coders with development&#13;
    professionals to â&#128;&#152;break the codeâ&#128;&#153; of development challenges specifically focusing on the water&#13;
    supply and sanitation sector. This TA resulted in greater knowledge of the water supply and&#13;
    sanitation sector amongst computer software and mobile application coders in Bangladesh. More&#13;
    importantly, these hackathons contributed to a culture of sharing amongst coders and development&#13;
    professionals particularly in regards to the benefits to the global commons of open data principles&#13;
    and public commons licensing for development applications.&#13;
                                    Report on the water and sanitation hackathons is included at Annex 12&#13;

Intermediate Outcomes&#13;
36. The intermediate outcomes from this TA have been defined as those areas where the government&#13;
    and the World Bank jointly share the contribution to certain results. Primarily this relates to the&#13;
    changes in the budget allocations and service delivery practices of local governments that can be&#13;

 Client Capacity Increased&#13;
 38. The Partnership Framework for the capacity development of union parishads establishes an&#13;
     agreement between two government divisions (Rural Development Division and Local Government&#13;
     Division) and eight donors (DANIDA, EU, JICA, SDC, UNCDF, UNDP, USAID and WB) on the capacity&#13;
     building of union parishads. This includes a joint commitment to support:&#13;
      ï&#130;· Supply-driven training for all UPs on core functions (through cascade based mechanisms)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 3&#13;
   Budget allocations to the replication of good practices were collected from published UP budget books and the&#13;
 beneficiaries collated from UPs via UNOs based on the good practice indicators defined by initiating UPs.&#13;
 4&#13;
   By-and-large the replication of good practices by union parishads has contributed to improvements in the&#13;
 reliability, safety, inclusivity and sustainability of water and sanitation accessed by existing beneficiaries as distinct&#13;
 from serving new (i.e. previously unreached) beneficiaries with safe drinking water or hygienic sanitation services.&#13;
                                                                                                            22 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12; ï&#130;· Demand-driven training for UPs on elective functions (through accredited training providers)&#13;
 ï&#130;· Peer learning for UPs to share, replicate and elevate good practices (through horizontal learning)&#13;
via the National Institute for Local Government (NILG), the Rural Development Academy (RDA) and&#13;
the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (BARD).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        23 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;  39. The open budget process promotes citizen engagement in the replication of good practices because&#13;
      it gives the citizens the power to decide how local government funds are used. As the program has&#13;
      scaled-up in FY14 and FY15, the number of UPs allocating their own budgets to good practices learnt&#13;
      from peer UPs has increased (see below), but as a proportion of the total number of UPs this has&#13;
      decreased (due to the rapid scale-up).&#13;
           ï&#130;· 100% sanitation: increased from 346 UPs (97% of 357 UPs) to 473 UPs (72% of 660 UPs).&#13;
           ï&#130;· Safe water supply: increased from 325 UPs (91% of 357 UPs) to 419 UPs (63% of 660 UPs).&#13;
&#13;
Number of Union Parishads Allocating their Budget to Replicate Good Practices of other Union Parishads&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  40. As indicated below, the major allocation of union parishad own budget resources to the replication&#13;
      of good practices occurs in the water and sanitation sector. In FY14, based on the collation of the&#13;
      budget books of 660 UPs in 68 Upazilas:&#13;
          ï&#130;· $1.2 million was allocated by UPs for the replication of sanitation good practices including&#13;
              100% sanitation, eco-friendly village and menstrual hygiene;&#13;
          ï&#130;· $1.83 million was allocated by UPs for the replication of safe water supply, 100% tube-well&#13;
              protection, arsenic screening, piped water supply, arsenic safe options and H/P registration;&#13;
          ï&#130;· $1.02 million was allocated by UPs for the replication of the governance good practices of&#13;
              open budget meetings, UDCCM and union information and service centres;&#13;
          ï&#130;· $2.89 million was allocated by UPs for the replication of other good practices that include&#13;
              tree plantations, disaster relief services, birth and death registration and ensuring quality&#13;
              education.&#13;
                                                                                              24 | P a g e&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 41. This TA has sought to complement LGSP II by improving the access to practical knowledge and good&#13;
     performance incentives of union parishads to improve their budget allocations to service delivery.&#13;
     This represents a practical increase in the capacity of local governments to learn (and teach) the&#13;
     specific ingredients of these good practices and replicate them with their own resources within their&#13;
     own local setting. This includes:&#13;
     ï&#130;· Open budgets: in more than 200 UPs resulting in a 62% increase in holding tax collection in 111&#13;
       UPs that serve 3.36 million people.&#13;
     ï&#130;· 100% sanitation (CLTS, child-to-child 25behavior change, eco-friendly villages) in 126 UPs to&#13;
       improve sanitation for 3.6 million people.&#13;
     ï&#130;· Tube well protection: in 56 UPs improved the bacterial safety of water for 1.6 million people.&#13;
     ï&#130;· Pay-for-use arsenic tests: in 132 UPs improved arsenic safety of 80,000 water sources serving&#13;
       940,000 people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 42. The local government led peer-to-peer learning processes supported by this TA have resulted in a&#13;
     total of 568 UPs allocating USD 11.53 million to replicate more than 25 water, sanitation and&#13;
     governance good practices learned from peers to serve an estimated 9.9 million people.&#13;

43. With withdrawal of World Bank support for developing and testing horizontal accountability&#13;
    processes through the horizontal learning program, the program will continue to be developed by&#13;
    the government with the support of the other development partners associated with this process.&#13;
    The exit strategy for the World Bank has included support to the government and the 32&#13;
    development partners5 to develop a program to expand their support to this union parishad led&#13;
    horizontal learning process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy / Strategy Informed&#13;
44. While access to basic water and sanitation services is high (even for the poorest quintile) there are&#13;
    still areas where access to basic facilities is low. In order to improve the targeting of public and NGO&#13;
    support in lagging areas, the Government of Bangladesh developed a Hard to Reach (HtR) Area&#13;
    Strategy. This Hard to Reach (HtR) Area Strategy for WSS developed by the government was&#13;
    subsequently approved by the National Forum for WSS and published by Local Government Division.&#13;
    This strategy was developed based on the Hard to Reach Areas for Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
    Services Maps and the detailed documentation published by the World Bank under this TA.&#13;

&amp;#12;45. In 2012 the Local Government Division (LGD) and the Rural Development and Cooperatives (RD&amp;C)&#13;
    Division issued a government circular prioritizing the role of UPs in the coordination of local&#13;
    development. This government circular followed the replication of the good practice of UPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    conducting regularly Union Development Coordination Committee Meetings (UDCCM) which was&#13;
    supported by this TA. The UDCCM meetings have now become the standard practice among Local&#13;
    Governments. This government circular empowers the union parishad to coordinate the activities of&#13;
    line departments, NGOs, CBOs and the private sector to reach at least the minimum standard of&#13;
    quality of services. This government circular was revised in 2013 with the UDCCM and then included&#13;
    in the UP operations manual through LGSPII.&#13;
&#13;
46. On one hand, the good practice of raising holding tax has union parishad reliance on citizens to raise&#13;
    untied own source revenues. On the other hand, the good practice of engaging citizens in the&#13;
    allocation of the local government development budget has increased citizen faith in local&#13;
    governments. The linking of open budgets and increased holding tax through the good practice&#13;
    sharing under this TA has contributed to a virtuous cycle between the raising of holding tax&#13;
    revenues and the incorporation of citizen voice in open budget processes. Based on this experience&#13;
    and that of other projects (i.e. LGSP-LIC, UPGP), the Local Government Division has included holding&#13;
    tax / capita in the formula for the release of performance grants under LGSP II. Raising of holding tax&#13;
    and conducting open budgets were also included in the UP Operations Manual for LGSP II.&#13;
&#13;
47. A revision to the Implementation Plan for Arsenic Mitigation (IPAM) was undertaken by the Local&#13;
    Government Division with the goal to separate the 2004 Arsenic Policy from the implementation&#13;
    modalities. This revision of IPAM prioritized the role of union parishads and pourashavas in&#13;
    promoting the testing and marking of tubewells of all public and private tubewells for arsenic. This&#13;
    TA supported the prioritization of arsenic screening as the bottom rung of the mitigation ladder.&#13;
    Through this TA the collective experience of union parishads in the replication of the testing and&#13;
    marking of tubewells for arsenic was collated. This collective experience of union parishads&#13;
    revealing that 100% screening for arsenic is in itself a low cost mitigation option that enables&#13;
    consumers to switch to nearby lower risk water sources.&#13;
&#13;
48. The preparation of LGSP II was supported by an extensive telephone survey of union parishad&#13;
    feedback on their experience of LGSP I. This led to a series of consultation meetings and preparatory&#13;
    workshops with union parishads which was supported by this TA. This extensive consultation&#13;
    process culminated in key recommendations being presented by the union parishads to the Minister&#13;
    of Local Government and World Bank officials during the launch of LGSP II project preparation.&#13;
    Recommendations from the union parishads included enabling up to 10% of the basic block grant to&#13;
    be utilized by union parishads for capacity building / peer learning, the need to publish multi-year&#13;
    block grant allocation projections and the establishment of the Union Parishad Help Line (UPHL) to&#13;
    improve communication with union parishads.&#13;
&#13;
49. The Ministry of Local Government has issued a government circular on the basic components for&#13;
    disable friendly water and sanitation facilities. This government circular on disability inclusive water&#13;
    and sanitation practices supports the implementation of the recent Persons with Disabilities Rights&#13;
    and Protection Act (2013) proposing non-excludable â&#128;&#152;targetsâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;meansâ&#128;&#153; for prioritizing disability&#13;
    inclusive investments. These recommendations focused on findings ways to enabling everyone&#13;
    (including those with disabilities) to participate in the process of selecting the goals of water and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               27 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;    sanitation investments. This circular was based on the sharing, replication and collation of good&#13;
    practices of union parishads in the provision of water supply and sanitation services under this TA.&#13;
&#13;
50. With the 2015 update of the UNICEF / WHO Joint Monitoring Programme identifying less than 1% of&#13;
    the population practicing open defecation, Bangladesh has emerged as a global leader in eradicating&#13;
    open defecation. This is a result of numerous cultural and demographic shifts with potentially the&#13;
    most powerful shift being the union parishad led movement to achieve 100% sanitation status.&#13;
    Although the central, donor and NGO support for the eradication of open defecation has diminished&#13;
    in recent years, union parishads have continued to allocate funds and resources to the replication of&#13;
    100% sanitation practices through the horizontal learning process under this TA. The replication of&#13;
    the 100% sanitation good practices has enabled union parishads toOpen       Data&#13;
                                                                            avoid backPlatform  Visualization&#13;
                                                                                        sliding after the&#13;
    original eradication of open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge Deepened&#13;
51. The establishment and use of the online open data platform for the&#13;
    collation and visualization of various data sets associated with the&#13;
    WASH sector in Bangladesh has been supported by this TA. This Open&#13;
    Data WSS Platform has brought together and uniformly coded various&#13;
    data sets from various development partners and ministries to enable&#13;
    data to be compared. This open data platform hosted by the Ministry&#13;
    of Local Government provides a single point of access for&#13;
    stakeholders to access and visualize, filter and download data from&#13;
    the water and sanitation sector. This forms part of a renewed effort&#13;
    by the Government to develop open source applications to better&#13;
    understand the service delivery chain and the associated risks&#13;
    between the impact, the point of consumption and the levels of&#13;
    access to improved water and sanitation sources.&#13;
&#13;
52. The GoBâ&#128;&#153;s capacity for storing, sharing or searching of GIS data sets has been improved through the&#13;
    use of a use a geospatial data sharing platform. The GEODASH Portal for sharing GIS information&#13;
    hosted in the IT Ministryâ&#128;&#153;s Computer Council enables government, donors, NGOs and students to&#13;
    join the Bangladesh Node to share GIS data. This World Bank TA has supported the establishment of&#13;
    GEODASH which is a bespoke version of GeoNode enabling members to manage their own GIS data&#13;
    sharing options to allocate other users rights to access, download or modify their GIS data. The&#13;
    Bangladesh Node is connected to a searchable data base that enables members globall access to the&#13;
    GIS data hosted on all of the other nodes for storing GIS information globally (http://geonode.org/).&#13;
&#13;
Outcomes&#13;
53. This TA has supported 660 UPs allocate more than $10 million from their own budgets to replicate&#13;
    80 water and sanitation related good practices. Through this process, improved water and sanitation&#13;
    services have reached 9.9 million people in rural Bangladesh. Most replicated water practices are&#13;
    related to the supply and consumption of chemical or bacteria free drinking water and improvement&#13;
    of sanitation facilities. For example: safe coverage of hand pumps or mitigating arsenic in drinking&#13;
    water, using a testing kit and switching wells). In sanitation, 100% open defecation free villages as&#13;
    well as environmentally safe and disaster resilient latrines and support to child-to-child hand-wash&#13;
    behavior change are the most replicated practices.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            28 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;54. This TA has successfully assisted the Government of Bangladesh to plan, launch, pilot and scale up&#13;
    the HLP, which is currently functioning in five HLP hubs.6 The Government is progressively leading&#13;
    the HLP process and plans to form a research division within the National Institute for Local&#13;
    Governance (NILG). Under this TA WSP has also phased out from supporting the program while at&#13;
    the same time supporting the consolidation of learnings from HLP under the National Capacity&#13;
    Development Framework. The support of the project has been transferred to other partners, mainly&#13;
    Swiss Development Cooperation which has signed a funding agreement for the next 7 years.&#13;
&#13;
55. This TA has successfully supported the implementation of by-laws and regulations derived out of the&#13;
    HLP process. This has been coupled with improving communication systems for sharing,&#13;
    disseminating and gathering knowledge which has increased accountability in the water and&#13;
    sanitation sector. More specifically, the program has managed to map access and usage of water&#13;
    and sanitation in the country, improved communication tools for WASAs, and supported the GoB&#13;
    and partners to share their datasets openly, using a data sharing platform as well as developing a&#13;
    water and sanitation data monitoring tool and handing it over to LGD.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
56. While this TA has been successful in strengthening horizontal accountability of central and local&#13;
    governments it has not fully institutionalized peer learning within the local government structure.&#13;
    Although this TA has managed to strengthen NILGâ&#128;&#153;s institutional capacity to facilitate local&#13;
    government led peer learning processes it will continue to require external support. To address this&#13;
    shortcoming this TA has established a cooperation platform between development partners and&#13;
    GoB to continue to support the institutionalization of this process. The risk that the UPs would&#13;
    discontinue replicating good practices after the phase out of this TA has diminished due to the&#13;
    allocation of UPs own funds and resources for peer learning. The World Bank phase out has also&#13;
    been accompanied by other partner organizations (namely Swiss Development Cooperation)&#13;
    committing funds to government and partners to support this process for the next 7 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
57. This TA has made progress in bringing the voice of replicated local good practices to bear on the&#13;
    National Water and Sanitation Policy Framework. However, the time frame of this TA was not&#13;
    sufficient to enable many of the good practices to be refined sufficiently and collated to influence&#13;
    central government policy. The establishment of a process and a mindset through which local&#13;
    practice can influence central policy is however a major achievement. As the technical assistance&#13;
    from the World Bank is not sufficiently flexible to support this ongoing practice-to-policy learning&#13;
    program, technical assistance will continue through the other development partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58. The notion of horizontal accountability through enabling open access to data has gained traction&#13;
    within the water and sanitation sector in Bangladesh. However, while heads of departments and&#13;
    development partners are often willing to release their data for open access, there is still a gap in&#13;
    cooperation between the lower level staff that handles the data and higher level decision makers.&#13;
    This has resulted in a slowing down of the data sharing, which is not yet an institutionalized routine.&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
    An HLP hub is a contact point for the HLP outside Dhaka, and is run by a local NGO. They report to the Horizontal Learning&#13;
    Center located in the National Institute for Local Governance.&#13;
                                                                                                               29 | P a g e&#13;
&amp;#12;   The continuation of the trend of open data access by the government, projects and NGOs will&#13;
   require continued external support to identify the appropriate platforms, develop the tools, clean&#13;
   the data and demonstrate the benefits of enabling open access to public information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59. In summary, although inherently difficult to systematize, this TA has demonstrated that&#13;
    strengthened horizontal accountability to peers for the replication of good practices at the local&#13;
    government level can improve 1) the downward accountability of the local governments to their&#13;
    citizens for service delivery, and 2) the downward accountability of the central government to their&#13;
    local governments to incorporate good practices in policy guidelines.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of this World Bank
            technical assistance has been to support the Government of
            Bangladesh’s (GoB) national capacity development framework
            for improving water and sanitation services (WSS) in
            Bangladesh, focusing on demand-responsive peer-to-peer or
            horizontal learning processes and improve horizontal
            accountability communication and monitoring systems to track
            progress in the sector. This technical assistance is in line
            with the World Bank country assistance strategy (CAS) which
            seeks to support the GoB target of ensuring safe drinking
            water and sanitation for all. It has contributed to
            strengthening the long-term capacity of the government, in
            particular the union Parishad (UP) which is responsible for
            ensuring water and sanitation services for all in Bangladesh.
