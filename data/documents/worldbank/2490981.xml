            Unsolicited proposals : competitive
            solutions for private infrastructure
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This Note looks at systems some
            governments have used to transform unsolicited proposals for
            private infrastructure projects into competitively tendered
            projects. It focuses on the policies that Chile, the
            Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and South Africa have
            adopted for managing such proposals. A companion Note
            explores the problems associated with unsolicited proposals,
            especially the risks they raise for competition and
            transparency. Among private infrastructure projects reaching
            financial closure, the share that originated as unsolicited
            proposals varies across countries. In the Philippines about
            15 percent of such projects have been unsolicited, while in
            the Republic of Korea the share is as high as 50 percent.
            The share is also significant in many other countries, and
            policymakers have begun to recognize the need for formal
            systems to manage these unsolicited proposals. Governments
            could use several approaches to handle unsolicited
            proposals. One option is simply to adopt a law prohibiting
            unsolicited projects-and some governments have done this. A
            second option is for governments to purchase the project
            concept and then award the project through a competitive
            bidding process in which no bidder has a predefined
            advantage. A third option-the one adopted in such countries
            as Chile, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and South
            Africa-is to offer the original proponent a predefined
            advantage in a competitive bidding process. Under this third
            option two main approaches have developed: the bonus system
            and the Swiss challenge system.
