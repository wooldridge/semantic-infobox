&#13;
17-19 July, 2007, Islamabad&#13;
===============================================================&#13;
High-visibility projects influence a range of stakeholders and generally include a&#13;
combination of popular and tough measures. Stakeholders need to be informed of&#13;
proposed changes, have long term benefits explained to them, and be encouraged to&#13;
modify their behavior, expectations, and attitudes accordingly. When governments have&#13;
addressed these issues, projects have been successful. Pro-active and innovative&#13;
communication campaigns, sometimes spearheaded by political leaders, make all the&#13;
difference and led to successful implementation of the project or proposed reform. As&#13;
preparation for the second anniversary of the earthquake in Pakistan, the Earthquake&#13;
Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) requested assistance from the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program-South Asia to build internal communications capacity and&#13;
assist with capturing case studies showing concrete evidence of positive impact.&#13;
&#13;
A workshop aimed at introducing the notion of consultation and two-way communication&#13;
in projects, and to improve skills of staff in designing and delivering strategic messages&#13;
was organized in Islamabad on 17-19 July, 2007 by the Water and Sanitation Program-&#13;
South Asia and the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA)&#13;
with support of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The ERRA program in Pakistan took off the ground in April 2006. Its starting point was&#13;
the rural housing and livelihood cash grants programs; the former is in progress whereas&#13;
the first phase of the later has been completed and the second phase is being launched.&#13;
The Water and Sanitation sector and the social sectors were the next which are moving&#13;
forward with reasonable pace.&#13;
&#13;
ERRA has completed about 18 month of its program by March 2007. In this short time, it&#13;
has undertaken a complex strategic planning and program development process, and&#13;
gained valuable field experience in the implementation. A range of issues have cropped&#13;
up during the planning and implementation phase, and are being addressed during the&#13;
course of work. It seems logical at this stage to document the processes including chain&#13;
of actions and events from the beginning till to date, issues encountered, decisions taken&#13;
and corrections made, for learning and broader sharing. For this purpose, ERRA plans to&#13;
conduct case studies of the Water and Sanitation sector and allied sectors. The case study&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
method is used to conduct in-depth review of the program, project or theme in focus to&#13;
acquire better understanding and knowledge of the same for use in future planning of&#13;
similar programs. It also provides causal and descriptive information and explains and&#13;
explores how certain actions and decisions have impacted the lives of people.&#13;
&#13;
Organized by the by the Water and Sanitation Program-South Asia and ERRA with&#13;
support of the SA-SDU (World Bank), the workshop was aimed at introducing the notion&#13;
of consultation and two-way communication in projects and to improve skills of staff&#13;
(field and centrally-located) in designing and delivering strategic messages. The&#13;
workshop was designed to work at two key levels: first to study and establish the linkage&#13;
between communication support and development effectiveness, and second, to establish&#13;
an enabling environment to develop skills and capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Specific objectives were:&#13;
            To be able to develop communication-related skills such as listening, giving&#13;
presentations, conducting and giving interviews including to the media, dealing with&#13;
communities and other diverse audience;&#13;
            To understand principles of good report/ story writing to start documenting&#13;
the processes used in the earthquake recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation&#13;
            To identify key materials that will be produced for the Earthquake 2005 2nd&#13;
Anniversary and develop plans to produce them.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop was addressed to about 50 participants. These included management and&#13;
staff of ERRA and its field based agencies, SEERA from AJK and PEERA from NWFP.&#13;
Other participants were from WSP and its consultants and World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WORKSHOP&#13;
1. Pre workshop the identified participants were required to fill out an online survey to&#13;
    identify their expectations from the workshop.&#13;
2. 37 participants filled out the survey. The survey took their views/ preferences on the&#13;
    skill building part of the workshop.&#13;
3. For the preparation of case study, a structure was provided to the Program Managers&#13;
    and they were asked to prepare their narratives as per structure, they could add or&#13;
    delete.&#13;
4. Themes per sector too were decided at a VC before the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
The main session of over half a day was devoted to case study presentation by seven&#13;
managers. Not all managed to be result-oriented but the potential for learning and&#13;
garnering lessons was clear in most. WSP will now assist ERRA write out these cases in&#13;
a structured manner.&#13;
&#13;
The other half of the workshop was devoted to imparting skills training to staff on how to&#13;
handle TV interviews, and how to make powerful presentations. It was revealing to learn&#13;
that almost half the staff from the field (managers', engineers or other operational staff)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
was interviewed regularly on TV and by the local print media but only a handful had&#13;
been interviewed or appeared on TV. This training was very successful. On the last day,&#13;
Waqas Hanif. Manager Rural Housing was being interviewed on A-TV and WSP put up&#13;
a large screen in the conference hall and everybody watched it live. What made the&#13;
session an "unplanned learning event" was that the plenary watched the interview in Urdu&#13;
almost as training material, and commented on how Waqas parried well to tough&#13;
questions, when he spoke for too long etc etc&#13;
&#13;
The session on presentation skills and went down well, and participants continued to ask&#13;
many questions on style vs substance even after the session. Session on how to design a&#13;
communication strategy led to numerous questions and during this session the Public&#13;
Information Campaign the Livelihoods Cash Grant program was presented. The&#13;
discussion was lively, almost too lively at times but it bought to the fore the complexity&#13;
of strategic planning required for communications. During the session, participants also&#13;
identified some priority audiences and objectives for the planned media activities of the&#13;
second anniversary.&#13;
&#13;
Participant's Evaluation&#13;
Participants filled in an evaluation form, and also verbally evaluated the learning event.&#13;
Participants appreciated the workshop but felt that more intensive hands-on training is&#13;
required amongst other expressed needs.&#13;
&#13;
Results and Conclusions&#13;
1. The workshop presented two practical cases (the public information campaigns&#13;
    already implemented by the Livelihoods Cash grant program and the rural housing&#13;
    program) of the crucial role strategic communication plays in the success and impact&#13;
    of such programs. These were a good tool and medium to sensitize decision makers&#13;
    about the importance of incorporating communications as a mainstreamed component&#13;
    into their projects and initiatives.&#13;
2. Through the discussions it was presented repeatedly that high-visibility projects&#13;
    influence a range of stakeholders with interests that may be complementary in some&#13;
    cases but conflicting in others: to manage this requires the active cooperation and&#13;
    mobilization of all affected stakeholders in order to be successful.&#13;
3. External communication plan to address all affected stakeholders is not adequate: the&#13;
    institution must display the same commitment towards internal communication with a&#13;
    well defined plan for seeking employee buy-in for program policies or&#13;
    implementation of the project. Employees need to be informed about the program&#13;
    objectives; implications, and be able to modify not just their behavior, expectations,&#13;
    and attitudes but also those of the earthquake affected persons&#13;
4. Refresher communications training of employees is suggested in order to manage&#13;
    messages internally and externally&#13;
5. In his closing remarks, Mr. Altaf M. Saleem, Chairmam, ERRA said that ERRA will&#13;
    seriously consider fast-tracking communications into its operations&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Next Steps&#13;
1. Based on results, conclusions, and feedback gathered from the workshop ERRA to&#13;
   devise strategy to internalize and institutionalize the concept of strategic&#13;
   communication in sector units and their respective projects.&#13;
2. Program managers have a maximum of four weeks (till aug 30th 2007) and are&#13;
   advised to work in teams (add 2 members from the field) to move to narrative stage&#13;
   from presentations of the identified case studies: first cut of narratives to be submitted&#13;
   by Program Mangers by 25th July&#13;
3. ERRA to place material on intranet regularly and get internal feedback: to start early&#13;
   Aug 2007&#13;
4. There should be a technical seminar on what we have achieved with primary and&#13;
   secondary audiences in the workshop. Define the theme of the technical seminar e.g.&#13;
   effectiveness of ERRA Public Information Campaign. It has to be substantiated with&#13;
   information/survey from the field. Knowledge Management Cell to prepare one page&#13;
   proposal for the Deputy Chairman. There could be regional seminars in AJK and&#13;
   NWFP culminating on a consolidated one at Islamabad. ** sometime in end Sept?? as&#13;
   close as possible to anniversary ** Yet to be done/ decided&#13;
5. Second (wrap up) workshop in early Sept: Besides consolidating case studies and&#13;
   communication plan(s), WSP would also like the material prepared to be presented&#13;
   collectively to a roundtable of editors (national and international) for their comments,&#13;
   insight, checking its new worthiness, and further development by their reporters&#13;
6. A tentative workshop schedule:&#13;
Day One:&#13;
Review of Communication Plans and Case Studies (Sept 1/2 day)&#13;
Day Two:&#13;
Skills Training for Core Spokespersons (Sept)&#13;
Background Briefing for Media -- Preview of Anniversary Plans. (working&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Detailed Note on Proceedings&#13;
Day I - Tuesday, July 17th&#13;
1. Opening address: Mr. Altaf M. Saleem, Chairman ERRA&#13;
2. Welcome address: Lt. General Nadeem Ahmed, Deputy Chairman ERRA&#13;
&#13;
Facilitator: Masroor Ahmed, WSP-South Asia&#13;
&#13;
Opening the workshop, the Chairman in his brief address mentioned that we have learnt a&#13;
lot of lessons at ERRA that should be shared so that same mistakes are not being repeated&#13;
with other disaster projects anywhere in the world. He said that whatever ERRA is doing,&#13;
if properly captured, it will save others from going through the hardship we faced. The&#13;
workshop was going to set the tone therefore make full use of it. He appreciated WSP&#13;
and WB for investing time and resources in the activity.&#13;
&#13;
Remarks by the Deputy Chairman&#13;
While welcoming the delegates, the Deputy Chairman placed emphasis on an integrated&#13;
communication strategy for ERRA and in this context appreciated ERRAs Knowledge&#13;
Management Cells initiative in partnership with WSP. He said that there were program&#13;
sector communication strategies and public information campaigns for rural housing and&#13;
cash grants that worked successfully. As other programs are taking off, a more concerted&#13;
effort in collaboration with media is necessary. He pointed out that we keep receiving&#13;
mixed signals from public media as some admire ERRA's work and other criticizes.&#13;
ERRA, he said, should find out where we lack and attempt to bridge the communication&#13;
gaps. He also motivated the Program Managers to share their experiences. He said that a&#13;
lot of knowledge has being generated and tremendous work has already been delivered&#13;
that has to be highlighted. The gap between reality and perception would continue to&#13;
persist if we do not make people aware of our achievements. On the other hand, it is also&#13;
important to receive feedback from people who are the main beneficiaries and users of&#13;
ERRA programs/services.&#13;
&#13;
Introduction:&#13;
The facilitator of the workshop, Moncef Bouhafa and the invited resource person Kirk&#13;
Troy introduced themselves to the participants. Moncef explained the objectives and&#13;
expectations of the three-day workshop as articulated by participants through a pre-&#13;
workshop e-questionnaire which most had filled out and submitted to the facilitators.&#13;
&#13;
Presentation(s):&#13;
    `WATSAN Communication Strategy' by Zaheer Gardezi, Program Manager,&#13;
WATSAN, ERRA&#13;
    Highlights of `Rural Housing Public Information Campaign' by Waqas Hanif,&#13;
Program Manager, Rural Housing, ERRA&#13;
&#13;
Module I: Message Design Laboratory&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Presentation: the facilitator made a presentation on designing "effective messages".&#13;
&#13;
Group work: participants were given a set of guidelines, split into groups, and tasked&#13;
with formulating one or more messages for ERRA, as it related to their work and for&#13;
possible use for upcoming two-year anniversary of the earthquake relief work.&#13;
&#13;
Plenary: Presentation by groups and feedback of participants.&#13;
&#13;
Day II - Wednesday, July 18th&#13;
Recap of previous day's proceedings and outcome by Khadija Khan, Chief of Knowledge&#13;
Management Cell, ERRA.&#13;
&#13;
Module II ­ Case Study Presentation and revision&#13;
Presentation(s):&#13;
    `Environmental Compliance' by Ms Farzana Shah, Program Manager Environment&#13;
    `Social Protection ­ Landless Policy for Rural Population' by Ms Rabya Nizam,&#13;
Consultant, Social Protection&#13;
    `Health' by Dr. Usman Jilani, Program Manager, Health&#13;
    `Assessment and Inspection in Earthquake Affected Areas' by Col. Kamran&#13;
    "Livelihood Support Cash Grants' by Mr Sohail Saeed, Livelihood (Cash Grant)&#13;
    `Rural Housing' by Mr Waqas Hanif , Program Manager, Rural Housing&#13;
&#13;
Feedback: Discussion after each presentation was lively, honest and provided many&#13;
constructive comments.&#13;
&#13;
Generally, participants felt that most of the case studies had not followed the given&#13;
structure/outline and each had followed their own style. It was also felt that linkages with&#13;
other programs (cross linkages) and policies of ERRA were not highlighted. The&#13;
emphasis, it was felt, was more description of the program and not enough on `lessons&#13;
learned', i.e., what worked or did not work. There was vociferous demand for making the&#13;
case studies more "result oriented". Participants also felt that ERRA had done a lot of&#13;
good work which was helped by critique of outside observers. Thus, it was felt that the&#13;
process of development of the individual programs and course correction along the way&#13;
needed to come out more clearly.&#13;
&#13;
The "faculty" consisting of resource persons commented on each presentation consisted&#13;
of Gen. Nadeem who presented an institutional point of view; Kirk Troy who presented&#13;
the journalists point of view; Maheen Zehra who presented a sector professionals point of&#13;
view and also as someone who had little prior knowledge of ERRA's work; Vandana&#13;
Mehra spoke from a communications point of view as did Moncef Bouhafa, who also&#13;
consolidated key comments.&#13;
&#13;
Day III - Thursday, July 19th&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Module II: Case Study Presentation and Revision...cont.&#13;
Presentation(s):&#13;
   `Education' Mr. Chaudhry Liaquat, Programme Manager, DRU Muzaffarabad on&#13;
behalf of Ahsan Ali Mangi, Programme Manager Education Sector ERRA&#13;
   Livelihood (Cash Grant) `Public Information Campaign' by Sohail Saeed&#13;
(Consultant)&#13;
&#13;
Feedback: Both presentations raised a lively, almost heated discussion. Participants felt&#13;
that use of more facts and figures, especially in the education presentation, would have&#13;
made it better. Even better would have been a presentation of a before and after situation.&#13;
Critique was also made of the lack of details about the `software' side of the work.&#13;
Participants also felt that use of a model school as a case study was entirely&#13;
unrepresentative of schooling in the whole Earthquake area.&#13;
&#13;
It was felt that since the PIC campaign was in the process of implementation, nothing&#13;
could be said about its effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Module III: Designing a Communication Strategy&#13;
Module IV: Media Training and Presentation&#13;
Both modules were held simultaneously. Participants were split into two groups, and&#13;
rotated between back to back sessions facilitated by Moncef and Kirk. Moncef made a&#13;
presentation on designing an effective communication strategy, while Kirk spoke about&#13;
giving interviews in the electronic media.&#13;
&#13;
Workshop Evaluation: this exercise was conducted with enthusiasm.&#13;
&#13;
Ranking of Case Studies:&#13;
Participants ranked the case studies for style, content and accuracy. The democratic&#13;
voting process had the right amount of voter rights being exercised with a tinge of cross&#13;
voting and gender bias! The ultimate result was fair and balanced, and results are visible&#13;
in picture attached&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Enthusiastic voters!&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Clear and visible results&#13;
&#13;
Next Steps: Decision and Timetable&#13;
    Program Managers have till Aug 30th to submit their final revised case studies. First&#13;
cut of narratives to be submitted by 25th July, 2007&#13;
    ERRA to place material on Intranet regularly and get internal feedback: Start in&#13;
early Aug, 2007&#13;
    Organize a technical seminar on what has been achieved with primary and secondary&#13;
audiences in the workshop as close as possible to anniversary: Define the theme of the&#13;
technical seminar e.g. effectiveness of ERRA Public Information Campaign. It had to be&#13;
substantiated with information/survey from the field. KMC to prepare one page proposal&#13;
for the Deputy Chairman. There could be regional seminars in AJK and NWFP&#13;
culminating on a consolidated one at Islamabad. Second workshop in early September&#13;
2007. ** Yet to be done. Modalities to be worked out&#13;
    Besides consolidating case studies and communication plan(s) at the concluding&#13;
workshop in early Sept 2007, WSP would also like the material prepared to be presented&#13;
collectively to a roundtable of Editors (national and international) for their comments,&#13;
insight, checking its new worthiness, and further development by their reporters&#13;

            Communications workshop - building skills

            A workshop aimed at introducing the
            notion of consultation and two-way communication in
            projects, and to improve skills of staff in designing and
            delivering strategic messages was organized in Islamabad on
            17-19 July, 2007 by the Water and Sanitation Program-South
            Asia and the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
            Authority (ERRA) with support of the World Bank. The ERRA
            program in Pakistan took off the ground in April 2006. Its
            starting point was the rural housing and livelihood cash
            grants programs; the former is in progress whereas the first
            phase of the later has been completed and the second phase
            is being launched. The water and sanitation sector and the
            social sectors were the next which are moving forward with
            reasonable pace. ERRA has completed about 18 month of its
            program by March 2007. In this short time, it has undertaken
            a complex strategic planning and program development
            process, and gained valuable field experience in the
            implementation. A range of issues have cropped up during the
            planning and implementation phase, and are being addressed
            during the course of work. It seems logical at this stage to
            document the processes including chain of actions and events
            from the beginning till to date, issues encountered,
            decisions taken and corrections made, for learning and
            broader sharing. For this purpose, ERRA plans to conduct
            case studies of the water and sanitation sector and allied sectors.
