            Vietnam - A handwashing behavior change
            journey for the caretakers' program
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Vietnam Handwashing Initiative (HWI)
            was launched in January 2006 by the Ministry of Health (MoH)
            with funds from the Danish Embassy in Vietnam and technical
            assistance from the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). This
            learning note documents the development process of the
            caretakers' program with a focus on how it was
            designed, implemented, and monitored. Lessons learned and
            challenges are also highlighted to assist program managers
            in designing and managing evidence-based handwashing with
            soap or other hygiene promotion programs. A separate
            publication will focus on the process of developing the
            children's handwashing program.
