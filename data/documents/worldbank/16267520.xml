This study was written by Jingjie Chu (Natural Resource Economist, Agriculture and Rural Development Department, World&#13;
Bank), James L. Anderson (Fisheries and Aquaculture Adviser, Agriculture and Rural Development Department, World Bank),&#13;
and Christopher M. Anderson (Associate Professor, University of Washington). James and Christopher developed the proto-&#13;
type method and manual of the Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) sponsored by ALLFISH (Public Private Partnership of&#13;
PROFISH). Jingjie Chu produced the FPIs survey design, completed the manual revision, and managed the implementation.&#13;
This study was built on the results of a survey applying FPIs to blue swimming crab ï¬?sheries in Indonesia and the Philippines&#13;
which was conducted by Dessy Anggraeni (Sustainable Fisheries Partnership) and Jimely Flores (Sustainable Fisheries&#13;
Partnership), respectively. ALLFISH ï¬?nancially supported the survey. Stetson Tinkham (International Coalition of Fisheries&#13;
Associations) and Purbasari (Sari) Surjadi (Sustainable Fisheries Partnership) helped the coordination. Additionally, Finnbogi&#13;
Alfredsson, as a ï¬?shery specialist when working in PROFISH, applied FPIs to the Icelandic lobster ï¬?shery as a comparison&#13;
benchmark.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Currently, the World Bank has about $600 million invested in its ï¬?shery-related portfolio. It is anticipated that the commitment&#13;
to ï¬?sheries and aquaculture will increase considerably in the next few years. However, the task team leaders have been&#13;
struggling to identify an adequate monitoring and evaluation tool. None of the proposed indicators capture the full effective-&#13;
ness of ï¬?shery management, and none help the decision makers understand causal links. Some indicators primarily focus on&#13;
ecological sustainability, such as measuring the status of ï¬?sh stock, while others narrowly focus on the economic aspects,&#13;
such as net economic beneï¬?t or ï¬?shery revenue. Additionally, the cost of collecting detailed biological or economic data can&#13;
be prohibitive or simply not feasible in some developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
There is an urgent need to develop indicators that can measure the success of ï¬?sheries management systems in achieving&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;triple bottom lineâ&#128;? of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The measurement approach should also help&#13;
decision makers understand the linkage between success and management inputs, infrastructure, enforcement, the market-&#13;
ing system, and exogenous factors. Furthermore, the indicators must be relevant, accurate, quantiï¬?able, understandable,&#13;
replicable, comparable between developed and developing regions, and readily available using current expertise and data.&#13;
&#13;
The new Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) aspire to meet these conditions (Anderson and Anderson 2010). The FPIs are&#13;
a new set of indicators for evaluating and comparing the worldâ&#128;&#153;s ï¬?sheries management systems based on their success in&#13;
being ecologically sustainable, socially acceptable, community enriching, and generating sustainable resource rents or proï¬?ts.&#13;
The FPIs fall into two categories. The ï¬?rst category is indicators of outputs that identify and measure key factors that reï¬&#130;ect&#13;
success or failure in achieving the triple bottom line from ï¬?sheries. The second consists of input factors that enable or contrib-&#13;
ute to the process of developing sustainable and wealth-creating ï¬?sheries. FPIs are designed to be clearly deï¬?ned and easy&#13;
to apply for a knowledgeable expert. The FPIs are intended to be completed within days. This rapid assessment approach&#13;
can give a clear picture of the ecological, social, and economic situation associated with the ï¬?sheries management system.&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of this report are to:&#13;
&#13;
   a. Field-test the FPIs as an evaluation tool for the Philippine and Indonesian blue swimming crab ï¬?sheries.&#13;
   b. Compare the results with those for the Icelandic lobster ï¬?shery. This provides an aspirational target for improvement&#13;
      as well as an additional test of the FPIs.&#13;
   c. Evaluate the limitations and strengths in FPIs based on the application above; feedback of the workshop conducted&#13;
      in May 2011; and input from over 30 researchers, government agencies, the private sector, and nongovernmental&#13;
      organizations (NGOs) from around the world. Special attention is given to application in data-poor situations.&#13;
   d. Provide explicit revisions to the FPIs based on (c) as a ï¬?nal step prior to broader application.&#13;
&#13;
The results of the ï¬?eld test indicate that the FPIs represent a useful and powerful tool for ï¬?shery project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The experience indicates that application in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Iceland can be completed in about 2&#13;
weeks at relatively low cost. Despite the ease of application, the quality of the data is high, yielding a good snapshot of the&#13;
biological, economic, and community conditions associated with the corresponding ï¬?shery. Notably, the indicators capture&#13;
key features of success:&#13;
&#13;
      Fish Stock Health and Environmental Performance&#13;
      Harvest Performance Efï¬?ciency&#13;
      Harvest Asset Performance (Vessels, etc.)&#13;

            Conditions Facing Processing Owners and Managers&#13;
            Conditions Facing Processing Workers&#13;
&#13;
       The indicators also capture essential features of the enabling input factors:&#13;
&#13;
            General Environmental Conditions&#13;
            Exogenous Environmental Factors (especially pollution and climate changeâ&#128;&#147;related factors)&#13;
            National Governance Conditions&#13;
            National Economic Conditions&#13;
            Characteristics of Fishing Access Rights&#13;
            Characteristics of Fishing Harvest Rights&#13;
            Participation in Co-Management&#13;
            Management Inputs (e.g., expenditure and enforcement)&#13;
            Data Collection and Analysis&#13;
            Participation by Stakeholders&#13;
            Markets and Market Institutions&#13;
            Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
       Although the application of the FPIs and the feedback from the research workshop in May 2011 was very positive, there were&#13;
       several improvements to the scaling of the indicators and a few omissions that need to be revised for scaled-up application.&#13;
       The suggested revisions in the scaling are identiï¬?ed in the text, and some speciï¬?c recommendation for additions are found&#13;
       in Appendix B.&#13;
&#13;
       Overall, once the revisions have been incorporated the FPIs are ready to be scaled up as a tool for all the ï¬?shery projects in the&#13;
       World Bank, as a management assessment tool or a tool to evaluate investment opportunity. A detailed FPI assessment for&#13;
       each targeted country will assist management decisions for all the target ï¬?shery projects regardless of their implementation&#13;
       status. For projects that are in the planning stage, the output will help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the ï¬?sheries&#13;
       and thus enable the identiï¬?cation of evidence-based policy suggestions. For projects under implementation, the output will&#13;
       help measure their effectiveness in improving ï¬?shery performance.&#13;
&#13;
       The Bank is moving to enhance its activity related to the oceans, and the FPIs will have great value in identifying key target&#13;
       ï¬?sheries and measuring progress. At maturity, the FPIs could be implemented and accessed via a dashboard containing hun-&#13;
       dreds of ï¬?sheries, with data collected at regular intervals to monitor sustainable wealth-creating ï¬?sheries within and across&#13;
       management systems. The idea, logic, and design of the indicators can help develop a broadened set of indicators that can&#13;
       be applied to codependent ï¬?shery-aquaculture and aquaculture management systems.&#13;
&#13;
       Above all, the impact of these indicators is potentially transformative. They will be effective levers to promote change but&#13;
       also suggest what changes should be made to result in sustainable improvement in the ï¬?shery, the economic conditions, and&#13;
       community status.&#13;

Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) make up a multidi-                    Processing and Support Industry Performance&#13;

management system.                                                     All of the indicators are coded in a ï¬?ve-point scale, with the&#13;

            Evaluation of new Fishery Performance
            Indicators (FPIs) : a case study of the blue swimming crab
            fisheries in Indonesia and Philippines
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            To further develop and finalize the
            Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs) for scaling up to the
            Bank's entire fisheries portfolio, a number of specific
            pilots and case studies have been conducted. This report
            provides an overview of the FPIs, and a summary of two case
            studies in its application, the blue swimming crab (BSC)
            fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. A comparative
            analysis with an Icelandic lobster fishery is conducted as a
            benchmark, as the Icelandic lobster fishery is also export
            oriented and has been recognized as a well-managed fishery.
            The study is organized as follows: chapter two provides a
            brief introduction of FPIs and the blue swimming fisheries
            in Indonesia and the Philippines. Chapter three presents the
            results for FPIs that measure the success
            ('outputs') in achieving the 'triple bottom
            line' of environmental, social, and economic
            sustainability and provides a critical evaluation of
            strengths, weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs
            design. Chapter four presents the results for FPIs that
            measure factors ('inputs') that enable (or
            undermine) the likelihood that the triple bottom line will
            be achieved and provides a critical evaluation of strengths,
            weaknesses, and omissions of the current FPIs design chapter
            five summarizes the results and draws conclusions about the
            applicability of FPIs and next steps. Five appendices
            provide supplementary information. Appendix A provides
            detailed explanation of the rationale and measurement for
            each indicator. Appendix B lists additional suggested
            indicators based on the case studies. Appendix C lists the
            participants who have attended the workshops in London and
            Hawaii. Appendixes D and E illustrate the FPIs' output
            and input results for the studied fisheries, respectively.
