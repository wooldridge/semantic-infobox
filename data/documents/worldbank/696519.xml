1. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS&#13;
A. Sector Background&#13;
1.1    Sri Lanka occupies an unusual place in the relationship between education and&#13;
national economic development: its education system is in many ways a heartening success&#13;
story. Although GNP per capita is only US$584, it has a literacy rate of over 90 percent,&#13;
the highest basic and secondary education participation in South Asia, and its social&#13;
indicators are those typical of countries with much higher incomes. However, it now faces&#13;
"second-generation" problems, affecting the quality, equity and efficiency of education.&#13;
Among these problems are the effects of the recruitment from 1989 to 1995 of about&#13;
50,000 mostly untrained teachers, a teacher deployment system that does not make&#13;
teachers available in areas that suffer shortages, a teacher training system that cannot cope&#13;
with the demands placed on it, and the content and nature of the education provided at&#13;
primary and secondary levels. Government has now adopted a national education policy&#13;
to address these issues, and the present project is an important step in supporting&#13;
implementation of that policy.&#13;
1.2    Education Sector: The gross enrollment ratio in primary education is high (101&#13;
percent of age cohort), with net enrollment of over 90 percent, and universal primary&#13;
education is expected to be achieved before the year 2000 (considerably faster than the&#13;
rest of South Asia). Secondary enrollment (grades 6-11)1 in 1993 reached over 70 percent&#13;
of the age cohort, far above South Asia averages. Participation of boys and girls in&#13;
general education is approximately equal--again a sharp difference from the remainder of&#13;
the Region. Most education is provided by the state sector (some administered nationally&#13;
in a few prestigious schools, but the majority at a provincial level); the few licensed private&#13;
sector schools are still officially not permitted to expand nor are new private schools&#13;
accepted.2&#13;
Structure of Education System: The government school system has a structure of 5 years primary,&#13;
3 years lower secondary, 3 years upper secondary and 2 years collegiate. Schools however do not&#13;
follow these levels, but are categorized as follows: Type 1 schools, which mostly provide grades 1-13&#13;
but some grades 6-13 (among Type I schools, Type IAB schools teach all subjects while Type IC&#13;
schools do not teach science subjects at upper levels); type 2 schools have grades 1-11 or 6-1 1; type 3&#13;
schools have grades 1-5. There is constant political pressure to upgrade schools by adding higher&#13;
classes onto a type 1 or type 2 school. Preliminary research by NIE shows a tendency for the best&#13;
achievement in primary education to come from Type IAB or Type 3 schools.&#13;
2   Several "international schools" are tolerated, operating under the Companies Act without clearance&#13;
from the education authorities, mostly teaching in English, and there are many crammers,&#13;
supplementing teaching to help pass examinations.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.3    At the higher education level, on the other hand, Sri Lanka has the lowest&#13;
participation rates in Asia, less than 3 percent of the age group, versus the Asian average&#13;
of 8 percent. Nonetheless, university graduates find difficulty in the labor market, with&#13;
high unemployment among younger graduates. Private sector higher education is&#13;
permitted but is almost non-existent: the least private sector activity in Asia.&#13;
1.4    Gender Issues: Sri Lanka has a unique position among developing countries, in&#13;
reaching equitable female participation in education, apart from the vocational training and&#13;
technical education sub-sector. Almost all girls complete primary education and most&#13;
complete grade 11 (O Level). Female participation at A level and university equals that of&#13;
males. Female enrollments dominate in areas such as humanities, health services and&#13;
teacher education programs. In 1994, women comprised about 80 percent of primary and&#13;
60 percent of secondary school teachers and averaged over 70 percent of teachers at all&#13;
levels. The average age of women teachers is only about 35 years. The problem facing&#13;
the sector is indeed that too few trainees and new teachers are male, which makes teacher&#13;
deployment more difficult. Women are less represented in administration, and continued&#13;
attention is required to increase their opportunities; only 35 percent of school principals&#13;
are women.&#13;
1.5    Education Access/Enrollment: Enrollment in general education increased by&#13;
almost one million (24 percent) during the 1980s. However, during the 1990s declining&#13;
population growth has started to affect education enrollment and population growth rates&#13;
have fallen rapidly in the past 15 years, to about one percent annually. Due to declining&#13;
fertility, first year primary intake has been declining since 1991 by over 3 percent a year&#13;
(Annex 1). Enrollment projections show a continuing decline, especially in the junior&#13;
years. During 1994-2005, the total number of students in primary years is expected to&#13;
decrease by 1 percent per year; numbers in secondary school would decrease during 1997-&#13;
2005 by 1.4 percent per year. Enrollment in collegiate grades (12-13), only 4 percent of&#13;
total students in 1994, is expected to continue growing, but at less than 2 percent per year&#13;
(Figure 1.1).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.6   Education Administration: The state education system is managed by the&#13;
provinces, coordinated by the national Ministry of Education and Higher Education&#13;
(NEHE). The system of decentralized administration has been modified frequently in&#13;
recent years, following changes in national administrative policy. The relative powers of&#13;
MEHE, provinces, district and divisions in administering education overlap. Government&#13;
and IDA are discussing how the system needs to be developed, and administrative reform&#13;
is expected to be part of a future education project.&#13;
1.7   Teachers: Sri Lanka has nearly 190,000 teachers in public sector primary,&#13;
secondary and collegiate schools. A salient feature of the education system is that it&#13;
undertook a net increase of some 50,000 new, mostly unqualified teachers between 1989&#13;
and 1994 as a result of the rapid recruitment with political overtones (following a&#13;
substantial reduction in numbers in 1989 through a poorly-designed public employment&#13;
restructuring scheme). In addition, during that period, matters were further complicated&#13;
by declines in enrollments averaging about 3 percent per annum farther increasing the over&#13;
supply of teachers in favorable areas while deficits remained in rural and difficult areas.&#13;
1.8   Quality and Efirciency: Quality of education is declining, particularly in schools&#13;
in urban slums and rural areas. Factors affecting quality and efficiency include:&#13;
* Expenditures on quality inputs (e.g. teaching materials, school supplies, facilities and&#13;
maintenance) are low and declining.&#13;
* Resources are distributed inequitably among schools--those which serve poorer groups&#13;
typically receive lower allocations of funds and teachers.&#13;
* The unplanned teacher recruitment of 1989-95 raised teacher salary costs to an&#13;
unsustainable level.&#13;
* The deployment of teachers does not respond to demand. Teacher shortages remain&#13;
in rural and slum areas, despite rising surpluses in favorable areas. Some disciplines&#13;
are short of teachers overall, in particular in schools teaching in Tamil, and&#13;
geographical shortages are especially serious in these disciplines.&#13;
* Teacher absenteeism is high.&#13;
* Teacher training has inadequate quality and content and is not cost-effective; pre-&#13;
service teacher education programs have not been reviewed for almost a decade, while&#13;
teacher training institutions are poorly maintained and not located according to&#13;
population and regional needs.&#13;
* The 48 percent untrained teachers in 1994 is gradually being reduced with over 20,000&#13;
being certified, by distance mode, in 1996 and another 15,000 expected to be certified&#13;
in 1997. In spite of these large efforts the present training programs cannot keep pace&#13;
with the needs.&#13;
* Contrary to international trends, overall student:teacher ratios have fallen from about&#13;
28:1 in 1989 to 24:1 in 1995.&#13;
* The teacher training system has inadequate capacity to train so many teachers, relies&#13;
heavily on an in-service distance education program, and has a number of overlapping&#13;
types of training institution whose pedagogical output is inadequate.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Educational administration remains weak and disorganized following almost annual&#13;
structural changes during the last five years.&#13;
* The general education curriculum needs to be more responsive particularly at&#13;
secondary levels.&#13;
* Textbook contents are inadequate, and their poor physical quality result in about 80&#13;
percent of the books being replaced annually rather than every three years as practiced&#13;
by most countries.&#13;
* Allocations for welfare programs take up a higher percentage of educational costs than&#13;
other education systems in the region.&#13;
B. Budgetary Issues&#13;
1.9    Expenditure: Sri Lanka spends relatively little on education (Annex 2) by&#13;
international standards, about 3 percent of GDP and 10 percent of total public expenditure&#13;
(international averages are 5 and 20 percent respectively). Asian countfies average range&#13;
4 to 8 percent of GDP and I 1 to 18 percent of total expenditures. Expenditure has grown&#13;
together with the expansion of the primary and secondary system, and has remained within&#13;
8 and 10 percent of overall public spending since 1982. About 38 percent of recurrent&#13;
public expenditure is on primary education, 53 percent on secondary, and 9 percent on&#13;
university education, although the structure of the school system (page 1) makes&#13;
allocation of expenditures between primary and secondary levels difficult to assess. The&#13;
emphasis on primary and secondary levels, rather than higher education, reflects relative&#13;
enrollment and is reasonable by international standards. Unit costs as a percentage of per&#13;
capita GDP are below other Asian countries.&#13;
1.10  In 1993, 71 percent of the national education budget was allocated to salaries and&#13;
26 percent for student welfare programs (to be addressed in a sector project under&#13;
preparation), leaving less than 3 percent for inputs such as essential teaching materials,&#13;
school supplies and school maintenance. Expenditure per student was the highest for&#13;
salaries (Rs 1,700) followed by student programs (Rs 600), averaged nationally: some&#13;
provinces spent as little as 1 percent of their budget on quality inputs (Figure 1.2).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.11  High Cost of Teacher Recruitment and Budget sustainability: The massive&#13;
recruitment of teachers in the last five years has had an immense effect on salary&#13;
expenditure. Between 1989 and 1993, newly recruited teachers added over Rs 1.2 billion&#13;
(18%) to education sector salary expenditure, which could have been saved if recruitment&#13;
had been confined to replacing attrition and stricter deployment practices applied. Funds&#13;
saved could have been invested, for example, in teacher deployment incentives to fill&#13;
shortages in remote areas, or in desperately needed quality inputs and maintenance. The&#13;
1994 Sector Report indicated that the present teacher recruitment trend would result in&#13;
the doubling of teacher salary expenditures by 2000, and the education budget would&#13;
grow at an unsustainable 7 percent per annum. The Sector Report estimated that if&#13;
teacher recruitment were confined to off-setting attrition, the education budget would still&#13;
need to grow, but only by about 3 percent per year for a few years to improve quality.&#13;
Given the forecast 5 percent annual growth of GDP, that growth is sustainable.&#13;
1.12  High Cost of Recent Salary Increase: A 48 percent teacher salary increase in&#13;
January 1995 removed the salary gap between teachers and other comparable civil&#13;
servants, placing teachers among the better paid public servants. It added Rs 2.8 billion to&#13;
the 1995 sector budget, raising it to Rs 20 billion; teacher salaries are now one fourth of&#13;
the total civil servants' salary bill. It is true that teachers had been underpaid, but an&#13;
occasion was missed to obtain changes in their conditions of service, requiring them to&#13;
work in a manner more responsive to children's' needs. The 2 percent difference between&#13;
the salary scales of trained and untrained teachers may not be an adequate incentive for the&#13;
large group of untrained teachers to take training. Furthermore, as a result of the salary&#13;
increase being given during a difficult fiscal situation, the allowances for teachers serving&#13;
in hardship and difficult areas have been temporarily suspended.&#13;
1.13  Provincial Expenditure on Education: The provinces are responsible for most of&#13;
the actual spending in education from funds they receive as block grants from the Ministry&#13;
of Finance and Planning (MOFP), after they negotiate their budget with the Finance&#13;
Commission (FC). Provinces currently spend almost all their block grants on teacher&#13;
salaries although non-salary spending needs are also included. It is now proposed by the&#13;
MEHE, the Finance Commission, the MOFP and provinces that some funds should be&#13;
targeted for quality inputs. The provinces' current fiscal situation, if continued, will&#13;
further deplete resources for quality inputs unless resources are targeted. Thus, unless&#13;
teacher deployment is rationalized and resulting salaries adjusted, financing for quality&#13;
inputs will remain difficult.&#13;
1.14  The main element in the budget negotiations is the "approved cadre" of teachers&#13;
(number of posts) prepared jointly by the provinces and the MEHE. The preparation of a&#13;
school cadre is based on a school entitlement formula called the "Ready Reckoner" (RR),&#13;
which takes into account the size, type of school and staffing criteria (Annex 3). This&#13;
mechanism has existed for the last fifteen years, but were too generous and had not been&#13;
applied effectively and efficiently since 1989. However, in the light of difficult fiscal&#13;
circumstances Government re-established the use of the RR formula in 1995, increasing&#13;
the links between the teacher cadre and salary allocations to the provinces. The provinces&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
were informed that only salaries for the approved school cadre would be paid. However,&#13;
the process is still largely informal and needs to be formalized under the coordination of&#13;
the MOFP.&#13;
1.15  Inequitable Distribution of Resources Among Schools: The present budgetary&#13;
structure contributes to an inequitable distribution of resources among schools. National&#13;
Schools and the IAB type schools are usually large (kindergarten to grade 13), typically&#13;
located in urban centers and better resourced (budget allocation, equipment, maintenance,&#13;
etc.), and thus can attract more qualified teachers. Type 1C schools (which do not offer&#13;
science programs) receive less resources. Smaller schools (types 2 and 3) which offer&#13;
lower secondary and primary grades, and are often located in rural areas, generally receive&#13;
only one third of the resources allocated to type 1AB schools. The type 2 and 3 schools&#13;
experience the greatest shortages of teachers and receive negligible funds for&#13;
maintenance. Type IAB schools tend to be allowed a more favorable STR; their better&#13;
qualified teachers are typically paid 10 to 15 percent more than those in smaller schools.&#13;
C. Teacher Deployment Issues&#13;
1.16 Mismatch of Teacher Demand and Supply: Although the number of teachers&#13;
in the system has grown rapidly since the late 1980s (between 1989 and 1994 an average&#13;
of 10,000 teachers--7 percent of the teaching force--were recruited each year), massive&#13;
recruitment has not solved the problems of geographical shortages and surpluses, nor the&#13;
mismatch of teachers particularly in mathematics, science and English. Also, there is still&#13;
a marked difference between staffing of schools using Sinhala as a teaching language (STR&#13;
21:1) and Tamil medium schools (STR 29: 1) (Annex 4). In 1994 Sinhala medium schools&#13;
were over-staffed by 10 percent and Tamil medium schools under-staffed by 25 percent: in&#13;
other words there were 14,000 too many Sinhala-speaking teachers and 10,000 too few&#13;
working in Tamil. Action taken by Government in 1996 to appoint a further 5,000&#13;
teachers to the Tamil medium schools reduced the shortage to 12 percent.&#13;
1.17 Declining Teacher Demand: Declining school enrollment and the resulting&#13;
reduced demand for new teachers make the time appropriate to undertake a rationalization&#13;
of teacher numbers and teacher training programs. Teacher recruitment could be&#13;
confined to well below the present attrition rate of 2.8 percent per annum, since fewer&#13;
teachers will be needed in the next few years, at all levels other than collegiate. This is for&#13;
two reasons. First, demographic and enrollment projections show that total enrollment&#13;
will decline by 1 percent per year during 1995-2005. Secondly, student-teacher ratios&#13;
(STR) are currently below international norms. If they were increased over that period&#13;
from the current levels of 24: 1 to 27: 1 for primary, and from 19:1 to 22: 1 for secondary&#13;
and collegiate, demand for teachers would decline by 2% per year. Increasing ratios must&#13;
be combined with measures to ensure that teachers are actually teaching where they are&#13;
needed, because many schools at the moment in fact have large classes, due to inequitable&#13;
allocation of teachers and high absenteeism. Based on the difficulties to obtain political&#13;
commitment to reverse the teacher deployment policies, it was agreed that teacher&#13;
attrition and transfers would become the main mechanisms for the such reduction in STR.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
That approach makes it more realistic, is politically supported and is achievable but will&#13;
result in a lower STR target. However, the most important goal of the project would be&#13;
to reverse the present uneconomical and inequitable teacher deployment approaches.&#13;
1.18  Low Teacher Productivity: The current low productivity of teachers is linked to&#13;
the increasing proportion of untrained teachers, minimal comrnitment to professional&#13;
development for trained teachers, inflexible staffing practices, high teacher absenteeism,&#13;
minimal quality inputs to schools, and inappropriate teacher training. Urgent attention&#13;
needs to be given to: a major effort to train all working teachers, improving and updating&#13;
training programs; staffing patterns, matching teacher employment to needs (matching&#13;
supply and demand); and applying more stringent requirements to teacher work practices,&#13;
reducing teacher absenteeism by various means including relating attendance to pay (the&#13;
IDA-financed General Education Project included a study on reducing absenteeism).&#13;
1.19  Shortages of Trained Teacher Output. Planning for the supply of trained&#13;
teachers has been confounded by massive recruitment, but in any case output of trained&#13;
teachers was less than 20 percent of attrition. The Colleges of Education produce some&#13;
1,000 pre-service trained teachers per year, compared with the 5,000 who leave the&#13;
service. Adding to this dilemma, the inadequate in-service training of teachers is&#13;
detrimental to education quality and is unnecessarily costly. Therefore, increasing pre-&#13;
service output is an urgent national priority.&#13;
1.20  Teacher Deployment Mechanisms: School staff entitlements are based on the&#13;
calculations undertaken by the Ready Reckoner formula. The methodology is sound.&#13;
However, in practice, the approved allocations bear little relationship to actual staffing in&#13;
schools. Major inequities in resource distribution across schools are particularly marked in&#13;
schools in less favorable and remote areas of the country, particularly for specialized&#13;
teachers (including mathematics, language and science teachers). This in turn has&#13;
increased the mismatch between teacher supply and demand with most provinces having&#13;
large teacher shortages or surpluses and only two provinces have an acceptable cadre.&#13;
However, even within these provinces there are major mis-matches between the supply&#13;
and demand in the majority of disciplines or subject areas (Annex 5).&#13;
1.21  Ineffective Teacher Incentive System: Teachers are in principle offered a small&#13;
(10 to 15 percent) allowance on their salaries when they are transferred to hardship areas,&#13;
but these allowances were suspended after the 1995 teacher salary increase. Recently&#13;
introduced transfer and promotion policies include compulsory service in difficult areas for&#13;
new recruits, but the policies are still not adequately responsive to school needs. Without&#13;
an improved teacher incentive scheme it will not be possible to attract teachers to hardship&#13;
areas. There is an urgent need for an effective mechanism for teacher deployment, using&#13;
resources saved by more stringent teacher deployment measures. In addition to&#13;
incentives, difficult management decisions are needed to force teachers who refuse to&#13;
take-up their rural assignments within three months to be dealt with in terms of the current&#13;
Public Service Regulation related to vacation of post (abandonment).&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.22   New System for Staff Transfers: Inflexibility and inequities in staffing have&#13;
occurred because the school cadre is not linked to enrollments and weak staff transfer&#13;
policies. In cooperation with the Education Services Committee the MEHE updated&#13;
teacher transfer policies during 1995. The recently introduced National Teachers Transfer&#13;
Policy (Annex 6) is intended to make the transfer of teachers nationally controlled and&#13;
responsive to school needs. The policy would retain the practice of appointing newly&#13;
trained teachers to areas of greatest need, generally remote areas. It also establishes&#13;
service and promotion requirements which would require teachers to serve in all types of&#13;
schools. Finally, it establishes the possibilities of inter-provincial teacher transfers to&#13;
facilitate transfer from surplus to deficit areas. This policy is sound and the project will&#13;
support its implementation.&#13;
D. Quality Issues in Teacher Education&#13;
1.23   Poor Structure and Organization of Teacher Education: For historical&#13;
reasons, teacher education programs are offered in four different types of institutions--&#13;
Teacher Training Colleges (TTC) offer three year in-service training courses, Colleges of&#13;
Education (COE) three-year pre-service training, the National Institute of Education&#13;
(NIE) provides various schemes including distance education, and four Universities train&#13;
graduate teachers for higher levels. The different institutions operate according to their&#13;
own institutional agendas with little regard to national needs and priorities. Table 1.1&#13;
summarizes staff and enrollment of the types of institution.&#13;

** Includes over 2,500 pan-time staffworking in over 250 study centers throughout the counwiy.&#13;
1.24   The annual output of the training colleges--about 1,000 from pre-service and&#13;
another 1,000 from in-service training colleges--has been approximately one fifth of the&#13;
10,000 teachers recruited annually. The education system has thus had to rely heavily on a&#13;
large distance education program to train teachers after recruitment. The total number of&#13;
trainees in all types of teacher training programs reached 67,000 in 1994, with 80 percent&#13;
of trainees (54,000) being enrolled in the National Institute of Education (NE) programs,&#13;
nearly all of whom followed distance education. Of the 54,000 distance education&#13;
students, about one third are expected to complete certification in 1996. The distance&#13;
approach has not produced fully satisfactory pedagogical results.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.25  Imbalances in Training Programs: Concerns about the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of teacher education have been raised with increasing intensity over the past few&#13;
years; the weakness of the training system contributes directly to the mis-matches&#13;
described above between demand and supply of trained teachers. There is no national&#13;
body coordinating the different types of institutions: the present system lacks national&#13;
perspective. Although NIE has a charter for continuing education, there is no national&#13;
strategy for ensuring the on-going professional development of trained teachers nor the&#13;
monitoring of its successes and failures. There is a plethora of teacher training programs,&#13;
with no common standards or academic awards, and no agreed standards for student&#13;
attainment. Courses vary in length, content is not sufficiently linked to school curriculum&#13;
needs, and the levels and types of qualification awarded differ. In the absence of a&#13;
national policy, there is little relationship or standardization among the programs, and no&#13;
accreditation system. The situation contributes to the mismatch between teacher demand&#13;
and trained teacher supply. The NEC has identified the lack of scope for progression from&#13;
one level of award to another and between institutions as basic weaknesses of the system.&#13;
Lack of coordinated management is reflected in limited planning of teacher training,&#13;
poorly defined policies, uneven staffing, outdated curricula lacking relevance to the&#13;
schools, facilities which have not been designed or planned for adult leamers, and&#13;
insufficient monitoring and evaluation. As a consequence, the overall quality of school&#13;
education is jeopardized and resources are directed to areas of lower priority.&#13;
1.26 Problems facing Training Institutions: The 16 TTCs and 10 COEs are mostly&#13;
small, residential, single and dual discipline institutions, not equitably distributed&#13;
geographically, and not responsive to needs. They have high unit costs. The standard of&#13;
facilities is low, with poor maintenance; equipment falls well short of needs. Data for&#13;
1994 showed serious inequities in staffing with overall student:staff ratios of 9:1 in TTCs&#13;
and 13:1 in COEs, versus international ratio of 20:1. The most serious problems were:&#13;
*  an over-abundance of staff in most TTCs, where enrollments fell by over 50&#13;
percent in 1994 without corresponding reductions in staffing;&#13;
e  the large range of subjects offered in most institutions, all requiring specialized&#13;
subject staff, each working with few trainees, which is not cost effective and&#13;
reduces the needed focus on core subjects;&#13;
*  the inadequate training of the teacher trainers;&#13;
*  the poor physical condition of some training institutions; and&#13;
*  a need to rationalize the 250 small field study centers operated by NiE and the&#13;
Open University supporting distance teacher education trainees, to reduce the&#13;
large numbers of trainees of differing backgrounds assigned to each&#13;
coordinator, to permit joint use by the NIE and university programs, and to&#13;
locate them in areas matching teacher demand.&#13;
1.27   Staff Development for Teacher Educators: Staff of most teacher education&#13;
institutions need to upgrade their academic qualifications (Annex 7). The minimum&#13;
academic requirement for appointment as a teacher educator is a bachelor's degree&#13;
(master's in universities). But in no institution is a teaching certificate required, and only&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about 60 percent of teacher educators have studied the theory and practice of teaching.&#13;
Appointment has been largely on seniority. Over 60 percent of teacher educators are&#13;
more than 45 years of age; most acquired their training years ago and are probably not&#13;
familiar with modem techniques. Fluency in English is not a requirement for teacher&#13;
educators, but lack of English restricts access to current knowledge and publications, and&#13;
limits possibilities for overseas exposure to modem methods.&#13;
1.28   As a group, teacher educators do not have a defined identity, an independent salary&#13;
structure, or a system of incentives. The Government is considering establishing a&#13;
Teacher Educator Service to meet these needs; it would also define criteria for&#13;
appointment. Little opportunity exists for staff to continue professional development:&#13;
opportunities for administrative leadership in particular disciplines are lacking, and there is&#13;
virtually no training for prospective heads of institutions. Other, non-teaching areas&#13;
requiring specialized staff (such as librarians, budget officers, maintenance engineers)&#13;
usually also lack people trained for those functions. Making matters worse, teaching staff&#13;
are not well utilized, with about 50 percent not teaching in their subjects/field of&#13;
specialization. There is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive plan for development&#13;
of teacher education staff, using in-country and overseas training.&#13;
1.29  Inflexible Training Specialization: The majority of secondary teachers are only&#13;
required to be competent in, and to teach, one subject, which leads to inflexibility in use of&#13;
teachers. A further inflexibility arises from the categorization of schools by medium of&#13;
instruction: staff are allocated on the basis of their training and competence in Sinhala or&#13;
Tamil. These policies limit the scope for equitable and responsive distribution of teachers&#13;
across the country and increase salary costs.&#13;
1.30   Unsatisfactory Conditions of Physical Facilities: Teacher training facilities vary&#13;
widely. In general, most are in poor physical condition; only three COEs, NIE, and the&#13;
central campuses of the Open University have good facilities. Three major issues affect&#13;
the physical facilities of teacher education institutions:&#13;
-  Inappropriate location and distribution throughout the country. Nearly&#13;
half of the 25 districts have no teacher education institutions, whereas two&#13;
districts have four or more. The location of institutions hinders trainee access,&#13;
although there are residential facilities. The most populous district (Colombo)&#13;
only has one TTC, but has two of the country's four universities that provide&#13;
teacher education. Four institutions operate in unsuitable rented space.&#13;
*  Inappropriate physical lay-out and poor maintenance. Only three of the&#13;
31 institutions have effectively planned buildings. Almost all lack maintenance,&#13;
requiring major repairs or even replacement (since major renovation is often&#13;
more costly); some buildings should be condemned Furniture, equipment and&#13;
infrastructure need urgent replacement or repair. The institutions do not&#13;
employ permanent maintenance personnel, and the provincial authorities do not&#13;
assign priority to maintenance.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Lack of purpose built facilities for adults. Except in two institutions, little&#13;
regard seems to have been given to the fact that the trainees are adults.&#13;
Residential facilities are unsuitable: dormitories, ablution and toilet areas in&#13;
poor condition, and limited and unsanitary kitchen and eating areas. Very&#13;
meager facilities are provided for private study. No attempt seems to have&#13;
been made to create a pleasant, studious atmosphere for future teachers.&#13;
E. Cost and Efficiency Issues in Teacher Education Programs&#13;
1.31   High Program Costs: After two decades of neglect, inefficiencies in teacher&#13;
education have become institutionalized, and operations costly (detailed cost analysis in&#13;
Annex 8). Teacher education programs cost Rs 206 million in 1994, about 6 percent of&#13;
the MEHE recurrent budget. The full salaries paid to TTC trainees and stipends to COE&#13;
students add substantially to the budget, increasing system costs to Rs 366 million (10&#13;
percent of MEHE budget). Annual expenditure per student in training institutions ranges&#13;
from Rs 55,000 in TTCs to Rs 2,000 in distance education. The differentials are due&#13;
partly to program type, duration and mode of delivery; facilities and laboratories available;&#13;
and the way staff is deployed. Low Student:Staff ratio in the TTCs and the COEs (9:1&#13;
and 13:1 respectively in 1994) inflates the unit cost. However, the high cost of the TTCs&#13;
is mainly due to trainees' salaries, two thirds of their total cost. Disparities in unit cost&#13;
among institutions also reflect weak management. Funding policies for institutions are&#13;
unclear and bear no consistent relationship to enrollments or the number of staff required.&#13;
Management staff lack training in financial and management skills, making it difficult to&#13;
maximize resource allocations. Furthermore, due to the absence of a resource distribution&#13;
formula based on standard criteria, the institutions' annual budgets do not reflect&#13;
requirements: some receive more than others for the same activities.&#13;
1.32  High Cost of Residential Facilities: The provision of residential services to all&#13;
trainees in the COEs and most in the TTCs is very expensive, accounting for half their&#13;
recurrent expenditure. Residential services require numbers of non-academic staff and&#13;
service workers. In 1994, the ratio of non-academic to academic staff was high, at 1:1 in&#13;
the TTCs and 3:1 in the COEs. Costs are further increased by under-utilization of&#13;
residential facilities, 74% of capacity in 1994. As in other Asian countries, Sri Lanka&#13;
needs to develop a plan for relocation of teacher training institutions to increase cost-&#13;
effectiveness, provide boarding according to needs and increase lower-cost day students.&#13;
1.33   Cost Effectiveness and Sustainability of Distance Education: The massive&#13;
number of distance education students gives relatively low in-service training costs.&#13;
Consequently little attention is paid to the cost of repetition and examination outcomes.&#13;
Yet fewer than 80 percent of NIE distance education trainees take the final exam and only&#13;
65 percent of post-graduate trainees complete requirements. Minimum attention is given&#13;
to output cost (cost per qualified teacher), reflecting failure at the terminal examinations,&#13;
number of students not sitting for finals, and attrition from courses. In addition, recent&#13;
school inspections indicate that teachers certified through distance education continue to&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
need content and pedagogy upgrading. Donor agencies financing 78 percent of the&#13;
distance education programs plan to phase out their contributions in the coming few years.&#13;
1.34  Costs of Teacher Education in Universities: The unit cost of university teacher&#13;
education programs is low compared to training in the TTCs and COEs (although financial&#13;
analysis is complicated by the universities' inadequate cost accounting systems). On the&#13;
other hand, costs to students of university programs are far higher than those of other&#13;
teacher training programs. For example, students at the Faculty of Education at Colombo&#13;
University pay Rs 4,200 per year for registration, tuition, exam, and field work fees, which&#13;
represents 7 percent of the annual average salary of the teacher.&#13;
F. Donor Activities in the Education Sector&#13;
1.35  Other Donor Participation in the Sector: Five main donors besides IDA are&#13;
active in Sri Lanka's education sector. (i) SIDA (Sweden) is funding the distance&#13;
education program involving about 54,000 teacher trainees and the construction of some&#13;
plantation schools; (ii) GTZ of Germany is assisting with construction and operation of&#13;
one teacher training institution and upgrading staff, (iii) British ODA and Australian Aid&#13;
are helping with small language training programs--ODA has recently agreed to undertake&#13;
a large program to upgrade English language teaching, starting 1996; and (iv) the Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB) is supporting projects for technical education and secondary&#13;
education--the latter project includes teacher education activities described in Chapters 2&#13;
and 3. ADB has agreed with Government's request to modify that project to conform to&#13;
its new national strategy and revised curriculum structure for initial teacher training&#13;
(Annex 9).&#13;
1.36  IDA Support for Education: An ongoing General Education Project, financed&#13;
by a US$49 million equivalent IDA Credit of 1990 (Cr. 2072-CE), supports access and&#13;
quality in primary and lower secondary education. It supplies educational facilities in rural&#13;
deprived areas, trains principals, strengthens education planning, and supports the&#13;
development of an MIS system. At the mid-term review it was modified to upgrade&#13;
teachers' knowledge of English. The Project has contributed to studies of teacher&#13;
absenteeism, of the links between employment and education, of teacher education, and an&#13;
analysis of higher education. The project was the first operation in the sector and is&#13;
expected to have an important impact on education. The closing date was extended for&#13;
one year and the project is now scheduled to close on December 31, 1996. It was slow to&#13;
start, but from 1994 implementation and disbursements accelerated so that it is expected&#13;
to be fully disbursed by the revised closing date.&#13;
1.37  To increase its knowledge of the sector, the World Bank (with a contribution from&#13;
ADB) worked with Government during 1992-94 on an Education and Training Sector&#13;
Strategy Review to indicate strategies and priority needs for sector development. Among&#13;
that report's conclusions (June 1994) were the needs to switch spending from excess&#13;
teacher numbers and subsidy schemes (such as free school uniforms) to education quality&#13;
expenditure, thus providing wider access to good quality education; to strengthen the&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
teaching service through better-controlled teacher recruitment, deployment, and training;&#13;
to streamline education administration; to pay urgent attention to improving English&#13;
language teaching; to encourage private education; and to make higher education more&#13;
responsive to the needs of the economy and society, with courses relating to skills sought&#13;
by employers. The review was a valuable input into policy discussions, and dissemination&#13;
seminars took place in 1995. Under the IDA-financed General Education project,&#13;
Government prepared a preliminary teacher training action plan in 1993.&#13;
1.38  Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): This project, and the Government strategies&#13;
will support (see below), are fully consistent with the IDA CAS to be reviewed by the&#13;
Executive Directors concurrently with this project, and especially with its fiscal,&#13;
manpower, and social sector aspects. The draft CAS notes the importance in the&#13;
education sector of maintaining the achievements of the education system while matching&#13;
the quantitative successes with quality improvements. The CAS provides for continuing&#13;
to support the Sri Lankan education development program through a two phase process:&#13;
first a teacher training and deployment project to address the most urgent needs, followed&#13;
by a wider education sector operation focused on other aspects of education quality.&#13;
G. Government Policies and Strategy&#13;
1.39  National Education Commission: To identify ways to improve the education&#13;
sector, the Government established a standing National Education Commission (NEC) in&#13;
1992, asking that it prepare a long-term strategy for the sector. The NEC served as a&#13;
focus for Government participation in the Education Sector Strategy Review. It continues&#13;
as the lead institution for reflection on sector policy issues.&#13;
1.40  Government Policies: In August 1995, the NEC prepared a National Education&#13;
Strategy and a Teacher Education Strategy. These strategies, adopted by Government in&#13;
1995 together with a national policy on teacher transfer (Annexes 10 and 5), identify the&#13;
following priorities: (i) increase equity of access and the availability of trained teachers&#13;
particularly in rural areas; (ii) upgrade the quality and quantity of educational materials&#13;
(textbooks and library materials in particular) and increase equitable supply to all the&#13;
schools; (iii) rationalize teacher training and hiring/deployment practices; and (iv) supply&#13;
adequate educational facilities, science laboratories, and libraries particularly in the urban&#13;
slums and rural areas, where shortages are serious; and (v) increase the responsiveness of&#13;
technical and tertiary education to skill shortages. These policies are consistent with the&#13;
recommendations of the Education Sector Strategy Review. They are fiscally sustainable,&#13;
so long as Government strictly controls teacher employment and deployment which would&#13;
allow increased spending on quality-related inputs without significantly increasing the&#13;
education budget. The Government strategy of concentrating first on teacher issues and&#13;
subsequently in a future operation on wider education sector issues are consistent with the&#13;
IDA Country Assistance Strategy. Future IDA support would be contingent on&#13;
Government demonstrating its readiness to make fundamental policy changes.&#13;
Government intends to seek participation of other donors in both the present operation&#13;
and the proposed sector operation.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.41  Future donor support: Government has a two-phase approach in seeking&#13;
support from IDA and other donors. First, it seeks IDA support in implementing its&#13;
national policies in the priority areas of teacher education and teacher deployment, seen as&#13;
requiring the most urgent attention, in this first phase operation. Secondly, it wishes IDA&#13;
support for other reforms, now being analyzed in greater detail, through a sector operation&#13;
in the near future. The sector operation would focus on issues such as the financial&#13;
arrangements between the national and provincial governments; strengthening education&#13;
administration; improvements in curriculum; increasing the responsiveness and cost&#13;
effective supply of textbooks; improving access to quality education facilities based on the&#13;
1995/96 school mapping exercise (focusing primarily on poor rural and slum areas); and&#13;
supporting increased partnership with the private sector (at all levels but particularly in&#13;
higher education). It would assist the rationalization of expenditures, redirecting&#13;
resources to quality and equity inputs, to make education more cost effective. Either the&#13;
sector operation or another might also address the need to increase the coordination,&#13;
responsiveness and type of training opportunities at the post secondary level, both in&#13;
higher education and in skill/technology training. In preparation for the sector operation&#13;
Government is now preparing, with help from international and Sri Lankan consultants&#13;
financed by a Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grant,&#13;
studies of education costs and financing, and of textbook and reading material policy, as&#13;
well as the recommendations of the education facilities survey which identify policies that&#13;
require attention to increase equitable allocation of educational services.&#13;
1.42  Teacher education and deployment sub-sector policy: Since 1994,&#13;
Government policy discussions and dialogue with IDA have focused on teacher education&#13;
and deployment. A number of insightful studies in recent years, financed by the&#13;
Government, by ADB, by the Japanese PHRD Fund and by IDA, have suggested solutions&#13;
to these problems. They were summarized in a joint Government and World Bank report&#13;
"Policies and Strategies for Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment" dated June 22,&#13;
1995 and reflected in the National Education Policy adopted by Government in 1995. The&#13;
dialogue included a series of dissemination workshops. It has achieved significant&#13;
acceptance, among national and provincial authorities, teacher educators and teachers,&#13;
both of the need for reform and of new comprehensive Government policies and strategies&#13;
to introduce these reforms. The recommended national and sector teacher education and&#13;
deployment policies arrived at were confirmed by the Government during appraisal and&#13;
became the basis for formulation of the current project. A policy letter and matrix&#13;
received during negotiations outlines the policies and strategies in teacher education&#13;
(Annex 10).&#13;
H. Lessons Learned&#13;
1.43  The first social sector projects financed by IDA in Sri Lanka, other than a training&#13;
project for the construction sector, are still being implemented, so there are no OED&#13;
reports to draw on. Experience points to: (i) the importance of ensuring ownership of the&#13;
project by a wide range of senior officials, particularly from the provinces; (ii) the&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
advantage of using a sector-wide approach to increase coordination and maximize&#13;
sustainability; (iii) the need to obtain up-front commitments during project preparation&#13;
since policy advances are difficult to obtain during implementation; (iv) the need to pay&#13;
close, continuing attention to the complex bureaucratic and political environment, and to&#13;
ensure participation of different levels of central and decentralized stakeholders to&#13;
recognize their interests in project implementation; (v) the improved implementation&#13;
performance following IDA missions, as Government learned IDA procedures and gave&#13;
positive attention to implementation and monitoring, helping to resolve problems; and&#13;
(vii) the need in project design to draw not only on previous experience in Sri Lanka but&#13;
on lessons from projects in other countries. This experience and OED analyses confirm&#13;
the importance of strengthening teacher training as a means of improving the quality of&#13;
education. Similarly, demand-based criteria for teacher allocation have been shown to be&#13;
the most equitable and cost-effective way to staff an education system.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE PROJECT: CONCEPT, COMPOSITION AND&#13;
CONTEXT&#13;
A. Project Objectives, Concept and Description&#13;
2.1   The Project is designed to implement the Government's teacher education and&#13;
deployment strategies described in Chapter 1. It constitutes the first phase in a series of&#13;
actions to strengthen the education sector that Government hopes will be supported by&#13;
donors in the next few years. The project has two key areas: The first, involves the&#13;
rationalization of teacher numbers and their deployment; the second includes the&#13;
strengthening and rationalization of teacher education programs, institutions, staff and&#13;
management to enable Government to meet the demand and supply of teachers while&#13;
improving quality and cost-effectiveness of teacher education. Project objectives, based&#13;
on policy initiatives agreed between the Government and IDA over the past year, are to&#13;
improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and coverage of education in Sri Lanka, by:&#13;
*  improving education attainment and equity, by having better-trained&#13;
teachers widely available in schools--particularly in disadvantaged schools--so&#13;
improving teaching/learning, reducing repetition and drop-out rates, and thus&#13;
both reducing the cost of the education cycle and making the system more&#13;
equitable;&#13;
*  making the system more efficient by rationalizing teacher recruitment,&#13;
deployment, and training policies, making them demand driven to provide&#13;
effective and equitable allocation of teachers to address national, district, and&#13;
school level needs, and to reduce salary costs;&#13;
3  making more effective use of education expenditure through rationalizing&#13;
teacher numbers and their deployment, thus reducing total salary costs and&#13;
freeing funds for quality expenditures;&#13;
*  improving the quality of teacher education by measures to improve the&#13;
coordination, quality and certification policies of teacher education, and&#13;
improving teacher training programs to increase responsiveness, reduce&#13;
duplication, and improve quality and cost-effectiveness;&#13;
*  making the teacher training system more cost-effective through&#13;
rationalizing the number and geographical distribution of teacher training&#13;
institutions, maximizing their utilization, and making the institutions multi-&#13;
functional, upgrading the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of teacher&#13;
trainers/educators and strengthening management capacity in teacher training&#13;
institutions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
2.2   During the last two years the MEHE, supported by IDA and other donors, has&#13;
undertaken a participatory process to seek agreement of stakeholders for improvements in&#13;
teacher education and teacher deployment policies. Important policy agreements on the&#13;
coordination and structure of teacher education programs and the need to rationalize the&#13;
number and type of teacher education institutions were reached, and national teacher&#13;
education and deployment policy programs agreed. An important part of the strategy is to&#13;
re-shape the teacher supply and demand formula used by the national and provincial&#13;
authorities to allocate teachers and funds for teacher salaries among the provinces.&#13;
Discussions on the strategy have been held among education policy-makers,&#13;
administrators, and teacher and union representatives; there seems to be wide acceptance&#13;
of the program. Policy agreements reached during appraisal were confirmed during&#13;
negotiations and are outlined in policy letter and matrix in Annex 10.&#13;
2.3    Description: Project Components are described in detail in Annex 11 and their&#13;
expected outcome, costs and benefits in Annex 12. The project would improve education&#13;
quality, equity and cost-effectiveness of the education system through programs and&#13;
policies as follows:&#13;
(a)   Rationalization of teacher deployment by: (i) adjusting the present&#13;
Government formula [called the "Ready Reckoner" (RR)] used for staff&#13;
recruitment and allocation, to allocate teachers equitably according to school&#13;
needs; (ii) monitoring teacher allocations and linking them to budget allocations;&#13;
(iii) measures, including incentives, to facilitate teacher assignment in less&#13;
favorable areas; and (iv) moving to a fully-trained teacher force, by training&#13;
existing teachers and recruiting only trained teachers. This rationalization would&#13;
improve the equity and cost-effectiveness of teacher recruitment and deployment&#13;
practices (leading to redeployment of about 4,000 teachers p.a., with those&#13;
teachers who do not accept redeployment being treated according to the current&#13;
Public Service Regulations of vacation of post) through demand and supply&#13;
mechanisms directly linked to budgetary allocations. The Credit would finance&#13;
technical assistance. (Estimated baseline cost US$0.2 million.)&#13;
(b)   Rationalization of structure and organization of teacher education&#13;
through (i) establishing a National Authority on Teacher Education (NATE), to&#13;
plan, coordinate and upgrade teacher-education programs; (ii) strengthening the&#13;
office of the Commissioner of Teacher Education (in MEHE); and (iii)&#13;
rationalizing teacher training institutions into three types--Universities, NIE, and&#13;
14 National Colleges of Education (NCOEs), together with Teacher Centers (TCs)&#13;
for teacher upgrading, while distributing teacher training resources more equitably&#13;
among regions. The project would finance books, materials and equipment,&#13;
together with technical assistance, and operating costs for NATE on a declining&#13;
basis. (Estimated baseline cost US$0.8 million).&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)   Upgrading of teacher education programs. Training programs (for pre-&#13;
service and for both direct and distance mode in-service training) will be upgraded,&#13;
including revising curricula, updating teacher materials (in cooperation with the&#13;
ADB and SIDA), consolidating programs, and increasing the content relationship&#13;
between the school and teacher education curricula. The courses would be&#13;
redesigned by NIE, based upon on-going needs assessments of teachers. The&#13;
Project would provide equipment, books and materials, technical assistance and&#13;
training. (Estimated baseline cost US$3.7 million).&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of staff and management. Staffing and enrollment&#13;
patterns would be rationalized to increase student:staff ratios to 15:1. Teacher&#13;
educators and administrators would be trained, improving quality through&#13;
upgrading staff qualifications and skills (in cooperation with ADB and other&#13;
donors). The component would support continuing education for 170, 000&#13;
teachers, partly financed by SIDA. As well as training, the project would provide&#13;
technical assistance. (Estimated baseline cost US$11.2 million.)&#13;
(e)   Strengthening and upgrading of the teacher training institutions. The&#13;
institutions offering teacher education would be reduced in number [from 31 to 19,&#13;
including 14 NCOEs (of which 5 would be new institutions and 9 at existing&#13;
institutions), the NIE, 4 Universities and about 80 TCs], and distributed equitably,&#13;
to increase cost effectiveness and double the present pre-service output at the&#13;
NCOEs to about 3025 and to 750 at the university level. Project inputs include&#13;
rehabilitation and extension of 9 existing institutions, construction and equipping&#13;
of 5 new NCOEs, and development of about 80 TCs for teacher upgrading&#13;
programs. Buildings for most TCs already exist. These inputs are being&#13;
coordinated with ADB, which is financing rehabilitation of training institutions.&#13;
The component would allow Government to provide cost-effective, quality pre-&#13;
service and in-service teacher education for primary and secondary teachers: for&#13;
about 14,000 trainees in full time programs and 20,000 trainees in part-time&#13;
programs annually. Thus, over five years about 186,000 teachers would be trained&#13;
or upgraded with 16,000 participating in full-time pre-service programs and about&#13;
170,000 teachers being upgraded through continuing education programs&#13;
improving the quality of education for 4 million students. The component would&#13;
mainly provide civil works, furniture and equipment. (Estimated baseline cost&#13;
US$46.8 million.)&#13;
(f)    Strengthening management of teacher training institutions&#13;
by upgrading skills of academic and management staff, at the NCOEs, university&#13;
education faculties, NIE, the TCs, the Office of the Chief Commissioner for&#13;
Teacher Education (MEHE) and the NATE, through training and technical&#13;
assistance. (Estimated baseline cost US$0.6 million.)&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(g)   Studies and monitoring, strengthening MERE capacity to monitor the&#13;
education system; and preparing for future sector projects. (Estimated baseline&#13;
cost US$0.3 million.)&#13;
(h)   Project Coordination. Support for project coordination and monitoring&#13;
unit and support for NATE. (Estimated baseline cost US$1.3 million.)&#13;
2.4   Phasing: Implementation of components would be divided into two phases, with&#13;
the investments that are included in the second phase being started after the Government&#13;
has shown at the mid-term review attainment of a number of benchmarks. The&#13;
benchmarks relate to the Cadre Committee functioning, compliance with the provisions of&#13;
the RR and an increase in the STR to 26:1 at primary and 22:1 at secondary, the transfer&#13;
policy being implemented, the rationalization of the teacher education system, the&#13;
earmarking of savings for quality inputs, and progress on physical implementation. These&#13;
benchmarks have been agreed with Government.&#13;
2.5   Component A: Rationalization of Teacher Deployment: Teacher recruitment&#13;
and deployment mechanisms would be modified to improve response to demand while&#13;
increasing equity and quality of education, as well as reducing teacher costs. This policy&#13;
based component would reactivate and update the teacher allocation mechanism (the RR),&#13;
and formalize efforts to standardize the teacher cadre and link it to budgetary allocations.&#13;
The revised RR formula takes into consideration actual teacher needs based on student&#13;
enrollments, the existing teacher cadre, and the annual loss of teachers from the system&#13;
(due to retirement, death, departure etc.), in allocation of teachers at the primary and&#13;
secondary levels. Use of the formula and associated mechanisms (including the revised&#13;
transfer policy, below) would allocate a specific cadre of teachers to each school and&#13;
province and, in turn, trigger annual budgetary allocations to be determined by a new&#13;
Cadre Committee (see below) and used by the Ministry of Finance in allocating block&#13;
grants to the provinces (throughi the Finance Commission). Control over budgetary&#13;
allocations is the main tool by which the central administration can ensure that provinces&#13;
follow the RR and transfer provisions. The agreed program provides that within three to&#13;
five years the number of teachers should be rationalized; by the end of the project only&#13;
trained teachers would enter the system and most existing teachers would have been&#13;
trained. Teachers who do not accept redeployment would be treated as having vacated&#13;
their post.&#13;
2.6   The component would: (i) control teacher recruitment to meet attrition and apply&#13;
the modified RR to achieve STR targets of 26:1 for primary and 22:1 for secondary by&#13;
year 2001 (see Annex 3 for details on the application of the RR); (ii) apply the RR&#13;
consistently to all schools (with stringent provisions for variations to cater for exceptional&#13;
circumstances); (iii) relate teacher demand projection analysis to teacher supply with&#13;
annual adjustments; (iv) link the cadre entitlement for each province to the budget&#13;
allocation for salaries; (v) target 3 percent of the provincial recurrent block grant,&#13;
starting 1997 and reaching 6 percent in 2000 for quality inputs, particularly in&#13;
disadvantaged areas; (vi) require all teachers entering the service to have successfully&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
completed an accredited teacher education program (with untrained teachers only being&#13;
appointed, following the application of the RR, to meet staffing emergencies). During&#13;
negotiations the Government gave assurances that MEHE and provincial authorities shall:&#13;
gradually increase the overall the student:teacher ratio so as to ensure that by January 1,&#13;
2001 the said ratio has reached 26:1 for primary schools and 22:1 for secondary school&#13;
[para. 5.1 (a)].&#13;
2.7    The agreed policy letter also provides that Government would implement recent&#13;
initiatives for the rationalization of teacher deployment measures by: (i) consolidation of&#13;
smaller primary schools; (ii) training all primary teacher to teach English allowing the&#13;
phasing-out English specialist at the primary level; (iii) eliminating the non-teaching&#13;
positions of principals in schools with less than 5 teachers; (iv) consolidating secondary A&#13;
level classes with 15 or less students in any stream; (v) undertaking special recruitment of&#13;
Tamil medium teachers on a contract basis on condition of performance after the required&#13;
professional training at the end of 5 years; (vi) undertaking special recruitment of&#13;
university graduates according to identified subject specialist shortages; (vii) introducing a&#13;
post-graduate diploma in education as an initial training course for an identified number of&#13;
graduates annually prior to their employment as teachers. These measures would release&#13;
6,850 teaching and administrative positions and will accelerate the attrition and, over the&#13;
next 8 to 10 years, reduce the teaching force by about 25,000 positions (Annex 3). These&#13;
consolidation goals would be part of the mid-tern review benchmarks (para. 3.28).&#13;
2.8   The project would strengthen MEHE's capacity to: (i) collect and analyze data on&#13;
teacher needs, and make demand projections; (ii) link needs to supply capacity; and (iii)&#13;
regulate the annual teacher trainee intake and deployment of trained teachers. Salary&#13;
savings resulting from using the RR would be reallocated to teacher incentives, quality&#13;
inputs and maintenance. The goal would be to increase the present national average&#13;
allocation of 3 percent for quality inputs (it is as low as 1 percent in some provinces) by&#13;
about 1 percent per year reaching a minimum of 6 percent by the end of the project.&#13;
During negotiation Government gave assurances that it would: earmark, on or about&#13;
January 1, 1997: (i) 3 percent of the annual recurrent block grant budget allocation in each&#13;
province for quality inputs (such as textbooks, audiovisual equipment and educational&#13;
materials), and thereafter increase such percentage at the rate of 1 percent per annum so as&#13;
to reach 6 percent for each province by January 1, 2001; and (ii) I percent of the&#13;
education capital budget allocation to each province for maintenance of schools (para.&#13;
2.29). The Borrower shall evaluate this percentage during FY 97 and FY 98 to: (a)&#13;
determine, in consultation with the Association, actual maintenance needs; and (b)&#13;
prepare, based on such evaluation, a long-term maintenance plan for educational facilities,&#13;
satisfactory to the Association [Para. 5.1 (b)].&#13;
2.9   The approved cadre would be determined annually by a Teacher Cadre Commnittee&#13;
(TCC --Annex 13) membership would comprise: (i) the Additional Secretary&#13;
(Administration), Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) chair; (ii) a&#13;
representative of the National Authority for Teacher Education; (iii) two Provincial&#13;
Directors of Education (Rotate in every three years); (iv) a representative of the Secretary&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to the Ministry of Provincial Councils; (v) two representatives of the Secretary to the&#13;
Ministry of Finance one of whom shall be from the Planning Division and the other from&#13;
the Budget Division; (vi) Director of Policy, Planning and Review Division, Ministry of&#13;
Education; (vii) Chairman/Secretary of Education Service Committee; (viii) Chief&#13;
Commissioner of the Colleges of Education; and (ix) Representative of the Finance&#13;
Commission. Following the cadre determination the MOFP and the Finance Commission&#13;
would ensure that the budgetary and salary allocations to each province would match the&#13;
RR. When submitting the next year's cadre needs, the provinces would account for the&#13;
use of the previous year's RR allocation. During negotiations the Government gave&#13;
assurances that it would: (a) establish, by November 1, 1996 or such later date as the&#13;
Association shall agree: (i) a Teacher Cadre Committee to overview the cadre allocation&#13;
and implementation of the RR; and (ii) National Authority on Teacher Education (NATE)&#13;
(para 2.14), both with membership, powers and responsibilities satisfactory to the&#13;
Association; and (b) thereafter maintain and operate the Cadre Committee and NATE&#13;
[para. 5.1 (c)].&#13;
2.10  During negotiations the Government gave assurances that it would: undertake&#13;
commencing January 1, 1997 to: (a) recruit and assign teachers only in accordance with&#13;
the revised Ready Reckoner formula and Teacher Cadre Committee allocations directly&#13;
linked to the annual budget and that special or emergency appointments of teachers will&#13;
only follow the application of the said formula; and (b) the application of the Ready&#13;
Reckoner formula will be monitored annually by the Government and any deviation&#13;
therefrom promptly corrected and notice thereof given to the Association [para.. 1 (d)].&#13;
2.11   Provinces which are over-staffed and do not meet the agreed staff equalization&#13;
plan would not be allowed to use funds from other budget heads to pay salaries; they&#13;
would have to conform to the student unit cost allocations for non-salary inputs being&#13;
developed by MEHE. Provinces which are understaffed and unable to attract staff would,&#13;
following development of a suitable support and incentive plan for targeted schools, be&#13;
allocated additional funds. As part of the teacher monitoring provisions, the provinces&#13;
would, in consultation with the ESC, develop during the first year of the project measures&#13;
to track teacher absenteeism. Teachers who continued to take non-approved or&#13;
authorized leave would have their remuneration reviewed. Provinces could then utilize&#13;
unpaid funds to pay the costs of substitute teachers, being aware that no supplementary&#13;
salary allocations would be made for teachers with excessive absenteeism.&#13;
2.12  Transfer Boards, created under the 1995 National Policy on Teacher Transfers,&#13;
would have a critical role in redistribution of staff to achieve greater equity (Annex 6).&#13;
Strict application of requirements for initial appointment to "non-congenial" schools (for a&#13;
minimum of 4 years) and to "difficult" schools (for a minimum of 3 years) and for transfer&#13;
of teachers after serving a maximum of 8 years in a "congenial" and 6 years in a "very&#13;
congenial" school, would be essential. MEHE would be responsible for designing a plan&#13;
to attract teachers to, and to support teachers in, less favorable areas. This plan would be&#13;
funded from the savings on teacher salaries, from applying the revised RR. It would, for&#13;
example, provide differential allowances (incentives) based on the degree of hardships and&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
years of service in a less favorable location; together with support for teacher travel and&#13;
housing, special provision to facilitate teacher access to study opportunities, and education&#13;
of the teacher's children. However, teachers who were not ready to be transferred from&#13;
surplus to deficit areas in accordance with the new policy would be deemed to have&#13;
vacated (abandoned) their post; provinces would not have the funds to pay salaries of&#13;
teachers above the approved cadre, and would therefore have an incentive to apply this&#13;
provision. During negotiations the Government agreed that it will no later than January 1,&#13;
1998, commence the application of a teacher support and incentives system satisfactory to&#13;
the Association to facilitate teacher assignments in less favorable areas through the&#13;
Teacher Transfer Boards [Section 5, para. 5.1 (e )]. As a further measure to facilitate&#13;
equitable and flexible deployment, the initial teacher appointment will be to hardship areas&#13;
("non-congenial" and "difficult" schools) and future teacher promotions will depend on&#13;
their having served a mimimum of three years in these types of schools/areas. For the&#13;
above activities, the project would support 57 person months of technical assistance&#13;
outlined in Annex 14. Terms of reference for each consultant are included in the&#13;
Implementation Volume.&#13;
2.13   Component B: Rationalization of Structure and Organization: The proposed&#13;
structure of the reformed teacher education covering all institutions involved in training&#13;
teachers, is outlined in Annex 15. The system, evenly distributed across the provinces,&#13;
would consist of the coordinating body -- NATE, and three types of training institutions&#13;
offering initial and continuing teacher education by direct and distance mode -- 4&#13;
Universities, NIE and 14 National Colleges of Education (NCOEs) -- supported by 84&#13;
TCs [about 81 Type A and 3 Type B which are in the process of being renamed Teacher&#13;
Education Institutions (TEIs)]. The restructuring would: (i) provide the framework for&#13;
coordinating all aspects of teacher education on a national basis, including the linking of&#13;
teacher demand with supply through the training institutions; (ii) provide sufficient initial&#13;
training places to meet national needs for trained teachers; (iii) concentrate initial teacher&#13;
education in larger and more economical institutions, centrally located in the main&#13;
population centers, thereby increasing the proportion of students in non-residential places;&#13;
(iv) progressively transform distance mode teacher training from initial certificate to&#13;
diploma and graduate diploma courses, and to continuing education; (v) achieve a better&#13;
coverage of staff expertise in areas of specialization within each institution; and (vi)&#13;
establish and safeguard standards for teacher education programs through a national&#13;
accreditation and monitoring mechanism. Government has formally endorsed this&#13;
program, including the integration in the national teacher education system of NIE and&#13;
the faculties of education of the universities that train teachers (Colombo, Peradeniya,&#13;
Jaffna and Open University). The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Teacher&#13;
Education in MIEHE would be given a clearer mandate and be strengthened with&#13;
additional staff and equipment.&#13;
2.14  During negotiations the Goverment gave assurances that it would establish and&#13;
staff NATE by November 1, 1996 [ para. 5.1 (c)]. NATE would be a semi-autonomous&#13;
body responsible to the Minister for Education and Higher Education, and funded as a&#13;
separate entity. Its membership and functions are outlined in (Annex 16). It would advise&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
education; facilitate implementation of the integrated system; do monitoring and research;&#13;
and provide public information on teacher education. NATE would have a key role in&#13;
regulating the supply of trained teachers to meet projected demand in schools, making&#13;
annual recommendations on student intake to the Minister, MEHE. It would advise on&#13;
budget requirements for each teacher education institution, based on student enrollment&#13;
and unit costs. All teacher education programs would be subject to accreditation through&#13;
NATE. NATE would coordinate development of a comprehensive continuing education&#13;
plan; and undertake subject-based needs assessments to help design courses for teacher&#13;
educators. The project would support NATE's incremental recurrent budget on a&#13;
declining basis. Technical assistance support for NATE and the Commissioner of Teacher&#13;
Education totaling 46 person months is outlined in Annex 14.&#13;
2.15  The 14 NCOEs would be national institutions, under the overall responsibility of&#13;
the MEHE, with a principal focus on initial training to diploma level and on short&#13;
continuing teacher education courses. NCOEs would normally offer 3 to 4 disciplines for&#13;
an enrollment of around 700-1,000 students (including 300 third year students in their&#13;
internship year in schools), with a physical capacity of 500-800, and provision for&#13;
residential and non-residential students. Each NCOE would have within its organizational&#13;
structure a number of TCs, assigned according to location and other strategic factors. The&#13;
executive structure of the NCOEs is shown in Annex 17.&#13;
2.16  The TCs would serve as (i) centers for continuing education courses (half day to&#13;
three weeks); (ii) resource bases for teachers; (iii) learning and administrative outlets for&#13;
distance teacher education activities run by universities and NIE; (iv) bases for advisors&#13;
working with teachers in local schools, where appropriate; and (iv) centers for English&#13;
language teaching for teachers, if required. The about 80 TCs Type A would have a&#13;
capacity for about 100 non-residential teachers at one time, catering to teachers who can&#13;
attend on a daily basis (week days and week-ends). The three Type B TCs /TIEs would&#13;
day programs, but also have residential facilities for teachers without reasonable access to&#13;
Type A TCs. NCOEs would receive funding for the full operation of the assigned TCs&#13;
and TEIs as a specific item within their annual budget. Most TCs and TEIs would employ&#13;
a fili time principal and about three lecturers. The location of the proposed TCs and TEIs&#13;
is provided in Annex 18.&#13;
2.17  The Faculties/Departments of Education at the universities would provide initial&#13;
teacher education both in subjects taught in schools and in educational methodology,&#13;
through either a first integrated degree (B.Ed.) or post graduate diploma (Dip.Ed.)&#13;
programs. Some universities would continue to give doctorate programs in education.&#13;
The faculties would operate under their institutions' academic structures. In order to&#13;
receive funding for teacher education programs, the universities would have to participate&#13;
in the integrated national system. In particular, this would involve allocation of teacher&#13;
trainee places consistent with national needs; selection of students based on agreed&#13;
minimal criteria; agreed student:teacher ratios; and the accreditation of courses by NATE.&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.18  The National Institute for Education (NIlE) would continue to develop&#13;
programs for initial and continuing teacher education, and train teacher educators. It&#13;
would also deliver distance education programs to upgrade teachers, including diplomas in&#13;
education, B.Ed degrees, and post-graduate diplomas in education and management.&#13;
Given the change-over to initial training for all teachers entering the service, NIE's&#13;
delivery role should decline. It would work closely with the Universities and NATE. (See&#13;
Staffing and Staff Development, below).&#13;
2.19 Component C: Unprading of Teacher Education Programs Both initial and&#13;
continuing programs would be improved, to create a better learning climate in the schools&#13;
by raising the quality of teaching, and to make the teacher education programs more cost-&#13;
effective.&#13;
(a)   The initial (pre-service) teacher education program would prepare all&#13;
teachers prior to their entry into the teaching service. Successful completion&#13;
would be a pre-requisite for all seeking appointment as a teacher. Secondary&#13;
teachers would be trained in universities (Post Graduate Diploma in Education and&#13;
Bachelor of Education; primary teachers would follow two year courses in&#13;
NCOEs, and then a one year internship prior to the award of a Diploma in&#13;
Teaching. The NCOE curriculum is being revised, with ADB assistance (Annex&#13;
9). Each NCOE has been assigned geographically in response to enrollments and&#13;
needs for teachers (Annexes 19A and 19B). Teaching observation and practice in&#13;
affiliated schools would be essential. Entry to NCOEs would require a minimum&#13;
of 3 subject passes at A level; enrollment would be based on projected demand for&#13;
subject teachers. Within ten years, as the country moves towards having a teacher&#13;
force with degree qualifications, a three year Bachelor of Education should be&#13;
developed for NCOEs and selected universities.&#13;
(b)   The continuing (in-service) teacher education program, to improve the&#13;
quality of teachers already in the service, would offer courses in all teacher&#13;
education institutions - Universities, NIE and NCOEs (including TCs). There&#13;
would be four major types of continuing teacher education courses: (i) upgrading;&#13;
(ii) broadening; (iii) re-training; and (iv) refresher courses (see Annex 20 for&#13;
details). The sub-component builds on and complements the present distance&#13;
education program (assisted by SIDA) which has been making important progress&#13;
in providing a first level certification to untrained teachers. The continuing&#13;
education program, as expanded by the Project, would thus continue the important&#13;
work of giving all untrained teachers a first training, undertake further upgrading,&#13;
and offer refresher courses for lowly qualified teachers. Course design would be&#13;
modified by NIE, based on an on-going needs assessments, using technical&#13;
assistance. (see Component D, Staff Development, and Annex 11).&#13;
2.20  A plan for teacher demand and supply for primary and secondary education (1996-&#13;
2005) was prepared. Projections of teacher stock for primary are based on the annual&#13;
attrition of 2.8% and the recruitment of NCOEs diplomates according to the institutions&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
plan (Annex 21A and 21B). At the primary level the number of teachers is expected to&#13;
decline by about 4,000 (6%) and the STR will increase from 25:1 to 27:1 by 2005. The&#13;
number of secondary teachers is expected to decrease by 13,000 (12%) and the STR&#13;
would remain slightly above 22:1. The projections of teacher stock for secondary are&#13;
based on the annual attrition, the recruitment of NCOEs diplomates and an estimated&#13;
maximum annual output of 750 from the universities (made-up of 400 trained university&#13;
graduates and about 350 untrained graduates both based on actual subject needs). The&#13;
above strategy will result in the NCOEs output matching the demand by year 2005 for&#13;
primary (with all teacher intake at the primary level being trained). In the case of&#13;
secondary the above strategy will result in the NCOEs and Universities output matching&#13;
the demand by year 2003 with all intake of teachers at the secondary level being trained.&#13;
2.21  In respect to teacher trainee intake and output a summary of agreements reached&#13;
with the MEHE, included in the policy letter, are:&#13;
*  intake to the existing and new NCOEs should follow the institutions plan&#13;
provided in Annex 21A taking into consideration the designed capacity under&#13;
the project (to match demand);&#13;
*  recruitment of graduate teachers would be the last resort and carried out only&#13;
after and in coordination with efforts in re-training some of the surplus&#13;
existing teachers while filling the shortages based on subject needs;&#13;
*  place a ceiling 750 on graduate teacher recruitment (made-up of 400 trained&#13;
university graduates with PG diplomas and 350 untrained university graduates&#13;
for special subject needs following prerequisite short-term training of 3&#13;
months). This will involve the gradual increase of PG diploma and a limited&#13;
number of B.ED graduates to reach an all trained graduate system intake of&#13;
750 by year 2003; and&#13;
*  intake into university post graduate diploma should be according to subject&#13;
needs identified by the provinces, consolidated by MEHE, and transmitted to&#13;
the universities by NATE [para. 5.1 (d)].&#13;
2.22  The component would include the following technical assistance, overseas&#13;
assignments and fellowships (see Annex 14 for details): (i) 51 consultant months for&#13;
program design and courses outlines; (ii) 42 consultant months for teacher educator&#13;
training in new programs and 180 persons months for curriculum development of pre-&#13;
service teacher education programs; (iii) 40 consultant months for the design, update and&#13;
development of continuing programs; (iv) 6 international consultants for assessment and&#13;
modification of certification and 10 consultant months of national consultants to conduct&#13;
pilot needs assessment; (v) 48 consultant months for national curriculum development at&#13;
NIE; (vi) three consultant months to update and develop student selection criteria; (vii)&#13;
annual seminars for teacher educators; (viii) pilot initiatives in teacher education; and (ix)&#13;
update and develop continuing education materials and their printing costs. The Project&#13;
would provide books for libraries, equipment and educational materials at the university&#13;
Faculties of Education, NIE, the TCs, and the NCOEs. Details are given in Annex 11.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.23  Component D: Strengthening of Staff and Manaeement: The proposed 14&#13;
NCOEs and about 80 TCs Type A and 3 Type B/TEIs would require about 190&#13;
administrative and 1110 academic staff (Annex 22 outlines the NCOE staffing). Staffing&#13;
of the four universities and NIE (Department of Distance Education and Department of&#13;
Teacher Education) central campuses would remain at approximately the current level of&#13;
about 160. During the first two years of the project conversion would be made to the new&#13;
staffing structure. The majority of staff appointments would be made from the existing&#13;
staff at COEs, TTCs and study centers and would be based on agreed criteria outlined in&#13;
Annex 23. Staff in NCOEs, including TCs, would belong to the Teacher Educator cadre.&#13;
Part-time staff may be required for specific courses and could be recruited locally as&#13;
needed. A data base of existing teacher educators has been compiled and analyzed to&#13;
determine their training needs. The project would provide opportunities for staff who&#13;
meet agreed criteria to improve their teacher education qualifications and experience. A&#13;
teacher educator staff development plan has been prepared (Annex 24 ). The goal would&#13;
be to maintain following 1999, a more highly qualified Teacher Educator Service&#13;
comprising about 10 percent with Ph.Ds, 45 percent with Masters degrees, 35-40 percent&#13;
with advanced diplomas, and about 10-15 percent with a first degree. During&#13;
negotiations. the Government provided assurances that it will: carry-out until the&#13;
completion of the Project, a staff development plan for teacher educators, satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, in accordance with criteria satisfactory to the Association for the selection,&#13;
bonding, and assignment and reassignment of trainees [para 5.1 (f)].&#13;
2.24  The staff development plan, financed under the project, would cover the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) Long-term fellowships: about 250 long-term fellowships (about 25 percent of&#13;
teacher educator staff). About 150 educators would study in Sri Lanka&#13;
($675,000); 50 in regional countries ($400,000); and another 50 in OECD&#13;
countries ($3.0 million). Training (two years of study for each teacher educator,&#13;
usually at post-graduate level) would cover content knowledge and pedagogy.&#13;
(b) Linkages with overseas institutions: About four teacher education&#13;
institutions would be identified overseas as link institutions, the focal points for&#13;
work assignments, exchanges and training of staff. Selected teacher educators (20&#13;
educators for 3 month internships each year over a period of 4 years for a total of&#13;
$600,000) would work at link institutions to learn modem approaches. Teacher&#13;
educators from the link institutions would visit Sri Lanka (6 staff for about 2&#13;
months per year for 4 years for a total cost of about $720,000) to conduct courses&#13;
and seminars. The costs of establishing and maintaining these linkages are&#13;
estimated at $10,000 per institution. To support exchange of knowledge with the&#13;
link institutions and avail the teacher training institutions of the "ERIC education&#13;
library service" the project would also support a computer network (Internet).&#13;
The unit cost of the equipment needed for 19 local institutions (14 NCOEs, 4&#13;
Faculties of Education, NIE) and MEHE/NATE (total of 20) is estimated at $&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100,000. Internet time use is estimated at $ 60,000, training in the Internet&#13;
estimated at $15,000, and Internet operational costs about US$175,000.&#13;
(c) Short-term internships and study visits: About 160 teacher educators (2&#13;
from each institution) would undertake 3 month visits to institutions in OECD&#13;
countries (most at link institutions) to gain experience of teaching and teacher&#13;
education methods (estimated cost $1.0 million). Another 160 teacher educators&#13;
would visit regional countries for about 4 to 6 weeks over the period of the&#13;
project. In the case of teacher educators over 45 years of age training will be&#13;
short-term and with at least three to five years to serve before retirement.&#13;
(d) Continuing teacher education: The project would support continuing&#13;
education for teachers (US$3.6 million) through NIE, the NCOEs and the TCs.&#13;
Part of this effort is to be financed by SIDA, which is already making an important&#13;
contribution to teacher education. This sub-component would be based on&#13;
programs and materials agreed to during annual reviews (Annex 20).&#13;
(e) Other training activities: The project would also support other training&#13;
activities, such as an annual conference for teacher educators, visits by staff from&#13;
teacher education institutions to other Sri Lanka institutions to observe initiatives,&#13;
training in data collection and analysis and educational planning techniques&#13;
(including technical assistance on course design), translation and printing of&#13;
education research reports and theses, and an annual writing competition to&#13;
develop instructional materials to be used by teacher educators.&#13;
2.25  Component E: StrenEtheninf and Upgrading of the Teacher Training&#13;
Institutions: The component would: (i) rationalize the number and location of teacher&#13;
education institutions to improve regional equity and to meet needs for initial and&#13;
continuing education; and (ii) improve the quality of facilities and equipment. The&#13;
proposed rationalization would reduce unit costs of operation, improve access and reduce&#13;
the proportion of residential facilities for initial training. The 31 institutions now involved&#13;
in delivery of teacher education would be reduced to 19 (14 NCOEs, 4 universities, and&#13;
NIE); the 250 teacher centers (mostly now in school buildings) would be reduced to 81.&#13;
Many institutions are not now located where they are needed (based on demographic and&#13;
enrollment data), and others use buildings that need to be replaced. It will be more cost-&#13;
effective to construct five new NCOEs than to upgrade existing buildings, although most&#13;
existing buildings not needed for NCOEs will be used as TCs. Relocation would allow an&#13;
increase in the number of day students, reducing operation costs, while increasing&#13;
residential facilities for women. All buildings in satisfactory condition would be retained.&#13;
2.26  The project would support: (i) rehabilitation and extension of 9 existing COEs,&#13;
upgrading them to NCOEs; (ii) construction of 5 new NCOEs; (iii) upgrading facilities&#13;
for teacher education at the Universities of Colombo and Jaffna; (iv) refurbishing,&#13;
furnishing and equipping 60 TCs/Type A and 3 Type B/TEIs; (v) developing, refurbishing&#13;
furnishing and equipping a further 18 TCs/Type A within existing facilities; and (vi)&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
furnishing and equipping 14 NCOEs, NIE, the Universities of Colombo, Peradeniya,&#13;
Jaffna and Open University. ADB is expected to finance the 3 Type B TCs/TEIs. The&#13;
civil works will be undertaken at existing sites or at sites already acquired. The TCs will&#13;
continue primarily to conduct courses in existing schools. Details of institutional&#13;
rationalization are provided in Annex 19A and 19B.&#13;
2.27 A National Teacher Education Physical Planning and Building Committee in&#13;
NATE would provide standards for construction, renovation and maintenance. It would&#13;
also review the proposed physical plans for different types of teacher education institutions&#13;
to ensure that norms, agreed during appraisal, are met. The physical facilities identified&#13;
for each institution result from an exercise which matched the revised/proposed&#13;
curriculum and the resources/spaces required to achieve these goals. Detailed education&#13;
and architectural worksheets have been prepared for each institution and are included in&#13;
the Implementation Volume. Thus, the facilities proposed are in response to actual needs&#13;
and programs to be offered in each institution.&#13;
2.28  Many of the project civil works and physical facilities inputs are at existing&#13;
institutions (Annex 25); the focus would be on improving facilities to acceptable common&#13;
standards. The unit investment cost (civil works, architectural fees, furniture and&#13;
equipment) per student place would vary from US$1,000 - 4,600 for the existing&#13;
institutions and about US$7,400 - 8,100, dependent on site, for the new facilities. These&#13;
norms are based on other IDA-financed projects in Asia and on the UNESCO&#13;
recommended average space allocations. Detailed design work for each institution is&#13;
being completed (architectural estimates based on educational worksheets will be available&#13;
in the implementation volume). The current Secondary Education Development Project&#13;
(Credit 1 247-SRI) financed by ADB covers the rehabilitation of some of these institutions,&#13;
and agreement has been reached on coordinating activities.&#13;
2.29  Each institution would prepare, by the end of the second year of the project, a&#13;
comprehensive maintenance plan with budget requirements (based on criteria developed&#13;
by the School Construction Unit during the first year of the project). Upon endorsement&#13;
of these plans by NATE, a basis for allocation of maintenance funds would be formulated&#13;
[para. 5.1 (b)]. The institutions would administer the program, prepare annual reports of&#13;
needs and on that basis receive future annual allocations. The project would train the&#13;
institutions' maintenance officers.&#13;
2.30 Component F: Strengthen Management and Administration of Teacher&#13;
Education Institutions: The Project would address the management and funding policies&#13;
of the post-secondary teacher education institutions, which will, under coordination of&#13;
NATE and the Chief Commissioner of Teacher Education, be given more opportunities&#13;
for self-management, including of their budgets. Budgets would be computerized. Self-&#13;
management will allow the institutions realistic amounts for daily operation and&#13;
maintenance (contrary to the present system where authorization is needed to spend&#13;
$10.00). Annually, each institution (including the university Faculties of Education and&#13;
NIE Teacher Education and Distance Education Departments) would submit to NATE a&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
budget following prescribed categories and agreed norms and unit cost allocations. Once&#13;
accepted by NATE, these budget lines/items would be included in the operational budgets&#13;
of the respective universities, NIE and MEHE (subdivided directly to the other&#13;
institutions), dedicated to teacher training. Within that scenario, each institution will&#13;
receive every semester about half of its budget (decentralized to the school with increased&#13;
accounting). The next semester's allocation would only be made following receipt of the&#13;
previous semester's accounting report. Budgets would be based on detailed analyses of&#13;
the needs of each institution, made during the first year of the Project coordinated by&#13;
NATE (Annex 11), to develop agreed unit costs. The project would support the review&#13;
of the system during the first year of the project; training in budgeting and administration&#13;
would be given to institution heads, accountants or registrars and other administrators&#13;
throughout the life of the project. During negotiations the Government gave assurances&#13;
that it will: (a) by January 1, 1998 formulate and furnish to the Association for its&#13;
concurrence, a system of unit cost budgetary allocation for teacher training institutions;&#13;
and (b) by January 1, 1999 commence the implementation of such system [para. 5.1 (g)].&#13;
2.31   Component G: Studies and Monitoring: Six main studies would be undertaken&#13;
during the project. Their principal focus would be on monitoring the impact of the policy&#13;
changes and restructuring envisaged under the project, with particular regard to: (i) impact of&#13;
rationalization of teacher deployment policies; (ii) teacher trainee access, progression,&#13;
repetition, and attrition; (iii) professional development of teacher:continuing education; (iv)&#13;
teacher education funding; (v) the effectiveness of the NATE and national system of teacher&#13;
education; (vi) study of quality inputs at the primary and secondary levels; and (vii) project&#13;
preparation. In addition, the project would support monitoring of the impact of improved&#13;
teacher education on student examinations and assist with the preparation of future project.&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference and estimated cost for these studies are provided in Annex 26.&#13;
B. Project context&#13;
2.32  Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA supports investments in the social sector&#13;
as an integral part of its program to assist in poverty reduction, economic, public sector&#13;
and public expenditure reforms, and as an investment in human capital that is a crucial&#13;
basis for wider development objectives. The World Bank 1995 paper on Priorities and&#13;
Strategies for Education notes that World Bank financing for education will generally be&#13;
designed to leverage spending and sector-wide policy change by national authorities,&#13;
focusing on institutional development and appropriate financial mechanisms. The present&#13;
project, and the program which it supports, coincide precisely with these objectives.&#13;
2.33   During the last two years, the Government and IDA have been building in-depth&#13;
knowledge of the education sector through joint and participatory analyses, some financed&#13;
from the World Bank sector work budget, some through the General Education Project,&#13;
some as preparation for this and future projects. These include: an Education and&#13;
Training Sector Strategy Report, Education Employment Linkages Report, Poverty&#13;
Report, Public Expenditure Report, Policy Issues in Teacher Training and Teacher&#13;
Deployment (issued June 1995), a Sector Finance Study (December 1995). IDA is also&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financing the mapping of school facilities leading to a rationalization of the number of&#13;
small schools, and a study of education expenditure, costs and financing is under way with&#13;
Japanese funding. In addition, with funds from the ongoing education project, a Book&#13;
Development Study, proposals for a "Functions, Staffing and Policy Planning Review" of&#13;
the education administration, and a Management Training Needs Assessment for principals&#13;
have been undertaken. The preparation team drew heavily on the experiences of projects&#13;
in similar countries, during discussions with the Government. Reports and policy&#13;
proposals have been widely discussed in a series of dissemination workshops.&#13;
2.34  The above participatory process has established Government and stakeholder&#13;
ownership for substantial institutional and policy change in the education sector. IDA has&#13;
a comparative advantage in sector knowledge, has developed a cordial but frank dialogue&#13;
and still appears to be the main donor willing to address policy issues. The above factors&#13;
led Government in November 1994 to request IDA's continued and expanded involvement&#13;
in the education and training sectors, as a key part of our operational program. In April&#13;
1995 Government further sought specific IDA assistance for the rationalization of teacher&#13;
education and teacher hiring policies and deployment practices. IDA is in a good position&#13;
to respond to Government's request and to assist with further support in the sector, and is&#13;
the only donor able to play such a role. The project is fully consistent with the CAS,&#13;
described in Chapter 1, which provides for continuing to support the Sri Lanka education&#13;
development program through a two phase process: first a teacher training and&#13;
deployment project to address the most urgent needs, followed by a wider education&#13;
sector operation focused on other aspects of education quality.&#13;
2.35  Poverty Category and Program Objectives: The Project forms part of the&#13;
Program of Targeted Interventions. Poverty is widespread in Sri Lanka particularly in the&#13;
rural areas and in the urban slums. These areas suffer from inferior education services&#13;
directly linked to the predominance of untrained teachers, higher teacher absenteeism, and&#13;
inadequate inputs. A major focus of the project would be to assist the children in these&#13;
schools through upgrading of teachers and measures to ensure that teachers are present&#13;
and teaching. Better trained teachers should improve the quality of education in all&#13;
schools (benefiting all 4.1 million students): however since schools in rural and slum areas&#13;
currently suffer disproportionately from lack of trained teachers and from teacher&#13;
absenteeism, the project outcome of better availability of trained teachers and better&#13;
teacher deployment is likely to be disproportionately beneficial in improving the learning&#13;
opportunities of poor children. Improved teaching/learning quality will enhance the&#13;
education opportunities of children from disadvantaged areas and eventually improve their&#13;
earning capacity, thus increasing their contributions to the economy. Data on how the&#13;
number of untrained teachers has been reduced in rural and slum areas would be&#13;
monitored as part of the MEHE annual statistical collection and analysis. The impact on&#13;
school examination and promotion would also be analyzed during project implementation.&#13;
2.36  Other Donor Participation: Other donors who have indicated interest in&#13;
participating in this project are ADB, Swedish SIDA, AusAID and for the German&#13;
Government, GTZ. The secondary education project which ADB is currently financing&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
includes components relevant to teacher education. They are (a) rehabilitation of Teacher&#13;
Training Colleges; (b) curriculum development for primary, secondary and teacher&#13;
education; and (c) support for technical assistance and external fellowships for teacher&#13;
educators. Government has reviewed the design of the teacher education components of&#13;
the ADB-financed operation jointly with ADB and IDA in the context of the wider&#13;
reforms that it now wishes to undertake, and has agreed with ADB to modify them&#13;
accordingly. SIDA will continue to support distance education activities and the German&#13;
Government through GTZ intend to appraise in June 1996 the staff development&#13;
component. AusAid wants to assist with link institutions but not until 1997.&#13;
C. Environmental Considerations&#13;
2.37  The project is in Environmental Category C, in that none of the construction&#13;
activities are likely to have any significant environmental impact. For the larger buildings&#13;
in the project (5 NCOEs) an environmental review will be undertaken during the design&#13;
stage, by the Central Environment Authority which regularly reviews larger construction&#13;
proposals. Sri Lanka has a sound environmental program and was one of the first to&#13;
develop a National Environmental Action Program. The education system has programs&#13;
to support the national environmental effort. Environmental studies are already part of the&#13;
teacher training programs and the school curriculum. Practical environmental activities&#13;
are an integral part of teacher education, and environmental knowledge will be&#13;
strengthened as a result of improved teacher training programs. The agencies responsible&#13;
for revising teacher training programs will establish links with the Central Environment&#13;
Authority set up in 1980 under the National Environmental Act. The project would also&#13;
establish links with the Environment Division within the Ministry of Transport and Women&#13;
Affairs (set up in 1990). Finally, the project would confer with the staff implementing the&#13;
proposed Environment Action 1 Program being prepared by ID.&#13;
D: Women in Development&#13;
2.38   Sri Lanka has attained a unique position among developing countries since it has&#13;
reached equitable female participation at all levels of education and training. All girls,&#13;
except a few in rural areas, complete primary education and most complete about grade 10&#13;
(O Level). Since 1993 female participation at A level and university has equaled that of&#13;
males. Female enrollments continue to dominate in certain areas such as humanities,&#13;
health services and teacher education programs. Women are rapidly integrating into the&#13;
service industry. In 1994, women comprised about 80 percent of the primary and 60&#13;
percent of the secondary school teachers and in total averaged over 70 percent of all&#13;
teachers at all levels. The average age of women teachers is only about 35 years. Women&#13;
are less represented in administrative areas and continued attention is required to increase&#13;
their opportunities, their representation as principals still only totals about 35 percent.&#13;
Finally, national reports have estimated that the equitable participation of female in&#13;
education has greatly assisted in reducing the birth rate in Sri Lanka now down to 1.4&#13;
percent and expected to further decline.&#13;

3.2    Basis for cost estimates: Baseline costs are estimated at October 1995 prices, at&#13;
the time of appraisal. Construction costs are based on US$240 to US$270 per square&#13;
meter depending on construction standards for new construction and on specific estimates&#13;
for rehabilitation. Architectural services, including site supervision, are estimated at 8.5&#13;
percent of construction costs. Furniture costs are based on 8 to 10 percent of&#13;
construction costs. Equipment costs are based on specific estimates depending on the&#13;
activities, level of training and the kind of facilities. Unit cost for fellowships are based&#13;
on annual rates of US$600 for local, US$7,200 for regional and US$30,000 for OECD&#13;
countries. International consultant costs are estimated at: US$12,500 per month salary,&#13;
daily allowances US$150 and travel cost US$5,500. Unit costs per month of local&#13;
technical assistance are estimated at US$1,300 per consultant. Books and educational&#13;
material are based on specific estimates of existing books for the Teacher Education&#13;
Program, Training, and Staff Development of Teacher Educators and include all costs for&#13;
development, translation and printing. National training programs are estimated on the&#13;
basis of ongoing training programs and a per trainee unit cost of $1,000 (including&#13;
organization and instruction costs) for management training programs and other in-&#13;
country training. Continuing education, which includes upgrading, re-training, and&#13;
refresher courses, is estimated at US$10.00 per trainee day, US$16.00 per trainee day for&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
residential programs, and US$70.00 per trainee week of residential training and US$6.00&#13;
per trainee day for refresher courses. Teacher incentives to be paid by the Government&#13;
were estimated at 15 percent of average teacher salary for the most difficult schools, and&#13;
10 percent for difficult schools. Supplementary materials for the difficult schools having&#13;
to use multi-class training were estimated at about US$200 p.a. per class and education&#13;
support for the children of the teachers remaining in difficult schools were estimated at&#13;
Rs.500 p.a. per student. Salaries for NATE will be paid on a declining basis (90 percent&#13;
years I and 2; 60 percent years 3 and 4, and 30 percent year five).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3.3   Contingency Allowances: The contingency allowances of US$ 11.6 million&#13;
(about 17% of baseline cost) include contingencies for physical and price increases.&#13;
Physical contingencies are estimated at 10 percent of the baseline costs for civil works&#13;
and 5 percent for all other categories of expenditure. It is estimated that price increases&#13;
will vary from 2 to 2.2 percent per year for foreign expenditures and from 6 to 8 percent&#13;
per year for local expenditures during the implementation period.&#13;
3.4   Foreign Exchange Component (excluding contingencies): The foreign exchange&#13;
cost of US$36.5 million (about 46 percent of total estimated project costs) has been&#13;
calculated on the basis of the following foreign exchange percentages: civil works 25&#13;
percent; architectural and technical studies 20 percent; furniture 50 percent; equipment&#13;
100 percent, books, educational materials and printing contracts 100 percent, overseas&#13;
specialists 100 percent; national specialists 0 percent; external training 100 percent, in-&#13;
country training 0 percent, studies 80 percent, project coordination 20 percent and&#13;
recurrent costs 0 percent.&#13;
3.5   Retroactive Financing estimated at US$0.8 million is provided for employment&#13;
of architectural consultants, for the salary of project coordinating unit (PCU) officers&#13;
(future director and support staff) and for the establishment of the NATE office&#13;
(computers, furniture, office supplies and vehicles). These funds would be used for the&#13;
preparation of architectural designs ensuring that project preparation is in place and start-&#13;
up occurs immediately after effectiveness.&#13;
3.6   Financing Plan: The proposed IDA credit of US$64.1 million equivalent would&#13;
finance about 81 percent of the total estimated project costs (Table 3.3 below). Based on&#13;
Government discussions with ADB it has been agreed that ADB would, from its&#13;
ongoing credit (parallel), finance civil works, furniture and equipment at teacher&#13;
centers, supply technical assistance for curriculum development and fund&#13;
fellowships. SIDA has agreed to adjust its present distance education program to fit the&#13;
project goals and will contribute, independently about US$2.4 million from 1996 to 1998.&#13;
The German Government intends to appraise in June 1996 the staff development&#13;
component and that amount is still to be determined. AusAid have indicated interest in&#13;
supporting link institutions arrangement but cannot make any firm commitments until&#13;
1997. On that basis, the Government decided that the appraisal estimates, as approved by&#13;
Cabinet, would be retained and the allocation of the IDA amount would be adjusted&#13;
during the mid-term review based upon future allocations received from SIDA, the&#13;
German Government and AusAid. On the basis of the above, ADB is expected to finance&#13;
about 6.2 percent of the project and the Government about 10 percent of the total project&#13;
costs. The IDA credit would cover about 81 percent of the estimated foreign exchange&#13;
costs of the project. The financing plan follows:&#13;

3.8     Procurement thresholds and prior review requirements are outlined in Annex 28&#13;
and the Government's procurement capacity in Annex 29. About US$33.2 million of the&#13;
contracts for civil works for new construction, major extensions and renovations at the&#13;
NCOEs would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures including a seven and half percent preferential treatment to national bidders. It&#13;
36 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is expected that about 15 contracts will be awarded using ICB. Because the remainder of&#13;
the institutions are scattered throughout the country, rehabilitation and refurbishing&#13;
contracts at NCOEs with smaller inputs, at about 80TCs and at two universities (Colombo&#13;
and Jaffia) estimated at US$7.4 million, would be awarded on the basis of National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) (contracts estimated to be about US$300,000 at the&#13;
universities and between US$50,000-$100,000 at the TCs). The NCB contract bids&#13;
would include foreign bidders, using tender procedures acceptable to the Association&#13;
(Table 3.5). For the ICB and NCB tenders, the IDA Standard Bidding Documentation&#13;
would be used. Other civil works activities (TC Type B/TEI) estimated at US$2.6 million&#13;
will be covered by ADB under their own regulations and as part of an ongoing project.&#13;

3.9    Architectural and Technical Studies. Consultants would be selected in&#13;
accordance with the Association's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (US$3.2 million).&#13;
Consultant contracts would result from competition based on selection criteria and specific&#13;
terms of reference. Contracts with consulting firms costing more than US$100,000 and&#13;
contracts for individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Association. Architectural services related to TC Type B/TEI&#13;
(US$0.3 million) would be selected under ADB regulations.&#13;
3.10   The procurement of furniture for the NCOEs would be done on the basis of&#13;
NCB (US$2.7 million). The furniture tenders for the Universities, the TCs Type A and&#13;
NATE would be done through local shopping on the basis of three price quotations&#13;
(estimated at US$0.3 million). The initial tendering documentation would be subject to&#13;
IDA prior review. The remaining furniture tenders for TCs Type B/TEI (US$0.2 million)&#13;
would be done under ADB regulations. The procurement schedule for civil works and&#13;
linked furniture and equipment is outlined in Annex 30.&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.11  Equipment packages (including computers) estimated to cost US$4.6 million&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of ICB and in accordance with IDA Guidelines and will&#13;
be subject to IDA prior review. Other equipment estimated to cost less than US$50,000&#13;
per package and aggregating to US$500,000 could be procured by international shopping&#13;
on the basis of quotations from a minimum of three suppliers. Vehicles for PCU, NATE&#13;
and NCOEs, estimated at US$600,000 would be procured on the basis of NCB.&#13;
Equipment related to TC Type B/TEI estimated to cost US$0.7 mnillion would be&#13;
procured under ADB regulations.&#13;
3.12  Books, Educational Materials; Reference and library books and educational&#13;
materials including computer software (estimated to cost U S$2.7 million) would be&#13;
procured directly from the publishers on the basis of pro-forma invoices. The project&#13;
would cover the production of textbooks produced by the Government or by joint&#13;
Government and private sector printers and in a few cases for direct production costs by&#13;
publishers. Library books would be purchased directly from the suppliers following&#13;
negotiations for volume/quantities and on the basis of pro-forma invoices. Whenever two&#13;
or more similar books exist, comparative bids would be sought from a minimum of two&#13;
publishers. Printing contracts for printing curriculum materials (estimated at US$] .3&#13;
million) would be awarded on the basis of quotations from a minimum of three printers.&#13;
3.13  For ICB procurement, the standard IDA ICB bidding documentation would be&#13;
used, with prior review by the Association of bidding documentation. Contracts for&#13;
goods and equipment estimated to cost US$50,000 or more and for civil works contracts&#13;
estimated to cost US$300,000 or more will be subject to IDA prior review. Based on&#13;
project experience the Government has the capacity to undertake the procurement.&#13;
3.14  Technical Assistance and Training: The types of consultants and technical&#13;
assistance are summarized in Annex 14. Consultant costs are estimated at US$5.8&#13;
million with IDA financing US$4.6 mnillion and ADB financing UJS$1.2 million.&#13;
Consultants under IDA financing would be selected in accordance with the Association's&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Consultant contracts, either local or international,&#13;
would result from competition based on selection criteria and specific terms of reference.&#13;
The GOSL will request expressions of interest from suitable firms through advertisement&#13;
in the Development Business in order to develop the short-lists. All international&#13;
consultants will be selected using competitive procedures acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
consultant TORs would be reviewed by IDA prior to tenders. Contracts with consulting&#13;
firms costing more than US$100,000 and contracts for individual consultants costing&#13;
more than US$50,000 would be subject to prior review by the Association. For national&#13;
consultancies three firms, institutions or specialists would be sought based on advertised&#13;
criteria and terms of references. For specific subject (upgrading and on-the-job training&#13;
of national teacher educators) international technical assistance and consultancies based&#13;
on comparative costs estimates would be sought from potential link institutions and&#13;
institutions/specialists located in a minimum of two countries.&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.15 External Training estimated at US$6.6 million will cover regional training and&#13;
workshops (US$0.5 million), OECD training workshops (US$3.6 million); and&#13;
fellowships and study tours (US$2.5 million). Payments would be based on statements of&#13;
expenditures and annually agreed rates or unit costs covering expenditures for course&#13;
operation, trainee stipends, travel and lodging and for monitoring activities. Training&#13;
activities would also cover inter institution seminars and visits to the link institutions.&#13;
Lists of seminars, with expected costs, would be reviewed annually. Fellowships would&#13;
be awarded under government procedures and criteria acceptable to the Association and&#13;
in concurrence with the staff development plan agreed during negotiations. During&#13;
negotiations the Government gave assurances that it will carry out the technical assistance&#13;
and training programs in accordance with terms of reference and time schedules&#13;
satisfactory to the Association [para 5.2 (h)].&#13;
3.16 In country training/workshops estimated at US$4.7 million would cover&#13;
national fellowships, continuing education, conferences and seminars including&#13;
subsistence and travel for the upgrading of teachers. About US$3.6 millioll of the above&#13;
would cover the continued upgrading of untrained teachers through the distance&#13;
education/in-service modes. A large part of the continuing and distance education/in-&#13;
service costs would be funded by other donors in accordance with their procedures.&#13;
3.17 Disbursement: To expedite disbursements, a special account with an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$2.5 million representing about four months' average disbursements&#13;
would be established at MEHE in coordination with MOFP and Central Bank.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Account, supported by appropriate documentation,&#13;
would be submitted regularly (preferably monthly, but no less than quarterly) or when the&#13;
amounts withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit. Disbursements would be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE) against: (i) contracts of less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for goods and vehicles; (ii) contracts for less than US$300,000&#13;
equivalent for works; (iii) consultant contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
firms and US$50,000 for individual contracts; (iv) local training; and (v) project&#13;
management and recurrent costs. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by&#13;
the project coordination unit and made available for inspection during the course of IDA&#13;
supervision missions. Disbursements for all other expenditures would be against full&#13;
documentation. The proposed credit of UJS$64.1 million equivalent would be disbursed&#13;
over a period of five years (Annex 31). Disbursements would be made in the following&#13;
manner: (i) civil works 100 percent of foreign and 80 percent of local expenditures (para.&#13;
3.8). All civil works should be completed within the first four years of the project&#13;
period; (ii) architectural and technical studies 1 00 percent of expenditures (para. 3.9);&#13;
(iii) firniture, vehicles and equipment at 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 100&#13;
percent of local expenditures (ex factory) and 85 percent of expenditures for other items&#13;
procured locally (paras. 3.10 and 3.1 1 ); (iv) books, educational materials and local&#13;
printing at 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of local expenditures (para.&#13;
3. 1 2); (v) technical assistance and external training 1 00 percent of total expenditures&#13;
(paras. 3.14 and 3 .15); (vi) in country training I 00 percent of total expenditures (para.&#13;
3.16); (vii) studies 100 percent of total expenditures (para. 3.26): and (viii) project&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
management and NATE on a declining basis: 90 percent in FY96 and 1997. 60 percent in&#13;
FY1998 and 1999 and 30 percent thereafter. D)isbursements of local expenditures for&#13;
whiclh 100 percenit of total financing is supported by the project. c.g.. equipment, books&#13;
and edLucationial materials and local printing and project management would be net of&#13;
taxes and other mark-up costs.&#13;
3.18 Accounts and Audit: The MEHE. Ministry of Finance and Planning and the&#13;
project coordination unit would establish and maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures. The accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices acceptable to the Association. Auditing would be performed annually by a&#13;
qualified auditor in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association and an&#13;
audit report, including separate statements on disbursements against statements of&#13;
expenditures and on the Special Account, submitted to the Association.&#13;
3.19  Project Management: The first project gave IDA an entry into the sector and&#13;
much of the ongoing work has been a major building block for future operations. Based&#13;
on the experiences of the first education project which assigned the implementation&#13;
responsibilities to the different management units within MEHE and provincial&#13;
authorities, implementation roles are well defined. However, based on lessons of the&#13;
ongoing project. these responsibilities would be reviewed each year, during the annual&#13;
review. To ensure effective implementation, there is also a need to ensure that sufficient&#13;
technical assistance is attached to the project to train and assist MEHE in procurement&#13;
and management skills so the processing of these activities can be improved in timing&#13;
and quality.&#13;
3.20  The lead agency for project implementation will be the MEHE. PCU will be&#13;
given the responsibilities to: (i) coordinate the IDA resources; and (ii) coordinate the&#13;
monitoring and reporting aspects of the project. PCU will work closely with NATE, the&#13;
MOFP, NIE, the provincial authorities and the Universities, which are responsible for the&#13;
training, recruitment, and monitoring of teachers. The project would cover the following&#13;
costs for PCU: (i) project coordination estimated at 1]S$0.9 million; and (ii) recurrent&#13;
costs of IJSSO.7 nmillion to cover PCU for on-site supervision, the purchase of furniture&#13;
and equipment and for the office and staff related implementation costs.&#13;
3.21   The project civil works implementation indicators are included in Annex 32 and&#13;
the project's implementation plan that includes objectives, key indicators, targets, and&#13;
implementation responsibilities are outlined in Annex 33. In addition, a Project&#13;
Implementation Volume outlining the implementation and monitoring steps has been&#13;
prepared and will be used to guide implementation.&#13;
3.22  With regard to physical aspects and as initial tasks, the PCU in collaboration with&#13;
MEHE/School Construction Unit will: (i) ensure that the 5 new NCOE and TCs' designs&#13;
are completed at the earliest for IDA review and tendering; (ii) ensure the supervision of&#13;
the architectural and technical studies related to NCOEs and the University of Jaffna and&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Colombo Faculty of Education; and (iii) PCU/School Works would be responsible&#13;
for ensuring the timely implementation and supervision of all the civil works activities.&#13;
3.23  The selection and detailed implementation of works and organization of the&#13;
tendering process would be the responsibility of MEHE/PCU assisted by the School&#13;
Construction Unit (SCU). Supervision of the works for the NCOEs and Universities&#13;
would be provided by contracted architectural firms or full-time assigned architects from&#13;
SCU. For the designs and supervision of theTCs, the MEHE/PCU would obtain the&#13;
assistance of the Provincial Education Departments and Ministry of Public Works units&#13;
jointly responsible for public works in their area. In addition to the above, regular&#13;
supervision will be undertaken by MEHE/PCU/SCU and permanent on-site supervisors&#13;
will be assigned to each NCOE. Final detailed specifications and preparation of the&#13;
tendering documentation will be the responsibility of PCU.&#13;
3.24  For equipment, initial lists (subject and program based) with specifications&#13;
appropriate to the syllabi, would be prepared by NIE in consultation with the lecturers in&#13;
the various teacher training institutions. The universities would prepare their own&#13;
equipment lists. The equipment and furniture lists, specifications and tender&#13;
documentation (using IDA standard documents) would be finalized by PCU and&#13;
forwarded to IDA for prior review. PCU will be responsible for all contracts related to&#13;
physical, equipment and material aspects of the project. The provincial authorities would&#13;
assist PCU with the monitoring of delivery of furniture, equipment and educational&#13;
materials.&#13;
3.25  Government has agreed to staff PCU with: (i) a Director; (ii) an Accountant; (iii)&#13;
an Architect (linked with SCU); (iv) a Procurement Officer; and (v) a Teacher Educator&#13;
(most likely located in the office of the Teacher Education Commissioner). To assist&#13;
with project organization and start-up activities, the Director has already been appointed&#13;
by the MEHE. During negotiations Government gave assurances that it would: maintain&#13;
until completion of the project the PCU with terms of references satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, which shall be responsible for the overall implementation of the project&#13;
[para. 5.1 (i)].&#13;
3.26  Studies estimated at UJ%S$0.3 million are summarized in Annex 26. The aim of&#13;
the studies is to improve the quality and efficiency of the education system. The topics&#13;
addressed would be: (i) assessment of teacher education and staff development needs; (ii)&#13;
analysis of student access, progression, repetition and attrition and ways to improve&#13;
these; (iii) review of continuing education programs; (iv) impact of the rationalization of&#13;
teacher deployment policies, and teacher education funding; (v) the effect of improved&#13;
teachers' qualifications on pupil examination and promotion; (vi) study of quality inputs&#13;
at theprimary and secondary levels; and (vii) after the mid-term review, assessment of the&#13;
impact of NATE. For these studies, consultant contracts, either local or international&#13;
would result from competition based on selection criteria and specific terms of reference.&#13;
Consultants would be recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines (para. 3.14).&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.27 Monitoring, Reporting and Supervision: Sector and project performance would&#13;
be monitored in the following ways:&#13;
(a)   Arrangements are built into the project for NATE to monitor outcomes in&#13;
terms of teacher education, deployment and numbers. MEHE and MOFP&#13;
will monitor the project's fiscal impact. As part of the future work on&#13;
education sector development, a scheme for routine education assessment&#13;
will be developed during the coming year. The assessment process will&#13;
enable Government to monitor the effectiveness of the teacher education&#13;
project in improving education quality.&#13;
(b)   A semi-annual progress report on the implementation of the project's&#13;
policy and implementation aspects would be prepared by the PCU and&#13;
submitted to IDA in July and January every year. The report should&#13;
include: (i) a component by component summary of implementation&#13;
(actual versus planned), including for Component A analysis (on the basis&#13;
of NATE monitoring activities) of the application of the RR and its&#13;
results, and of budgetary allocations to provinces; (ii) a financial summary&#13;
by component including the status of commitments and of disbursements;&#13;
(iii) an updated implementation schedule and implementation plan and key&#13;
indicators; (v) a list of issues and problems faced with options for&#13;
resolution; (vi) status of the studies; (vii) status of technical assistance;&#13;
and (viii) a work plan for the following period.&#13;
(c)   PCU would coordinate with other departments of MEHE, MOF and&#13;
provincial authorities the semi-annual update, the implementation plan&#13;
and the review of key indicators. In the later years of the project, the&#13;
reporting would include the monitoring of the impact of better trained&#13;
teachers based on annual examination results (Annex 33). During&#13;
negotiations the Government gave assurances that it will: by January 1,&#13;
1997 and every six months thereafter, throughout the Project execution&#13;
period, update and furnish the Association for its review and approval the&#13;
implementation plan and the key indicators for the project [para. 5.1 (j)].&#13;
(d)   Annual implementation reviews would be held and the above&#13;
monitoring reports would be discussed with the authorities concerned and&#13;
with other donors participating in the project. During the annual review,&#13;
the status of the implementation of the RR will be examined and the&#13;
following year's goals set, as will the status of the reorganization of the&#13;
teacher education system. This joint review would be held about February&#13;
of each year. At negotiations Government gave assurances that it will:,&#13;
(a) maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with benchmarks and&#13;
indicators satisfactory to the Association, the carrying out of the Project&#13;
and the achievement of the objectives thereof (para. 3.28 below); (b)&#13;
prepare. under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, and&#13;
furnish the Association, by July 31, 1998, for the mid-term review (para&#13;
3.28 below): (i) a report integrating the results of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities of the project during the period preceding the date of&#13;
the said report and setting measures recommended to ensure the efficient&#13;
carrying out of the project during the period following that date, and (ii) a&#13;
specific report detailing the application of the Ready Reckoner formula&#13;
and whether the Cadre Committee, transfer policy, allocation of funds in&#13;
each province for quality inputs and school maintenance have reached the&#13;
targets set and are operating in a manner satisfactory to the Association;&#13;
and(c) review with the Association, by September 30, 1998, or such later&#13;
date as the Association shall request, the progress reports and take all&#13;
measures to ensure the efficient completion of the project [Section 5 para.&#13;
5.2 (k)].&#13;
3.28  The mid-term review would be conducted two years after credit effectiveness&#13;
(about July 1 998). Impleincntation progress after Pliase 1. would be evaluated according&#13;
to agreed benchmarks (described below). Project goals would be adjusted, if necessary,&#13;
to accelerate implementation and maximize the impact and sustainability of the project.&#13;
The Implementation benchmarks for the mid-term review are:&#13;
* the cadre committee be established, operating and the revised RR is&#13;
being implemented (including status of cadre at school, district,&#13;
province and national levels showing progress in matching demand&#13;
and supply of teachers - as per Annex 13);&#13;
- the transfer policy, established in 1995 is being implemented, in&#13;
accordance with the RR (as per Annex 6);&#13;
* implementing the consolidation measures at primary and secondary&#13;
levels listed in Annex 3;&#13;
* the primary STR increased to 26:1 at the primary and to 22:1 at the&#13;
secondary level;&#13;
* that NCOE intake follow the institutional plan outlined in Annex&#13;
21A;&#13;
*   the earmarking of quality inputs is initiated with a 3 percent&#13;
allocation in 1997 and increased to 4 percent in 1998 (increasing by I&#13;
43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
duplicating machine and paper; tool kits; consumable for science, life&#13;
skills, environmental studies, art, home economics and technical&#13;
subjects; minor maintenance after supervisory approval; audio-visual&#13;
equipment; when justified photo-copiers; and financial assistance for&#13;
organizing workshops, seminars and study/subject groups. Annual&#13;
reports on the quality inputs, their impact on exam results would be&#13;
assessed starting 1997;&#13;
*  One percent of the education capital budget allocated by the&#13;
Government, to each province, would be earmarked for the&#13;
maintenance of the schools. This amount would be assessed yearly,&#13;
during the first two years of the project to arrive at a facilities plan by&#13;
1998 at which time a realistic earmarking plan for the maintenance of&#13;
educational institutions and equipment would be established.&#13;
*   that implementation progresses to a level where the amounts&#13;
disbursed, contracted and committed would be as follows: for civil&#13;
works about 50 percent of the new institutions at Galle, Ratnapura,&#13;
Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala and for Jaffna at about 20 percent; for&#13;
the rehabilitation and renovations at existing institutions about 60&#13;
percent; for furniture supply about 50 percent; for equipment&#13;
procurement about 30 percent; for training activities about 45 percent&#13;
and for technical assistance and studies about 60 percent.&#13;
(a)    The IIDA supervision plan is outlined in Annex 34. This project would be&#13;
jointly supervised by IDA headquarters and the resident mission during the&#13;
first two years including a gradual decentralization to the resident mission.&#13;
Since this is a very technical project, the key supervision should be guided&#13;
by an experienced educator and an education economist who would ensure&#13;
the application of the staffing, deployment and financial policies of the&#13;
project; and&#13;
(b)   The Government would prepare and submit a project Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) to IDA no later than six months after the&#13;
project Closing Date.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
Economic Rationale for Project Investment&#13;
4.1   Sri Lanka's education system, despite its excellent coverage, has low internal and&#13;
external efficiency. The quality of its output is below the levels that could be expected&#13;
from the country's high literacy levels and coverage of education, and the substantial&#13;
inputs made to the system. In large measure these inefficiencies relate to the quality and&#13;
use of teachers. The uncontrolled recruitment of teachers has led to an exceptionally high&#13;
proportion of the teaching force being inexperienced and untrained; on the other hand&#13;
there are mismatches in the availability and use of teachers in different parts of the&#13;
country, for different types of school, and in different subject specialties. Teacher&#13;
absenteeism is high, and there is lack of continuity in that teachers transfer frequently away&#13;
from difficult areas. In addition, many of those teachers who have been trained are less&#13;
than fully productive because the neglected teacher training system is ineffective. The&#13;
training system is fragmented, uncoordinated, and has a high unit cost.&#13;
4.2   In view of these inadequacies, it was concluded that policy measures to improve&#13;
teacher deployment coupled with an investment project in teacher education would have&#13;
positive impact in many areas. The project will help the government implement its&#13;
program to manage teacher recruitment, employment and deployment, using the Ready&#13;
Reckoner resource allocation formula, a school consolidation policy based on school&#13;
mapping, and a revised teacher transfer policy, thus rationalizing deployment of almost&#13;
190,000 teachers; it will require that all teachers be trained before entering the service,&#13;
ensuring over the next five years that all of the teaching force is pre-trained, rationalizing&#13;
and upgrading the training levels of teacher education system. Research in Sri Lanka&#13;
shows that upgrading of teachers has a major impact on student learning and quality of&#13;
education.&#13;
4.3   Comparative analyses were made of various scenarios of modifying student-&#13;
teacher ratios and salary costs, as well as of various ways of providing cost-effective&#13;
teacher education and training. The conclusions of the selected scenario, described below,&#13;
constitute a basis of the Government's new strategies, and show that the strategies are&#13;
both feasible and highly cost effective.&#13;
45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.4    The Project will:&#13;
*   make teacher employment more efficient by standardizing teacher&#13;
recruitment, deployment, and training activities, as well as rationalizing&#13;
teacher numbers and redirecting savings to other priority educational&#13;
objectives;&#13;
*   make the teacher education system more effective by making it demand&#13;
driven to better address national, district, and school level needs, by&#13;
rationalizing the geographical distribution of institutions;&#13;
*   make the teacher education system more efficient through rationalizing the&#13;
number of teacher training institutions thus lowering the unit cost while&#13;
maximizing the utilization and making the institutions multi-functional. Also,&#13;
by increasing student:staff ratios, reducing non-academic staff, rationalizing&#13;
residential facilities according to demand, and increasing the proportion of day&#13;
students (thereby reducing boarding costs);&#13;
*   improve the quality of education for 4.1 million students in primary,&#13;
secondary, and collegiate levels by upgrading teachers, consequently&#13;
increasing school outcomes and reducing the cycle cost; and&#13;
*   make education more equitable and rationalize teacher distribution&#13;
according to school needs.&#13;
4.5    Project Benefits: The project provides benefits in the following overlapping&#13;
areas, related to the different activities it supports.&#13;
(a)    Teacher deployment. This component produces substantial savings from&#13;
reducing the numbers of teachers in the system, because of declining&#13;
enrollment, controlled teacher recruitment, more equitable allocation of&#13;
teachers and a policy to increase student:teacher ratios in schools. It also&#13;
leads to improved education since a more equitable allocation system will&#13;
provide trained teachers for children who at present have inadequate&#13;
teaching. School consolidation also leads to reduced expenditure on non-&#13;
teaching staff. Potential savings from this group of activities (that is total&#13;
expenditure on salaries compared with what would have been spent on&#13;
present trends) over the period 1996-05 could reach Rs 1.6 billion.&#13;
(b)   Components related to teacher education: These components provide for&#13;
rationalizing the structure and organization of pre-service and in-service&#13;
teacher education; improving teacher education programs; training teacher&#13;
educators and administrators; rehabilitating, expanding and rationalizing&#13;
46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
teacher training institutions; and strengthening teacher education&#13;
management. They will give rise to benefits in three ways:&#13;
*     they will improve the quality of teacher education, by better&#13;
programs and better teacher educators, thus improving the quality of&#13;
education which the trained teachers themselves provide;&#13;
*     they will increase the cost-effectiveness of teacher education,&#13;
through better situated training colleges which will allow a greater&#13;
proportion of students to be non-residential, through better planning of&#13;
teacher education, through increased trainee:trainer ratios, through shorter&#13;
courses, and through better use of facilities. The increased cost&#13;
effectiveness will allow the system to double its annual output of trained&#13;
teachers with only an increase of 14% in recurrent costs;&#13;
*     the project will increase the number of teachers trained, both by&#13;
increasing capacity for training teachers and by providing as part of the&#13;
project direct, continuing education to an increased number of teachers.&#13;
Thus by the end of the project most of the teachers in the system will have&#13;
been given basic teacher training, and many undergone upgrading. This&#13;
will have important benefits both for the general quality of education and&#13;
for the equity with which it is provided.&#13;
(c)    All components: In their effect on ensuring that there are trained teachers&#13;
available for the majority of students (and through the reallocation of the&#13;
savings from reducing the numbers of teachers to improve availability of&#13;
quality inputs), the project will improve general education levels. These&#13;
are the most important benefits to be derived from the project: the&#13;
unquantifiable effects for the quality of life and the economy, with the&#13;
indirect social and economic effects that stem from better education.&#13;
However, the improved quality will also reduce repetition and drop-out,&#13;
increasing the efficiency of the education system. In the best case (see&#13;
below) benefits from increased internal efficiency could total over Rs 2&#13;
billion over the period 1996-05.&#13;
4.6   Fiscal Sustainability: The Project and the programs it supports have a broadly&#13;
neutral fiscal impact. The declining enrollment in general education (both primary and&#13;
secondary) due to demographic trends, with the low STR of 24:1 and the excess of&#13;
teachers in the system, increases the need to rationalize use of education sector resources&#13;
at the school, provincial, and central levels. At the same time, the tight fiscal condition&#13;
and the increasing public budget deficit further intensify the need to rationalize&#13;
Government expenditures and, in turn, put more pressure on the MEHE and the provinces&#13;
to rationalize teacher numbers and their distribution through recruitment control and&#13;
consolidation of small schools. Teacher employment rationalization, linking application of&#13;
the mechanism to resource allocations, would generate substantial sector cost reductions.&#13;
Annex 12 contains an analysis of the project activities and of the reforms they will&#13;
support, their outcome, and (where possible) estimates of their costs and benefits. During&#13;
47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the period 1996-2005, aggregate salary expenditure (using the recent 1995 salary scale)&#13;
could be reduced by Rs 1.6 billion if teacher recruitment is controlled as planned, as the&#13;
total number of teachers and school administrators would be reduced by 25,000 by 2005&#13;
(Figures 4.1 and 4.2). If project-related reforms are carried out filly, and the&#13;
improvement in education progressively reduces repetition rates substantially, total fiscal&#13;
savings during the period 1996-2005 could in the best case add further savings of between&#13;
Rs 2 and 3 billion, making total savings for the 10 years over Rs 4 billion, or US$74&#13;
million, equivalent to the costs of the project and incremental expenditures on teacher&#13;
training. When the unquantifiable (but large) benefits from improved levels of general&#13;
education in the population at large are factored in, the project benefits are massive. The&#13;
saving in education salaries would be re-invested in desperately needed quality&#13;
components such as school supplies and teaching materials, increased teacher training, and&#13;
to develop support and incentive schemes to motivate teacher transfers to remote and&#13;
hardship areas.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.7    The project's largest benefits by far come from improving the quality of education&#13;
received by the 4.1 million students, by improving teacher competence. However,&#13;
improved education quality also increases internal efficiency. A recent study of education&#13;
in Sri Lanka (draft 1995) showed that the results of the 0 level exam were strongly&#13;
associated with teacher qualifications. Thus, an investment in improving teacher&#13;
qualifications is expected to increase efficiency of student progression through the system,&#13;
reducing costly repetition and drop-outs, improve examination results, and lead to&#13;
reductions in the system's cost. Analysis described in Annex 12 shows the potential&#13;
extent of such savings, between Rs 2 and 3 billion in the most optimistic case.&#13;
4.8    There will be substantial benefits from more efficient operation of the teacher&#13;
training institutions. The rationalization of teacher training institutions would lead to a&#13;
reduction in their residential places by one third of enrollment (now 100 percent&#13;
residential) and so in reduced running costs (currently residential facilities account for over&#13;
50 percent of institutional operating costs). Furthermore, the application of other cost-&#13;
effectiveness measures -- such as standardizing programs, offering several programs in one&#13;
location, having larger enrollments and increasing trainee:teacher educator ratios to 15: 1,&#13;
maximizing the use of standardized equipment and facilities, reducing the number of&#13;
support staff, reducing service costs through better location of institutions, and privatizing&#13;
food services -- would result in much lower annual recurrent costs. Studies in other Asian&#13;
countries that have rationalized their teacher training institutions through similar projects&#13;
have shown that the operation of fewer and more cost effective institutions has amortized&#13;
investment costs in about ten years and given long-term sustained lower operation costs.&#13;
4.9   Fiscal Sustainability of Teacher Training Reforms. The operational costs of&#13;
the rationalized teacher education system for the period 1994-2005, which were estimated&#13;
on the basis of the expected capacity needs, are reasonable, affordable and sustainable.&#13;
The proposed scheme was shown during project preparation to be the most cost-effective&#13;
means of achieving project objectives of several options that were analyzed. Annual&#13;
recurrent costs of the institutions of teacher education after rationalization (even with a&#13;
doubling of output) are expected to increase from Rs 221 million in 1995 to Rs 254&#13;
million after the end of the project in 2002, and then to decline slightly in real terms,&#13;
reaching Rs 252 million in 2005. Had the system operated in its present manner, annual&#13;
recurrent costs for the increased throughput of students would have reached Rs 314&#13;
million in 2002 and 367 million by 2005. The operating costs of teacher education&#13;
programs represent 7 percent of the total MEHE budget and 3.3 percent of the total&#13;
education budget. If the education budget grows as the Government projects at 3 percent&#13;
per year, recurrent costs of teacher education programs -- 14 percent higher in real term at&#13;
the end of the project, with a doubling of output -- will represent a smaller proportion&#13;
than at present of the education budget. Thus the combined expansion and rationalization&#13;
of teacher education programs and institutions is a desired, affordable and sustainable&#13;
action (Annex 36).&#13;
49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.10  Project activities also have other benefits that are difficult to quantify:&#13;
*  Reassignment of qualified teachers to deprived areas brings substantial&#13;
education benefits for the (mainly poor) children from those areas.&#13;
*  The reallocation to quality inputs and maintenance of salary savings resulting&#13;
from the stricter application of the RR would contribute to the positive impact&#13;
on education attainment and related effects.&#13;
*  The increased funds for building maintenance will lead to long-term savings in&#13;
building replacement.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
4.11   This policy-based project involves risks mainly related to policy implementation.&#13;
During project preparation it was agreed by all levels of government, teacher educators,&#13;
teachers and teacher associations that addressing teacher education and teacher&#13;
deployment policies was long overdue, and that the programs proposed were acceptable.&#13;
However, within the strongly political climate of Sri Lanka, circumstances can change&#13;
rapidly. The main risks envisaged are:&#13;
-  The political or bureaucratic commitment to the application of new teacher&#13;
deployment policies might not be fully implemented in some provinces. This&#13;
applies especially to those provinces which are overstaffed and which might be&#13;
reluctant to fully implement the Ready Reckoner formula. Similarly, some&#13;
provinces may be reluctant to redirect salary savings. If savings are lower, the&#13;
allocation for desperately needed quality inputs could, in turn, be reduced;&#13;
*  Some schools in the rural areas could still have inequitable allocations of&#13;
teachers if the incentive system is not fully implemented. Due to national fiscal&#13;
difficulties, a few provinces might attempt to use the incentive funds for other&#13;
uses unless proper control and accountability are fully implemented;&#13;
*  Various political forces might resist rationalization of institutions. Others may&#13;
oppose the implementation of firmer policies for teacher education hiring and&#13;
deployment along with the stricter work criteria all part of the a national&#13;
teacher strategy that would increase responsiveness to actual needs while&#13;
increasing cost-effectiveness; and&#13;
*  Past project experience shows that implementation of agreed policies is&#13;
difficult and time consuming in Sri Lanka. However, based on the consensus&#13;
reached and as a result of the substantial participation and intensive technical&#13;
dialogue undertaken during project preparation, it is estimated that these risks&#13;
have been reduced. Nevertheless, the project is likely to suffer, as other&#13;
projects, from the cumbersome bureaucracy and potential implementation&#13;
50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
delays experienced by all projects in Sri Lanka. Government has already&#13;
demonstrated its intent to address the administrative and staff issues by the&#13;
appointment of the project coordination Director in December 1995.&#13;
4.12  The Government recognizes that ignoring or avoiding the issues in teacher&#13;
education would be worse than attempting the changes proposed. MEHE's efforts to date&#13;
have demonstrated a willingness to tackle policy concerns. These efforts suggest that the&#13;
risks are worth taking and that there is political and professional will for the project to be&#13;
implemented on schedule.&#13;
51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.   Agreements Reached and Recommendation&#13;
General Agreements&#13;
5.1    During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on the&#13;
following points:&#13;
a)    That MEHE and provincial authorities shall gradually increase the overall the&#13;
student:teacher ratio so as to ensure that by January 1, 2001 the said ratio has&#13;
reached 26:1 for primary schools and 22:1 for secondary schools (para. 2.6).&#13;
b)    To earmark, on or about January 1, 1997: (i) 3 percent of the annual recurrent&#13;

Association shall agree: (i) a Teacher Cadre Committee, and (ii) NATE, both with&#13;
membership, powers and responsibilities satisfactory to the Association; and&#13;
(b) thereafter maintain and operate the Cadre Committee and NATE (paras. 2.9&#13;
and 2.14).&#13;
d)    That it undertakes, commencing January 1, 1997 to: (a) recruit and assign teachers&#13;
only in accordance with the revised Ready Reckoner formula and Cadre&#13;
Comnittee allocations directly linked to the annual budget and that special or&#13;
emergency appointments of teachers will only follow the application of the said&#13;
formula; and (b) that the application of the Ready Reckoner formula will be&#13;
monitored annually by the Government and any deviation therefrom promptly&#13;
corrected and notice thereof given to the Association (para. 2.10 and 2.21).&#13;
e)    That it shall no later than January 1, 1998, commence the application of a teacher&#13;
support and incentives system satisfactory to the Association to facilitate teacher&#13;
assignments in less favorable areas through the Teacher Transfer Boards (Para.&#13;
2.12).&#13;
f)    That it will carry-out until the completion of the Project, a staff development plan for&#13;
teacher educators, satisfactory to the Association, in accordance with criteria&#13;
satisfactory to the Association for the selection, bonding, and assignment and&#13;
reassignment of trainees (para. 2.23).&#13;
52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
g)    That it will: (a) by January 1, 1998 formulate and furnish to the Association for its-&#13;
concurrence, a system of unit cost budgetary allocation for teacher training&#13;
institutions; and (b) by January 1, 1999 commence the implementation of such&#13;
system.(para. 2.30).&#13;

project in accordance with terms of reference and time schedules satisfactory to&#13;
the Association (para. 3.15).&#13;
i)    That it will maintain until the completion of the project the PCU with terms of&#13;
references satisfactory to the Association, which shall be responsible for the overall&#13;
implementation of the project (para. 3.25);&#13;
j)     That by January 1, 1997 and every six months thereafter, throughout the Project&#13;
execution period, update and furnish the Association for its review and approval&#13;
the implementation plan and key indicators for the project [para. 3.27 (c)].&#13;
k)    That it will:, (a) maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor&#13;
and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with benchmarks and indicators&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, the carrying out of the Project and the achievement&#13;
of the objectives thereof, (b) prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, and furnish the Association, by July 31, 1998: (i) a report integrating&#13;
the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities of the project during the&#13;
period preceding the date of the said report and setting measures recommended to&#13;
ensure the efficient carrying out of the project during the period following that&#13;
date. a specific report detailing the application of the Ready Reckoner formula and&#13;
whether the Teacher Cadre Committee, transfer policy, allocation of funds in each&#13;
province for quality inputs and school maintenance have reached the targets set&#13;
and are operating in a manner satisfactory to the Association; and (c) review with&#13;
the Association, by September 30, 1998 or such later date as the Association shall&#13;
request, the progress reports and take all measures to ensure the efficient&#13;
completion of the project [para. 3.27(d)].&#13;
5.3    Recommendation&#13;
Subject to the above understandings and conditions, the proposed project provides&#13;
a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 44.0 million (US$ 64.1 million) on standard IDA&#13;
terms for 40 years maturity to the Government of Sri Lanka.&#13;

* Part 1 includes details on the Ready Reckoner entitlement formula;&#13;
* Part 2 (pages 1-4) and the second includes an illustration of the mechanism of the Ready Reckoner&#13;
applications, the connections to the budget allocation, and the relationship to teacher demand and&#13;
supply (page 5);&#13;

* Part 7 monitoring steps for the RR and quality inputs; and&#13;
* Part 8 which includes an illustration of the mechanisms of the Ready Reckoner applications, the&#13;
connections to the budget allocation, and the relationship to teacher demand and supply.&#13;
Part I - BACKGROUND: In 1983, the Ministry of Education issued a comprehensive set of Guidelines on&#13;
Teaching Staff Requirements, using a formula - generally referred to as the Ready Reckoner (RR). The policy,&#13;
which applies to all schools, is designed to ensure optimum and equitable deployment and utilisation of available&#13;
teachers. Some minor modifications were made in 1990.&#13;
School staffing entitlements are calculated separately for:&#13;
* the number of students in the Primary Cycle (Kg-G5);&#13;
* the number of students in the Secondary Cycle (G6-1 1);&#13;
* the number of classes in the Collegiate Cycle (G12-13).&#13;
It is the responsibility of the principal of each school to calculate the number of teachers needed and to complete&#13;
and forward the requisite forms to the Divisional Office. Forms are sent to MEHE for collation and verification.&#13;
Details of school entitlements are then forwarded to Provincial Education Offices. Representations may be made to&#13;
MERE to review the allocation to a school or schools in a province. Actual numbers allocated under the RR for&#13;
each province are submitted to the Finance Commission by MEHE as the basis for determining the teacher salary&#13;
component of the block grants. A revised process has been developed for implementation in conjunction with the&#13;
MIS system to be introduced in 1996.&#13;
FACTORS AFFECTING ALLOCATIONS: Specific factors that have been taken into account in developing&#13;
and applying the RR include:&#13;
Primary&#13;
* class size is 30;&#13;
* grade 1 and 2 have 25 contact hours per week (5 per day), grades 3-5 have 30 contact hours per week (6 per&#13;
day);&#13;
* a primary teacher nornally teaches 35 periods (out of a weeldy total of 40 periods) the remaining 5 periods&#13;
being for the teaching of English (by a specialist teacher);&#13;
* special provision is made for small primary schools with enrolments below 50 (e.g., a school with 25 students&#13;
will have 3 staff - principal, teacher, and specialist English teacher).&#13;
56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Secondary&#13;
* class size is 35;&#13;
* grades 6-11 have 30 contact hours per week (6 per day);&#13;
* a secondary teacher normally teaches 32 periods (out of a weeldy total of 40 periods).&#13;
Collegiate&#13;
* grades 12-13 have 30 contact hours per week (6 per day);&#13;
* collegiate class size is normally 25-30 students - smaller classes may be formed (minimum of 15 students)&#13;
where students are unable to attend a larger school within a 5 mile radius, the number of teachers being 3 (one&#13;
for each stream);&#13;
* staffing is based on one teacher per class;&#13;
* a collegiate teacher normally teaches 32 periods (out of a weekly total of 40 periods);&#13;
* grade 13 students are allowed to repeat the year, but are not permitted to attend school on a regular basis - such&#13;
students are not taken into account in calculating staff entitlements.&#13;
OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING ALLOCATIONS: Regardless of size, all schools have a principal and a&#13;
teacher(s) of English, in addition to the normal staff entitlement. See Note 1, below.&#13;
There is no teaching allocation for principals, regardless of the size of the school.&#13;
Depending on the size of the school, provision is made for sectional heads, an assistant principal, and a deputy&#13;
principal. Teaching responsibilities for supervisory positions are as follows:&#13;
* Subject Co-ordinator: 10 hours per week;&#13;
* Grade Co-ordinator: 15 hours per week;&#13;
* Supervisors: 10 hours per week;&#13;
* Assistant Principal: 7 hours per week.&#13;
An additional teacher is allocated to schools with an enrolment of 500+ in grades 6-11.&#13;
Schools do not have administrative or clerical support. Teachers assigned to provide such support may be relieved&#13;
of part or all of their teaching duties. It is generally acknowledged that this is an inappropriate use of teaching&#13;
staff and that the strategy is not cost-effective.&#13;
STUDENT:TEACHER RATIOS - 1993: Based on the 1993 census, the overall STR was 24.1 (or 22.6 with the&#13;
inclusion of non teaching positions in the teaching service). The breakdown by cycle and medium of instruction&#13;
was as follows:&#13;
CYCLE          SINHALA          TAMIL           TOTAL&#13;
Primary          26.4             37.3            28.7&#13;
Secondary         21.2             27.1           22.2&#13;
Collegiate        13.3             16.1            13.7&#13;
Total           22.6             31.1           24.1&#13;
In order to address the imbalance between Sinhala and Tamil STRs, the Government has approved the&#13;
appointment of 5,000 additional teaching positions for Tamil medium schools. These should be effective from the&#13;
beginning of 1996. The effect of these appointments will be to decrease the Tamil STR. At the same time, as&#13;
appointments to Sinhala medium schools have been limited to COE graduates, the Sinhala STR should show an&#13;
increase in 1996, albeit marginally.&#13;
Part 2 - ADulications:&#13;
A. Primary Cycle&#13;
57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Target: that the overall long-term national STR target for the primary cycle be set at 27:1.&#13;
* that the staff allocation for primary schools (other than smaller schools) be on the basis of one&#13;
teacher for every 35 students enrolled in the school (ie., as for secondary) with the&#13;
minimnum/maximum for teacher entitlement being 16 and 45, respectively.&#13;
* that in schools with an enrolment of less than 400, principals have a teaching allocation, the extent&#13;
of this being related to the size of the school. (See Note 1, below.)&#13;
* that for schools with enrolments under 25 the number of staff be reduced from 3 to 2 (principal and&#13;
one other teacher with competence in teaching of English). Comparable adjustments should be made&#13;
for other smaller schools. (See Note 2, below.)&#13;
Options for the organisation of small schools include:&#13;
* Multi-grade teaching - combining classes (e.g., grades 1-3; 4-5, depending on the numbers);&#13;
* Staggered intakes: - intake every alternate year - Year X would have grades 1, 3, 5, followed by year Y with&#13;
grades 2 and 4 (depending on the size of classes, in Year X I and 3 or 3 and 5 could be combined;&#13;
* Family grouping: students are formed into one "class" (school) and then grouped according to age and/or&#13;
ability for different subjects (e.g., maths would require a group arrangement; music would be a "class" (school)&#13;
activity.&#13;
Schools, in consultation with their community, could determine which option is best suited to their particular&#13;
circumsLance, and within the staff allocation.&#13;
*   that the fornation of composite classes be regarded as the norm rather than the exception, it being&#13;
recognised that such classes would normally have fewer students (say 28) than single classes within&#13;
a school.&#13;
*   Staff development (initial and continuing) would be required. Also, attention would need to be given&#13;
to the provision of appropriate teaching and learning materials for small schools.&#13;
B. Secondary Cyde (including Collegiate):&#13;
Targ b: that the overall national STR for the secondary cycle (including collegiate) be set at 22:1.&#13;
*   that the staffing allocation for secondary schools (other than smaller schools) be on the basis of one&#13;
teacher for every 35 students enrolled in the school, with the teaching allocation for different subjects&#13;
within the school being calculated using a weighted system (based on subject periods per week for&#13;
each grade and staff contact hours). (See Note 3, below.)&#13;
*   that the principals of smaller schools have teaching responsibilities, the actual number of periods&#13;
being determined in relation to the size of the school.&#13;
* that the number of relief periods allocated to supervisory staff be reviewed, having particular regard&#13;
to the size of the school and the number of such positions in a given school.&#13;
* that all teachers be required to teach major and minor subjects.&#13;
* that teacher contact hours continue to be monitored in accordance with the current regulations to&#13;
ensure that teachers have a period loading of at least 32 periods per week.&#13;
* that in the smaller secondary schools, the number of options be limited to accord with staffing&#13;
efficiencies. Government should not depart from current policy whereby core subjects are taught in&#13;
all schools and the number of options increases with the size of the school. The viability of smaller&#13;
secondary schools should continue to be monitored with a view to the amalgamations to improve&#13;
quality, the general international view being that the effective operation of a secondary school&#13;
requires at least 2 streams per grade.&#13;
C. Administrative Support:&#13;
* that consideration be given to the provision of administrative/clerical support for larger schools.&#13;
This would be done in the context of reviewing the teaching requirements for principals and&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
supervisozy staff. The support allocation would be on a part or full time basis, depending on the size&#13;
and complexity of the school. See Note 4, below.&#13;
Notes:&#13;
1. For example, non-teaching entitlements could be as follows: &lt; 50 students: equivalent of one day per week (for&#13;
administrative duties); &lt;100 students: 1.5 days; &lt;200 students: 2 days; &lt;300 students: 3 days; &lt;400 students: 4&#13;
days per week; &gt;400: full time release. All principals should remain in contact with students and have a&#13;
minimum 4 hours teaching, per week. (See also Note 4 on administrative support.)&#13;
2. The allocation of specialist teachers of English lowers the STR. Such an allocation cannot be justified unless the&#13;
teachers are adequately trained to teach English. (The allocation needs to be reviewed on the basis that there is a&#13;
lack of evidence that students are in fact learning English and that the staffing of schools of less than 50 students at&#13;
an STR of under 20:1 is not cost-effective. Accordingly, alternative staffing assignments should be assessed.)&#13;
3. Staff allocations for specific disciplines would be based on a weighted system involving the number of periods&#13;
for each discipline for each grade and the number of teacher contact hours.&#13;
4. In the case of administrative support, Government should consider the employment of secretarial staff rather&#13;
than the more costly alternative of assigning teachers to clerical duties.&#13;
Part 3 Aireements Reached: The following principles were accepted:&#13;
* that there be a change in the targets for the Ready Reckoner, the objective being to decrease teacher demand,&#13;
without jeopardising quality;&#13;
* that there be a gradual increase in the overall national student:staff ratios with a view to achieving a 27:1 STR&#13;
for primary and 22:1 STR for secondary (provinces to be responsive to these targets within 1-3 years by&#13;
adjusting actual staffing in schools, with ratios for entitlement increasing annually to an agreed threshold and&#13;
thereafter continued).&#13;
* that the RR be applied consistently to all provinces, as per the intention of the original Guidelines; (See Note 5,&#13;
below.)&#13;
i that teacher salary allocations to provinces/authorities be based on the actual cadre entitlement, as calculated&#13;
under the Ready Reckoner, with a margin of some 2% to cover unexpected exigencies;&#13;
* that the recently approved National Policy on Teachers Transfers be implemented consistently from the&#13;
beginning of 1996.&#13;
* intake to the existing and new NCOEs should follow the institutions plan provided in Annex 22A taking into&#13;
consideration the designed capacity under the project (to match demand);&#13;
* recruitment of graduate teachers would be the last resort and carried out only after and in co-ordination with&#13;
efforts in re-training some of the surplus existing teachers while filling the shortages based on subject needs;&#13;
* place a ceiling 750 on graduate teacher recruitment (made-up of 400 trained university graduates with PG&#13;
diplomas and 350 untrained university graduates for special subject needs following prerequisite short-term&#13;
training of 3 months). This will involve the gradual increase of PG diploma and a limited of Bed graduates to&#13;
reach an all trained graduate system intake of 750 by year 2003; and&#13;
* intake into university post graduate diploma should be according to subject needs identified by the provinces,&#13;
consolidated by MEHE, and transmitted to the universities by NATE&#13;
Part 4 School Consolidation Tar=et:&#13;
A. Primary level to consolidate the teaching establishments (to be added as mid-term benchmarks) are:&#13;
* Consolidation of smaller schools with less than 35 students, where practicable. This initiative is expected to&#13;
remove some 750 positions from the teaching cadre. It is not expected that all schools in this category will be&#13;
rationalised; there is a projected balance of 250 teachers who will be required to staff the remaining smaller&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
schools. The rationalization process will be gradual. It is expected that all 750 positions will be vacated by&#13;
1999-2000. The Minister has approved MEHE proceeding with this strategy.&#13;
&#149;  Special English teachers will be phased out of smaller primary schools over a period of some 3-4 years as&#13;
primary teachers are trained to teach all subjects, including English. This will remove an estimated 500&#13;
positions from the teaching cadre by 1999-2000. This proposal is to be submitted for approval shortly.&#13;
*  Schools with fewer than 5 teachers will not be allocated a non-teaching principal position. This initiative will&#13;
impact on some 1,850 principals positions in the administrative cadre. These positions will be gradually&#13;
phased out as the current occupants are relocated. This proposal has been approved by the Minister.&#13;
*  The implementation of the above strategies will have a medium to long term impact on the teaching service&#13;
establishment, resulting in an overall decrease of some 3,100 positions ( 1,250 teaching positions and 1,850&#13;
administrative positions in schools). A decrease in the actual number of teachers will be realised through&#13;
attrition.&#13;
B. Secondary Schools (to be added as mid-term benchmarks) would involve the following:&#13;
* Consolidation of the number of small secondary A level classes with 15 or less students with provision of&#13;
scholarships for students to attend other schools, if necessary. There is a total of 850 schools with 4,500&#13;
teachers in this category. The rationalization initiative is expected to remove some 3,000 positions from the&#13;
teaching cadre, with the actual decrease in the number of teachers being absorbed through attrition. MEHE is&#13;
currently undertaking a census and expects to begin implementing rationalization in 1997 and extending over&#13;
2-3 years. The current status is that the MEHE Minister has approved the plan.&#13;
*  Consolidation of the number of small secondary schools with less than 35 students. Some 500 schools with&#13;
1,350 teachers are in this category. The initiative is expected to remove some 750 positions from the teaching&#13;
cadre. MEHE is currently undertaking a census and expects to begin implementing rationalization in 1997 and&#13;
extending over 2-3 years. The current status is that the MEHE Minister has approved the plan.&#13;
Part 5 Oualitv InDuts: Quality inputs would be:&#13;
* second series of textbooks and library books;&#13;
* Renoe Duplicating machines;&#13;
* Tool kits;&#13;
* consumables for science, mathematics, language instruction;&#13;
* maps and globes;&#13;
* audio visual equipment such as projectors etc. including slides, overheads and films;&#13;
* photocopier and office and staff equipment (i.e. staplers, guillotines, drawing and other similar&#13;
materials for art, science and environmental activities;&#13;
* funds for short workshops, seminars and training sessions as approved by the authorities;&#13;
*   minor maintenance in schools and purchase of emergency materials as light bulbs etc.; and&#13;
* consumables for authorised subjects.&#13;
Part 6 Incentives: The plan would be based on the newly-formulated categorisation of schools into four groups,&#13;
according to degrees of hardship. This plan would:&#13;
* differential allowances based on the degree of hardships (15% of salary in most difficult schools and&#13;
10% in difficult plus educational material support);&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*   differential location allowances on an escalating basis corresponding to the years of service in a&#13;
particular location;&#13;
*   consideration of years of service in less favourable schools to be used as one of the main criteria for&#13;
transfer to more favourable schools;&#13;
* support for teacher travel and housing (local standards);&#13;
* special provision to facilitate teacher access to study opportunities, including payment of partial to&#13;
full fees and assistance with travel to study centres; and&#13;
* support for the education of the teacher's children where there is no secondary school available&#13;
locally.&#13;
Part 7 Monitorin SteDs: The monitoring steps for the RR and quality inputs would be:&#13;
*   present staffing per school/district/zone and province based on the cadre analysis as completed by&#13;
MEBE during year one of the project. A survey identifying the essential needs by subject and&#13;
classroom would be undertaken during the first six months of the project and thereafter justifications&#13;
on the meeting of such target would have to be demonstrated annually;&#13;
*   the actual cadre would be revised on an annual basis to meet enrolments. Once the cadre matched&#13;
the proposed STR of 27:1 at primary and 22:1 at secondary new goals and long-term national goal of&#13;
30:1 and 25:1 would be set;&#13;
* the transfer policy would be implemented annually transferring teachers first from overstaffed to&#13;
understaffed schools within a district/zone/province. Annually about three months prior to school&#13;
opening the surplus teachers from the various provinces would be submitted to the Transfer Board&#13;
for re-assignment to other provinces to fill vacancies. At the secondary and upper primary levels&#13;
efforts should be to have, within a period of about three years, teachers match the subject needs.&#13;
Each school/district/zone should have a plan to match subject needs. The plan would be verified&#13;
annually as part of the RR review;&#13;
*   Provinces would have to report annually and present the following: a list of quality inputs awarded&#13;
school by school with these inputs matching the following goals: 3% in 1997; 4% in 1998; 5% in&#13;
1999; and 6% in year 2000. Administrative units not meeting the target would have to justify the&#13;
reasons and if they continued not to match the national quality needs, alternative ways to deliver&#13;
these quality needs to the schools could be considered to ensure equitable allocation of quality goods&#13;
to all the students. Quality inputs would be based on: student unit costs by grade and by level. A&#13;
quality allocation would also be made for each teacher by level.&#13;
*   The monitoring activities would determine how the staff and administrator numbers could be made&#13;
to fit the cadre. At the start of the project each unit that was understaffed would be given the needed&#13;
staff to fit the cadre. Each under staffed unit would have to submit a plan on how they could reach&#13;
the cadre. The over staffed school/district/zone and province units would have to submit a plan, with&#13;
a maximum of three years, showing how they would reduce their staff to arrive at the recommended&#13;
cadre; and&#13;
*   these target would be adjusted annually to respond to actual needs and specific priorities. Certain&#13;
essential targets to meet would be: no. of textbooks; no. of library books; adequate chalkboards;&#13;
adequate supply of chalk and essential supplies; availability of writing materials for the students;&#13;
adequacy of science and mathematics materials; resource materials for social studies, language and&#13;
other subject teaching (these would be established by NIE during the first six months of the project);&#13;
desk and seats for all the children; required sports equipment; adequate drinking and washing&#13;
facilities; etc. These goals would be reviewed about every second year to ensure standards and&#13;
adequate supply of essential materials and quality inputs in the schools. A main target would also be&#13;
to increase equity among all the schools to increase the learning opportunities of particularly the&#13;
rural, slum area and poor children.&#13;

National Policy on Teachers Transfers&#13;
The Goverrunent has decided to formulate a National Policy on Teachers Transfers with a view to&#13;
ensuring the implementation of the educational activities meaningfully and providing for the maximum welfare&#13;
and benefit of the student and teacher population. The Cabinet of Ministers has decided that the National Policy&#13;
should be based on the following criteria:&#13;
1. Since education should be pupil centered the needs of the pupils should be given priority on all occasions.&#13;
2. Since the improvement of the quality of education depends on the knowledge and the skills of the teachers,&#13;
the policy on teachers transfers should promote the development of skills and knowledge in teachers.&#13;
3. The policy on teachers transfers should be formulated in a manner to ensure the professional security,&#13;
academic freedom and the job satisfaction of the teachers and should provide for the teachers to serve with a&#13;
considerable degree of confidence without the fear of being transferred out unjustifiably.&#13;
4. One of the main objectives of this policy should be to minimize the regional discrepancies observed in the&#13;
process of education.&#13;
5. The policy on transfers should ensure an equitable distribution of the human resources in the field of&#13;
education so as to make such scarce resources available to the public at the periphery.&#13;
6. Such policy should lead to the maximum utilization of the scarce human resource available in the sector&#13;
through a proper management of resources.&#13;
7. Other than in the instances where a transfer is made to facilitate the procedure when disciplinary action is&#13;
being taken or is being contemplated against a teacher, all transfers of teachers should be made on a&#13;
recommendation made by a duly constituted teachers transfer board.&#13;
8. Transfers of teachers should be effected only on the recommendations of a duly constituted transfer board&#13;
other than in the cases where disciplinary action is being take or is being contemplated against a teacher and&#13;
where transfers are made on a request by a teacher for reasons of ill-health and on exigencies of service. The&#13;
transfer boards should be informed of any transfers made on exigencies of service within a period of 2 weeks&#13;
from the date of the letter effecting the transfer.&#13;
9. Teachers transfer boards should be established at the following levels:&#13;
*  Zonal Education Office.&#13;
*  Provincial/Additional Provincial Education Office.&#13;
*  Line Ministry. In addition to the members of the teachers transfer boards to be appointed in terms of Section&#13;
5 of Chapter Ill of Establishments Code, a representative of every Teachers Union registered under the Trade&#13;
Unions Ordinance and whose membership is serving in more than one Province in the Island should be&#13;
appointed as members of the transfer board.&#13;
10. Classification of Schools - The Schools are classified as given below:&#13;
*  Very congenial&#13;
*  Congenial&#13;
*  Non-congenial&#13;
*  Difficult&#13;
11. The line Ministry in consultation with the Provincial Ministries of Education shall classify the schools as per&#13;
above.&#13;
65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12. Time Schedule - Other than in the cases specified under para 2 above, the transfers of teachers should be&#13;
effected only at the beginning of a calendar year with a view to minimizing inconveniences caused to the students&#13;
and the teachers.&#13;

certificate of a specialist in the respective field and the clinic cards. The risk factors approved by the World&#13;
Health Organization shall be accepted as valid reasons for transfers on reasons of ill-health in the case of&#13;
expectant mothers. In addition to the personal health of the teacher concerned, the health of the following&#13;
members of the family of the teacher may be taken into consideration.&#13;
*   Spouse.&#13;
-   Children.&#13;
*   Dependent parents if the teacher is not married&#13;

TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness of Teacher Education Programs&#13;
1      Over one third (69,000) of the teachers in Sri Lanka are attending some kind of training program&#13;
and the large majority (81 percent) of these are enrolled in training through the distance education mode&#13;
Distance education and part-time programs at NIE and the universities cover about 59,000 teachers&#13;
(Figure 1).&#13;

Program Costs: The cost of all teacher training programs was estimated at Rs 206 million in 1994,&#13;
representing 6 percent of the education recurrent budget. Table I and Figure 2 show that NIE has the&#13;
largest share (42%) followed by Colleges of Education (COEs), Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) and&#13;
the universities. However, the magnitude and distribution of costs become quite different with the&#13;
inclusion of additional costs such as trainees full salaries in TTCs, student stipends in COEs. The total&#13;
cost almost doubles when these expenditures are added to reach Rs. 366 million representing 10% of the&#13;
sectoral budget. The TTC share increased substantially to 48 percent and both the TTC and COE cost&#13;
amounted to 70 percent of all program costs even though they train 11 percent of all trainees, while NIE&#13;
with 24 percent of costs, trains 81 percent of the trainees (Figure 3).&#13;

2.      Program Unit Cost: Cost analysis among different programns is based on unit cost estimnates of&#13;
expenditure per trainee in the teacher training institutions. It is difficult to estimate the unit cost on the&#13;
bases of equivalent full-time students as the mixture of full-time, and part-time distance education training&#13;
modies across different types of institutions precludes the determination of a uniform base. However, the&#13;
difference in the programs' unit costs is so vast that a refinement would not change the scale of such&#13;
variations.&#13;
3.      The expenditure per student in the TTCs is by far the largest followed by the COEs, the&#13;
universities, and then by NIE (Figure 4). The unit cost differentials are usually attributed to several&#13;
factors such as program type, duration, equipment used, staff deployment, and mode of delivery.&#13;
However, the substantially high UC of the TTCs is due to the massive cost of trainee salaries which&#13;
represents more than two thirds of the TTCs' total cost. Funding policies for institutions are unclear and&#13;
appear to bear no consistent relationship to actual enrollments or the number of staff actually required in a&#13;
given year.&#13;

4.      Cost Implications of Residential Facilities: The policy of providing residential services to all&#13;
trainees of the COEs and most of the trainees in the TTCs is very expensive. The isolated location of&#13;
teacher training institutions increases the costs of all the services and makes staffing more difficult and&#13;
70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
costly. For example, expenditure related to the residential facilities in one of the COEs represented over&#13;
50% of the total institution's recurrent budget. This residential isolation also makes the necessary&#13;
integration of future teachers into the community more difficult. Residential facilities increase overhead&#13;
expenditure and require substantial resources for running costs and salaries of additional service workers.&#13;
A vast segment of the cost comes from the large number of non-academic staff and service workers in&#13;
these institutions, who are required to support and maintain these facilities. The ratio of academic to non-&#13;
academic staff in 1994 was 1:1 in the TTCs and 1:3 in the COEs.&#13;
5.      Under-utilization of the residential facilities in these institutions adds to the overall costs and&#13;
increases their unit cost. In 1994, the COEs, which offer residential facilities to all their first and second&#13;
year students, only used 74% of this residential capacity (third year students do their internship year in&#13;
schools). Capacity utilization rates vary substantially among the COEs. Similar variations in capacity&#13;
utilization are found in the TTCs. Some of the institutions in remote and rural areas, which were&#13;
established under political pressure, have very low rates of utilization and are run with high operating&#13;
costs. As in other Asian countries, Sri Lanka needs to develop a plan for the relocation of teacher training&#13;
institutions to increase cost-effectiveness, reduce boarding according to needs and increase lower-cost day&#13;
students.&#13;
6.      High Cost of Low Student:Staff Ratio: The low student:staff ratio in the TTCs and the COEs&#13;
was 9:1 and 13:1, respectively, in 1994 (which declined further in 1995) increases overhead expenses and&#13;
inflates the unit cost of these institutions. In addition, the large number of non-academic staff, required&#13;
mainly for the residential services offered to the trainees, adds substantially to the recurrent costs of these&#13;
institutions. In addition, the facilities of the COEs and TTCs which carry out pre- and in-service training&#13;
programs, respectively, are under-utilized and inefficiently managed.&#13;
7.      High Cost of Trainees Salaries and Stipends: The current policy of offering payment of full&#13;
salary to the TTCs trainees and stipends to COEs students is very expensive and adds substantially to the&#13;
budget. In 1994, the teacher education system cost with student salaries and stipends (Rs 366 million) is&#13;
almost double the cost without these salaries and stipends. When salaries of trainees are added to the&#13;
training cost, the TTCs recurrent expenditure increases by almost four times and reaches Rs 175 million&#13;
and its share to the cost of all programs increases from 22% to 48%.&#13;
8.      There are no studies on assessment of the private costs of training (e.g. fees, books,&#13;
transportation, lodging). Stipends are paid universally and independently of such costs. As a result, it is&#13;
difficult to assess whether the students are receiving more or less than they actually spend for training.&#13;
The system does not include policies and measures to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the training&#13;
programs on the bases of actual cost to the Government and to the trainee.&#13;
9.      Unit Cost Variation among Institutions: There is a vast discrepancy in unit costs within TTCs&#13;
and COEs. For example, the unit cost of TTCs in the Southern Province is more than three times the unit&#13;
cost of the TTCs in North Western Province. The differences in the unit cost are partly attributed to&#13;
different level and type of equipment, facilities, and laboratories in these institutions. Institutions&#13;
specialized in math, science, and English training have different types of equipment and require&#13;
specialized teachers who are usually paid higher salaries and allowances.&#13;
10.    InceTicient Institutional Management: These discrepancies in the institutions' unit cost are&#13;
further accentuated by differences in the utilization of residential and other facilities. Training of the&#13;
COEs and TTCs management has been limited and has not focused on cost-effectiveness and how to&#13;
maximize the utilization of facilities, staff and other resources in the institution. Furthermore, the absence&#13;
of a special formula based on standard criteria for resource distribution and funding has led to the&#13;
institutions' annual budgets not reflecting their real requirements and consequently some institutions&#13;
receive more and others less than their needs. The undesirable practice of relying on untrained teachers to&#13;
fill vacancies, primarily at the secondary level, needs to be reviewed and professional criteria established&#13;
71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for entry into the service at both primary and secondary levels. The goal of the project is to establish by&#13;
year 2,000 a fully pre-service and pre-trained teacher supplied system. This has the implication that pre-&#13;
employment of teacher trainees will have to be stopped and that teachers should be employed on the basis&#13;
of demand.&#13;
11.    Within each institution, management is less effective than it should be. Selection criteria for&#13;
heads of institutions do not emphasize leadership or experience in teacher education. Training in&#13;
management is not required prior to appointment. The structure of the institutions is not conducive to&#13;
sharing responsibility or team functioning, which could be beneficial for managing such environments. If&#13;
teacher education is to become a vital force within the country, appropriate appointments of heads and&#13;
senior staff and a planned program of staff development are essential in developing strong leadership.&#13;
12.    Other Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, have rationalized their&#13;
teacher training institutions on cost-effective bases by consolidation of institutions, establishment of&#13;
centralized multi-disciplinary institutions with residential service only for targeted students, contracting&#13;
some of the support services to the private sector, introducing some user fees with safety nets for the&#13;
poorer students, and maintaining a student:staff ratio that is based on full utilization of their staff&#13;
(averaging about 20:1). These measures have reduced unit costs thereby contributing to the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of the system. Sri Lanka needs to also implement such measures.&#13;
13.    Cost Effectiveness of Distance Education: The distance education program for teacher&#13;
education was introduced as a cost-effective approach to clear the backlog of untrained teachers. The&#13;
program for untrained undergraduates has been supported by SIDA. Providing there is no further massive&#13;
appointment of untrained undergraduate teachers, the backlog should be cleared by the end of 1998.&#13;
However, the trained teachers with only a certificate will need to be upgraded to diploma level. The&#13;
knowledge and experience in distance mode should be used for that purpose in the future. The backlog of&#13;
untrained graduates is currently being addressed through the universities and NIE Departments of&#13;
Teacher Education. There are no reliable data on the number of graduates who have yet to complete the&#13;
post graduate diploma program. Until the preservice P.G. Dip Ed. becomes effective, there will be a&#13;
number of untrained graduates (albeit greatly reduced) entering the service without a professional&#13;
qualification.&#13;
14.    The massive number of distance education students enrolled in NIE has resulted in a relatively&#13;
low unit cost and consequently little attention is paid to the cost of repetition and to examination&#13;
outcomes. Around 20 percent of the distance education students do not sit for the examination within the&#13;
planned time and there are no official data on what happens to those students. Monitoring as well as&#13;
follow up activities need to be strengthened.&#13;
15.    Minimum attention is given to the output cost (cost per qualified teacher) i.e. partial and&#13;
complete failure at the terminal examinations, number of students not sitting for finals, and attrition from&#13;
courses. Course drop-out represents a high cost to the sector and inflates the resources required to provide&#13;
an adequate and qualified teacher. In addition, recent impressions are that the teachers trained by means&#13;
of distance education are weaker than teachers trained at COEs in their teaching practice. However, the&#13;
distance education program has produced some very valuable training units/modules and these should not&#13;
be lost but integrated into the pre-service programs. The use of most distance training modules should be&#13;
sustained and extended to other programs through structured continuous teacher training programs.&#13;
16.    Distance Education Dependence on Foreign Financing: The distance education program at&#13;
NIM depends heavily on foreign assistance in its financing. Almost 78 percent of the Rs 66 million total&#13;
program cost is provided by SIDA. SIDA is currently financing primary basic certificate level math and&#13;
science courses. However, SIDA plans to cover only primary courses by next year and to phase out all the&#13;
program by 1998 when the major part of the backlog of untrained teachers would be cleared. SIDA will&#13;
continue to support continuing education for teachers by means of distance education.&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17.    Complications of University Teacher Education Cost: The overall unit cost of university&#13;
education programs (Rs 4,000) is quite low compared with training in the TlCs (Rs 14,000) and COEs&#13;
(Rs 12,000). However, financial reporting of university teacher education programs is complicated by&#13;
courses being combined with other faculties and by costs of research and post-graduate courses which&#13;
make it difficult to separate cost of full-time and part-time courses and to assess equivalent full-time&#13;
student costs. It is also difficult to obtain accurate data on input for staff who are not specifically&#13;
dedicated to teacher education programs. Further, there are proportionate costs for administration, library&#13;
and other services which technically could be attributed to the recurrent cost of teacher education&#13;
programs. These factors deflate the unit cost and reduce overall costs.&#13;
18.    High Private Cost of University Teacher Education: Private costs of university programs&#13;
(which are at post-graduate level) are by far the largest in relation to other teacher training programs. For&#13;
example, students at the Faculty of Education at Colombo University pay Rs 800 per year for registration,&#13;
tuition, examination, and field work fees. Students who are enrolled in the part-time Diploma program at&#13;
the regional centers have to pay Rs 4,500 fee per year. However, the Provinces pay students back half of&#13;
that fee from the block grants they receive. These expenses bring the total private cost to about Rs 4,200&#13;
per year and this represents 7 percent of the annual average salary of the teacher.&#13;

Mr. Joseph Wood&#13;
Vice President&#13;
South Asia Regional Office&#13;
World Bank&#13;
Washington, D.C.&#13;
Dear Mr. Wood,&#13;
Re: Teacher Education Policy Statement&#13;
1.     The Government of Sri Lanka is requesting assistance from the International Development&#13;
Association through a Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment Project to better meet critical&#13;
teacher requirements and to upgrade the quality of education. The project will support policy&#13;
reform and related investments in the education sector. This letter outlines the Government's&#13;
policies.&#13;
2.     Sri lanka has had positive, but limited, economic growth over the past decade. At the same&#13;
time, public expenditure has risen by some 6 percent per annum in real terms between 1985-1994.&#13;
A significant proportion of the growth in public expenditure has resulted from an expansion of the&#13;
public service, together with increases in salaries. Growth in the public service has been most&#13;
marked in the teaching profession. The period 1989 to 1994 saw an increase of some 50,000&#13;
teachers, the vast majority of whom were untrained. As a result of this, the quality of the teaching&#13;
service has declined markedly, the student:teacher ratio has decreased from 28:1 in 1989 to 24:1 in&#13;
1994 at the primary level and from 22:1 to 16:1 at the secondary level. The effect of the massive&#13;
recruitment on salary expenditure was immense. Between 1989 and 1993, newly recruited teachers&#13;
added over Rs. 1.2 billion (18 percent) to the total salary expenditure. Notwithstanding the major&#13;
increase in teachers, there are still major shortages in some disciplines and an inequitable&#13;
distribution of teachers across provinces, schools, and language groups. A further problem arises&#13;
from the fact that only some 18 percent of new recruits to teaching are trained before entering the&#13;
service. While significant progress have been made in the training of untrained teachers, through&#13;
the distance mode, which relies heavily on external donor funds, it is recogrnized that this is, at&#13;
best, a remedial approach and that all teachers should be trained before entering the service.&#13;
Regrettably, there are insufficient places and resources within the present system to cater for the&#13;
initial training requirements and inadequate provision for the ongoing continuing education of&#13;
teachers in the service. Moreover, the teacher education system is fragmented and largely&#13;
unresponsive to national needs. While many institutions are overstaffed almost all are in need of&#13;
more suitable facilities and equipment and the equitable distribution of training in the country&#13;
requires improvement.&#13;
75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.     Traditionally, Sri Lanka has been a leader in education in Asia. Participation rates to the&#13;
end of year 10, over 70 percent, are well above neighboring countries. Likewise, Sri Lanka has a&#13;
proud record in providing places for over 80 percent to grade 11. Progression to collegiate level&#13;
(years 12-13) now reaches 15 percent. Further, it is planned to extend compulsory education from&#13;
age 12 to age 16 in 1996. The significance and impact of these achievements has, however, been&#13;
diluted by the over-supply of untrained and often inappropriately assigned teachers. Apart from&#13;
the adverse impact on education quality, the additional funds required to meet the salaries of&#13;
additional teachers have had a negative impact on the provision of suitable quantity and quality of&#13;
student learning materials, equipment, furniture and general maintenance of the infrastructure. The&#13;
shortcomings have been most marked in disadvantaged and remote schools.&#13;
4.     Government has determined that there are two crucial issues which need to be urgently&#13;
addressed within the system: the rationalization of teacher deployment to improve the quality,&#13;
equity, and cost effectiveness of the system; and the restructuring and upgrading of teacher&#13;
education programs. The latter to ensure the availability of trained teachers and to provide for the&#13;
ongoing professional development of all teachers in the service. Government policies are directed&#13;
towards these interrelated goals as a priority. At the same time, given the economic outlook, it is&#13;
recognized that the issues of distributing quality educational materials, increasing equitable&#13;
allocation of resources to all parts of the country and improvements in the administration and of the&#13;
financing mechanisms of the education system should be given early attention. However, unless&#13;
the teacher issues are resolved the impact from these investments could be limited. We note that&#13;
the education budget absorbed about 11 percent of the national budget and the intent is to&#13;
maximize its use in the foreseeable future, through corrective measures that address the above&#13;
listed issues.&#13;
5.    In regard to teacher deployment, the Govenmuent's medium- to long-term objective is to&#13;
ensure that all teachers be trained before entering the teaching service. This will require a marked&#13;
increase in the number of training places. To support this initiative, cost savings will be effected&#13;
through increasing the student:teacher ratios to 26:1 for primary (grades 1-5) and 22:,1 for&#13;
secondary (grades 6-13) by 2001. It is estimated that substantial salary savings could result. In&#13;
addition to meeting part of the cost of the expansion of initial training for teachers, salary savings&#13;
would also be used to provide additional educational materials to all schools and to support&#13;
incentives-for teachers in the "non-congenial" and "difficult" schools.&#13;
6.    In order to ensure a more equitable distribution of teachers, nationally, the Govermnent&#13;
will reactivate the use of the Ready Reckoner formula, as discussed during the IDA appraisal and&#13;
ensure that all future teacher allocations are done annually and based upon that revised formula.&#13;
This will be monitored by the National Cadre Committee with representatives from the Ministry of&#13;
Education and Higher Education, the Ministry of Finance, the Finance Commission and the&#13;
provinces. It will also ensure that the recently introduced National Policy on Teacher Transfers is&#13;
implemented consistently for all teachers. This policy requires that teachers serve a minimum of 4&#13;
years in "non-congenial" and 3 years in "difficult" schools. Moreover, the maximum period that&#13;
teachers can spend in a "very congenial" and a "congenial" schools is 6 and 8 years, respectively.&#13;
As teacher salaries have improved, Government intends to reduce teacher absenteeism and will&#13;
initiate ways to relate unsatisfactory attendance to salary payment.&#13;
7.     As part of the Government's policy on the restructuring of expenditure on salaries,&#13;
financial allocations to provinces will be related directly to cadre entitlements, calculated on the&#13;
76&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
basis of the staffing formulae, rather than the number of staff actually employed from year to year.&#13;
Staffing entitlements and budgetary allocations will be regulated through a representative Cadre&#13;
Committee. Provinces which are overstaffed will be required to reduce the number of teachers to&#13;
accord with the approved cadre. Provinces which are understaffed will be provided with increased&#13;
funding as additional teachers are recruited. The adjustments will be made over a three-year period&#13;
beginning 1997, with the target student:teacher ratios being in place in all provinces by year 2001.&#13;
8.    In regard to the goal of restructuring and upgrading of teachers, the Government will&#13;
implement a number of policy initiatives. The first initiative involves major changes to the&#13;
structure and organization of teacher education, to be addressed on a national level. A National&#13;
Authority on Teacher Education (NATE) will be established, the principal functions being the&#13;
development of national policy, planning and coordination, and the systematic monitoring of&#13;
teacher education, including the accreditation of programs. NATE will be a semi-autonomous&#13;
institution under the Minister of Education and Higher Education. NATE will oversee the national&#13;
integrated system of teacher education, comprising 14 National College of Education (NCOEs), the&#13;
National Institute of Education (NIE), 4 universities and about 80 Teacher Centers (TC- about 78&#13;
type A and 3 type B). The Teacher Centers' principal function will be to service the professional&#13;
development needs of teachers in the field. Teacher Centers will be an integral part of NCOEs&#13;
with provision for the delivery of continuing education courses through the distance mode by both&#13;
NIE and universities. This new organization structure will be introduced in 1996 with the&#13;
establishment of NATE.&#13;
9.    The second major policy initiative relates to the nature and quality of teacher education&#13;
programs. As indicated above, Government will require as a basic employment criterion that all&#13;
teachers entering the service will have completed an accredited initial (pre-service) teacher training&#13;
program. It is acknowledged that from time to time it may be necessary to recruit a limited number&#13;
of untrained teachers to fill emergency vacancies. It is also acknowledged that 750 university&#13;
graduates could be recruited annually according to needs on the bases of 400 trained and 350&#13;
untrained. Even so, the recruits will only be employed, following the application of the Ready&#13;
Reckoner formula and following a minimum three-month intensive course; they will then be&#13;
required to take part-time training, principally through the distance education mode, in order to&#13;
gain their initial qualification. Qualitative improvements in the school system will be further&#13;
advanced through the provision of a comprehensive program of continuing professional&#13;
development for all teachers. This provision accords with the recently approved Teachers Service&#13;
Minute, which requires teachers to participate in planned continuing education courses on a five-&#13;
year cycle. Such courses will be developed through the training institutions and accredited&#13;
nationally through NATE, thereby facilitating transfer of credits among institutions. In order to&#13;
increase the flexibility of staffing for schools, all secondary teachers will be required to be trained&#13;
to teach one major and at least one minor subject. These policy initiatives will become effective in&#13;
1996 and will be monitored on an annual basis.&#13;
10.   The third major policy area, under teacher education, concems staffing levels and staff&#13;
development for personnel involved in teacher education. In order to maximize the use of staff&#13;
resources for teacher education, the minimum student:teacher educator ratio will be set at 15: 1,&#13;
based on equivalent full-time students. This target will be achieved by 1998 when new NCOEs are&#13;
scheduled to be operational. A program for extensive staff development for teacher educators and&#13;
teacher education managers will begin with the development of a comprehensive plan in 1996 and&#13;
will operate throughout the project. The Government's policy calls for an upgrading of academic&#13;
staff, including senior executives, over a five-year period to attain a profile of 10-15% first degree,&#13;
77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35-40% Post Graduate Diploma in Education, 45% Masters and 10% PhDs. Provision will also&#13;
be made for the upgrading of administrative and support staff in institutions. As a further strategy&#13;
for promoting quality, selection criteria relating to academic staff will be developed and applied&#13;
consistently. NATE, in collaboration with training institutions, will develop, in 1996, sets of&#13;
minimum criteria to be applied consistently thereafter during the project. The criteria will cover&#13;
the selection of teacher educators for the professional development program, the appointment of&#13;
heads of institutions, initial appointments to the Teacher Educator Service, and promotion within&#13;
the service. Staff allocations will also be directly linked to enrollments with the number of trainers&#13;
directly related to the trainee:teacher educator ratio of 15:1 and adjusted accordingly on an annual&#13;
basis.&#13;
11.    The rationalization of teacher education institutions is the fourth major policy area which the&#13;
Government will pursue to improve the quality, equity, and cost effectiveness of teacher education. With&#13;
the proposed setting up of 5 new NCOEs and over 80 TCs, the number of existing teacher education&#13;
institutions will be reduced from 31 to 19. In order to expand the number of places for initial training and&#13;
to increase access and the quality of facilities, 5 new NCOEs will be built in strategic locations. These&#13;
together with the upgrading and expansion of 9 existing institutions will give a more equitable&#13;
distribution of institutions across provinces and reduce the proportion of residential places required for&#13;
trainees by one-third. The Govermment is committed to increasing the number of non-residential places&#13;
as a means of attracting a wider range of students and of adjusting the unit cost of training. About 80&#13;
Teacher Centers will be distributed across provinces, having particular regard to demographic and access&#13;
factors to enable teachers to attend day and, where necessary, short residential continuing education&#13;
courses. The centers will be part of the network of NCOEs and will also accommodate the distance&#13;
education delivery requirements of NIE, Open University, and the Universities of Colombo, Peradeniya&#13;
and Jaffna, which will form part of the national integrated system. By refurbishing existing facilities of&#13;
the remaining Colleges of Education, Teachers Training Colleges and Field Study Centers, the need for&#13;
additional capital development will be reduced. The rationalization of institutions is targeted for&#13;
completion by 1998, when the new NCOEs are due to begin operating.&#13;
12.    The strengthening of the management of teacher education constitutes a fifth important&#13;
policy area for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of teacher education. In this area, the&#13;
Govemrnent will support two principal initiatives, the first being the determiination of unit cost of&#13;
different types of prograrns as the basis for establishing realistic budget parameters for training&#13;
institutions. Annual budgets will, therefore, reflect the range of programs offered by a given&#13;
institution and be linked to the number of students within each program. The second policy&#13;
initiative relates to increasing the managerial and financial autonomy of NCOEs, through the&#13;
allocation of an annual budget and a significant extension of the range of delegation for financial&#13;
and general management at the institutional level. The process will begin in 1996 as part of the&#13;
budget analysis, be piloted in 1997 and be applied to all institutions in 1998, with regular&#13;
monitoring and annual reporting to MEHE.&#13;
13.    Finally, Government would implement recent initiatives for rationalization of teacher&#13;
numbers and deployment within non economical circumstances. These measures would include:&#13;
(i) consolidation of smaller primary schools; (ii) training all primary teachers to teach all subjects&#13;
including English; (iii) following training, phasing out of specialist English language teachers in&#13;
smaller primary schools; ( (iv) eliminating the position of principal in schools with five teachers or&#13;
less; (v) consolidating secondary A level classes with 15 or less students in any stream; (vi)&#13;
consolidating small secondary schools with less than 35 students; (vii) undertaking special&#13;
recruitment of Tamil medium teachers on a contract basis; (viii) undertaking special recruitment of&#13;
78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
university graduates according to identified subject specialist shortages; and (ix) introducing a&#13;
post-graduate Diploma in Education as an initial training course for an identified number of&#13;
graduates nnually prior to their employment as teachers. These school consolidation and English&#13;
training measures are expected to release over 6,850 teaching and administrative positions and will&#13;
accelerate the attrition and reduce the teaching force by over 25,000 teachers and administrators by&#13;
2005 and reduce the salary bill.&#13;
14.   Other key Ready Reckoner agreements regarding the supply of teachers within the&#13;
reformed teacher education system would include the following actions: (i) the intake to the&#13;
existing and new NCOEs would follow the institutions plan provided in the staff appraisal report&#13;
and take into consideration the designed capacity under the project (to match demand); (ii) the&#13;
recruitment of untrained graduate teachers would be the last resort and carried out only in&#13;
coordination with efforts to retrain untrained teachers while filling the needs on the subject basis;&#13;
(iii) a recruitment ceiling of 750 graduate teachers (made-up of 400 trained university graduates&#13;
with PG diplomas and 350 untrained university graduates for special subject needs following&#13;
prerequisite short-term training of 3 months) would be established. This will involve the gradual&#13;
increase of PG diploma and BEd graduates to reach an all trained graduate system intake of 750&#13;
by year 2003; and (iv) the intake into university post graduate diploma should be according to&#13;
subject needs identified by the provinces, consolidated by MEHE, and transmitted to the&#13;
universities by NATE.&#13;
15.   The main policy targets are outlined in the attached matrix. Government agrees to&#13;
undertake an annual review of the status of these policies during the implementation of the Teacher&#13;
Education and Teacher Deployment Project.&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATION AND DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component A: Rationalization of Teacher Deployment (estimated baseline cost US$0.2&#13;
million):&#13;
1.     Teacher recruitment and deployment practices and mechanisms would be modified to improve&#13;
response to demand while increasing equity and reducing teacher costs. This policy based activity would&#13;
reactivate the use of existing and updated teacher allocation mechanisms, and formalize the efforts&#13;
underway since 1995 to standardize the teacher cadre and link it to budgetary allocations. The revised&#13;
formula takes into consideration actual teacher needs based on student enrollments, the existing teacher&#13;
cadre, and the annual attrition of teachers from the system (loss due to retirement, death, departure etc.),&#13;
in allocation of teachers at the primary and secondary levels in all the provinces. The application of the&#13;
formula and associated mechanisms would allocate a specific cadre of teachers to each province and&#13;
school and, in turn, trigger annual agreed and fixed budgetary allocations to be determined by a new&#13;
Cadre Committee (see below) and used by MOF in making payments to the provinces. The agreed&#13;
program provides that within a period of three years the number of teachers should be rationalized.&#13;
2.     The objective of this component would be to improve the quality, equity and cost-effectiveness of&#13;
the staffing of schools through: (i) controlling teacher recruitment below attrition and apply the modified&#13;
Ready Reckoner to achieve STR targets of 26:1 for primary and 22:1 for secondary by year 2001 (see&#13;
Annex 3 for details on the application of the RR); (ii) applying the RR consistently to all schools (with&#13;
stringent provisions for variations to cater for exceptional circumstances); (iii) relating teacher demand&#13;
projection analysis to teacher supply with annual adjustments; (iv) linking the cadre entitlement for each&#13;
province to the budget allocation for salaries; (v) utilizing salary savings for quality inputs, particularly&#13;
in disadvantaged areas; (vi) requiring all teachers entering the service to have successfully completed an&#13;
accredited teacher education program (with strict criteria being applied to the appointment of untrained&#13;
teachers, where required, to meet staffing emergencies in specific situations).&#13;
3.     To achieve the above objectives, the project would strengthen the capacity of MEHE to: (i)&#13;
collect and analyze data on teacher needs, and carry out demand projections; (ii) develop strategies for&#13;
linking these needs to national supply capacity; and (iii) regulate the annual teacher trainee intake and&#13;
deployment of trained teachers. The driving mechanisms would be the annual application of modified RR&#13;
formula for staff deployment, together with linked budgetary allocations. The salary savings resulting&#13;
from the stricter application of the RR would be reallocated to quality inputs and maintenance. The goal&#13;
would be to increase the present national average allocation of 3 percent for quality inputs (but as low as I&#13;
percent in some provinces) by about 1 percent per year reaching a minimum of 6 percent by the end of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.     MERE, in consultation with Provincial Education Authorities, would be responsible for the&#13;
annual collection and analysis of teacher demand information and for the preparation of an annual report&#13;
on short and long-term staffing needs. Provincial authorities would only be allocated teacher salary&#13;
resources when their annual retrospective staffing and following year staffing plan (cadre) were submitted&#13;
and agreement on allocation reached.&#13;
5.     The approved cadre would be determined annually by a Teacher Cadre Committee (TCC)&#13;
consisting of representatives of MEHE (including the Chairman of the MEHE Teacher Transfers Board),&#13;
NATE, Ministry of Finance (MOF) which would coordinate the committee, Finance Commission and two&#13;
Provincial Representatives (nominated by Provincial Directors of Education), in consultation with&#13;
83&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Service Comnmittee (ESC). The functions and structure of the proposed TCC are outlined in&#13;
Annex 14.&#13;
6.     The recurrent teacher salary expenditure allocation for each Province as determined by the TCC&#13;
would include a margin of 2 percent of approved salary expenditure to cover special circumstances. This&#13;
margin would commence at a higher rate for those provinces which are under-staffed. For provinces&#13;
which have more staff than the accepted cadre, a staff equalization plan should be agreed to by MEHE,&#13;
ESC, MOF and each relevant province.&#13;
7.     Provinces which were over-staffed and did not meet the agreed staff equalization plan would not&#13;
be allowed to augment salary expenditures from other sources and would have to consider the student unit&#13;
cost allocations for various inputs (being developed by MEHE). Provinces which were understaffed and&#13;
were unable to attract staff under the agreed staff equalization plan would, following the development of a&#13;
suitable support and incentive plan for targeted schools, be allocated additional funds. As part of the&#13;
teacher monitoring provisions, the provinces would, in consultation with the ESC, develop during the first&#13;
year of the project measures to track teacher absenteeism. Teachers who continued to take non-approved&#13;
or excessive absenteeism (beyond dates mandated) would have their remuneration reviewed. Provinces&#13;
could then utilize unpaid funds to pay the costs of substitute teachers while being aware that no&#13;
supplementary salary allocations would be made for teachers with excessive absenteeism.&#13;
8.     The newly-appointed Transfer Boards created at zonal, provincial and ministry levels under the&#13;
1995 National Policy on Teachers Transfers, would have a critical role to play in the redistribution of staff&#13;
to achieve greater equity (Annex 5). Strict application of the requirements for initial appointment to&#13;
"non-congenial" (for a minimum of 4 years) and to "difficult" schools (for a minimum of 3 years) and for&#13;
transfer of teachers after serving a maximum of 8 years in a "congenial" and 6 years in a "very congenial"&#13;
school, would be essential. Provision would also be made through the initial and continuing education&#13;
programs for teachers to broaden areas of teaching competence. Secondary teachers should be able to&#13;
teach a minimum of one major and at least one minor subject, thereby increasing staffing flexibility and&#13;
MEHE's ability to allocate secondary and collegiate teachers more equitably.&#13;
9.     MEBE (through the Policy, Planning and Review Division) in consultation with ESC would be&#13;
responsible for designing a comprehensive plan to attract teachers to, and support teachers in schools in&#13;
less favorable and/or remote areas. The plan would be based on the newly-formulated categorization of&#13;
schools into four groups, according to degrees of hardship. This plan would be funded from the savings&#13;
on teacher salaries (as a result of applying the revised RR) and provide: (i) differential allowances based&#13;
on the degree of hardships; (ii) differential location allowances on an escalating basis corresponding to the&#13;
years of service in a particular location; (iii) consideration of years of service in less favorable schools to&#13;
be used as one of the main criteria for transfer to more favorable schools; (iv) support for teacher travel&#13;
and housing (local standards); (v) special provision to facilitate teacher access to study opportunities,&#13;
including payment of partial to full fees and assistance with travel to study centers; and (vi) support for&#13;
the education of the teacher's children where there is no secondary school available locally.&#13;
10.    As a further measure to facilitate equitable and flexible deployment, particularly on initial&#13;
appointment to hardship areas ("non-congenial" and "difficult" schools). Recent increases in salaries for&#13;
teachers should assist. Other initiatives which should be considered by MEHE and the proposed National&#13;
Authority on Teacher Education (NATE) include: (i) changing the policy on residential requirement for&#13;
initial training in undergraduate programs; (ii) increasing the number of non-residential training places;&#13;
(Mii) increasing stipends for married trainees; (iv) offering housing assistance on first appointment in&#13;
designated hardship areas for married teachers; and (v) assisting with the secondary education costs of the&#13;
children of teachers willing to remain in rural areas. For the above activities, the project would support&#13;
57 person months of technical assistance outlined in Annex 15. Terms of reference for each consultant&#13;
have been prepared and are included in the Implementation Volume.&#13;
84&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component B: Rationalization of Structure and Oreanization (estimated baseline cost US$&#13;
0.9million).&#13;
11.    The objective of this component would be to establish a national framework for an integrated and&#13;
cost-effective system of teacher education, with coordinating organizations covering all institutions&#13;
involved in training teachers. The component would strengthen the existing unit of the Teacher&#13;
Education Commissioner within the MEHE, and establish a new National Authority to develop policy and&#13;
to coordinate training institutions. It would support restructuring of the system to consist of: (i) a newly-&#13;
established National Authority on Teacher Education (NATE) for overall policy development, planning,&#13;
coordination, standardization (including accreditation of programs) and monitoring of teacher education;&#13;
(ii) three types of training institutions offering initial and continuing teacher education by direct and&#13;
distance mode - Universities, NEE and National Colleges of Education (NCOEs); and (iii) Teachers&#13;
Centers (TCs) Type A and Type B (TEIs) which would serve as a resource base for teachers in local areas,&#13;
a learning and administrative outlet for distance education activities, and a center for the delivery of&#13;
continuing education courses. Where appropriate, TCs Type A and Type B (TEIs) could also provide a&#13;
base for advisors working with teachers in local schools and/or for English language courses for teachers&#13;
in the area.&#13;
12.    The proposed restructuring would: (i) provide the framework for coordinating all aspects of&#13;
teacher education on a national basis, including the essential linking of teacher demand with supply&#13;
through the training institutions; (ii) provide sufficient initial training places to meet the national need&#13;
for trained teachers; (iii) concentrate initial teacher education in larger and more economical institutions,&#13;
centrally located in the mnain population centers, thereby increasing the proportion of students in non-&#13;
residential places; (iv) progressively transform distance mode teacher training from initial certificate to&#13;
diploma, graduate diploma courses, and to continuing education; (v) achieve a better coverage of staff&#13;
expertise in areas of specialization within each institution; and (vi) establish and safeguard standards for&#13;
teacher education programs through a national accreditation and monitoring mechanism.&#13;
13.    During appraisal agreement was reached to restructure the management of teacher education and&#13;
to establish NATE. NATE would be a semi-autonomous body responsible to the Minister for Education&#13;
and Higher Education, within the structure of MEHE, and funded as a separate entity. The principal&#13;
function of NATE would be to advise the MEHE on major issues relating to teacher education on a&#13;
national basis. This will involve: (i) developing national policy on, and planning for, teacher education,&#13;
facilitating the implementation of the integrated national system; (ii) monitoring and research; and (iii)&#13;
provision of public information on teacher education. The governing body would comprise&#13;
representatives from: the three types of teacher education institutions - Universities, NIE and NCOEs; the&#13;
Chief Commissioner for Teacher Education; Provincial Education Authorities; NEC; Ministry of National&#13;
Planning; Ministry of Finance; Education Service Board; and schools. NATE would have a part-time&#13;
chairman, a full-time director and secretariat (4 professionals and 5 administrative officers, with provision&#13;
for secondment of specialized personnel). The project would support the recurrent budget for NATE on a&#13;
declining basis. Further details on structure, relationships, functions, membership, staffing and funding&#13;
support for NATE are provided in Annex 17.&#13;
14.    NATE would have a key role in regulating the supply of trained teachers to meet projected&#13;
demand in schools as finalized through the Cadre Committee on school staffing entitlements. NATE&#13;
would make recomnmendations to the Minister, MEHE, annually, on the intake of students by discipline&#13;
for each teacher education institution. It would also advise the Minister, MEHE, on the budget&#13;
requirements for each teacher education institution, based on student enrollments and unit costs for&#13;
different types of progranms. All teacher education programs would be subject to accreditation through&#13;
NATE. This would involve peer review of programs through a NATE Accreditation Standing Comnmittee.&#13;
Further, NATE, in consultation with the teacher education institutions, would be responsible for&#13;
establishing and overview of criteria for the selection, appointment, training and promotion for teacher&#13;
educators. Two initial responsibilities of NATE would be (i) to assess the equivalency of the current COE&#13;
85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Diploma in Teaching with the Certificates in Teaching awarded by the TTCs and NIE Distance&#13;
Education, and (ii) to start the process of training needs assessment. NATE would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the design and development of a comprehensive continuing education plan and for the&#13;
accreditation of courses deemed appropriate for recognition towards a further qualification. These&#13;
activities would require technical assistance.&#13;
15.    During appraisal Government endorsed: (i) the rationalization of Colleges of Education and&#13;
Teacher Training Colleges into National Colleges of Education (NCOEs) and TCs both Type A and Type&#13;
B (TEIs); (ii) the development of some 81 Teacher Centers distributed strategically across all provinces;&#13;
and (iii) the inclusion of N1E and the faculties/departments of education of the four universities that train&#13;
teachers (Colombo, Peradeniya, Jaffna and Open University) into the integrated national system. The&#13;
proposed structure of the reformed teacher education system is outlined in Annex 16. The Office of the&#13;
Chief Commissioner for Teacher Education would be given a clearer mandate within MEHE and be&#13;
strengthened through provision of additional staff and equipment.&#13;
16.    NCOEs would be national institutions, within MEHE, responsible to the Chief Commissioner for&#13;
Teacher Education (see Annex 18). Their principal focus in the short to medium term would be on initial&#13;
training to diploma level and on short continuing teacher education courses. These programs would be&#13;
developed by the NIE national teacher education curriculum committee whose membership includes&#13;
NCOEs, Universities and schools. NCOEs would normally offer 3 to 4 disciplines for an enrollment of&#13;
around 700-1,000 students (including 300 third year students in their internship year in schools), with a&#13;
physical capacity of 500-800, and provision for residential and non-residential students. In the longer&#13;
term, with NATE's agreement, NCOEs could provide both initial and continuing education courses up to&#13;
but not including masters level. NCOEs would be given a direct budget allocation, based on NATE's&#13;
recommendations, and increased financial autonomy, under delegation through the Chief Commissioner&#13;
for Teacher Education. The Chief Commissioner for Teacher Education would continue to be responsible&#13;
to the Secretary, MEHE for the overall operation and accountability of NCOEs, in close consultation with&#13;
NATE and provincial directors of education. The Chief Commissioner would retain responsibility for&#13;
allocating individual students to NCOEs and for staffing NCOEs, under guidelines agreed through NATE&#13;
(and in accordance with the provisions of the Teacher Educator Service). For each NCOE there will be an&#13;
external Conunittee on Continuing Teacher Education, chaired by the NCOE president or vice-president.&#13;
Membership would include the Director, Continuing Teacher Education; principals of the TCs which are&#13;
run by that NCOE; the Director, Provincial Education (or nominee); representatives from institutions&#13;
operating continuing education courses for teachers through the TCs, and from relevant schools. The&#13;
principal functions of the committee would be to advise the Director, Continuing Teacher Education on&#13;
the quality and relevance of courses; the allocation of resources; matters relating to teacher access;&#13;
requirements for future course offerings, and associated resource needs.&#13;
17.    The Teachers Centers (TCs) would be integral parts of the NCOEs. Each NCOE would have&#13;
within its organizational structure a number of TCs, assigned according to location and other strategic&#13;
factors. NCOEs would receive funding for the full operation of the assigned TCs as a specific item within&#13;
their annual budget. Most TCs would employ a full time principal and about three lecturers (trained in&#13;
distance teaching), together with administrative support. The full-time TC staff would be part of the staff&#13;
of the relevant NCOE. The TC head would be directly responsible to the Director, Continuing Teacher&#13;
Education within each NCOE, would work closely with the province/district education officers and with&#13;
other training institutions who are offering courses for teachers through that TC. Some 84 Teacher&#13;
Centers would be developed (renovated, furnished and equipped), having particular regard to&#13;
demographic and access factors. There would be two types of TCs, Type A TCs (84 in number) with&#13;
capacity for about 100 teachers at one time, would cater to teachers who can attend on a daily basis (week&#13;
days and week-ends). Type A TCs would serve as (i) a center for the delivery of continuing education&#13;
courses (ranging from half day to three weeks); (ii) a resource base for teachers in the local area; (iii) a&#13;
learning and administrative outlet for distance mode teacher education activities (run by both universities&#13;
and NIE); (iv) a base for advisors working with teachers in local schools, where appropriate; and (iv) a&#13;
86&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
center for the delivery of English language teaching for teachers, if required. Type B (TEIs) (3 in&#13;
number) would offer residential facilities for continuing education courses for teachers without reasonable&#13;
daily access to Type A TCs. They may also offer the same non-residential services as Type A TCs.&#13;
Details of the location of the proposed TCs are provided in Annex 19.&#13;
18.    The Faculties/Departments of Education at the universities would provide initial teacher&#13;
education both in the disciplines to be taught in schools and in educational methodology, through either a&#13;
first integrated degree (B.Ed.) or post graduate diploma (Dip.Ed.) programs. In addition, these&#13;
institutions would, on a selective basis, continue nationally to develop programs to doctorate level. The&#13;
faculties would continue to operate under the academic structures of their institutions. In order to receive&#13;
funding for teacher education programs (suggested on a trainee unit cost basis) the selected universities&#13;
would have to agree to and participate within, the integrated national system, under policies adopted by&#13;
Govermnent on the advice of NATE. In particular, this would involve the allocation of teacher trainee&#13;
places consistent with national needs; selection of students based on agreed minimal criteria; agreed&#13;
student:teacher ratios; and the accreditation of courses by NATE.&#13;
19.    The National Institute for Education (NIE) would continue to develop programs for initial and&#13;
continuing teacher education, having a central role in developing courses for delivery by both NIE and&#13;
NCOEs. Ii would also deliver continuing education programs to upgrade teachers through the distance&#13;
mode, including diplomas in education, B.Ed degrees, and post-graduate diplomas in education and&#13;
management. Given the change-over to initial training for all teachers entering the service, NIE's delivery&#13;
role should decline over time. It would work closely with the Universities and NATE to ensure the&#13;
compatibility of course offerings and, in the case of the Open University, to share expertise on the design&#13;
and delivery of courses through the distance mode. NIE would continue to help in the professional&#13;
development of teacher educators, particularly those in NCOEs and TCs. Professional courses for teacher&#13;
educators, run by NIE, would be designed on the basis of national subject-based needs assessments,&#13;
undertaken by NATE, in all NCOEs. (See Staffing and Staff Development, below.). Technical assistance&#13;
support for NATE and the Comrmissioner of Teacher Education totaling 46 person months are outlined in&#13;
Annex 15.&#13;
Component C: UDprading of Teacher Education Programs (estimated baseline cost US$3.7 million)&#13;
20.    Both initial and continuing programs would be improved, to create a better learning climate in&#13;
the schools by raising the quality of teaching, and to make the teacher education programs more cost-&#13;
effective.&#13;
21.    The objective of the initial (preservice) teacher education program would be to prepare all&#13;
teachers prior to their entry into the teaching service. Successful completion would be a pre-requisite for&#13;
all seeking appointment as a teacher. Initial teacher education for secondary teachers would be provided&#13;
in universities (Post Graduate Diploma in Education and Bachelor of Education) and in National Colleges&#13;
of Education for primary teachers. Initial teacher education of two years would be conducted in NCOEs&#13;
followed by a one year internship prior to the award of a Diploma in Teaching. The curriculum is being&#13;
revised, with ADB assistance, to contain three major areas: general, professional and specialized&#13;
discipline/subject knowledge (Annex 9). Each NCOE has been assigned geographically in response to&#13;
enrollments and teacher needs and specific subject requirements by specialization (Annex 20A and 20B).&#13;
Student enrollment would be based on the projected demand for subject teachers. Entry to NCOEs would&#13;
require a minimum of 3 subject passes at A level. Each student would select one major with one or two&#13;
minor subject disciplines. Initial proposals for the subjects and hours allocated to each year of study&#13;
would reduce the total number of contact periods from the present 35 to between 28 and 23 per semester.&#13;
Teaching observation and practice in affiliated schools would be an essential component during each year&#13;
of the program. Within the next ten years, as the country is expected to move towards a degree teacher&#13;
87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
force, a three year Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) should be developed for NCOEs and selected&#13;
universities, to replace the present two year course in NCOEs.&#13;
22.    The objective of the continuing (inservice) teacher education program is to improve the quality&#13;
of teachers already in the teaching service. This sub-component builds on and complements the present&#13;
distance education program (assisted by SIDA) which has been making important progress in providing a&#13;
first level certification to untrained teachers. Of the 48 percent of teachers now untrained, about 30,000&#13;
will obtain their first certificate in 1996, another 15,000 in 1997 and 10,000 in 1998 (leaving about 15&#13;
percent untrained). The continuing education program, as expanded by the Project, would thus continue&#13;
the important work of giving all untrained teachers a first training, and in addition undertake further&#13;
upgrading and offer refresher courses for lowly qualified teachers. The content and scope of courses in&#13;
continuing teacher education would change based upon the outcomes of on-going needs assessments of&#13;
teachers (para 2.24), through course design and syllabi prepared by NIE utilizing technical assistance.&#13;
Courses would be offered in all teacher education institutions - Universities, NIE and NCOEs (including&#13;
TCs). The strategy would be to offer four major types of continuing teacher education courses: (i)&#13;
upgrading; (ii) broadening; (iii) re-training; and (iv) refresher courses. These courses with costs estimated&#13;
at US$3.2 million (costed as part of staff development) are outlined in Annex 21.&#13;
23.    The project would support the following technical assistance, overseas assignments and&#13;
fellowships: (i) 51 consultant months for program design and courses outlines (see Annex 15 for&#13;
details); (ii) 42 consultant months for teacher educator training in new programs and 180 persons months&#13;
for curriculum development of pre-service teacher education programs; (iii) 40 consultant months for the&#13;
design, update and development of continuing programs; (iv) 6 international consultants for assessment&#13;
and modification of certification and 10 consultant months of national consultants to conduct pilot needs&#13;
assessment; (v) 48 consultant months for national curriculum development at NIE; (vi) three consultant&#13;
months to update and develop student selection criteria; (vii) annual seminars for teacher educators; (viii)&#13;
fund annually approved pilot initiatives in teacher education; and (ix) update and develop continuing&#13;
education materials and their printing costs.&#13;
24.    The Project would also support the procurement of books for libraries, equipment and educational&#13;
materials at each of the following; (i) at Faculties of Education in the universities of Colombo, Peradeniya&#13;
and Jaffna up to US$120,000 and for the Faculty of Education at Open University US$75,000; (ii) at NIE,&#13;
US$120,000 for the Department of Distance Education and US$80,000 for the Department of Teacher&#13;
Education; (iii) at 78 Type A for books, equipment and educational materials, US$ 10,000; (iv) at 3 Type&#13;
B TCs (TEIs) for equipment and educational material US$180,000; (v) at existing NCOEs equipment and&#13;
educational material allocations ranging from US$100,000 to 300,000, depending on needs; and (vi) at&#13;
new NCOEs about US$ 300,000 for equipment and educational materials for a total of US$2.3 million.&#13;
Component D: Strengtheninine of Staff and Manaeement: (estimated baseline cost US$11.2 million -&#13;
including continuing education).&#13;
25.    The proposed 14 NCOEs and 84 Type A TCs and 3 Type B TCs (TEIs) would require a total of&#13;
about 190 administrative and about 1110 academic staff. Staffing numbers for the NCOEs are listed in&#13;
Annex 23. Staffing of the four universities and NE (Department of Distance Education and Department&#13;
of Teacher Education) central campuses would remain at approximately the current level of about 160.&#13;
These numbers indicate almost the same number of teacher educators as in 1994, when there were about&#13;
700 academic staff in the 10 COEs and 16 TTCs, 160 academic staff in universities, 250 senior tutors in&#13;
NIE study centers and a number of tutors in regional study centers for which there are no official data.&#13;
During the first two years of the project conversion would be made to the new staffing structure. The&#13;
majority of staff appointments would be made from the existing staff at COEs, TTCs and study centers&#13;
and would be based on agreed criteria outlined in Annex 24. Staff in NCOEs, including TCs, would&#13;
88&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
belong to the Teacher Educator cadre. Part-time staff may be required for specific courses and could be&#13;
recruited locally as needed.&#13;
26.    A data base of existing teacher educators has been compiled and analyzed to determine their&#13;
training needs in the context of institutional responsibilities. The project would provide opportunities for&#13;
staff who meet agreed criteria to improve their teacher education qualifications and experience. Staff with&#13;
only a first degree or less are the main candidates for staff development (Annex 23 outlines the teacher&#13;
educator staff development proposals). The goal would be to maintain following 1999, a more highly&#13;
qualified Teacher Educator Service comprising about 10 percent with PhDs, 45 percent with Masters&#13;
degrees, 35-40 percent with advanced diplomas, and about 10-15 percent with a first degree&#13;
27.    The staff development plan, financed under the project, would cover the following:&#13;
(a) Long-term fellowships: about 250 long-term fellowships (about 25 percent of proposed staff&#13;
in universities, NCOEs, TCs and NIE) would be awarded: of which about 150 educators would&#13;
further their studies within Sri Lanka ($675,000); 50 would attend training in regional countries&#13;
($400,000); and another 50 would study in OECD countries ($3.0 million). Training would cover&#13;
both content knowledge and specific courses in pedagogy. Costs are based on two years of study&#13;
for each teacher educator, usually at post-graduate level.&#13;
(b) Linkages with overseas institutions: About four teacher education institutions would be&#13;
identified overseas as link institutions. They would be the focal point for work assignments,&#13;
exchanges and training of staff. Selected national teacher educators (20 educators for 3 month&#13;
internships each year over a period of 4 years for a total of $600,000) would work alongside&#13;
overseas colleagues at link institutions to learn modern techniques and approaches to teacher&#13;
education. At the same time, teacher educators from the link institutions would visit Sri Lanka&#13;
(6 staff for about 2 months per year for 4 years for a total cost of about $720,000) to conduct&#13;
courses and seminars. The costs of establishing and maintaining these linkages are estimated at&#13;
$10,000 per institution. To support the effective and continuous exchange of knowledge and&#13;
experiences with the link institutions and avail the teacher training institutions of the "ERIC&#13;
education library service" the project would also support a computer network (Internet). The&#13;
unit cost of the equipment needed for 19 local institutions (14 NCOEs, 4 Faculties of Education,&#13;
NIE) and MEHE/NATE (total of 20) is estimated at S 100,000. Internet time use is estimated at&#13;
$ 60,000 and trai ling in the Internet estimated at $15,000. The operational costs for Internet&#13;
during the life of the project is estimated at about US$175,000.&#13;
(c) Short-term internships and study visits: About 40 teacher educators (about 2 from each&#13;
institution or about 160 educators during the four year period). would undertake short visits (of&#13;
about 3 months duration) to selected institutions in OECD countries (most at link institutions) to&#13;
gain experience of teaching and teacher education methods used in other countries. Unit cost is&#13;
estimated at $1,500 per person month, plus travel costs of $2,000. The estimated cost for 40&#13;
person years of training is S 1.0 million. Another 40 teacher educators per year (total 160) would&#13;
visit regional countries for about 4 to 6 weeks over the period of the project. Cost of these 20&#13;
visits is estimated at $280,000. Preference in both cases would be given to teacher educators over&#13;
45 years of age with at least three years to serve before retirement.&#13;
(d) Continuing teacher education: The project would support continuing education for teachers&#13;
(US$3.6 million) through NIE, the NCOEs and the TCs. Part of this effort is to be financed by&#13;
SIDA, which is already making an important contribution to teahcer education.&#13;
(e) Other training activities: (i) An annual conference for teacher educators in country would&#13;
be partially financed ($5000 annually for 4 years) under the project; (ii) Staff from teacher&#13;
89&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
education institutions within the country would be paid per diem expenses (up to a total of $4,000&#13;
per year for four years) to visit other institutions within the country to observe pilot and other&#13;
initiatives; (iii) A three week training course would be designed and delivered in-country for&#13;
teacher educators and administrators involved in data collection and analysis and educational&#13;
planning techniques; initial technical assistance would be provided on the course design (1&#13;
month visit at a cost of $22,500). Total project allocation of $50,000 would cover this technical&#13;
assistance and partial course costs (materials, per diem); (iv) Based on a serious shortage of&#13;
national teacher education literature and materials, the project would cover the costs of&#13;
translation and printing of research reports and theses into Sinhala, Tamil and English. The&#13;
costs for these translations is estimated at Rs.50,000 per publication and the project would fund&#13;
up to 100 manuscripts/publications for a total cost of $100,000; and (v) The project would&#13;
support an annual teacher education writing competition to develop instructional materials to be&#13;
used by teacher educators. The fields of competition would cover primary (Sinhala, Tamil,&#13;
environment, mathematics) and secondary (science, mathematics, English) and professional&#13;
methodology (child psychology, methods of teaching). Financing would provide a prize of up to&#13;
Rs.50,000 in each of ten areas annually for a total of $50,000 equivalent over the five years of the&#13;
project.&#13;
28.    About 12 eminent international teacher educators, with cutting edge credentials would be&#13;
identified to offer training in Sri Lanka on the most up-to-date methodology and content available. Each&#13;
year, for about 3-4 years these eminent teacher educators would be invited to attend the annual teacher&#13;
educator conference and give critical seminars and training sessions to teacher educators and&#13;
administrators. About 12 consultant months (12 visits over 4 years for a total of $948,000) would be&#13;
financed by the project. The first specialists would, under the coordination of NATE, be identified within&#13;
six months of project effectiveness.&#13;
29.    Strategies for implementing a staff development plan of this magnitude would include: (i)&#13;
devolving responsibility for the selection and approval of candidates to NATE and working out&#13;
mechanisms for their implementation; (ii) responsibility for the daily administration of the plan being&#13;
handled by the educator within the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU); and (iii) agreeing on criteria for&#13;
selection of staff for all types of development opportunities.&#13;
Component E: StrenfftheninM and Uneradina of Teacher Trainine Institutions: (estimated baseline&#13;
cost US$49.5 million).&#13;
30.    The objective of this component would be to: (i) rationalize the number and location of teacher&#13;
education institutions to improve regional equity and to meet the projected needs for initial and continuing&#13;
education; and (ii) to improve the quality of facilities and equipment. The proposed rationalization would&#13;
reduce unit costs of operation, improve access and reduce the proportion of residential facilities required&#13;
for initial training. Under the project the existing 31 institutions presently involved in the delivery of&#13;
teacher education programs would be reduced to 19 (14 NCOEs, NE and 4 universities). Since many of&#13;
the institutions are not located where they are most needed (based on demographic and enrollment data),&#13;
and others use rented space or old Second World War army barracks that need to be replaced, it will be&#13;
less costly to construct five new institutions than to upgrade existing buildings, in places where national&#13;
needs could be better met. Such re-locations would also enable MEHE to increase the number of day&#13;
students, thus reducing operation costs. All institutions in satisfactory condition would be retained. Also,&#13;
the existing 250 teacher centers would be reduced to 81.&#13;
31.    The project would support: (i) rehabilitation and extension of 9 existing COEs, upgrading them&#13;
to NCOEs; (ii) construction of 5 new NCOEs; (iii) upgrading of facilities for teacher education at the&#13;
Universities of Colombo and Jaffna; (iv) refurbishing, furnishing and equipping 60 TCs/Type A and 3&#13;
Type B (TEIs); (v) developing, refurbishing furnishing and equipping a further 18 TCs/Type A within&#13;
90&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
existing facilities (including, as required, 10 existing TTCs); and (vi) provision of furniture and&#13;
equipment for 14 NCOEs (including Sariputta), NIE, the Universities of Colombo, Peradeniya, Jaffna and&#13;
Open University. ADB is expected to finance refurbishing the 3 Type B TCs (TEIs), providing furniture,&#13;
equipment and educational materials. The civil works will be undertaken at existing sites or at sites&#13;
already acquired by the Government. All the existing institutions COEs and TTCs (except three which&#13;
are too dilapidated or in rented spaces) will be retained either as NCOEs or TCs. The TCs will continue&#13;
primarily to conduct courses in existing schools. Details of institutional rationalization is provided in&#13;
Annex 22A and 22B.&#13;
32.    New NCOEs would be located in urban centers where a large proportion of students could attend&#13;
as lower cost day students (many have, for budgetary reasons, adopted this lower cost approach during&#13;
recent years). The project would increase the proportion of day students while increasing residential&#13;
facilities for females and maximizing the use of currently under-used boarding facilities. Residential&#13;
capacity would range from 55-84 percent of student capacity, depending on the institution, with an overall&#13;
average of 67 percent.&#13;
33.    In order to provide acceptable standards for construction, renovation and maintenance a National&#13;
Teacher Education Physical Planning and Building Committee would be established as a standing&#13;
committee of NATE. This committee would have representatives from each of the agencies involved in&#13;
teacher education, and from the School Buildings Department of MEHE, the provincial departments of&#13;
public works and the national architects' association. The committee would prepare and maintain&#13;
guidelines detailing standards considered essential for facilities (buildings, furniture and fixtures) to be&#13;
used by adults. It would also review the proposed physical planning and lay-outs for different types of&#13;
teacher education institutions to ensure that the teacher facilities norms, agreed to during appraisal, are&#13;
met.&#13;
34.    The physical facilities identified for each institution have resulted from an exercise which&#13;
matched the revised/proposed curriculum and the resources/spaces required to achieve these goals.&#13;
Detailed education and architectural worksheets have been prepared for each institution and are included&#13;
in the Implementation Volume. Thus, the facilities proposed are in response to actual needs and&#13;
programs to be offered in each institution. Where suitable facilities exist these will not be replicated.&#13;
35.    Since many of the project civil works inputs are at existing institutions the focus would be on&#13;
improving existing facilities and increasing responsiveness in order to reach acceptable common&#13;
standards. The present capacity of the existing sites would, in most cases, be filly utilized while making&#13;
the campus easier to manage. The unit investment cost (civil works, architectural fees, furniture and&#13;
equipment) per student would vary from US$1,000 - 4,600 for the existing institutions and about&#13;
US$7,400 - 8,100, dependent on site, for the new facilities. Civil works and physical facilities proposals&#13;
are listed in Annex 26. These norms are based on spaces used in other IDA-financed projects in Asia&#13;
and on the UNESCO recommended average space allocations. Detailed design work for each of the&#13;
institutions is being completed and costed by national and IDA consultants (architectural estimates have&#13;
been prepared during appraisal on the basis of educational worksheets developed for each institution and&#13;
will be available in the implementation volume). The current ADB financed secondary education project,&#13;
which also has a teacher training component, covers some of these institutions, and agreement has been&#13;
reached on how to coordinate activities.&#13;
36.    Each institution will employ one or two full-time maintenance officers. These officers should be&#13;
trained, as a pre-requisite for appointment, prior to taking up their duties (preferably in a technical&#13;
institute through a special course). The project would include the design and delivery of such a course,&#13;
with a duration of about one month, for about 32-40 maintenance officers. As part of the project, each&#13;
institution would prepare, by the end of the second year of the project, a comprehensive maintenance plan&#13;
with budget requirements (based on criteria developed by the School Construction Unit during the first&#13;
year of the project). Upon endorsement of these plans by NATE, a basis for allocation of funds for&#13;
91&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
institutional maintenance would be formulated. The institutions would administer the program, prepare&#13;
annual reports with needs and on that basis would receive future annual allocations. In the case of&#13;
NCOEs, the delegation to administer the maintenance budget would be part of the overall increase in&#13;
financial autonomy, referred to above.&#13;
Component F: Strenfthen Management and Adminsitration of Teacher Education Institutions&#13;
(estimated baseline cost of US$ 0.6):&#13;
37.    Teacher education will be delivered through a nationally coordinated system of post-secondary&#13;
institutions; the Project would address their management and funding policies. They will, under the&#13;
coordination of NATE and the Chief Commissioner of Teacher Education, be given more opportunities&#13;
for self-management, including self-management of their budgets. To assist with this process, training&#13;
would be given to institution heads, accountants or registrars and other administrators. The budgets would&#13;
be computerized with standard budget line items in all the institutions. The project would support the&#13;
review of the system during the first year of the project and offer training to about 20 senior staff and 50&#13;
administrative staff. Estimated costs are about $ 50,000 senior staff and $20,000 for administrative staff.&#13;
Such training would be offered throughout the life of the project.&#13;
38.    Self-management will allow the instutions realistic amounts for daily operation and maintenance&#13;
(contrary to the present system where authorization is needed for about every $10.00). Annually, each&#13;
institution (including the university Faculties of Education and NIE Teacher Education and Distance&#13;
Education Departments) would prepare and submit to NATE a budget following prescribed categories and&#13;
agreed norms and unit cost allocations. Once accepted by NATE, these budget lines/items would be&#13;
included in the operational budgets of the respective universities, NIE and MEHE (subdivided directly to&#13;
each other institution) and be dedicated for use for teacher training. Within that scenario, each institution&#13;
will receive every semester about half of its budget (decentralized to the school with increased&#13;
accounting). The next semester's allocation would only be made following receipt of the previous&#13;
semester's accounting report.&#13;
39.    To arrive at that budget allocation stage, two important analyses, under the coordination of&#13;
NATE, need to be undertaken during the first year of the project and later reviewed annually. The&#13;
analysis would assess all material, teacher support, books, audio visual and library needs (using some&#13;
other regional institution allocations as comparators), maintenance and salaries (related to course and&#13;
teaching loads and support staff ratios to be established) and determine what resources are required to&#13;
effectively operate a NCOE and TC. The budget would then be broken down into the following&#13;
categories: (i) new capital inputs to be included in this annual allocation, i.e. furniture and audio visual&#13;
equipment and other materials; (ii) education inputs required at the start of each academic year (such as&#13;
books, paper, etc.). All costs would be based on a list of essential requirements by program (to be&#13;
developed during the first year of the project and which would be supplied by the project and later&#13;
sustained on an annual basis by the national budget); (iii) the ongoing expenditures (monthly basis) of&#13;
programs offered, to sustain consumable materials, essential needs and develop a strategy of replacement&#13;
(progressive manner) of essential teaching materials; (iv) costed lists of essential instructional materials&#13;
such as library, textbooks and teaching aids for each program (based on norms); and (v) maintenance&#13;
requirements for the physical infrastructure. The other goal is to have, by the end of the project,&#13;
institutions which can be self managed and hold their own budgets (as done in similar institutions&#13;
internationally). Such self management would thus be based on agreed thresholds and allocated fully as&#13;
part of an annual budget clearly related to an agreed unit cost. Thus, the final budgetary allocation would&#13;
be determined by the number of trainees trained in each institution. If the number of students is larger or&#13;
smaller than the previous semester the budget allocations would be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
Studies and Monitorina: (estimated baseline cost of USS 0.3):&#13;
Six main studies would be undertaken during the project. Their principal focus would be on monitoring the&#13;
impact of the policy changes and resnuctung envisaged under the project, with particular regard to: (i) teacher&#13;
92&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
deployment polices; Cd) trainee acoe, progression, repetition, and attrition; Cdi) contnuing education; (iv)&#13;
teacher education fimding and (v) the effectins of the National Authority on Teacher Education In&#13;
addition, the project would support monitoring of the impact of improved teacher educaton on mudent&#13;
examinations and assit ith the preparton of fiture prjecL Daft Terms of Reference and esimated cost for&#13;

TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
OUTCOME, COSTS, AND BENEFITS OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES&#13;
The main focus for the Project is to rationalize teacher deployment and quality improvements in teacher&#13;
education. This would be achieved by addressing access, quality, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and sustainability&#13;
of teacher training programs in Sri Lanka. The following analysis is an attempt to assess the project activities'&#13;
cost-effectiveness which includes the main actions that would be undertaken, their outcome, and (where possible)&#13;
estimnates of their costs and benefits.&#13;
The analysis shows that the Project and the programs it supports have a broadly neutral fiscal impact The declining&#13;
enrollment in general education (both primary and secondary) due to demographic trends, with the low STR of&#13;
24:1 and the excess of teachers in the system, increases the need to rationalize use of education sector resources at&#13;
the school, provincial, and central levels. At the same time, the tight fiscal condition and the increasing public&#13;
budget deficit further intensify the need to rationalize Government expenditures and, in turn, put more pressure on&#13;
the MEHE and the provinces to rationalize teacher numbers and their distribution through recruitment control and&#13;
consolidation of small schools.&#13;
Teacher employment rationalization, linking application of the mechanism to resource allocations, would generate&#13;
substantial sector cost reductions. The summary and detailed tables below show that during the period 1996-2005,&#13;
aggregate salary expenditure (using the recent 1995 salary scale) could be reduced by Rs 1.6 billion if teacher&#13;
recruitment is controlled as planned, as the total number of teachers and school administrators would be reduced by&#13;
25,000 by 2005. If project-related reforms are carried out fully, and the improvement in education progressively&#13;
reduces repetition rates substantially, total fiscal savings during the period 1996-2005 could in the best case add&#13;
further savings of between Rs 2 and 3 billion, making total savings for the 10 years over Rs 4 billion, or US$74&#13;
million, equivalent to the costs of the project and incremental expenditures on teacher training. When the&#13;
unquantifiable (but large) benefits from improved levels of general education in the population at large are factored&#13;
in, the project benefits are massive. The saving in education salaries would be re-invested in desperately needed&#13;
quality components such as school supplies and teaching materials, increased teacher training, and to develop&#13;
support and incentive schemes to motivate teacher transfers to remote and hardship areas.&#13;

The following table includes the details of project activities, outcome, and costs and benefits. The Project&#13;
emphasizes three high priority actions: first, to rationalize the deployment of teachers, linking this to budget&#13;
allocations; second, to rationalize and standardize the numbers and content of teacher training programs&#13;
including the consolidation, physical upgrading and equitable distribution of the teacher training institutions; and&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
TEACHER CADRE COMMITTEE&#13;
Context: MEHE, through the Data Processing Branch, determines the cadre entitlement for schools,&#13;
based on the Ready Reckoner. School inputs are currently collected by Divisional Education Officers,&#13;
and forwarded to MEHE, which checks school entitlements. Based on advice from MEHE, the&#13;
Finance Commission incorporates funding provision for salaries into provincial block grants through&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. In practice, the cadre entitlements (for each school) within a given province&#13;
are used to establish the overall entitlement of that province and do not necessarily affect the actual&#13;
staff allocation to individual schools. Proposed changes for the introduction in 1996 (and for use with&#13;
MIS) provide for Zones to enter school data and for Provinces to collate Zone inputs, prior to a&#13;
random sample check by MEHE.&#13;
Project Targets: Teacher recruitment would be control below the attrition and this will lead to a&#13;
reduction in the number of teachers and the student:teacher ratio will increase to 26:1 for primary and&#13;
22:1 by 2001.&#13;
Rationale for Committee: In order to achieve and maintain the project targets, close monitoring&#13;
with annual adjustments will be required. The Cadre Comnmittee would broaden the scope for&#13;
involvement of interested parties in the application of the Ready Reckoner and the allocation of the&#13;
salaries budget for provinces, annually.&#13;
Membership: Membership would comprise: (1) the Additional Secretary (Administration), Ministry&#13;
of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) chair; (2) a representative of the National Authority for&#13;
Teacher Education; (3) two Provincial Directors of Education (Rotate in every three years); (4) a&#13;
representative of the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils; (5) two representatives of the&#13;
Secretary to the Ministry of Finance one of whom shall be from the Planning Division and the other&#13;
from the Budget Division; (6) Director of Policy, Planning and Review Division, Ministry of&#13;
Education; (7) Chairman/Secretary of Education Service Committee; (8) Chief Commissioner of the&#13;
Colleges of Education; and (9) Representative of the Finance Commission.&#13;
Functions: The principal functions of the Cadre Committee would be as follows;&#13;
* to review the annual student and staff projections prepared by the Data Processing Branch, MERE;&#13;
* to review and make recommendations to the Secretary, MEHE, on the annual adjustments to the&#13;
STR which would be required to meet the project STR targets by year 2000;&#13;
* to review the cadre requests, on a province by province basis, against the Ready Reckoner&#13;
entitlements;&#13;
* to determine annual cadre entitlements and linked salaries budget for each province, together with&#13;
any tolerance levels deemed to be appropriate, and to recommend accordingly to the Secretary&#13;
MEHE and the Secretary, MOFP;&#13;
* to monitor progress towards meeting the project STR targets on a province by province basis and,&#13;
if necessary, make recommendations to the Secretary, MEBE on strategies for achieving the&#13;
targets within the agreed timeframe,;&#13;
* to review the effectiveness of the National Policy on Teachers Transfers in achieving an equitable&#13;
distribution of teachers, nationally;&#13;
* to advise NATE, annually, on short, medium and long-term projected teacher demand, having&#13;
particular regard to requirements by discipline, medium of instruction and provincial distribution;&#13;
* to prepare an annual report to the Secretary and Minister, MEHE and the Secretary and Minister&#13;
of Finance on the staffing and the salaries budget status of each province in relation to the project&#13;
targets.&#13;

TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
Continuing Education Programs&#13;
1.     In today's society, continuing education is extremely important within all professions. The&#13;
amount of knowledge is changing and increasing all the time. A basic education or graduation cannot&#13;
last for a professional career. A person with a basic education or graduation has to be up-graded,&#13;
broadened, refreshed and even re-trained to adjust to new developments within the society. This is also&#13;
valid for teachers. What is supposed to be taught in the classrooms is changing continually.&#13;
2.     To enable teachers to remain conversant with modem trends and subject content, MEHE has&#13;
decided to expand its in-service education provincial programs and to offer more comprehensive&#13;
continuing education to all teachers in Sri Lanka. This project proposes four types of continuing&#13;
education: upgrading, broadening, retraining and refreshing. All four are equally important. These&#13;
types may be offered through distance (mixed) self-learning mode, regular contact courses or sessions, and&#13;
intensive residential courses.&#13;
3.     The basic concept of offering a broad range of continuing education programs for teachers is&#13;
essential if Sri Lankan schools are to improve their quality. Therefore, within this project, funding is&#13;
provided for the development and delivery of the four different types of continuing education:&#13;
(a) The upgrading courses would keep teachers up-to-date in subject content and methodology by&#13;
providing structured courses which would (i) largely fulfill the requirements of the Teachers Service&#13;
Minute, and (ii) allow untrained, partially trained and Basic Certificated teachers to qualify for a Diploma&#13;
in Teaching equivalent to the NCOE award. These courses would be offered through a combination of&#13;
distance learning mode and intensive face-to-face training (both residential and non-residential). For&#13;
teachers who have completed Basic Training only through distance mode, an intensive residential&#13;
component of three weeks duration would be required, rather than further distance mode training. Such&#13;
residential upgrading would be conducted in Teacher Centres (Type BlTEIs) and in NCOEs. It is&#13;
intended that project funds would be used by NIE to develop and print the 15 modules for distance&#13;
education (which would also be the basis for the three week intensive residential alternative. Such&#13;
residential courses would give preference to those teachers who had not received previous residential-&#13;
based training.).&#13;
(b) The broadening courses would encourage teachers to expand their knowledge and skills in order to&#13;
obtain additional qualifications. Courses would continue to be offered by universities and NIE, leading to&#13;
recognized awards. This project would (i) expand the range of courses available by funding the&#13;
preparation of undergraduate level distance mode courses to be identified by NATE; (ii) finance the&#13;
preparation of specialised regular contact courses; and (iii) assist in financing the organization and&#13;
administration of continuing education. NCOEs and Teacher Centres (Type A) could also be used for the&#13;
contact portions of the distance mode courses.&#13;
(c) The re-training courses would (i) allow teachers to adapt their area of specialization to meet particular&#13;
demands for specific subject teachers, and (ii) continue the provincial in-service training which could&#13;
satisfy some of the requirements of the Teachers Service Minute. Project funding would only be used for&#13;
the former; such specialized study could be taken on a full-time or part-time basis. The need for such re-&#13;
training is expected to diminish as more teachers are prepared initially (pre-service) in accordance with&#13;
identified subject demand.&#13;
117&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d) The refeshing activities would cater to the identified needs of local teachers. Such local needs will be&#13;
identified through provision of technical assistance, and training would be managed and conducted at&#13;
minimal costs through short sessions (half day to two days) given in TCs and/or in schools. Such&#13;
activities would, for example, introduce teachers to revised and new programs and strengthen the&#13;
professional identity of teachers. Refreshing activities would be contact sessions in the form of workshops&#13;
or seminars. One of their purposes is to fulfill local needs, consequently the content of the refreshing&#13;
seminars would vary from one area to the other. Another purpose is to strengthen the teacher's identity&#13;
and for that purpose the social component of meeting together in groups is very important. Refreshing&#13;
activities would not lead to any formally recognized award, although they may, over time, become&#13;
recognized for purposes of the Teachers Service Minute.&#13;

4.      The project proposes to fund only portion of the above Continuing Education program and should&#13;
not be seen as covering the costs of fulfilling the requirements of the Teachers Service Minute. The&#13;
intention is to expedite the development of distance mode modules and their delivery, and to cover the&#13;
administration anm organizational costs for a limited number of teachers in each of the four types of&#13;
Continuing Education. The costs of continuing the existing provincial in-service contact training would&#13;
not be supported by the project. The following estimated costs, covered by the project, are intended also&#13;
to give an indication of unit costs for each type of activity:&#13;

5.     The curriculumn for continuing education has to be very flexible. It should be the framework&#13;
within which the teachers have a possibility to adapt and adjust their knowledge and skills in accordance&#13;
with scientific developments and with development within the society. Initially, the content of the courses&#13;
would be based on (i) the outcome of the needs assessments and (ii) the requirements of the Teachers&#13;
Service Minute. For upgrading and retraining courses, programs would be designed to cover methodology&#13;
and subject areas where the teachers are teaching or want to teach. For broadening courses, there would&#13;
be other programs as well, such as health and nutrition, gender issues, computer science, languages and&#13;
new knowledge within the professional area. For refresher courses, the main purpose is to cater to local&#13;
needs identified by the teacher, parents, pupils and the local community. In a long term perspective, all&#13;
institutions involved in teacher education should be involved in developing ideas for continuing education&#13;
courses of all types. These ideas would be sent to NATE for evaluation and selection. The selected ideas&#13;
would be assigned by NATE for further development, processing, and implementation by NIE, NCOEs, or&#13;
universities.&#13;
6.     NATE will be responsible for the coordination of the needs and delegation of the development of&#13;
course material and course design to NIE, universities or NCOEs. The project would provide TA to assist&#13;
in training of staff who would be responsible for course layout/design and development of the distance&#13;
education self-instructional material. TA would assist in designing the set-up necessary (including&#13;
infrastructure, logistical delivery, monitoring mechanism and training of on-site tutors and facilitators) to&#13;
meet the demands of continuing education in general and distance education in particular. In total , 40&#13;
international consultant months are assigned for design and development of continuing education&#13;
programs, about half of which are proposed for distance education. There would also be 120 national&#13;
consultant months.&#13;
7.     Distance education will be used as one of the delivery modes in three of the four types of&#13;
continuing education. The Department of Distance Education and the Department of Teacher Education&#13;
within NIE as well as Open University are at present offering courses that can be classified mainly as&#13;
upgrading and broadening courses by means of distance education. These courses can and should be&#13;
continued in the new program of continuing education. Examples are B.Ed., Dip. Ed. and M.Ed.&#13;
upgrading courses offered by the Department of Teacher Education, NIE and Open University; the Basic&#13;
Certifciation courses (which could be extended to Diploma) and some broadening courses (e.g., English,&#13;
Tamil and Sinhala as a second language) offered by the Department of Distance Education, NIE. The&#13;
basic and broadening courses offered by means of Distance Education at the Department of Distance&#13;
Education, NIE, are currently funded by SIDA. The agreement made between SIDA and Sri Lanka is&#13;
effective through December 1998.&#13;
8.     The project's teacher education programs include both initial and continuing education activities&#13;
in order to enhance the quality of education. The linkages between both programs will be better&#13;
coordinated to ensure that teachers can improve their qualifications through one or a combination of&#13;
initial and continuing training courses. To make sure that the content of the upgrading, broadening and&#13;
re-training courses is suitable and supports teacher improvement, a cross-creditation of such courses will&#13;
be undertaken by NATE. However, refreshing sessions and other short courses would not be included in&#13;
such cross-creditation.&#13;

2. The expected output of 400 trained PG Dip gradutea would comne ftm Colornbo, Jafflra and Peradeniya universities. Within the 400 graduates.&#13;
it is expected that Colombo Univ.will introduce a four year undergraduate B Ed progrm It is also expected that laffnu and Peradeniya might also&#13;
introduce a B. Ed progra&#13;
3. Recruitment of the untrained university grauate would be grdualby phased out nd all recruitment of techers as pre-trained university graduates&#13;
would be from the PG Dip and B Ed progrms by 2003.&#13;
Government would move from the present recruitment of primarily untrained degree teachers to trained (one ye aflter degree) and prtially trined&#13;
(minimum of three monts intenive training followed by continuing edlucation trainng) to arive&#13;
at a fully trained output by year 2003.&#13;
** On the bae of the controDed teacher recruitment plan and the rapid decline in aeromient (intake into priuary hua declined by 3% per&#13;
year inthe last threeyears). the targat STR by year 2005 is adjusted fomn 30:1 to 27:1 in primary and from 25:1 to 22:1 in secondary and&#13;
that ME{B would adjust the Ready Reckoner formula according to the revied targets. As a result of thed austment. annual teacher&#13;
recruitment will be confined to the NCOEA grduates and a maximum of 750 teaches from uniersity grduatea The total recruitmont&#13;
will be about half of the annual attrition of teaching force and tInt would reduce the number oftteachen and adminitzators by over 18,200&#13;
by2005 and cut saries by about Rs. 1.2 billioa These policies represent a reversal of the t five years trend of recruiting teachen in&#13;

Staffing Assumptions and Allocation:&#13;
In order to maximize the use of academic staff in each institution, the following assumptions have been made&#13;
regarding likely subject combinations for staff teaching:&#13;
a.     Health &amp; Personal Hygiene can be linked with Physical Education &amp; Sports.&#13;
b.     Science, Agriculture, Aesthetics (Art, Music, Dance, Drama), Home Science, Technology/Technical&#13;
Studies staff teach both theory and practical sessions.&#13;
c.     Science and Math can be linked, if necessary.&#13;
d.     Language, Health, Aesthetics, Library staff will teach in the General, Professional Methods of Teaching&#13;
and the Specialized Area.&#13;
e.     Staff teaching Sociology of Education could also teach Sri Lankan Society.&#13;
f.     Educational Psychology could, if needed, be linked with Evaluation &amp; Measurement as well as with&#13;
Guidance &amp; Counselling.&#13;
g.     All academic staff should be involved in supervision of practice teaching and observation. Those staff&#13;
teaching in the Specialization Area should be more heavily involved in supervising students in the&#13;
internship year.&#13;
h.     Elements of Education should be linked with School &amp; Classroom Organization.&#13;
The overall basis for staffing assumes a teaching or contact load of 14-17 sessions per week per academic staff&#13;
member.&#13;

Proposed Staffing Allocation by Discipline for each Institution.&#13;
The following chart provides a basis for the staffing of each institution based on the likely specialization of staff.&#13;
This chart should be interpretted flexibly because staff strengths will vary. The allocation is based on calculations&#13;
in the Educational Worksheets which show contact periods per week and space requirements.&#13;

Annex 24&#13;
SRI LANKA&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT&#13;
In the revised system of teacher education, staff in all institutions conducting teacher education programs will need&#13;
training. Such training will vary from a few days or weeks observation to several years' full-time study leading to&#13;
recognized degrees. A training plan should be developed by the Project Coordinating Unit and NATE to cover&#13;
nearly all teacher educators in all institutions (universities, NIE, NCOEs and TCs).&#13;
ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
The initial step, which must be continually up-dated, has been to identify the academic characteristics of a large&#13;
sample (about 87 percent -- from all but one university and one COE) of staff employed in institutions in 1995.&#13;
The data collected on 613 teacher educators have been partially analysed and indicate that:&#13;
*     38 percent of the respondents were under 45 years of age in 1995; these are the only staff eligible for long-&#13;
term further education. They, and other staff not surveyed or yet to be appointed, should form the data base for on-&#13;
going analysis to prepare a staff development plan for long-term study. The remaining staff (over 45 years) should&#13;
be given opportunities for short-term study and observation.&#13;
Of this group of over 200 teacher educators, the following numbers indicate the potential magnitude of training&#13;
which may be required for existing academic staff:&#13;
Staff requiring              Staff under 45         Staff over 45&#13;
First degree                         29(5%)         73(12%)&#13;
Diploma in Education(with BA)        3 3(5%)        47(8%)&#13;
Diploma in Education(with MA)        25(4%)         25(4%)&#13;
Miasters' Degree                     116(20%)       153(24%)&#13;
Post-Masters' study                  30(5%)         66(11%)&#13;
*     65 percent of staff consider that their first degree (major subject), and 16 percent that their Masters'&#13;
degree field, is not relevant to the subjects which they teach in teacher education institutions. This needs to be&#13;
investigated further to determine whether adjustments in teaching duties would make greater use of existing&#13;
expertise. Some re-training may be needed. Following any re-assignments, a more detailed examination will be&#13;
needed of whether any of the remaining teacher educators should receive training in a different discipline.&#13;
*     40 percent of the teacher educators are not able to speak or write in English. This would hamper the&#13;
possibilities for study abroad. If any of these are in the eligible group, they should be offered training within the&#13;
country.&#13;
FURTHER ANALYSIS&#13;
Additional analyis is required of the existing sample data:&#13;
*      correlate the responses to each part of question 11 with those of question 13&#13;
*      correlate responses to questions 13 and 14&#13;
*      analyse the subjects/disciplines obtained in their degree with those which they now teach and propose&#13;
adjustments in teacher education teaching assignments accordingly&#13;
*      analyse those lecturers who were teachers, to determine at what level and subject specialisation they&#13;
taught, whether these teaching experiences are most relevant to their teacher educator duties and propose&#13;
adjustments accordingly&#13;
*      seek data on which lecturers have teaching experience at the primary level and correlate this with their&#13;
academic qualifications and their current teacher educator teaching responsiblities.&#13;
128&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*      obtain data from senior administrators in each institution to determine their specific training&#13;
requirements, especially for short management and financial training in country.&#13;
Once the Project becomes effective, and as new staff (including those in Teacher Centres) are appointed, this data&#13;
base will need to be up-dated continually so that an annual analysis can be made.&#13;
PREPARING A STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLAN&#13;
The two major categories for staff development, whether in-country or abroad, are: (i) fellowships for long-term&#13;
study; and (ii) short-term assignments and attachments. Criteria for eligibility (Annex 23) for both categories&#13;
need to be refined and agreed as soon as possible. The following steps will need to be taken:&#13;
For Long-term Fellowships:&#13;
1.     Up-date and verify the numerical data with the actual individual responses through a print out of the&#13;
coded data base of the teacher educators who are under 45 years of age. This is best done by institution,&#13;
since these data bases will later need to be compared with the recommended priorities submitted by the&#13;
heads of each institution.&#13;
2.     The recommendations from heads of institutions for priority consideration should be assessed by:&#13;
a. comparing the data base for those under 45 with the priority ranked&#13;
recommendations and assign a new rank order within each institution;&#13;
b. group this new rank-ordered sub-set into levels of formal study (First degree, Post-Graduate Dip.Ed,&#13;
Post-Graduate, Other) and prepare a new sub-set across all institutions;&#13;
c. verify from both the heads' recommendations and the data base, that this new sub-set is&#13;
accurate;&#13;
3.     Establish this new sub-set by level as the basis for determining eligibility for study in-country, in-region&#13;
and ex-region.&#13;
4.     Prepare a list of each sub-set, according to the location proposed for study.&#13;
5.     Determine, in consultation with NATE and appropriate authorities, the most appropriate levels and&#13;
specific institutions at each training location for each nominated teacher educator.&#13;
6.     Prepare a time schedule for each teacher educator to begin a fellowship. Obtain agreement from the&#13;
nominee. For those nominees scheduled to commence study during the first two years of the project (late&#13;
1996-1997), this detailed schedule should be presented to IDA or the funding agency no later than at the&#13;
time of formal project negotiations.&#13;
7.     For those persons nominated for study commencing in 1996, initiate discussions with the institution&#13;
where study is proposed to obtain admission and other logistical requirements.&#13;
8.     Obtain the required approvals from within Government and IDA or other funding agency by March 1996&#13;
for each nominee for 1996-1997.&#13;
9.     Make appropriate logistical arrangements for each nominees' study whether at home or abroad.&#13;
Short-term Assignments:&#13;
1.     From the prioritized lists prepared by each head of institution, initially select 50 percent of candidates for&#13;
short-term assignment or attachment.&#13;
2.     Rank order these candidates according to their eligibility to meet the agreed criteria (see Annex 23),&#13;
irrespective of the institution in which they serve.&#13;

Annex 29&#13;
SRI LANKA&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
Government Procurement Capacity&#13;
1.     Government capacity to handle the procurement proposed under the project is stiUl weak although&#13;
improving. All tenders undertaken for education have been decentralized to a MEHE tender committee.&#13;
In the past that tender committee suffered from inefficiencies and duplication of services resulting in long&#13;
delays with the preparation of tender documentation and bid reviews. The delays were largely caused by&#13;
the multiple levels of review and the numerous tender and technical committees (a minimum of two per&#13;
tender and staffed with different persons who met separately) with the result that MEHE took on average&#13;
8 to 12 months to process a tender. That followed by the delivery period which lasted from six months to&#13;
over one year resulting in most procurement activities taking close to two year to complete. The tenders&#13;
also suffered from external political pressures making procurement a difficult task.&#13;
2.     Following discussions undertaken during the implementation of the ongoing General Education&#13;
Project MEHE has agreed to the following adjustments which would be used during the proposed project:&#13;
a) to replace the temporary and multiple tender and technical committees by a permanent tender&#13;
committee and to establish three or four permanent technical committees (area and subject&#13;
based). Both committees (tender and technical) would meet jointly thus reducing the time lag for&#13;
tender preparation and tender analysis. The joint conunittee would also be given time limits for&#13;
each processing step.&#13;
b) The IDA Bidding documentation would be used for all ICB tenders and the provisional NCB&#13;
tenders prepared by ICTAD would be for used for all the NCB tenders.&#13;
c) MEHE has agreed to establish procurement preparation and review calendars which would&#13;
respect the tender periods listed in the bidding documentation. Thus, on the basis that he above&#13;
proposed measures it is believed that the MEHE, with some national technical assistance will&#13;
have the capacity to undertake the required project procurement activities.&#13;
3.     To achieve the above the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be staffed with a director, an&#13;
architect (with procurement and tender processing experience) and an trained procurement officer. These&#13;
posts should be filled prior to or at a minimum by project effectiveness to ensure timely implementation of&#13;
the large tender and procurement actions required. The MEHE/School Works Service would assist with&#13;
the recruitment of technical staff for the project.&#13;
4.     Tenders for civil works would be tendered using: (a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
for all works related to the construction and the rehabilitation and expansion of the NCOEs and&#13;
renovation works for the University of Jaffna; (b) National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for all works&#13;
under US$300,000 (related to the refurbishment and expansion of the Colombo Faculty of Education and&#13;
for the instaUation or the nation-wide refurbishment/installation of the TCs type A); and (c) using three&#13;
bids for smal refurbishment and rehabilitation contracts&#13;
5.    In conformity with the agreements made during appraisal the following bidding procedures will&#13;
be used: for all procurement using ICB: (a) IDA standard bidding documentation will be used for civil&#13;
works and equipment; (b) all procurement documentation will be standardized and coordinated by PCU in&#13;
consultation with the permanent tender and technical teams; and (c) that, tenders only be called folowing&#13;
IDA review of the tender documentation packages. For all procurement under NCB: standard&#13;
documentation agreed to by IDA (draft ICTAD bidding documentation) would to be used and in that&#13;
context the PCU/School Works would: (i) provide provincial services with standard documentation that&#13;
141&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
would have to be used; and (ii) retain an overview during the implementation period to ensure timely&#13;
processing.&#13;
6.     The PCU will coordinate and have an overview of all project procurement activities (tenders,&#13;
contracts and payments for architectural and technical studies, furniture, equipment, books, education&#13;
materials, printing contracts, technical assistance, training and studies) utilizing the IDA guidelines and&#13;
in accordance with the procurement threshold outlined in Annex 25. All ICB tender documentation will&#13;
require a prior IDA review and for the NCB the initial tender documentation (or if substantive changes&#13;
are made to later tenders) would be reviewed and commented by IDA prior to tenders.. PCU will be the&#13;
contact office for IDA during project implementation.&#13;
7.     To assist PCU with the process the procurement activities funds have been included in the project&#13;
for the services of national and international procurement specialists.&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER DEPLOYMENT PROJECT&#13;
IDA SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.     Progress Reviews and Reporting: The Ministry of Education and Higher Education would&#13;
assume the implementation, monitoring and reporting responsibilities for this project. These tasks would&#13;
largely be delegated to the project coordination unit (PCU) which would assume the day-to-day overview&#13;
of the project. PCU would also prepare the monthly status report required by the External Resources&#13;
Department and summarize these into semester reports for IDA in December and June of each year&#13;
starting December 1996. Based on the experience of the ongoing General Education Project, the report&#13;
would include financial and data tables and status summaries using formats suitable for both the&#13;
Government and IDA. This joint effort would reduce paper work and result in consistency of reporting&#13;
and facilitate the gradual transfer of supervision responsibilities to the IDA Resident Mission Staff in&#13;
Colombo starting the second year of project implementation.&#13;
2.     The progress reports would include the following: summary of implementation progress (write-&#13;
up and tables) listing the status of each project component and comparing it with the plans; financial&#13;
summary by component (including funds spent, committed, actual commitments versus planned and&#13;
proposals for the next semester); update of the implementation schedule, project implementation plan and&#13;
indicators (showing actual versus planned); list of issues and problems that have arisen and proposal of&#13;
options for their resolution; data table on activities (planned, actual, proposed for the next with estimated&#13;
funding needs) of such activities as civil works, training, fellowships, studies and technical assistance; and&#13;
finally, the status of credit disbursements. Every semester the report would assess if the project objectives&#13;
are still realistic and advise if new circumstances (political or administrative) are affecting the&#13;
implementation of the project goals as set-out at the time of appraisal. The joint reporting format will be&#13;
finalized during the start-up seminar.&#13;
3.     IDA would review the progress of the project a minimum of twice yearly and if possible three&#13;
times yearly. One of these mission would be a more comprehensive annual review during which all&#13;
aspects of the project would be closely reviewed. During the first review of each year a joint mission&#13;
would be undertaken with the other Donors contributing to the project. A mid-term review is scheduled&#13;
about 2 years after project effectiveness, (about July 1998) at which time the project objectives would be&#13;
closely reviewed and needed adjustments to the project content and implementation steps would be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
4.     The proposed project would be monitored and evaluated from the perspectives of inputs, process,&#13;
outputs and impact. The input evaluation would focus on whether the required resources are in place to&#13;
implement the program of activities and services. Input information would be monitored and assessed&#13;
continuously (reported quarterly, semi-annually "semester reports" and annually) to identify the delivery&#13;
input so that problems could be resolved in a timely manner. The process evaluation would examine the&#13;
approaches used in the training, service delivery and recipient participation and review the levels of&#13;
performance comparable to project inputs and suggest remediation of non-responsive inputs. The output&#13;
evaluation would focus on the immediate results of activities, as demonstrated, for examples&#13;
improvements of exam results in schools where the qualifications of teachers have been improved etc..&#13;
The output evaluation would focus on the program outputs in the terms of programs and review such&#13;
factors as: the number to trainees per programs; if the equitable distribution of trained teachers is&#13;
improving; whether student teacher ratios are being adjusted; and linkages between the budget and cadre&#13;
allocations within each province.&#13;
S.     The above evaluation steps would be supplemented by studies (outlined in annex 23). These&#13;
studies would assess the impact of the teacher educational and teacher deployment policies being&#13;
150&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implemented. Since this is a very technical project supervision by IDA staff should be guided by a&#13;
experienced educator supported by an education economist who would assess the project's progress. In&#13;
view of the large civil works activities in this project, during the annual review the latter specialists should&#13;
also be assisted by an architect (first year external specialist and afterwards by national specialists).&#13;
6.      The IDA project supervision would be allocated an annual average of 16 staff weeks for in-&#13;
country and desk supervision of this project. However, the number of staff weeks required during the first&#13;
two years would be about 20 reducing to about 12 during the third and fourth years of implementation. It&#13;
is estimated that about half or 8 staff weeks would be used in-country and the other half doing desk work&#13;
related to the project:&#13;

Assumptions and Notes:&#13;
1- Data for 1994 was obtained by the mission (October 1995) from MEHE. Teacher education cost is 6% of MEHE budget and 3.3% of total education budget&#13;
2- Cost projections are based on 1994 unit costs and on expected capacity needs.&#13;
3- The proposed rationalization includes the conversion of the COEs and TTCs into NCOEs&#13;
4- The basic distance teacher education program will be reduced by 1998 when the backlog of untrained&#13;
teachers currently in training will be completed and new courses will be developed.&#13;
5- Continuing education through short upgrading courses in proposed teacher centers&#13;
will be phased in to meet annual needs.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Teacher Education
            and Teacher Deployment Project, based on policy initiatives
            agreed between the government and IDA over the past year,
            are to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and coverage
            of education in Sri Lanka, by: 1) improving education
            attainment and equity; 2) making the system more efficient;
            3) making more effective use of education expenditure; 4)
            improving the quality of teacher education; and 5) making
            the teacher training system more cost-effective. The project
            will consist of the following components: 1) rationalization
            of teacher deployment; 2) rationalization of structure and
            organization of teacher education; 3) upgrading of teacher
            education programs; 4) strengthening of staff and
            management; 5) strengthening and upgrading of the teacher
            training institutions; 6) strengthening the management of
            teacher training institutions; 7) studies and monitoring;
            and 8) project coordination.
