URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                  Republic of Sierra Leone&#13;
Beneficiaries:             Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC); Department of Energy and&#13;
Power (DOEP); and Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA)&#13;
Poverty Catezorv:          Program of Targeted Interventions&#13;
Amount:                    SDR 24.5 million (US$36.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                     Standard IDA, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Commitment Fee:            0.50% on undisbursed credit balances, begining 60 days after signing&#13;
less any waiver&#13;
Onlendine Terms:           SDR 19.2 million (US$28.2 million equivalent) of the Credit would be&#13;
onlent from the Government to GVWC for 20 years including a grace&#13;
period of five years at 7.1 % interest rate per annum. GVWC would&#13;
bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Project Description:       The proposed project would support a major rehabilitation of the&#13;
water supply system, rehabilitation of a small existing sewerage&#13;
system and the establishment of a low-cost sanitation program in&#13;
Greater Freetown. It would also improve the public and private sector&#13;
capacities for operating and maintaining these systems. (I) Water&#13;
Supply: (A) GVWC water system rehabilitation and expansion: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation of the Guma Dam intake tower and diversion of wet&#13;
season flows from small catchments into the Guma reservoir; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitation of the Guma Water Treatment Plant; (iii) construction of&#13;
bulk pipelines to supply the growing eastern areas of Freetown; (iv)&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of the water distribution system; and (v)&#13;
consultant services for supervision; (B) GVWC institutional&#13;
strengthening: (i) supply of computers and software for accounting&#13;
and management information systems; (ii) supply of vehicles and tools&#13;
for maintenance; (iii) technical assistance to implement computerized&#13;
systems and to identify roles for private sector participation in water&#13;
supply operations to help manage increased investment programs and&#13;
operations; and (iv) training of GVWC staff; and (C) improvement of&#13;
water supply operations in other major towns, including identifying a&#13;
role for private sector involvement, through (i) provision of consulting&#13;
services for water master plan and design studies for the major towns&#13;
and an organization and finance study for the water sector outside&#13;
Greater Freetown including the water supply operations in these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
towns; and (ii) institutional support. (11) Sanitation: (A) technical&#13;
assistance to plan low cost sanitation and to provide ablution facilities&#13;
in low income areas in Freetown, including the design of a community&#13;
outreach system involving NGOs and/or other private agencies; (B)&#13;
rehabilitation and pilot scale extension of DOEP's existing sewerage&#13;
system and extension of the outfalls; (C) management and consultant&#13;
services for supervision; and (D) institutional support including office&#13;
equipment and vehicles.&#13;
Benefits:                  The water supply component would improve the management and&#13;
operations of GVWC and expand supply capacity in order to meet&#13;
medium-term demand in Greater Freetown to improve public health&#13;
conditions and to enable industrial development in areas now without&#13;
water supply. The proposed project would also develop an&#13;
institutional framework for water supply operations in Sierra Leone&#13;
including the other major towns. The sanitation component would&#13;
rehabilitate the existing sewerage system and assist in the planning&#13;
and implementation of low cost sanitation measures in priority areas&#13;
in Greater Freetown.&#13;
Risks:                     The main project risk is associated with the capacity of GVWC and&#13;
SLRA to implement their respective project components. GVWC,&#13;
with its long history of capable technical performance and its&#13;
successful implementation of the water supply component of the&#13;
ongoing Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP) (Credit&#13;
2511-SL), is expected to manage well the implementation of the water&#13;
supply component of the proposed project. To make use of existing&#13;
and proven capability, DOEP will employ GVWC through a&#13;
management services contract to implement, on its behalf, its&#13;
sewerage component. SLRA has demonstrated its capability in&#13;
implementing its various components under the FIRP project, will be&#13;
responsible for implementing the sanitation sub-component. Another&#13;
main risk is related to the availability of counterpart funding.&#13;
GVWC's financial projections indicate that GVWC would be able to&#13;
generate sufficient funds to meet its counterpart obligations. For the&#13;
other project components, as in the FIRP project, the Government&#13;
would be required to make agreed initial deposits into project accounts&#13;
to be established before credit effectiveness and to make quarterly&#13;
deposits into this account during project implementation. For the&#13;
longer term, GVWC may face the risk of sustaining its viability in the&#13;
light of the fact that most water utilities in Africa face severe&#13;
operational and financial difficulties. This risk would be minimized&#13;
through the Government's and Bank's continued support for the&#13;
autonomy of GVWC and modernization and strengthening of&#13;
GVWC's operations under the proposed project, and through the&#13;
development and implementation under the project of a strategy for&#13;
increasing private sector participation in water operations. The low-&#13;
cost sanitation component has an element of risk associated with the&#13;
difficulty of promoting and sustaining community-based activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11i&#13;
This risk is being reduced by using the same implementing agency&#13;
(SLRA) that has gained pertinent experience through the&#13;
implementation of the urban upgrading components of the FIRP and&#13;
by ensuring the involvement and commitment of the communities.&#13;
The security situation in Sierra Leone, if deteriorated in the future,&#13;
may also affect project implementation especially in the carrying out&#13;
of the water master plans and organization and finance study for&#13;
major towns outside Greater Freetown.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.I    Sierra Leone is endowed with substantial mineral resources, ample cultivable agricultural land&#13;
and rich fisheries. However, largely as a result of past mismanagement of resources and inadequate&#13;
development efforts, the majority of its people live in extreme poverty with a per capita income of&#13;
about US$240 in 1990/91. It is classified as one of the "least developed" countries by the United&#13;
Nations. Since the late 1970s, Government institutions have deteriorated and have limited capability to&#13;
deliver even the most basic services. Most infrastructure systems have similarly deteriorated to a point&#13;
of near collapse. The living conditions for urban residents, particularly in the capital, Freetown, are&#13;
especially difficult and the quality of life, economic opportunity and environmental conditions are&#13;
extremely poor.&#13;
1.2   In December 1989, to reverse past trends, the Government embarked on a far-reaching reform&#13;
program, aimed at stabilization and structural adjustment of the economy. Significant reform measures&#13;
have been successfully implemented, including liberalization of the exchange rate, decontrol of&#13;
commercial bank lending rates and substantial increases in other interest rates, strengthening of revenue&#13;
collection and expenditure controls, liberalization of domestic pricing and trade and revamping of&#13;
natural resources policies. In early 1992, the Government commenced a further program of economic&#13;
recovery and structural adjustment with the support of international agencies including IDA.&#13;
1.3   IDA has actively supported the Government's structural adjustment and economic recovery&#13;
program through a reconstruction import credit (Cr. 2352-SL) approved by the Board on April 14,&#13;
1992. This policy-based credit has helped to restore the Government's capacity to provide essential&#13;
services and to manage economic reforns. It was followed by two investment credits, the first for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the power supply and distribution approved by the Board on April 21, 1992 (Cr.&#13;
2356-SL) and the second for rehabilitation and maintenance of the roads system approved on&#13;
December 22, 1992 (Cr. 245 1-SL), and a technical assistance credit (Cr. 2435-SL) approved on&#13;
November 19, 1992, Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP) (Cr. 251 1-SL) approved on&#13;
June 10, 1993. A Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2546-SL), approved in October 14, 1993, will&#13;
continue to support the Government's economic reforms and help provide foreign exchange for imports&#13;
of essential goods and budgetary support for priority public expenditures.&#13;
1.4    The Government has requested IDA to finance the proposed project to expand water supply&#13;
and improve sanitation conditions in Freetown and to undertake watcr supply master plan studies for&#13;
the major urban centers. The proposed project is a follow up to the FIRP, which provides for&#13;
improvement of the operations of the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) through leak detection&#13;
and repairs and universal metering program, and financing of studies to update the Water Master Plan&#13;
and Storm Drainage and Sewerage Master Plan and to review the organization, management and&#13;
finances of GVWC. Based on the results of thesc studies, the proposed project will improve and&#13;
modernize the management and operations of GVWC and rehabilitate and expand its water supply&#13;
systems to meet water demand through year 2005 in Greater Freetown. Furthermore, the project will&#13;
develop an institutional framework to improve water supply sector operations by carrying out an&#13;

II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A. Water Resources and Sanitation&#13;
2.1    Sierra Leone, which lies along the Atlantic seaboard between latitudes 7 and 10 degrees north&#13;
and longitudes 10 and 13 degrees west, occupies an area of some 72,500 sq km in the bulge of West&#13;
Africa. To the north a 650km border is shared with Guinea while Liberia provides the boundary along&#13;
some 250 km to the south. Much of the westem half of the country lies below 200m, rising from&#13;
mangrove swamps which parallel the coast to the higher and less level ground of the interior lowlands.&#13;
East of these lowlands the ground again rises to the interior plateau, reaching an altitude of over 900m&#13;
in the Tungi and Loam mountains and a maximum of 1,950 m in Mount Bintumani, the country's&#13;
highest peak.&#13;
2.2    Climatically the year is divided into well defined dry and wet seasons, the latter of which&#13;
extends from May to mid-November. In general, mean annual rainfall decreases from an average of&#13;
some 500cm in the South to under 200cm in the North. Temperatures throughout the year are in the&#13;
25-30 degrees centigrade range, the hottest periods being at the beginning and end of the dry season&#13;
between which the Harmattan wind from the Sahara blows almost daily conveying fine dust which&#13;
hazes the landscape. The major river systems which traverse the country provide perennial water for&#13;
agriculture and domestic use. Seasonal rainfall causes variations of up to 18 m in the river levels, the&#13;
upper reaches are subject to tidal flooding. Most of the rivers are navigable for some miles upstream&#13;
from the sea and towns have grown from early trading settlements established at their heads of&#13;
navigation.&#13;
2.3    Reticulated drinking water supplies throughout Sierra Leone are almost entirely based on the&#13;
use of surface sources, the country being adequately served by perennial rivers fed by a high level of&#13;
annual precipitation'. Traditional sources in the rural areas also rely heavily on surface waters&#13;
although shallow wells are utilized to a lesser extent and the Government has introduced a shallow well&#13;
development program. Due to the ready availability of surface water, very little has been done to&#13;
investigate the extent of underground resources outside Freetown where there are no groundwater&#13;
resources.&#13;
2.4   In rural areas, communities are served primarily by unprotected shallow wells, lakes and&#13;
rivcrs. Solid and liquid wastes, human and animal excreta all contributable to contaminating ground&#13;
water sources. Siltation in river beds and lakes caused by mining activities exacerbates the problem for&#13;
rural communities in search of potable water. The time spent in travelling long distances in search of&#13;
safe water can be substantial and is time taken away, usually from women, from more productive&#13;
activitics such as child care2.&#13;
2.5    The only public sewers in Sierra Leone are two small ones in Freetown, which are maintained&#13;
by the Water Supply Division (WSD) of the Department of Energy and Power (DOEP). A study&#13;
"Master Plan for Wastes in Freetown" in the early 1980s proposed much more extensive sewering but&#13;
no action has been taken on the recommcndations. Otherwise all sanitation is the responsibility of the&#13;
Department of Health and Social Services (DOHSS), operating through Health Inspectors under&#13;
' Sourcc: IBRD Watcr Supply and Sanitation Sector Study, Report N° 4633 SL, dated October 1983&#13;

B. Sector Organization&#13;
2.6    Before 1961, the (then) Public Works Department was responsible for water supply in Sierra&#13;
Leone, except for Greater Freetown which was the responsibility of the Freetown City Council. The&#13;
Guma Valley Water Ordinance 1961 established GVWC with an area of supply of 42 square miles in&#13;
and around Freetown, and now supplying population of about 0.6 million. Water supply for the&#13;
remainder of the country became the responsibility of then Ministry of Works until 1974 when it was&#13;
transferred to the Water Supply Division of the then Ministry of Energy and Power. Following the&#13;
recommendation of the World Bank Report "Water Supply and Sanitation Study" for Sierra&#13;
Leone(1983), the Government decided in August 1988 to establish Sierra Leone Water Company&#13;
(SLWC) to eventually take over responsibility for urban water supplies. As a first phase, SLWC, with&#13;
some 30 staff, has taken over the water supply operations in the provincial headquarters of Bo and&#13;
Makeni, with WSD still responsible for Kenema, the District Headquarters of Kodiu/Yengema and&#13;
other secondary towns, and rural population estimated at 3.4 to 4.4 million. The enabling Act for&#13;
SLWC, which is still in draft form, will be reviewed as part of the organization, management and&#13;
finance study financed under the proposed project (para. 2.8) with the view of defining its role in the&#13;
creation of water companies based on the GVWC operating structure.&#13;
2.7    Water supplies outside the GVWC area are regulated by the Water (Control and Supply) Act&#13;
1963. This Act apparently envisaged the setting up of one or more independent Water Authorities',&#13;
each with Board members appointed by a Minister. The Department of Works (DOW) is responsible&#13;
for drainage.&#13;
2.8    To rationalize institutional arrangements for the water supply sector outside Freetown, an&#13;
institutional, management and finance study for the sector including SLWC, which is responsible for&#13;
water supply operations in Bo, Kenema and Makeni, will be carried out under the proposed project.&#13;
The draft TOR for this study has been discussed and agreed with the Government. Agreement has&#13;
been obtained that this study will be completed by June 30, 1996 and that within three months from the&#13;
completion of the study, the Government will prepare an action plan to implement the recommendations&#13;
of the study, as agreed between the Government and IDA.&#13;
C. Sector Development Stratezy&#13;
2.9    The water sector strategy is contained in the draft policy letter prepared by the Government as&#13;
shown in Annex 2- 1. In common with most sectors of Sierra Leone's economy, the immediate needs in&#13;
the water supply and sanitation sector are the rehabilitation of existing systems and associated&#13;
improvements in operation and maintenance. These measures would provide the highest economic&#13;
return. Rehabilitation would logically be followed by programs of carefully planned expansion and&#13;
improvement of existing systems to provide acceptable levels of service to a rapidly increasing&#13;
population. A countrywide water resources plan and groundwater studies would be needed in the&#13;
longer tern development of the sector. The water master plan studies for the major towns including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Bo, Kenema and Makeni financed under the proposed project will be an important step towards this&#13;
end.&#13;
2.10   The short, medium and long term strategy for GVWC was defined by the IDA-financed&#13;
GVWC Organization and Financial Review and Water Supply Master Plan studies which were&#13;
finalized in March - June 1994. The FIRP and the proposed project are, therefore, addressing the short&#13;
and medium term strategic devclopment of GVWC which is to (a) maximize the supply of water&#13;
available from existing sources/water systems by minimizing losses/unaccounted-for water and&#13;
increasing yield of the Guma Reservoir; (b) manage water demand effectively through appropriate&#13;
tariff policy based on metered consumption; and (c) maximize the efficiency of the water supply&#13;
operations of GVWC.&#13;
2.11   This strategy to maximize water supply to Greater Freetown from existing sources is intended&#13;
to defer the high long term capital cost (approximately $150 million) of developing the Orugu dam (a&#13;
new major source of water supply for Greater Freetown) until it becomes essential and consumers&#13;
would be willing to pay for it. This will provide GVWC with time to consolidate its operational and&#13;
financial position as a result of investing in the FIRP project and the proposed project.&#13;
2.12   Despite economic hardships which beset the country, GVWC has been a remarkably strong&#13;
and successful organization. At the core of GVWC's success is the financial and operational autonomy&#13;
granted under its enabling Act. This autonomy has been respected by the Government over the years,&#13;
as evidenced by a complete lack of government interference. An independent judicial inquiry confirmed&#13;
in 1993 the operational and financial integrity of GVWC.&#13;
2.13   As indicated in paras. 2.6 and 2.8, the institutional management and finance study, to be&#13;
financed under the proposed project, will recommend the organizational framework for water supply&#13;
outside Grcater Freetown including the roles of WSD and SLWC. It is envisaged that SLWC would&#13;
play a key role in developing the water supply systems in the urban towns as well as in establishing&#13;
water supply utilities for these towns substantially along the GVWC model.&#13;
2.14   With respect to sanitation, an initial effort at addressing the health and sanitation conditions in&#13;
Freetown is being made under the FIRP. FIRP includes slum upgrading, the provision of waste&#13;
collection and disposal facilities and ablution facilities particularly in the selected low income areas.&#13;
These efforts would be extended in the proposed project. The proposed project would also rehabilitate&#13;
the existing small sewage system. These initial steps would maximize benefits from existing facilities&#13;
and stimulate future development of the Freetown sewerage system. The consultants' report on the&#13;
"Sewerage and Drainage Master Plan Study," also financed under the FIRP, has recommended, among&#13;
other things, that the sewerage operations in Freetown be transferred from DOEP to GVWC. It was&#13;
noted, however, that GVWC will be preoccupied in the next 2 to 3 years with the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project and the ongoing FIRP, and the reorganization and modernization of the company&#13;
(para. 4.6). It has been agreed that the sewerage functions in Freetown will be transferred from DOEP&#13;
to GVWC not later than January 1, 1998, and that an action plan for this transfer will be updated by&#13;
DOEP/GVWC by January 1, 1997 to be jointly reviewed with IDA. This action plan will also include&#13;
the transfer of assets and liabilities between the Government and GVWC as well as the sewerage&#13;
charges to be put in effect by GVWC to ensure that the revenues accrued from the sewerage operations&#13;
will, at the minimum, be adequate to meet their cash operating expenses and debt service related to the&#13;
sewerage operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
D. Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
2.15   Bank involvement in the water supply sector began with the preparation of the "Republic of&#13;
Sierra Leone Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study" which recommended the creation of SLWC.&#13;
After a decade-long hiatus, the Bank resumed its involvement through the water supply component of&#13;
the FIRP approved in June 1993 (Cr. 251 I-SL). The FIRP objectives are to rehabilitate and upgrade&#13;
essential urban infrastructure and services in Greater Freetown, including the improvement of the water&#13;
supply capacity of GVWC through a leak detection and repair program and universal metering&#13;
program and to modernize its financial and operational facilities. The water component of the FIRP is&#13;
being implemented well and on schedule. The lessons learned from this are that early project&#13;
preparation, well-planned procurement processing and GVWC's demonstrated management capability&#13;
are critical factors in successful project implementation These lessons have been incorporated in the&#13;
design and preparation of the proposed project. The proposed project, which builds upon the water&#13;
supply component of the FIRP, will develop model(s) for support for water operations in other urban&#13;
centers, including possible uses of local private management contract services. It will also finance&#13;
water master plan studies for three major towns which will be the basis for future assistance by&#13;
external agencies.&#13;
2.16   Through IDA involvement under the FIRP, the Government and GVWC have relied on the&#13;
Bank for advice on water sector policy and institutional development. IDA is also assisting GVWC and&#13;
the GOSL to examine the management implications of the projected large growth in the investment&#13;
program and future operation and maintenance needs. The proposed project is consistent with the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) reviewed by the Board on October 14, 1993. The IDA strategy for&#13;
Sierra Leone stresses the need to rehabilitate infrastructure, including water systems, and to promote&#13;
sustainable development by improving the capacity of agencies such as GVWC. Given limitations in&#13;
the public sector, it recognizes the need for private sector participation in providing many critical social&#13;
services. The strategy also supports the provision of basic needs such as water supply to poverty&#13;
groups.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
3.1    Following the resumption of Bank operations in Sierra Leone in April 1992, the Bank assisted&#13;
the Government in preparing an immediate action project to address the unsatisfactory condition of&#13;
urban infrastructure in Freetown. This resulted in the Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(FIRP) approved by IDA in June 1993. The FIRP includes, among other things, provisions to improve&#13;
operations of GVWC through leak detection and repairs, universal metering and computerized billing,&#13;
and to carry out studies to update GVWC's Water Master Plan and review its organization and finance.&#13;
The proposed project would be a follow-up to the water supply component of the FIRP and is aimed at&#13;
continuing to improve the operations of GVWC, to rehabilitate and expand its water supply systems&#13;
and to improve sewerage and sanitation in Freetown. In February/March 1994, a preappraisal mission&#13;
visited Sierra Leone to begin the appraisal of the project and its individual sub-components. Project&#13;
appraisal was carried out jointly with the African Development Fund (ADF) in May/June 1994. In&#13;
February 1995, since ADF funding was not available as anticipated for the project to move forward,&#13;
the Government, in consultation with ADF, requested increased IDA financing for the entire project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
B. Proiect Objectives&#13;
3.2    The main objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to improve water supply and sanitation&#13;
services in Freetown; (ii) to improve the accessibility of these services to the urban poor; and (iii) to&#13;
ensure that water supply and sanitation services will be sustained by strengthening the sectoral&#13;
institutions, especially the GVWC and the agencies to be responsible for sanitation, and by introducing&#13;
private sector participation. The project would also help prepare water supply master plans and&#13;
development programs as well as institutional framework for the major towns outside Freetown.&#13;
C. Proiect DescriDtion&#13;
3.3    The proposed project will support a major rehabilitation of GVWC's water supply system,&#13;
rehabilitation of a small existing sewerage system and the establishment of a low-cost sanitation&#13;
program in Greater Freetown. It would also improve the public and private sector capacities for&#13;

3-2 and 3-3.&#13;
D. Project Costs&#13;
3.5    Project costs including physical and price contingencies are estimated at about US$46.5&#13;
million equivalent. This amount includes duties and taxes on imported goods totalling US$6.3 million&#13;
equivalent, including US$5.5 million equivalent for the GVWC component. Foreign costs are&#13;
estimated at about 80% of the total project costs excluding duties. Physical contingencies of 10% were&#13;
allowed on all items except rehabilitation of the Guma intake and treatment works, where 15% was&#13;
allowed. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of the following inflation factors: for&#13;
foreign exchange costs 2.0% in 1995, 2.5% in 1996, 2.7% in 1997 and subsequent years; for local&#13;
costs, and 16.0% in 1995, 11.0% in 1996, 6.8% in 1997 and 5% in 1998 subsequent years.&#13;

3.8   The proposed IDA credit of US$36.0 million would be made to the Govemment. Of this&#13;
amount, US$6.1 million would be made available to GVWC to implement, on behalf of DOEP, the&#13;
rehabilitation of the sewerage system (US$2.8 million) and the two studies for watcr master plans and&#13;
organization and finance for SLWC (US$3.3 million). Also, US$1.70 million will be made available&#13;
to SLRA to implement the sanitation sub-component. The balance of about US$28.2 million of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
proposed credit would be on-lent to GVWC for a 20-year repayment period, including a grace period of&#13;
5 years, at an annual interest rate of 7.1% under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
foreign exchange risk would be borne by GVWC. Interest during construction would be capitalized.&#13;
The Government would finance the duties and taxes related to GVWC's project component (US$5.5&#13;
million equivalent) which would also be capitalized and repaid to the Government over the life of the&#13;
subsidiary loan. Counterpart funding for the water supply component, other than related duties and&#13;
taxes and interest during construction, will be provided by GVWC from its internal cash generation.&#13;
This financing plan was confirmed during the negotiations. Agreement has been obtained that the&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and GVWC will be executed prior to the&#13;
effectiveness of the proposed credit.&#13;
3.9    With respect to counterpart funding by the Government for duties and taxes on imported&#13;
equipment and materials for the project, the Government will undertake to expedite the clearance of&#13;
such goods through customs. To provide the remaining counterpart funding for the financing of the&#13;
project (i.e. other than those to be provided by GVWC for its own project components), and to ensure&#13;
that such funding will be timely and adequate to expedite project implementation, the Government will&#13;
set up two project accounts in the names of the implementing agencies GVWC and SLRA into which&#13;
quarterly disbursements will be made to cover required payments against project expenditures. The&#13;
Government will establish these project accounts with an initial deposit of Le 50 million each prior to&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementing Auencies and ResDonsibilities&#13;
1. Project Implementation Arrangement&#13;
4.1    GVWC will be responsible for implementing its project component. GVWC will also manage&#13;
the implementation of the sewerage component on behalf of DOEP as well as the procurement of office&#13;
equipment and vehicles and appointment of consultants for the studies for DOEP/WSD/SLWC.&#13;
GVWC has agreed to appoint, prior to credit effectiveness, a sewerage engineer to assist its Chief&#13;
Engineer in managing the implementation of the sewerage component. DOEP, through its Water&#13;
Supply Division (WSD) and SLWC, will be responsible for supervising the water supply master plan&#13;
and organization and finance review studies related to the secondary towns (e.g. Bo, Kenema and&#13;
Makeni). DOEP has appointed a Steering Committee, to provide guidance to GVWC in carrying out&#13;
these activities. This committee is chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Energy and Power and&#13;
includes, as members, the heads of DOEP/WSD, SLWC and GVWC.&#13;
4.2    Given their experiences in implementing the urban upgrading infrastructure including&#13;
sanitation and ablution facilities under the ongoing FIRP, SLRA will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the sanitation sub-component of the proposed project. SLRA through its Project&#13;
Management and Coordination Unit for the FIRP (PMCU/FIRP) will manage the sanitation sub-&#13;
component under the guidance of its standing Steering Committee chaired by FCC and utilizing the&#13;
services of a NGO(s) to assist with community participation in the project.&#13;
4.3    The above arrangements have been agreed with the concerned authorities and agencies.&#13;
Furthermore, DOEP has entered into an agreement with GVWC for the management of the sewerage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
sub-component and procurement of office equipment and vehicles as well as consultant services for the&#13;
two studies for DOEP/WSD and SLWC for a managemcnt services fee. This management services&#13;
contract will be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
2. Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC)&#13;
4.4    GVWC was incorporated in 1961 when the Guma Valley water system was completed with&#13;
financial assistance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC). Its organization&#13;
structure is shown in Annex 4-1. It is owned by the Government (90%) and the Freetown City Council&#13;
(10%), and controlled by a Board of six members, three appointed by the Government, two by CDC&#13;
and one by FCC. Its day-to-day operation is in the hands of a General Manager/Engineer-in-Chief. It&#13;
is autonomous, including in tariff making which has been decided by its Board without Government&#13;
interference. GVWC has a staff of about 3 10 including 14 professional engineers and accountants.&#13;
GVWC has a supply capacity of about 18 million imperial gallons (Ig) per day, most of which is being&#13;
used to serve more than 600,000 people through roughly 10,000 (unmetered) connections and 520&#13;
standpipes, and 1,600 commercial/industrial/institutional customers through metered connections.&#13;
4.5    GVWC is a generally well-run company which, in spite of the economic difficulties that the&#13;
country faced in the past years, has by-and-large managed to sustain itself GVWC's strengths include:&#13;
(i) the high degree of autonomy that it has enjoyed in conducting its operations including tariff-setting,&#13;
(ii) a stable and experienced management whose tenure with the company average at least 15 years&#13;
and who have risen through the ranks; (iii) the mode of operation, or "tradition/culture" that it has&#13;
established over the years and the reputation as among the best-run public companies in the country.&#13;
GVWC's water supply operations will be improved markedly particularly with the implementation of&#13;
the IDA-financed FIRP (Cr. 251 1-SL) which is addressing the following major issues: leakage&#13;
reduction, metering of all domestic connections, expanding the reticulation network and providing&#13;
metered connections to the plots that are not being served. GVWC has demonstrated its capability in&#13;
the implementation of its water component under the FIRP on schedule. In implementing its project&#13;
component, GVWC staff would have technical assistance and/or engineering service provided under the&#13;
proposed project as appropriate to assist in the implementation of the respective sub-components.&#13;
4.6    The consultants' study on the organization, management and finances of GVWC (para.3. 1)&#13;
made various recommendations to strengthen and modernize GVWC's management and operational&#13;
capacity. The major recommendations were for GVWC to appoint three additional professionals: a&#13;
commercial manager, a Electronic Data Processing (EDP) manager and a public relations officer. In&#13;
addition, the study recommended the supply of equipment and software for computerization of&#13;
accounting and management information systems. As agreed under the FIRP, GVWC computerized its&#13;
billings as of November 1994. Phase II of the computerization program which would cover the&#13;
accounting and management information system would be implemented in the medium term as part of&#13;
the proposed project. GVWC has adopted an action plan to implement the consultants' major&#13;
recommendations. As part of this action plan, GVWC has formally approved its new organization&#13;
structure, established a commercial division, and appointed an EDP manager, a commercial manager,&#13;
and a public relations officer.&#13;
4.7    Private Sector Participation. Public water utilities in Africa and elsewhere are experiencing&#13;
many difficulties, especially as their operations expand over time. Although GVWC is fairly well-&#13;
managed at the present time, difficulties might arise in the future as its operations expand. GVWC has&#13;
managed to maintain over the past thirty years the same level of staff strength of around 310 by making&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
use of local private sector capability, where appropriate, to perform its functions and/or services. In&#13;
fact, GVWC has employed local private contractors for services in several areas, including the&#13;
installation of water connections and meters, pipe laying, distribution expansion, computer software&#13;
technical assistance and training, ctc. To further improve the efficiency or reliability of its operations,&#13;
GVWC will investigate possibilities for using services of the private sector to perform the function(s)&#13;
or service(s), where appropriate and justified in terms of net savings to the company. In this&#13;
connection, it was agreed during appraisal that a study will be carried out under the project to identify&#13;
the specific function(s) and service(s) of GVWC which could be "privatized" and the possible form(s)&#13;
of privatization, and to assess the fcasibility of such possible course of actions. The TORs for this&#13;
study (Annex 3-3) were discussed and agreed with the IDA. GVWC has appointed a consultant for the&#13;
study. Agreements have been obtained that the Government, GVWC and IDA will jointly review the&#13;
findings and recommendations of this study not later than January 1, 1996 and agree on target dates for&#13;
implementing agreed measures, and that GVWC will undertake to implement those measures in&#13;
accordance with the agreed target dates.&#13;
3. Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA)&#13;
4.8    SLRA was established under its legislation enacted in February 1992 as a semi-independent&#13;
entity to be responsible for the administrative control, planning, development and maintenance of all&#13;
roads and related structures including ferries in the country. It has the authority to hire and fire staff,&#13;
fix salary levels higher than Govemment pay scales, sign and award contracts, receive the bulk of its&#13;
funds for road maintenance from a Road Fund as allocated by Parliament and levy other road user&#13;
charges subject to the approval of Parliament. As shown in its organization chart in Annex 4-2, it is&#13;
managed by a Director General under the direction of a Board of Directors all appointed by the&#13;
President. It reports administratively to the Secretary of State of the Department of Works and is&#13;
subject to external audit by independent auditors. SLRA will have a total staff of about 1,400, many&#13;
of whom have already been recruited from the road staff of the Department of Works. SLRA has&#13;
become fully operational and has completed key appointments of all departmental heads.&#13;
4.9    To assist the current Director General of SLRA, a former Chief Highway Engineer of DOW&#13;
and a capable manager, a Project Management and Coordination Unit/Freetown Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (PMCU/FIRP) was established successfully within SLRA to manage and/or&#13;
coordinate the implementation of all project components other than the water supply component of&#13;
GVWC of the FIRP. Specifically, PMCU/FIRP manages and oversees the implementation of the roads&#13;
component, the community/slum upgrading and market improvement sub-components of the urban&#13;
upgrading component and the various studies under the technical assistance component. It is also&#13;
responsible for the procurement of the equipment/trucks provided under the solid waste management&#13;
sub-component for the DOHSS, and procurement of equipment for FCC. The Unit also&#13;
coordinates/liaises closely with GVWC to ensure that the water supply works particularly in the project&#13;
areas are planned and carried out in a timely and well-coordinated manner to reduce cost.&#13;
4.10   The PMCU/FIRP is headed by a Project Manager financed under the FIRP project and is fully&#13;
staffed (including a local counterpart Assistant Project Manager, an Engineer/Procurement Specialist&#13;
and a Project Accountant) to carry out its functions. The Project Manager, who was appointed by&#13;
SLRA, reports directly to the Director-General of SLRA who is guided, specifically with respect to the&#13;
proposed Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, by a Steering Committee. This advisory&#13;
Committee is chaired by FCC and includes, as members, the representatives of GVWC, DOW,&#13;
DOHSS as well as other concerned Government Departments. SLRA/PMCU/FIRP have prepared an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
action plan for implementing the low-cost sanitation component, which was confirmed during the&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
B. Status of Proiect Preparation&#13;
4.11   Consultants have submitted the final reports on the studies of GVWC's Water Supply Master&#13;
Plan and the organizational/operations and water tariff structural/finances and Storm Drainage and&#13;
Sewerage. These reports formed the basis of the project appraisal by IDA in May/June 1994. In order&#13;
to expedite project implementation, GVWC, with the assistance of the consultants, has prepared the bid&#13;
documents for some project packages, which are expected to be put out for tender shortly. It is also&#13;
anticipated that invitation for bids for some packages such as transport vehicles, computer equipment,&#13;
water treatment plant equipment, bulk transfer pipes and all accessories, would be issued before mid-&#13;
1995. The TORs for all the studies financed under the proposed project have been agreed with DOEP,&#13;
GVWC and SLRA. GVWC has initiated the process of selecting consultants for supervision of&#13;
GVWC works components and for design and supervision of the sewerage component&#13;
C. Proiect Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.12   The implementation schedule for the various components of the proposed project is shown in&#13;
Annex 4-3. The source works and treatment works rehabilitation would start up about the same time&#13;
and would be substantially completed over a period of 48 months, 36 months and 40 months,&#13;
respectively. The institutional strengthening which commences in the third quarter of 1995 will be&#13;
completed in three years and the sanitation would be completed within 42 months of credit&#13;
effectiveness. The implementation of the various studies would be completed within 30 months of&#13;
credit effectiveness. The proposed project would be completed by June 30, 1999.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
4. 13   All procurement of goods and works to be financed by IDA would be undertaken in accordance&#13;
with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits. For procurement purposes, the&#13;
major components of the project would be divided into six civil works components valued in total at&#13;
about US$29.1 million (Annex 4-4) separate in location and nature of work, two for transmission and&#13;
distribution pipelines, one for reservoir and secondary distribution improvements, one for rehabilitation&#13;
of the water treatment plant, one for upgrading the Kongo system, and one for sewerage works.&#13;
Contracts for these would be awarded after International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Equipment&#13;
valued at about US$6.1 million would also be procured through ICB. For the Guma diversion and&#13;
remedial works, hydrological investigations and for sanitation, the works would be minor; procurement&#13;
by Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) is proposed. LCB procedures, which include local advertising,&#13;
public bid opening, clearly stated evaluation criteria and award to the lowest evaluated bidder are&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Foreign firms would be allowed to participate. In addition, contracts for goods&#13;
which are available locally and valued at US$ 100,000 or less would be procured by LCB, the total&#13;
value being about US$200,000. The total value of LCB procurement would be about US$2.7 million&#13;
(US$2.5 million for civil works and US$0.2 million for goods) or 6% of the total project cost, with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
maximum contract value for works of US$1.0 million and an average of about US$0.3 million. Further&#13;
miscellaneous goods (such as maintenance tools, office equipment, vehicles, etc.) estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$50,000 per contract and not more than US$1.2 million in aggregate would be procured&#13;
through shopping with the evaluation of price quotations from at least three suppliers&#13;
4.14   Prior IDA review of advertisements, bidding documents, tender evaluations and&#13;
recommendations for award would be required for each ICB and LCB contract over US$100,000&#13;
equivalent in value, covering over 95% of the value of all contracts to be awarded. Smaller contracts&#13;
would be subject to post review. Consultants to be financed by IDA under the project would be&#13;
selected in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Agreement has&#13;
been obtained that the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Goods or Works under ICB and the&#13;
Standard Letter of Invitation Package for Consultant's Services will be used. Prior IDA review of the&#13;
consultant invitation package would be required for all contracts over US$100,000 in value for&#13;
consulting firns and US$10,000 for individual consultants. The credit would finance about 450 staff-&#13;
months of consultant services, including about 250 staff-months for construction supervision. As&#13;
discussed in paras. 4.5 and 4.9, GVWC and SLRA are equipped to plan, manage and monitor&#13;
procurement activities.&#13;
4.15   It is assumed that the credit will become effective by about August 1995, at which time&#13;
GVWC should be in a position to award the first contracts. A General Procurement Notice has already&#13;
been published in Development Business. The first draft bidding documents based on the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for Goods or Works as appropriate have been reviewed by IDA. The&#13;
following table summarizes the procurement arrangements which are shown in detail in Annex 4-4.&#13;

E. Disbursements&#13;
4.16   The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the following categories:&#13;
Allocation and Disbursement of IDA Credit&#13;
(US$ Million)&#13;
Category             IDA Amount        % to be Disbursed from IDA Credit&#13;
A. GVWC&#13;
1. Civil Works                  21.10      100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of&#13;
local expenditures&#13;
2. Goods and equipment           4.20      100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of&#13;
local expenditures&#13;
3. Consultant services and       5.40      100%&#13;
training&#13;
4. Unallocated                   3.60      -&#13;
Subtotal                      34.30&#13;

Total                           360&#13;
4.17   The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit is shown in Annex 4-5. It is&#13;
faster than the profile for Bank/IDA-financed water projects in Africa, which reflects the advanced&#13;
preparation and action taken to expcdite procurcmcnt in anticipation of the IDA credit as well as the&#13;
implementation arrangements that have been made. The closing date of the proposed credit would be&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;
4.18   Two special accounts, GVWC and SLRA, covering four months of eligible expenditures will&#13;
be established at commercial banks acccptable to IDA. The authorlzcd allocation for Fund-A (GVWC)&#13;
and Fund-B (SLRA) amount to US$0.8 million and US$0. I million, respectively. Upon effectiveness&#13;
of the credit, 50% of the initial dcposits will bc made available to cach special account, and the&#13;
remaining balance as needed. Replenishments of the spccial accounts should be made every two&#13;
months and must be fully documented except for contracts in a value of (i) less than US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent for civil works, (ii) less than US$50,000 equivalent for goods; and (iii) for services, less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
than $100,000 equivalent for consulting firms and less than $10,000 equivalent for individual&#13;
consultants, which may be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). GVWC and&#13;
SLRA will maintain all supporting documents in their respective offices for review by visiting&#13;
supervision missions and the extemal auditors.&#13;
F. Project Accounting and Auditinz&#13;
4,19   The accounting for project expenditures and special account transactions including statements&#13;
of expenditures would be maintained by GVWC and SLRA for their respective project components.&#13;
Agreement has been obtained that GVWC and SLRA will have the project accounts, special accounts&#13;
and statement of expenditures audited annually by qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA,&#13;
and that the audited accounts together with the auditors' reports will be submitted to IDA not later than&#13;
six months after the close of their fiscal/financial year.&#13;
G. Project Reporting. Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
4.20   GVWC and SLRA will each prepare quarterly progress reports covering all project&#13;
components within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will include: (i) progress&#13;
achieved against agreed implementation and disbursements schedules and key performance indicators;&#13;
and (ii) work programs and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project. The main&#13;
purpose of the reports will be to provide timely and updated information on implementation of project&#13;
components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on&#13;
progress in resolving previous recommendations. GVWC and SLRA will prepare a completion report&#13;
within six months of the final disbursement in accordance with IDA guidelines. Reporting&#13;
requirements and key performance indicators will be agreed with DOEP, SLRA and GVWC.&#13;
Agreement has been obtained that GVWC, DOEP and SLRA will submit to IDA copies of all&#13;
consultants' reports and studies financed under the proposed project.&#13;
4.21   Agreement has been obtained that GVWC will prepare a Project Implementation Manual prior&#13;
to the project launch workshop, i.e. by October 1, 1995, and that there will be a mid-term review by&#13;
IDA held two years from the date of credit effectiveness (i.e. by August 31, 1997) during which the&#13;
status of the entire project will be reviewed in detail. During this mid-term review, particular attention&#13;
will be paid to: (i) the compliance with covenants, particularly the financial and audit covenants; (ii) the&#13;
progress of implementation of the project components; (iii) the implementation of GVWC's water tariff&#13;
structure based on metered consumption; (iv) its components from the proposed project of water&#13;
svstems rehabilitation and cxpansion and institutional strengthening; and (v) the status of the drainage&#13;
and sanitation and sewerage components. The review will be jointly carried out with the Government,&#13;
DOEP, GVWC and SLRA. Corrective measures may be proposed as a result of this review including&#13;
necessary modifications in the scopc of the proposed project. The proposed supervision program for&#13;
the projcct and key performance indicators for monitoring the progress of the project are shown in&#13;
Annex 4-6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.22   All physical components of the proposed project will have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment of Greater Freetown. Increased water supply to the city and improvements to the existing&#13;
sewerage systems and sanitation will help improve personal hygiene and reduce health hazards.&#13;
4.23   An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been carried out to assess the environmental&#13;
impact of the project which is under Environmental Category B. This report was made available by the&#13;
Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) in Freetown in a number of places accessible to affected&#13;
groups and to local NGOs prior to project appraisal. GVWC has officially sent it to the Bank and is&#13;
available at the Public Information Center (PIC).&#13;
4.24   The EIA, summarized in Annex 4-7, addresses the environmental impact of the following&#13;
components of the proposed project: raising of Guma Dam spillway level; diversion of water from the&#13;
Little Guma catchment into the Guma Dam reservoir; and trunk distribution mains from Congo Cross&#13;
to Dan Street reservoir and from Africanus Road reservoir to Wellington reservoir. The environmental&#13;
impact study involved field survey, interviews and discussions with DOEP/GVWC personnel and local&#13;
inhabitants by a multidisciplinary team of GVWC's consultants. The EIA concluded that the&#13;
environmental impacts of raising the spillway level by 1.5m would be minimal since the reservoir has&#13;
already been cleared to the top level of the dam, some 2.5m higher than the new proposed level of the&#13;
spillway. Similarly, the impact of the diversion of water into the Guma Dam reservoir would also be&#13;
minimal as it is confined to cleared areas for the new diversion channel and loss of about 3.5 km of&#13;
intermittent stream beds of the diverted streams.&#13;
4.25   Neither of the two transmission pipelines will have any significant long-term environmental&#13;
impact. Following construction and reinstatement of all surfaces, the only visible evidence of the&#13;
pipelines existence will be valve chambers and short sections of exposed pipe where crossing the deeply&#13;
incised river valleys. Care would be taken when siting pipe fittings to ensure, as far as possible,&#13;
unobtrusive locations for any chambers, the covers of which should be flush with the road surface.&#13;
Exposed pipes would be protected against corrosion using bitumen-based paints with colors selected to&#13;
be unobtrusive and to blend with the surrounds.&#13;
4.26   The construction of trunk distribution mains and of sewerage system rehabilitation, would&#13;
cause temporary social disruptions. To keep the disturbances to a minimum in terms of magnitude and&#13;
time, as recommended by the EIA, GVWC will: (i) limit the amount of trench open at any time; (ii)&#13;
limit contractors' stringing operations to avoid long lengths of unlaid pipes strung by the roadside; (iii)&#13;
provide financial incentives within the contract for prompt temporary reinstatement of trenches; (iv)&#13;
restrict the dumping of trench spoil in unsuitable or inconvenient locations, and (v) ensure the provision&#13;
of road plates to enable trench crossing.&#13;
4.27   The impact of increased water supply to Wellington would be addressed by mobilizing&#13;
community involvement, providing technical support, and possibly enlisting the support of NGO(s), as&#13;
has been satisfactorily carried out in several West African cities to ensure proper drainage of sullage&#13;
water. Provision of funds for this support has been included in the proposed project.&#13;
4.28   The extension of the existing sewerage system will have no long-termn significant adverse&#13;
environmental impact, except for temporary social disruptions (para. 4.26). The construction of pipe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
sea outfalls to serve the immediate requirements of the city will provide significant environmental&#13;
improvements.&#13;

A. Past Financial Performance&#13;
5.1    A summary of GVWC's financial performance is highlighted in the table below and detailed in&#13;
Annexes 5-1 to 5-3. In reviewing GVWC's past financial performance, its financial statements have&#13;
also been restated in 1985 constant prices by reference to the annual average movement in the CPI&#13;

a/ Based on annual revaluation of fixed assets&#13;
5.2    The average annual revenue growth of 115% in nominal prices between 1982 and 1993 was&#13;
due mainly to tariff increases during this period. However, in real prices, revenues decreased by an&#13;
annual average of 8% between 1982 and 1991, which was attributable to the fall in volume of water&#13;
consumed and increased by 20% between 1992 and 1993 due to the 100% increase in the general water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
rates3. As water sales remains fairly constant between 1991 and 1993, the revenue increases of 149%&#13;
in 1992 and 22% in 1993 in real terms wcrc due to the tariff increase.&#13;
5.3    Over the same period, operating costs increased in nominal prices by an annual average of&#13;
50% . However, in real terms opcrating costs fell by 11 % between 1987 and 1991 and rose by 81% in&#13;
1992 and by 180% in 1993 due to the high electricity charges for pumping water to the hilly areas.&#13;
This fall in operating costs between 1987 and 1991 was due to shortage of foreign currency when&#13;
GVWC could not procure essential high cost items like chcmicals and spare parts. With the improved&#13;
financial and cashflow performance in 1992 and access to forcign currency, GVWC's importation of&#13;
chemicals increased by about 144% and spare parts by 267% from 1991.&#13;
5.4    The company had an annual average of Le 4 million in operating income in 1985 Leones (Le&#13;
229 million in nominal prices) between 1987 and 1993. The total net losses of Le 2.2 billion for period&#13;
1987 to 1993 were due to the exchange losscs totalling Le 2.3 billion resulting from massive&#13;
devaluations of the Leone (from Le 25 per US$1.0 in 1987 to Le 575 in 1993). The return on average&#13;
net fixed assets in operation on revalued basis increased from 4% in 1987 to 12% in 1988 and declined&#13;
to an annual average of 5% between 1989 and 1991, before increasing to 10% in 1992. The rate of&#13;
return on revalued assets basis in 1993 was about -4% due to increased operating costs including&#13;
electricity and chemicals (para. 5.3).&#13;
5.5    As agreed under the FIRP, a debt restructuring program was effected to enable GVWC to&#13;
service its debt obligations without causing undue liquidity problems. As a result, GVWC has been&#13;
able to settle in full its outstanding debt obligations to the ADB of US$92,727.27.&#13;
B. Water Tariffs&#13;
5.6    Currently water charges are based on the volume of water consumed for metered connections,&#13;
mainly for commercial and industrial customers and on property values for the non-metered domestic&#13;
customer. The metered customers currently pay Le 2500/1000 Ig (US$4.50/1000 Ig) while the non-&#13;
metered domestic pay Le 30 of annual rateable value. The present tariff structure ensures the metered&#13;
customers cross-subsidize the unmetered domestic consumers by contributing about 86% of total&#13;
revenue for consuming only 10% of the water sold. The trend in tariffs is provided in the tariff history&#13;
in the Annex 5-4.&#13;
5.7    While the metered tariffs maintained an upward trend between 1989-92, the non-metered&#13;
actually declined by 20% in 1991 from US$0.05/100lOg to US$0.04/lOOOIg before increasing again to&#13;
the 1990 levels of US$0.05/lOOOIg in 1992 and falling to US$0.03/1000 Ig in 1993. As covenanted&#13;
under the FIRP project (Cr. 2511 -SL), GVWC increased the water charges for non-metered domestic&#13;
customers from Le 10 to Le 20 of annual rateable value (ARV) effective November 1, 1993 and&#13;
subsequently to Le 30 effective November 1, 1994. Since the metered commercial/industrial customers&#13;
already bear an unproportionately high contribution to revenues, the tariff for this group remained&#13;
unchanged.&#13;
3 The consultants' report prepared in 1994 estimated the levels of leakage within the supply system to be&#13;
approximately 50%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
5.8    Under the FIRP (Cr. 251 1-SL), it was covenantcd that the universal metering program will be&#13;
introduccd and GVWC will implement a new tariff structure based on metercd consumption, to be&#13;
agreed with IDA and cffcctive from November I, 1994. A key clement of this universal metering&#13;
system is to ensure accessibility to watcr and affordability especially by domestic consumers.&#13;
Although GVWC took actions to comply with this covcnant, the metering program was suspended in&#13;
October 1994 due to public reaction. Agreements have been reached with GOSL and GVWC during&#13;
the negotiations that: (a) GVWC will resume the metering of domestic water supply by July 1, 1995,&#13;
and complete the installation of meters for existing domestic connections by March 31, 1996; (b)&#13;
GVWC will implement a water tariff structure based on metered consumption by December 31, 1995&#13;
and adjust tariffs from time to timc to enable the company to cam a rate of return on average revalued&#13;
net fixed assets in operations of not less than I% in 1995/96, 2% in 1996/97, 4% in 1997/98, 6% in&#13;
1998/99, and 8% in 1999/2000 and thereafter. Thc rate of return covenant will be reviewed with&#13;
GVWC during the mid-term review taking into consideration the actual data on water consumption and&#13;
revenues resulting from the new tariff structure as wcll as GVWC's financial needs.&#13;
5.9    As mentioned in para. 2.14, once the scwcrage operations have been transferred from DOEP to&#13;
GVWC, the sewerage charges to bc put in effect by GVWC will be sufficient to meet annually, at the&#13;
minimum, the cash operating expenses (i.e. before depreciation) and debt scrvice related to its sewerage&#13;
operations. The sewerage charges, which are currently based on rateable values of the connected&#13;
properties, are expected to be based on the volume of water consumed.&#13;
C. Billing! and Collection&#13;
5.10   The results of the study on the organization/operation and water tariff/finances of GVWC&#13;
revealed inadequacies in the current meter reading, billing and collection system. The receivables&#13;
between 1989 and 1992 were, 284, 184, 106 and 180 days of average billings, respectively. The&#13;
receivables wcre reduced to 70 days of billing at the end of 1993, due to the prepayment by the GOSL&#13;
(para. 5.19). To remedy the situation, GVWC has established a Commercial Division responsible for&#13;
meter reading, billing, collection and customer services. GVWC's receivables position is likely to&#13;
improve due to recent settlement of the Government's arrears and Government's agreement to make&#13;
payment within 30 days of billings. Furthermore, when universal metering becomes effective in early&#13;
1996, collections will be rigorously pursued through disconnection measures which will extend to&#13;
government agencies. GVWC's disconnection unit will be enhanced as part of implementing the&#13;
recommendations of the above study.&#13;
5.11   A chief meter reader has been appointed with the specific role of ensuring that the billing&#13;
system is functioning efficiently, in particular that (i) all metered consumers are billed with correct&#13;
information, (ii) meter reading is carried out timely enough to allow for monthly billings and; (iii) all&#13;
malfunctioning meters are repaired promptly. The large number of existing customers, 35,000,&#13;
including some 12,000 with private connections, and the forecast population growth of Freetown&#13;
requires that the billing system be modernized through computerization. As provided under the FIRP,&#13;
GVWC has computerized its billing system efective November 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
D. Accountine and Auditing&#13;
5. 12   The current accounting and reporting system will be overhauled during computerization as&#13;
proposed by the above study. The study confirms that though the current annual and semi-annual&#13;
financial statements, budget projections, income statement and supporting schedules are adequate for&#13;
routine reporting requirements, they do not yield adequate management information. The proposed&#13;
computerization of the accounting system (Phase II computerization program to be financed under the&#13;
proposed project) is intended to ensure that: (i) annual budgets which are currently only used annually&#13;
should be reported periodically with all the variances explained and necessary actions taken, (ii) cash&#13;
flow requirements should be monitored and reviewed regularly, (iii) cost data produced should be used&#13;
by management for determining the cost of water produced and as a basis for cost cutting measures,&#13;
(iv) stores and inventory management should be accurate and accounted for with the expansion of the&#13;
operations of GVWC; (v) fixed asset acquisitions and disposals should be properly accounted for and&#13;
recorded; and (vi) an operational budget should provide a strong preventive maintenance program.&#13;
5.13    GVWC has consistently had its audited reports completed within six months of its financial&#13;
year end of October 31. It was agreed under the FIRP (Cr. 2511 -SL) that GVWC will submit to IDA&#13;
its annual audited accounts, together with the auditors' report not later than six months after the close&#13;
of the year. Such annual accounts and long audit reports will also include the project accounts, special&#13;
accounts and statements of expenditure. This covenant will be repeated under the proposed project.&#13;
GVWC will computerize the accounting system to ensure the above objectives are achieved as part of&#13;
the Phase II computerization program.&#13;
E. GVWC's Financing Plan&#13;
5.14   GVWC's estimated financial requirements during the execution period of the proposed project&#13;

requirement.&#13;
F. Financial Proiections&#13;
5.16   The financial projections for years 1994 to 2000 together with supporting assumptions are&#13;

5.17   The above annual revenue increases reflect levels of tariffs which would be required to achieve&#13;
the above return on average annually revalued fixed assets in operation. GVWC's unaccounted-for-&#13;
water of approximately 50% - 54% is due mainly to the physical leakage (pipe leaks and storage tank&#13;
overflows). However, GVWC's commitment to a sound leakage detection program is demonstrated in&#13;
the leakage detection and repair component in the FIRP which is ahead of schedule. Consultants'&#13;
evaluation indicates that by year 1999 the unaccounted-for-water will have reached 30%. Through the&#13;
FIRP, a maintenance unit would be rehabilitated in order to continue the leakage detection program on&#13;
a systematic basis. The percentage of reduction in unaccounted-for-water assumed in the projections is&#13;
in line with actual results in Africa. The detailed assumptions underlying the tariffs and water loss&#13;
reduction are shown in Annex 5-8.&#13;
5.18   The taxation of GVWC with effect from April 1, 1993 resulted in tax liability of Le 8 million&#13;
in 1993. Tax regulations in Sierra Leone require a quarterly tax charge of 4.25% on gross revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
This would be the minimum annual tax charge. The operating ratio for the period 1994 to year 2000&#13;
has an annual average of 0.83 (sound financial management requires this ratio to be less than 1)4. The&#13;
negative operating ratios from 1993 takes into account the depreciation on revalued assets. The large&#13;
increase in depreciation reflects the Leone devaluation since the last fixed asset revaluation in 1986.&#13;
Subsequent annual depreciation charges continue to rise due to annual revaluations in line with the&#13;
estimated Leone devaluation and the increase in capital expenditures arising from both the FIRP and&#13;
the proposed Urban Water Supply project. It was agreed under the FIRP (Cr. 2511 -SL) that GVWC's&#13;
fixed assets would be revalued annually. This covenant w,ill be repeated under this project.&#13;
5.19   The net operating loss in 1994 would be due to the increase in depreciation charges of Le 462&#13;
million which results from the fixed assets revaluation. The improving operating position of the&#13;
company in the period 1995 to 2000 is reflected by the annual increase in operating income. The&#13;
return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation would improve from a negative return of 2.4%&#13;
in 1994 to 1.3% in 1995, rising to 8.0% in 2000, and GVWC would finance 23% of its FY95-99&#13;
invcstment program from its internal cash generation. With the Government's agreement to pay off all&#13;
arrears prior to negotiations and to settle water bills within 30 days of billings (para, 5.10) and with&#13;
GVWC's ability to use disconnection to improvc collections aftcr universal metering is completed by&#13;
March 1996, the company is expected to mect the covenant under the FIRP project (Cr. 251 1-SL) to&#13;
reduce receivables to 90 days in 1995 and 60 days thercafter. This covenant will be repeated under this&#13;
project. The actual 70 days receivables in 1993 is duc to a prepaymcnt by the GOSL in error for its&#13;
water charges to GVWC.&#13;
5.20   The high debt to equity ratio of 3.5:1 in 1992 falls to 2:1 in 1993 with the conversion of the&#13;
Caisse Centrale debt to equity and falls cven further to 0.4:1 in 1994 when GVWC revalues its fixed&#13;
assets and pays off the ADF loan of US$92,727.27 and commences dcbt service of all the outstanding&#13;
loans. The increase in borrowing, including the IDA credit for the FIRP water supply component and&#13;
the IDA financing of the proposed project, results in higher debt-equity ratio averaging 0.7:1 during&#13;
1995-2000. GVWC agreed under Credit 2511 -SL to maintain a debt service coverage of not less than&#13;
1.5 times and this covenant xvill be repeatcd under this project.&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
6.1    The recently launched IDA-financed FIRP (Cr. 251 1-SL approved by IDA in June 1993)&#13;
includes provisions to improve the opcrations of GVWC through leak detection and repairs and&#13;
univcrsal metering, and to carry out studics to updatc the Water Master Plan and review the&#13;
organization, management and finances of GVWC. As a follow-up to the FIRP, the proposed Urban&#13;
Water Supply Project would improve and modernize the management and operations of GVWC and&#13;
rchabilitatc and expand its water supply systems. Dircct projcct bencfits include increasing the&#13;
quantity, quality and reliability of watcr supplics in Frcetown, thercby improving public hcalth. Water&#13;
would also be available to meet the dcmands of commercial and industrial users, thus removing an&#13;
obstacle to the development of these scctors, and permitting the dcvelopment of urban areas as centers&#13;
of economic growth. The project would rcducc pcr unit opcrating costs and improve the operating&#13;
efficiency of GVWC. It would improve the managcment ability and pcrformancc of the company,&#13;
4IBRD Water and Sanitation Utilities Study: June 1, 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
thereby raising their public image, a prerequisite to encouraging consumers to pay for their water&#13;
supply. It would develop the GVWC into a self-supporting and sustainable entity with realistic long-&#13;
term development perspectives. The proposed project Nvould also defer the costly construction of the&#13;
additional water supply of Orugu Dam which the company and the country can ill afford at this time.&#13;
The proposed project would also develop an institutional framework to improve urban water supply&#13;
operations by carrying out an organization and finance study for SLWC and the water operations in the&#13;
other major towns and water master plan studies for these towns. It will also improve sanitary&#13;
facilities and the rehabilitation of the existing sewerage system in Freetown. The construction of sea&#13;
outfalls would also improve environmental conditions.&#13;
B. Povertv Alleviation&#13;
6.2    The proposed project would have a direct impact on poverty in Freetown, by improving the&#13;
health, hygiene and capacity for economic activitv of the people including the poor sections in the City.&#13;
Direct employment opportunities would be available in the rehabilitation and expansion of water&#13;
supply systems and improvements in the drainage and sanitation, most of which will be undertaken by&#13;
local contractors and/or subcontractors. Four out of every ten Sierra Leoneans do not have access to&#13;
safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities. The proposed project would not only ensure&#13;
accessibility to clean treated potable water by thcsc disadvantaged levels of society but would also&#13;
allow affordability through a "lifeline" tariff structure. The medium and long-term strategic plans will&#13;
enable future investments in water supply and low cost sanitation to be targeted much more accurately&#13;
towards economically disadvantaged groups offering further opportunities for poverty alleviation.&#13;
C. Economic Analysis&#13;
6.3    Economic analysis shown on Annex 6-1 has been carried out for the GVWC water supply&#13;
component which accounts for more than 80 percent of the physical works under the project. Benefits&#13;
include (a) the incremental volume of water available for distribution to consumers valued at an&#13;
average water rate which will be effective in 1994/95 when the initial benefit of the works begin to&#13;
accrue, and (b) the prescnt value of the deferred capital outlay of the long term works (Orugu Dam)&#13;
resulting from the implementation of the FIRP projcct and the proposed projcct. This capital outlay&#13;
has becn deferred from year 2000 to year 2005. The incremental volume of water includes the savings&#13;
of water losses resulting from the ongoing leakage dctection program and rehabilitation/replacement of&#13;
dilapidated distribution systems included in the project. as wcll as additional water resulting from&#13;
increased sources, improved treatment and ncw transmission and distribution systems, especially to the&#13;
eastern parts of Greater Freetown. All costs rclatcd to the Icakagc detection and rcpair program were&#13;
added to the costs of the proposed GVWC watcr supply component, and adjusted for duties and taxes&#13;
and a general conversion factor of 0.93 for Sierra Leone&#13;
6.4    The economic rate of return is estimated at 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate that with a 10%&#13;
increase in costs, rate of return would be 7% and wvith a 1()°/0 reduction in the volume of water saved,&#13;
the rate of return would be 7.4%. A combination of 1O% increase in costs and 10% reduction in the&#13;
volume of water saved would lower the ratc of return to 7%. This rate of return understates the full&#13;
benefits to arisc from the future increase in tariffs as the delivcry of wvatcr scrvices improve with the&#13;
implemcntation of the above components. In addition, the cconomic rate of return does not take&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
account of the benefits from positive externalities such as improved health and productivity as the&#13;
result of the better availability and quality of water cannot be quantified.&#13;
D. Proiect Risks&#13;
6.5    The main project risk is associated with the capacity of GVWC and SLRA to implement their&#13;
respective project components. GVWC, with its long history of capable technical performance and its&#13;
successful implementation of the water supply component of the ongoing FIRP (Credit 251 1-SL), is&#13;
expected to manage well the implementation of the water supply component of the proposed project.&#13;
To make use of existing and proven capability, DOEP will employ GVWC through a management&#13;
services contract to implement, on its behalf, its sewerage component. SLRA has demonstrated its&#13;
capability in implementing its various components under the FIRP project, will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the sanitation sub-component. Another main risk is related to the availability of&#13;
counterpart funding. GVWC's financial projections indicate that GVWC would be able to generate&#13;
sufficient funds to meet its counterpart obligations. For the other project components, as for the FIRP,&#13;
the Government would be required to make agreed initial deposits into project accounts to be&#13;
established before credit effectiveness and to make quarterly deposits into this account during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
6.6    For the longer term, GVWC may face the risk of sustaining its viability in the light of the fact&#13;
that most water utilities in Africa face severe operational and financial difficulties. This risk would be&#13;
minimized through the Government's and Bank's continued support for the autonomy of GVWC and&#13;
modernization and strengthening of GVWC's operations under the proposed project, and through the&#13;
development and implementation under the project of a strategy for increasing private sector&#13;
participation in water opcrations. The low-cost sanitation component has an element of risk associated&#13;
with the difficulty of promoting and sustaining community-based activities. This risk is being reduced&#13;
by using the same implementing agency (SLRA) that has gained pertinent experience through the&#13;
implementation of the urban upgrading components of the FIRP and by ensuring the involvement and&#13;
commitment of the communities. The security situation in Sierra Leone, if deteriorated in the future,&#13;
may also affect project implementation especially in the carrying out of the water master plans and&#13;
organization and finance study for major towns outside Greater Freetown.&#13;

USA&#13;
Dear Mr. Preston,&#13;
RE: SIERRA LEONE'S WATER SECTOR POLICIES&#13;
We have been working with your staff on the Urban Water Supply Project which&#13;
is due to go to the IDA Board in March 1995. In order to place this project in its proper&#13;
policy context and in advance of its Board presentation, we are writing to inform the&#13;
International Development Association of the initiatives we are taking in the water supply&#13;
sector in Sierra Leone. The government attaches high priority to the sector's role in&#13;
increasing human welfare and economic growth. This letter highlights the sectors main&#13;
constraints and the government's strategies to address them. This policy and strategy&#13;
framework will be used to underpin the design and implementation of the proposed IDA&#13;
supported Urban Water Supply project, as well as other donor supported projects.&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
During the first decade after independence in 1961, the economy of Sierra Leone&#13;
grew at about 4 percent and averaged over 3 percent GDP growth in the first half of the&#13;
seventies. Thereafter, the economic situation deteriorated sharply and GDP growth&#13;
slowed down to about 1 percent a year in the period 1975-80. Budgetary revenues fell&#13;
and major cuts in capital expenditures followed. Investments in social and physical&#13;
infrastructure and maintenance virtually ceased, causing rapid decay in existing facilities.&#13;
In 1989, the government adopted a reform program aimed at stabilizing the economy.&#13;
This included liberalization of the exchange rate and trade, decontrol of prices and&#13;
interest rates, strengthening of revenue collection and expenditure controls, and a&#13;
revamping of mining and fisheries policies. Rehabilitation of infrastructure has also&#13;
begun, with support from IDA and other official multilateral and bilateral agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-                                        Annex 2-1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
The government's broad development objectives are to stabilize the economy and&#13;
create a macroeconomic and sectoral environment conducive to sustained growth and&#13;
poverty reduction. The success of macroeconomic policies will be demonstrated by&#13;
generation of increased production and poverty reduction. To re-establish and maintain&#13;
serviceable levels. This requires large investments in rehabilitation, and strengthened&#13;
institutional mechanisms to maintain newly rehabilitated facilities. Within the water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector, rehabilitation and improvements have begun with assistance&#13;
from IDA, and the Africa Development Bank will join IDA in future programs.&#13;
An initial assessment of the environment and resource management points to the&#13;
existence of significant environmental problems across all sectors, particularly in respect&#13;
of access to water, sanitation and health impact. Access to basic health services, safe&#13;
drinking water and health and sanitation are out of reach of the majority of the&#13;
population. At most 10 percent of the rural population and 60 percent of the urban&#13;
population has access to drinking water. Deficient water supplies are a serious&#13;
environmental problem because of their effect on human welfare and economic growth.&#13;
In Freetown's Kroo Bay area, 30 percent of childhood deaths are caused by diarrhea and&#13;
25 percent by malaria both associated with stagnant or polluted water and solid waste&#13;
contamination. The benefits of target interventions can be measured in terms of reduced&#13;
medical costs and increased productivity. The revival of the urban economy is essential if&#13;
urban centers are to serve as the nucleus of growth in the economic recovery of the rural&#13;
areas and the country as a whole.&#13;
There has been almost no investment in the water sector for several years due to&#13;
the economic problems facing the country. The neglect of operations and maintenance of&#13;
the water infrastructure eroded the existing production capacity and increased the loss of&#13;
water in the distribution network. The resulting shortages in supply due to dysfunctional&#13;
systems have created large backlog in demand, over an above the new demand generated&#13;
by the growth of population and economic recovery. The government's objectives for the&#13;
water sector are to provide adequate water of acceptable quality in both urban and rural&#13;
areas, to deliver potable water to 50 percent of the rural and 100 percent of the urban&#13;
population by the end of the decade, to ensure physical, financial and institutional&#13;
sustainability of the rehabilitated systems, and to improve access of low income areas to&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this regard it is necessary to determine which&#13;
investments in water and sanitation should be marketed at full cost and in which cases&#13;
public funds should be used where there are extensive communal benefits for low income&#13;
groups.&#13;
To achieve the above objectives, the government's main strategies include: repair&#13;
and rehabilitation of water production and distribution systems, strengthening and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

building the institutional capacity of water utilities to meet the water needs of rural and&#13;
urban areas, to ensure sustainable water operations, improve the financial viability of&#13;
water companies, and to repair and expand gradually the existing sewerage system. The&#13;
government has been implementing these strategies through policy and investment&#13;
programs financed by IDA such as the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study (1983),&#13;
on the ongoing Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP) (1993), and the&#13;
proposed Urban Water Supply Project (UWSP). The last two address the most&#13;
immediate water needs of the capital, Freetown, which houses 22 percent of the total&#13;
population.&#13;
STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS&#13;
Access to Water Supply. In the short and medium term the government is seeking to&#13;
improve access to water supply through increased supplies and demand side&#13;
management. The water supply components under FIRP and UWSP increase the supply&#13;
of water through rehabilitation of the production facilities and reduction in leakage in&#13;
the distribution system of Freetown managed by the Guma Valley Water Company&#13;
(GVWC). On the demand side, the ongoing universal metering of water connections in&#13;
Freetown is expected to promote water conservation by consumers. At the same time,&#13;
more standpipes will be provided by GVWC to ensure access to water especially in the&#13;
areas where metered connections are not practicable. The water systems in the urban&#13;
centers of Bo, Kenema and Makeni have recently been brought back into operation using&#13;
our own resources but they are in urgent need of further rehabilitation. They are the&#13;
responsibility of the Sierra Leone Water Company (SLWC) and will be the subject of&#13;
studies under the proposed UWSP. Water supply in the rest of the country is the&#13;
responsibility of the Water Supply Division in the Department of Energy and Power.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening. Under FIRP and the proposed project, the management and&#13;
operations of GVWC, which is an autonomous public utility, are being modernized and&#13;
strengthened. It is our intention to preserve the autonomy of GVWC. The establishment&#13;
of autonomous, self-supporting water utilities for urban areas outside Freetown is also&#13;
under consideration. These may be set up on the pattern of GVWC and/or the local&#13;
private sector may be involved via management service contracts to manage these&#13;
systems. Former employees of GVWC would be potential candidates for such contracts.&#13;
The water supply systems in the Northern Province are currently being managed under a&#13;
management contract supported by a grant from the European Economic Community.&#13;
We are currently exploring the feasibility of community owned and managed water&#13;
supply systems in rural and semi-urban areas. We will continue to seek the support of&#13;
the international donor community to supplement our own efforts in these areas. In&#13;
order to improve the operations of the existing sewerage systems in Freetown, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-                                        Annex 2-1&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
government and GVWC are committed to transfer the responsibility for this sewerage&#13;
system from the Department of Energy and Power (DOEP) to GVWC. This transfer will&#13;
be effective not later than July 1997, taking into consideration the time required for&#13;
GVWC to complete its organization and management modernization/improvement&#13;
program, to carry out in the next two years the heaviest workload of implementing the&#13;
FIRP and the proposed project, and to plan and implement the various steps prerequisite&#13;
of this transfer.&#13;
Cost Recovery and Financial Viability. The tariff structure for water use in Freetown is&#13;
currently being revised to ensure both cost recovery and financial viability of the Guma&#13;
Valley Water Company. The block tariffs build into their structure the incremental cost&#13;
of supplying additional units of water and incorporate incentives to conserve water use.&#13;
While the tariff structure will reflect the cost of operations and capital investments, a&#13;
"lifeline tariff" will be charged to the poorest consumers to allow them access to basic&#13;
needs at an affordable price. The tariff structure in the sector will be fixed in real terms&#13;
to allow for inflationary changes, and in order to allow gradual adjustment of domestic&#13;
consumer expectations and behaviour, the new tariff rates in Freetown, in particular,&#13;
will be applied gradually each year over the next 3 years. The new tariffs will reduce the&#13;
present large cross-subsidization between the industrial and commercial consumers and&#13;
the domestic sector. To maximize health benefits from more and better quality water, it&#13;
is necessary for the public to understand the relation between water usage and disease&#13;
incidence. To promote such understanding we will undertake public education campaigns&#13;
which will also provide information on the need to pay for water. The combined efforts&#13;
on the supply and demand sides will, we expect, allow us to defer the prohibitive expense&#13;
of constructing Orugu Dam, an alternate source of water supply for the Greater&#13;
Freetown Area. In the water companies to be established in other urban centers also, the&#13;
government is committed to promoting commercial operations with consideration for&#13;
basic water needs of the poor.&#13;
Sanitation. An initial effort at addressing the health and sanitation conditions in&#13;
Freetown in being made under FIRP. In its slum upgrading component, FIRP includes&#13;
the provision of waste collection and disposal facilities and ablution facilities particularly&#13;
in the low income areas. These efforts are being extended in the proposed project, which&#13;
will be community-based and demand driven. The proposed project also strengthens the&#13;
sewerage department and repairs and expands, on pilot basis, the existing sewerage&#13;
system. These initial steps, it is hoped, will maximize benefits from existing facilities and&#13;
stimulate future development of the Freetown sewerage systems.&#13;
Investment and Expenditure Policy. Due to absence of proper planning and funding in&#13;
the previous years, there have been no structured investment and expenditure policy in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-                                       Annex 2-1&#13;

the sector. However, the Government will ensure that future investment should be based&#13;
on clearly defined economic considerations and maintenance will receive the highest&#13;
priority over rehabilitation or expansion.&#13;
Regulatory Framework. At present, GVWC is completely autonomous with respect to&#13;
investment expenditures and tariff setting. The rest of the sector, which is operated by&#13;
the Water Division of DOEP and the Sierra Leone Water Company (SLWC), is under&#13;
the control of DOEP. The regulatory framework for the water sector will be reviewed&#13;
under the Organization, Management and Finance Study (for the water sector outside&#13;
Freetown). To be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
Private Sector Participation. In order to promote efficiency in the water sector, the&#13;
government is committed to involve the private sector in the water utilities operations&#13;
wherever possible. To ensure an orderly transition to private sector involvement in the&#13;
sector, a study will be financed under the proposed Urban Water Supply Project on&#13;

SIERRA LEONE&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION COMPONENT&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Environmental sanitation (sullage disposal, drainage, human and solid waste&#13;
management) in urban areas has become a major issue, as urban populations continue to grow&#13;
at high rates and the need for provision of adequate services becomes more pressing. The&#13;
Wellington area of Freetown will be receiving its first distribution system. Hence, there is a&#13;
need to ensure that the water being brought in does not create an additional environmental&#13;
burden. Management of sanitation is divided up among several agencies although the limits&#13;
of responsibility are not clearly defined. The key agencies are the ministries responsible for&#13;
water and health and the Freetown City Council (FCC). Several others play limited roles.&#13;
2.     There are two main ways in which sullage (kitchen and bath water) currently is&#13;
disposed of. The majority of owners drain their sullage out into the adjacent pathway where&#13;
it eventually finds its way into public drains which are often blocked by garbage, weeds and&#13;
sediment. Other homes tend to dispose of their sullage on site either by surface spreading or&#13;
in seepage pits. Off site disposal results in ponded water and muddy pathways that make&#13;
walking difficult and allow mosquitos to breed. Human waste is disposed of by pit latrines&#13;
and by septic tanks/vaults with soakaways. There is sewerage in only the old central part of&#13;
Freetown. Garbage is a problem since only a limited collection system has been established.&#13;
It is generally dumped at official or unofficial sites. Existing water sources are surface&#13;
waters, a few open wells, standpipes and house connections. Surface waters and well water&#13;
are usually highly polluted and management of standpipe sites is usually inadequate.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.    The primary objective of the environmental sanitation component is to reduce possible&#13;
adverse environmental effects caused by the water which will be brought into the Wellington&#13;
area of Freetown by the project. In order to achieve this: (i) provision will be made for&#13;
wastewater disposal and management of new water points; (ii) extension agents will be trained&#13;
to better promote improved environmental sanitation; (iii) planning activities will be carried&#13;
out to improve existing domestic sanitation management practices including human waste,&#13;
sullage disposal, stormwater drainage, and solid waste; and (iv) support will be provided for&#13;
the organization of neighborhood user groups. In doing this, special attention will be paid to&#13;
increasing the skills of sector staff and local consultants in working on sanitation issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
Methodologv&#13;
4.    The sanitation planning, promotion and hygiene education activities will be&#13;
implemented by a full time, multi-disciplinary team of sector personnel (Government and&#13;
NGO) and two long term consultants (engineer and community development expert) based in&#13;
a lead agency such as FCC. The team will be supported by an advisory committee&#13;
comprising sector agencies involved in environmental sanitation management and short term&#13;
local and international consultants. Subsequent to completion of the activities described in the&#13;
component, the local teams will be in a position to continue planning activities, assisting other&#13;
urban areas and coordinating and monitoring implementation of new projects. Detailed terms&#13;
of reference for each member of the team as well as the consultants will be jointly prepared in&#13;
an initiating workshop attended by Government officials, NGOs, special consultants and Bank&#13;
specialists. There will be two components, one aimed at developing policies and broad&#13;
guidelines for promulgation by the Government, and one aimed specifically at improving&#13;
sanitary conditions in the Wellington area.&#13;
5.    It will be necessary to ensure that standpipes sites include appropriate drainage&#13;
(soakaways or trenches for the wastewater produced at the water point) and that buildings&#13;
with direct connections have appropriately dimensioned soakaways or trenches. Same&#13;
households which have multiple taps have adequate wastewater disposal through septic tanks&#13;
and infiltration trenches but for others, infiltration trenches function poorly, and effluent finds&#13;
its way to surface drains. Means of ameliorating this situation are needed. Sound&#13;
management of standpipes to ensure that the water points are not vandalized and that the&#13;
surrounds are kept clean can be achieved by several means to be decided upon. Sub-&#13;
contracting or franchising of the standpipes to private citizens to sell water, or putting in place&#13;
a workable maintenance and management system which will be the responsibility of GVWC,&#13;
are two options.&#13;
6.    The promotion and hygiene education activities will include providing additional&#13;
training skills and tools to health inspectors and extension agents so that they can promote the&#13;
new water supplies and encourage better water use practices and proper disposal of sullage&#13;
including on-site soakaways and the upkeep of community drains. Sanitation planning will&#13;
consist of first reviewing existing conditions, institutional arrangements, policy and legislative&#13;
provisions, technology choice, financing and the willingness of the population to pay for&#13;
services, and social and cultural conditions. Subsequently additional work will result in&#13;
recommendations on policies, guidelines and actions that can be taken to improve&#13;
environmental sanitation conditions.&#13;
7.    To promote efficiency and accountability to consumers, neighborhoods will be&#13;
assisted, possibly through NGO involvement to organize themselves into user groups to be&#13;
able to: (a) aggregate and communicate their preferences for service, technology choice and&#13;
how much they are willing to pay for their preferences to the GVWC (or to those planning&#13;
the new services); (b) mobilize and contribute resources (cash and/or in-kind resources)&#13;
towards capital, operation and maintenance costs; and (c) hold the GVWC and other service&#13;
providers accountable for the quality of service they provide.&#13;

Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
I. Sanitation Management Guidelines&#13;
8.    In order to assist better management of sanitation services, it will be necessary to&#13;
develop clear guidelines and policies on the responsibilities of the various institutions involved&#13;
in the sub-sector, as well as on technology choice, financial and legislative issues and on the&#13;
role of the population. It is important that the guidelines for management of the sanitation&#13;
(human solid waste management, sullage disposal, and storm water drainage) services are&#13;
prepared by government officials who will be responsible for updating them. A team of&#13;
government officials from the relevant agencies and long term consultants will therefore&#13;
conduct a study to develop the guidelines. These terms of reference therefore describe the&#13;
work to be done and indicate where consultants will be required to assist in its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
9.     The main phases of the work to be conducted which will lead to recommendations to&#13;
be adopted by Government, are as follows:&#13;
(a)    review of existing sanitation conditions in Freetown including levels of&#13;
service, and coverage;&#13;
(b)    detailed analysis (organizational structure, human and financial resources,&#13;
equipment, roles) of the institutions (public and private including NGOs)&#13;
involved in providing sanitation services;&#13;
(c)    sanitation survey in representative parts of Freetown, including information on&#13;
types of excreta and sullage systems used by the population, water supply&#13;
sources, how much they pay for collection and disposal of solid and human&#13;
waste and other related services, how such services are organized, preferences&#13;
and thoughts about existing alternative services, determination of the&#13;
willingness to pay for improved services. The survey will be based on&#13;
representative sampling and will require preparation of a questionnaire,&#13;
definition of a sampling procedure, identification and training of enumerators&#13;
and their supervisors and development of a database to process the results;&#13;
(d)    review of actual financing mechanisms for services (loans, subsidies, etc.) and&#13;
options for cost recovery and review of existing policies, legislation, edicts&#13;
and regulations and on the basis of actual need;&#13;
(e)    review of current technologies used and recommendations on criteria for&#13;
technology choice for the collection, treatment and disposal of human and&#13;
solid waste, sullage, and stormwater; and&#13;
(f)    recommendations to be acted on by Government for new policy decisions and&#13;
guidelines on institutional, financial, and technical aspects reviewed in order&#13;
to improve management of services.&#13;

Roles of Consultants, Timing, and Reporting&#13;
10.   It is expected that this study will take six months. Two long term local consultants&#13;
(part of the project team) will be responsible for coordinating activities, providing technical&#13;
assistance to the teams and assisting with report writing. An expert consultant will be&#13;
required for 2 months to assist with the sanitation survey and additional input will be required&#13;
from other short term local consultants.&#13;
II. Sullage Disposal, Drainage and Sanitation Plans&#13;
11.    The additional standpipes and house connections to be introduced into the Wellington&#13;
areas as a result of the project will need to be better managed than the ones currently in place.&#13;
Furthermore, improved disposal of the wastewater produced is needed. Solid waste&#13;
management is an important aspect to consider since poor management often contributes to&#13;
drainage and wastewater disposal problems.&#13;
Scope of the Work&#13;
A.    Analysis of the Existing Situation&#13;
12.    A review will be made of actual sanitation services in the Wellington area including&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)    Existing water supply and sanitation facilities (domestic (individual or&#13;
communal), commercial, industrial). Assessment of completed, current and&#13;
planned waste treatment and disposal facilities (and projects). Current needs&#13;
for sanitation and the deficiencies in sanitation services.&#13;
(b)    Determination of the costs of the different levels of sanitation service, who&#13;
pays for services and what are the current financing mechanisms.&#13;
(c)    Review of the status, operation and responsibilities of agencies and&#13;
organizations involved in the provision of individual and communal sanitation&#13;
services including their institutional, human resource, operation and&#13;
maintenance capabilities and financial situation.&#13;
(d)    Review of the current involvement of the private sector NGOs and the&#13;
population in sanitation services, for example septic tank emptying,&#13;
construction of on-site excreta disposal and soakaway systems, construction&#13;
and management of communal facilities, collection of garbage, construction&#13;
and cleansing of drains, and an assessment for the capacity of the private&#13;
sector for participation improving sanitation services.&#13;
(e)    Examination of housing types and densities, demographic, socio-economic and&#13;
industrial growth patterns and population growth projections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(f)    Review of neighborhood, topographical and drainage maps and aerial&#13;
photographs and environmental considerations including soil and groundwater&#13;
conditions.&#13;
(g)    Review of legal and policy guidelines as well as options for enforcement of&#13;
regulations.&#13;
(h)    Review of community organizations that may exist in the Wellington area to&#13;
include the types of organizations (whether based on neighborhoods, gender,&#13;
religion, ethnic origin, etc.), rules governing behavior within the&#13;
organizations, how the organizations relate to other bodies, methods of&#13;
conflict resolution, and mechanisms for providing rewards and sanctions.&#13;
B.     Technologv Options&#13;
13.    A proposal will be made of appropriate technology options for different areas based&#13;
on the criteria for choice developed in the management study and on the willingness of the&#13;
population to pay for services.&#13;
(a)    Identification and proposal of feasible technology options to meet sanitation&#13;
needs taking into account institutional, financial, human resource, legal, policy&#13;
and social and cultural considerations and using the criteria developed in the&#13;
management study.&#13;
(b)    Comparison of technological options for collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
taking into consideration the costs of the different alternatives as well as other&#13;
relevant factors and proposing of feasible options for the different parts of the&#13;
Wellington area including assessment of rehabilitation, upgrading and service&#13;
expansion options.&#13;
C.     Financing Options&#13;
14.    Options for financing services will be proposed.&#13;
(a)    Review the mechanisms for financing the different services and identify the&#13;
most suitable cost recovery mechanisms, determine the levels of subsidy&#13;
required, determine the need for credit to individual homeowners and propose&#13;
suitable administrative procedures for loans (such as through commercial&#13;
banks and or revolving funds).&#13;
D.    Institutional Options&#13;
15.    The results of the management study will be the basis for institutional&#13;
recommendations on management of sanitation services in Wellington.&#13;
(a)    Review the options for institutional support and organization (public, private,&#13;
the population) for the different technology choices proposed for the town.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
(b)    Review the existing human resource capacity and propose solutions for&#13;
providing adequate human resources for management and implementation of&#13;
the plan. All training requirements (immediate and future) should also be&#13;
included.&#13;
E.    Implementation Strate,rv&#13;
16.    Preparation of a package of projects and activities (sanitation plan) to be financed by&#13;
the population and Government with the assistance of external financing as appropriate,&#13;
including an implementation schedule and investment plan. An on-going planning process&#13;
will be identified for each service level.&#13;
F.    Sullage Disposal and Drainage&#13;
17.    An analysis of the existing sullage disposal and drainage systems in Wellington will be&#13;
made and recommendations made on improvements required in the management of the&#13;
systems. The recommendations will include: the roles to be played by public and private&#13;
institutions as well as the population being served; description of new or improved systems to&#13;
be constructed and training requirements for artisans and the population; community&#13;
organization, promotion and sensitization activities; financing requirements from government,&#13;
population and external sources.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
18.   Cost recovery for the community-based sanitation component will be achieved in two&#13;
ways, to reflect the share of the cost burden to be borne by the two distinct groups of&#13;
beneficiaries, as follows: (a) Direct cost recovery by applying a nominal charge for the use&#13;
of the facilities, paid by the user. The present rate for existing facilities is Le 20.00 per visit;&#13;
(b) Indirect cost recovery by levying an additional City Council Rate on property owners&#13;
whose premises lie within the catchment area of the facilities, and therefore whose resale and&#13;
rental value will be increased due to their proximity to improved urban services. The rate of&#13;
the direct cost to be levied on the users should be calculated to cover the operation and&#13;
maintenance cost of the facilities, including attendant's salary, cost of cleansing materials and&#13;
an allowance for periodic refurbishment. The quantum of the indirect cost to be added to the&#13;
City Council rate to be levied for the properties within the catchment area should approximate&#13;
to a figure calculated to recover the capital costs, over a reasonable time period.&#13;
Roles of Consultants. Timing and Supervision&#13;
19.   The planning process will take about 12 months, and will begin at the end of the&#13;
management study. Several consultants will be required to assist the team of Government&#13;
officials and NGOs for periods of up to two months each. A sanitation plan will be available&#13;
at the end of the 12 months.&#13;

SIERRA LEONE&#13;
GUMA VALLEY WATER COMPANY&#13;
STUDY ON POSSIBLE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
IN ENHANCING OPERATING EFFICIENCY&#13;
Draft Termns of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) was incorporated in 1961 when the&#13;
Guma Valley water system was completed with financial assistance from the Commonwealth&#13;
Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom. The 1961 Act by Ordinance vested&#13;
in GVWC all necessary rights and authority required to meet the general purposes of the&#13;
company which are:&#13;
*  To procure a supply of water and to distribute it within the limits of supply and&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
*  To supply water in bulk within the limits of supply and elsewhere.&#13;
*  For the above-mentioned purposes, to accept the vesting in it the Guma lands, the&#13;
Guma works and the transferred undertakings and to construct and maintain the&#13;
Guma dam and other works authorized in other sections of the Act.&#13;
2.    GVWC is owned by the Government of Sierra Leone (90%) and the Freetown City&#13;
Council (10%), and controlled by a Board of six members, three appointed by the&#13;
Government, two by CDC and one by the City Council. Its day-to-day management is in the&#13;
hands of a General Manager/Engineer-in-Chief. With a total staff of around 310 including 14&#13;
professional engineers and accountants. GVWC operates its water supply system with an&#13;
installed capacity of 18 Imgd. Most of the water available is being used to serve more than&#13;
600,000 people through some 10,000 (unmetered) connections and 520 standpipes, and 1,600&#13;
commercial/industrial/institutional customers through metered connections.&#13;
3.    GVWC is required to conduct its business on sound commercial principles and to&#13;
generate adequate revenues to meet all its operating expenses, debt service and taxes, make all&#13;
proper provisions and reserves and earn a reasonable return on its capital. It has done a&#13;
commendable job of providing potable water within its jurisdiction under adverse economic&#13;
conditions in the country. Prior to 1981, GVWC fully met its financial obligations. Since&#13;
that time and until a recent agreement with the Government on its capital restructuring, the&#13;
company was unable to meet all its financial obligations although it always maintained positive&#13;
operating incomes. This was largely due to massive devaluations of the Leone during this&#13;
period. And as a result, GVWC's water systems are in need of rehabilitation and expansion.&#13;
4.    A recent IDA credit for the Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP)&#13;
include provision for immediate actions to improve GVWC's water supply operations: a&#13;
concentrated leakage detection and repair program; metering of all domestic connections;&#13;

being served as well as additional standpipes to ensure access to water in the needy areas. At&#13;
the same time, a computerized billing system is being implemented for GVWC to be&#13;
operational in November 1994. Furthermore, studies have been carried out to update&#13;
GVWC's water master plan and review/recommend measures to improve the organization,&#13;
management and finances of the company. These studies formed the basis of the proposed&#13;
Urban Water Supply Project to be financed by IDA. Also, it is expected that the&#13;
responsibility for the sewerage operations in Freetown will be transferred from the&#13;
Department of Energy and Power (DOEP) to GVWC in the next 2-3 years. With a view&#13;
towards further improving the efficiency of its operations, GVWC management desires to&#13;
investigate possibilities for using services of the private sector to perform the function(s) or&#13;
service(s) where appropriate and justified in terms of net savings to the company.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.     Public water utilities in Africa and elsewhere are experiencing many difficulties,&#13;
especially as their operations expand over time. Although GVWC is fairly well-managed at&#13;
the present time, difficulties might arise in the future as its operations expand. The main&#13;
objective of the study is to identify the specific function(s) and service(s) of GVWC which&#13;
could be "privatized" and the possible form(s) of privatization, and to assess the feasibility of&#13;
such possible course of actions.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
6.     The scope of work will include, but not necessarily be limited to:&#13;
*  Review the various functions and services being performed by GVWC staff,&#13;
including billing and collection (for the entire system, individual communities,&#13;
standpipes, etc.), operation and maintenance (of part(s) of the water system, such&#13;
as the Guma dam, Guma water treatment works, transmission and distribution&#13;
networks, etc.), support services (such as stores management, vehicle&#13;
maintenance, data processing services, etc.), etc., as well as those to be performed&#13;
by GVWC with respect to the future take-over of the sewerage operations in&#13;
Freetown.&#13;
*  Identify the specific function(s) and/or service(s) which may be good candidates&#13;
for further consideration and analysis for possible "privatization". Also,&#13;
determine the likely form(s) of privatization for each of these identified functions&#13;
and services.&#13;
*  Assess the availability and capability of the (most likely local) private sector to&#13;
undertake such functions/provide such services and estimated costs.&#13;
*  Assess the financial viability of each of the technically feasible options for&#13;
"privatization" as arrived at through the above steps. Detailed calculations will be&#13;
made on the resulting net cost savings to GVWC, taking into account, among&#13;
other things, the costs (to GVWC) of managing and monitoring the contractual&#13;
arrangements involved.&#13;
&#13;

* Assess GVWC's ability to manage any resulting contracts, and whether any&#13;
strengthening or change in structure might be appropriate for GVWC's&#13;
organization.&#13;
Consultancv Requirement&#13;
7.    It is envisaged that consultants with expertise on privatization of water utility functions&#13;
and knowledge of the Freetown environment will be required for the study for a total of about&#13;
4-5 man-months. The study will be carried out over a period of about 4 months.&#13;
Reporting&#13;
8.    A draft report will be submitted to GVWC for review within 3 months after the start&#13;
of the study. This report will be finalized taking into account the comments of GVWC.&#13;

URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PLAN 1/&#13;
1.    The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been carried out to assess the&#13;
environmental impact of the project which is under Environmental Category B. This report,&#13;
which is being finalized to take account of the Bank's comments among others, is expected to&#13;
be made available by the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) in Sierra Leone at some&#13;
public place accessible to affected groups and local NGOs prior to project appraisal. GVWC&#13;
will officially send it to the Bank to be made available to the Public Information Center (PIC).&#13;
2.     The EIA addresses the environment impact of the following components of the&#13;
proposed Urban Water Supply Project: raising of Guma Dam spillway level; diversion of&#13;
waters from the Little Guma and Upper Sussex catchments into the Guma Dam reservoir; and&#13;
trunk distribution mains from Congo Cross to Dan Street reservoir and from Africanus Road&#13;
reservoir to Wellington reservoir. The environmental impact study involved field survey,&#13;
interviews and discussions with Water Company personnel and local inhabitants by a&#13;
multidisciplinary team of the consultants Hloward Humphreys &amp; Partners Ltd (UK) in&#13;
association with Engcon Ltd. (Sierra Leone). The dam site and sites for the construction of&#13;
weirs, access roads and channels were visited and water samples collected. An analysis of the&#13;
major issues was made taking cognisance of the factors important to environmental&#13;
management and resource use.&#13;
Works to Improve the Yield of Guma Dam&#13;
3.     Guma dam was constructed in the early 1960's and is situated within the Forest&#13;
Reserve of the Western Area of Sierra Leone approximately 13 km due south of Freetown. It&#13;
impounds the Guma River which is one of the rivers forming the upper reaches of No.2&#13;
River. About 90% of the annual average inflow to the reservoir occurs in the four months of&#13;
July to October. The dam is of earth and rockfill construction and is about 70m high. The&#13;
catchment area is 866 ha and the lake area at a top water level of 261m a.s.l (spillway crest&#13;
level) is 93 ha. The dam impounds approximately 21 million cubic meters. During&#13;
construction the forest area upstream of the dam was cleared of vegetation to the 872 ft&#13;
(266m) contour, which is the same level as the top of the dam. The side channel spillway has&#13;
been designed for a flood of 210 m3/s. The present spillway could be raised by up to 1.5m&#13;
and still accommodate the flood without any other work having to be carried out to the dam.&#13;
4.     The yield of Guma dam can be improved by diverting flows from the adjacent&#13;
catchments of the Little Guma, Stoney and Water Chute rivers, which form part of the lower&#13;
Guma/No.2 River catchment. The Upper Sussex catchment of the Sussex river could also be&#13;

&#13;

diverted into the Guma reservoir. In addition, the yield and reliability of Guma can be&#13;
improved by increasing the storage capacity by raising the spillway level of Guma dam.&#13;
5.    The lay-out of the Upper Sussex diversion would comprise a 3m high concrete&#13;
diversion weir at approximately 350m elevation and a trapezoidal unlined channel which&#13;
would intercept run-off from the various subsidiary catchments. The channel would have a&#13;
capacity of about 5m3/s which is three times greater than the estimated peak monthly flow in&#13;
the period 1947 - 1992 of 1.65m3/s. Only a negligible quantity of water will be lost in spills.&#13;
As with Upper Sussex, it is proposed that diversions from Little Guma should be effected by&#13;
means of an open channel. The catchment considered comprise three sub-catchments, with&#13;
approximate areas as follows: Little Guma - 139 ha; Storey river - 47 ha; and Water chute -&#13;
42 ha.&#13;
6.    The findings of the EIA are summarized below:&#13;
7.     Land Loss and Land Degradation. The catchment areas of the Guma dam, Little&#13;
Guma, Stoney, Water Chute and Upper Sussex rivers all form part of the Guma Protected&#13;
Area. The existing catchment for Guma Dam occupies an area of 866 hectares whereas the&#13;
total area of the four additional sub-catchments is 420 hectares (i.e. Little Guma 139 ha,&#13;
Upper Sussex 192 ha, Water Chute 42 ha and Stoney 47 ha). The catchments areas are hilly&#13;
and mountainous and generally unsuitable for agriculture. There is no agricultural or&#13;
economic activity taking place at present either in the catchments or in the areas proposed for&#13;
the diversion weirs, channels and access roads.&#13;
8.    The top water level of the Guma lake is 857 ft (261 m) a.s.l and floods an area of 93&#13;
ha. Raising the top water level by 1.5m will increase the dam capacity to about 23 million&#13;
cubic meters gallons and the flooded area will be increased to 100 ha. At present, the area&#13;
above top water level is almost free of any significant vegetation. This area constitutes a free&#13;
board area of 4.5m in depth. Any increase in storage will be accommodated within this area&#13;
with no need for further vegetation clearing. No significant exposure of land clearing that&#13;
could facilitate land slip, landslide, serious erosion hazards or land degradation was observed&#13;
within the catchment areas or in the areas proposed for the diversion weirs, channels or access&#13;
road. The proposed development areas are devoid of any form of settlement or any form of&#13;
economic activity. The only major land use is the development works done by Guma Valley&#13;
Water Company during the construction of the dam and allied components.&#13;
9.    River Flows. The Guma, Little Guma, Stoney and Water Chute rivers all form part&#13;
of the upper catchment area of the No. 2 River. There are four more major tributaries&#13;
further downstream. Due to impoundment by Guma dam, the Guma catchment contributes&#13;
flow to No. 2 River for no more than three months in the wet season when the dam is&#13;
spilling. The remaining three catchments are estimated to contribute about 0.3m3/s as an&#13;
annual average with virtually no flow from January to May. Those people who depend on&#13;
water from No. 2 River live at the bottom of the catchment. An estimate of discharge at the&#13;
road bridge near the Forestry Compound Settlement at the end of December 1993 was 90&#13;
c.f.s or 2.7m3/s. That part of the Upper Sussex catchment which is likely to feature in any&#13;
catchment transfer is estimated to have also a mean annual flow of about 0.3m3/s. This is&#13;
only a very small portion of the total flow in the Sussex River which like No. 2 River is only&#13;
utilized in its lower reaches. The diversion of water into Guma lake is expected to have little&#13;
effect on the river regime in the lower reaches.&#13;

10.   Fish. Aquatic Life and Water Weeds. The lake and rivers are almost free of any&#13;
algae or water lilies. Mud fish and catfish were observed in the rivers and the Guma lake.&#13;
Tilapia which has been introduced into the Guma lake were also observed. There was a&#13;
complete absence of blackflies and snails along the rivers or the lake.&#13;
11.   Flora and Fauna. The catchment areas are well protected as they lie within the&#13;
declared Government Forest Reserve. The forest reserve falls under the category of Tropical&#13;
Moist Evergreen Forest formed on mountains and hill slopes. Presently, the reserves consists&#13;
of closed high forest, secondary forest and forest regrowth, with relatively high humidity and&#13;
high annual average rainfall of about 250 inches (6350mm) with 3-4 months of dry season.&#13;
The forests serve a wide range of ecological functions including the protection and enrichment&#13;
of the soils and the natural local regulation of the hydrologic cycle especially the flows of&#13;
surface and groundwater.&#13;
12.   Animal species found in these forests are: Jonticks Duicker, Diana Monkey, Red&#13;
Colobus, White-necked Picathartes, Chimpanzee, and a colorful array of insects, bush fowls,&#13;
reptiles, etc. The forests provide a very rich and wide habitat for these animals. The&#13;
diversion of the Little Guma and Upper Sussex rivers would have a minimal effect on plant&#13;
and animal life as less than I % of forest reserve will be affected and also these animals are&#13;
not sedentary but roam wildly in search of food and shelter. Thus the diversion weirs,&#13;
channel and access road which will have a width of less than 16m will not limit the free&#13;
movement of animals nor affect much of the vegetation which is made of forest regrowth,&#13;
shrub and bush. The clearing will, therefore, not adversely affect the closed high forest as&#13;
the species are not endangered along the entire channel/access road route which follows&#13;
approximately the 350m contour. In addition, the very high annual rainfall and average&#13;
yearly temperature would encourage forest emergence to clothe any of the lands which had&#13;
been cleared during construction.&#13;
13.   Health. Observations along the shoreline of the Guma lake and the rivers showed no&#13;
evidence of snails and blackflies which are intermediate hosts for the transmission of&#13;
schistomiasis and Onchocerciasis. From interviews it was established that few mosquitoes are&#13;
present. Guma Valley Water Company workers and inhabitants reported not to have suffered&#13;
from schists or Oncho, but only from malaria. It is quite likely that the few small ponds in&#13;
the vicinity of the Guma compound close to the coastal area serves as breeding grounds for&#13;
mosquitoes.&#13;
14.   Based on the water quality data and analysis of the water sample collected from Little&#13;
Guma River and relevant international standards, it can be concluded that the water quality of&#13;
the rivers to be diverted to the Guma Reservoir will not in any way impair the existing water&#13;
quality of the Guma Reservoir.&#13;
15.   Socio-Economic and Socio-Cultural Factors. Interviews carried out with a cross&#13;
section of the local populace downstream of the dam area with a view of investigating the&#13;
effect/impact of the construction on the local community revealed that:&#13;
(i)    The immediate community have been availed with the supply of pipe-&#13;
borne water supply of good quality and of electricity sometime ago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
Annex 4-7&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
(ii)    The communities downstream have not experienced any serious&#13;
shortage of their normal water supply needs in areas where pipe-borne&#13;
water is not available.&#13;
(iii)   Flooding has never been reported. Never has there been any loss of&#13;
life or property due to any hazard.&#13;
(iv)   No serious erosion, landslides or any form of land degradation has&#13;
been reported.&#13;
(v)    No water-borne disease or serious health hazard have been reported as&#13;
a result of the dam.&#13;
(vi)   Agricultural or economic activities are absent in the Guma Reserve.&#13;
(vii)   Degradation is minimal in the immediate environs of the reserve.&#13;
(viii)  There is limited land use and no settlement in the upper and middle&#13;
catchment areas of the study area.&#13;
(ix)   There is effective restriction entry and regular patrolling of the Guma&#13;
Reserve.&#13;
16.    Conclusions and Recommendations.&#13;
(i)    The construction of access road and channel to conduct flows from&#13;
Little Guma and Upper Sussex catchments to Guma lake will have&#13;
minimal effect on the land, forest and animal resources of the whole&#13;
of No. 2 river catchment area as less than 1 % of the catchment area&#13;
will be disturbed.&#13;
(ii)    By increasing the top water level from 261m to 262.5m a.m.s.l.,&#13;
about 7 ha of additional land surrounding the lake surface will be&#13;
flooded. This will not entail additional forest clearing as these areas&#13;
presently form part of the cleared free board of the lake.&#13;
(iii)   The chemical composition of the rivers to be diverted into the Guma&#13;
lake are very similar to the lake water composition. It is therefore&#13;
expected that these rivers will not affect the aquatic life of the Guma&#13;
lake for both fish and plant species.&#13;
(iv)   No inland fishing is carried out in the Guma lake or along the river&#13;
banks of No. 2 River. Fishing is done only along the coastal creed of&#13;
the river.&#13;
(v)    There are more major tributaries of No. 2 River downstream of Guma&#13;
dam. These contribute water to maintain a reasonable flow in the dry&#13;
season for domestic use and the dilution of water in the mangrove&#13;
ecology along the coast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
Annex 4-7&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(vi)   The Upper Sussex river is not part of the No. 2 River catchment in&#13;
which the Guma Lake is situated. Diverting water from the Upper&#13;
Sussex catchment into the Guma lake will not increase the risk of&#13;
flooding downstream.&#13;
(vii)   Very large flood flows would not be diverted into the Guma. Flow in&#13;
excess of the carrying capacity of the catchwater channel would&#13;
continue down the Sussex river.&#13;
17.    Trunk Distribution Extensions. The proposed project entails the laying of two&#13;
sections of relatively large diameter pipes (500mm to 700mm diameter) through built-up areas&#13;
of the city. The first would be from the termination of an existing DN 700 main on Congo&#13;
Town Main Road to Dan Street reservoir. The length of this main is about 5 km and it will&#13;
pass through the low cost housing and densely populated area of Kroo Bay as well as the busy&#13;
commercial section of the city. Engineering considerations preclude any alternative route.&#13;
The second main, also about 5 km long, would convey water from Africanus Road reservoir&#13;
to Wellington reservoir. This DN 600 main would be laid in or alongside the Kissy By-pass&#13;
road.&#13;
18.    Neither of the two pipelines will have any significant long-term environmental impact.&#13;
Following construction and reinstatement of all surfaces, the only visible evidence of the&#13;
pipelines existence will be valve chambers and short sections of exposed pipe where crossing&#13;
the deeply incised river valleys. Care should be taken when siting pipe fittings to ensure, as&#13;
far as possible, unobtrusive locations for any chambers, the covers of which should be flush&#13;
with the road surface or slightly proud on verges. Exposed pipes should be protected against&#13;
corrosion using bitumen-based paints with colors selected to be unobtrusive and to blend with&#13;
the surrounds.&#13;
19.   Major impacts will occur during the construction stage where the route through&#13;
Freetown's relatively narrow, congested streets will inevitably result in increased noise and&#13;
traffic disruption. Local traffic control regulations should be enforced and every effort made&#13;
to minimize disruption by cooperating with the requirements of the local authorities and the&#13;
traffic police. Access to properties affected by the works should be maintained as far as&#13;
possible by:&#13;
(i)    limiting the amount of trench permitted to be open at any time;&#13;
(ii)   limiting contractor's stringing operations to avoid long lengths of&#13;
unlaid pipes strung by the roadside;&#13;
(iii)   providing financial incentives within the contract for prompt&#13;
temporary reinstatement of trenches;&#13;
(iv)   restricting the dumping of trench spoil in unsuitable or inconvenient&#13;
locations; and&#13;
(v)    ensuring the provision of adequate road plates to enable trench&#13;
crossing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

20.    Dust and noise could become a nuisance but strict control of contractor's activities&#13;
should minimize these effects. However, the anticipated large quantity of rock to be&#13;
encountered will mean that jack hammers, rock breakers and possibly even blasting may be&#13;
required. If so, elaborate measures will need to be taken to safeguard people and property.&#13;
21.    Traffic control will be a major concern. In the central business district, sufficient&#13;
alternative routes exist to minimize congestion; however, in the areas of Congo Town,&#13;
Ascension Town Road, Goderich Road and Kissy Street, significant disruption to traffic must&#13;
be expected. Well-marked alternative routes are required.&#13;
Sewerage System Rehabilitation and Extension&#13;
22.    The extension of the existing sewerage system will have no long term significant&#13;
adverse environmental impacts. Following the construction of the works the only visible&#13;
evidence of the extended system will be the manhole covers on the lower sides of the roads&#13;
carrying the new sewers. These will be flush with the road pavement. New housing&#13;
structures for the screening facilities within walled compounds will replace the existing&#13;
structures although the precise locations have yet to be decided. Major impacts will arise&#13;
from the construction of new sewers in the relatively narrow, heavily congested streets of the&#13;
central city area in terms particularly of increased noise and traffic disruption. Traffic control&#13;
measures will be strictly enforced in cooperation with local authorities and the traffic police.&#13;
Alternative routes will be well marked. Access to private properties and public buildings&#13;
must be maintained by limiting the length of trench permitted to be open at any time, avoiding&#13;
storage of pipes in the streets, ensuring that any discharge from dewatering operations, if&#13;
necessary, is disposed of in an adequate manner, ensuring that trench spoil is not dumped in&#13;
unsuitable locations, that trenches are (temporarily or permanently) reinstated promptly, that&#13;
safety barriers and fencing are used and that road plates are provided for trench crossings.&#13;
Dust and noise will be significant short term impacts but will be mitigated by controlling the&#13;
contractors' activities, dousing dry surfaces and restricting high noise generating activities in&#13;
the late evenings. Screening may be necessary to reduce noise and safeguard the public&#13;
where jack hammers or rock breakers are in use or if blasting is required.&#13;
23.    An important beneficial impact of the extension works will arise from connecting the&#13;
eastern part of the system to the main outfall at Government Wharf. This will eliminate the&#13;
existing outfall in the Naval Base and thus provide improved control over the proposed&#13;
sewage disposal system.&#13;
24.    The preferred form of disposal of sewage effluent for Freetown adopted for the&#13;
project is by means of sea outfalls which discharge offshore and take advantage of the&#13;
assimilative capacity of the deep waters of the estuary to render the wastes harmless through&#13;
dilution, dispersion and oxidation. The construction of plastic pipe sea outfalls to serve the&#13;
immediate requirements of the city will provide significant improvement to the existing&#13;
conditions of the estuary foreshores. Two outfalls will be constructed to discharge the raw&#13;
sewage offshore into a depth of water of between 5m and lOm from the sewerage system in&#13;
the CBD.&#13;

URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
A.    GENERAL&#13;
1.    Financial projections have been carried out for GVWC's water supply operations.&#13;
They have been prepared in current Leones ranging from Le 600/US$ and in 1994 to Le&#13;
868/US$ in year 2000. In addition the domestic annual inflation rates were 17.9% in 1994&#13;
and thereafter constant at 10%.&#13;
B.    INCOME STATEMENTS&#13;
Revenues&#13;
3.    The projections for water sales were based on the consultants' Final Water Supply&#13;
Master Plan Study, which took into consideration the effects of the implementation of&#13;
universal metering effective April 1, 1996 and the implementation of the rehabilitation of&#13;
the water supply expansion and distribution systems under the proposed project. The&#13;
unaccounted-for-water was assumed at these percentages: 45% in 1994,40% in 1995;&#13;
35% in 1996; 33% in 1997; 32% in 1998 and 30% thereafter. These percentages for&#13;
unaccounted for water are in line with the actual results from other parts of Africa.&#13;
Management Fee&#13;
4.    DOEP will enter into an agreement with GVWC by end-July 1994 for the&#13;
management of the sewerage sub-component and procurement of office equipment and&#13;
vehicles and the processing of payments and credit withdrawal applications for the two&#13;
studies for DOEP/WSD and SLWC for a management services fee of 4% based on the&#13;
value of the contract processed during the year.&#13;
5.    Tariffs: The tariffs in the projections have been determined by the future financial&#13;
requirements of the company. However, a new tariff structure will be effective from&#13;
December 1995.&#13;
6.    Expenses: Operating costs (mainly electricity and chemicals) and repairs and&#13;
maintenance (mainly spare parts) are assumed to increase in proportion to the quantity of&#13;
water supplied, and for the domestic element a 10% annual increase has been assumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
Annex 5-8&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Administration expenses (the domestic element) has been increased by 25% for 1994 in&#13;
anticipation of payroll increase and 10%, thereafter; the international inflation has been&#13;
assumed for the imported elements of the above expenses at 5% annually.&#13;
7.    Uncollectables: These are projected as a percentage of revenues; 12% in 1995 and&#13;
10% thereafter.&#13;
8.    Depreciation: Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis at an&#13;
average annual rate of about 4%. This rate reflects the current weighted average&#13;
depreciation rate.&#13;
9.    Income Tax: The current tax regulation stipulates that income tax is 47.25% of&#13;
10% of the gross revenue.&#13;
10.  Interest on borrowings: It has been provided for all the borrowings.&#13;
C.    BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDS FLOW STATEMENT&#13;
11.   Revaluation: Revaluation of fixed assets was completed in 1993/94 as&#13;
covenanted in the FIRP Project and the actual figures are reflected in the 1994 accounts.&#13;
12.  Import Taxes: These have been capitalized in the fixed assets and long term loans&#13;
and will be amortized over the same duration as the loans. The 1995 duties and import&#13;
taxes have been based on actual to date and anticipated disbursements to the end of the&#13;
year.&#13;
13.   Borrowings: The proposed project will be funded by a total of approximately&#13;
$28.2 million from IDA. The IDA credit will be on lent to GVWC over a duration of 20&#13;
years with 5 years grace period at 7.1% interest rate per annum.&#13;
14.   As agreed under the FIRP, GOSL negotiated successfully on behalf of GVWC to&#13;
reschedule the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) debenture loan with a&#13;
current outstanding balance of Le 2.1 billion (£2.6 million) to September 1995, when debt&#13;
service will commence to repay the loan fully over 10 years. The Government also agreed&#13;
to convert the Le 1.2 billion debt forgiven by Caisse Centrale into equity. In return,&#13;
GVWC will service: (a) with effect from July 1, 1993 for a duration of 2 years, the&#13;
remaining ADB loan balance of US$92,727.27 (which GVWC has paid off); and (b) for a&#13;
duration of 5 years at 3.4% interest, the total of Le 301 million net due to GOSL for Le&#13;
108 million net paid to ADB by GOSL (Le 748 million paid to ADB less Le 640 million&#13;
paid into the Public Debt (External) Sinking Fund Account by GVWC) and the total&#13;
arrears of Le 193 million up to June 30, 1993 for the Caisse Centrale loan (Le 6 million)&#13;
and Le 187 million due to the Islamic Development Bank.&#13;

Notes on the Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    The incremental water supply (see table below) as a result of the implementation of the&#13;
leakage detection program under FIRP and the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply&#13;
under the proposed project valued at an average tariff of Le 540 per thousand Ig, which will be&#13;
effective in 1994/95 when the initial benefit of the components begin to accrue and the present&#13;
value benefit of deferring the capital outlay of the Long Term Works (Orugu Dam) as a result of&#13;
implementing the latter projects, will result in an 8% economic rate of return. All costs related to&#13;
the leakage detection program, physical works, engineering designs and construction supervision&#13;
and physical contingencies were included in the analyses and adjusted to exclude duties, taxes.&#13;
The standard conversion factor of 0.93 to adjust the foreign cost of the component was used.&#13;
2.     Sensitivity analyses indicate that with a 10% increase in costs, rate of return would be 8%&#13;
and with a 10% reduction in the volume of water saved, the rate of return would be 7.4%. A&#13;
combination of 10% increase in costs and 10% reduction in the volume of water saved would&#13;
lower the rate of return to 7%.&#13;
3.    The ERR understates the full benefits to arise from the future increase in tariffs as the&#13;
delivery of water services improve with the implementation of the above components. In addition&#13;
the ERR does not take account of the benefits from positive externalities such as improved health&#13;
and productivity as the result of the better availability and quality of water cannot be quantified.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Urban Water
            Supply Project are to: 1) improve water supply and
            sanitation services in Freetown; 2) improve the
            accessibility of these services to the urban poor; and 3)
            ensure that water supply and sanitation services will be
            sustained by strengthening the sectoral institutions.
            Project components include: a) rehabilitation and repair
            work on Guma Dam intake tower and raising of the spillway by
            1.5m to increase storage; b) refurbishment of the Guma Water
            Treatment Plant including replacement of obsolete equipment,
            refurbishment of filters and other modifications to increase
            capacity to match the supply capacity of the Guma reservoir
            and transmission pipelines to Freetown; c) construction of
            new bulk transfer mains to the rapidly growing estern areas
            of Freetown;d) extensions to the distribution system to meet
            the projected 2005 demands; e) improvement of reservoirs,
            and provision of new reservoirs at Governor's Lodge,
            Kortright and Wilberforce Village; f) refurbishment of the
            subsidiary at Kongo, including provision of package
            treatment plant of 1600m/day capacity with the source of raw
            water from the Kongo Reservoir and replacement of the Old
            Gloucester Service Reservoirs; g) secondary distribution
            reinforcement; h) Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC)
            institutional strengthening; i) supply of computers and
            vehicles; j) technical assistance to implement computerized
            systems; k) training of GVWC staff; l) improvement of water
            supply operations in other major towns; m) sanitation
            including technical assistance to plan low cost sanitation
            including the design of a community outreach system
            involving NGOs and/or other private agencies; and n)
            rehabilitation and pilot scale extension of the existing
            sewerage system and extension of the outfalls.
