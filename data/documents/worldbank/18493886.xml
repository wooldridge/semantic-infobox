Attachment 1&#13;
PMR Governance Framework&#13;
Adopted on April 11, 2011&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
PARTNERSHIP FOR MARKET READINESS (PMR)&#13;
PMR Governance Framework&#13;
1.    Objectives of the PMR&#13;
1.1   The PMR aims to provide a platform for technical discussions and the exchange of&#13;
information on market instruments for mitigation, and to help interested countries build&#13;
capacity for scaling up their mitigation efforts through market instruments, and to pilot&#13;
instruments appropriate to their domestic context.&#13;
1.2   The PMR intends to achieve the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   to provide grant financing to countries for building market readiness components;&#13;
(b)   to pilot, test and sequence new concepts for market instruments, both for domestic&#13;
and new international mechanisms, and to identify potential synergies between national&#13;
market based instruments at an early stage;&#13;
(c)   to create a platform  to enable policy makers of government agencies,&#13;
practitioners, and public and private entities to share experiences and information&#13;
regarding elements of market readiness, to learn from one another, promote south-south&#13;
cooperation, and explore and innovate together on new instruments and approaches;&#13;
(d)   to create and disseminate a body of knowledge on market instruments that could&#13;
be tapped for country-specific requirements; and&#13;
(e)   to share lessons learned, including with the UNFCCC.&#13;
2.    Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   Building on the objectives, the PMR will operate in accordance with the following&#13;
principles:&#13;
For the purpose of the PMR, market instruments refer to domestic instruments (e.g., emissions trading scheme)&#13;
and, without prejudging the outcomes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&#13;
(UNFCCC) negotiations, scaled-up market mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
(a)   to be country-led and to build on nationally defined and prioritized mitigation&#13;
policies, according to each implementing country's national circumstances;&#13;
(b)   to coordinate with other readiness efforts to avoid duplication and ensure effective&#13;
use of resources;&#13;
(c)   to cooperate with other actors and processes that are undertaking similar&#13;
initiatives, such as UN agencies and other multilateral development banks; and&#13;
(d)   to promote learning-by-doing through early and integrated efforts.&#13;
3. Activities for Support&#13;
3.1   The activities to be supported by the PMR will be developed on a country-specific basis&#13;
and will build on the country's existing initiatives to meet nationally defined priorities.&#13;
As countries' technical and institutional capacities differ, the PMR resources may be used&#13;
to undertake the activities that serve the objectives of the PMR set out in Section I&#13;
(Objectives of the PMR) above, which may include some or all of the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Assessment - Carrying out a feasibility and capacity assessment for utilizing&#13;
market mechanisms within a portfolio of policy instruments in the context of the&#13;
country's mitigation strategies, including analysis and appraisal of national, sub-national&#13;
and sectoral approaches.&#13;
(b)   Data - Building or enhancing capacity of data collection systems and institutional&#13;
capacity for data reporting and management and for setting up activity reference level.&#13;
(c)   Measurement, Reporting and Veriying (MR V) - Designing or enhancing existing&#13;
MRV frameworks to ensure transparency, quality, credibility and consistency with&#13;
international good practice.&#13;
(d)   Institutional capacity - Carrying out capacity building activities that aim to&#13;
engage with key stakeholders early in the planning process and help the responsible&#13;
government agencies organize cross-agency dialogues and broader consultations.&#13;
(e)   Policy and legal frameworks - Facilitating the design of policy and legal&#13;
frameworks for implementation of market instruments.&#13;
(f)   Piloting and testing - Learning-by-doing is one of the most efficient means to&#13;
gain experience, improve capacity and develop effective instruments. If a country so&#13;
wishes, a pilot program could be set up to test a market instrument selected by the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
