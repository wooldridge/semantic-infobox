   demand, such as multi-village schemes bulk supply or full service provision (bulk and distribution) and water quality treatment.&#13;
 4 Providing analytical evidence to demonstrate economic and social benefits of moving household-based water quality solutions to&#13;
   community-wide water supply systems.&#13;

            Domestic private sector participation : India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In urban areas, piped water supply and
            sanitation are predominantly provided by urban local bodies
            (municipalities) in charge of operations and maintenance (O
            and M). In rural areas, there are about 100,000 water supply
            systems and, in some states, responsibility for service
            provision is being transferred from state water boards and
            district governments to Panchayati Raj institutions at block
            or village level. On the sanitation side, while domestic
            private sector participation (DPSP) is promoted by the
            national government, little attention is given to cost
            recovery and business plan sustainability and there are lack
            of incentives and enforcement for households and industries
            to connect to sewage systems. Water and sanitation program -
            South Asia (WSP-SA) has helped prepare the groundwork for
            PSP in water supply and sanitation in India by advocating
            for performance benchmarking, institutional reform and
            accountability, and promoting access to market financing for
            service providers. It is also helping develop guidelines for
            the Government of India (GoI) on engagement with the private
            sector and documenting models of PSP engagement within the
            country and internationally.
