for&#13;
                                     BIODIVERSITY&#13;
          There are significant actions that can be made by Bank staff as&#13;
      an integral part of their poverty alleviation work which would address&#13;
       the enormous worldwide loss of biodiversityâ&#128;&#148;ecosystems, species, and&#13;
            genes. Some of these actions require â&#128;&#152;walking the extra mileâ&#128;&#153;,&#13;
             but to not do so risks condemning future generations to an&#13;
               impoverished world with fewer development options.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                    Biodiversity Trends&#13;
  Coastal Biodiversity&#13;
  Indicators of habitat lossâ&#128;&#148;disease, invasive species, and coral bleachingâ&#128;&#148;all show declines in&#13;
  biodiversity. Sedimentation and pollution from land are smothering some coastal ecosystems,&#13;
  and trawling is reducing diversity in some areas. Commercial species such as Atlantic cod,&#13;
  five species of tuna, and haddock are threatened globally, along with several species of whales,&#13;
  seals, and sea turtles. Invasive species are frequently reported in enclosed seas, such as the&#13;
  Black Sea, where the introduction of Atlantic comb jellyfish caused the collapse of fisheries.&#13;
&#13;
  Forest Biodiversity&#13;
  Forests, which harbor about two-thirds of the known terrestrial species, have among the&#13;
  highest species diversity and endemism of many ecosystems, as well as the highest number of&#13;
  threatened species. Many forest-dwelling large mammals, half the large primates, and nearly&#13;
  10 percent of all known tree species are at some risk of extinction. Significant pressures on&#13;
  forest species include conversion of forest habitat to other land uses, habitat fragmentation,&#13;
  logging, and competition from invasive species.&#13;
&#13;
  Freshwater Biodiversity&#13;
  The biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems is much more threatened than that of terrestrial&#13;
  ecosystems. More than 10,000 species, or 20 percent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s freshwater fish, have&#13;
  become extinct, threatened, or endangered in recent decades. Physical alteration, habitat loss&#13;
  and degradation, water withdrawal, overexploitation, pollution, and the introduction of non-&#13;
  native species all contribute to declines in freshwater species. Amphibians, fish, and wetland-&#13;
  dependent birds are at high risk in many regions of the world.&#13;
&#13;
  Grassland Biodiversity&#13;
  Natural grasslands across the globe suffer from conversion, overgrazing, simplification, and&#13;
  lower productivity with domino effects to their biodiversity.&#13;
&#13;
  Agrobiodiversity&#13;
  Agricultural land, which supports far less biodiversity than most natural ecosystems, has&#13;
  expanded primarily at the expense of forest areas. As much as 30 percent of the potential area&#13;
  of temperate and subtropical forests has been lost to agriculture through conversion. Intensi-&#13;
  fication also displaces a great diversity of traditional crop varieties with modern high-yield,&#13;
  but genetically-uniform, crops. Nonetheless, certain practices, including fallow periods and&#13;
  shade cropping, can encourage diversity as well as productivity.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
support in the area of biodiversity involves        and biodiversity conservation through&#13;
the establishment and strengthening of              improved management and sustainable use&#13;
protected areas (including activities in buffer     of natural resources in the production land-&#13;
zones), sustainable use of biodiversity outside     scape. All of these activities have important&#13;
protected areas, eradication of alien species,      links to poverty alleviation initiatives. In the&#13;

            Reducing the biological diversity of an
            ecosystem compromises the services it provides and thereby
            diminishes its resilience to disturbance, decreases its
            capacity to respond to change. These are benefits which one
            cannot replace at any reasonable price. Harvesting the
            bounty of ecosystems roots the economies and provides
            employment, particularly in low-and middle income countries.
            From a cultural and ethical perspective, biodiversity feeds
            the souls, providing places for aesthetic enjoyment,
            religious expression, and recreation. There are six main
            challenges which need to be met to better integrate
            biodiversity concerns into mainstream poverty alleviation
            work: (1) the need to care and to recognize the
            responsibility, and the biodiversity links to work and
            people’s futures, and to discuss these with partner
            governments and civil society; (2) the need to move from do
            no harm to do some good for biodiversity; (3) the need to
            work more effectively with client country institutions to
            build local capacity to address the loss of biodiversity -
            as part of a broader effort to strengthen local institutions
            for environmental management and sustainable development;
            (4) the need to explore options for strengthening the
            technical capacity to recognize how sectoral reform and
            investments can help capture biodiversity benefits; what the
            options are for securing additional global benefits with
            concessional funding from the global financing mechanisms;
            and how biodiversity degradation affects economies; (5) the
            need to use funds from the global financing mechanisms more
            strategically to better blend with and catalyze Bank and
            other donor funding; and (6) the need to consider how best
            to assist the clients to participate in, and profit from,
            trade in environmental goods and services especially those
            provided by biodiversity.
