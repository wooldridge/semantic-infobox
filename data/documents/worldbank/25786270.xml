&#13;
ï»¿Interpretative Addendum&#13;
For purposes of interpreting Art. 14.1.4 of the 2014 Framework Agreement (and not as a derogation&#13;
from such Article), - the "notional approach" referred to therein shall apply in the following manner in&#13;
cases of both Direct and Indirect Management modalities:&#13;
a) This Trust Fund is a "Multi Donor Trust Fund" or "MDTF," defined as follows in Article&#13;
1(v) of the 2014 Framework Agreement: "a trust fund that may receive contributions from&#13;
more than one donor, whose funds are pooled under a single set of agreed terms and such&#13;
funds are not earmarked by individual donors for specific categories of expenditures, also&#13;
known as 'joint co-financing' by the Commission." Consequently, the contributions from the&#13;
Commission, as well as from other donors ("Other Contributions"), form an account of&#13;
commingled funds (the "MDTF Pool") within which no one particular donor's contribution&#13;
can be traced.&#13;
b) In administering the MDTF Pool, the Bank applies terms that are the same for all&#13;
contributions to the MDTF, in addition to terms, derived from the 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement, that apply solely to the Commission Contribution ("Commission Terms").&#13;
Examples of Commission Terms include (i) that costs are incurred within a specified time&#13;
period (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(c) and 14.2.1(b)), (ii) that costs are&#13;
verifiable through supporting documents retained for 7-years after the applicable End&#13;
Disbursement Date (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(e), 14.2.1(d) and 17.4), or (iii)&#13;
that the Trust Fund pay for indirect costs only at levels not exceeding those accepted by the&#13;
Commission pursuant to 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 13.4.&#13;
c) The notional approach allows the Commission to participate in MDTFs where not all&#13;
expenditures would be eligible for the Commission (see point b immediately above) without&#13;
earmarking its contribution to specific items or on the basis of geographical criteria. It allows&#13;
so by verifying that there is enough expenditure in the MDTF eligible in accordance with the&#13;
Commission Terms to justify the Commission contribution.&#13;
d) Consequently, if, in carrying out verificaiions or audits of the Trust Fund under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 17.2, a sampling by a European Union competent body finds&#13;
ineligible expenditures because of non-compliance solely with Commission Terms, no refunds&#13;
need be made by the Bank or any Recipients, nor shall adjustments be made under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 15.3.1, nor shall any offsets be applied under 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement Art. 16.5 or otherwise, as long as sufficient Other Contributions to cover the&#13;
amount of such expenditures were made to the MDTF Pool before the End Disbursement&#13;
Date. Such refunds, adjustments or offsets may only be applied (i) if, and to the extent, the&#13;
ineligible expenditures are in excess of Other Contributions and (ii) if the Bank does not&#13;
provide documentation to justify that an amount equal to such ineligible expenditures is&#13;
covered by the Other Contributions.&#13;
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied in conjunction and are consistent with Art. 17 of, and&#13;
Attachment 3 to, the 2014 Framework Agreement, and are also consistent with the terms of Art. 42.2&#13;
of the Rules of Application (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October&#13;
2012).&#13;

Cooperation in International Waters in Africa Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
Governance Structure&#13;
CIWA will be managed by the Water Resources Management Unit (AFTWR) in the World&#13;
Bank. AFTWR is responsible for the administration as well as managing the MDTF including&#13;
fiduciary risks.&#13;
Governance, Administration and Execution. The governance structure is designed to ensure a&#13;
participatory and flexible approach. The governance arrangements will comprise two main structures:&#13;
CIWA Advisory Committee. At least one annual meeting with the Advisory Committee&#13;
("CIWA Advisory Committee" or "Advisory Committee") will be held and if needed, a semi-&#13;
annual meeting will also be considered. The Advisory Committee's role will be to guide&#13;
strategy, review program implementation, and monitor results, periodic meetings of&#13;
consultative groups targeted on specific river-basins might also be considered. The committee&#13;
will comprise all trust fund donors who wish to participate and the World Bank. The World&#13;
Bank will provide an annual progress report as a basis for discussion, drawing out key issues,&#13;
concerns, and action points. Non-MDTF contributing partners may also be invited to&#13;
meetings to broaden dialogue and maintain an inclusive approach. The Committee will be&#13;
both consultative and advisory and will include: (i) provision of a forum for CIWA countries&#13;
and development partners to meet, exchange information, and consult on a regular basis (e.g.&#13;
at least one major meeting a year either in Sub-Saharan Africa or in a donor host country); (ii)&#13;
review and discuss progress reports and implementation of trust fund-financed programs; and&#13;
(iii) review of CIWA funding needs and promotion of the participation of new donors to close&#13;
funding gaps and support new program components. The CIWA Advisory Committee is&#13;
responsible for overseeing the operation of the trust fund. It will provide oversight and ensure&#13;
that the use of its resources meet the objectives of the CIWA program. The CIWA Advisory&#13;
Committee meeting will advise on appropriate action to promote the participation of new&#13;
partners and additional funding to close gaps and support new program components.&#13;
Members of the CIWA Advisory Committee will include a representative of the Bank and a&#13;
representative of each partner contributing to the CIWA MDTF, such as multilateral and&#13;
bilateral institutions, non-governmental organizations and foundations, provided that they had&#13;
signed  an  administrative  agreement/arrangement, or a  series of administrative&#13;
agreements/arrangements, with the Bank for the CIWA MDTF ("the CIWA MDTF&#13;
agreement") with a minimum contribution of USD 500,000.&#13;
* Trust Fund Core Team. A dedicated Trust Fund Core Team will be responsible for the day-&#13;
to-day administration of the MDTF comprising initially a task team leader (TTL) of the&#13;
MDTF and an Operations Analyst appointed by AFTWR. While the Trust Fund Core Team&#13;
will consult the Advisory Committee for strategic guidance and advice, the trust fund&#13;
management decisions will be the responsibility of the World Bank. The Core Team will be&#13;
responsible for: (a) coordinating the allocation of resources to selected activities and projects;&#13;
(b) approval of proposals; (c) providing updates on the implementation progress; (d)&#13;
monitoring outputs and expenditures; (e) quality assurance; (f) overall fiduciary management;&#13;
(g) any other related administrative responsibilities, including issuing the minutes of the&#13;
Advisory Committee meetings; and (h) developing and updating CIWA operational&#13;
guidelines. The guidelines provide procedures for the operation of CIWA and describe the&#13;
objectives and modus operandi of the Trust Fund to provide a common operational platform&#13;
for the CIWA program. The Core Team will assemble a panel for peer review of proposals&#13;
that will provide recommendations to the CIWA Trust Fund Core Team on proposals. The&#13;
core team will be expanded if needed as the CIWA program evolves.&#13;
