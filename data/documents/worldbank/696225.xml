THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM&#13;
RURAL TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RURAL POVERTY&#13;
1.1   Although Vietnam has undergone a period of successful macroeconomic reform, its&#13;
overall economic indicators still show a high incidence of poverty. Since the late 1980s the&#13;
country has gone through a series of structural reforms and adjustments to external shocks&#13;
occasioned by the collapse of the Soviet Union. The economic reform program led to signs&#13;
of economic recovery and to rapid economic growth averaging more than 8 percent a year&#13;
by 1992. Growth may increase to 9 percent a year for the rest of the decade. This&#13;
continued economic growth is contributing to the reduction of poverty. However,&#13;
according to IDA analyses, the country's poverty rate remains high, at a rate of 50 percent,&#13;
although this rate is less than the 80 percent rate of a decade ago.&#13;
1.2   Vietnam has a population of 72 million people and a per capita GDP of US$250,&#13;
with marked differences in living standards between urban and rural areas. The Vietnam&#13;
Poverty Assessment and Strategy Report (Report No. 13442-VN) estimates that 26 percent&#13;
of the urban population falls below the poverty line, whereas 57 percent of the rural&#13;
population is below the minimum subsistence level. Moreover, urban areas are growing&#13;
more quickly than rural areas, and thus poverty reduction will occur there more quickly. In&#13;
addition to urban-rural differences, there are regional differences in Vietnam's poverty&#13;
profile. In the southeast 33 percent of the population is in poverty, whereas the rate in the&#13;
north central coast is 71 percent and in the northern uplands, 59 percent. Exacerbating the&#13;
poverty problem, the poorest regions of the country have particularly low growth rates. So&#13;
prospects for significant poverty reduction - without additional efforts - appear slim.&#13;
Although some parts of Vietnam may be difficult to develop economically, many other areas&#13;
could be highly productive if they received appropriate investments to encourage more&#13;
dynamic participation in the market economy.&#13;
B. TEE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY&#13;
ALLEVIATION&#13;
1.3   Analysis of the 1995 Vietnam Living Standards Survey offers useful insights into the&#13;
development of Vietnam's rural development strategy. First, areas where households are&#13;
more economically diversified have higher living standards. Second, areas with higher&#13;
agricultural productivity are more diversified. These findings are consistent with the&#13;
experience of other East Asian countries - that is, higher agricultural productivity leads to&#13;
higher farm income, stimulates demand for off-farm goods and services, and leads to greater&#13;
off-farm employment opportunities. With an average of 900 people on each square&#13;
kilometer of agricultural land, the long-term solution for rural employment will have to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
off the farm. The Living Standards Survey also indicates that people who live near an all-&#13;
weather road have higher living standards than others. Rural roads facilitate access to&#13;
better agricultural technology, more efficient marketing of agricultural surplus, and greater&#13;
opportunity in other economic activities.&#13;
1.4   As a result of the poverty assessment report and the Living Standards Survey, the&#13;
Govemment has placed development of rural areas at the forefront of its poverty alleviation&#13;
effort, with particular emphasis on areas of solid growth potential within the poorest&#13;
regions. One of the important initiatives to start the campaign for rural development is the&#13;
provision of economic infrastructure, including rural transport infrastructure. Therefore,&#13;
rehabilitation of the wide network of rural roads that exists throughout Vietnam - and that&#13;
over decades of war and economic hardship has deteriorated badly - has recently become&#13;
one of the Government's investment priorities.&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.5   Because poor rural transport conditions are impeding rural development, the&#13;
Government has requested Bank's assistance (through the Intemational Development&#13;
Association, or IDA) on a rural transport development program. This request is consistent&#13;
with the Vietnam Poverty Assessment Strategy Report and with IDA's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam discussed at the Board on November 21, 1995. The goal set&#13;
forth in the CAS is to promote broadly based economic development and to combat&#13;
poverty. Two of five areas of involvement strategy are to take the lead among donors in&#13;
assisting the Govermment to plan and finance infrastructure development and to develop and&#13;
implement a strategy for poverty alleviation.&#13;
1.6   IDA has a two-pronged approach to road development and upgrading in Vietnam.&#13;
Nationally the priority for the country, IDA, the Asian Development Bank, and other&#13;
bilateral donors is to rehabilitate the main trunk road network from China in the north to&#13;
Cambodia in the south. The IDA-assisted Highway Rehabilitation Project (US$168 million)&#13;
has been part of that joint effort. At the rural level the ultimate target of IDA assistance is&#13;
to upgrade the core rural road network to all-weather roads.&#13;
1.7   The proposed Rural Transport Project contributes directly to infrastructure&#13;
development and to the country's effort in rural development and poverty alleviation. The&#13;
poverty-focused tasks included in the project are designed to ensure that the poor&#13;
participate in the growth process. IDA's support to rural development in Vietnam will&#13;
stand on four pillars that together provide the overall enabling environment for the rural&#13;
economy: infrastructure, finance, technical support to agricultural diversification, and&#13;
human resource development. The Rural Transport Project will focus primarily on road&#13;
rehabilitation in some of the poorest parts of the country (see attached map). Because more&#13;
than three-quarters of the poor (76 percent) in Vietnam are concentrated among the farming&#13;
population, antipoverty interventions must give high priority to reaching agricultural&#13;
households to achieve any significant impact. The poverty assessment report confirms that&#13;
lack of rural infrastructure and inadequate access to markets and other essential support&#13;
services are among the crucial factors contributing to the persistent poverty and widespread&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
malnutrition in rural Vietnam. The strategy for reducing poverty, therefore, includes rural&#13;
infrastructure investment that will benefit the rural economy through improved access and&#13;
lower transport cost; the proposed project is designed to do just that. These investments&#13;
will be complemented by those in the education and health sectors as well as projects in&#13;
rural finance and agricultural diversification, which are essential for improving the efficiency&#13;
of rural labor and the welfare of Vietnamese families.&#13;
D. PAST ]]DA EXPERIENCE IN VIETNAM&#13;
1.8   So far, only one IDA-assisted project has been completed in Vietnam, the Dau&#13;
Tieng Irrigation Project (Cr. 845-VN), which was approved in August 1978 and closed in&#13;
1986. The Dau Tieng Irrigation Project Completion Report emphasized that a project's&#13;
major works should be adequately designed prior to project implementation and that&#13;
external technical assistance in procurement and construction supervision is essential to&#13;
overcome problems of inexperience with international procedures faced by a new borrower.&#13;
Other lessons highlighted by IDA's experience in rural roads are indicated in Rural Roads&#13;
Maintenance - Review of Completed IDA Operations (Report 10794). According to the&#13;
report, routine and periodic maintenance should be an integral part of project components,&#13;
including physical definitions, cost, financing plan, procurement, and disbursement, and that&#13;
monitoring, evaluation, and reporting procedures should be upgraded.&#13;
1.9   Two other agriculture sector credits were approved in 1994-95, the Agriculture&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 2561-VN) and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2711-&#13;
VN). These two projects are in the early stages of implementation. Early lessons from these&#13;
projects indicate a problem in the flow of funds among the different government agencies,&#13;
and between the provincial and central governments.&#13;
1.10  The first IDA-financed road project in Vietnam, the Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(Credit 2549-VN) became effective in June 1994, and experienced initial problems in&#13;
implementation of the agreed Resettlement Action Plan. These problems can be attributed&#13;
to the lack of experience in dealing with IDA and to the difficulty in applying a new&#13;
standard of compensation for resettlement. There were also budgetary concerns about the&#13;
cost of resettlement. However, the establishment of a Project Management Unit and the&#13;
appointment of international consultants to help train staff and provide technical advice&#13;
through the initial phase have been helpful.&#13;
1.11  The proposed project would be the first IDA operation to support rural&#13;
infrastructure in Vietnam. Therefore, the above lessons were incorporated in the project&#13;
design by:&#13;
(a)    developing technical design as well as procurement procedures and tender&#13;
documentation ahead of project approval;&#13;
(b)    providing for adequate technical assistance to support project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(c)    setting up a framework to develop an effective maintenance system under&#13;
the project to ensure that the investment under the project is properly and&#13;
sustainably maintained after the project is completed;&#13;
(d)    discussing with the Government early on the policy framework for&#13;
compensation to be applied to any resettlement and land acquisition under&#13;
the project, and obtaining Government approval before the project&#13;
becomes effective; and&#13;
(e)    ensuring that a computerized monitoring and evaluation system will be&#13;
developed at an early stage of project implementation and that models of&#13;
reports are included in the Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RURAL TRANSPORT&#13;
SECTOR IN VIETNAM&#13;
2.1   Inadequate economic infrastructure has been identified as one of the main elements&#13;
in the persistence of rural poverty because it hinders opportunities to seek additional off-&#13;
farm income and greater participation in the market economy. Rural Vietnamese have less&#13;
access to infrastructure than the rural inhabitants of neighboring countries, and fewer than&#13;
one-third of Vietnam's rural population has access to all three key types of facilities:&#13;
passable roads, public transport, and permanent markets.&#13;
2.2   In the past, central government budgets for transport covered only national and&#13;
provincial transport networks, with an insignificant amount allocated to district and&#13;
communal networks. Because of the limited budgets of most local governments, their self-&#13;
help efforts to rehabilitate their local infrastructure are done on a piecemeal basis. The&#13;
results are often of low quality and therefore short-lived. However, with the Government's&#13;
recent focus on rural development, it has set an ambitious target to connect six isolated&#13;
districts and at least 400 isolated communes by 2000. The Government also plans a large-&#13;
scale rehabilitation program to upgrade the existing rural networks to nearly all-weather&#13;
roads. The plan calls for substantial allocations from the central budget, or about US$60&#13;
million a year, earmarked for rural transport development. This amount is still relatively&#13;
small compared with the actual needs for rehabilitation and extension of the rural transport&#13;
network. The resources from IDA through the proposed project will provide timely&#13;
assistance to the Government in its endeavor.&#13;
A. THE ROAD NETWORK&#13;
2.3   Vietnam's more than 105,000 kilometers of classified roads are defined as national,&#13;
provincial, district, or communal roads. This network compares favorably with neighboring&#13;
countries, although its condition is poorer with respect to surface condition, width, water&#13;
crossing structures, and drainage system. Of the 105,000 kilometers, only 11,350 (11&#13;
percent) are national roads. Of the remainder, 14,000 kilometers (13 percent) are provincial&#13;
roads and the rest (76 percent) are rural roads (district and communal roads). Most rural&#13;
roads are in poor condition: drainage is inadequate, bridges are missing or in poor&#13;
condition, and shoulders are not stable. This is confirmed by the fact that about 30 percent&#13;
of the country's 25,000 kilometers of district roads and more than 50 percent of its 46,000&#13;
kilometers of communal roads are inaccessible during the wet season.&#13;
2.4   Road networks classified by jurisdiction and pavement type are shown in Table 2.1.&#13;
Only 60 percent of national roads and 18 percent of provincial roads are paved; most&#13;
district roads have earth or natural gravel surfaces. District roads, as defined by the&#13;
Ministry of Transport (MOT), link district towns to provincial centers; the majority are in&#13;
poor condition and most are inaccessible in the rainy season. Communal roads are classified&#13;
as intercommunal roads, linking communal centers to district roads or to other communes;&#13;
intervillage roads, linking villages within the same commune; and village roads, which are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
located within village boundaries. These communal roads are for the most part built to low&#13;
or no technical standards.&#13;

Total                   105,557          12,935         87,171&#13;
2.5   The Government has established general and detailed standards for the various&#13;
classes of roads. Standard specifications for district roads are 6 meters in width with a 3.5-&#13;
4.0 meter carriageway and, for communal roads, 4 to 5 meters in width with a 2.5-3.0 meter&#13;
carriageway. Other design standards relating to gradients, radius of curves, and other&#13;
features are in line with international practice and, therefore, major revisions to Vietnam's&#13;
road standards are not necessary.&#13;
2.6   However, the same cannot be said for structural standards and techniques. In the&#13;
north, road pavements consisting of a 30-50 centimeter depth of pitched large stones&#13;
topped with a 10-12 centimeter layer of penetration asphalt macadam are somewhat&#13;
overdesigned. In the south, pavements are more commonly built of natural and lathyritic&#13;
gravel. Based on international experience, many roads with light traffic in rural areas could&#13;
be more economically built with gravel pavements of 15-20 centimeter depths. The&#13;
introduction of modern knowledge and technologies in this area would be useful.&#13;
2.7   Current standards for bridges in rural areas also need review and revision. Existing&#13;
design standard for bridges are 6-ton axle loads for district roads and 2.5-ton axle loads for&#13;
commune roads. Such structures are not adequate for modern trucks designed to carry&#13;
loads of 8 tons per axle. Also, bridges built to existing light-load standards would not&#13;
support the loads imposed by compactors and other heavy road machinery. Therefore, the&#13;
axle load standards for bridges to be constructed under the project should be revised&#13;
upward.&#13;
2.8   There is no reliable road inventory of the district and communal road networks.&#13;
However, the detailed maps of the fifteen provinces selected, which were prepared by their&#13;
respective Provincial Departments of Transport (PDOT) during project preparation, show a&#13;
combined length of 33,100 kilometers of classified roads, of which 4,000 kilometers (12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
percent) are part of the national network, 5,100 kilometers (15 percent) are provincial&#13;
roads, 11,000 kilometers (33 percent) are district feeder roads, and 13,000 kilometers (40&#13;
percent) are communal access roads passable by four-wheel drive vehicles and homemade&#13;
trucks. In addition, approximately 13,000 kilometers of tracks, trails, and paths serve&#13;
communal and village travel and transport needs. The district roads and communal roads in&#13;
the project area represent about 36 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of the country's&#13;
total networks in those respective categories.&#13;
B. RURAL TRAFFIC&#13;
2.9    Transport in rural areas includes land and water transport. Land transport services&#13;
use small to medium-sized trucks, cars, buses, bicycles, motorcycles, and animal-drawn&#13;
carts in addition to walking with small loads. Water transport services use mainly small&#13;
boats. Land and water transport complement each other very well and the interchange of&#13;
traffic between them would be greatly facilitated by the construction of small landing stages&#13;
or piers at strategic locations.&#13;
2.10  Bicycles are used to transport rice paddy along paths on the dikes between the fields&#13;
and then along the roads to villages or homes. Bicycles are modified for the purpose by&#13;
adding platforms on each side. Loads of 150 kilograms or more are common on these&#13;
bicycles. Pedestrian traffic also forms a significant part of traffic movement in rural areas;&#13;
pedestrians use shoulder poles with carriers or panniers on each end to transport a wide&#13;
variety of freight and food products. Animal-drawn carts are also common; many of them&#13;
use solid rubber tires or bandages that are damaging to road pavements. Motorcycle use is&#13;
growing rapidly to replace other smaller vehicles.&#13;
2.11   The country's motorized vehicle fleet of 180,000 units, mainly trucks and buses&#13;
(1992), is small but growing rapidly and is expected to increase sharply in the coming years.&#13;
There are no statistics about how much of this fleet uses rural roads but, based on field&#13;
observations, only a small portion of the motor vehicle fleet operates or provides services&#13;
on district or communal roads. The most common commercial freight transport is by&#13;
homemade trucks, Cong Nong, which are assembled in several provinces by small&#13;
enterprises. The engines are manufactured in government factories and other parts are&#13;
made locally. Truck capacity is about one ton, or up to one cubic meter of goods. Their&#13;
price, approximately US$1,300-1,500, is affordable to some rural inhabitants. Medium-&#13;
sized trucks are used mainly to transport freight between district and provincial capitals.&#13;
2.12  Traffic in rural areas, although not very high in volume, is chaotic because of the&#13;
lack of traffic discipline and the failure to observe road rules and courtesy. This problem is&#13;
compounded by nontraffic road uses. Roads, for example, can be the only relatively drained&#13;
and flat area available for drying crops or laundry, and they are used for temporary storage&#13;
of items awaiting pickup. Accordingly, improvements to road conditions and quality would&#13;
not necessarily translate into faster and less costly travel without improved traffic behavior&#13;
and universal observation of the rules of the road.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS&#13;
RELATIONSHIP WITH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT&#13;
2.13  The 1992 Constitution of Vietnam provides for a unitary system of Government. At&#13;
the highest level is the National Assembly, which meets twice a year and has a Standing&#13;
Committee that acts on the Assembly's behalf in the interim period. The Assembly decides&#13;
major economic policies and approves the national plan and state budget as well as major&#13;
investment projects after they have been reviewed by the Office of Government. The&#13;
National Assembly elects the prime minister, who is also head of the Office of Government.&#13;
The Ministry of Planning and Investment prepares and submits to the Office of Government&#13;
for approval investment plans and large project proposals based on input from sector&#13;
ministries and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).&#13;
2.14  At the provincial level, provincial administration is subdivided into districts and&#13;
municipalities. The political entities are the People's Councils at the provincial, district, and&#13;
municipal (commune) levels. Each People's Council has a Standing People's Committee to&#13;
act on its behalf between meetings. The People's Council elects a chairman to be the head of&#13;
the People's Committee and forms the provincial government.&#13;
2.15  The administrative system is centralized. Provincial governments are considered&#13;
part of the central government and are fully committed to implementing any policy issued by&#13;
the central government. Financial allocation is also centralized. The People's Committee in&#13;
each province prepares a provincial budget and investment plan for its province and submits&#13;
them to the Government Office who will consolidate the state budget and obtain approval&#13;
from the National Assembly. The approved plan is passed on to the MOF for budget&#13;
allocation. Provincial expenditures are financed from two sources: internal revenue levies in&#13;
the province and MOF funds to cover any shortfall. Only a few provinces have surplus&#13;
revenue over expenditures. In such cases the surplus is remitted to the MOF for&#13;
reallocation.&#13;
2.16  For the transport sector, each province has a Provincial Department of Transport&#13;
(PDOT) that reports directly to the provincial government and acts as the administrative&#13;
arm of the provincial government for planning, budgeting, and financing of the transport&#13;
sector in the province. However, the PDOT also have to conform to the professional,&#13;
technical, and general transport policy guidance issued by the MOT.&#13;
2.17  The division of responsibilities between the MOT and the provincial departments is&#13;
clear. The ministry is responsible for all capital investment works on national roads system,&#13;
from construction and rehabilitation to operations. However, routine maintenance is done&#13;
by provincial departments for sections of national roads that fall in their provincial&#13;
boundaries. The ministry is responsible for developing technical standards, approving the&#13;
country's overall transport plans, and implementing them through state-owned enterprises&#13;
and private sector contractors. The ministry also has a small rural road unit responsible&#13;
mainly for distributing rural road development budgets to the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.18  Division of responsibilities between provincial and district offices regarding&#13;
maintenance of roads is not clearly defined and varies from one province to another. In&#13;
most of the provinces, the PDOT are responsible for part of the national network, all of the&#13;
provincial network and some of the district roads in their jurisdictions. Most district roads&#13;
and all of the communal roads are the responsibility of district offices through their&#13;
transport divisions, usually consisting of one to three engineers and technicians.&#13;
D. RURAL ROAD MAINTENANCE&#13;
2.19  The funding available for road maintenance in rural areas is insufficient to meet&#13;
growing demand. The MOT allocated an equivalent of US$5 million in 1994 for rural roads&#13;
construction and maintenance. However, very little of this money went to maintenance;&#13;
almost all of it went to new road construction. Rehabilitation and routine maintenance of&#13;
big structures, such as bridges, are done by provincial departments, mostly through their&#13;
own enterprises. On the other hand, maintenance of small structures as well as surface&#13;
work on district roads is coordinated by district offices. Maintenance parties are organized&#13;
in teams (on an ad hoc basis) consisting of three to five people responsible for a road&#13;
segment, corresponding to about 1 kilometer per person. Because of funding shortages,&#13;
most maintenance work is focused on areas where local materials and unskilled labor are&#13;
easily available and ignores those works that require skilled labor and imported material.&#13;
This explains why resurfacing work is usually washed away because of the lack of drainage&#13;
system structures, and also explains why large numbers of bridges are missing.&#13;
2.20  There are no standards or specifications for periodic and routine maintenance of&#13;
rural roads. In addition, there is no annual plan for maintenance, nor does coordination&#13;
exist among the different government agencies to undertake the work. The lack of a rural&#13;
roads inventory indicates the scope of the problem, and adds to the problems of&#13;
maintenance management. The shortage of funds is aggravated by the lack of an effective&#13;
system for routine maintenance. As a result rural roads continue to be of low quality and&#13;
short-lived, and inaccessible during the rainy season because the excess rain washes away&#13;
the new earth layer. The project will provide assistance in strengthening the standard&#13;
practice of routine maintenance in the project provinces (paras. 3.16-3.17).&#13;
2.21  In Vietnam, men between 18 and 50 years of age and women between 18 and 45&#13;
are required to provide ten workdays per year of unpaid service to the Government. These&#13;
days are used most commonly to undertake new construction and routine maintenance of&#13;
public facilities, including roads. Because resurfacing work requires limited skills, the&#13;
government uses the ten days for new construction and maintenance of roads by providing&#13;
material and some technical assistance. If the work requires more than ten working days,&#13;
the government may keep the workers beyond this period and pay them an equivalent of 3.0&#13;
to 3.5 kilograms of rice for each extra day of work.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
3.1   Rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance needs were first identified during the&#13;
December 1994 programming mission held in Hanoi between IDA and the Govermment of&#13;
Vietnam. During the mission a first project to develop an effective rural transport network&#13;
in rural and less privileged areas was agreed upon. The Govemment has made the project a&#13;
priority because rural transport development was identified in a poverty assessment study as&#13;
a key element to speed up the poverty alleviation program in rural areas.&#13;
3.2   The MOT was assigned as the counterpart agency responsible for preparing the&#13;
project jointly with IDA. During the one-year period for project preparation, the ministry&#13;
assigned five full-time staff to set up a Project Preparation Team in its Project Management&#13;
Unit 18 to work with IDA and consultants hired under grant funding.&#13;
3.3   The Government also selected 15 provinces to benefit from the project. The&#13;
selection was based on poverty criteria developed with IDA. Three of the five provinces&#13;
selected in the northem upland, two of the three in north central, and two in the central&#13;
highland are among the poorest provinces in the country. Two of the four provinces in the&#13;
flood-prone area of the Mekong Delta and one coastal province are among the country's&#13;
very poor provinces. The provinces selected represent the country's three distinctive&#13;
terrains. Their combined population of 20 million people, 131,000 square kilometers of&#13;
land, and 37,000 kilometers of the rural transport network represent 27 percent of the&#13;
country's population, 39 percent of land area, and 30 percent of the rural road network.&#13;
3.4   Transfers from the central government have been essential to the economies of these&#13;
provinces. The proportion of the budget transfer to total revenue of the provinces varies&#13;
from 31 percent for Minh Hai, a moderately poor province, to more than 80 percent for Ha&#13;
Giang, one of the country's poorest provinces. However, the share of investment in&#13;
transport to total provincial expenditures has been minimal in the selected provinces-&#13;
between 2 and 5 percent. Most transport investment has gone for capital improvements&#13;
and maintenance of provincial roads. The maintenance budget is insignificant (less than 1&#13;
percent) in many cases (Annex 1). The proposed project will, for the first time, enable the&#13;
selected provinces to tackle their rural infrastructure needs in a more systematic manner.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives and Monitoring Indicators&#13;
3.5   Project Objectives. In line with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (paras. 1.5-&#13;
1.7) and the concern voiced by local governments during the joint Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Investment/UNDP/IDA poverty workshop in September 1995, the overall objectives of the&#13;
project are to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(a)    improve and upgrade access to rural communities and link them to the&#13;
district and provincial road networks;&#13;
(b)    develop local capacity to improve the level of service of low-volume roads&#13;
and to maintain them on a sustainable basis; and&#13;
(c)    encourage the development of local contractors.&#13;
3.6   Key Monitoring Indicators. The project's achievement will be measured against&#13;
the following key indicators agreed to by the Government and IDA (see para. 4.14) and&#13;
summarized in Annex 2:&#13;
(a)    Input indicators, upon which project implementation progress will heavily&#13;
depend, include the recruitment of an international-level technical adviser;&#13;
the number of workshops and amount of training organized for the Project&#13;
Implementation Division (PID), Provincial Project Management Units&#13;
(PPMUs), and contractors; and the speed in procuring necessary&#13;
maintenance equipment for the project.&#13;
(b)    Output and outcome indicators, which are related to physical targets,&#13;
include the length of rehabilitated roads, the length of maintained roads,&#13;
and the improvement in road accessibility during the rainy season.&#13;
(c)    Development impact indicators, which indicate the social and development&#13;
benefit derived from road rehabilitation, include the increase in household&#13;
income from off-farm work, the increase in number of trips to economic&#13;
and social infrastructures, and the increase in the size of contracts&#13;
undertaken by small contractors.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.7   To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project will help finance the&#13;
following main components:&#13;
(a)    rural access road rehabilitation and maintenance using the spot&#13;
improvement technique;&#13;
(b)    institutional strengthening and training; and&#13;
(c)    the study of issues relating to rural transport development.&#13;
3.8   Rural Access Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The specific features&#13;
included in this component are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(a)    rehabilitation and improvement of about 5, 000 kilometers of roads and&#13;
bridges in the 15 selected provinces, of which 3,500 kilometers (70&#13;
percent) will be district roads and 1,500 kilometers (30 percent) will be&#13;
communal roads;&#13;
(b)    development of an effective road maintenance procedure and practice by&#13;
assisting in setting up a maintenance management program; and&#13;
(c)    resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by the project.&#13;
3.9   During project preparation the Project Preparation Team and PDOT, with assistance&#13;
from consultants, prepared the detailed rural core network maps, which demonstrates that,&#13;
on average, 40 percent of rural road networks transverse areas where average population&#13;
density per square kilometer is more than 300, and that about 70 percent of the population&#13;
in the road service area will benefit directly or indirectly from these roads. Although&#13;
improvement of all the core rural network identified on the map is well beyond the&#13;
resources available under the project, the maps provide a good basis for selection of roads&#13;
to be included in the first-year program. Preliminary road inventories and engineering of&#13;
1,200 kilometers of roads carried out during project preparation in four provinces indicate&#13;
that the per kilometer costs will vary between US$4,000 and US$20,000, with an average&#13;
of US$7,000 - US$10,000. This estimate includes the cost of preparing project engineering&#13;
designs through the application of simplified methods and procedures prepared for this&#13;
purpose and included in the Technical Guidelines annexed to the Operational Manual. The&#13;
engineering work will be contracted to local survey and design companies at the provincial&#13;
level, with price limits of US$100 per kilometer of road, including field and office works.&#13;
3.10 Level of Service Aims Under the Project. The level and type of improved access&#13;
will be tailored to the specific needs of people in different areas. Two levels of access are&#13;
aimed for under the project: (a) reliable access, which provides relatively consistent and&#13;
safe access with some short-term closures permissible; and (b) minimum access, which&#13;
provides basic and essential access to local populations although with some difficulty and&#13;
sometimes with longer closures than with reliable access. The technical standards and&#13;
design features will be kept simple and low cost, although they will be completely adequate&#13;
for the required performance from an engineering perspective.&#13;
3.11   Communal roads will be improved to a stage where they can provide minimum&#13;
access (para. 3.10). For these roads, which serve the immediate day-to-day travel and&#13;
transport needs of villages and communes, the approach to be adopted will be a&#13;
participatory one, starting from the initial planning and decisions on the selection of roads to&#13;
be improved, the type of improvements to be carried out and their simple engineering&#13;
features, and the methods and resources to be used for the work. These approaches will be&#13;
worked out during the first year of the project on a pilot basis, and will be implemented in&#13;
future years. The continued participation of beneficiary communities in future maintenance&#13;
of these roads will be addressed during the first-year program (see para. 4.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.12  Spot Improvement Method. Based on the levels of access aimed for under the&#13;
project, such access can be economically achieved using a spot improvement method to&#13;
bring the roads to a maintainable condition and to maintain them routinely. Spot&#13;
improvements will be carried out without any significant changes to vertical and horizontal&#13;
alignment. Spot improvement includes reshaping of running surfaces to improve surface&#13;
drainage and traffic running conditions; drainage works such as lateral, cross, and&#13;
longitudinal drains; erosion control and elimination of landslides; and limited graveling,&#13;
mostly with natural gravel or some macadam and irregular stone paving on steep grades.&#13;
Although the works will be limited to improvements at critical spots, they will be of good&#13;
quality, appropriate for present and short-term projected traffic, and consistent with current&#13;
Vietnamese standards (TCN 4054-85 for district roads and 22-TCN-210-92 for commune&#13;
roads Class A and B). The current geometric standards are in line with international&#13;
standards. However, structural design and techniques are usually overdesigned considering&#13;
the existing light traffic volume on rural roads (see paras. 2.5-2.6).&#13;
3.13  The Government, with assistance from IDA and consultants, has prepared an&#13;
Operational Manual (OM) to be used under the project. The manual includes selection&#13;
criteria for roads and bridges to be included under the project, a sample bid document, an&#13;
illustrative flow of funds, and technical guidelines. Prior to negotiations, the draft OM was&#13;
reviewed and found satisfactory to IDA. At negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
MOT will adopt and implement the OM, that the OM will be reviewed in light of&#13;
implementation experience, and that any revision of the OM will be furnished to IDA for&#13;
approval (see also para. 4.6)&#13;
3.14  The Selection Criteria. The roads and bridges to be included in the project will be&#13;
selected based on the following population, economic, and social criteria:&#13;
(a)    Population Criteria. The selection of roads for rehabilitation aims to&#13;
maximize the number of beneficiaries while maintaining network continuity&#13;
and consistency as well as paying attention to logistical constraints and&#13;
pragmatic work scheduling. The selection criteria, therefore, include&#13;
screening of candidate road sections based on the number of people served.&#13;
The selection criteria will be fine-tuned in later years after gaining&#13;
experience in the first year. Also, in the later years, the selection criterion&#13;
based on population density will be made more stringent to ensure that the&#13;
maximum number of people is served for each kilometer of road improved.&#13;
At this stage the tentative criteria set is that each kilometer of road will&#13;
serve a minimum of 300 people. Roads in provincial capitals and towns will&#13;
not be eligible for improvement under this project.&#13;
(b)    Economic Criteria. An economic analysis (Chapter 5) shows that with an&#13;
average yield per hectare of 3.5 tons for paddy, a majority of farm&#13;
production in Vietnam, at a price of VND 2,000 per kilogram, it will&#13;
generate sufficient value-added benefit to support a road improvement cost&#13;
of US$15,000 per kilometer. The economic criteria, therefore, include a&#13;
set of parameters in that: on the cost side the average investment cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
should not exceed US$15,000 per kilometer; on the benefit side, that at&#13;
least one-third of the road services area is productive land. However, if the&#13;
investment cost increases to US$20,000 per kilometer, the investment will&#13;
be justified only if the road services an area in which a higher-value crop is&#13;
produced on a commercial scale. Cost-benefit analysis will be required to&#13;
justify the investment in such cases (para. 5.6).&#13;
(c)    Social Criteria. Although poverty alleviation is one of the project's main&#13;
objectives, the above population and economic criteria may leave some of&#13;
the poorest segments of the rural society outside the project's reach. To&#13;
target less-privileged mountain and ethnic populations in areas where&#13;
population density is low and economic potential dim, 20 percent of the&#13;
road rehabilitation fund will be earmarked for rural access in those areas&#13;
not justified under the population and economic criteria. The social&#13;
criterion to be used in these areas is that more than 30 percent of the road-&#13;
influenced area is populated by an ethnic minority.&#13;
3.15  Selection of Bridges. The bridges to be rehabilitated under the project will be&#13;
selected based on the priority assigned to roads, and on the condition of existing bridges.&#13;
Bridges would be built to accommodate current and future international loading standards&#13;
for the existing category roads (see para. 2.7). In the flood-prone areas of the Mekong&#13;
Delta, the project will emphasize the construction and rehabilitation of bridges and the&#13;
protection of waterway embankments when they coincide with road embankments or when&#13;
water erosion may endanger the structure of road embankments. When connections exist&#13;
between roads and waterways, making the two transport modes complementary, the project&#13;
will include the provision or improvement of simple low-cost landings and piers for the&#13;
interchange of traffic. An estimated cost for bridge engineering is about 2 percent of the&#13;
estimated value of its civil works. The project will finance bridges with a maximum&#13;
construction cost of US$50,000 for each bridge.&#13;
3.16 Maintenance. A critical aspect of the road improvement component will be to&#13;
support the development of a maintenance management program and to introduce effective&#13;
routine road maintenance. Two important factors that lead to insufficient routine&#13;
maintenance on rural roads were identified as weak organization and lack of funds. The&#13;
project will assist the PPMUs in setting up routine maintenance, emphasizing prompt&#13;
maintenance on critical sections. The system of lengthman and an organized maintenance&#13;
team to be in charge of certain sections of the road will be emphasized where appropriate.&#13;
A standard routine maintenance practice will be developed with the 15 provinces under the&#13;
project. The credit will provide maintenance funds for one year after the rehabilitation work&#13;
is completed on each road link under the project. During the one-year period the PPMUs,&#13;
district engineer offices, and local communities will be provided-with maintenance tools and&#13;
appropriate training to undertake the maintenance work on a more regular basis. After a&#13;
one-year training period and with the appropriate tools, district engineer offices should be&#13;
able to plan, organize, and manage routine maintenance more effectively. Further incentives&#13;
for promoting effective routine maintenance will be developed during the first year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
3.17 Maintenance will be done by low-cost and simplified techniques using labor-based&#13;
approaches supplemented with small-scale equipment such as tractors, tractor-drawn&#13;
graders, trailers, and compactors. Annual maintenance and repair of critical spots could be&#13;
contracted out to private contractors for district roads and to communes for communal and&#13;
intercommunal roads. Community participation approaches will be encouraged for&#13;
maintenance of communal roads, to be worked out as mentioned in paragraphs 3.11 and&#13;
4.9. Routine maintenance will be carried out following the procedure described in the OM.&#13;
3.18  Technical Advisory and Supervision. An international consultant and a group of&#13;
national consultants will be hired under the project to provide technical support to the PID&#13;
and PPMUs in the overall supervision of the project (para. 4.4).&#13;
3.19  Institutional Strengthening and Training. The project will provide support for&#13;
project management, implementation, and institutional strengthening of implementing&#13;
agencies at the central and provincial levels, including accounting and auditing of project&#13;
account. The component will also support the development of local contractors.&#13;
(a)    At the central level, the project will assist in strengthening the capacity in&#13;
the MOT to provide support and guidance to the PDOT during project&#13;
implementation and to monitor and evaluate their work afterward; in&#13;
developing a computerized rural roads information system that can aid in&#13;
road maintenance planning and programming procedures, and in reporting,&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation; and in developing technical performance&#13;
criteria and standards for lower category roads.&#13;
(b)    At the provincial level, the component aims to assist local authorities with&#13;
simple revenue and expenditure review to ensure that proper planning,&#13;
budgeting, and management funding is provided for needed rural&#13;
infrastructure; to implement the OM developed during project preparation;&#13;
and to conduct on-the-job training in planning and programming and&#13;
construction supervision, and to organize training for contractors and local&#13;
government officials.&#13;
(c)    In keeping with the national policy, which is to fund the rural road&#13;
construction and maintenance effort from the national budget and execute&#13;
the effort with local capability, project roads will be built by local&#13;
contractors who will receive training under the project. The project would&#13;
provide funds for classroom and on-the-job training to prospective&#13;
contractors in bid preparation, cost accounting, and contract management,&#13;
using standard procurement procedures to introduce them to the concept&#13;
of operating and managing small contract works in a competitive bidding&#13;
environment. The contractors can then use this knowledge when&#13;
competing for works under the project.&#13;
3.20  Contractor training services will be provided by a consultant to be engaged under&#13;
the project. The training program for the first year will include contractors from the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
four provinces, and expand to cover the rest of the project provinces in the following two&#13;
years. Upon completing their training, the contractors will be provisionally registered by&#13;
the PDOT as eligible to be awarded contracts. This will distribute the work to many&#13;
contractors, and encourage competition and labor-based and light equipment approaches.&#13;
A limited amount of contractor training will be provided prior to project effectiveness under&#13;
existing grant funding.&#13;
3.21  As part of the training exercise on modem bidding standards for registered&#13;
contractors, a bracketing system will be allowed for the first five NCB contracts in each of&#13;
the 15 provinces. Therefore, bidding documents will include schedules of quantities and&#13;
standard unit prices from engineer's estimates. The trained and registered contractors will&#13;
be required to submit quotations of their own unit rates or, altematively, to quote a unit&#13;
price as a percentage of the given prices. Brackets of 25 percent discount or premium on&#13;
individual items and within a 10 percent of the total contract will be allowed. Starting from&#13;
the sixth contract in each province, bidding documents wili not include cost, and bracketing&#13;
will be eliminated.&#13;
3.22 A Rural Road Information System based on a Geographic Information System -&#13;
Transportation will be established in the PID to enhance data collection, manipulation, and&#13;
analysis of the rural road network system. This will be a simplified version of a similar&#13;
system currently being developed by the MOT for the national network. The system will&#13;
aid in road maintenance planning and programming procedures, and in the long term will&#13;
support other road administration functions such as reporting, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
Funds from the project will be used to purchase hardware and software, as well as database&#13;
design, training, and data conversion. The PID will initiate the process to set up the&#13;
proposed system in the second year of the project. At negotiations agreement was reached&#13;
that a service contract to implement the system be finalized by June 30, 1999. Draft Terms&#13;
of Reference for the task are shown in Annex 3.&#13;
3.23  Long-term training as well as short courses, study tours, and workshops will be&#13;
supported under the project. During negotiations agreement was reached that the&#13;
Govermment will submit to IDA for approval by March 31 of each year, beginning in 1997,&#13;
a proposed training program for the central Govermment and provincial staff involved in the&#13;
project, and that the Govermnent will implement the approved program.&#13;
3.24  Study. A Rural Transport Investment Strategy Study will be included in the project&#13;
to identify issues related to demand and investment in the rural transport sector and to&#13;
establish guidelines for future investment. The study will assess the existing practice of&#13;
rural transport infrastructure investment decisions, rationalize rural infrastructure&#13;
investment expenditures, address the main constraints to resource mobilization, and&#13;
estimate the resources necessary to effectively improve the core rural network. Draft&#13;
Terms of Reference for the task are shown in Annex 4.&#13;

C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
3.25 Estimates of project costs are VND 816.5 billion, or US$60.89 million equivalent,&#13;
including physical and price contingencies (US$9.4 million). The foreign exchange&#13;
component is estimated to be US$15.13 million, or 25 percent of the total project cost. A&#13;
summary of costs by project component is given in Table 3.1, and further details are in&#13;

3.26  The cost of civil works and construction material is based on recent tender prices,&#13;
experience with other IDA projects, and estimates by consulting engineers. Costs for&#13;
vehicles and equipment are based on recent procurement during the project preparation&#13;
period. All-inclusive costs per staff-month for foreign specialist services are estimated based&#13;
on regional and international consultants rates. Costs for local specialist services are&#13;
estimated based on local experience. A total of 210 staff-months of local specialists and 70&#13;
staff-months of foreign specialists will be required.&#13;
3.27  All base costs are estimated in January 1996 prices. Physical contingencies of 10&#13;
percent of the base cost estimate have been applied to all components. Price contingencies&#13;
have been calculated for foreign and local costs. When expressed in US dollars, the&#13;
escalation for foreign and local costs is based on expected international annual price&#13;
increases of 2.0 percent in 1996, 1.62 percent from 1997 to 1999, and 2.23 percent after&#13;
2000. When expressed in Vietnamese Dong, the increase is based on expected domestic&#13;

Project Financing&#13;
3.28  IDA will finance 91 percent of road rehabilitation and maintenance and 100 percent&#13;
of institutional strengthening components, or 90.3 percent of total project cost. The&#13;
Government will finance 9 percent of roads works and 100 percent of the study, or 9.7&#13;
percent of total project cost.&#13;

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   The project will be implemented by the MOT and fifteen selected PDOT. At the&#13;
central level, a Project Implementation Division (PID) will be set up under the ministry's&#13;
Project Management Unit 18 (PMU18) and headed by a full-time division manager. The&#13;
Director General ofPMU18 will also serve as Project Director of this project. The PID will&#13;
be responsible for monitoring and guiding project implementation. The unit's role will be&#13;
limited to coordination and support functions and implementation of subcomponents procured&#13;
under international competitive bidding (ICB). Project implementation will be decentralized&#13;
to each project province. A PPMU will be established in each PDOT. Each provincial unit&#13;
will prepare annual workplans, procure engineering and civil works, evaluate bids, and submit&#13;
evaluation reports to the selection committee that awards contracts. In addition, the&#13;
provincial units will coordinate contract maintenance activities for lengthman and small-scale&#13;
contractors as well as community labor organized through district offices. A detailed&#13;
description of the functions of the PID and PPMUs, as well as other units involved in project&#13;
implementation, is included in the OM. During negotiations an agreement was reached that as&#13;
a condition of effectiveness, PID and PPMUs of the first four provinces be established and&#13;
heads of the five units appointed. Documentation of the organizational arrangements and the&#13;
staffing plan was presented to IDA for review and comments prior to negotiations.&#13;
4.2   Briefly, the PID will be responsible for monitoring and guiding such activities as&#13;
annual budget allocation, physical targets and training plans, review and approval of eligibility&#13;
criteria, and financial and physical commitments. The unit will also supervise and manage&#13;
ICB-procured components such as technical assistance, studies, training and any bulk&#13;
purchase of goods; prepare an aggregate disbursement plan, statement of expenditures, and&#13;
data sheets to be sent to IDA; provide technical guidance and training to PPMUs' staff, and&#13;
organize and develop interprovincial technical exchanges among unit managers.&#13;
4.3   The PPMU will undertake the day-to-day implementation activities and be responsible&#13;
for: (i) preparing annual workplans including civil works, maintenance activities, and training&#13;
needs; (ii) organizing and managing financial, accounting, and payment activities for road&#13;
works and maintenance; (iii) arranging for bidding, bid evaluation, recommendations for&#13;
contract awards, contracting, and supervision of engineering design and construction; (iv)&#13;
organizing community-based labor through district offices; (v) preparing annual disbursement&#13;
plans; (vi) preparing appropriate documentation to support statement of expenditures; (vii)&#13;
collecting data on physical, financial, and other progress indicators that support project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) analyzing data and recommending improvement of&#13;
policies, guidelines, and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
4.4   The national staff of the PID will be complemented by an international expert whose&#13;
draft Terms of Reference are in Annex 6. These experts will provide technical expertise and&#13;
training to the national staff and serve as resource persons to address project-related policy&#13;
and technical issues. Technical assistance to the PPMUs will be provided mainly by the&#13;
trained staff of the national support unit, supported by international experts.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.5   Because much of the responsibility for implementation will be given to local&#13;
authorities, who have diverse capabilities, implementation methods need to be flexible,&#13;
realistic, and practical. Implementation arrangements should fit well with the project design&#13;
and be open to such diverse implementation methods as community-organized labor, direct&#13;
contracting, and national competitive bidding.&#13;
4.6   Project implementation procedures and guidelines for technical and administrative&#13;
matters will follow the Operational Manual. A draft version of this manual was prepared and&#13;
submitted to IDA for review and comments prior to negotiations. During negotiations, the&#13;
draft OM was further discussed and finalized. Agreement was reached during negotiations&#13;
that the adoption of OM satisfactory to IDA will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.7   Selection of Roads to be Financed under the Project. Roads will be selected&#13;
according to a set of eligibility conditions as defined in the Operational Manual and&#13;
summarized in paragraphs 3.14 - 3.15. Annual work programs for other components such as&#13;
rural road maintenance, assistance to small-scale contractors, and other institutional&#13;
strengthening will be reviewed annually. During negotiations agreement was reached that&#13;
MOT will prepare and submit to IDA for approval on August 31 of each year, beginning in&#13;
1997, a proposed annual work program and budget for project activities in the following&#13;
calendar year, including a list of road links to be improved, and thereafter implement the&#13;
annual work program as approved by IDA. The first-year program was discussed and agreed&#13;
to at negotiations. However, action plans will be prepared separately in certain cases. An&#13;
ethnic minorities development plan (para. 5.14) will be prepared for road links in areas&#13;
inhabited by ethnic minorities. Environmental Impact Assessments (para. 5.11) will be&#13;
prepared for roads in environmentally sensitive areas. Similarly, Resettlement Action Plans or&#13;
inventories (para. 5.13) will be prepared for road links that involve resettlement.&#13;
4.8   A set of social criteria stipulated in the OM will be used to target roads that serve&#13;
areas inhabited by the very poor and minorities, which do not usually meet the general&#13;
population and economic criteria. The OM would provide that no more than 20 percent of&#13;
project funds can be allocated for road works based on social criteria alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
4.9    Community Participation. When communes are the direct beneficiaries of the road&#13;
segment and the work does not require substantial construction skills, the commune or&#13;
communities within the commune will be contracted to undertake the work using the&#13;
Government price list to determine the contract value. A typical bill of quantities for spot&#13;
improvement works is shown in Annex 7. Supervision of work will be done by the district&#13;
offices. As indicated in paragraph 3.11, a pilot scheme will be implemented during the first&#13;
year. PID, PPMUs, and external technical experts will help make necessary adjustments to&#13;
incorporate lessons gained from the first-year operation.&#13;
4.10  Implementation Schedule. Because of the large number of provinces covered under&#13;
the project and the need to test the procedures developed during the preparation stage, a&#13;
sequential approach will be adopted for project implementation. The first-year program will&#13;
serve as a pilot and demonstration project to test and modify, as warranted, all technical and&#13;
administrative guidelines stipulated in the OM. Government staff and contractors will also be&#13;
trained. Therefore the first-year program will include a representative sample of road works,&#13;
including surfacing, bridges, and drainage structure improvement or rehabilitation. Thus a&#13;
variety of technical problems and solutions, administrative procedures, and contracting,&#13;
training, and institutional development needs will be addressed. The first-year program will&#13;
ensure that demonstration sites are easily accessible.&#13;
4.11   Project implementation activities will start in four of the fifteen provinces covered&#13;
under the project once the credit is effective; the remaining eleven provinces will enter the&#13;
program after the first project year. The order and timing of provincial entry will depend on&#13;
how well prepared the province is and on the ability of the management units in each province.&#13;
The Government has expressed its intention to start the second group within six months of the&#13;
start-up of the first group. To ensure smooth start-up, the eleven remaining provinces will&#13;
begin their pre-implementation activities about six months prior to the actual start of&#13;
implementation. Pre-implementation activities include briefing and training for administrative,&#13;
technical, and financial management staff of the project in each province. The Government's&#13;
goal is to implement the rehabilitation work in all fifteen provinces in three years. The first-&#13;
year review will examine the feasibility of this goal and modify it, if necessary, taking into&#13;
consideration the achievements of the first-year program.&#13;
4.12 Agreement was reached that MOT will prepare and furnish to IDA a first-year project&#13;
review report no later than January 31, 1998, and a joint MOT/IDA review mission will be&#13;
carried out by March 31, 1998 (para. 4.32). The first-year review will include:&#13;
(a)   the need for revising the Operational Manual (para. 4. 6);&#13;
(b)   procurement and other issues relating to community-organized civil works&#13;
(paras. 3.11 and 4.9); and&#13;
(c)   implementation timetable (para. 4.11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
C. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.13  The PID will monitor, evaluate, and report on the project's activities and expenditures,&#13;
based on information provided by the provincial offices. Progress wili be measured against&#13;
the key indicators agreed on by the Government and IDA (Annex 2).&#13;
4.14 On the basis of these key indicators, the MOT will develop and implement a&#13;
computerized monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system. Data will be collected at the&#13;
provincial level and processed by the PMU 18. A short-term specialist with experience in&#13;
computerized project management will assist in the establishment of the project monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system, train staff and periodically follow up on system implementation.&#13;
During negotiations agreement was reached that MOT will, by December 31, 1997, establish&#13;
and maintain operational procedure satisfactory to IDA for project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
based on performance indicators satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.6).&#13;
4.15  The PID will be responsible for preparing semi-annual reports using the key&#13;
performance indicators as the basis for assessing implementation progress. The report will&#13;
also identify possible problems or impediments and make specific recommendations for&#13;
remedial action. During negotiations assurance was sought that the PID will prepare and&#13;
submit to IDA semi-annual progress reports by March 31 and September 30 of each year&#13;
commencing September 30, 1997.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.16 Procurement under the project will be in line with IDA procurement guidelines and&#13;
procedures (Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995&#13;
and revised in 1996, and Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency of August 1981). A summary of procurement&#13;
arrangements is shown in Table 4 .1.&#13;

4.17   As discussed in paragraph 4.2, the PID will be responsible for procurement of such&#13;
items as technical assistance, studies, rural roads information system, and purchase of office&#13;
equipment and furniture to be used at headquarters and in the provinces. The PPMUs will be&#13;
responsible for procuring all road works executed under the project in their provinces, as well&#13;
as some equipment, supplies, and furniture to be purchased locally. Because the operational&#13;
capacity of PID and PPMUs are currently weak, support to strengthen their institutional&#13;
capacity has been included in the project (paras. 3.19-3.23).&#13;
4.18 Civil Works. Civil works (US$53.8 million) will mainly include upgrading the level&#13;
of service of selected district feeder roads and commune access roads by constructing missing&#13;
bridges, improving road drainage systems, and providing regraveling. Works will also include&#13;
the protection of waterway banks when these coincide with road embankments or when they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
endanger the safety of the road. Some direct contracting will be used for packages of up to&#13;
US$10,000 for small-scale labor-based contractors and community-organized labor. The total&#13;
value of procurement under direct contracting will not exceed US$8 million. Contracts up to&#13;
US$50,000 (total about US$10 million) may be procured, using lump-sum fixed price or unit&#13;
price contracts, according to simplified procurement procedures for works, similar to&#13;
shopping among trained, qualified and registered domestic contractors in the appropriate&#13;
category by soliciting quotations from at least three of them. Contracts above US$50,000&#13;
equivalent (about US$30 million) will be procured according to national competitive bidding&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. There will be no ICB for civil works since works under the&#13;
project are small, scattered across fifteen provinces, and not technically complex, and thus are&#13;
unlikely to attract foreign competition. A summary of the typical bill of quantities for works&#13;
under the first-year program to be financed under the project is shown in Annex 7. The&#13;
project's OM includes some sample bidding documents developed in compliance with IDA's&#13;
procedures on standard bidding documents for small works (paras. 3.13 and 4.6).&#13;
4.19  Goods. Goods to be procured under the project (US$2.5 million) will be suitably&#13;
packaged and procured by the PID and PPMUs as appropriate. Because of the small-scale&#13;
requirements, vehicles, motorbikes and laboratory equipment will be packaged into lots of less&#13;
than US$150,000 and procured by international shopping with at least three price quotations&#13;
from at least two countries in accordance with IDA guidelines, and with an aggregate value&#13;
not exceeding US$1.5 million. The rest will be procured through ICB. All furniture required&#13;
for the project, totaling about US$0.3 million, will be financed fully by the Government and&#13;
procured according to Government guidelines. Domestic preferences of 15 percent of the CIF&#13;
price or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower will apply to domestically manufactured&#13;
goods under ICB procurement and the Bank's standard bidding documents will be used for&#13;
ICB procurement.&#13;
4.20  Consulting and Training. Consulting services totaling 70 staff-months of&#13;
international and 210 staff-months of national expertise, and foreign and local seminars and&#13;
training and road information system (estimated to cost US$3.7 million), engineering contract&#13;
(costing about US$0.52 million) and studies (costing US$0.5 million) will be procured on the&#13;
basis of the Government's guidelines for the use of consultants and will use the Bank's&#13;
Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services.&#13;
4.21  Review of Procurement. IDA will conduct a prior review of all documents&#13;
concerning the tendering and award of: (i) all goods; (ii) all consultancy contracts financed by&#13;
IDA that exceed US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals; (iii) roads in forest&#13;
buffer zones; (iv) all road works involving resettlement; (v) roads in ethnic minorities areas;&#13;
and (vi) the first three civil works contracts of each PPMU and all contracts estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$150,000 equivalent per contract. Contracts not covered under the categories&#13;
mentioned above will be retained by the PID and PPMUs and reviewed by IDA on a random&#13;
basis. For consultant services to be financed by IDA, the prior review will include terms of&#13;
reference, short lists, letters of invitation, recommendations for award, and the final contract.&#13;
In addition, all terms of reference, single source selection of consulting firms, regardless of the&#13;
contract value, are also subject to prior Bank review. Even though normally about 80 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
of the value of IDA-financed procurement would be subjected to prior review, the project&#13;
justified a lower coverage since there is a large number of similar or repetitive contracts.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.22  The project will be completed by June 30, 2001, five years after credit effectiveness.&#13;
The credit closing date will be December 31, 2001, six months after the expected completion.&#13;
The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8.&#13;
4.23  The proposed allocation of the credit and percentage of expenditure to be financed by&#13;
IDA will be as follows:&#13;
(a)   95 percent of total cost of civil works;&#13;
(b)   100 percent of total expenditure on technical assistance, workshops, and&#13;
training; and&#13;
(c)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment;&#13;
100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured&#13;
equipment and 65 percent of total expenditures for other locally procured&#13;
items.&#13;
4.24  To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account will be opened with an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$5.0 million representing the estimated average expenditures for a four-month&#13;
period. However, an initial deposit to the Special Account shall be limited to US$3.5 million&#13;
until disbursements and outstanding commitments against the credit shall be equal to or&#13;
exceed the equivalent of SDR 10 million. The account will be opened in U.S. dollars in a&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will cover IDA's share of eligible expenses in&#13;
both local and foreign currencies. Applications for replenishment of the special account,&#13;
supported by appropriate documentation would be submitted regularly -preferably monthly,&#13;
but not less than quarterly- or when the amounts withdrawn equal 20 percent of the initial&#13;
deposit.&#13;
4.25  Under a centralized fiscal system but with decentralized physical execution, it is&#13;
important to design a report flow and funds flow mechanism that can efficiently and speedily&#13;
channel funds to subprojects without sacrificing centralized quality control. Based on budget&#13;
approval of expenditure under the project (yearly or quarterly) and invoices certified by&#13;
PPMUs and PID, the General Department for Development Investment (GDDI) will pay&#13;
IDA's share out of the Special Account. The withdrawals from the Special Account will be&#13;
made under the joint signature of the Project Director and the GDDI director; the counterpart&#13;
fund will be paid by the GDDI through its provincial offices. The report flow and fund flow&#13;
mechanism is shown in Annex 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
4.26  For reasons of efficiency, the project will pay for output (itemized works) against&#13;
measured progress and prorated lump-sum or unit price contracts. After the contractors have&#13;
finished part of the work, the district engineer will check and certify that the work has been&#13;
done according to the contract. A copy of the contracts and certified bills will be sent to the&#13;
PPMU, which will approve and pass it on to the PID. After approving the certified bills, the&#13;
PID will pass the bills on to GDDI for further review. After being satisfied with its review,&#13;
GDDI will pay the counterpart funding portion to the contractors and authorize the Special&#13;
Account service bank to pay IDA share directly to the contractor. The PID will prepare a&#13;
replenishment application on a monthly basis and send it to the External Finance Department&#13;
(EFD) under MOF to review the expenditures and prepare the withdrawal application. EFD&#13;
will then have the application signed by State Bank of Vietnam and send it to IDA for Special&#13;
Account replenishment. Any inconsistencies will be corrected by the EFD at this stage.&#13;
During negotiations the funds flow mechanism (Annex 9) was discussed and confirmed. The&#13;
project will also support an establishment of an accounting system in PID capable of&#13;
monitoring the funds flow mechanism and recording all transactions under the project, in&#13;
particular the SOE records.&#13;
4.27  Full documentation will be required for services obtained from consulting firms under&#13;
contracts exceeding US$ 100,000 and, in the case of individual consultants, for contracts&#13;
exceeding US$50,000, all goods, and for works procured under contracts exceeding&#13;
US$150,000. All other disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure (SOE)&#13;
prepared by the PID. Supporting documents will be made available to IDA's supervision&#13;
missions and to the auditor.&#13;
4.28   Conditions for disbursement include:&#13;
(a)   on resettlement issue: specific RAPs will be required if 150 or more people are&#13;
affected in a road link. If fewer than 150 people are affected, a time-bound&#13;
action plan for compensation and resettlement will be prepared in accordance&#13;
with the agreed Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Compensation, and&#13;
Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons (para. 5.12). The submission to and&#13;
approval of a specific RAP or action plan by IDA and completion of&#13;
resettlement activities will be a condition of disbursement for road links (para.&#13;
5.13);&#13;
(b)   on environmental issue: the Government will prepare and submit to IDA an&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment for roads located within forest buffer zones&#13;
including a time-bound action plan for undertaking the environmental&#13;
mitigating measures before disbursement is made against civil works and goods&#13;
for such roads (para. 5.11); and&#13;
(c)   on ethnic minorities issue: for road links to be built in ethnic minorities areas,&#13;
an ethnic minorities development plan will be prepared and submitted to IDA&#13;
for approval prior to disbursements for works on such roads (para. 5.14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
F. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
4.29  During negotiations assurance was obtained from the Government that: (i) separate&#13;
project accounts will be established for their respective components at the MOT and PDOT;&#13;
(ii) provincial offices will be responsible for filing a monthly report on the project's account to&#13;
the PID; (iii) Special Account and project accounts, including documentation for SOEs, will&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, with the audit including a&#13;
separate opinion on the use of the SOEs and the status of audit compliance; (iv) IDA funds&#13;
can be used to finance expenditures incurred in arranging for the project annual audit report;&#13;
and (v) the detailed audit report will be submitted to IDA within nine months of the closing of&#13;
the government's fiscal year. The first-year audit report will cover the period from January to&#13;
December 1997.&#13;
G. PROJECT MONITORING AND IDA SUPERVISION&#13;
4.30  Physical progress as well as other aspects of the project will be monitored by MOT&#13;
following forms and indicators included in the OM and agreed to at negotiations. Any land&#13;
and compensation matters, environmental effects, or questions about the quality of selection&#13;
and implementation of works will be reviewed on a sampling basis by IDA.&#13;
4.31  IDA will conduct project supervision missions at six-month intervals during project&#13;
implementation, with first-year and midterm reviews to evaluate progress made and determine&#13;
necessary actions. The expected timing and expertise requirements for these missions are&#13;
included in Annex 10. In preparation for IDA missions, the PID will compile and submit&#13;
semiannual progress reports to IDA, including the key progress indicators from the previous&#13;
six-month period (paras. 3.6 and 4.14).&#13;
4.32  There will be a joint MOT/IDA first-year review of the project (para. 4.12) to assess&#13;
progress made during the pilot program and to modify the OM, if necessary. Prior to the&#13;
review mission, the Government will prepare and submit to IDA an assessment of progress&#13;
made in achieving project objectives, technical assistance performance, and the need to modify&#13;
the OM. The Government will also prepare a program of action to address any deficiencies in&#13;
project design or implementation identified in the assessment.&#13;
4.33  A midterm review will be done in the third year of the project. Project design,&#13;
implementation procedures, and project objectives will be reviewed. During negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached that the Government will prepare and submit the midterm review&#13;
report to IDA by December 31, 1998 for a joint review mission in March 31, 1999.&#13;

5. JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS, AND RISKS&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
5.1   The proposed project has been assigned a high priority in the Government and IDA's&#13;
work program because it is a key element in tackling rural development and poverty&#13;
alleviation. By directing funds to improve selected infrastructure in local governments and&#13;
communities, the project will strengthen stakeholder ownership, which provides incentives for&#13;
the communities to help maintain the rehabilitated assets after the project is completed.&#13;
5.2   Vietnam's new economic policies, particularly the emphasis on light industry and the&#13;
economic responsibility system in agriculture, are creating a rapidly growing demand for&#13;
transport. In rural areas agricultural production and the increasing production of households&#13;
and rural enterprises must be transported, often rapidly, to nearby towns and neighboring&#13;
areas. Thus substantial improvement of the rural transport infrastructure is required. Rural&#13;
transport systems will create opportunities to exploit resources for which low-cost motorized&#13;
transport is required, and will accrue benefits to the residents of the areas served. The detailed&#13;
economic analysis for the project given below focuses on the rural road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance component, which accounts for about 80 percent of the project cost.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
5.3   Road Influence Areas. The project covers fifteen poor provinces where per capita&#13;
GDP ranges from US$61 (32 percent of the country average) in Ha Giang to US$143 (74&#13;
percent of country average) in Minh Hai. The weighted average per capita GDP of the project&#13;
provinces is US$106, or about 56 percent of the country average (Annex 11). The population&#13;
of the fifteen project provinces totals about 20 million, with an area of about 40 percent of the&#13;
country but with 30 percent of the road network. The detailed road network map prepared&#13;
during project preparation shows that an average of 5 percent of the network in these&#13;
provinces is classified as national road, 7 percent is provincial road, 14 percent is district road,&#13;
and 74 percent is communal road. Assuming that 20 percent of the population in these&#13;
provinces are urban residents and that the rest are distributed evenly on provincial, district, and&#13;
communal roads with a normal distribution curve, one kilometer of district road has a direct&#13;
influence on about 2.27 square kilometers and about 300 people (Annex 11).&#13;
5.4   Project Benefits. The project assumes that about one-third of the direct benefit areas&#13;
are cultivable, and that the majority of the low-value crop in Vietnam is paddy. The national&#13;
average yield per hectare of paddy land is 3.5 tons, and that the domestic market price of&#13;
paddy is about US$0.2 per kilogram. Using a conservative approach, the project assumes that&#13;
the benefit of better roads and lower transport costs will contribute to a gradual increase in&#13;
commercialized paddy production of about 1 percent a year starting from the second year of&#13;
road rehabilitation to the sixth year, with farm productivity stabilizing afterwards. The value of&#13;
paddy production that is directly influenced by one kilometer of road is US$530 in the second&#13;
year and US$2,648 in the sixth year. The project also assumes a 2 percent reduction in losses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
from the transport of agricultural products on poor condition roads relative to the "without&#13;
project scenario".&#13;
5.5   Project Costs. For the base case scenario, the cost of spot improvement on district&#13;
and communal roads is US$7,200 a kilometer, which is the average cost estimated during the&#13;
project preparation using simplified engineering methods (para. 3.9). Routine maintenance for&#13;
this type of road in Vietnam using lengthman and simple road maintenance tools cost about&#13;
US$137 a kilometer per year. Periodic maintenance will be required every ten years, so the&#13;
cost-benefit stream is only calculated for the first ten years after the project is initiated.&#13;
5.6   Economic Rates of Return. Starting from the second year, benefits are about 20&#13;
percent of the investment cost. As shown in Annex 12, the estimated Net Present Value&#13;
(NPV) at a 12 percent discount factor is US$7,791 per kilometer of rehabilitated roads and the&#13;
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is 32.5 percent. The sensitivity analysis shows that even if&#13;
costs more than double, to US$15,000 a kilometer, the investment is still viable, with a NPV of&#13;
US$827 per kilometer and an ERR of 13.3 percent. However, if the investment cost increases&#13;
further to US$20,000 a kilometer or if it stays at US$15,000 a kilometer but benefits are&#13;
reduced by 25 percent, then NPVs will become negative and ERRs are reduced to about 7&#13;
percent (Annex 12). From this analysis it is concluded that investment costs over US$15,000 a&#13;
kilometer will be justified only if the investment is in areas where higher value crops are&#13;
produced on a commercial scale, and that economic analysis for such investment would be&#13;
required.&#13;
5.7   Nonquantifiable Benefits. Since labor costs account for more than 30 percent of the&#13;
total cost for road rehabilitation, the project is estimated to generate about US$14 million of&#13;
wage income to local labor. The employment and cash compensation of populations in poor&#13;
provinces is an important feature of the project. Many villagers in the selected provinces&#13;
maintain subsistence livelihoods, with minimum cash incomes. Therefore the cash income to&#13;
be eamed under the project will provide important additional resources to these&#13;
underprivileged villagers.&#13;
5.8   Labor-based methods can be successful and competitive with equipment-based&#13;
methods in countries, like Vietnam, where labor costs are very low. Where unskilled villagers&#13;
are willing to work for the equivalent of US$1 a day, capital-intensive methods are not&#13;
attractive. Further, since it is likely that local populations will be involved in maintaining road&#13;
assets once rehabilitation works are completed, using them for rehabilitation works under the&#13;
project will provide them with the on-the-job training and skills needed to perform proper&#13;
maintenance afterward. As a result maintenance will be more sustainable and of a higher&#13;
quality than in the past, when unskilled and unpaid labor were used for road maintenance.&#13;
5.9   Because institutional strengthening efforts are directed toward the provincial levels, it is&#13;
expected that by the end of the project all fifteen selected PDOTs will gain technical and&#13;
administrative knowledge that enables them to efficiently manage and maintain the rural road&#13;
networks in their provinces. In addition, once the small-scale contractors in the provinces have&#13;
gained project management and cost accounting experience, they will be able to compete in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
country's fast-growing competitive bidding environment. If this approach is successful it can&#13;
be disseminated to the country's 38 other provinces.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMACT&#13;
5.10  The project has been classified in environmental Category B. The scope of the project&#13;
works are limited to the rehabilitation and maintenance of selected district feeder roads and&#13;
communal access roads. These activities are not expected to compromise environmental&#13;
quality or destroy natural habitats. Road improvements will ensure proper drainage and&#13;
enhance soil stability, as well as provide greater vehicular and pedestrian safety through&#13;
improvements to road surfaces and embankments, and the construction of missing bridges.&#13;
Overall, the project's environmental impact is expected to be small and mostly positive. Given&#13;
the project's sequential approach and the small environmental impact expected, no&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment will be prepared up front. Progress reports will indicate any&#13;
problems encountered and solutions adopted during implementation.&#13;
5.11  To ensure that contractors employ appropriate techniques to protect the environment&#13;
during construction, instructions, prototype designs, and guidelines have been prepared and&#13;
included in the OM. To protect forests and reserved land, road eligibility criteria will ensure&#13;
that the roads selected under the project are limited to those roads that link villages to market&#13;
centers, not to forest areas. During negotiations agreement was reached that no roads will be&#13;
financed in reserved areas. In the forest buffer zones, an Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
will be prepared and submitted to IDA for approval prior to disbursement for any section of&#13;
road in the buffer zones.&#13;
C. LAND ACQUISITION AND INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT&#13;
5.12 Road rehabilitation using spot improvement methods normally does not require&#13;
widening roads or acquiring land. To the contrary, it often limits the spreading of roads onto&#13;
adjacent fields in several tracks. Therefore it is expected that most of the roads rehabilitated&#13;
under the project will occupy the same or even less land when improved. However, since only&#13;
the details of the first-year program have been planned which do not include works causing&#13;
land acquisition, the future need for minor additional strips of land cannot be ruled out. During&#13;
negotiations a Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Compensation, and Rehabilitation&#13;
satisfactory to IDA was agreed upon. This framework will contain the procedures to be&#13;
followed for rehabilitation of roads requiring additional land, including the principles for land&#13;
acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation; the institutional and legal framework, including&#13;
entitlement policies; implementation arrangements; rules for local participation in&#13;
implementation; grievance redressal mechanisms; and provisions for internal and external&#13;
monitoring, all of which are satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
5.13  During negotiations agreement was reached that when 150 or more people are affected&#13;
by a road link, specific Resettlement Action Plans will be required. These road-specific reports&#13;
will include results of socioeconomic surveys and censuses of all parties affected by the&#13;
project; detailed compensation and resettlement or rehabilitation plans for the various groups&#13;
affected by the project; a timetable for implementation; organizational responsibilities for&#13;
implementation; a detailed budget for funding the various compensation and rehabilitation&#13;
measures; and internal and external monitoring arrangements. If fewer than 150 people are&#13;
affected, a time-bound action plan for compensation and resettlement will be prepared in&#13;
accordance with the framework (see para. 5.12). The submission to and approval of a specific&#13;
RAP or action plan by IDA and completion of resettlement activities will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for those road links. At negotiations agreement was reached that by March 31,&#13;
1997 PID will retain an independent agency or agencies with qualified and experienced staff&#13;
and terms of reference acceptable to IDA to periodically carry out external monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the action plans, and to prepare an annual report to submit to PID and IDA by&#13;
August 31 of each year starting in 1997.&#13;
D. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND ETHNIC MINORITIES&#13;
5.14  Population density in the road service area is one of the main eligibility criteria for road&#13;
selection. While this approach spreads the benefits of the project to a large portion of the&#13;
population, it tends to exclude sparsely populated and mountainous areas, where most ethnic&#13;
minorities live. Even with the refined selection criteria of incorporating an accessibility rating&#13;
- which gives higher priority to roads that are not presently accessible - this approach still&#13;
favors the coastal plain and excludes most mountainous areas. These economic criteria may&#13;
result in some of the poorest segments of society being left outside the project's reach. In&#13;
order to target mountain and ethnic populations, an understanding was reached at negotiations&#13;
that up to 20 percent of credit earmarked for rural access road rehabilitation may be used in&#13;
those areas justified under the social criteria (para. 3.14(c)). To ensure that ethnic minorities&#13;
are consulted during the planning stage and that they benefit from the road construction,&#13;
guidelines for preparing a development plan for ethnic minorities will be included in the OM.&#13;
During negotiations agreement was reached that an ethnic minorities' development plan is&#13;
prepared and submitted to IDA for approval prior to disbursements for works on road links in&#13;
areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.&#13;
E. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.15  Project sustainability will be enhanced by at least three actions. First, the project will&#13;
support the development of institutional and human resource capacity that will continue to&#13;
support road rehabilitation and maintenance once the project is completed. Second, the&#13;
project supports the rural roads information system and the setting up of an effective system&#13;
for rural maintenance management at the local level to ensure continued maintenance once the&#13;
project is complete. Furthermore, a Rural Infrastructure Investment Study will be conducted&#13;
to address the issues, problems, and needs relating to rural transport investment for Vietnam.&#13;
Third, project preparation has involved a series of participatory and interactive workshops&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
with national, provincial, and district stakeholders with a view to fostering local ownership of&#13;
the project.&#13;
5.16  Participation of beneficiaries during project preparation was achieved at two levels.&#13;
First, the staffs of the MOT and PDOT were actively involved in project preparation,&#13;
collecting data, consulting with other agencies, taking road inventories, mapping the entire&#13;
rural roads network and prioritizing roads for the first-year program, and developing and&#13;
refining various components of the project. Second, Government officials were provided with&#13;
training during project preparation. Two workshops were organized to discuss the project&#13;
concept and draft project design, drawing representatives of national and provincial agencies&#13;
involved in rural roads construction and maintenance. In addition, during project&#13;
implementation some works will be implemented by community-organized labor, which&#13;
requires the active involvement of beneficiaries at both the planning and implementation stages.&#13;
F. RIsKS&#13;
5.17 Because the project's design is somewhat innovative for the Government of Vietnam,&#13;
the project could be assumed to entail considerable risk. However, the risk of the "wrong"&#13;
project being chosen in each selected district and commune is small given the participatory&#13;
process involved (para. 5.16) and the immense interest of the central and local governments for&#13;
the project. Still, the main risks relating to implementation include: (i) Vietnam's lack of&#13;
experience with implementation of externally financed projects and competitive bidding, which&#13;
might delay contracting for and execution of project works; (ii) private contractors' lack of&#13;
experience with bidding procedures and works execution; (iii) failure to provide adequate&#13;
routine maintenance, partly because of the absence of good standard maintenance procedures&#13;
and mainly because of the lack of funds, which would result in early deterioration of the&#13;
rehabilitated roads; and (iv) the tight implementation schedule expected by the Government -&#13;
to complete the project in three years -  night not be fulfilled.&#13;
5.18  Consulting services provided during project preparation and technical assistance to be&#13;
provided during project implementation will minimize the technical risks. Training provided to&#13;
private contractors will minimize the risks in contracting works to the private sector. The&#13;
procedures for effective routine maintenance and management to be set up under the project&#13;
will minimize the risks relating to substandard maintenance. For the risk in extending the&#13;
implementation period, the project disbursement schedule assumes that roads will be&#13;
rehabilitated in five years instead of three. This schedule will not constrain the Government&#13;
from progressing more rapidly.&#13;

Viet Nam - Rural Transport Project&#13;
Rural Roads Information System&#13;
1.    MOT and its representatives in the provinces, PDOTs, are involved among other&#13;
things, in the collection and management of several layers of transportation related&#13;
information. These information is used by MOT and PDOTs in planning, design,&#13;
implementation and management of Transportation projects, as well as by other&#13;
government agencies, each for their own use. MOT has recognized the need for Modern&#13;
Information Technology to support these functions. Therefore, MOT should be&#13;
empowered to face these challenges by developing a system capable of storing,&#13;
maintaining and manipulating roads related information. The system would be based on&#13;
the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology which links digital maps to tabular&#13;
database and would be built at the top of advances already made in the Ministry of&#13;
Transport in this area. During project preparation, rural roads inventories were prepared&#13;
and entered in computerized tabular database (in Microsoft Excel format), and linked to&#13;
hard copy maps using a well defined spatial reference. The proposed work would include&#13;
preparing Rural Roads Information System Implementation Plan, build the first phase of&#13;
the implementation plan (a simple GIS system that can be used for data storage and&#13;
maintenance), and develop a simple application for Rural Roads Prioritization.&#13;
2.    The slow learning curve of absorbing the Information Technology is recognized&#13;
and should be taken into consideration throughout the program in order to ensure the&#13;
achievements of the project's physical targets. Therefore, implementation of Rural Roads&#13;
Information System will first be developed using a simple system that supports data&#13;
collection, storage and maintenance and the development of one application for Rural&#13;
Roads Prioritization's. The database would be designed so that in the future the system&#13;
would support applications such as planning, roads maintenance, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
System Components&#13;
3.    The scope of work for the project includes:&#13;
(a)    developing Rural Roads Information System Implementation Plan;&#13;
(b)   Implementing the first phase of the plan, including a simple application&#13;
using GIS to collect, store and manipulate Rural Roads Spatial Data;&#13;
(c)   development of a simple application for Rural Roads Prioritization; and&#13;
(d)   Training and Technology Transfer.&#13;
Implementation Plan&#13;
4.    The Consultant will review progress and performance of existing roads information&#13;
systems already in use in MOT and Other related agencies, document Hardware,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Software, and existing data models. Then, the Consultant would prepare Rural Roads&#13;
Implementation Plan to be used for rural roads building on the advances already made in&#13;
MOT in this area. This would include definition of Hardware, Software, data model and&#13;
developing strategies for System Architecture and implementation strategy. Furthermore,&#13;
the study would identify the business needs and applications that would be supported by&#13;
the system.&#13;
Implementing Phase I of the Proposed Plan&#13;
5.    The consultant would implement Phase I of the proposed plan. This would include&#13;
purchase and installation of Hardware and Software, conversion of GIS related data for&#13;
Rural Roads Network and also National and Provincial Network for the 15 provinces. It is&#13;
preferably that data conversion, specially digitizing, be done by PMU 18 staff under direct&#13;
supervision from the consultants. However, Quality Control and the linkage between&#13;
Spatial and Tabular data would be the responsibility of the consultant,&#13;
6.    Spatial data that would be entered in the system include, administrative boundaries,&#13;
National, Provincial, District, and Communal boundaries if applicable. Roads Spatial data&#13;
would include National, Provincial, District and Communal Roads. Some of these spatial&#13;
data might already exist in Digital format, therefore the consultants might be required to&#13;
import these data into the system instead of digitizing it from hard copy maps.&#13;
Developing Simle Application for Rural Roads Prioritization&#13;
7.    Since the demand is so high compared to the available funds, prioritization of&#13;
roads to be included under the project is an important factor in the planning process.&#13;
Therefore, the consultant would develop an application for roads prioritization using the&#13;
methodology described in the Operational Manual. The methodology uses the No. of&#13;
beneficiaries per Km, Network considerations and socio-economic factors. Relevant&#13;
Chapters in the Operational Manual would be included in this TOR as an attachment.&#13;
Training and Technology Transfer&#13;
8.    The consultant would provide one week seminar for PMU18 and other MOT in&#13;
introduction of GIS Technology. Topics included are spatial data, spatial analysis, map&#13;
projection, database design, and applications of GIS in Transportation Management. The&#13;
consultant would also provide on the job training from PMUI8 staff to use the system. He&#13;
will also train PMU18 staff digitizing, Quality Control, Map Production, and system&#13;
customization.&#13;
9.    PMU1 8 would provide a full time information systems specialist to work with the&#13;
International Consultants. This person would be responsible for managing the system,&#13;
including data conversion for the rest of the Network after consultants departure. PMU1 8&#13;
would also provide low skilled staff for data entry including digitizing.&#13;

VIET NAM - RURAL TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY&#13;
STUDY TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Backiground&#13;
1.    The activities of the Rural Transport Project include three components:&#13;
(a)   rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance using sport improvement&#13;
techniques;&#13;
(b)   institutional strengthening and training of local contractors; and&#13;
(c)   a study to address the issues of rural transport development.&#13;
The project concept and design was based on preparation and planning work carried out&#13;
by a Government Project Preparation Team and consultants retained under a grant from&#13;
PHRD, Japan. Annex 1 presents a brief outline of the project objectives and components.&#13;
2.    This project is the first phase of a projected longer term program to improve the&#13;
rural access transport network in Viet Nam and its focus will be to promote economic and&#13;
social development and to alleviate poverty in rural areas by facilitating rural access and&#13;
enhancing opportunities for market agriculture surplus and integrating local populations&#13;
into regional and national economies. However, there is a paucity of detailed data and&#13;
information relating to Viet Nam economic, social, institutional and physical development&#13;
and about the inter-linkages between these different aspects of its development,&#13;
particularly in relation to the vast majority of its population that live and work in the rural&#13;
areas. The proposed study will provide an improved basis for policy formulation, strategy&#13;
development, investment planning and programming and institutional structures and&#13;
systems for future investments in and attention to improvement, operation and&#13;
maintenance of rural infrastructure. It will also apply these improved approaches to&#13;
formulate a strategy and plan of action that will guide projected follow on investments in&#13;
the rural infrastructure sector.&#13;
Study Objectives&#13;
3.    The study's sphere of interest will be the various elements of rural infrastructure&#13;
that impinge on the economic, social and welfare development of rural populations, in&#13;
particular, transport infrastructure both land and water based, but also, to the extent that&#13;
accessibility to economic, social and welfare facilities is directly related to the location of&#13;
these facilities, the study will consider issues related to location decisions for such&#13;
facilities. Accordingly, the study objectives are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-                         Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
(a)    To review the Government's ongoing policies, strategies and programs for&#13;
rural infrastructure development, operation and maintenance and for the&#13;
establishment and development of related institutional capacity;&#13;
(b)   To review the role of rural infrastructure and its use in facilitating&#13;
agricultural growth and rural development in Viet Nam and its role in&#13;
alleviating poverty and addressing the effects of poverty on rural people&#13;
including different social and minority groups and of each gender;&#13;
(c)    To assess current rural infrastructure constraints and needs, institutions and&#13;
policies, financing mechanisms, local capacity for construction and&#13;
maintenance and technology choices, particularly for using labor-based&#13;
approaches and natural materials for road and track improvements and&#13;
pavements and for travel and transport means that are simple, adequate and&#13;
affordable for the needs of rural populations;&#13;
(d)   In the light of the above reviews and assessments, to recommend any&#13;
changes required in existing policies, strategies, programs and institutions&#13;
and to elaborate a national strategy for the sub-sector consistent with Viet&#13;
NamO&#13;
modernization and industrialization and transition to a market economy as&#13;
well as its ongoing process of decentralization and its objectives to improve&#13;
rural access and service quality to the rural poor and thus enhance rural and&#13;
regional development.&#13;
4.    An important part of the study will be the development of a data bank on&#13;
accessibility and the needs of the rural infrastructure networks, their development,&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
Scoope of Work&#13;
5.    The first task will be to assemble and summarize the data on supply and demand&#13;
for rural infrastructure, the impacts of rural infrastructure (where available) in Viet Nam&#13;
and data on allocations, releases and expenditures for rural infrastructure. Figures should&#13;
be assembled to include latest expenditure information and would build upon the report&#13;
Viet Nam - Transport Sector- Serving an Economy in Transition Il 994). The study will&#13;
analyze these data to illustrate the overall patterns in supply and demand for rural&#13;
infrastructure. The statements prepared with this data will serve as the basis for analyzing&#13;
the service delivery and resource requirements for rural infrastructure.&#13;
6.    Aggregate levels of funding and infrastructure stocks will be compared to common&#13;
indicators such as GDP, income and employment; provincial and regional indicators will&#13;
also be contrasted and compared. The supply of rural infrastructure, in terms of resource&#13;
allocation, will be analyzed over time and space. Expenditure will be analyzed in terms of&#13;
their composition - e.g. rehabilitation, maintenance, new construction - and the level for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-                           Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
each item compared to estimates of global requirements (i.e. maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation).&#13;
7.    Budgeting preparation and execution practices for rural infrastructure at the&#13;
national, provincial and project specific level will be assessed from a review of current&#13;
practice in MOT and PDOTs as well as District and commune levels. This review could be&#13;
conducted with the assistance of local consultants who will assess the current&#13;
arrangements for implementing public expenditure decisions in the infrastructure sector.&#13;
8.    The quality of service delivery will be analyzed in relation to the standards of rural&#13;
infrastructure and service characteristics. This aspect of the study will be limited by the&#13;
relative paucity of information on detailed condition surveys of the existing rural&#13;
infrastructure stock and the difficulties associated with measuring quality of service (e.g.&#13;
rural transport). Local consultants may be engaged to collect additional data as necessary.&#13;
Also the study should recommend future strategies for addressing the paucity of&#13;
information and data and should consider the need for a more detailed travel and transport&#13;
survey and study, perhaps in the form of a research project for a post graduate candidate&#13;
sponsored through a fellowship or scholarship program.&#13;
9.    Once the analyses of resource allocation and financial resource mobilization are&#13;
completed a global estimate of resource requirements, by activity, can be prepared for&#13;
different scenarios. The scenarios would be prepared based on findings of the review of&#13;
the rural development strategy. Based on the global estimates of resource requirements for&#13;
each scenario considered, sub-sector specific recommendations would be prepared and a&#13;
rural infrastructure strategy will be developed. The strategy will present a position on&#13;
sectoral priorities and weigh the budgetary and institutional limitations identified. Existing&#13;
levels of funding and current trends will be compared with the estimated needs to&#13;
implement the rural infrastructure strategy.&#13;
10.   Key considerations of the Study in relation to the elements of the rural&#13;
infrastructure system will be:&#13;
(a)    The information base - including accurate base and inventory maps,&#13;
inventories of the stock and operational condition of a range of physical&#13;
facilities, including but not limited to transport infrastructure, and traffic&#13;
data;&#13;
(b)    Accessibility Planning - responding to such questions as who needs access&#13;
to what, for what reason or purpose, by what (likely) means of transport,&#13;
with what relative priority and with what prospective return or effect?;&#13;
(c)   Infrastructure Development and Maintenance - based on the results of&#13;
accessibility planning and taking into account such issues as appropriate&#13;
design and technology, construction standards, quality and longevity of&#13;
outputs, the modality and management of delivering those outputs and&#13;
maintenance standards; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-                              Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
(d)    Complementary Interventions - including a potentially wide range of&#13;
transport and non-transport activities geared to accelerating the response&#13;
to infrastructure development and to minimizing the travel and transport&#13;
burden among the target group as a whole.&#13;
11.   With sustained access, mobility and minimization of the travel and transport&#13;
burden as a major objective of the proposed strategy, it will be necessary to monitor the&#13;
rural transport system as a whole and to apply a management system to rural infrastructure&#13;
including maintenance management.&#13;
Risks&#13;
12.   The most significant risk faced by the proposed study is the fact that some cross-&#13;
sectoral issues- across various types of rural infrastructure would be only superficially&#13;
analyzed given the type of data presently available and expected to be collected by the&#13;
study. Efforts will be needed to focus on the themes across sub-sectors. A further risk will&#13;
arise from the inertia expected within existing institutions and agencies associated with&#13;
rural infrastructure as well as from existing professional staff, including engineers, who&#13;
may resist cooperation and collaboration if they feel their professional reputations under&#13;
threat when their past works and decisions are put under scrutiny as candidates for&#13;
modernization.&#13;
Output and Audience&#13;
13.   The study is expected to assist the Government and donors in planning for rural&#13;
infrastructure investments, operation and maintenance. Since the study is expected to&#13;
improve allocation of resources in rural infrastructure, provide the framework for future&#13;
rural infrastructure lending and identify a resource envelope, it will assist GovernmentO&#13;
current efforts to improve service delivery and address poverty issues in rural areas.&#13;
Specific outputs of the study will include a rural infrastructure strategy with specific&#13;
priorities, policy, institutional and financial reform recommendations. A draft Table of&#13;
Contents is attached.&#13;

Project Implementation Division (PID) within PMU18, Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communication; and (ii) provincial level in provinces under the Provincial Project&#13;
Management Unit (PPMU) under Provincial Department of Transportation (PDOTs). At&#13;
the central level, PID which would compromise of about 10 high level staff, would be&#13;
responsible for the overall management and coordination of project activities. At the&#13;
provincial level, PPMUs would be responsible for the day-to-day operational activities for&#13;
project implementation. Organization and staffing of PPMUs would be designed to adopt&#13;
implementation needs and would vary from 5 to 10 high level staff.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Rural
            Transport Project are to: a) improve and upgrade access to
            rural communities and link them to the district and
            provincial road networks; b) develop local capacity to
            improve the level of service of low-volume roads and to
            maintain them on a sustainable basis; and c) encourage the
            development of local contractors. To achieve the above
            objectives, the project will help finance the following main
            components: a) rural access road rehabilitation and
            maintenance using the spot improvement technique; b)
            institutional strengthening and training; and c) the study
            of issues relating to rural transport development.
