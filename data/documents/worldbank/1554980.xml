ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper uses the methodology earlier applied in the author's&#13;
"The Newly-Industrializing Developing Countries After the Oil Crisis" (World&#13;
Bank Staff Working Paper No. 437, October 1980) to examine the policy&#13;
experience of twelve less developed countries in the period following the&#13;
quadrupling of oil prices in 1973-74 and the world recession of 1974-75. The&#13;
group includes countries suffering adverse external shocks, countries where&#13;
these shocks were aggravated by internal shocks resulting from domestic&#13;
policies, as well as countries experiencing favorable external shocks.&#13;
The paper provides estimates of the balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
external shocks in the form of the deterioration of the terms of trade and&#13;
the slowdown of world export demand in the individual countries. It further&#13;
analyzes the policies applied and estimates the balance-of-payments effects&#13;
of policy choices in the form of additional net external financing, export&#13;
promotion, import substitution, and (temporarily) lowering the rate of&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
The results show export promotion to be positively, and import sub-&#13;
stitution negatively, correlated with the rate of economic growth in the period&#13;
1973-79. The results reflect the favorable experience of countries following&#13;
outward-oriented policies (Ivory Coast, Thailand, and Tunisia) and the high&#13;
cost of import substitution, in particular in countries experiencing internal&#13;
shocks in the form of increased government intervention in economic life,&#13;
higher protection, and reduced use of the market mechanism (Jamaica, Peru, and&#13;
Tanzania).&#13;
It further appears that,apart from Kenya and Thailand, countries&#13;
experiencing adverse external shocks relied on financing from abroad rather&#13;
than on domestic adjustment to cope with these shocks. Foreign borrowing was&#13;
increased also in countries that experienced favorable external shocks, whether&#13;
continuing or temporary, and the proceeds were used in large part to finance&#13;
high-cost, capital-intensive public investment, with adverse effects in economic&#13;
growth (in particular, in Morocco, Indonesia, and Nigeria).&#13;

THE POLICY EXPERIENCE OF TWELVE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, 1973-1979&#13;
Bela Balassa&#13;
I. Analyzing External Shocks and Policy Experience of&#13;
Less Developed Countries&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The non-OPEC developing countries suffered various external shocks after&#13;
1973. In the 1973-78 period, these shocks included the quadrupling of oil&#13;
prices, which took full effect in 1974, and the world recession of 1974-75,&#13;
which was followed by a relatively slow recovery. There were also pressures&#13;
for increased protection in the developed countries.&#13;
The quadrupling of oil prices adversely affected the balance of payments&#13;
of mDst non-OPEC developing countries. These effects were aggravated by the&#13;
deterioration of the non-oil terms of trade in the case of some of the&#13;
countries, and alleviated by improvements in the non-oil terms of trade in the&#13;
case of others. For several non-OPEC countries, in particular those exporting&#13;
cocoa and coffee, a net improvement in the terms of trade ensued, representing&#13;
a favorable external shock.&#13;
The slowdown in foreign demand for their exports, whether due to lower&#13;
rates of economic growth or increased protection abroad, had adverse effects&#13;
on the balance-of-payments of OPEC and non-OPEC developing countries alike.&#13;
These export volume effects varied from country to country, depending on the&#13;
composition of exports, since foreign demand for individual products and&#13;
product groups changed at different rates.&#13;
Developing countries, whose terms of trade effects and export volume&#13;
effects combined gave rise to a deterioration in the balance-of-payments,&#13;
adopted various policy measures to alleviate these adverse consequences.&#13;
Depending on the country concerned, the policy responses included increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
reliance on external financing, measures of export promotion and import&#13;
substitution, as well as macroeconomic policy measures affecting imports&#13;
indirectly through a decrease in the rate of economic activity. Developing&#13;
countries, where the net effects of external shocks on the balance of payments&#13;
were favorable, may in turn have curtailed reliance on external financing&#13;
(accumulated reserves), reduced efforts aimed at export promotion and import&#13;
substitution, or increased the rate of economic activity.&#13;
In this paper, estimates have been made on the balance-of-payments&#13;
effects of external shocks, and of policy responses to these shocks, in&#13;
twelve less developed countries that are in the range between the newly-&#13;
industrializing countries and the least developed countries. The paper will&#13;
also examine the effects of "internal shocks," which find their origin in&#13;
government policies. In the following, the analytical framework underlying&#13;
the estimates will be described and the principal characteristics of the&#13;
countries in question indicated. The Methodological Annex contains the&#13;
formulas used in the estimation.&#13;
External Shocks&#13;
The external shocks analyzed in the paper include changes in the terms of&#13;
trade and the slowdown of foreign demand for the exports of the less developed&#13;
countries. The balance-of-payments effects of these shocks have been&#13;
estimated by postulating a situation that would have existed in the absence of&#13;
external shocks.&#13;
Terms of trade effects have been derived as the difference between the&#13;
current price values of exports and imports and their constant price values,&#13;
calculated in the prices of the 1971-73 ("1972") base period. They have&#13;
further been decomposed into a pure terms of trade effect, estimated on the&#13;
assumption that the balance of trade, expressed in terms of "1972" prices, was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
in equilibrium, and an unbalanced trade effect, indicating the impact of the&#13;
rise of import prices on the deficit (surplus) in country's the balance of&#13;
trade, expressed in "1972" prices. This procedure reflects the assumption&#13;
that price increases since "1972" have been due to external shocks, in&#13;
particular the direct and indirect effects of the quadrupling of oil prices.&#13;
The balance-of-payments effects of the slowdown of foreign demand on the&#13;
exports of the less developed countries have been calculated as the difference&#13;
between the trend value of exports and hypothetical exports. The trend value&#13;
of exports has been derived on the assumption that the growth rate of foreign&#13;
demand for traditional export commoditiesl/ and for major product categories&#13;
remained the same as in the 1963-73 period and that the country concerned&#13;
maintained its *1972" share in these exports while hypothetical exports have&#13;
been estimated on the assumption that the country maintained its "1972" share&#13;
in actual world exports during the period under consideration. In the case of&#13;
manufactured goods, the effects of changes in foreign GNP growth rates and in&#13;
"apparent" foreign income elasticities of import demand, calculated as the&#13;
ratio of the rate of growth of imports to that of GNP, have further been&#13;
distinguished.&#13;
The Policies Applied&#13;
The paper considers policy responses to external shocks which involve&#13;
additional net external financing, export promotion, import substitution, and&#13;
lowering the rate of economic growth. The balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
these policies have again been estimated by postulating a situation that would&#13;
have occurred in the absence of external shocks.&#13;
1/ Defined as products that accounted for at least 1.5 percent of the&#13;
country's total exports in "1972".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Additional net external financing has been derived as the difference&#13;
between the actual trade balance and the trade balance that would have&#13;
obtained if trends in imports and exports observed in the 1963-73 period&#13;
continued and import and export prices remained at their "1972" level. Non-&#13;
factor services and private transfers do not enter into the calculation as&#13;
they are assumed to be unaffected by external shocks.&#13;
The effects of export promotion have been calculated as changes in&#13;
exports associated with increases in the country's "1972" export market&#13;
shares. In turn, import substitution has been defined as savings in imports&#13;
resulting from a fall in the income elasticity of import demand in the country&#13;
concerned. Finally, the effects on imports of changes in GNP growth rates as&#13;
compared to the 1963-73 period have been calculated on the assumption of&#13;
unchanged income elasticities of import demand in the importing country.&#13;
As noted above, domestic policy measures may also have been taken&#13;
independently of external shocks and may themselves constitute an "internal&#13;
shock." The methodology applied does not permit separating the balance-of-&#13;
payments effects of policy changes taken in response to external shocks from&#13;
the effects of autonomous policy changes. Correspondingly, the distinction&#13;
between the two necessarily becomes a matter of interpretation.&#13;
Country Classification&#13;
Table A provides comparative data on the twelve less developed countries&#13;
under study. These countries divide into four groups, depending on the&#13;
character of the external shocks they have experienced and the internal shocks&#13;
they may have suffered.&#13;
The first group includes three North African countries, all of which&#13;
showed an improvement in their "pure" terms of trade, calculated on the&#13;
assumption of balanced trade in "1972" prices, as a result of the rise in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prices of their petroleum (Egypt, Tunisia) or phosphate (Morocco, Tunisia)&#13;
exports. Nevertheless, these countries experienced substantial losses in&#13;
their terms of trade, as defined in this paper, on account of the unfavorable&#13;
effects of higher import prices on their trade deficit, expressed in "1972"&#13;
prices. At the same time, increased workers remittances and the rise in&#13;
service earnings, in particular tourism, offset much -- or all -- of the&#13;
adverse balance-of-payments effects of external shocks in the three countries.&#13;
There were no such offsetting factors in the second group of countries,&#13;
comprising Kenya, the Philippines and Thailand. And, in contrast to the first&#13;
group, import prices rose more rapidly than export prices in these countries,&#13;
thereby aggravating the adverse effects of higher import prices on their trade&#13;
deficit, expressed in "1972" prices.&#13;
The third group of countries, including Jamaica, Peru, and Tanzania,&#13;
experienced internal shocks that aggravated the effects of adverse external&#13;
shocks. In Jamaica, policy changes under the Manley government, in Peru the&#13;
military takeover, in Tanzania the Uhuru movement and related policies may be&#13;
considered as internal shocks that adversely affected domestic production and&#13;
exports.&#13;
The fourth group of countries, comprising Indonesia, the Ivory Coast, and&#13;
Nigeria, experienced favorable external shocks as improvements in the terms of&#13;
trade far exceeded the adverse export volume effects. In the two OPEC member&#13;
countries, Indonesia and Nigeria, increases in petroleum prices, in the Ivory&#13;
Coast the rise in cocoa and coffee prices explain the result.&#13;
II. The Balance-of-Payments Effects of External Shocks&#13;
In this section, empirical evidence will be provided on the balance-of-&#13;
payments effects of external shocks, in the form of terms of trade effects and&#13;
export volume effects, for the twelve less developed countries under study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
A comparative analysis of the relative importance of these sources of external&#13;
shocks will also be presented.&#13;
Table 1A reports the estimated terms of trade and export volume effects&#13;
for the years 1974 to 1978, taken individually, as well as averages for these&#13;
years, while Appendix Table 1 shows the average results for the 1974 to 1978&#13;
period in a disaggregated framework. Table 1B relates terms of trade effects&#13;
to the average of exports and imports (average trade) and to the gross&#13;
national product, and export volume effects to exports and to the gross&#13;
national product, all expressed in "1972" prices. Export volume effects are&#13;
shown in a four commodity group breakdown in Appendix Table 2.&#13;
Terms of Trade Effects&#13;
The first group of North African countries showed an improvement in their&#13;
pure" terms of trade throughout the period under consideration. This was&#13;
more than offset, however, by the adverse effects of higher import prices on&#13;
their trade deficit, expressed in "1972" prices, that was rising over time.&#13;
As a result, terms of trade effects increased from 1 percent of GNP in 1974'to&#13;
26 percent in 1978 in Egypt, from -4 percent to 8 percent in Morocco, and from&#13;
-4 percent to 10 percent in Tunisia. (Favorable terms of trade effects are&#13;
shown with a negative sign.)&#13;
The deterioration of the terms of trade also increasingly burdened the&#13;
balance of payments of the Philippines and Thailand, where both the pure terms;&#13;
of trade effect and the impact of higher import prices on the trade deficit,&#13;
measured in "1972" prices, were unfavorable. The resulting terms of trade&#13;
loss, expressed as a percentage of GNP, increased from 2 percent in 1974 to 8-&#13;
percent in 1978 in the Philippines and from 2 percent to 6 percent in&#13;
Thailand. In 1978, the pure terms of trade effect accounted for three-fifths&#13;
of the total terms of trade loss in the Philippines and for one-third of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
total in Thailand, reflecting a larger trade deficit in terms of "1972" prices&#13;
in the latter case.&#13;
Changes in the terms of trade showed considerable similarities in Kenya&#13;
and in Tanzania. Largely as a result of variations in coffee prices, both&#13;
countries experienced a deterioration in their pure terms of trade in 1974 and&#13;
1975, followed by improvements in 1976 and 1977, and a further deterioration&#13;
in 1978. With the effects of rising import prices on the trade deficit&#13;
decreasing in 1976, and rising again afterwards, the ratio of the terms of&#13;
trade loss to GNP fell from an average of 8 percent in 1974-75 to&#13;
approximately 1 percent in 1976-77 in both countries, giving place to .a loss&#13;
of 16 percent in Kenya and 14 percent in Tanzania in 1978 as coffee prices&#13;
declined.&#13;
Terms of trade effects also showed considerable fluctuations in Jamaica,&#13;
with the pure terms of trade effect deteriorating between 1974 and 1976, and&#13;
improving afterwards, largely as a result of variations in the prices of&#13;
bauxite and alumina. Correspondingly, after rising from 4 percent of GNP in&#13;
1974 to an average of 11 percent in 1975-76, Jamaica's terms of trade loss&#13;
declined again to 4 percent of GNP in 1977-78, on the average.&#13;
In conjunction with the decline in copper prices, the pure terms of trade&#13;
effect turned increasingly unfavorable in Peru. After 1975, however, this was&#13;
more than offset by reason of the improvement in the trade balance, expressed&#13;
in "1972" prices. As a result, of these influences, after a slight gain in&#13;
1974, the terms of trade loss reached a high of 7 percent of GNP in 1975 and&#13;
declined afterwards to 2 percent in 1978.&#13;
Among countries experiencing favorable external shocks, the terms of&#13;
trade gain varied between -11 percent and -18 percent of GNP during the period&#13;
under consideration in Indonesia, amounting to -17 percent in 1978. In turn,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
this gain declined from -22 percent in 1974 to -5 percent of GNP in 1978 in&#13;
Nigeria, largely because of the effects of higher import prices on its rising&#13;
trade deficit, expressed in "1972" prices. Finally, fluctuations in cocoa and&#13;
coffee prices explain changes over time in the Ivory Coast, with the terms of&#13;
trade gain amounting to -5 percent of GNP in 1974 and reaching double this&#13;
level in 1978.&#13;
Export Volume Effects&#13;
Except for a small gain in 1974 in Egypt, export volume effects were&#13;
unfavorable in all twelve less developed countries throughout the period under&#13;
consideration. The resulting export shortfall exhibited a steady upward trend&#13;
in the three North African countries and in the two countries of the Western&#13;
Hemisphere, from less than one percent of GNP in 1974 to 2 percent in 1978 in&#13;
Morocco, 3 percent in Peru, 4 percent in Egypt and in Tunisia, and 14 percent&#13;
in Jamaica. In the latter case, unfavorable trends in world demand for&#13;
bauxite and, in particular, alumina contributed to the observed result.&#13;
While the world exports of alumina rose at an average annual rate of 18&#13;
percent in the 1963-73 period, the increase was 6 percent a year afterwards.&#13;
Apart from Thailand, similar developments were observed in the other&#13;
countries studied, although the rebound from the world recession led to a&#13;
temporary improvement in 1976. The ratio of the export shortfall to GNP&#13;
reached 2 percent in Tanzania in 1978, 3 percent in Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria,&#13;
and the Philippines, and 4 percent in the Ivory Coast; it was approximately I&#13;
percent in the countries concerned in 1974.&#13;
Thailand provides a special case, inasmuch as the peak export shortfall,&#13;
amounting to 1 percent of GNP in 1975, was not again reached afterwards. The&#13;
relatively small export shortfall, and its decline after 1975, is explained by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
the rapid growth of world demand for maize, averaging 6 percent a year during&#13;
the period under consideration.&#13;
Terms of Trade Effects vs. Export Volume Effects&#13;
The results indicate the relative importance of terms of trade effects in&#13;
the oil-importing countries under study. In 1974, the ratio of the terms of&#13;
trade effects to export volume effects was especially high in Kenya (18),&#13;
Tanzania (16), Thailand (13), and Jamaica (8). With the slowdown in the rise&#13;
of petroleum prices and the increase in export shortfalls, the ratio declined&#13;
in subsequent years, although it increased again in 1978 in Kenya and in&#13;
Tanzania as coffee prices fell and it fluctuated to a considerable extent in&#13;
Thailand in response to variations in export shortfalls. The relevant results&#13;
for 1978 were 9 for Thailand, 6 for Kenya and Tanzania and practically nil in&#13;
Jamaica. In the latter case, the very large rise in the export shortfall was&#13;
responsible for the outcome.&#13;
In 1974, the ratio of terms of trade effects to export volume effects was&#13;
2 in the Philippines that benefited from high copper and vegetable oil&#13;
prices. In the same year, high copper prices led to a terms of trade gain in&#13;
Peru while such a result was due to high phosphate prices in Morocco and in&#13;
Tunisia. Finally, high petroleum prices reduced the terms of trade loss to&#13;
practically nil in Egypt that also enjoyed a small positive export volume&#13;
effect in 1974.&#13;
With the fall of copper prices, the ratio of terms of trade effects to&#13;
export volume effects rose to 4 in 1975 in Peru, but subsequently declined to&#13;
1-by 1978. A similar pattern was observed in the Philippines, where the ratio&#13;
reached a peak of 7 in 1976 and decreased to 3 in 1978. In turn, due largely&#13;
to the impact of increased import prices on their rising trade deficit in&#13;
terms of "1972" prices, the ratio of terms of trade effects to import volume&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
effects rose to 4 in 1978 in Morocco, 7 in Egypt, and 3 in Tunisia,&#13;
notwithstanding the fact that the latter two countries enjoyed an increased&#13;
export surplus in petroleum.&#13;
In indicating the relative importance of terms of trade effects in the&#13;
oil-importing countries, the findings conflict with the conventional view that&#13;
gives emphasis to the unfavorable effects of the world recession and the&#13;
subsequent slow recovery in the developed countries on the balance of payments&#13;
of the developing countries. Nor do the results support the view that&#13;
increased protectionism in the developed countries would have adversely&#13;
affected the exports of manufactured goods from the developing countries.&#13;
Thus, the data show an increase in the "apparent" income elasticity of&#13;
import demand in the developed countries for manufactured goods originating in&#13;
the developing countries between the pre-1973 and the post-1973 periods. This&#13;
increase in the income elasticity of import demand offset about one-fifth of&#13;
the export shortfall due to the slowdown of economic growth in the developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
In intra-LDCs trade, the favorable effects of high GNP growth rates and&#13;
income elasticity of demand reinforced each other, with beneficial effects for&#13;
countries, such as Egypt and the Ivory Coast, for whose manufactured exports&#13;
the markets of other developing countries represent important outlets. In the&#13;
case of Egypt, however, these favorable effects were far outweighed by the&#13;
joint impact of lower GNP growth rates and the decline in the income&#13;
elasticity of demand for manufactured goods originating in the developing&#13;
countries on the part of centrally planned economies that provided markets for&#13;
two-thirds of Egypt's manufactured exports in the early seventies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. The Policies Applied and their Balance of Payments Effects&#13;
Section II of the paper examined the impact of external shocks, in the&#13;
form of terms of trade and export volume effects, on the balance of payments&#13;
of twelve less developed countries, classified in four groups. Section III&#13;
will analyze the policies employed by the individual countries and indicate&#13;
their balance-of-payments effects. Unless otherwise noted, the estimates&#13;
pertain to the year 1978.&#13;
Table 1A shows the balance-of-payments effects of the policies applied&#13;
while Table 1B relates the results to the volume of exports, imports, average&#13;
trade and the gross national product, as the case may be, all expressed in&#13;
"1972" prices. More detailed estimates are shown in Appendix Tables 1 and&#13;
2. In turn, Table 2 provides information on the financing of the resource&#13;
gap, Table 3 on nominal and real interest rates, the government budget, and&#13;
the money supply, Table 4 on nominal and real exchange rates vis-a-vis the&#13;
U.S. dollar, Table 5 on debt service and the external debt ratios, and Table 6&#13;
on expenditure shares, incremental capital-output ratios, and rates of&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia&#13;
In 1974, the combined balance-of-payments effects of external shocks&#13;
equalled 1 percent of the gross national product in Egypt, -3 percent in&#13;
Morocco, and -4 percent in Tunisia. The effects of these shocks turned&#13;
unfavorable in 1975 in Morocco and Tunisia, and increased further in&#13;
subsequent years in all three countries. By 1978, their ratio to GNP was 29&#13;
percent in Egypt, 10 percent in Morocco, and 14 percent in Tunisia.&#13;
Increased toll revenue from the Suez Canal, tourist receipts, and&#13;
workers remittances outweighed the adverse balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
external shocks in Egypt. But, additional net external financing was more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
than double the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks as the adverse&#13;
impact of negative import substitution and losses in export market shares was&#13;
offset only in small part by import savings associated with changes in GNP&#13;
growth rates. The latter result represented a combination of the acceleration&#13;
of economic growth and the negative income elasticity of import demand&#13;
observed in the 1963-73 period.&#13;
The negative income elasticity of import demand in 1963-73 had its origin&#13;
in Egypt's foreign exchange shortage during the period that led to an absolute&#13;
decline in the volume of imports. In turn, negative import substitution after&#13;
1973 reflected the increased availability of foreign exchange, the rapidly&#13;
growing need for imported food, and the high import content of rising&#13;
investment. Import liberalization had less of an influence as competing&#13;
imports continued to be practically excluded in Egypt.&#13;
On the export side, large losses in market shares in Egypt's traditional&#13;
export products and in its manufactured exports were-not compensated by the&#13;
small gains obtained in fuels and in nontraditional primary exports (mainly&#13;
potatoes and onions), so that Egypt suffered a one-third loss in its average&#13;
export market shares. Among traditional primary exports, Egypt's market share&#13;
declined by seven-tenths in the case of rice, by one-half in the case of&#13;
cotton, and by one-fourth in the case of citrus fruit.&#13;
In the same period, Egypt's market share in manufactured exports fell by&#13;
one-fourth. A one-tenth loss in export shares occurred in the centrally&#13;
planned economies, which traditionally took two-thirds of Egypt's manufactured&#13;
exports, losses by one-half were experienced in developing country markets,&#13;
reflecting largely political changes in the Middle East, and a decline by one-&#13;
fifth was observed in developed country markets, reflecting the increased&#13;
overvaluation of the currency. At the same time, with the unification of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
exchange rate system, the figures cited in Table 4 understate the appreciation&#13;
of the real exchange rate after 1973.&#13;
But, Egypt improved its savings performance with the share of domestic&#13;
savings in GNP reaching 20 percent towards the end of the period as compared&#13;
to 10 percent in 1963-73. Also, the share of gross domestic investment in&#13;
aggregate expenditure rose from 14 percent in 1963-73 to 20 percent in 1974-&#13;
76, and to 24 percent in 1977-79. As incremental capital-output ratios first&#13;
declined and subsequently increased again, the rate of growth of GNP doubled&#13;
in the 1973-76 period and rose slightly afterwards.&#13;
Apart from domestic savings, the high rate of investment was financed by&#13;
continued foreign borrowing. As a result, the ratio of Egypt's gross external&#13;
debt to GNP increased from 48 percent in 1973 to 70 percent in 1978. Given&#13;
Egypt's poor export performance, the rise in its gross debt service ratio (the&#13;
ratio of interest payments and amortization to export value) was even greater,&#13;
from 24 percent in 1973 to 83 percent in 1978.&#13;
In Morocco, earnings from tourism and, in particular, workers&#13;
remittances increased to a considerable extent, offsetting much of the adverse&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of external shocks. However, additional net&#13;
external financing was one-half larger than the balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
external shocks. This result reflected the combined effects of losses in&#13;
export market shares, negative import substitution, and rising imports&#13;
associated with the acceleration of economic growth.&#13;
Morocco experienced losses in market shares in every major export&#13;
commodity other than phosphates and fuels, as well as in nontraditional&#13;
primary products and in manufactured goods. These losses rose over time as&#13;
the Moroccan currency became increasingly overvalued, reaching one-fifth of&#13;
total exports in 1978. The effects of the appreciation of the real exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
rate, increased food imports made necessary by the poor performance of&#13;
agriculture, and the high import content of investment further gave rise to&#13;
negative import substitution in Morocco.&#13;
The share of gross fixed investment in aggregate expenditure increased&#13;
from 13 percent in 1963-73 to 20 percent in 1974-76 and to 23 percent in 1976-&#13;
78. However, following a decline in 1974-76, the incremental capital-output&#13;
ratio rose more than threefold as large investment projects of questionable&#13;
efficiency were undertaken. The resulting fall in the rate of economic growth&#13;
was aggravated by the deflationary policies adopted in 1978, in response to&#13;
the international liquidity problems created by Morocco's increased&#13;
indebtedness. Thus, after rising from 4.5 percent a year in 1963-73 to 9.3&#13;
percent in 1973-76, the average annual rate of growth of GNP fell to 3.5&#13;
percent in 1976-t9.&#13;
The increase in the rate of investment was largely financed by the inflow&#13;
of foreign capital as the domestic savings ratio remained at about 15&#13;
percent. Rising interest payments and amortization of the debt, in turn,&#13;
raised Morocco's debt service ratio, necessitating further foreign&#13;
borrowing. By 1978, the gross debt service ratio reached 32 percent and the&#13;
ratio of gross external debt to GNP 39 percent; the corresponding ratios were&#13;
13 percent and 18 percent, respectively, in 1973.&#13;
Morocco's increased indebtedness reflected the effects of expansionary&#13;
policies followed in the wake of increases in phosphate prices that, however,&#13;
remained temporary. These policies adversely affected the longer-term&#13;
perspectives of the economy, both through the inappropriate choice of some&#13;
large investments and the increased foreign indebtedness that necessitated a&#13;
retrenchment which may last for several years. The situation was aggravated&#13;
by the war in the Sahara.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

While Tunisia had the same experience with phosphate prices as Morocco,&#13;
given its higher trade share, the deterioration of the terms of trade&#13;
represented a somewhat higher proportion of its GNP.    Tunisia also suffered a&#13;
larger export shortfall than Morocco, due chiefly to EEC restrictions on the&#13;
importation of olive oil, its principal export. Finally, increases in&#13;
tourist receipts and workers' remittances offset a smaller part of the adverse&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of external shocks than in Morocco.&#13;
Nevertheless, Tunisia avoided excessive foreign indebtedness, and hence&#13;
it did not have to interrupt its growth process.   The ratio of gross external&#13;
debt to GNP increased only from 32 percent in 1973 to 44 percent in 1978 while&#13;
the debt service ratio declined from 30 percent in 1973 to 24 percent in 1978&#13;
(the results are somewhat less favorable if the ratios are calculated in net&#13;
terms by adjusting for reserve changes in the first case and for interest&#13;
receipts in the second).&#13;
These results are explained in part by Tunisia's successful savings&#13;
effort, with domestic savings reaching one-fifth of GDP as against 15 percent&#13;
in Morocco. Differences in savings ratios, in turn, may be explained by&#13;
differences in real interest rates and in the government budget deficit.&#13;
Apart from a slightly negative figure in 1977, Tunisia maintained positive&#13;
real interest rates after 1974 whereas real interest rates were consistently&#13;
negative in Morocco. Furthermore, the deficit in the government budget&#13;
remained below 5 percent of the gross national product in Tunisia while it&#13;
surpassed 15 percent in both 1976 and 1977 in Morocco, representing a&#13;
substantial increase as compared to the 4 percent figure in 1974. In 1978,&#13;
the budget deficit equalled 3 percent of GNP in Tunisia and 11 percent in&#13;
Morocco.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Also, high-cost, capital-intensive investments were much less prevalent&#13;
in Tunisia than in Morocco, so that its incremental capital-output ratio rose&#13;
to a lesser extent. With investment shares rising from 22 percent in 1963-73&#13;
to 26 percent in 1973-79, Tunisia's GNP rate growth was 7.4 percent in the&#13;
latter period as compared to 6.1 percent in the former.&#13;
In contrast to both Egypt and Morocco, Tunisia was also successful in&#13;
increasing its export market shares as it provided greater incentives to&#13;
exports and maintained the real exchange rate approximately constant.&#13;
Increases in manufactured exports (in particular, textiles) were quite&#13;
spectacular, with Tunisia doubling its market share, while there was little&#13;
change, on balance, in regard to primary exports. But, like the other two&#13;
North African countries, Tunisia experienced negative import substitution, due&#13;
largely to higher food imports and the import requirements of increased&#13;
investment; its imports increased further as a result of the acceleration of&#13;
the rate of economic growth.&#13;
Kenya, Philippines, Thailand&#13;
In 1974, the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks equalled 10&#13;
percent of the gross national product in Kenya, 2 percent in Thailand, and 3&#13;
percent in the Philippines. In Kenya, the ratio fell to 1 percent in 1976 as&#13;
coffee prices increased, but it rose again to 18 percent in 1978 as coffee&#13;
prices declined. In turn, the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks&#13;
increased more or less continuously in the Philippines and in Thailand,&#13;
reaching 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in 1978.&#13;
In Kenya, additional net external financing was consistently smaller than&#13;
the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks, reflecting the reliance&#13;
placed on domestic measures of adjustment. In contrast with the three North&#13;
African countries, which exhibited negative import substitution and increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
imports in response to higher growth rates, Kenya saved foreign exchange&#13;
through import substitution, as well as through a modest reduction in the rate&#13;
of economic growth in the years immediately, following the oil crisis.&#13;
Part of the reduction in import shares was due to the disintegration of&#13;
the East African Community. For the same reason, Kenya experienced a decline&#13;
in its market shares in nontraditional primary and manufactured exports.&#13;
Excluding trade with Tanzania and Uganda, there was a gain in export market&#13;
shares in these commodities. Kenya also increased its market shares in most&#13;
traditional exports that are sold largely outside East Africa.&#13;
Tncreases in export market shares reflect the effects of the introduction&#13;
of a 10 percent export subsidy to nontraditional exports and the alignment of&#13;
agricultural prices to world market price relationships following the oil&#13;
crisis and the world recession. While import protection increased also with&#13;
the extension of the scope of Letters of No Objection privileges which gave&#13;
firms effective veto power over the imports of competing products. Kenya&#13;
continued to maintain a relatively outward-oriented stance among developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
Changes in the system of incentives, introduced in 1979, represented&#13;
further steps towards outward orientation. These changes included the&#13;
replacement of quantitative restrictions by tariffs, the elimination of&#13;
Letters of No Objection privileges, and increases in export subsidies to&#13;
nontraditional exports from 10 percent to 20 percent. The effects of these&#13;
measures were mitigated, however, by increases in tariffs.&#13;
Apart from the expansionary policies followed in the years of high coffee&#13;
prices, the monetary and fiscal measures applied in Kenya were generally in&#13;
line with the needs of the national economy and excessive forelgn borrowing&#13;
was avoided. As a result, the ratio of gross external debt to GNP increased&#13;

only from 19 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1978. And while larger&#13;
increases are shown in the net external debt ratio as Kenya was drawing down&#13;
reserves, both gross and net debt service ratios fell to a considerable&#13;
extent.&#13;
In avoiding high-cost investment projects, Kenya was able to reduce the&#13;
incremental capital-output ratio from 3.8 in 1970-73 to 3.4 in 1973-76 and 3.2&#13;
in 1976-79, although the 1963-73 ratio of 2.6 was not again reached. With&#13;
domestic savings ratios rising above 20 percent of GNP, economic growth&#13;
accelerated after 1976, attaining the 6.5 percent GNP growth rate observed in&#13;
the 1963-73 period.&#13;
The Philippines and Thailand, two East Asian countries with similar per&#13;
capita incomes and export composition, showed considerable differences in&#13;
policy performance in the post-1973 period. Whereas in the Philippines&#13;
additional net external borrowing exceeded the balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
external shocks, in Thailand domestic policy measures carried the brunt of the&#13;
adjustment and additional net external financing remained at low levels.&#13;
Thailand experienced considerable increases in export market shares,&#13;
import substitution, and, until 1977, savings in imports associated with a&#13;
slight deceleration in the rate of economic growth as compared to the 1963-73&#13;
period. Increases in export shares were smaller in the Philippines, which&#13;
exhibited negative import substitution and increases in imports due to a&#13;
slight acceleration in the rate of economic growth.&#13;
Thailand increased market shares in its traditional exports by one-third,&#13;
on the average, with gains shown in sugar, crustaceans and molluscs, tin, and&#13;
rubber, and losses in rice, maize, and jute. But the largest increase&#13;
occurred in tapioca that is classified among nontraditional primary exports&#13;
due to the lack of comparable world market figures. The exports of tapioca&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
rose fourfold during the period under consideration, accounting for 12 percent&#13;
of Thailand-s total exports by 1978. Manufactured exports also increased&#13;
rapidly, with Thailand's market share rising by nearly one-half.&#13;
These changes occurred in the framework of a relatively open economy;&#13;
there was little discrimination against exports, the exception being rice that&#13;
was subject to tax. The openness of the economy also led to relatively&#13;
efficient import substitution and to a decline in incremental capital-output&#13;
ratios. With increases in the rate of investment following the granting of&#13;
investment incentives, the GNP growth rates of the 1963-73 period were&#13;
surpassed after 1975, and the average for the 1973-79 period (7.6 percent) was&#13;
only slightly below that for 1963-73 (7.7 percent).&#13;
Thailand's balance of payments was adversely affected, however, by the&#13;
decline in earnings from the Vietnam war and from private transfers,&#13;
necessitating increased reliance on foreign borrowing. As a result, the ratio&#13;
of gross external debt to GNP rose from 7 percent in 1973 to 11 percent in&#13;
1978, and the gross debt service ratio increased from 21 percent to 29&#13;
percent.&#13;
The Philippines lost market shares in its traditional exports as declines&#13;
in sawn logs, sugar, copra, and copper ores were not compensated by increases&#13;
in edible nuts and coconut oil. However, it gained market shares in&#13;
nontraditional primary exports, due to increases in the exports of bananas,&#13;
canned pineapple, iron ore, and silver. Finally, it experienced a rise of&#13;
export shares in manufactured goods by about one-third.&#13;
On the average, export market shares increased by one-tenth in the&#13;
Philippines as compared to a one-third rise in Thailand. Smaller export&#13;
increases may be explained by higher industrial protection in the Philippines&#13;
that biased the system of incentives against exports. And, increases in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
manufactured exports were even smaller in net terms as much of the increase&#13;
was concentrated in export processing zones where domestic value added is low.&#13;
High levels of protection notwithstanding, the Philippines experienced&#13;
negative import substitution. This may be explained by the imported input&#13;
needs of import substituting industries and of export production, the high&#13;
import content of rising investment, and the increase in imports associated&#13;
with the appreciation of the real exchange rate to an extent much exceeding&#13;
that of Thailand.&#13;
The rising cost of domestic production behind high protection also raised&#13;
incremental capital-output ratios in the Philippines. While these ratios were&#13;
only one-tenth higher in the Philippines than in Thailand in 1963-73, the&#13;
difference in the ratios averaged one-fifth in 1973-79 and it reached two-&#13;
fifths by the end of the period.    Despite its higher investment share, the&#13;
average annual rate of growth of GNP was nearly one-fourth lower in the&#13;
Philippines than in Thailand in the 1973-79 period.&#13;
At the same time with domestic savings accounting for about 25 percent of&#13;
GNP in both countries, its higher investment share necessitated greater&#13;
reliance on foreign borrowing in the Philippines. Correspondingly, its gross&#13;
external debt ratio increased from 16 percent to 28 percent and the gross debt&#13;
service ratio from 23 percent to 42 percent between 1973 and 1978.&#13;
Jamaica, Peru, Tanzania&#13;
Given the importance of coffee in its exports, the pattern of the&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of external shocks in Tanzania was broadly similar&#13;
to that in Kenya, declining from 7 percent of GNP in 1974 to 3 percent in&#13;
1976, and rising again to 17 percent in 1978. In turn, with some variations&#13;
due to the world business cycle, the balance-of-payments effects of external&#13;
shocks increased from 4 percent of GNP in 1974 to 19 percent in 1978 in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Jamaica, where the rising export shortfall in bauxite and alumina was only&#13;
partially compensated by improvements in the terms of trade after 1974.&#13;
Finally, largely due to changes in copper prices, the balance-of-payments&#13;
effects of external shocks rose from nil in 1974 to 9 percent of GNP in 1975&#13;
and declined to 6 percent by 1978 in Peru.&#13;
The adverse effects of external shocks in the three countries were&#13;
aggravated by internal shocks resulting from government policies that gave&#13;
rise to considerable economic dislocation. In all three countries, the impact&#13;
of internal shocks was most apparent in the decline of domestic savings ratios&#13;
and export market shares.&#13;
In Jamaica, the share of domestic savings in GNP fell from about 25&#13;
percent prior to the installation of the Manley government in 1972 to 10&#13;
percent in 1976-77, followed by an increase to 16 percent in 1978 which proved&#13;
to be temporary. Increased government intervention in economic life, the&#13;
widespread application of quantitative import restrictions, and the decline of&#13;
confidence on the part of domestic and foreign investors all contributed to&#13;
this result.&#13;
While favorable changes in the terms of trade aided economic activity in&#13;
Peru until 1974, the chaotic management of state enterprises, the&#13;
overvaluation of the currency, increased protection, and political and&#13;
economic uncertainty under the military regime of General Velasco created&#13;
increasing economic difficulties. These were reflected in the fall in the&#13;
domestic savings ratio from 16 percent in 1970-71 to 11 percent in 1974-75.&#13;
Little immediate improvement occurred following the installation of the&#13;
government of General Bermudez in 1975, but savings ratios increased to 17&#13;
percent in 1978 and 24 percent in 1979 in the wake of the May 1978 policy&#13;
package that included a large devaluation, the adoption of the crawling peg,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
as well as restraint on government spending.&#13;
In Tanzania, the Arusha declaration of 1967 called for increasing&#13;
government intervention in economic life and for reorganizing agriculture.&#13;
The Ujama village movement was launched shortly thereafter, but the&#13;
acceleration of the villagization program began only in 1974. These&#13;
developments, together with the expanded role of the government in conjunction&#13;
with the 1972 reorganization of the public sector and the establishment of new&#13;
parastatals, adversely affected savings in Tanzania. The domestic savings&#13;
ratio declined from 17 percent in the early seventies to 9 percent in 1974-75&#13;
and 7 percent in 1978-79, with a temporary increase to 16 percent at the time&#13;
of high coffee prices in 1976-77.&#13;
The three countries experiencing internal policy shocks also suffered a&#13;
considerable decline in their export market shares. With increased import&#13;
protection and the reduced use of price incentives, Jamaica's market share&#13;
fell by 56 percent, on the average, while Tanzania experienced a decline of 44&#13;
percent, only part of which is explained by the disintegration of the East&#13;
African Community. In turn, a decrease by 23 percent in 1976 gave place to a&#13;
gain of 11 percent in 1978 in Peru, due to the rise of manufactured exports in&#13;
response to policy changes and, to a lesser extent, increased exports of&#13;
petroleum.&#13;
In Jamaica, declines in market shares were shown for all traditional&#13;
export products as well as for all major commodity groups. Shortcomings in&#13;
the management of the publicly-owned Banana Company, the poor performance of&#13;
the newly-established sugar cooperatives, and the adverse reactions of foreign&#13;
companies to the 15 percent tax imposed on bauxite in 1974 led to losses in&#13;
market shares amounting to 45 percent in bananas and 27 percent in sugar,&#13;
bauxite and alumina in 1978.   In the same year, Jamaica experienced losses in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
market shares of 75 percent in nontraditional primary exports and 60 percent&#13;
in manufactured exports. In the latter commodity group, losses were even&#13;
larger in developed country markets as the establishment of CARICOM led to a&#13;
shift of exports to the partner countries. In response to increased political&#13;
uncertainty, the growth of tourist earnings also slowed down and workers&#13;
remittances declined in absolute terms.&#13;
Losses in export market shares amounted to 10 percent of Jamaica's GNP,&#13;
and equalled one-half of the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks.&#13;
Furthermore, while the data appear to indicate the existence of considerable&#13;
import substitution, reductions in import shares were not associated with the&#13;
expansion of domestic production. Rather, output declined as losses in export&#13;
earnings, together with increased difficulties encountered in borrowing&#13;
abroad, gave rise to foreign exchange shortages in Jamaica.&#13;
The decline of domestic output began in 1974 and continued every year&#13;
thereafter. GNP fell 4.8 percent a year, on the average, between 1973 and&#13;
1976 and 1.8 percent a year between 1976 and 1979 as against a rate of growth&#13;
of 5.7 percent in the 1963-73 period and 5.9 percent between 1970 and 1973.&#13;
Apart from increasing economic inefficiencies, the decline in the share of&#13;
gross domestic investment in GDP from 28 percent in 1971-73 to 21 percent in&#13;
1974-76 and to 13 percent in 1977-79 contributed to this outcome.&#13;
Until the lack of creditworthiness practically eliminated foreign&#13;
borrowing, the fall of the investment rate was slowed by the inflow of foreign&#13;
capital, which was relied upon to alleviate the adverse balance-of-payments&#13;
effects of external shocks and of losses in export market shares. As a&#13;
result, Jamaica's gross debt service ratio rose from 11 percent in 1973 to 22&#13;
percent in 1976 while the ratio of gross external debt to GNP increased from&#13;
18 percent to 43 percent. With the need to finance amortization and interest&#13;

payments, the gross debt service ratio rose further to 27 percent, and the&#13;
gross external debt ratio to 47 percent, in 1978. Increases were even larger&#13;
in the net external debt ratio, from 13 percent in 1973 to 51 percent in 1978,&#13;
as Jamaica had a negative reserve position in the latter year.&#13;
Tanzania experienced a 13 percent average loss in market shares in its&#13;
traditional exports as large declines in the exports of cotton and vegetable&#13;
oil by-products were only partially compensated by increased market shares in&#13;
coffee, tea, and sisal. Tanzania also had a loss of 47 percent in its market&#13;
share in nontraditional primary exports and 64 percent in manufactured&#13;
exports.&#13;
Losses in market shares in agricultural exports in part reflected the&#13;
poor performance of agriculture. Moreover, the increased overvaluation of the&#13;
exchange rate and reduced reliance on price signals adversely affected primary&#13;
as well as manufactured exports, the exception being the tree crops where the&#13;
production period is 8 to 10 years. Inefficiencies of resource allocation&#13;
further led to a one-third rise in incremental capital-output ratios as&#13;
compared to the 1963-73 period.&#13;
If Tanzania did not reach the state of virtual bankruptcy as Jamaica did,&#13;
the explanation lies in the increasing inflow of foreign capital that&#13;
reached 14 percent of GDP in 1978. As practically all of the inflow was on&#13;
concessional terms, or in the form of outright grants, Tanzania's gross debt&#13;
service ratio declined from 15 percent in 1973 to 7 percent in 1975-77,&#13;
although it increased again to 16 percent in 1978. In turn, the ratio of&#13;
gross external debt to GNP rose from 22 percent in 1973 to 28 percent in 1978,&#13;
with a rise from 15 percent to 28 percent in the net external debt ratio as&#13;
Tanzania used up its foreign exchange reserves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The inflow of funds from abroad permitted maintaining GNP growth rates at&#13;
4 to 5 percent a year in Tanzania, notwithstanding the decline in domestic&#13;
savings and the rise of incremental capital-output ratios. These figures&#13;
however, reflect to a considerable extent the increased absorption of&#13;
resources by the public sector, with public administration and defense growing&#13;
by 9.2 percent a year between 1973 and 1979. Furthermore, the 6.1 percent&#13;
reported growth rate for agriculture conflicts with data for the individual&#13;
crops. At the same time, as in the case of Jamaica, Tanzania's foreign&#13;
exchange difficulties largely explained the decline of import shares in GNP.&#13;
As noted above, losses in export market shares until 1976 were followed&#13;
by gains in 1978 in Peru. The largest gain occurred in copper exports as the&#13;
stabilization of political conditions permitted the exploitation of Peru's&#13;
favorable resource endowment. Increases were further shown in manufactured&#13;
exports, due in part to exports to partner countries in the Andean group and&#13;
in part to the depreciation of the real exchange rate.&#13;
Increases were experienced also in petroleum and, to a lesser extent, in&#13;
coffee, lead ore, and nontraditional primary exports (chiefly mining products)&#13;
whereas a substantial decline occurred in the exports of iron ore, fish meal,&#13;
sugar and cotton. While natural factors were predominant in the case of fish&#13;
meal, the fall in the exports of cotton and sugar reflected the poor&#13;
performance of Peruvian agriculture, with production rising at a lower rate&#13;
than population. Various influences contributed to this result, including the&#13;
poor management of the cooperatives created after the agrarian reform, the&#13;
system of quotas imposed on the use of land for producing various crops, and&#13;
the nationalization of the marketing of agricultural products.&#13;
With the dislocation of production under General Velasco's reign leading&#13;
to losses in export market shares and to negative import substitution, Peru&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

incurred substantial foreign debts. The gross external debt ratio rose from&#13;
36 percent in 1973 to 48 percent in 1976 and the gross debt service ratio from&#13;
47 percent -- itself representing a considerable increase over earlier years&#13;
-- to 60 percent. Further increases in these ratios occurred in subsequent&#13;
years as the government of General Bermudez, installed in 1975, continued with&#13;
the expansionary policies of its predecessor for a time. The application of&#13;
the May 1978 policy package, in turn, led to a decline in GNP but, with rising&#13;
amortization and interest payments, the debt situation improved only after&#13;
1978.&#13;
Indonesia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast&#13;
As a result of the quadrupling of petroleum prices, Indonesia and Nigeria&#13;
experienced favorable external shocks in 1974, the balance-of-payments effects&#13;
of which equalled -15 percent and -22 percent of GNP in the two countries,&#13;
respectively. Following some fluctuations associated with changes in the real&#13;
price of petroleum, these effects regained approximately their 1974 level in&#13;
1978 in Indonesia but declined to -2 percent in Nigeria that experienced a&#13;
rising trade deficit in terms of "1972- prices. Finally, in the Ivory Coast,&#13;
the favorable balance-of-payments effects of external shocks equalled -3&#13;
percent of GNP in 1974 and -6 percent in 1978, with variations in the&#13;
intervening years resulting from fluctuations in cocoa and coffee prices.&#13;
Indonesia further experienced a 45 percent increase in its average export&#13;
market share, with the growth of fuel exports accounting for one-half of the&#13;
total. Starting from a small base, Indonesia-s market share in manufactured&#13;
exports rose by three-quarters as increases in exports to its ASEAN partners&#13;
more than offset losses in developed country markets.&#13;
Indonesia's market shares in its traditional exports (other than fuels)&#13;
increased by one-half, on the average, during the period under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

consideration. Export shares more than doubled in the case of coffee and tin,&#13;
rose by one-third for nonconiferous wood and by one-sixth for palm oil,&#13;
remained unchanged for natural rubber, and fell by one-half in the case of&#13;
crustaceans and mollusks. Indonesia also increased its market shares in&#13;
nontraditional primary exports, with export growth experienced in a variety of&#13;
products.&#13;
Exports rose, notwithstanding the decline in the real exchange rate that&#13;
continued until the 34 percent devaluation in November 1978. Favorable&#13;
developments in exports may reflect the supply-enhancing effects of&#13;
investments in the pre-1973 (coffee, tea) and the post-1973 (petroleum and&#13;
nontraditional primary and manufactured activities) periods. At the same&#13;
time, the import needs of increased investment activity, with the share of&#13;
investment in aggregate expenditure rising from 11 percent in 1963-73 to 21&#13;
percent in 1973-78, contributed to negative import substitution that was&#13;
further aggravated by the appreciation of the real exchange rate.&#13;
A substantial proportion of new investment was oriented towards highly&#13;
capital-intensive projects of often doubtful efficiency, undertaken or&#13;
sponsored by the public sector. High-cost public investments, as well as the&#13;
adverse effects of increased import, investment, and credit controls of the&#13;
private sector, led to a rise in the incremental capital-output ratio from 1.8&#13;
in 1963-73 to 2.7 in 1973-78. As a result, increases in investment shares,&#13;
financed largely from rising oil revenue, were not translated into higher&#13;
rates of economic growth. In fact, a slight decline in GNP growth rates&#13;
occurred after 1973, giving rise to some import savings.&#13;
These savings in imports, together with increases in export market&#13;
shares, exceeded the balance-of-payments impact of negative import&#13;
substitution, thereby reinforcing the favorable effects of external shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Correspondingly, additional net external financing became increasingly&#13;
negative in Indonesia. This was nearly offset, however, by the rise in non-&#13;
factor service payments that include the growing discrepancy in trade figures&#13;
between trade and balance-of-payments statistics. While in "1972" the&#13;
reported trade surplus was $0.3 billion larger in the trade statistics than in&#13;
the balance-of-payments accounts, the difference reached $3.3 billion by&#13;
1978. To the extent that the discrepancy reflects unreported imports,&#13;
negative import substitution and favorable trends in additional net external&#13;
financing are overstated.&#13;
Actual net external financing was $-1.8 billion in 1974 in Indonesia,&#13;
declined to $-0.2 billion in 1975 and in 1976, increased again to $-1.6&#13;
billion in 1977, and fell to $-0.6 billion in 1978. The 1975-76 decline&#13;
reflected substantial increases in imports for capital intensive projects,&#13;
undertaken in large part by Pertamina, that was reversed in 1977 but imports&#13;
rose again in 1978.&#13;
Dividend payments to oil companies, representing a counterpart to&#13;
petroleum exports, increased from $0.6 billion in 1973 to $1.3 billion in 1974&#13;
and to $1.9 billion in 1978. Adjusted for dividend payments, Indonesia had&#13;
net external financing requirements of about $1.0 billion in 1975-76. This&#13;
fell to practically zero at the time of relative austerity in 1977 but rose to&#13;
$1.5 billion in 1978, motivating the November 1978 devaluation.&#13;
In 1975-76, financing took the form of drawing down reserves and&#13;
borrowing abroad. After a decline in 1977, foreign borrowing increased again&#13;
in 1978, in part to finance amortization and interest on debt contracted&#13;
earlier and in part to cover the balance-of-payments deficit. Nevertheless,&#13;
with increasing exports and GNP, debt service and external debt ratios&#13;
remained low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Nigeria lost export market shares as a result of the increased&#13;
overvaluation of the exchange rate and the strong pro-urban bias in the wake&#13;
of the quadrupling of petroleum prices, which adversely affected agricultural&#13;
production and exports. Agricultural output did not regain the 1970-71 level&#13;
until 1979 and groundnut exports fell to zero. With Nigeria maintaining its&#13;
export market share in cocoa and experiencing a decline to one-fifth in regard&#13;
to tin, it had a one-third loss in its average market share in traditional&#13;
primary exports. Losses were even larger in nontraditional primary exports&#13;
(44 percent) while a decrease of 7 percent was shown for fuels. Finally, the&#13;
overvaluation of the exchange rate and the increased absorption of&#13;
domestically-produced goods by home markets adversely affected manufactured&#13;
exports, with a 71 percent decline in market shares.&#13;
The need for food imports, the import requirements of increased&#13;
investment, and the overvaluation of the exchange rate led to rapid increases&#13;
in Nigeria's imports. In 1978, non-fuel imports were more than double the&#13;
imports estimated on the assumption of unchanged income elasticities of import&#13;
demand. In the early part of the period, the acceleration of economic growth&#13;
also raised import levels but this effect wore off by 1978.&#13;
In fact, the rate of growth of GNP in the 1973-79 period only slightly&#13;
exceeded that for 1963-73, although investment shares more than doubled.&#13;
Apart from adverse developments in agriculture, this result is explained by&#13;
emphasis on capital intensive investments in the public sector and by&#13;
inefficiencies in the implementation of these investments.&#13;
With the adverse balance-of-payments effects of the policies applied,&#13;
additional net external financing turned positive at the end of the period&#13;
under consideration as did the actual resource gap. Financial requirements&#13;
were raised further by the dividends payable to the foreign oil companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Correspondingly, Nigeria was drawing down the reserves it earlier accumulated&#13;
and, in 1978, it borrowed substantial amounts abroad. Nevertheless, gross&#13;
debt service and gross external debt ratios remained negligible throughout the&#13;
period.&#13;
The Ivory Coast experienced a one-fifth increase of its average market&#13;
share in traditional primary exports that were dominated by two tree crops,&#13;
cocoa and coffee. It experienced a four-fifths rise in its market share in&#13;
cocoa beans, three-fifths in cocoa butter, and no change in cocoa paste.&#13;
Increases in market shares in coffee, cotton, and palm oil approximately&#13;
equalled the average increase for all traditional exports. Finally, the rise&#13;
in sawnwood exports matched the fall in the export of logs while a small&#13;
decrease was shown for bananas.&#13;
The large variety of traditional primary exports, defined as commodities&#13;
that accounted for at least 1.5 percent of export value in "1972", indicates&#13;
the success of the Ivory Coast in diversifying its primary sector during the&#13;
sixties in the framework of a relatively open economy. The process of&#13;
diversification continued further in the seventies, with increases in the&#13;
exportation of processed fish and fruits leading to a doubling of the&#13;
country's market share in nontraditional primary exports.&#13;
Notwithstanding the possibilities offered by free entry into the European&#13;
Common Market and by West African integration arrangements, the Ivory Coast&#13;
was less successful in developing manufactured exports. Rather, with the&#13;
decline in the real exchange rate, the market share of the Ivory Coast in&#13;
these commodities fell by one-fifth. Decreases were experienced in both&#13;
developed country and in developing country markets.&#13;
The overvaluation of the exchange rate also contributed to negative&#13;
import substitution that was aggravated by the import intensity of rising&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
investment. An increasing part of new investment was undertaken in the&#13;
framework of public investment programs that often involved high-cost,&#13;
capital-intensive investments. By 1976-79 the incremental capital-output&#13;
ratio exceeded the 1963-73 average by one-half, fully matching the rise in&#13;
investment shares.&#13;
The rise of public investment, together with increases in current public&#13;
expenditures, necessitated increased borrowing from abroad. Thus, notwith-&#13;
standing the favorable balance-of-payments effects of external shocks, the&#13;
ratio of the gross external debt to GNP rose from 17 percent in 1973 to 41&#13;
percent in 1978 in the Ivory Coast. Increases were smaller in debt service&#13;
ratios, from 9 percent in 1973 to 13 percent in 1978, as much of the borrowing&#13;
occurred towards the end of the period.&#13;
Conclusions and Evaluation&#13;
With export prices rising more rapidly than import prices, the three&#13;
North African countries experienced improvements in their "pure" terms of&#13;
trade but this was more than offset by the adverse effects of higher import&#13;
prices on their trade deficit, expressed in "1972" prices. And while&#13;
increased tourist receipts and workers remittances and, in the case of Egypt,&#13;
toll revenue from the Suez Canal, more-or-less matched the adverse balance-of-&#13;
payments effects of external shocks, all three countries relied on increased&#13;
external financing as losses in export market shares (except for Tunisia that&#13;
had a relatively open economy), negative import substitution, and the rise in&#13;
GDP growth rates augmented their balance of payments deficit. The increased&#13;
overvaluation of the exchange rate led to declines in export market shares in&#13;
Egypt and Morocco while growing food imports and the high import content of&#13;
increased investment contributed to negative import substitution in all three&#13;
countries.&#13;

There are differences among the three countries, however, as far as the&#13;
financing and the uses of new investment are concerned. Morocco relied to a&#13;
considerable extent on foreign borrowing and undertook large investment&#13;
projects of questionable efficiency that raised incremental capital-output&#13;
ratios and led to a decline in the rate of economic growth. Incremental&#13;
capital-output ratios rose to a lesser extent in Egypt and Tunisia, where&#13;
high-cost capital intensive investments were much less prevalent, and these&#13;
countries were also successful in improving their domestic savings effort.&#13;
In contrast to the three North African countries, Thailand utilized&#13;
domestic policy measures to offset the unfavorable balance-of-payments effects&#13;
of external shocks. Operating in the framework of an open economy, Thailand&#13;
increased its export market shares to a considerable extent and experienced&#13;
relatively efficient import substitution, leading to a decline in incremental&#13;
capital-output ratios.&#13;
In turn, the inefficiencies associated with high protection led to&#13;
increases in incremental capital-output ratios in the Philippines, where the&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of domestic policies were practically nil.&#13;
Correspondingly, notwithstanding its higher investment share, the rate of&#13;
economic growth was lower in the Philippines than in Thailand. Increases in&#13;
the rate of investment were financed in large part by foreign borrowing in the&#13;
Philippines, while Thailand relied primarily on increases In domestic savings&#13;
and hence little change occurred in its foreign debt position.&#13;
Kenya also largely relied on domestic savings to finance the rise of&#13;
investment activity. At the same time, Kenya maintained its relatively&#13;
outward-oriented stance and eschewed large, high-cost investment projects. It&#13;
was thus able to translate increased investments into higher rates of economic&#13;
growth.&#13;

In Jamaica, Peru, and Tanzania, the adverse effects of external shocks&#13;
were aggravated by internal shocks, entailing increased government&#13;
intervention and considerable price distortions. In all three countries, the&#13;
result was a substantial fall in domestic savings ratios and export shares and&#13;
an increase in incremental capital-output ratios. These adverse developments&#13;
led to an absolute decline of the gross national product in Jamaica; a fall in&#13;
incomes was avoided through massive foreign aid to Tanzania; and increased&#13;
external indebtedness occasioned the introduction of far-reaching reforms in&#13;
Peru, with subsequent increases in exports and savings.&#13;
Favorable external shocks, associated with increases in the prices of&#13;
petroleum in Indonesia and Nigeria, and in cocoa and coffee prices in the&#13;
Ivory Coast, gave rise to a rapid expansion of public investment in these&#13;
countries. The import needs of higher investment, together with the effects&#13;
of the appreciation of the real exchange rate, in turn, led to negative import&#13;
substitution in all three countries. Export shares, however, rose in&#13;
Indonesia and the Ivory Coast, reflecting gains in tree crops in both&#13;
countries, increased petroleum exports in Indonesia, and export&#13;
diversification in the relatively open economy of the Ivory Coast.&#13;
In all three countries, and especially in Nigeria, public investments&#13;
were concentrated in high-cost, capital-intensive activities. Incremental&#13;
capital-output ratios rose as a result, increasingly offsetting the effects of&#13;
higher investment shares on GNP growth. The Ivory Coast nevertheless&#13;
experienced an acceleration of its rate of economic growth as, on the whole,&#13;
it continued to follow a policy of outward orientation.&#13;
The findings point to the importance of the policies applied in response&#13;
to external shocks. Continued outward orientation in the Ivory Coast,&#13;
Thailand, and Tunisia led to increases in export market shares. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
conclusion also applies to Kenya if trade with Tanzania and Uganda is&#13;
excluded. By contrast, the largest losses in market shares were experienced&#13;
in Jamaica and Tanzania (even excluding trade with Kenya and Uganda), where&#13;
government interventions in the market mechanism in general, and protectionist&#13;
measures in particular, were the most far-reaching. In turn, increases in&#13;
export market shares had favorable effects on the rate of economic growth&#13;
whereas reliance on import substitution had the opposite effect.&#13;
These conclusions are supported by statistical evidence for the twelve&#13;
countries under study. To begin with, the Spearman rank correlation&#13;
coefficient between the extent of reliance on export promotion in response to&#13;
external shocks, defined as the ratio of the increment in exports associated&#13;
with increases in market shares to the balance of payments effects of external&#13;
shocks, and the rate of growth of GNW was 0.48 during the 1973-79 period,&#13;
statistically significant at the five percent level. The corresponding result&#13;
is 0.64, statistically significant at the' one percent level, if growth rates&#13;
are calculated for the 1975-79 period, in order to take account of lags in the&#13;
1/&#13;
adjustment .&#13;
Furthermore, reliance on import substitution and the rate of economic&#13;
growth are negatively correlated, with a rank correlation coefficient of -0.64&#13;
in the 1973-79 period, statistically significant at the one percent level.&#13;
This result reflects the rising cost of import substitution in the confines of&#13;
the narrow domestic markets of the developing countries as against the&#13;
lowering of costs through the exploitation of comparative advantage and the&#13;
1/ External shocks, and ratios of policy responses to external shocks, shown&#13;
En Table 7, are averages for the years 1974-78, calculated on a "1972"&#13;
basis. Signs have been reversed in the case of countries with positive&#13;
external shocks. The results are little affected if the increment in exports,&#13;
associated with increases in market shares, is related to GNP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
use of large-scale production methods under an outward oriented strategy.&#13;
There was no significant statistical relationship between reliance on&#13;
additional external financing in response to external shocks and the rate of&#13;
growth of GNP, the rank correlation coefficient being 0.20. This finding&#13;
points to the importance of domestic policy measures that is also indicated by&#13;
the lack of a statistically significant correlation between the balance-of-&#13;
payments effects of external shocks, expressed as a proportion of GNP, and the&#13;
rate of economic growth, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the&#13;
two variables being -0.16.&#13;
It further appears that, with the exception of Kenya and Thailand,l/ the&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of domestic policies, in the form of export&#13;
promotion, import substitution, and lowering the rate of growth of GNP,&#13;
aggravated the effects of adverse external shocks and thus necessitated&#13;
additional net external financing in excess of the balance-of-payments impact&#13;
of these shocks. In turn, countries experiencing favorable external shocks&#13;
supplemented increases in their foreign exchange receipts by foreign&#13;
borrowing.&#13;
The implications of investment allocation in countries that experienced a&#13;
continuing (Indonesia, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria) or temporary (Morocco and&#13;
Tunisia) increase in foreign exchange receipts, supplemented by foreign&#13;
borrowing, are of further interest. Morocco, Indonesia, and Nigeria and, to a&#13;
lesser extent, Tunisia and the Ivory Coast undertook high-cost capital&#13;
intensive public investments that raised incremental capital-output ratios and&#13;
adversely affected the rate of economic growth. Increased government&#13;
1/ Jamaica may also be considered an exception, although in this case the&#13;
outcome was determined by the lack of availability of foreign loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
intervention in economic life and reduced reliance on the price mechanism had&#13;
similar effects in Jamaica, Peru and Tanzania, where domestic savings ratios&#13;
and export shares also declined to a considerable extent.&#13;
Finally, there is evidence that, unless compensated by export-promoting&#13;
measures, the overvaluation of the exchange rate adversely affected exports in&#13;
the countries under consideration while negative interest rates and increased&#13;
budget deficits had unfavorable effects on the rate of savings. It would&#13;
appear, then, that adjustment to external shocks was conditioned to a&#13;
considerable extent by the domestic policies applied.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The paper provides estimates of the
            balance-of-payments effects of external shocks in the form
            of the deterioration of the terms of trade and the slowdown
            of world export demand in the individual countries. It
            further analyzes the policies applied and estimates the
            balance-of-payments effects of policy choices in the form of
            additional net external financing, export promotion, import
            substitution, and (temporarily) lowering the rate of
            economic growth. The results show export promotion to be
            positively and import substitution negatively correlated
            with the rate of economic growth in the period 1978-79. It
            further appears that, apart from Kenya and Thailand,
            countries experiencing adverse external shocks relied on
            financing from abroad rather than on domestic adjustment to
            cope with these shocks. Foreign borrowing was increased also
            in countries that experienced favorable external shocks,
            whether continuing or temporary, and the proceeds were used
            in large part to finance high-cost, capital-intensive public
            investment, with adverse effects in economic growth (in
            particular, in Morocco, Indonesia, and Nigeria).
