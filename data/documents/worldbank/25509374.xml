&amp;#12;Overview&#13;
Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s economy faces the challenge of adjusting to a large terms-of-trade shock in a&#13;
context of declining domestic and external demand. After a substantial drop during the second&#13;
half of 2014, oil prices remained low in 2015, averaging about US$53 per barrel during January-&#13;
October 2015, with negative implications for both domestic consumption and investor confidence.&#13;
Meanwhile, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP growth rate is estimated to have slowed to less than 7 percent, and Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy is estimated to contract by 3.8 percent in 2015, affecting demand for Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s exports&#13;
and, thus, translating into lower economic growth and inflation for Kazakhstan. Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s GDP&#13;
growth slowed from 4.1 percent (year-on-year) during the first nine months of 2014 to an estimated&#13;
1 percent during the same period in 2015. Oil prices dropped by more than 50 percent between June&#13;
2014 and October 2015, cutting export revenues by almost a half and creating a twin deficit in the&#13;
fiscal and current-account balances in 2015. In addition, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows&#13;
declined and the overall external balance deteriorated, putting downward pressure on the tenge.&#13;
Inflation decreased from 7.5 percent (year-on-year) in the beginning of 2015 to a historical low of&#13;
3.8 percent in August due to weaker domestic demand and lower fuel prices. However, inflation&#13;
appears to be rising once again in the wake of the recent exchange-rate adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
The authorities responded to the collapse of global oil prices through a rapid fiscal adjustment&#13;
followed by corresponding monetary and exchange-rate policy adjustments. In March 2015,&#13;
the government balanced out the earlier allocated spending for the infrastructure development&#13;
program Nurly Zhol with reductions or delays in other non-priority capital expenditures, allowing it&#13;
to keep the state budget deficit (or a debt accumulation) within 3 percent of GDP in 2015. Meanwhile,&#13;
the central bank tightened its monetary policy stance in support of the pegged exchange-rate regime&#13;
to ensure price and exchange rate stability. Tighter monetary policy reduced credit to the economy&#13;
despite the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s provision of subsidized loans to specific sectors. The defense of the pegged&#13;
exchange rate regime affected official international reserves. It also contributed to the real&#13;
appreciation of the tenge and dollarization of deposits in the banking system. In August 2015, the&#13;
authorities decided to move to a floating exchange rate and shift the countryâ&#128;&#153;s monetary policy to an&#13;
inflation-targeting regime. By end-October 2014, the tenge had lost about a third of its value against&#13;
the US dollar. These policy measures and the adjustment of the relative prices were necessary to&#13;
safeguard fiscal and external accounts sustainability in the medium term and help adjust national&#13;
income in a context of lower oil prices.&#13;
&#13;
A difficult external environment will continue to affect Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term outlook;&#13;
over the longer term diversification of the economy will increase its resilience to external&#13;
shocks. Under our baseline scenario, oil prices are expected to remain low through 2016 before&#13;
gradually recovering in 2017, supporting increased consumption and stronger investor confidence&#13;
over the medium term. GDP growth will remain at about 1 percent in 2015 and 2016, but may&#13;
increase to 3.3 percent in 2017. The lower-case scenario assumes that in 2016 oil prices will fall&#13;
further than in the baseline, worsening Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal and external positions and further&#13;
depressing domestic demand and GDP growth. Under both scenarios, domestic oil production is&#13;
expected to begin increasing in 2017 due to oil production in the Kashagan, boosting GDP growth and&#13;
improving the fiscal and current account balances. Nevertheless, the economy continues to face&#13;
significant downside risks, including the possibility of delays in Kashagan oil production or a&#13;
protracted recession in Russia and a further slowdown in China. Going forward, the successful&#13;
implementation of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ambitious structural reform agenda, including full&#13;
implementation of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, along with institutional reforms&#13;
and capacity building, human capital formation and continued investment in infrastructure should&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   |1&#13;
&amp;#12;boost productivity and competitiveness in the non-oil economy. Over time, this is expected to lay the&#13;
foundation for a more sustainable and diversified development path in Kazakhstan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.      Recent Political Developments&#13;
During the first ten months of 2015, Kazakhstan reaffirmed its political stability and the&#13;
government launched a new wave of structural reforms. President Nursultan Nazarbayev was&#13;
re-elected in April 2015 to a new five-year term with a solid margin of support. He promptly re-&#13;
nominated the government led by Prime Minister Karim Massimov, confirming the continuity of&#13;
political leadership and continued support for the structural reform agenda in the face of an&#13;
uncertain global economic climate and subdued Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth. In May 2015, the&#13;
government launched a new wave of institutional, social and economic reforms designed to support&#13;
nation building and economic development. The â&#128;&#156;One Hundred Concrete Steps, a Modern State for&#13;
Allâ&#128;&#157; program is focused on five priority areas for institutional reform: (i) professionalizing the public&#13;
administration, (ii) enforcing the rule of law, (iii) increasing public transparency and accountability&#13;
of the state, (iv) fostering economic diversification and growth, and (v) uniting the nation.&#13;
Strengthening institutions via the One Hundred Concrete Steps program, improving investments in&#13;
physical infrastructure via the Nurly Zhol program, and efforts to build human capital and enhance&#13;
workforce skills all represent key pillars of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s long-term development strategy,&#13;
Kazakhstan 2050, the objective of which is to develop a more diversified, knowledge-based economy&#13;
led by the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.      Recent Economic Developments&#13;
Worsening external conditions led to slower growth in Kazakhstan&#13;
&#13;
In 2015, the ongoing slump in global oil prices and weak domestic and external demand&#13;
adversely impacted Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s GDP growth. Growth slowed from 3.9 percent, year-on-year&#13;
(y/y), in the first half (H1) of 2014 to 1.7 percent in H1 2015 (Table 1). Preliminary estimates indicate&#13;
that GDP growth slowed to about 1 percent (y/y) in the first nine months of 2015, compared to 4.1&#13;
percent during the corresponding period in 2014. The precipitous drop in oil prices during H2 2014&#13;
influenced negatively domestic demand, while slowing growth in China (below 7 percent) and the&#13;
contraction of the Russian economy (-3.7 percent during the first nine months of 2015) diminished&#13;
external demand. Household consumption contracted by 2.3 percent (y/y) in 2014, then rebounded&#13;
by 1.4 percent in H1 2015 as households presumably began drawing down their savings. Government&#13;
consumption slowed as a result of the fiscal adjustment undertaken in response to the oil-price shock.&#13;
The growth rate of fixed capital investment fell from 5.1 percent (y/y) in H1 2014 to 2.8 percent in&#13;
H1 2015 as devaluation expectations, competition from Russian imports, and uncertain global&#13;
economic prospects weakened investor confidence.&#13;
&#13;
Industrial output continued to contract, while growth in the service sector slowed sharply.&#13;
Industrial production contracted by 1.3 percent (y/y) in the first ten months of 2015, mainly due to&#13;
a contraction in mining. Mining output fell by 2.2 percent in the first ten months of 2015 due to&#13;
reduced demand for oil and metals from China and Russia. Manufacturing growth accelerated from&#13;
0.3 percent in the first ten months of 2014 to 0.5 percent during the same period in 2015, as a 15.3&#13;
percent expansion in the metallurgical subsector offset declines in food and beverages (-0.6 percent),&#13;
oil refining (-5.3 percent), and an especially sharp drop in auto assembly (-55 percent). Oil refining&#13;
and auto assembly were negatively affected by the appreciation of the tenge against the Russian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2|&#13;
&amp;#12;ruble, which led to a surge in merchandise imports from Russia.1 Growth in services halved from 5.7&#13;
percent (y/y) in the first nine months of 2014 to 2.4 percent in same period of 2015. Preliminary data&#13;
suggest that the growth of domestic trade, a major component of the service sector, has been slowing&#13;
sharply due to weaker domestic demand. Agriculture grew by about 1.9 percent in the first ten&#13;
months of 2015, marginally higher than in the previous year (Figure 1).&#13;

&#13;
Weaker domestic demand and lower fuel prices reduced inflation in the first eight months of&#13;
2015, but the pass-through effect of the tenge depreciation since August appears to have&#13;
reversed this trend. Headline inflation fell from 7.5 percent (y/y) in the beginning of 2015 to a&#13;
historical low of 3.8 percent in August, but by September a combination of the exchange-rate&#13;
adjustment and the related removal of price controls on gasoline had begun pushing up consumer&#13;
prices. As a result, headline inflation averaged 4 percent (y/y) in Q3 2015 but jumped to 9.4 percent&#13;
in October (Figure 2). Food-price inflation that initially dropped from 8.7 percent (y/y) in January&#13;
2015 to 3.5 percent in August, then increased to 3.8 percent in September and 8.0 percent in October.&#13;
Non-food price inflation also initially fell from 7.4 percent (y/y) in January 2015 to 2.9 percent in&#13;
August, due in large part to fall in the prices for imported cars and both domestic and imported fuel.&#13;
However, it rebounded to 4.5 percent in September as gasoline prices adjusted and further up to 14.5&#13;
percent in October due to the pass-through effect of the tenge depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1 As a result of the oil price shock, the Russian ruble has lost a half of its value vis-Ã -vis the U.S. dollar since mid-October&#13;
2014 when the Central Bank of Russia switched to a floating exchange rate regime, while the Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s tenge remained&#13;
relatively stable, leading to an appreciation of the tenge vis-Ã -vis the ruble (until August 2015, when Kazakhstan also moved&#13;
to a floating regime).&#13;

A weakening external position has put pressure on the tenge&#13;
&#13;
The trade surplus narrowed substantially in 2015, and the current account went into deficit.&#13;
As oil prices fell and external demand from China and Russia weakened (for metal and metal&#13;
products, in particular), total export revenues plunged from US$62.7 billion in first nine months of&#13;
2014 to US$36.4 billion in the first nine months of 2015 (Table 2). Total imports also fell during the&#13;
same period due to weaker domestic demand but not as sharply as exports. Russian imports, which&#13;
increased during the past twelve months due to relatively lower prices, partially offset a potentially&#13;
higher decline in import volumes. Consequently, the merchandise trade surplus narrowed by two-&#13;
thirds in 2015, compared to 2014, and the current account dropped from a surplus of US$6.1 billion&#13;
in the first half of 2014 to a deficit of US$4.0 billion in the same period of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The capital and financial accounts present a more complex picture, as foreign direct&#13;
investment declined and short-term capital outflows increased. While net investment inflows&#13;
(excluding investments of the national oil fund) declined in 2015, mainly due to an increased outflow&#13;
of short-term capital, they were partially offset by foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and&#13;
external borrowing by residents of Kazakhstan. According to World Bank estimates based on official&#13;
data, net short-term capital and other FX outflows included in errors and omissions, increased from&#13;
US$7.8 billion during 2014 to US$9.0 billion in the first nine months of 2015. Estimates by Halyk Bank&#13;
indicate that in 2014 about US$11 billion in short-term FX outflows represented an increased&#13;
spending by Kazakhstani citizens on goods and services in Russia due to the appreciation of the tenge&#13;
vis-Ã -vis the ruble.2 Moreover, as net FDI inflows halved from US$7.6 billion in the first nine months&#13;
of 2014 to US$3.6 billion in the same period of 2015, they only partially offset the outflow in short-&#13;
term capital, leading to a deficit in the capital and financial accounts. As a result, the overall external&#13;
balance-of-payments (excluding investments of the oil fund) worsened substantially from a surplus&#13;
of US$8.4 billion in the first nine months of 2014 to a deficit of US$6.1 billion in the same period of&#13;
2015, putting pressure on official reserves and the tenge.&#13;

Labor market and poverty indicators continued to improve despite the economic&#13;
slowdown&#13;
&#13;
The unemployment rate fell even as growth slowed. The official unemployment rate slid from 5&#13;
percent in Q2 2015 to 4.9 percent in Q3 2015 (Figure 3). A World Bank analysis suggests that the&#13;
elasticity of employment to growth in Kazakhstan is about 0.23 percent; i.e., a 1 percent increase in&#13;
GDP leads to a 0.23 percent increase in the number of jobs. As growth slowed employment creation&#13;
would have been expected to decline accordingly, and given an estimated annual inflow of 150&#13;
thousand new job seekers, unemployment should have increased during this period. However, this&#13;
was not the case, and the official unemployment rate continued to fall. This may be due to the&#13;
existence of local programs to contain the shedding of labor during economic downturns, through&#13;
which workers are put on administrative leave, but are not registered as unemployed. Also, the&#13;
decrease in the labor force participation rate may exceed what is recorded in the official data. The&#13;
size of the economically active population shrank by about 58 thousand workers (y/y) in Q3 2015,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  |5&#13;
&amp;#12;while the number of employed workers fell by 44 thousand, including self-employed, yet the number&#13;
of economically inactive population increased by 40 thousand.3&#13;
&#13;
The poverty rate also continued to decline despite the slowing growth. The national poverty&#13;
rate dropped from 3.8 percent (at the national poverty rate) in 2012 to 2.9 percent in 2013 and 2.8&#13;
percent in 2014, reaching 2.7 percent in Q2 2015 (Figure 4). However, this may be due in part to&#13;
measurement issues involving the national poverty line. Since 2003 average annual adjustments to&#13;
the nominal national poverty line has not fully reflected nominal wage growth in all years except&#13;
2008 and 2011. In addition, a combination of rising public sector wages, greater social spending and&#13;
price controls is mitigating the impact of slower growth on poverty. Yet given that poverty reduction&#13;
in Kazakhstan has been largely driven by employment creation, especially in the service sector, and&#13;
real wage increases, a slowdown in GDP growth and job creation would suggest a slowdown in the&#13;
pace of poverty reduction. Accelerating poverty reduction and promoting shared prosperity will&#13;
require a greater focus on the rural and regional dimensions of poverty.&#13;

C.             Macroeconomic Policies&#13;
The government has launched a fiscal adjustment plan in response to persistently low&#13;
oil prices&#13;
&#13;
In response to the oil price shock the government has adjusted its on-budget expenditures&#13;
promptly and initiated a fiscal consolidation for the medium term, but off-budget spending&#13;
caused the estimated nonoil deficit to widen between 2014 and 2015. As oil prices were forecast&#13;
to remain low over the near term the government revised its planned 2015 budget in March, with&#13;
total budget cuts estimated at about 8 percent of the initial budget (Box 1). The 2015 GDP growth&#13;
estimate was revised to reflect a new baseline oil price of US$50 per barrel, down from the US$80&#13;
per barrel used in the original budget. Increases in some public sector salaries were delayedâ&#128;&#148;though&#13;
social expenditures and the vulnerable groups protectedâ&#128;&#148;and on-budget transfers to state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SOEs) were reduced. Finally, the new budget eliminated or delayed low-priority capital&#13;
expenditures, offsetting the investment spending under the Nurly Zhol program. As a result, on-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3 i.e. students, persons occupied solely in domestic duties in their own households, members of collective households,&#13;
inmates of institutions, retired persons, persons living entirely on their own means, and persons wholly dependent upon&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
6|&#13;
&amp;#12;budget spending is expected to fall from 21.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.9 percent in 2015.&#13;
However, an off-budget transaction to support the state oil-and-gas company Kazmunaygaz widened&#13;
the nonoil deficit. Low oil prices affected Kazmunaygazâ&#128;&#153;s ability to meet its debt-repayment schedule,&#13;
and in June 2015 the government allocated US$2.7 billion from the national oil fund to finance the&#13;
SOEâ&#128;&#153;s external debt payments. 4 As total revenue is expected to drop by about 6.4 percent of GDP and&#13;
total expenditure is planned to increase by about 1.3 percent, overall fiscal balance will deteriorate&#13;
from a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of about 7 percent in 2015. The nonoil deficit&#13;
will increase from 10.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13 percent in 2015. Assuming the medium-term&#13;
fiscal consolidation continues as planned, public spending could fall from 23.5 percent of GDP&#13;
estimated in 2015 to about 20 percent by 2017, narrowing the nonoil deficit to 9 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
    Box 1. The Composition of the Expenditure Cuts&#13;
    The Government is pursuing fiscal consolidation in line with the medium-term objective of reaching&#13;
    sustainable non-oil deficit levels. While the fiscal adjustment effort has cut or delayed elements of both&#13;
    current and capital expenditures, it is also focusing on efficiency of expenditures. Current spending&#13;
    represents 45 percent of Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s budget, and capital investment comprises 55 p ercent. Capital&#13;
    expenditures have borne the brunt of recent cuts, but this is tempered by the investment demands of the&#13;
    Nurly Zhol program. The table below summarizes key budget revisions. Principal areas of adjustment and&#13;
    reprioritization are as follows. First, the budgets of the Ministry of National Economy (MNE) and Ministry of&#13;
    Investment and Development (MID) are being cut substantially. The cuts will come from a variety of sources:&#13;
    suspension of projects that are not close to initiation, new projects delayed or transferred to SOEs for&#13;
    implementation, some current expenditure cuts, and in the case of MID, streamlining some of the industrial&#13;
    support and subsidy programs. Second, scheduled civil servants salary increases and the launch of the&#13;
    piloting the per-capita financing in education have been delayed. Third, the authorities are also revising the&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;Employment Roadmap 2020â&#128;&#157; in an effort to increase its efficiency within a smaller budget envelop. Fourth,&#13;
    the security sectorâ&#128;&#148;including the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Defense and the National Security&#13;
    Committeeâ&#128;&#148;will have their capital budgets for 2015 and 2016 revised downward. Fifth, other line agencies&#13;
    will be subject to more modest budget cuts.&#13;

4 Moreover, in July 2015, the central bank announced it would arrange a US$4 billion debt swap with Samruk-Kazyna for a&#13;
10 percent stake in Kazmunaygaz. This does not affect the consolidated budget, as it reflects a change in financing&#13;
instruments.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    |7&#13;
&amp;#12;As oil prices are expected to remain low, the authorities are considering strategies for&#13;
sustaining the fiscal consolidation. The current adjustment plan relies heavily on cuts to on-budget&#13;
investment spending, which were reduced by about 2 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2015 and&#13;
are expected to decline further to about 3.7 percent of GDP in 2017. The authorities are working to&#13;
enhance the efficiency of the public investment program through various reforms such as adoption&#13;
of new cost norms and revising the law on private-public partnerships in an effort to leverage the&#13;
impact of limited public resources for increased development impact. The authorities are also&#13;
implementing customs and tax administration reforms designed to boost nonoil revenues. At the&#13;
same time they are considering tax policy measures to enhance non-oil tax revenues. Eliminating&#13;
loopholes and tax incentives provided under the various public programs could yield significant&#13;
revenue gains. Finally, to ensure sustainability of the consolidation the administration has pledged,&#13;
and per President Nazarbayevâ&#128;&#153;s mandate, to keeping withdraws from the oil fund to the guaranteed&#13;
amount, foregoing any additional â&#128;&#156;targetedâ&#128;&#157; withdraws until 2018. This commitment encompass es&#13;
both on- and off-budget expenditures.&#13;

The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s net debt position is expected to remain solid. Total government debt rose&#13;
from 14.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 17.0 percent in 2015. This increase was due in part to a US$4&#13;
billion Eurobond issue combined with multilateral borrowing in the context of the 2015-17&#13;
Partnership Framework Arrangement (PFA) program supporting the â&#128;&#156;Kazakhstan 2050â&#128;&#157;&#13;
development strategy.5 However, the fiscal consolidation should help to reduce overall government&#13;

&amp;#12;debt in the medium term. Also, despite lower oil prices the net foreign-exchange savings in the oil&#13;
fund are projected to increase from 33.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 36.1 percent in 2015, partly&#13;
reflecting the valuation effect resulting from the move to a free float.6 The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s net financial&#13;
asset position (i.e. oil fund foreign-exchange reserves minus total government debt) is expected to&#13;
remain flat at about 19 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015.&#13;
&#13;
A floating exchange rate regime was introduced in August 2015&#13;
&#13;
Despite the fall in oil prices and weakened external position, the authorities maintained the&#13;
nominal exchange rate as monetary anchor until mid-August 2015, when they announced a&#13;
shift to a floating regime. In 2014, the authorities indicated that maintaining stability of the&#13;
nominal exchange rate peg was a part of the economic support program aimed at mitigating the&#13;
effects of the external oil price shock on the national economy. In the Joint government and NBKâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Annual Statement of Economic Policy for 2015, the authorities announced a plan to transition to an&#13;
inflation-targeting regime over the medium term, implying a shift to a float, and the central bank&#13;
began establishing the necessary legal and technical groundwork. From February 2014 to June 2015&#13;
the tenge depreciated against the US dollar by about 2-3 percent in nominal terms (Figure 5). In June,&#13;
the crawling depreciation of the tenge accelerated, possibly fed by the increased availability of tenge&#13;
liquidity and low money market interest rates that started in late May. On July 15 the central bank&#13;
announced a widening of the band around the central parity 185 KZT/US$ from +3/-15 to +13/-15&#13;
in preparation for the transition to inflation targeting. However, in the aftermath of the unexpected&#13;
4.4 percent devaluation of the Chinese yuan on August 17th-18th, and the subsequent collapse of&#13;
global oil prices, the authorities opted to float the tenge on August 20th. The tenge immediately lost&#13;
about 26 percent of its value, falling from 188.4 KZT/US$ to 254 KZT/US$. It continued to slide to&#13;
about 280 KTZ/US$ by end October 2015, with the central bank intervening to address episodes of&#13;
volatility.&#13;
&#13;
The defense of the nominal anchor until August 2015 affected official international reserves,&#13;
contributed to the appreciation of the real exchange rate and the dollarization of deposits.&#13;
According to the authorities, defending the exchange rate cost about US$28 billion between early&#13;
2014 and mid-2015.7 This also led to a significant change in the quality of international reserves held&#13;
at the central bank marked by an increase of short-term contingent foreign-exchange liabilities to&#13;
residents of Kazakhstan. The defense of the nominal anchor also led to the appreciation of the real&#13;
effective exchange rate (REER). The REER index stood at 122.2 in July 2015, up from 100 in July&#13;
2014.8 The tenge began to appreciate against the ruble in real terms in October 2014, when the latter&#13;
shifted to a floating regime. As a result, the bilateral real exchange rate index rose from 83.4 to a peak&#13;
of 125 in January 2015, then eased to 102.9 by July 2015. The appreciation of the bilateral real&#13;
exchange rate led to a temporary surge in merchandise imports from Russia. Meanwhile, the&#13;
expectation of an eventual exchange-rate adjustment led to dollarization of deposits. The share of&#13;
dollar-denominated deposits rose from about 39 percent in January 2014 to about 55 percent in&#13;
January 2015, before moderating to 52 percent in July 2015. The share of dollar-denominated time&#13;
deposits held by individuals rose from 49 percent in January 2014 to 73 percent in July 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The switch to the floating exchange rate is helping relative prices to adjust to the new reality&#13;
of lower oil prices, with the tenge depreciation expected to impact domestic demand. The&#13;
REER index fell from 122.2 in July 2015 to 109.9 in September.9 Since then the tenge has continued&#13;
&#13;
6 In 2015 the increase in the oil fundâ&#128;&#153;s foreign-exchange reserves (as a share of GDP) was due to exchange-rate effects; while&#13;
&#13;
in nominal dollars terms the reserves declined from US$73 billion at the end-2014 to below US$64 billion by October 2015.&#13;

&amp;#12;to adjust, depreciating by 35 percent to reach about KZT 280/US$ by end-October 2015. The&#13;
deprecation of the tenge is expected to affect aggregate demand through both wealth and price&#13;
effects. The wealth effect is expected to be relatively small and stems from the loss in value of tenge-&#13;
denominated holdings, which may lead households to reduce consumption and cause businesses to&#13;
defer planned investments. The dollarization of deposits may mitigate this effect, and the&#13;
government has announced a program to compensate holders of tenge-denominated deposits valued&#13;
at up to one million tenge (about US$3,800). The authorities have also launched income-support&#13;
programs for selected groups. As only 3.7 percent of bank lending is in the form of foreign-exchange&#13;
loans to individuals, a relatively small number of households are expected to face a larger repayment&#13;
burden. However, this may be alleviated somewhat by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s new mortgage-refinancing&#13;
program. Depreciation may also affect aggregate demand through rising import prices. Private&#13;
demand is projected to weaken further as household purchasing power erodes and businesses face&#13;
higher prices for imported intermediate and capital goods. The authorities have announced price&#13;
controls on 33 basic food products to mitigate the pass-through effects of the depreciation, and the&#13;
significant degree of economic slack should also buffer the price effect. Nevertheless, domestic&#13;
consumer prices had already risen by September and are expected to increase further in the next few&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
The depreciation will impact the financial sector by undermining certain bank assets, but its&#13;
impact is not expected to be nearly as large as it was during the global financial crisis. In Q3&#13;
2009, just before the crisis unfolded, foreign exchange represented about 50 percent of total bank&#13;
lending. Yet foreign-exchange lending has steadily declined over the past few years, falling from 42.3&#13;
percent of total lending in 2010 to 23.3 percent in July 2015. This should reduce the impact of the&#13;
depreciation on bank assets. Foreign-currency lending to physical persons also declined during the&#13;
same period, dropping from 10.1 percent to 3.7 percent of total lending. Bank balance sheets do not&#13;
yet reflect asset deterioration; indeed, the system-wide share of nonperforming loans (NPLs)&#13;
declined from 23.5 percent in January to 9.4 percent in August following Kazkommertsbank/BTA&#13;
purchase-and-assumption agreement in June. Nevertheless, financial sector risk needs to be&#13;
monitored closely by the government and the central bank. Already, in September Moodyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
downgraded four top banks based on their substantial foreign-exchange exposure and/or limited&#13;
capital buffers. The negative effects of the depreciation should be viewed as tradeoffs against&#13;
expected medium-term benefits in terms of improved tenge liquidity and access to hedging&#13;
instruments to mitigate asset-liability mismatches. It is expected that further resolution of NPLs in&#13;
the BTA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and across the banking sector will free up bank resources to&#13;
finance domestic economic activity. Strengthening the corporate insolvency framework and creating&#13;
the basis for a personal insolvency framework will also be critical to enable the sustainable growth&#13;
of credit to the economy.&#13;

Monetary policy remained tight in early 2015 to support the nominal exchange rate&#13;
anchor, but started relaxing in late spring&#13;
&#13;
An evolving monetary policy stance influenced money market interest rates during the first&#13;
nine months of 2015. The authorities tightened monetary policy in support of the nominal&#13;
exchange-rate anchor during the first five months of the year. Consequently, money market interest&#13;
rates were relatively high and volatile, ranging from 7 to 15 percent (Figure 7). From June to mid-&#13;
August the rates declined to about 4 percent as the central bank began providing short-term tenge&#13;
liquidity through money market interventions in addition to ongoing long-term subsidized funding&#13;
from the national pension fund and foreign-exchange swaps from its own reserves. Additionally, at&#13;
end-June 2015 Kazkommertzbank signed an agreement with the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s Problem Loans Fund,&#13;
securing a ten-year 250 billion tenge deposit.&#13;
&#13;
Tight monetary policy caused credit to the economy to contract, prompting selective&#13;
interventions by the authorities. Credit contracted by about 12 percent between January and&#13;
August 2015, as bank funding costs increased and deposits were converted into foreign exchange&#13;
(Figure 8). Credit to businesses contracted by about 19 percent between January and July before&#13;
beginning to expand in August. Credit to individual borrowers remained flat in July and grew by 3.3&#13;
percent in August due to the increasing value of dollar-denominated loans associated with the tenge&#13;
depreciation. To address the tight credit environment the authorities extended subsidized credit&#13;
programs (capped at a nominal 6 percent) for small and medium enterprises and launched two&#13;
subsidy programs for mortgage refinancing and the purchase of cars assembled domestically. This&#13;
intervention spurred a partial recovery of credit growth in targeted sectors.&#13;

&#13;
The implementation of the new monetary policy takes time and an effective monetary&#13;
transmission channel&#13;
&#13;
While the move to inflation targeting will facilitate the economyâ&#128;&#153;s adjustment to lower oil&#13;
prices, the central bank faces a key challenge in developing a functional and credible inflation-&#13;
targeting regime. Since the shift to a floating regime, the tenge has experienced episodes of&#13;
volatility, and the central bank has intervened to stabilize its value. It will take time for the new&#13;
inflation-targeting regime to become fully functional and for market participants to understand its&#13;
risks and benefits. A functional inflation-targeting regime requires an effective interest-rate&#13;
transmission channel that can signal changes in monetary aggregates to market participants,&#13;
influencing economic activity and thereby altering the inflation rate.&#13;
&#13;
The central bank must ensure that its interest-rate transmission channel is effective. In the&#13;
past, Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s interest-rate transmission system has not always functioned properly. The central&#13;
bank launched a new base rateâ&#128;&#148;the 12 percent overnight repo rateâ&#128;&#148;in early September in an effort&#13;
to reestablish the interest-rate transmission system. Managing the new base rate will require the&#13;
central bank to use monetary policy instruments, including repo and reverse repo auctions, to adjust&#13;
liquidity in the banking system. The challenge will be to ensure that interest-rate signals are&#13;
transmitted through the banking system to consumers and businesses. â&#128;&#156;The Monetary Policy of the&#13;
Republic of Kazakhstan through 2020,â&#128;&#157; provides a transparent and predictable roadmap to&#13;
implement the new monetary policy. The frequent publication of detailed progress reports on its&#13;
implementation would help to ensure a smooth transition to the inflation-targeting regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.      Structural Reforms&#13;
The authorities continue to implement an ambitious reform agenda&#13;
&#13;
Kazakhstan will become the 162nd member of WTO in December 2015 and is expected to&#13;
benefit from liberalizing its economy going forward. Negotiations concluded in June 2015 and&#13;
President Nazarbayev signed the protocol of accession in July. The Parliament approved the&#13;
accession in October. The process is expected to be finalized in December at the WTOâ&#128;&#153;s annual&#13;
ministerial conference. Within the framework of the Eurasia Customs Union (EaCU) and the Eurasian&#13;
Economic Union (EEU) Kazakhstan adopted fifty new laws and introduced amendments to ten&#13;
international agreements to align its legal framework with WTO rules and regulations. Further&#13;
&#13;
12|&#13;
&amp;#12;adjustments are being made based on the commitments made in the WTO protocol. WTO accession&#13;
is expected to encourage international integration and bolster competitiveness. Over the next few&#13;
years Kazakhstan is expected to lower its average trade weighted tariff to about 5.5 percent, similar&#13;
to the average rate that prevailed in 2009, before it joined the EaCU and then the EEU. Lower tariffs&#13;
will reduce costs to consumers and domestic producers, improving price and quality, and promoting&#13;
more robust competition in the domestic market. The accession reforms will also liberalize important&#13;
segments of the service sector, which represents over half of the national economy. Opening the&#13;
financial and telecommunications subsectors, increasing labor mobility and expanding access to&#13;
foreign technical and managerial experts will promote FDI. Kazakhstan has also committed to&#13;
phasing out trade-related investment measures and local content requirements included in its&#13;
investment regime, which is expected to increase the quality and efficiency of production and&#13;
services in key sector, including in mining and petroleum production. Finally, Kazakhstan will benefit&#13;
from access to the WTO dispute-settlement mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
The authorities are recasting their approach to industrial development to better promote&#13;
industrialization and diversification of the economy. The first State Program for Industrial and&#13;
Innovative Development (SPIID) for 2010-14 was not as successful as the authorities hoped, as&#13;
economic diversification remained elusive. A recent review suggested that the SPIID could have&#13;
benefitted from greater private sector participation and improved interagency coordination. A more&#13;
â&#128;&#156;SMARTâ&#128;&#157; (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound) design would have most likely&#13;
resulted in better results. Moreover, subsidies provided through the program distorted competition&#13;
between firms. The authorities are revising the subsequent SPIID II program for 2015-19 to reflect&#13;
these lessons, broadening the focus to encompass multidimensional business climate reform as well&#13;
as support to specific sectors. The program will also include a more market-driven incentive&#13;
framework. The government plans to allocate KZT 600 billion (approximately US$2 billion) from the&#13;
national budget to implement the SPIID II, with additional funding for specific investments in 14&#13;
targeted subsectors. The â&#128;&#156;territorial clustersâ&#128;&#157; program is one of the main tools under the SPIID II.&#13;
&#13;
The authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; ambitious institutional reform agenda was bolstered by the launch of the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;One Hundred Concrete Steps, a Modern State for Allâ&#128;&#157; program in May 2015. The program is&#13;
one of the pillars of the Kazakhstan 2050 vision, which acts as the overarching development strategy&#13;
of the country, and complements the Nurly Zhol economic support program â&#128;&#147; announced in fall 2014&#13;
and focused on infrastructure, private sector support and financial sector reforms â&#128;&#147; and the&#13;
authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; ongoing reform agenda on industrialization and diversification (the SPIID II). The&#13;
program is designed to reduce the regulatory and economic imprint of the public sector and develop&#13;
a more professional, efficient and transparent modern state, imbued with a regulatory mandate with&#13;
a much lighter touch. The program includes measures to create a more effective and professional&#13;
public service through open recruitment, better training and the linking of pay and promotion to&#13;
performance. To make the rule of law more transparent, trials by jury will be expanded and the rights&#13;
of defendants will be increased. Judges will serve a probationary period before full confirmation&#13;
while police recruitment and training are to improve, as is their accountability to local communities.&#13;
To increase accountability to the population, the program includes devolution of decisions to the local&#13;
level â&#128;&#147; as the authorities are pursuing devolution of budget expenditures to the local authorities in&#13;
parallel. The expanded use of e-government systems is also expected to accelerate administrative&#13;
processes and decrease corruption, and agencies at various administrative levels will be required to&#13;
publish regular performance information. The success of the reform agenda, however, will depend&#13;
on its effective and comprehensive implementation.&#13;

&amp;#12;E.       Outlook&#13;
Continued Low oil prices and global economic uncertainty will affect Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
medium term outlook&#13;
&#13;
The global oil supply is expected to outpace demand over the medium term, maintaining&#13;
downward pressure on oil prices. Oil prices briefly rallied early in the summer of 2015, but then&#13;
dropped again after the announcement of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran. Brent Oil prices edged&#13;
up from a low of US$47 per barrel in January 2015 to US$66 per barrel in mid-May, then fell back to&#13;
about US$48 in August due to the anticipated removal of sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Following&#13;
the deal Iran immediately began selling off its reserves, and the Minister of Oil announced that Iran&#13;
intended to regain its market share regardless of international prices. While Iranian oil production&#13;
will not reach capacity for another year, the formal reentry of Iran into the global oil market, along&#13;
with the expectation of increased production in Iraq and OPECâ&#128;&#153;s refusal to cut production are&#13;
expected to keep oil prices low over the short-to-medium term, despite a decline in US oil output as&#13;
the shale oil subsector is consolidated.10 Meanwhile, a slow and uneven global economic recovery is&#13;
expected to keep demand for oil subdued. Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.4 percent&#13;
in 2014 to 3.1 percent in 2015 before rising to 3.6 percent in 2016. Aggregate GDP growth in&#13;
advanced economies is projected to accelerate slightly from 1.8 percent in 2014 to 2 percent in 2015&#13;
and 2.2 percent in 2016, driven by the US recovery. However, growth in emerging markets and&#13;
developing economies is expected to slow from 4.6 percent in 2014 to an estimated 4 percent in 2015,&#13;
then rebound to a projected 4.5 percent in 2016.11 Given these expected developments, World Bank&#13;
projects average oil prices (Brent-Dubai-WTI) at US$52.5 per barrel in 2015, US$51.4 in 2016, and&#13;
US$54.6 per barrel in 2017 in the baseline scenario.&#13;

Growth among Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s main trade partners is expected to remain uneven over the&#13;
medium term, negatively impacting demand for both oil and nonoil exports. The euro zone,&#13;
Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s largest oil export market, is still grappling with the uncertainty of the Greek debt crisis,&#13;
and growth is expected to reach a modest 1.9 percent in 2015 and 2016. China is another major&#13;
export market for Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s oil and metals products, and Chinese growth is expected to slide from&#13;
6.8 percent in 2015 to 6.3 percent in 2016 as the country continues as the economy transitions to a&#13;
new development model and the government attempts to implement structural reforms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10 The World Bank estimates that, ceteris paribus, an increase in Iranian oil exports by 1 million barrels per year to pre-&#13;
sanction levels, would cause global oil prices to fall by about 14 percent, or about US$10 per barrel, in 2016 (MENA QEB&#13;
July 2015).&#13;

&amp;#12;deleverage the internal debt burden.12 The Russian economy, a major destination for Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
metal exports, is expected to contract by 3.8 percent in 2015 and by 0.6 percent in 2016, also due in&#13;
large part to falling oil prices and the impact of the depreciation of the Ruble and related inflation on&#13;
domestic demand.13 In the first half of 2015 the appreciation of the tenge against the ruble led to a&#13;
surge in Russian exports to Kazakhstan, heightening price competition with domestic producers. The&#13;
shift to a floating regime in mid-August is expected to slow the influx of imports, but exports are&#13;
expected to remain subdued due to the Russian recession&#13;

In this context, the current baseline scenario assumes that Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s GDP growth rate will&#13;
slow unless oil prices rise and output increases. The growth rate is projected to drop substantially&#13;
from 4.4 percent in 2014 to about 1 percent in 2015 as oil prices remain low leading to contraction&#13;
of domestic demand (Table 5). The uncertain external outlook will dampen private investment, while&#13;
the pass-through effect of the tenge depreciation will reduce household consumption and public&#13;
consumption will remain modest due to the ongoing fiscal adjustment. Weak domestic demand will&#13;
in turn negatively affect production and retail trade, while low oil prices continue to slow the growth&#13;
of ancillary subsectors such as transportation and wholesale trade. Both the fiscal and current-&#13;
account balances are expected to turn negative in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The projected recovery of oil prices over the medium term is expected to boost domestic&#13;
demand. Under the baseline scenario GDP growth is projected to be about 1 percent in 2016. While&#13;
the overall fiscal balance improves due to the consolidation effort, the current-account balance is&#13;
expected to worsen as oil production is expected to fall from 80.1 million metric tons in 2015 to 77.0&#13;
in 2016. If the Kashagan oilfield begins production in 2017 as planned, increased oil output may&#13;
improve consumer and investor confidence, boosting economic growth to 3.3 percent in 2017, and&#13;
improving fiscal and current account balances. However, if oil prices remain low, there is an&#13;
additional downside risk that production at Kashagan may be postponed. Consumer price inflation&#13;
(as defined by the official year-end consumer price index) in 2015 will be affected by the depreciation&#13;
of the tenge, while the low domestic demand is expected to attenuate some of the inflationary&#13;
pressures in 2016. Import prices and producer prices more fully reflect the pass-through effect of the&#13;
tenge depreciation, and both are likely to experience higher rates of inflation in 2016.&#13;

Under the baseline scenario, government debt is expected to remain low while fiscal reserves&#13;
in the oil fund will stop rising. As part of the fiscal adjustment, the government plans to reduce&#13;
annual net borrowing from the planned level of 3 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 1 percent by 2018.&#13;
This should keep the public debt stock stable at about 14-16 percent of GDP over the medium term.&#13;
While external public debt and state guarantees are expected to rise from about 4 percent of GDP in&#13;
2014 to between 6 and 7 percent in 2015-17, domestic public debt is expected to drop from about 11&#13;
percent of GDP to about 7-9 percent during the same period. The increase in external debt is driven&#13;
by a US$4 billion Eurobond issue in 2015 (in addition to a US$2.5 billion bond issue in 2014) coupled&#13;
with an anticipated commitment of about US$7 billion in multilateral borrowing in the context of the&#13;
implementation of the 2015-17 Partnership Framework Arrangement. Meanwhile, net foreign-&#13;
exchange savings in the oil fund are projected to stop growing, because low oil prices (below a&#13;
breakeven of US$80-90 per barrel) suggest that the government draw on oil revenue to finance the&#13;
nonoil deficit. As a result, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s net financial asset position (i.e. Oil Fund FX reserves&#13;
minus Total government debt) is expected to stabilize around 19 percent of GDP over the medium&#13;
term.&#13;
&#13;
The low case scenario assumes that oil prices will remain low over the medium term, leading&#13;
to a slower economic recovery than in the baseline. A further excess of supply over demand could&#13;
cause oil prices to fall below expectations. In this scenario both export revenues and growth in&#13;
ancillary subsectors to oil, such as technical services and transport, would be lower and recover more&#13;
slowly than in the baseline. Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s growth performance would be weaker than in the baseline&#13;
scenario, though driven by the same economic dynamics described above. Recovery of domestic&#13;
demand, both consumption and investment, will be slower than in the baseline. Under the low case&#13;
scenario GDP growth would slow to about 1 percent in 2015 and 0.7 percent in 2016, before rising&#13;
to 2.1 percent as production at the Kashagan oilfield commences. This outcome would translate into&#13;
slower improvement in external and fiscal positions. In such a case, the government may wish to&#13;
consider using the anti-cyclical and targeted rules of the oil fund to provide economic support to the&#13;
economy through expansion of targeted social protection as well as investment in critical&#13;
infrastructure. Total government debt would remain higher in the medium term than in the baseline,&#13;
&#13;
16|&#13;
&amp;#12;though it would remain stable and sustainable and ultimately decline over the longer term. Assuming&#13;
oil price of US$40 per barrel would magnify the downside risk that Kashagan production could be&#13;
postponed, slowing the economic recovery. In a context of low growth, and barring any new negative&#13;
external shocks (global food- or further oil-price shocks), price inflation would slow to an average of&#13;
about 4 percent in 2017.&#13;

F.       Focus Section: Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to&#13;
         Kazakhstan14&#13;
The government of Kazakhstan has expressed a strong interest in attracting more FDI to the country&#13;
in a bid to improve productivity and competitiveness in the nonoil economy though the transfer of skills&#13;
and technology. This effort is accompanied by a renewed emphasis on value-chain and cluster&#13;
development as part of the SPIID 2015-2019 industrialization program. This focus section examines&#13;
recent trends in FDI in Kazakhstan, focusing on four key questions. What types of investment has&#13;
Kazakhstan attracted? What benefits can FDI offer Kazakhstan? What types of investment should the&#13;
country focus on attracting? And what can it do to attract its preferred types of investment?&#13;
&#13;
     1. What kind of investment has Kazakhstan attracted?&#13;
&#13;
A strong upward trend in gross FDI flows over the past decade&#13;
&#13;
Since the early 2000s FDI flows into Kazakhstan have been growing on a steady upward&#13;
trend, but with sharp short-term fluctuations since the 2008 financial crisis.15 Overall, it has&#13;

Whyte, Harald Jedlicka, Persephone Economou and Ekaterina Kniga (World Bank Group).&#13;
15 Such a pattern is not unusual for resource-based economies, since foreign investment projects in the extractive sectors&#13;
&#13;
tend to be large, with the bulk of investment typically occurring in a single year.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     |17&#13;
&amp;#12;performed consistently better than the overall average for the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region&#13;
in terms of the ratio of FDI flows to GDP.16 Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s inward FDI stock, an indicator of the size of&#13;
international production present in the country, was valued at US$ 120 billion at the end of 2012.&#13;

 Source: World Bank Group. In 2010, the dip in Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s net FDI inflows is related to domestic investors acquiring&#13;
 domestic assets from foreign investors in the oil sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FDI inflows are heavily concentrated in extractives industries and related services&#13;
&#13;
According to the National Bank of Kazakhstan about one-third of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s FDI inflows&#13;
in 2013 were focused on the primary sector (oil, mining and agriculture), with another third&#13;
invested in professional and technical services, many of which are involved in the extractive&#13;
industries (Figure 12). The high share of investments in the latter may be explained by the&#13;
central role that a range of business services, such as engineering activities, technical testing and&#13;
analysis activities and geological exploration and prospecting activities, play in supporting&#13;
activities in the primary sector. FDI in wholesale trade was also principally geared towards&#13;
supporting the primary sector. The manufacturing sector received only about a tenth of all FDI&#13;
inflows, and these investments were heavily concentrated in basic metals and fabricated metal&#13;
products, with much more modest investments in food, beverages and tobacco products.&#13;
Construction, information and communications technology, and financial services each accounted&#13;
for a small share of FDI inflows.&#13;

16 For several years Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s FDI-to-GDP ratio was more than three times the regional average. Kazakhstan&#13;
outperformed Russia, Europe and Central Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest nominal recipient of FDI inflows, yet it has lagged behind some of&#13;
the regionâ&#128;&#153;s smaller resource-based economies, including Mongolia, the Kyrgyz Republic and Turkmenistan.&#13;
&#13;
18|&#13;
&amp;#12;The European Union is Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s main source of FDI, but Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s share is growing&#13;
fast&#13;
The composition of gross FDI inflows17 in Kazakhstan over the 2005-2013 period&#13;
underscores the importance of the EU member states as a source of investment. However,&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s share of Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s FDI inflows increased from 2 percent in 2007 to 9 percent in 2013,&#13;
while Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s share remained largely unchanged over the period, accounting for 5 percent of gross&#13;
FDI inflows in 2013. The geographical distribution of FDI stocks displays a similar pattern (Figure&#13;
13).&#13;
&#13;
FDI in Kazakhstan has not achieving its full economic potential yet&#13;
&#13;
Reinvested earnings constitute an unusually small share of gross FDI inflows in Kazakhstan,&#13;
averaging just 10 percent during 2005-2014, though in 2014 this share increased to 22&#13;
percent. In developing countries reinvested earnings typically represent between a quarter and a&#13;
third of inbound FDI. Low ratios of reinvested earnings imply that profits are typically repatriated&#13;
rather than retained for reinvestment and expansion. This, in turn, may indicate challenges in&#13;
retaining existing foreign investors or that foreign investors face weak incentives to remain in the&#13;
country and expand their operations.&#13;

The role of FDI in job creation varies considerably by sector. Foreign companies registered in&#13;
Kazakhstan account for roughly 7 percent of total employment, or about 238,000 jobs.18 Foreign&#13;
firms employ a full 27 percent of workers in the mining sector. In manufacturing, foreign firms&#13;
account for 17 percent of employment on average, while in professional, financial and business&#13;
services the share of foreign firms in total employment is 17, 13 and 16 percent, respectively. The&#13;
&#13;
17 According to the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s definition gross FDI inflows include increases of equity (i.e. purchases of at least 10&#13;
percent of the voting shares in Kazakhstani firms by non-residents or purchases of real estate in Kazakhstan by non-&#13;
residents), reinvested earnings (i.e. the share of foreign direct investors in undistributed income, or losses, by Kazakhstani&#13;
firms), and increases in debt instruments (i.e. the flow of funds from foreign direct investors, both in cash and in kind,&#13;
without amortization).&#13;
18 Domestic private companies accounted for an estimated 54 percent and state-owned enterprises for 39 percent.&#13;

       2. What benefits and drawbacks can FDI bring to a host country?&#13;
&#13;
FDI can bring a host of potential benefits to a country. In addition to job creation, FDI can add to&#13;
capital stock, promote research and development and transfer of new â&#128;&#147; and potentially greener and&#13;
cleaner-technology, facilitate the adoption of enhanced management techniques, build workforce&#13;
skills, contribute to additional tax revenues, encourage competition and expand exports (Figure 15).&#13;
Empirical studies have concluded that FDI contributes to increased total factor productivity and&#13;
higher incomes in recipient countries to a greater extent than domestic investment. However, the&#13;
magnitude of this effect is difficult to quantify.&#13;
&#13;
Yet despite its considerable economic potential the international experience suggests that FDI&#13;
can also have significant drawbacks for recipient countries. These include the deterioration of&#13;
the balance of payments as profits are repatriated (though this is often offset by new incoming FDI),&#13;
a lack of positive linkages with local firms and the domestic labor market, potentially negative&#13;
environmental impacts (especially in the extractive and heavy industries), social disruptions&#13;
associated with accelerated commercialization, the effects of additional competition in domestic&#13;
markets, or even undue influence by foreign firms in the domestic political process. The net impact&#13;
of FDI depends on the policy environment of the host countryâ&#128;&#148;its capacity to administer FDI inflows,&#13;
regulate the activities of foreign firms, and monitor the effects of foreign investment. The relative&#13;
sophistication of the domestic economy is also a key factor, as it conditions the extent to which the&#13;
economy is able to absorb the benefits of capital accumulation and technology transfer.19&#13;
&#13;
       3. What kind of investment needs to be attracted?&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening the policy framework could help to attract and retain high-quality FDI&#13;
&#13;
Kazakhstan has traditionally mostly attracted resource-seeking FDI and some market-&#13;
seeking FDI, but little efficiency seeking investment. Resource seeking FDI is investment in&#13;
natural resources. Market seeking FDI is investment provides goods and services to the domestic&#13;
market. Efficiency-seeking FDI strives to take advantage of domestic economic assets to increase the&#13;
productive efficiency of export-oriented goods or services. It is estimated that a mere 11 percent of&#13;
Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s total inbound FDI from 2005 through 2014 was efficiency-seeking. This helps explain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19   OECD, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
20|&#13;
&amp;#12;the countryâ&#128;&#153;s narrow export mix and the generally weak integration of Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s firms into&#13;
regional and global value chains.&#13;
&#13;
Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s experience with FDI is similar to that of other countries in the Commonwealth&#13;
of Independent States (CIS). A recent study on FDI in CIS countries found that the choice of location&#13;
always depends on a preliminary analysis of national macroeconomic advantages and disadvantages.&#13;
Relevant factors include the existing FDI stock, the size of the domestic market, the availability of&#13;
natural resources, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal stance and the inflation rate. These conditions can predict&#13;
the type of FDI (resource-seeking, market seeking, or efficiency-seeking) attracted by a given&#13;
country.20&#13;
&#13;
Leveraging FDI to promote diversification and employment growth in Kazakhstan will require&#13;
attracting greater volumes of market-seeking FDI and especially efficiency-seeking FDI.&#13;
Efficiency-seeking investment has the most transformative potential of any type of foreign&#13;
investment, with its ability to transfer technology and skills and spur diversification by increasing&#13;
linkages with regional and global value chains. This type of FDI can have a powerful impact on&#13;
exports, introducing domestic producers to new foreign markets and allowing domestic workers to&#13;
increase their productivity. Efficiency-seeking investment takes advantage of lower labor costs,&#13;
higher labor productivity, easier or even preferential access to export markets, access to key inputs&#13;
and components, more efficient international production and supply patterns, or other factors that&#13;
improve firm-level competitiveness.&#13;

     4. Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s challenge: How to better attract and retain FDI in non-mineral sectors?&#13;
&#13;
The international experience suggests that successfully attracting and retaining FDI requires&#13;
that recipient countries offer an attractive policy framework as well as specific investment&#13;
incentives and services. An accommodative policy framework includes a stable macro-fiscal&#13;

&amp;#12;environment, a sound monetary policy and substantial trade openness. In addition, the government&#13;
must make sustained efforts to address regulatory, governance and corruption issues to improve&#13;
the business environment. In some cases the authorities should take steps to reduce the role of the&#13;
public sector in the economy, ease restrictions on capital flows, expatriate labor or foreign&#13;
ownership of land or other assets, reduce the extent of price controls, or alleviate burdensome tax&#13;
policies and administrative requirements.21 In addition to these general measures, specific policies&#13;
to attract FDI need to be well aligned with the countryâ&#128;&#153;s global and sectoral development objectives.&#13;
Evidence from selected countries suggests that providing services that directly address problems&#13;
faced by investorsâ&#128;&#148;such as regulatory, financing or taxation issuesâ&#128;&#148;can effectively attract FDI.&#13;
Investment grants, e.g. for research or worker training, may appeal to foreign investors interested&#13;
in greenfield FDI or regional investment projects.22&#13;
&#13;
Attracting and retaining market- or efficiency-seeking investment would require systematic&#13;
and targeted investment-promotion efforts. Developing a national FDI strategy would help&#13;
define Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s global and sectoral approach to foreign investment and provide a framework&#13;
for coordination among the different government ministries and agencies involved in attracting and&#13;
retaining FDI. Such a strategy should clearly identify the types of investors the government is&#13;
targeting and the most appropriate approaches for attracting the desired form of FDI.23 A&#13;
corresponding FDI marketing strategy would help attract foreign investors to selected sectors.&#13;
Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s FDI-related legislation must be consistent with its international commitments and&#13;
limit the countryâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to potential disputes between investors and the government. The&#13;
package of incentives offered to domestic and foreign investors should be rationalized and aligned&#13;
with Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#153;s sectoral priorities and development objectives. The incentives themselves should&#13;
reflect the international experience with attracting different types of FDI (Table 7), and information&#13;
on investment incentives should be widely publicized. The recent establishment of an Investment&#13;
Ombudsman Office at the Ministry of Investment and Development has the potential to effectively&#13;
address investor grievances and prevent them from escalating. Finally, the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity&#13;
to undertake analytical and policy analysis could be strengthened to conduct rigorous empirical and&#13;
qualitative policy analysis on the contribution of FDI to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy and to develop a&#13;
comprehensive framework for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), including a system of performance&#13;
indicators for FDIs.&#13;

23 The typology of FDI includes: natural resource-seeking investment, market-seeking investment, efficiency-seeking&#13;
&#13;
investment, and strategic asset-seeking investment. Each type is motivated by different factors (e.g. existence of natural&#13;
resources; labor productivity and market access; availability of raw materials; etc.). Each offers different benefits; for&#13;
example, efficiency-seeking investment tends to be more conducive to the creation of high-quality employment&#13;
opportunities than natural resource-seeking investment. Attracting each specific type of investment requires a different&#13;
approach.&#13;

            Kazakhstan : adjusting to lower oil prices;
            challenging times ahead - biannual economic update (Fall 2015)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kazakhstan’s economy faces the challenge
            of adjusting to a large terms-of-trade shock in a context of
            declining domestic and external demand. The authorities
            responded to the collapse of global oil prices through a
            rapid fiscal adjustment followed by corresponding monetary
            and exchange-rate policy adjustments. A difficult external
            environment will continue to affect Kazakhstan’s medium-term
            outlook. In the medium term, the economy continues to face
            significant downside risks, including the possibility of
            delays in Kashagan offshore oil production or a protracted
            recession in Russia and a further slowdown in China. Over
            the longer term, diversification of the economy will be
            required to increase its resilience to external shocks.
