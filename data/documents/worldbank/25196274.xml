&amp;#12;Disclaimer&#13;
&#13;
The Scope of this assessment included social risks of the Program, more specifically the risks&#13;
related to potential reduction of the workforce in the public sector due to technological, economic&#13;
or organizational changes which could be associated to Improvement of Human Resources&#13;
Management Component of the Program. Potential environmental risks are minor and would be&#13;
only related to occupational health and safety risks during office refurbishment activities.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment was carried out by the World Bank (WB) early in the project preparation phase&#13;
and prior to the Concept Note Review meeting at the WB. At the moment of the assessment the&#13;
potential number or location of potentially affected people by workforce reduction were not&#13;
known. Therefore the assessment focused on the systems in place to manage labor relations and&#13;
retrenchment. This assessment is conducted for decision-making purposes and does not constitute&#13;
a comprehensive analysis of the issues, but rather a rapid due diligence on potential high risks and&#13;
impacts associated to the Program.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the implementation of the newly adopted Law on the Maximum Number of&#13;
Employees in the Public Sector, the first reductions of the workforce might happen by the end of&#13;
2015. However, these retrenchments will be outside of the scope of World Bank financed Program.&#13;
The Programâ&#128;&#153;s impacts may occur between the year 2016 and 2018.&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
Context and Objectives&#13;
1. An Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) has been prepared for the&#13;
World Bank's Modernization and Optimization of Public Administration to be financed&#13;
under a Program for Results operation (PforR) in the Republic of Serbia. The ESSA examines&#13;
environmental and social management systems that are applicable to the program in order to assess&#13;
their compliance with the Bank Policy Program-for-Results Financing. It aims to ensure that the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social risks will be managed adequately and that it complies with&#13;
the basic principles of sustainable development. Paragraph 8 of OP 9.00 describes the core&#13;
principles of environmental and social management that must be met in the ESSA. These core&#13;
principles are as follows:&#13;
Environmental Management Systems&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Promote environmental and social sustainability in the program design, avoid, minimize or&#13;
       mitigate against adverse impacts, and promote informed decision making relating to a&#13;
       programâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social effects.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse impacts resulting on natural habitats and physical and&#13;
       cultural resources resulting from the program.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Protect public safety and the safety of workers against the potential risks associated with:&#13;
       (i) construction and/or operation of facilities or other business practices in the program, (ii)&#13;
       exposure to toxic chemicals, hazardous wastes and other dangerous goods under the&#13;
       program; (iii) reconstruction or rehabilitation of infrastructure in areas prone to natural&#13;
       hazards.&#13;
Social Management Systems&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Manage land acquisition and loss of access to natural resources in a way that avoids or&#13;
       minimizes displacement, and assist the affected people in improving or at the minimum&#13;
       restoring, their livelihoods and living standards.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Give due consideration to the cultural appropriateness of, and equitable access to, program&#13;
       benefits, giving special attention to the rights and interests of the Indigenous Peoples and&#13;
       to the needs or concerns of vulnerable groups.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Avoid exacerbating social conflict, especially in fragile states, post-conflict areas, or areas&#13;
       subject to territorial disputes.&#13;
&#13;
2. The ESSA evaluates the compatibility of the programâ&#128;&#153;s systems with the core principles&#13;
on two basic levels: (i) the systems as defined by laws, regulations, procedures, etc. (the "system&#13;
as defined"); and (ii) the institutional capacity of implementation entities under the program to&#13;
effectively implement the system (the "system as it is applied in practice"). It identifies and&#13;
analyzes the differences between the national systems and the core principles that apply to the&#13;
program on the two levels indicated above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;ESSA Approach&#13;
3. The preparation of the draft ESSA and the development of measures to strengthen the&#13;
environmental and social management system has benefited from various inputs,&#13;
information and an informal consultation process, including:&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Review: the review focused on legislation and current labor regulations, relevant reports&#13;
       related to labor issues (e.g.: Employment and Social Reform Program; Statistical Office&#13;
       data ), and on separate specific reports of other World Bank projects related to employment&#13;
       issues.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Initial consultation meetings: to develop a better understanding of procedures, standards&#13;
       and approach for this project, meetings took place with the technical staff in the ministries&#13;
       and other government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Administration and Local-&#13;
       Self Government, the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs, the&#13;
       National Employment Service, the Socio-Economic Council, the Social Inclusion Unit, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Institutions, roles, responsibilities and coordination&#13;
4. To ensure proper implementation of the Program, an institutional arrangement will be&#13;
established and will include the following structures:&#13;
   -   Ministry of Public Administration and Local - Self Government (MPALSG), as the&#13;
       implementation agency of the program;&#13;
   -   Ministry of Finance as the reviewer in the process of establishing of the maximum number&#13;
       of employees in the public sector;&#13;
   -   The National Employment Service (NES) will be responsible for providing unemployment&#13;
       benefits, and active employment measures to the retrenched workers.&#13;
&#13;
5. The MPALSG will be the implementing agency of the program. Consistent with the Action&#13;
Plan for Implementation of Public Administration Strategy, the MPALSG will also be responsible&#13;
for coordinating the monitoring and reporting of the Programâ&#128;&#153;s result framework, including the&#13;
Disbursement Linked Indicators and the Program Action Plan. The MPALSG will be responsible&#13;
for transfers of payments for severance payments to other ministries and public sector entities who&#13;
identified need for targeted staff reductions in accordance with the Law on the Maximum Number&#13;
of Employees. It will also be responsible for preparing the programâ&#128;&#153;s financial reports, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation drawing if necessary, on financial reports from other ministries and&#13;
agencies involved in the Program.&#13;
&#13;
Main Components and Program Activities&#13;
6. The World Bank will support the implementation of the Public Administration Reform&#13;
(PAR) Strategy of the Republic of Serbia through the Modernization and Optimization of&#13;
the Public Administration PforR operation. The Program would support two out of the five&#13;
areas of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Public Administration Strategy, namely:&#13;
human resource management and public finances, by providing:&#13;
   -   Improved human resources management&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;   -   Improved procurement management&#13;
   -   Improved financial management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Program Environmental and Social Risks&#13;
&#13;
Main Social Risks&#13;
7. In general, the most significant social impacts that are likely to be observed in the context&#13;
of improving the public administration efficiency are related to potential retrenchment of&#13;
the public sector employees, which could be associated to the Improvement of Human&#13;
Resources Management Component of the Program. Targeted workforce reductions including&#13;
retirement, voluntary termination of employment and retrenchment of the public sector employees&#13;
must comply with the applicable Labor Law, Law on the Maximum Number of Employees in the&#13;
Public Sector, Civil Servants Law and applicable collective agreements for respective sectors (eg.&#13;
state bodies, health, education, etc).&#13;
8. The right to work is a fundamental right defined and guaranteed by the Constitution of&#13;
the Republic of Serbia, Article 60: Right to work shall be guaranteed in accordance with the&#13;
law. Everyone shall have the right to choose his occupation freely. All work places shall be&#13;
available to everyone under equal conditions. Everyone shall have the right to respect of his person&#13;
at work, safe and healthy working conditions, necessary protection at work, limited working hours,&#13;
daily and weekly interval for rest, paid annual holiday, fair remuneration for work done and legal&#13;
protection in case of termination of working relations. No person may forgo these rights. Women,&#13;
young and disabled persons shall be provided with special protection at work and special work&#13;
conditions in accordance with the law.&#13;
9. Negative social impacts associated with potential retrenchment under the Program will be&#13;
limited in time, from 2016 â&#128;&#147; 2018. This is due to the effectiveness of the Law on the Maximum&#13;
Number of Employees in the Public Sector (until the end of calendar year 2018) and the Stand by&#13;
Agreement with the IMF in relation to the fiscal consolidation measures. It is likely that significant&#13;
portion of the workforce reductions will be implemented though the natural attrition (retirement)&#13;
and hiring freeze measures.&#13;
10. Relevant labor legal acts and collective agreements include provisions on redundancy&#13;
due to technological, economic or organizational changes and provide rights to workers. The&#13;
legal framework provides special protections for pregnant women, women on maternity leave,&#13;
mothers of children under age of two years, persons with disabilities, and persons on disability&#13;
leave (temporary absence for illness). The redundant workers have a right to redundancy&#13;
(severance) payment, unemployment benefits, and access to health insurance. The labor legislation&#13;
requires employer to prepare a retrenchment plan and consult with relevant unions (worker&#13;
organizations) in regard to the proposed retrenchment plan.&#13;
11. While the nature of proposed activities of the Program, does not suggest that specific&#13;
vulnerable groups could be harmed under the Program, it should be noted that in many&#13;
sectors of the public administration and public services women comprise the majority of the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;employees. This is especially the case in the education and health sectors. Therefore, potential&#13;
reductions of the workforce may affect women in a higher degree.&#13;
12. Ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities are employees in the public sector. The&#13;
Law on The Maximum Number of Employees in the Public Sector gives a special consideration&#13;
in the protection of persons with disabilities and persons with the knowledge of language of ethnic&#13;
minorities.&#13;
13. The Program will not involve any large civil works, therefore land acquisition or&#13;
resettlement are not expected to take place under the Program.&#13;
14. Serbia is not considered as a fragile state, or a post-conflict zone. Therefore, this social&#13;
issue is not applicable to the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Main Environmental Risks&#13;
15. The Program is not expected to cause major environmental impacts. The change in&#13;
organizational and functional structure of the departments and potential modernization of HR&#13;
information system might lead to minor civil works in the administrative buildings such as&#13;
remodeling, removal of partitions, walls plastering, provision of IT equipment, creation of server&#13;
rooms, etc. Environmental impacts related to above-mentioned activities might include dust,&#13;
noise, vibration, generation of non-hazardous construction waste and other occupational health&#13;
and safety concerns. These impacts are minor, site-specific, very limited in duration, and can be&#13;
adequately managed by the means of health and safety precautions. Therefore, the Program does&#13;
not require preparation of an extensive environmental systems assessment. Serbia has a relatively&#13;
strong regulatory and institutional framework to manage occupational health and safety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social Systems Assessment&#13;
16. Serbia has in place relatively well developed policy and legal framework on labor&#13;
relations and retrenchment along with an institutional system which is generally adequate .&#13;
The national legal framework is generally in line with international standards. Serbia ratified the&#13;
ILO Termination of Employment Convention No. 158. In general, the legal framework is&#13;
consistent with principles of the IFC Performance Standards 2 â&#128;&#147; Labor and Working Conditions,&#13;
(paragraphs 18. â&#128;&#147; 19. on retrenchment). The identified gaps are related to the implementation of&#13;
consultation with workers, and to monitoring and evaluation of the retrenchment process.&#13;
17. The existing labor legislation provides adequate protection of workers in instances when&#13;
due to technological, economic or organizational changes a particular job becomes&#13;
redundant or volume of work would be reduced. Labor legal acts provide for considering&#13;
alternatives to termination of employment including hiring freeze, enforcement of retirement ages,&#13;
outsourcing of particular activities (example, in health), internal transfers and redeployment, and&#13;
reduction in salaries. Some of these measures such as natural attrition through retirement, hiring&#13;
freeze, and reduction in salaries have already been implemented in the public sector in 2014 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;2015 as a part of the package of measures to reduce government spending and increase fiscal&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
18. The Labor Law requires that the employer prepare a retrenchment plan. The respective&#13;
union and National Employment Service are to provide their opinion on the proposed plan. Legal&#13;
acts and specific collective agreements that apply to the employees in the public sector, stipulate&#13;
for selection criteria and principles when termination of employment occurs as a consequence of&#13;
changes in program, organization or structure of work. The selection criteria are grounded on the&#13;
non-discrimination principles, which are in line with good international practice. These provisions&#13;
specifically protect employees from being retrenched due to a membership in a union, pregnancy,&#13;
maternity leave, disability leave, child care leave, personal disability, national and social origin,&#13;
and other personal characteristics. The collective agreements provide protection for mothers of&#13;
children of age less than 2 years and single headed households with under-aged children.&#13;
19. Laws and collective agreements provide provisions for redundancy (severance) payments&#13;
and formulas for its calculation. The redundancy payment is calculated on the basis of 30% of&#13;
average monthly salary prior to retrenchment, for every year of service with the employer. The&#13;
retrenched employees have a right to unemployment benefits, health care and pension insurance.&#13;
While these legal provisions are in accordance with good practice, the experience of large&#13;
retrenchments in the past, due to privatization of large state owned enterprises indicate that there&#13;
is a reason for caution. These benefits are provided for a limited period of time. In an environment&#13;
with high unemployment rate and lack of job supply, it would be unrealistic to assume that majority&#13;
of retrenched people would find new employment easily.&#13;
20. The Labor Law and applicable collective agreements require consultations with unions&#13;
related to the retrenchment program. However, it seems that in practice there are cases when&#13;
such consultations occur to a lesser degree, i.e. consultations with workers are not systematically&#13;
observed. The Law on the Maximum Number of Employees, which serves as an instrument for&#13;
the rightsizing in the public sector, was adopted under an urgent parliamentary procedure and&#13;
therefore, it was not a subject to public consultations. The unions and the Socio-Economic Council&#13;
issued their public statements to express their dissatisfaction with lack of consultation and their&#13;
inputs.&#13;
21. It should be noted that relevant laws do not include specific requirements for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of retrenchment programs and status of retrenched employees. There are no&#13;
requirements for the employers to follow the situation of the retrenched workers or outcomes of&#13;
assistance provided. Once the labor relations are terminated, the National Employment Service&#13;
(NES) tracks and follows the status of retrenched workers, who decide to register with NES.&#13;
22. In general, the legal framework for the protection of the retrenched workers is broadly&#13;
in place, but its consistent implementation across the country needs to be ensured, notably in&#13;
the areas of consultations with workers (unions), transparent retrenchment criteria and follow up&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the status of affected workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;Environmental and Social Systems Assessment Action Plan&#13;
Social Systems Action Plan related to retrenchment&#13;
23. Although the overall economic impacts of the Program are expected to be positive, there&#13;
could also be some adverse social impacts associated to the retrenchment of workers in public&#13;
entities, which represents a reputational and technical risk for the Program, the Government&#13;
and the World Bank. The Program provides an opportunity to strengthen the procedures to&#13;
identify and mitigate any adverse effects associated to retrenchment in accordance with&#13;
internationally recognized practices.&#13;
24. On the technical side, to fill the gaps between the existing social management system and&#13;
international good practice identified through this social systems assessment, the program&#13;
will support specific measures to enhance performance of the social management system&#13;
related to retrenchment. These measures will be implemented on the basis of the following&#13;
actions:&#13;
1) Prepare clear guidelines to implement the Article 7. of the Law on the Maximum number of&#13;
Employees in the Public Sector. MPALSG as the coordinator of the PAR reform and the rightsizing&#13;
process, will prepare guidelines for the other ministries on how to carry out the strategic and&#13;
functional analysis in a way that minimizes adverse social impacts and based on the principles of&#13;
fairness and transparency. The guidelines will be prepared by November 30, 2015.&#13;
2) Ensure that the Change Management Unit within MPALSG has staff assigned to coordinate,&#13;
monitor and report on the rightsizing process and its effects. By the start of the Program, the&#13;
MPALSG to assign two staff members with relevant competences and experience (knowledge of&#13;
human resources and labor relations procedures) to coordinate the rightsizing process with other&#13;
public sector entities, and to provide regular periodic reports on the status of actions from this&#13;
Program Action Plan.&#13;
3) Improve consultations with workers and workers organizations (unions): At the level of each&#13;
employer in the public sector, prepare the consultation plan and document that the unions or worker&#13;
representatives were consulted in relation to retrenchment and respective retrenchment plans. Each&#13;
public entity submitting the request for redundancy payment to the MPALSG to attach minutes&#13;
from the consultations or written comments by the unions (workersâ&#128;&#153; representatives) on the&#13;
retrenchment plan. If requested, a sample of these reports would be submitted to the World Bank&#13;
for review.&#13;
4) Selection Criteria: The criteria for selection of employees who will be made redundant will be:&#13;
transparent, non-discriminatory, applied consistently and contain appeal procedure. The criteria&#13;
will be consistent with provisions in the applicable national labor legislation and collective&#13;
agreements, and reinforce protections of following categories of workers: pregnant women,&#13;
women on maternity leave, single parents, women headed households, mothers of children under&#13;
the age of two, employees on disability leave, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and&#13;
households where both providers are employed in the public sector. Every employer who will&#13;
reduce its workforce will make the criteria for retrenchment publically available on its bulletin&#13;
board. The retrenchment criteria and the rationale will be included in the retrenchment plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;5) Retrenchment plans: As required by the Labor Law, the employers in the public sector will&#13;
prepare retrenchment plans to document that requirements from the Labor Law, Civil Servants&#13;
Law and applicable collective agreements were respected. The Retrenchment Plan will include the&#13;
following elements:&#13;
     i.) rationale for determining the redundancy of employees;&#13;
     ii.) total number of employees with the respective employer;&#13;
     iii.) number of redundant employees, their qualifications and job positions, age, and length&#13;
     of employment (years) covered by the employment insurance benefits; gender segregated&#13;
     information (number of males and females), number of persons with disabilities.&#13;
     iv.) selection criteria for determining redundant employees;&#13;
     v.) measures for alternative employment such as: transfer to other jobs; transfer to other&#13;
     employer; training; part-time work, but not less than 50% of the full time and other measures;&#13;
     vi.) resources to address the socio-economic status of the redundant employees;&#13;
     vii.) employment termination deadline.&#13;
The proposed draft retrenchment plan will be submitted to the relevant workersâ&#128;&#153; representatives&#13;
or union, and the National Employment Service for consultation. The period of advance notice and&#13;
the length of consultation must follow the provisions from the Labor Law. The consultations will&#13;
be documented in writing.&#13;
6) Transition assistance to retrenched employees: The MPALSG will agree with the Ministry of&#13;
Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs to include in the 2016 performance agreement with the&#13;
National Employment Service (NES) a requirement that (i) NES representative visits every entity&#13;
that will retrench more than 10 workers and inform workers about available NES services,&#13;
programs, and benefits, register them with NES, and develop an individual action plan for each&#13;
registered redundant worker; (ii) to contact at least 20 employers in the same and neighboring&#13;
municipalities where the public entity resides to offer them NES services and inquire about job&#13;
vacancies; and (iii) to consult with the local employment council about support for redundant&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
7) Gender and social inclusion â&#128;&#147; The MPALSG and the Statutory Health Insurance Fund will&#13;
request that submitted retrenchment plans and requests for redundancy (severance) payment&#13;
include segregated information according to gender (number of males/females), persons with&#13;
disabilities (number), ethnic minority (number).&#13;
8) Monitoring of redundancy (severance) payment disbursement and status of retrenched workers&#13;
â&#128;&#147; The MPALSG will monitor and report annually on the number of workers who received the&#13;
severance (redundancy) payment, as prescribed in the Law on the Maximum Number of&#13;
Employees in the Public Sector. NES will monitor and report annually on the status of retrenched&#13;
workers in terms of: a) number of retrenched workers (number of male/female) who received&#13;
active employment services from NES; and b) number of retrenched workers (number of&#13;
male/female) who found new employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 9&#13;
&amp;#12;Environmental Systems Assessment Action Plan&#13;
25. The Program is not expected to cause major environmental concerns. Potential impacts&#13;
are related to occupational health and safety issues during potential minor office refurbishment&#13;
operations.&#13;
26. Serbia has a relatively strong regulatory and institutional framework to manage&#13;
occupational health and safety. In order to strengthen mitigation of potential health and safety&#13;
risks the following is recommended:&#13;
1) Appoint a licensed person in charge of occupational health and safety issues, as stipulated in&#13;
the Occupational Safety and Health Law, as a pre-requisite to refurbishment activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;1. INTRODCUTION&#13;
1.1 Background and Context&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, Serbia has faced significant fiscal challenges. Since 2008, economic growth has&#13;
stalled, reversing the progress made in earlier years. Average real growth dropped to zero between&#13;
2009 and 2014. Fiscal deficits have averaged 6 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2014. As a&#13;
result, Serbiaâ&#128;&#153;s public debt has more than doubled â&#128;&#147; from 34 percent of GDP in 2008 to 71 percent&#13;
at end-2014. The unemployment rate grew from 14,4% in 2008 to 24,6% in 2012. By 2014, the&#13;
employment showed signs of slight recovery and reached 19,7% rate. In addition to other structural&#13;
issues such as subsidies and guarantees to public utilities and high levels of public employment,&#13;
inefficient human resource management and weaknesses in financial management have also&#13;
directly contributed to Serbiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal challenges.&#13;
&#13;
In an effort to deal with its fiscal challenges, in 2014 the Government of Serbia adopted an&#13;
ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reform program. The program is underpinned by a&#13;
three year Precautionary Stand-By Agreement with the IMF, approved by the IMF Board in&#13;
February 2015. In the short term, the program focuses on the control of aggregate wage and&#13;
pension expenditures, improvements in tax administration, and reductions in subsidies to state&#13;
owned enterprises. As part of the fiscal consolidation measures, salaries in the public sector and&#13;
pensions were reduced by 10% in 2014. Hiring freeze in the public sector was enforced as well.&#13;
The Government has also begun to address longer term structural problems in the administration&#13;
of the public sector, focusing on functional reviews and organizational restructuring to create&#13;
opportunities for efficiency gains. The fiscal consolidation and structural reform program aims to&#13;
create environment for sustainable growth and job creation in the medium term.&#13;
&#13;
In the context of fiscal consolidation and reducing public debt, the Government is undertaking a&#13;
public administration reform. The Public Administration Reform (PAR) Strategy, adopted in 2014&#13;
is supported by the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Public Sector Reform Strategy 2015-&#13;
2017. The PAR Strategy and Action Plan prioritize improvement of the organizational and&#13;
functioning of the public administration systems; strengthening of human resource management;&#13;
improvement of public finance and public procurement management, as well as enhancement of&#13;
legal certainty and improvement of business environment and quality of public services; increased&#13;
transparency and enhancement of ethical standards and strengthening the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s supervision&#13;
capacities.&#13;
&#13;
2. Program Description&#13;
2.1. Program&#13;
&#13;
The Government of the Republic of Serbia and the World Bank are currently engaged in the&#13;
preparation and development of a new operation (hereinafter Program) with an aim to improve&#13;
efficiency in public sector employment and finances.&#13;
&#13;
The Program is focused on a subset of priorities in the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s PAR aimed at addressing key&#13;
efficiency bottlenecks in the public sector employment and public finance. In particular, the Program&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;proposes to support three main areas (a) improving human resources management; (b) improving&#13;
public procurement management; (c) improving financial management.&#13;
&#13;
This social systems assessment is concerned with the first area of Program support, namely the&#13;
Programâ&#128;&#153;s support to implementing Government led changes in human resources management.&#13;
&#13;
2.2. Scope of the Program&#13;
&#13;
The Program activities will cover the entire territory of the Republican of Serbia - 29&#13;
administrative districts. Public sector institutions, municipalities, public service delivery&#13;
organizations and other organizational entities in the system of the public sector (excluding public&#13;
enterprises) across the country are subject of the PAR. As of December 2014, the Serbian public&#13;
sector (excluding public enterprises) employed 491,133 staff under permanent and fixed-term&#13;
contracts. The Table 1. offers an overview of employment numbers per sector.&#13;

&#13;
2.3. Beneficiaries of the Program&#13;
&#13;
The end beneficiaries are the citizens of the Republic of Serbia â&#128;&#147; approximately 7 million citizens.&#13;
The general objective of the public administration reform is to provide a high quality service to the&#13;
citizens and business entities. In the long term the objective is to create a public administration that&#13;
will contribute to the economic stability and improvement of the living standards of citizens,&#13;
therefore contributing to long term sustainability. The citizens will benefit from enhanced provision&#13;
of public services, in a more efficient and more effective fashion. The more efficient public sector&#13;
can create savings that can contribute to the improved business enabling environment and job&#13;
creation.&#13;
&#13;
2.4. Anticipated Environmental and Social Impacts of the Program&#13;
&#13;
2.4.1 Main Social Risks of the Program&#13;
The overall objective of Program financed activities is to improve efficiency in public sector human&#13;
resources management and finances. The activities financed under the Program will not include any&#13;
civil works, which would require acquisition of land or relocation of people. The major social risk&#13;
identified is a risk of potential reduction of workforce in the public sector due to technological,&#13;
economic or organizational changes which could be associated to Improvement of Human&#13;
Resources Management Component of the Program.&#13;
The table below summarizes the risks related to social impacts of the Program as per OP 9.00.&#13;

                                                                                                                           13&#13;

    workforce        substantial. The program will include mitigation measures such as early&#13;
    reduction due    retirement, severance payment, unemployment benefits and assistance in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As stated earlier, the improvement of the efficiency in human resources management is a part of the&#13;
broader PAR agenda, underpinned by the fiscal consolidation efforts. To achieve fiscal&#13;
sustainability, the Government is looking to avoid pure linear 5% downsizing, and to carry out&#13;
broader reorganization of the public administration.1.&#13;
&#13;
There are two phases of the public sector reforms. The first phase of the rationalization (right-sizing)&#13;
reform is underway. As part of its fiscal consolidation agenda for 2015â&#128;&#147;17, as supported by the&#13;
IMF Stand By Agreement (SBA) program, the government has set out a series of fiscal structural&#13;
reforms, including measures to address the public wage bill. Besides continuing to apply the 5:1&#13;
attrition rule (for every 5 employees who retire, hire 1 new employee), the government will&#13;
implement targeted workforce reductions. All budget beneficiary entities have been asked to draft&#13;
a plan for reducing the number of employees. The Law on the Maximum Number of Employees&#13;
in the Public Sector was adopted in July 2015. This law regulates procedures for targeted&#13;
separations including early retirement and voluntary termination of employment. As a result of&#13;
the implementation of the newly adopted Law on the Maximum Number of Employees in the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;public sector, first reductions of the workforce will happen by the end of 2015. However, these&#13;
separations will be outside of the scope of World Bank financed Program. The WB supported&#13;
Programâ&#128;&#153;s impacts may occur between 2016 and 2018. At the moment of the preparation of this&#13;
assessment, the government has started considering measures that would reduce government&#13;
spending on processes and purchases, but would not necessarily lead to sharp reductions in the&#13;
workforce. It is understood that significant reductions of the workforce could lead to decreased&#13;
effectiveness of public services.&#13;
&#13;
The rightsizing process that was carried out by August of 2015 is summarized can be summarized&#13;
as following. The public sector in Serbia employees approximately 490, 000 people, working in&#13;
public admiration, municipalities, public services (eg. health, education) and communal services&#13;
(eg. waste management, water facilities, park maintenance, etc). Therefore, the assessments for&#13;
initial downsizing were carried out at the public entity level. In the period from late 2014 to the&#13;
August of 2015, the MPALSG carried out initial assessments for the rightsizing in coordination&#13;
with 17 other ministries and province administration bodies. At the level of each ministry there&#13;
was a 3 â&#128;&#147; 4 person team comprised of a person with a strategic role (for example, State Secretary&#13;
or Assistant Minister) and staff from human resources, legal or finance department. Each ministry&#13;
then worked with bodies and organizational entities in their respective sectors to prepare proposals&#13;
for downsizing. For example, in the sector of education, the directors of schools worked with their&#13;
teams to identify the redundant functions. The list of redundant functions at schools are publically&#13;
available of the website of the Ministry of Education and on the websites of unions in the education&#13;
sector. At the moment of preparation of this report, the government was still in the process of&#13;
determining which jobs would become redundant in 2015. The government has secured the budget&#13;
for severance payments for 2015 â&#128;&#147; RSD 5.5 billion (approximately USD 50 million).&#13;
&#13;
The second phase of the reforms will focus on restructuring and right-sizing the public sector. This&#13;
will begin with a comprehensive functional review of the central administration and the Ministry&#13;
of Finance. There will also be functional reviews of specific ministries, such as education, health,&#13;
social protection, and agriculture. Functional reviews have been used in many countries to identify&#13;
savings in a more strategic and targeted manner than across-the-board cuts. They are intended to&#13;
simplify administrative procedures, eliminate redundant tasks, and eliminate or restructure&#13;
departments with duplicate functions without compromising service delivery. They also include&#13;
changing the organizational structure, job definitions, and staffing levels to ensure that the&#13;
organizational and functional structure determines public staffing needs. The functional reviews&#13;
will not necessarily be limited to staff but will also consider other expenditure items and how&#13;
services are delivered. Other World Bank funded TA project is assisting the Ministry for Public&#13;
Administration and Local Self-Governance to carry out functional analysis of institutions in the&#13;
systems of public administration.&#13;
&#13;
According to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Public Finance Review (2015), the right-sizing reforms leading to&#13;
lay-offs are likely to have more direct impact on household incomes. Among the mitigation&#13;
measures are severance payments, to be determined based on current legislation. To the extent that&#13;
attrition is used, public employees may transition to pension status, limiting the impact on their&#13;
incomes from the separation. The ability of those who lose their jobs to find new employment will&#13;
depend on their education levels, skills, and age as well as geography. Although targeted workforce&#13;
reductions may have immediate adverse impacts for the employment and living standards of those&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;directly affected, government investment is expected to recover gradually and lead to job creation&#13;
in the mid-term.&#13;
&#13;
The potential retrenchment of the public sector employees is a reputational and technical risk for&#13;
the Program. During the preparation of this assessment, the Union of Health Care workers&#13;
submitted an appeal to the Constitutional Court on September 11, 2015, in order to review whether&#13;
the Law on the Maximum Number of Employees in the Public Sector is constitutional. The&#13;
Government has communicated on multiple occasions in the media that cost cutting in the public&#13;
sector is a necessary measure as a part of fiscal consolidation, which would eventually lead to&#13;
creating of an enabling environment for investments and job creation.&#13;
&#13;
This assessment will consider potential retrenchment from a technical point of view and assess the&#13;
adequacy of social management system to mitigate and manage this risk. At the moment of the&#13;
assessment the potential number or location of potentially affected people by workforce reduction&#13;
were not known, therefore the assessment focused on the systems in place associated to labor&#13;
relations and retrenchment management. The retrenchment mitigation measures will also consider&#13;
social inclusion aspects such as non-discrimination of certain groups (women, people with&#13;
disabilities, ethnic minorities).&#13;
&#13;
2.4.2. Main Environmental Risks of the Program&#13;
&#13;
The Program is not expected to cause major environmental concerns. The change in organizational&#13;
and functional structure of the departments and potential modernization of HR information system&#13;
might lead to minor civil works in the administrative buildings such as remodeling, removal of&#13;
partitions, walls plastering, provision of IT equipment, creation of server rooms etc.&#13;
Environmental impacts related to above-mentioned activities might include dust, noise, vibration,&#13;
generation of non-hazardous construction waste and other occupational health and safety concerns.&#13;
These impacts are minor, site-specific, short lived and can be adequately managed by the means&#13;
of health and safety mitigation measures. Therefore, the Program does not require preparation of&#13;
an extensive environmental systems assessment. Serbia has a relatively strong regulatory and&#13;
institutional framework to manage occupational health and safety.&#13;

2.5. Previous Experiences from Institutions involved in the Program&#13;
Institutions involved in the Program have a long history of collaboration with the World Bank.&#13;
The Government and the World Bank implemented several programs that involved the&#13;
retrenchment workers in the state owned enterprises. The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of&#13;
Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs and the National Employment Service have the&#13;
experience in implementing large retrenchment programs including social programs with&#13;
severance payments and designing Active Labor Market Programs. The government has secured&#13;
the resources for severance payment in the annual budget.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is supporting the Job and Competiveness project with the Ministry of Labor,&#13;
Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs. One of main components of the project is to enhance the&#13;
capacities of the National Employment Agency.&#13;
&#13;
2.6. Overview of the labor market in Serbia and national employment strategies&#13;
&#13;
According to government policy document â&#128;&#156;Program for reforms of employment and social policy&#13;
in the process of EU accessionâ&#128;&#157; (2015)2, general economic situation in recent years in Serbia is&#13;
characterized by two trends. One is economic growth by 2008, and another slowdown in growth&#13;
since 2008, when the Serbian economy in certain years also recorded a negative growth. Serbia&#13;
ended 2014 with an estimated real economic decline of 1.8%.&#13;
In terms of performance of the labor market Serbia is lagging behind the European Union because&#13;
the whole previous decade was marked "growth without employment", and has registered a&#13;

&amp;#12;   dramatic worsening of all basic indicators of the labor market. Since the beginning of the global&#13;
   economic crisis, the employment rate of the working age population has decreased by ten&#13;
   percentage points, from 54.0% in April 2008 to 44.2% in April in 2012 , reflecting the cumulative&#13;
   decline in employment for more than half a million employees. As indicated womenâ&#128;&#153;s employment&#13;
   activity is slightly lower in general population. Tables below offer overview of employment and&#13;
   unemployment trends with gender segregated data.&#13;

   When looking at the distributional impact of core near-term fiscal consolidation measures it is&#13;
   important to consider the fact that public sector workers are on average paid more than private&#13;
   sector workers.3 As shown in the Table 4, public sector employment is more prevalent in the top&#13;
   income deciles.&#13;

The National Employment Strategy 2011â&#128;&#147;2020 provides a long-term framework for employment&#13;
policy development, which is operationalised by passing and implementing the National&#13;
Employment Action Plan on an annual basis. In compliance with the Law on Employment and&#13;
Unemployment Insurance and the national employment action plans, municipal authorities adopt&#13;
local employment action plans, setting the local employment policy priorities and objectives,&#13;
defining and implementing local employment measures.&#13;
The National Employment Action Plan sets annual policy priorities and objectives and the&#13;
implementation of active labor market measures. The active labor market measures are the key&#13;
instrument for improving the functioning of the labor market with targeted support to unemployed&#13;
persons. The active labor market measures stipulated in the Law on Employment and&#13;
Unemployment Insurance include job-matching services, vocational guidance and career&#13;
counselling, job creation and self-employment subsidies, additional education and training,&#13;
incentives for unemployment benefit recipients, public works and other employment promotion&#13;
measures.&#13;
The 2015 National Employment Action Plan envisages the implementation of the following active&#13;
employment policy measures: job-matching services for jobseekers; vocational guidance and&#13;
career counselling; subsidies for employment of unemployed persons from the category of&#13;
disadvantaged persons (youth up to age 30, persons above 50 years of age, redundant workers,&#13;
Roma, persons with disabilities); support to self-employment; additional education and training;&#13;
incentives for hiring unemployment benefit recipients; public works; active labor market measures&#13;
for persons with disabilities; co-financing of active labor market programmes or measures&#13;
envisaged by local employment action plans with funds from the national budget (at the request of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           19&#13;
&amp;#12;provincial or local governments); integration of financial social assistance recipients in the labor&#13;
market.&#13;
According to the National Employment Service (NES) data, active labor market measures&#13;
implemented by the NES in 2013 covered 99,946 unemployed persons or 12.9% Ð¾f the average&#13;
number of unemployed persons registered by NES4. The funds earmarked for these measures in&#13;
2013 totalled RSD 1,180,000,000 or about 0.03% of the GDP. Employment contracts were signed&#13;
by 21,932 beneficiaries of the measures, which accounted for 21.94% of the total number of&#13;
persons covered by active labor market measures. Moreover, the number of hard-to-employ&#13;
persons included in active labor market measures was 91,038 or 91.09% of the total number of&#13;
persons included in active labor market measures (99,946 persons). In 2013, the measures and&#13;
activities aimed at stimulating employment and vocational rehabilitation of persons with&#13;
disabilities, undertaken by the National Employment Service, were financed from the Budget Fund&#13;
for Vocational Rehabilitation and Promotion of Employment of Persons with Disabilities, in the&#13;
total amount of RSD 405,289,255.25. These funds were spent on three measures, namely:&#13;
vocational rehabilitation measures and activities - RSD 27,273,913.55 (6.7%), promotion of&#13;
employment of persons with disabilities - RSD 360,664,226.31 (89.0%) and reimbursement of the&#13;
costs of workplace adaptation for persons with disabilities employed under special conditions and&#13;
reimbursement of the costs of professional support to persons with disabilities employed under&#13;
special conditions - RSD 17,351,115.39 (4.3%)5. The funds earmarked for active labor market&#13;
measures in the 2014 Budget Law of the Republic of Serbia were significantly lower than in the&#13;
previous year and totalled RSD 600,000,000, with the additional RSD 519,000,000 earmarked for&#13;
the Budget Fund for Vocational Rehabilitation and Promotion of Employment of Persons with&#13;
Disabilities. However, the total coverage of persons by active labor market measures remained the&#13;
same because the focus was put on intensification of non-financial measures. The financial&#13;
measures (vocational internship, trainings for labor market, trainings at employersâ&#128;&#153; request, self-&#13;
employment subsidies, functional primary adult education, subsidies to employers for new job&#13;
creation, public works, subsidies to wages of PWD without work experience and PWD support&#13;
incentives) were very limited: 5,924 persons were included in these measures in 2014 as compared&#13;
to 12,517 in 2013.&#13;
The results of active labor market measures evaluation studies conducted in the Republic of Serbia&#13;
in recent years may be summarised as follows: the measures aimed at active job-seeking do not&#13;
produce significant net effects, their intensity is modest, they are cost-effective and more useful&#13;
for persons with lower education levels. Training programmes have long-term positive effects,&#13;
while the largest net effects are delivered by training programmes at an identified employerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
request. The strongest direct impact is produced by programmes providing direct employment&#13;
subsidies, but they are generally expensive and the conclusion is that recruitment would have&#13;
occurred even without the financial support. Nevertheless, these measures are significant,&#13;
especially in the situations of suppressed labor demand. Self-employment programmes are useful&#13;
as a means of supporting and intensifying the recovery of the labor supply. The programmes of&#13;
public works render more significant effects when they are implemented as a means of labor and&#13;
social activation than as a measure for promoting employability and employment with&#13;
exceptionally strong psychological effect on the beneficiaries.&#13;

&amp;#12;3. Program Social Management System (SMS)&#13;
The Program will rely on the Social Management System (SMS) to ensure that any potential&#13;
adverse social impacts are adequately identified, avoided or mitigated. Generally, the social&#13;
management system (SMS) aims at preventing and mitigating potential negative impacts of the&#13;
Program activities on the population, in particularly with regards to:&#13;
   ï&#130;· Potential retrenchment of public sector employees&#13;
   ï&#130;· Potential unequitable gender distribution of retrenchment impacts&#13;
   ï&#130;· Grievance redress, through mechanisms for receiving, managing and resolving disputes&#13;
       that may arise as a consequence of retrenchment&#13;
&#13;
The Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) includes:&#13;
- regulatory and legislative framework;&#13;
- institutional arrangements and institutional capacity to identify environmental and social risks&#13;
and to implement, monitor and follow up on the evaluation of mitigation measures.&#13;
- grievance mechanisms including the procedures and tools for affected people to resolve disputes&#13;
- monitoring and evaluation processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is the responsibility of the Borrower to implement the Environmental and Social Management&#13;
System and ensure the compliance with proposed mitigation actions.&#13;

3.1. Legal Framework&#13;
The right to work is a fundamental right defined and guaranteed by the Constitution (Official&#13;
Gazette RS, No. 98/2006), which in Article 60 states: Right to work shall be guaranteed in accordance&#13;
with the law. Everyone shall have the right to choose his occupation freely. All work places shall be&#13;
available to everyone under equal conditions. Everyone shall have the right to respect of his person at&#13;
work, safe and healthy working conditions, necessary protection at work, limited working hours,&#13;
daily and weekly interval for rest, paid annual holiday, fair remuneration for work done and legal&#13;
protection in case of termination of working relations. No person may forgo these rights. Women,&#13;
young and disabled persons shall be provided with special protection at work and special work&#13;
conditions in accordance with the law.&#13;
In addition, the Constitution provides for prohibition of discrimination (Article 21) including&#13;
discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, nationality, social origin, birth, religion, political&#13;
orientation, social status, culture, language, age and disability. Article 26 prohibits slavery and&#13;
forced labor. Article 69 provides the right for social protection including unemployment benefits.&#13;
Article 36 provides for the right for equal protection of rights including right to appeal.&#13;
The Republic of Serbia ratified a number of ILO conventions including the fundamental&#13;
conventions (Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948&#13;
(No. 87), Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), Forced Labor&#13;
Convention, 1930 (No. 29) Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, 1957 (No. 105) Minimum Age&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;Convention, 1973 (No. 138) Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention, 1999 (No. 182) Equal&#13;
Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100) , Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention,&#13;
1981 (No. 156) Tripartite Consultation (International Labor Standards) Convention, 1976 (No.&#13;
144) and the Termination of Employment Convention No. 158.&#13;
The area of labor market and employment is regulated by a corpus of labor acts and bylaws which&#13;
have been thoroughly reconstructed in the past ten years. The Labor Law (2005) with its latest&#13;
changes in August 2014, is a basic law regulating rights and obligations of employees and&#13;
employers, the working hours, health and safety, salaries, determining the redundancy of&#13;
employees, termination of employment, severance payments, work outside of employment&#13;
contract, organization of employees (unions) and employers, and collective bargaining.&#13;
The legal framework regulating the retrenchment due to technological, economic or organizational&#13;
changes, and related mitigation measures includes the following set of laws:&#13;
Labor Law (Official Gazette RS, No. 24/05, 61/05, 54/09, 32/13 Ð¸ 75/14) is overarching law&#13;
applying to all employees on the territory of the Republic of Serbia, unless otherwise specified in&#13;
certain provisions. Provisions of this law shall apply to employees of public bodies, territorial&#13;
autonomy bodies and local self-government and public services, unless the law stipulates&#13;
otherwise. The law provides for rights of employees and obligations of the employers in cases of&#13;
employment termination and retrenchment (Articles 153 â&#128;&#147; 160). The law also provides for the&#13;
dispute resolution mechanism which is based on the role of Arbiter (Articles 194 â&#128;&#147; 195). The law&#13;
provides a right to the employee to initiate a dispute before the court.&#13;
The Labor Law significantly covers occupational safety and health issues. According to Labor&#13;
Law, the employee is granted safety and protection of life and health at work, health protection,&#13;
the protection of personal integrity and other rights in case of illness, reduction or loss of working&#13;
capability and age (Articles 80 â&#128;&#147; 83). According to the law (Articles 84 â&#128;&#147; 88) persons under the&#13;
age of 18 are not allowed to perform the duties including: hard physical work; working under&#13;
ground, under water or at considerable heights; exposure to harmful radiation or poisonous,&#13;
carcinogen materials or those which cause genetic health conditions; health-related risk due to&#13;
excessive warm or cold temperatures, noise or vibrations; work longer than 35 hours a week, i.e.&#13;
7 hours a day; and work at night.&#13;

Some of these collective agreements have provisions with respect to retrenchment, which will be&#13;
referenced in further analysis.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis in the matrix below indicates how these laws apply to specific areas and issues related&#13;
to termination of labor relations as consequence of major changes in program, organization,&#13;
structure or technology of an employer (retrenchment).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   26&#13;
&amp;#12;                            Rationale and Scope for Retrenchment&#13;
&#13;
The Labor Law (Art 153) provides for termination of an employment contract on the grounds&#13;
that "due to technological, economic or organizational changes a particular job becomes&#13;
redundant or volume of work be reduced".&#13;
The Labor Law requires that employer prepares a Retrenchment Program, when employees are&#13;
made redundant over a period of 30 days in the following instances (definition of collective&#13;
dismissal):&#13;
1) 10 employees out of a total of 20 to 99 staff employed for an indefinite term;&#13;
2) 10% of employees, out of a total of 100 to 299 staff employed for an indefinite term;&#13;
3) 30 employees out of at least 300 staff employed for an indefinite term;&#13;
4) 20 employees notwithstanding of the number of employees, over a period of 90 days.&#13;
The law prescribes that the Retrenchment Program should include the following components:&#13;
     1) rationale for determining the redundancy of employees;&#13;
     2) total number of employees with the respective employer;&#13;
     3) number of redundant employees, their qualifications and job positions, age, and length&#13;
of employment (years) covered by the employment insurance benefits;&#13;
     4) selection criteria for determining redundant employees;&#13;
    5) measures for alternative employment: transfer to other jobs; transfer to other&#13;
employer; training; part-time work, but not less than 50% of the full time and other measures;&#13;
     6) resources to address the socio-economic status of the redundant employees;&#13;
      7) employment termination deadline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Civil Servants&#13;
The Law on Civil Servants and the Collective agreement for employees in state administration&#13;
will regulate the redundancy of the civil servants. Articles 133 â&#128;&#147; 137 of the Law regulate&#13;
termination of employment as a result of major changes in the organization or in instances when&#13;
an organizational entity is merged or dissolved.&#13;
The Law on Civil Servants provides that in instances when certain job positions would have&#13;
been abolished, the redundant civil servants can be reassigned to other job positions. The civil&#13;
servants with higher job evaluation in the past three years, would be given the advantage in the&#13;
reassignment process.&#13;
Articles 138 â&#128;&#147; 139 regulate the rights of unassigned civil servants. The unassigned civil servants&#13;
are registered by the Human Resources Services and being considered for the positions in the&#13;
internal job market. During the period of being unassigned, the civil servant is entitled to receive&#13;
a salary.&#13;
If within the two months period the unassigned civil servant is not assigned to other state organ,&#13;
the employment with the stathe administration will be terminated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  27&#13;
&amp;#12;                                  Consultations with workers&#13;
&#13;
Prior consultations with trade unions is required by the Labor Law. The employer is required to&#13;
send the proposed retrenchment program to the respective union or workersâ&#128;&#153; organization and&#13;
the National Employment Service, within 8 days of the program preparation, in order to obtain&#13;
their opinion (Articles 154 and 156).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Employer's obligation to consider alternatives to termination of labor relations&#13;

criteria for right-sizing be based on the following analysis: a) legal and strategic framework of&#13;
the respective state body/public service; b) financial and personnel resources; c) ensuring that&#13;

                                                                                               30&#13;
&amp;#12; The civil servant can initiate the administrative dispute against the decision of the Appeals&#13;
 Commission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Compensation for unfair dismissal&#13;
&#13;
 The Labor Law (Article 191) provides for compensation in instances when the court determined&#13;
 that an employee was dismissed against the legal grounds. Damages in lieu of reinstatement:&#13;
 - maximum 18 months' salary when the employee does not wish to be reinstated or&#13;
 - maximum 36 months upon request or the employer or when case the existing circumstances&#13;
 suggest that the continuation of labor relations is not possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The legal framework related to retrenchment is in principle in line with international standards&#13;
and ILO conventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2. Institutional Arrangement&#13;
Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self Government (MPALSG) is the&#13;
implementing agency of the Program. As such, it is responsible for ensuring the adequate&#13;
implementation of the SMS.&#13;
&#13;
The MPALSG coordinates the entire process of implementation of the PAR Strategy as well as&#13;
the pertaining comprehensive process of public administration optimization and rightsizing.&#13;
MPALSG prepared the action plan and general guidance for other ministries for the rightsizing&#13;
process. Once the updated and expanded Registry of Employees in the Public Sector is established,&#13;
the MPALSG will be in charge for the Registry.&#13;
&#13;
According to the Law on the Maximum Number of Employees in the Public sector, the MPALSG&#13;
and the Ministry of Finance have the responsibility over the budget for the severance payments in&#13;
the public sector. The exception are severance payment for employees in the health services. The&#13;
State Statutory Fond for Health Insurance holds the budget for severance payments in the health&#13;
sector. The Law on the Maximum Number of Employees gives the MPALSG and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance the authority to issue on opinion on the proposal for the maximum number of employees&#13;
for every calendar year until 2018, submitted by other state entities.&#13;
&#13;
To increase its capacities to manage the rightsizing, which will take place from 2015 to 2018, the&#13;
MPALSG is in the process of establishing the Change Management Team. This Team will&#13;
coordinate communication and policy briefings on the projects including the public sector reform&#13;
and rightsizing. Additionally, the Change Management Team will be expected to incrementally&#13;
channel the findings of the Functional Review at every stage into actionable policy&#13;
recommendations for senior management action. The team will be staffed by a mixture of existing&#13;
civil servants and professional consultants with expertise in various disciplines. It will report to&#13;
the State Secretary in the MPALSG.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   31&#13;
&amp;#12;To reach out the diverse stakeholders, the Ministry prepared the communication strategy and&#13;
action plan related to the rightsizing and optimization of the public administration. The strategy&#13;
was based on the public opinion surveys conducted in early 2015. The MPALSG communications&#13;
team is working closely with communications advisers of other ministries to inform citizens, and&#13;
employees of the public sector about the reform, rightsizing, itâ&#128;&#153;s benefits and risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Finance has the responsibility for the state budget; determining of consolidated&#13;
balance of public revenue and public spending; system and policy of taxes, tariffs and other public&#13;
revenue; public expenditure policy; management of available public funds of the Republic of&#13;
Serbia; public debt and financial assets of the Republic of Serbia. According to the Law on the&#13;
Maximum Number of Employees, Ministry of Finance issues their opinion on the proposal for the&#13;
maximum number of employees for every calendar year until 2018, submitted by other state&#13;
entities, and monitors the implementation of the law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs is in charge of creating the&#13;
employment policy in Serbia. Within this Ministry there is a Sector for creation of employment&#13;
dealing with employment affairs. The responsibilities of this sector include: Employment in&#13;
country and abroad; Monitoring the situation and trends on the labor market in the country and&#13;
abroad; Improvement and boosting of employment; Strategy, program and measures of active and&#13;
passive employment policy; Employment of disabled persons and other persons; Exercise of the&#13;
right to unemployment benefits; Preparation of the national standard of qualifications and proposal&#13;
of measures for improvement of the system of adult education.&#13;
Long-term framework for creation of employment policy is specified in the National&#13;
Employment Strategy for 2011-2020 (The Official Gazette of the RS, No. 37/2011), whereas&#13;
national action plans for employment are adopted on annual level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The National Employment Service is responsible for implementation of the employment policy&#13;
and action plan. The NES performs a key function of the Serbian labor market by being the&#13;
matchmaker between employers and job seekers. In addition, the NES has the additional&#13;
responsibility of supporting those job seekers that face difficulties in the labor market by providing&#13;
programs to enhance job seekers prospects, like training; wage subsidy programs, especially for&#13;
disabled or otherwise disadvantaged jobs seekers; start-up support for prospective self-employed;&#13;
or public works for those who have not had work for a long time. In that sense, the NES is not only&#13;
a match-maker that ensures a well-functioning labor market, but also a provider of social services&#13;
for vulnerable groups. After the termination of employment, the retrenched workers register with&#13;
NES in order to access the unemployment benefits and participate in program for active&#13;
employment and trainings.&#13;
The National Action Plan for 2015 foresees the implementation of the following measures of active&#13;
employment policy: employment mediation for persons seeking employment; professional&#13;
guidance and counselling on carrier planning; incentives for employment of the low employability&#13;
group (younger than 30 years of age, older than 50, redundant workers, Roma people, disabled&#13;
persons); support to self-employment; additional education and training; incentives for&#13;
employment of the beneficiaries of the benefits; public works; active employment measures for&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   32&#13;
&amp;#12;disabled persons; co-financing the program or measures of active employment policy envisaged&#13;
in the local action plans from the budget funds of the&#13;
&#13;
The Law on Employment and Unemployment Benefits prescribes the obligation to sign annual&#13;
agreement on performance between the competent Ministry and the National Employment&#13;
Agency, in view of defining the performance goals for the NEA and monitoring the efficiency of&#13;
the implementation of the active employment policy measures. The NEA is expected to achieve&#13;
the results defined in the agreement by means of adapting the measures and activities to&#13;
specificities and conditions of the local labor markets. Moreover, expected results of the branch&#13;
offices should be quantified and agreements on performance of the branch offices should be signed&#13;
on the level of entire NEA.&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with the Law on Employment and Unemployment Benefits, the NEA is responsible&#13;
for the following tasks related to employment: informing on the conditions and opportunities for&#13;
employment; mediation of employment in the country and abroad; professional guidance and&#13;
career planning counselling; conducting active employment policy measures; issuing working&#13;
permit to a foreigner or person without a citizenship; unemployment insurance; exercise of rights&#13;
deriving from the unemployment insurance in accordance with the law; keeping records in the area&#13;
of employment as well as professional-organizational, administrative, economic-financial and&#13;
other common affairs in the area of employment and unemployment insurance.&#13;
&#13;
The NEA must provide the following services to the job seeker or employer: a) information on&#13;
laws, bylaws, collective agreements and other general documents, rights and obligations of the&#13;
employers and employees and of their associations, in relation to employment and unemployment&#13;
insurance; b) guidance about the manner and procedure of exercising the rights and obligations as&#13;
well as the assistance in completion of the forms and in submission of those forms and documents&#13;
to the NEA.&#13;
&#13;
The Government Human Resource Management Service performs tasks related to HR&#13;
management in ministries, special organizations of the government, services of the Government&#13;
and support services of administrative districts. The Service performs functions of on internal job&#13;
market for the civil servants. The tasks of the Service include: advertising internal job vacancies,&#13;
preparing a proposal of the HR Plan for the Government and ensure proper implementation of the&#13;
adopted HR Plan; provision of opinion on internal organization and staffing rulebooks in public&#13;
administration bodies; assistance to public administration bodies concerning HR management and&#13;
internal organization; administration of the Central HR Registry on civil servants and employees&#13;
in public administration bodies; keeping records of the internal labor market in public&#13;
administration bodies, helping civil servants with their transfer and re-assignment, preparation and&#13;
implementation of training programs for civil servants, and technical support for the High Civil&#13;
Service Council and the Government Appeals Board.&#13;
During the implementation of the Law on the Maximum Number of Employees in the public&#13;
Sector, the un-assigned civil servants will be transferred to the internal job market which is&#13;
coordinated by the Human Resource Management Service (as per Law on Civil Servants, Art 138&#13;
and 163).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 33&#13;
&amp;#12;The OSH Directorate under the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs&#13;
among other duties is responsible for monitoring of the performance of people in charge of OSH&#13;
issues in organizations. The OSH Directorate is in charge of issuing and revoking OSH licenses.&#13;
Its task also includes organization of the license exams. The OSH Directorate also provides expert&#13;
assistance to employees in OSH field.&#13;
&#13;
Labor Inspection Service within the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs&#13;
conducts supervision of employment relations and occupational safety and health. OSH labor&#13;
inspector carries out supervision over the implementation of OSH Law, technical and other&#13;
measures related to occupational safety and health, as well as over implementation of OSH&#13;
measures prescribed by employerâ&#128;&#153;s General Act, collective agreement or employment contract.&#13;
&#13;
4. Assessment of Institutional Capacity and Performance&#13;
4.1. Adequacy of Social Management Systems associated to retrenchment&#13;
Serbia has in place relatively well developed policy and legal framework on labor relations and&#13;
retrenchment along with an institutional system which is generally adequate. The national legal&#13;
framework is generally in line with international standards. Serbia ratified the ILO Termination of&#13;
Employment Convention No. 158. In general, the legal framework is consistent with principles of&#13;
the IFC Performance Standards 2 â&#128;&#147; Labor and Working Conditions, (paragraphs 18. â&#128;&#147; 19. on&#13;
retrenchment). The identified gaps are related to the implementation of consultation with workers,&#13;
and to monitoring and evaluation of the retrenchment process.&#13;
The existing labor legislation provides adequate protection of workers in instances when due to&#13;
technological, economic or organizational changes a particular job becomes redundant or volume&#13;
of work would be reduced.&#13;
Labor legal acts provide for considering alternatives to termination of employment including&#13;
hiring freeze, enforcement of retirement ages, outsourcing of particular activities (example, in&#13;
health), internal transfers and redeployment, and reduction in salaries. Some of these measures&#13;
such as natural attrition through retirement, hiring freeze, and reduction in salaries have already&#13;
been implemented in the public sector in 2014 and 2015 as a part of the package of measures to&#13;
reduce government spending and increase fiscal sustainability.&#13;
The labor law requires that the employer prepare a retrenchment plan. The respective union and&#13;
National Employment Service are to provide their opinion on the proposed plan. Legal acts and&#13;
specific collective agreements that apply to employees in the public sector, stipulate for selection&#13;
criteria and principles when termination of employment occurs as a consequence of changes in&#13;
program, organization or structure of work. The selection criteria are grounded on the non-&#13;
discrimination principles, which are in line with good international practice. These provisions&#13;
specifically protect employees from being retrenched due to a membership in a union, pregnancy,&#13;
maternity leave, disability leave, child care leave, personal disability, national and social origin,&#13;
and other personal characteristics. The collective agreements provide protection for mothers of&#13;
children of age less than 2 years and single headed households with under-aged children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  34&#13;
&amp;#12;Laws and collective agreements provide provisions for redundancy payments and formulas for its&#13;
calculation. The redundancy payment is calculated on the basis of 30% of average monthly salary&#13;
prior to retrenchment, for every year of service with the employer. Employees are also entitled to&#13;
unemployment benefits, health care and pension insurance. While these legal provisions are in&#13;
accordance with good practice, the experience of large retrenchments in the past, due to&#13;
privatization of large state owned enterprises indicate that there is a reason for caution. These&#13;
benefits are provided for a limited period of time. In an environment with high unemployment rate&#13;
and lack of job supply, it would be unrealistic to assume that majority of retrenched people would&#13;
find new employment easily (World Bank, PSIA, 2009).&#13;
The Labor Law and applicable collective agreements require consultations with unions related to&#13;
the retrenchment program. However, it seems that in practice there are cases when such&#13;
consultations occur to a lesser degree, i.e. consultations with workers are not systematically&#13;
observed. The Law on the Maximum Number of Employees, which serves as an instrument for&#13;
the rightsizing in the public sector, was adopted under an urgent parliamentary procedure and&#13;
therefore, it was not a subject to public consultations. The unions and the Socio-Economic Council&#13;
issued public statements to express their dissatisfaction with lack of consultation and their inputs.&#13;
It should be noted that relevant laws do not include specific requirements for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of retrenchment programs and status of retrenched employees. There are no&#13;
requirements for the employers to follow the situation of the retrenched workers or outcomes of&#13;
assistance provided. Once the labor relations are terminated, the National Employment Service&#13;
(NES) tracks and follows the status of retrenched workers, who decide to register with NES.&#13;
In general, the legal framework for the protection of the retrenched workers is broadly in place,&#13;
but its consistent implementation across the country needs to be ensured, notably in the areas of&#13;
consultations with workers (unions), transparent retrenchment criteria and follow up monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the status of affected workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2. Adequacy of Social Management Capacity&#13;
Several ministries and state agencies such as Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and National&#13;
Employment service (NES) have acquired solid experience and the skills needed to manage large&#13;
retrenchment during the privatization of state owned enterprises, which occurred in the past 15&#13;
years. The National Employment Service, as an implementer of the employment policy has&#13;
specific programs targeting retrenched workers, women, and vulnerable groups.&#13;
Representatives of NES indicated that they are in the process of the preparation for the Action Plan&#13;
for 2016. This plan is supposed to include programs for retrenched public sector workers tailored&#13;
to their specific profile: higher education level, age (there is high probability that significant&#13;
portion will be over the age of 50), and gender (there is high probability that women will represent&#13;
higher percentage of affected employees). Having in mind that a large proportion of this segment&#13;
of the labor force spent most of their career working in the public sector, which provides higher&#13;
job security comparing to other sectors, it can be assumed that measures such as setting up small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  35&#13;
&amp;#12;enterprises would be effective to a lesser degree. The employment assistance programs for this&#13;
segment of the workforce are under development.&#13;
Other assessments indicated that there is a need to modernize the NES and bring it in line with&#13;
European requirements, increasing its service orientation and its ability to provide services tailored&#13;
to its client needs. This PforR operation will benefit from other World Bank funded project â&#128;&#156;Jobs&#13;
and Competivenessâ&#128;&#157;, which includes the labor component and will support modernization of NES&#13;
including following activities:&#13;
           a. Enhancing the effectiveness of the National Employment Service (NES) labor&#13;
              intermediation services for employers and the unemployed;&#13;
           b. Improving the effectiveness of the active labor market programs (ALMPs);&#13;
           c. Facilitating the transition of social assistance beneficiaries into formal jobs;&#13;
&#13;
At the core of activities supported by this project is the improvement of the capacity and the&#13;
services provided by NES. It is expected that potentially retrenched workers from the public&#13;
sector will benefit from enhanced services provided by NES.&#13;
Ministries in charge for specific sectors such as health or education had periodic meetings with&#13;
unions to inform them about the rightsizing process. This information is publically available on&#13;
the websites of ministries and unions.&#13;
The social management capacity is generally adequate. The identified areas for capacity&#13;
enhancement will be addressed through the proposed action plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Environmental and Social Systems Assessment Action Plan&#13;
5.1. Social Systems Assessment Action Plan related to retrenchment&#13;
Although the overall positive economic impacts of the Program are expected to be positive, there&#13;
could also be some adverse social impacts associated to retrenchment of workers in public entities&#13;
which represents a reputational and technical risk for the Program, the Government and the World&#13;
Bank. The Program provides an opportunity to strengthen the procedures to identify and mitigate&#13;
any adverse effects associated to retrenchment in accordance with internationally recognized&#13;
practices.&#13;
On the technical side, to fill the gaps between the existing social management system and&#13;
international good practice identified through this social systems assessment, the program will&#13;
support specific measures to enhance performance of the social management system related to&#13;
retrenchment. These measures will be implemented on the basis of the following actions:&#13;
1) Prepare clear guidelines to implement the Article 7. of the Law on the Maximum number of&#13;
Employees in the Public Sector. MPALSG as the coordinator of the PAR reform and the rightsizing&#13;
process, will prepare guidelines for the other ministries on how to carry out the strategic and&#13;
functional analysis in a way that minimizes adverse social impacts and based on the principles of&#13;
fairness and transparency. The guidelines will be prepared by November 30, 2015.&#13;
2) Ensure that the Change Management Unit within MPALSG has staff assigned to coordinate,&#13;
monitor and report on the rightsizing process and its effects. By the start of the Program, the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   36&#13;
&amp;#12;MPALSG to assign two staff members with relevant competences and experience (knowledge of&#13;
human resources and labor relations procedures) to coordinate the rightsizing process with other&#13;
public sector entities, and to provide regular periodic reports on the status of actions from this&#13;
Program Action Plan.&#13;
3) Improve consultations with workers and workers organizations (unions): At the level of each&#13;
employer in the public sector, prepare the consultation plan and document that the unions or worker&#13;
representatives were consulted in relation to retrenchment and respective retrenchment plans. Each&#13;
public entity submitting the request for redundancy payment to the MPALSG to attach minutes&#13;
from the consultations or written comments by the unions (workersâ&#128;&#153; representatives) on the&#13;
retrenchment plan. If requested, a sample of these reports would be submitted to the World Bank&#13;
for review.&#13;
4) Selection Criteria: The criteria for selection of employees who will be made redundant will be:&#13;
transparent, non-discriminatory, applied consistently and contain appeal procedure. The criteria&#13;
will be consistent with provisions in the applicable national labor legislation and collective&#13;
agreements, and reinforce protections of following categories of workers: pregnant women,&#13;
women on maternity leave, single parents, women headed households, mothers of children under&#13;
the age of two, employees on disability leave, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and&#13;
households where both providers are employed in the public sector. Every employer who will&#13;
reduce its workforce will make the criteria for retrenchment publically available on its bulletin&#13;
board. The retrenchment criteria and the rationale will be included in the retrenchment plans.&#13;
5) Retrenchment plans: As required by the Labor Law, the employers in the public sector will&#13;
prepare retrenchment plans to document that requirements from the Labor Law, Civil Servants&#13;
Law and applicable collective agreements were respected. The Retrenchment Plan will include the&#13;
following elements:&#13;
     i.) rationale for determining the redundancy of employees;&#13;
     ii.) total number of employees with the respective employer;&#13;
     iii.) number of redundant employees, their qualifications and job positions, age, and length&#13;
     of employment (years) covered by the employment insurance benefits; gender segregated&#13;
     information (number of males and females), number of persons with disabilities.&#13;
     iv.) selection criteria for determining redundant employees;&#13;
     v.) measures for alternative employment such as: transfer to other jobs; transfer to other&#13;
     employer; training; part-time work, but not less than 50% of the full time and other measures;&#13;
     vi.) resources to address the socio-economic status of the redundant employees;&#13;
     vii.) employment termination deadline.&#13;
The proposed draft retrenchment plan will be submitted to the relevant workersâ&#128;&#153; representatives&#13;
or union, and the National Employment Service for consultation. The period of advance notice and&#13;
the length of consultation must follow the provisions from the Labor Law. The consultations will&#13;
be documented in writing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                37&#13;
&amp;#12;6) Transition assistance to retrenched employees: The MPALSG will agree with the Ministry of&#13;
Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs to include in the 2016 performance agreement with the&#13;
National Employment Service (NES) a requirement that (i) NES representative visits every entity&#13;
that will retrench more than 10 workers and inform workers about available NES services,&#13;
programs, and benefits, register them with NES, and develop an individual action plan for each&#13;
registered redundant worker; (ii) to contact at least 20 employers in the same and neighboring&#13;
municipalities where the public entity resides to offer them NES services and inquire about job&#13;
vacancies; and (iii) to consult with the local employment council about support for redundant&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
7) Gender and social inclusion â&#128;&#147; The MPALSG and the Statutory Health Insurance Fund will&#13;
request that submitted retrenchment plans and requests for redundancy (severance) payment&#13;
include segregated information according to gender (number of males/females), persons with&#13;
disabilities (number), ethnic minority (number).&#13;
8) Monitoring of redundancy (severance) payment disbursement and status of retrenched workers&#13;
â&#128;&#147; The MPALSG will monitor and report annually on the number of workers who received the&#13;
severance (redundancy) payment, as prescribed in the Law on the Maximum Number of&#13;
Employees in the Public Sector. NES will monitor and report annually on the status of retrenched&#13;
workers in terms of: a) number of retrenched workers (number of male/female) who received&#13;
active employment services from NES; and b) number of retrenched workers (number of&#13;
male/female) who found new employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2. Environmental Systems Assessment Action Plan&#13;
The Program is not expected to cause major environmental concerns. Potential impacts are related&#13;
to occupational health and safety issues during potential minor office refurbishment operations.&#13;
Serbia has a relatively strong regulatory and institutional framework to manage occupational&#13;
health and safety. In order to strengthen mitigation of potential health and safety risks the following&#13;
is recommended:&#13;
1) Appoint a licensed person in charge of occupational health and safety issues, as stipulated in&#13;
the Occupational Health and Safety Law, as a pre-requisite to refurbishment activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    38&#13;
&amp;#12;   6. Assessment of environmental and social risk level&#13;
The assessment of environmental and social risk level associated with the program is considered&#13;
substantial. The assessment is based on the identified social risk associated with the potential&#13;
retrenchment of public sector employees. Proposed measures to mitigate social impacts of the&#13;
program, and to improve environmental and social management systems, in compliance with the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Operational Policy OP 9.00 for PforR operations, have been incorporated into the&#13;
ESSA Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
