        Strengthening the&#13;
        Public Oversight System&#13;
&#13;
    The consolidation of democracies in developing           effort designed to strengthen the public control&#13;
    countries requires appropriate accountability            systems that characterize democratic regimes.&#13;
    with regard to public resources. Corruption and&#13;
    inefficiency in the use of resources appear as a&#13;
    growing citizen concern. In the context of gov-          2.1	 SAI Models&#13;
    ernance reforms that seek to strengthen trans-&#13;
    parency and accountability processes, there is a         In this context, Supreme Audit Institutions&#13;
    need to have external oversight agencies more            (SAIs) represent a key component in what are&#13;
    involved in producing concrete results that are          generally complex public oversight systems. De-&#13;
    observable by citizens. In that sense, these agen-       pending on the institutional placement of the&#13;
    cies should take on new roles, because they have         oversight agencies, it is possible to distinguish&#13;
    been considered to be eminently technical and            between two types of public control: external&#13;
    beyond the reach of society.                             and internal. External oversight entities are not&#13;
          This need is being recognized even by the          part of the organization to be audited, while in-&#13;
    oversight agencies themselvesâ&#128;&#148;which, as com-             ternal control entities are those established with-&#13;
    plex state agencies, usually display a more cau-         in the various organizations that are the subject&#13;
    tious approach to these types of transparen-             of control. Therefore, external control agencies&#13;

    of 2007, the International Organization of Su-           greater margin for collaboration with civil so-&#13;

    this case, the SAI presents the findings regarding     of control functions. This description is only in-&#13;

&#13;
       a) 	 The union of audit institutionsâ&#128;&#153; personnel (APOC) created a website that is used to disseminate sum-&#13;
            marized versions of the reports generated by the various audits, which use plain language. The texts&#13;
            that serve as a basis for the summaries are the official AGN reports. That is, they are not â&#128;&#156;preliminary&#13;
            versions,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;drafts,â&#128;&#157; or any of the intermediate documents that are generated in an auditing process.&#13;
&#13;
      	    Through this service, the population may access the site or request to daily receive news related&#13;
           to the reports developed by the national or provincial oversight agencies. The portal also contains&#13;
           academic papers on external auditing systems and assessments of their functioning.&#13;
&#13;
      	    It is noteworthy that the union has undertaken this type of work; but it is also useful to understand&#13;
           that such an entity is another actor that has a concrete interest in strengthening the audit agencies.&#13;
           Typically those working within audit institutions are career professionals who have no ties to a specific&#13;
           administration, which makes clear the affinity they may have with initiatives seeking to enhance the&#13;
           independence and the impact of the SAIs work.&#13;
&#13;
      b) 	 Through its press department, the AGN sends journalists, Ombudsmen, CSOs and subscribers a&#13;
           bulletin explaining briefly and in a non technical language, the findings of the most important reports&#13;
           produced by the agency. This information contains a description of the objective of the corresponding&#13;
           audit, the period audited, the context in which it was carried out and the conclusions drawn from it. An&#13;
           example of such reports may be seen in www.agn.gov.ar/informes/informesPDF2008/Ficha_021_08.&#13;
           pdf. AsociaciÃ³n Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ) promoted the dissemination of this bulletin&#13;
           and assisted the AGN in developing a wide database of contacts to disseminate the information.&#13;

      Box 2.â&#128;&#130; South Korea: Civil Society Advocacy Actions for a Full Dissemination of Audit Reports&#13;
&#13;
      Until not too long ago, the Board of Audit and Inspection (South KoreaÂ´s SAI) only publicly disclosed audit&#13;
      summaries . It held that audit reports were internal materials for the State, intended for corrective use.&#13;
      A group of politicians, CSOs and journalists formed a coalition to demand changing this practice. They&#13;
      asserted that the principle that should govern disclosure consisted of the fact that the state belongs to&#13;
      citizens in general, and therefore each individual constituting it has a legitimate interest in gaining access&#13;
      to the reports in which the performance of government offices is assessed. The coalitionâ&#128;&#153;s pressure led&#13;
      to a change in policy, and currently the complete texts are published, with the exception of the material&#13;
      including â&#128;&#156;state secretsâ&#128;&#157; or such matters that â&#128;&#156;if disclosed, could affect national security.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

  Federal de Acceso a la InformaciÃ³n PÃºblica, IFAI) to promote transparency in oversight functions&#13;
&#13;
  Both agencies report to different branches of government. While IFAI is a decentralized agency of the&#13;
  Federal Public Administration, ASF is an auxiliary agency of the Chamber of Deputies which enjoys&#13;
  technical autonomy. However, on April 2, 2006, they both signed an agreement intended to define joint&#13;
  activities in the field of transparency, access to public government information and superior oversight.&#13;
  The ultimate goal is to promote a culture of accountability. The press release issued by the two agencies&#13;
  recognizes that they both have a growing presence and influence in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s public life and that,&#13;
  therefore, an agreement between them to improve access to public information related to the functions&#13;
  entrusted to the ASF represents a major step forward in external control activities. The agreement is&#13;
  innovative because it subjects the ASF to commitments with the agency specializing in these matters.&#13;

  commission that receives audit reports&#13;
&#13;
  The Joint Accounts Review Commission (ComisiÃ³n Mixta Revisora de Cuentas, CMRC), which reports to&#13;
  the National Chamber of Deputies and the National Senate, kept a policy of secrecy. It did not actively&#13;
  provide any type of information on its work. Furthermore, it refused the requests from CSOs for access&#13;
  to the minutes of its meetings, although that was provided for in the rules of Congress. At the same time,&#13;
  it also refused requests to access the Commissionâ&#128;&#153;s meetings. After having submitted two requests to&#13;
  access the minutes of meetings without receiving an answer from the CMRC, ACIJ filed a legal action of&#13;
  amparo (which demands the protection of a constitutional guarantee) to receive the minutes of the past&#13;
  and future meetings. The courts ruled in ACIJâ&#128;&#153;s favor and ordered CMRC to hand over the meeting minutes.&#13;
&#13;
  After another filing by ACIJ, in 2006, the courts instructed the CMRC to hold their meetings publicly and&#13;
  to announce the date, time and place of the meetings on the Internet.&#13;
&#13;
  After several requests for information made by ACIJ that received no answer, the CMRC published in&#13;
  the Senateâ&#128;&#153;s website its regulations, its budget allocation and execution, and the details indicating the&#13;
  dates of each of the transactions associated with the Investment Account (execution of the budget).*&#13;

  Box 5.â&#128;&#130; Dominican Republic: Civil Societyâ&#128;&#153;s Proposal on the Appointment of Members of the&#13;
  Accounts Chamber&#13;
&#13;
  In July 2008, the Senate of the Dominican Republic removed one of the members of the Accounts Cham-&#13;
  ber. The rest of the members resigned in view of the possibility of suffering a similar fate. As a result,&#13;
  numerous Dominican CSOs urged that, given the seriousness of the events that gave rise to the removal&#13;
  and the resignations (claims of irregularities, corruption, and unjustified pay raises), it was necessary to&#13;
  design a transparent and participatory mechanism to appoint their replacements. The process should&#13;
  consider making the CVs of the candidates and their income and assets declarations publicly available.&#13;
  The CSOs also called on citizens, in general, to actively collaborate in the process to prevent a repetition&#13;
  of the events that had lead to the replacement of the members of the Accounts Chamber.&#13;

&#13;
  South Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s Superior Audit Office recently incorporated a system whereby citizens may request the&#13;
  conduction of certain audits in areas suspected of irregularities or corrupt actions. The system has been&#13;
  broadly disseminated in Korean society and has been receiving a growing number of requests. At the&#13;
  same time, a committee has been established to assess the quality of proposals brought forward by CSOs&#13;
  or citizens. Initially it was formed by four Auditor Generals and three civil society experts. Furthermore,&#13;
  the ratio of representation was later reversed (four members appointed at the proposal of citizens and&#13;
  three Auditor Generals), with the aim of making the system more open.*&#13;

  In 2003 the SAI passed a resolution establishing a mechanism that can be used by citizens (individually&#13;
  or through organizations),officials, and servants to exercise the right to file complaints before the Office&#13;
  of the Comptroller General. Pursuant to the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s resolution, the target of the complaints can be&#13;
  actions or operations that are suspected as a result of acts or omission related to the undue, illegal, or&#13;
  inefficient management and/or use of State assets or resources. The agency is banned from disclosing&#13;
  data or information that could endanger the complainant. Once the admissibility of the complaint has&#13;
  been determined, the agency is obliged to process it and verify the facts. The Comptroller is required&#13;
  to communicate to the complainant the results of the process. As per the resolution itself indicates, as a&#13;
  result of this mechanism, the Comptroller will benefit from the participation of civil society.*&#13;

       Box 9.â&#128;&#130; Argentina: Participatory Process to Select Agencies or Programs to be Included in the&#13;
       Annual Audit Plan&#13;
&#13;
       In 2005, the President of the National Audit Office (AuditorÃ­a General de la NaciÃ³n, AGN) informally&#13;
       implemented an initiative through which the CSOs that had maintained some kind of relationship with the&#13;
       agency were called to become part of a process whereby they could petition for the inclusion of programs&#13;
       or agencies in the annual audit plan. The first meeting included a presentation of the initiative and an official&#13;
       of the institution gave an introduction to the external oversight system and the type of audits that were&#13;
       carried out, and detailed the type of proposals that could be presented by the CSOs. At the same time,&#13;
       he made himself available to respond to any concerns that might emerge on the part of the organizations&#13;
       between that time and the second meeting, when the organizations could submit their proposals. At the&#13;
       second meeting, the representatives of the CSOs presented the proposals they had prepared. The AGN&#13;
       officials made an assessment of each and explained whether, based on technical reasons, the initiative&#13;
       was feasible, whether it was already included in the plan for the following year, whether the agency had&#13;
       already been audited in the immediately preceding years, or if the proposal needed to be redrafted.&#13;
       After these observations, the proposals were presented to the Board of Auditors, who decided on their&#13;
       inclusion in the future plan. One of the most visible results of the process consisted in the introduction&#13;
       of an analysis of accessibility for people with physical disabilities to the buildings of each of the agencies&#13;
       to be audited. This proposal was presented by a CSO devoted to promoting the rights of people with&#13;
       disabilities. It should be noted that the AGN had promised the attendants that it would provide written&#13;
       feedback related to the assessment of each proposal, but failed to comply with this commitment. Such a&#13;
       document would be recommendable in the context of these types of experiences, because it represents&#13;
       a response to the petitions filed and a justification regarding those that were turned down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     cy, in regard to each public issue being debat-             reasons, it is valuable to incorporate CSOs in&#13;

       According to the Superior Accounts Tribunal itself, the experience of engaging citizens and civil organiza-&#13;
       tions in the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s audits between August 2007 and March 2008 had very satisfactory results. A recent&#13;
       quantitative assessment indicated that such participation made it possible to detect 186 internal control&#13;
       deficiencies and make 199 management and 23 legality recommendations. Furthermore, 41 findings&#13;
       generated 155 civil liabilities for over US$1.6 million; representing 64 percent of the total detected by&#13;
       the Superior Accounts Tribunal.&#13;
&#13;
       According to the Tribunal, â&#128;&#156;the establishment of effective and dynamic relations between institutional&#13;
       oversight and citizens implies, on the part of the auditor, adopting an attitude sensitive to dialogue, as&#13;
       well as a broad disposition towards an understanding of the social issues underlying the services delivered&#13;

&#13;
  Article 270 of the National Constitution establishes that the â&#128;&#156;The Law will organize the ways and systems&#13;
  for citizen participation to take place in a manner that allows for oversight of public management at the&#13;
  various administrative levels and regarding its outcomes.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
  Two laws (passed in 1994 and 2003)* regulated the concept of â&#128;&#152;citizen oversight committees,â&#128;&#153; which are&#13;
  democratic forms of representation that allow citizens and various community organizations to exercise&#13;
  oversight on public management processes involving administrative, political, judicial, electoral, and&#13;
  legislative authorities. To be eligible, a committee must have members with the technical skills required&#13;
  to undertake particular projects (lawyers to examine contracts, engineers to evaluate constructions, and&#13;
  so forth).&#13;
&#13;
  From 1999 (the year when the Citizen Participation in Fiscal Control Program was launched by the CGR)&#13;
  to 2003, the CGR promoted the Citizen Oversight Committees (ComitÃ©s de Vigilancia Ciudadana, CVC),&#13;
  as a form of citizen audit.Â§ Later, with the passing of Law 850 in 2003, the possibility opened up for Citizen&#13;
  Oversight Committees to apply to the CGR, through an exceptional way of control (control exercised over&#13;
  territorial resources), for conducting audits of departmental or municipal agencies that manage national&#13;
  resources. Currently, the Citizen Oversight Committees contribute to the audits processes performed by&#13;
  the CGR through the filing of complaints.â&#128; &#13;

&amp;#12;About the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice&#13;
Governance is one of seven priority themes in the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s recently launched renewal strat-&#13;
egyâ&#128;&#148;a strategy that responds to client demand for peer-to-peer learning by grounding WBIâ&#128;&#153;s work in the&#13;
distillation and dissemination of practitioner experiences. The Institute is committed to building knowledge&#13;
and capacity on the â&#128;&#156;how toâ&#128;&#157; of governance reforms, with emphasis on supporting and sustaining multi-&#13;
stakeholder engagement in bringing about such reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WBIâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice works with partners, including networks of country and regional institutions, to&#13;
develop and replicate customized learning programs. Its programmatic approach aims at building multi-&#13;
stakeholder coalitions and in creating collaborative platforms and peer networks for knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
The Practice focuses on three thematic areas: governance of extractive industries, procurement reform,&#13;
and access to information. A fourth program supports anti-corruption programs for Parliamentarians, the&#13;
Judiciary and the Private Sector. A Mobilizing Stakeholders for Reform group links stakeholder groups in&#13;
support of these priority areas, documents and codifies knowledge, and builds capacity in cross-cutting&#13;
areas. And lastlyâ&#128;&#148;but importantlyâ&#128;&#148;a Leadership Development Program focuses on strengthening the ca-&#13;
pacity of potential leaders to harness the energies of stakeholder groups and to and channel these efforts&#13;
toward reform.&#13;

            Access to public information and citizen
            participation in supreme audit institutions (SAI) : guide to
            good practices
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            External oversight agencies perform a
            fundamental role in monitoring the exercise of power in
            democratic regimes, especially in countries characterized by
            high corruption rates and inefficiency in public management.
            Despite their importance, however, they do not usually have
            strong links to society. This document highlights the
            importance of access to public information in these external
            oversight agencies and the consequent use of such
            information in the promotion of participatory mechanisms in
            the oversight work conducted by supreme audit institutions
            (SAI). As evidenced in this document, such practices can be
            generated from the audit institutions towards society
            (top-down) as well as from society towards these agencies
            (bottom-up). It should be noted that it is still too early
            to identify particularly successful practices, since in most
            cases these are incipient experiences that are currently
            being implemented, and began only a short time ago. It is
            also worthwhile noting that the experiences compiled in this
            document come from various countries, with special emphasis
            in Latin America.
