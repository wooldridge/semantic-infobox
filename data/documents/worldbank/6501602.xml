INTERNATIONA1. MIGRANT WORKERS' REMITTANCES: ISSUES AND PROSPECTS&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
This paper presents the-results of the first stage of Enalyris of&#13;
the data on international migrant workers' remittances. The results are&#13;
preliminary; further work may be done to improve the anialysis.&#13;
The study puts together available data on workers' remittances to&#13;
developing countries and analyzes the regional structure o! and growth in&#13;
these flows.  It is shown that these flows are substantial.   For many labor&#13;
exporters, they are a major source of foreign exchange earnings. Remittances&#13;
have grown at high rates, particularly in those countries that have exported&#13;
labor to the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries.&#13;
The paper relates the flow of remittances to the level of-and&#13;
fluctuations in economic activity and to inflation in the host countries; the&#13;
results of the empirical analysis show that these latter variables explain a&#13;
large part of the variation in remittance flows. For a subsample of three&#13;
countries, the study attempts to assess, through regression analysis, the&#13;
effects of relative rates of return on savings, of incentive schemes in the&#13;
home countries, and of demographic faccors on the flow of remittances.&#13;
Based on these results and on a qualitative assessment of past&#13;
migration patterns and of the recent experiences and policies of labor&#13;
importers in Europe, the study attempts to forecast future demand for migrant&#13;
labor and the likely growth in remittances.&#13;

OVERVIEW&#13;
The literat';re on inLernational migration ia substantial.  It deals&#13;
with the history of major population movements in several countries and&#13;
continents in the past, with the micro-economics of supply, and with the&#13;
measurement of benefits and costs of emigration to the home country. This&#13;
paper attempts to sLuCy some of the iGsues that have not been analyzed&#13;
systemati-'l'y in the literature, although occasional references exist.   These&#13;
issues generally deal with the effects of emigration on the balance of&#13;
payments.  Specifically, the paper studies different aspects of the flow of&#13;
remittances; that is, the flow of foreign exchange, which is at a social&#13;
premium in most developing countries.   We attempt to understand the regional&#13;
structure of and growth in these flows in different parts of the world.   We&#13;
show that recorded remittance flows are substantial: A sample of developing&#13;
countries of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, South and Western Africa, and&#13;
Central and South America recorded about US$23 billion ["billion" is&#13;
equivalent to "thousand million"] in remittances in 1978; this is about 10% of&#13;
the value of their exports of goods and services.   In many countries, Lhese&#13;
remittances equal 50% to 80% of their merchandise exports.&#13;
The flow of remittances is affected by a number of factors. The&#13;
results of empirical analysis in this study show that the level of and&#13;
cyclical fluctuations in economic activity in the host countries explain 702&#13;
to 95Z of the variation in remittances flowing into labor-exporting&#13;
countries.  A more detailed analysis of remittance flows into Greece,&#13;
Yugoslavia, and Turkey shows that the number of migrant workers abroad and&#13;
their wages together explain over 90Z of the variation in inflow of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
remittances into these countries. Surprisingly (perhaps), relative rates of&#13;
return on savings in the host and home countries, and incentive schemes (in&#13;
the home country) such as the foreign exchange deposit scheme and the premium&#13;
exchange rate, do not appear to have a significant impact on total&#13;
remittances. These initial results tecd to dispute the conventional belief&#13;
that incentives offered by the home countries have a significant impact on&#13;
total remittances. However, the incentives may lead to some reallocation of&#13;
savings since there is evidence that deposits under the foreign exchange&#13;
schemes have increased. It is also shown that the proxy for demographic&#13;
variables such as length of actual or expected stay, and the number of&#13;
dependents at home, have some influence on per capita remittances.&#13;
Based on these results, an attempt is made to predict the likely,&#13;
future growt;h in remittances. Since the number of workers and their wages are&#13;
the most important determinants of remittanc"s, the future growth in demand&#13;
for labor is assessed in a qualitative way, although there is no attempt to&#13;
specify a complete model of labor migration. It is suggested that demand for&#13;
migrant workers is unlikely to increase substantially at the existing poles of&#13;
immigration. Therefore, unless new centers of immigration develop, it appears&#13;
likely that remittances will stabilize; that is, grow at the same rate as&#13;
wages in the host country. Per capita remittances may decline as (and if)&#13;
workers are increasingly integrated into the host society.&#13;
It is fruitful to ask whether other sources of foreign exchange and,&#13;
more importantly, of employment and income can be found; specifically, can&#13;
trade and investment capital movements compensate for labor movements?&#13;
Although this paper takes only a cursory look at the direction and magnitude&#13;
of trade and capital movements from labor-receiving countries, it is clear&#13;
that there are many coustraints that make it difficult to substitute trade or&#13;
~~~~~~~~ I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
capital movements for labor movements. Empirically, there is little evidence&#13;
that labor-receiving countries actively encourage trade with the labor&#13;
exporters or that private direct investment is directed toward countries that&#13;
are supplying labor. Nor is it entirely clear that such bilateral&#13;
substitution would be efficient globally.&#13;

I. THE STRUCTURE OF AND GROWTH IN WORKERS' REMITTANCES&#13;
ihis chapter discusses the limitations and shortcomings of the data&#13;
base of the study and definitional'problems. Despite these limitations, an&#13;
attempt is made to identify the principal movements of migrant labor and to&#13;
estimate the level of and growth in remittance flows.&#13;
A.  Data Limitations&#13;
Data on both migration and remittances are incomplete and&#13;
discontinuous.  Although the major poles of immigration and the associated&#13;
countries of emigration can be identified, there are many regions,&#13;
particularly in Africa and South America, where migration statistics are poor&#13;
and data on remittances non-existent.   Some developed countries (for example,&#13;
the United Kingdom) do not distingiish between workers' remittances and other&#13;
private transfers.&#13;
A second shortcoming of the data on migration is that it is not&#13;
generally easy to distinguish between permanent immigrants and temporary&#13;
migrants.  This problem arises in particular in the case of the United States&#13;
and Canada, which are still the major ir 'Oration countries.   During 1950-77,&#13;
permanent legal immigrants into the United States totaled 12.3 million. In&#13;
addition, large numbers of foreigners were admitted under temporary visas&#13;
("non-immigrant aliens"), which allowed them to work for a few months or&#13;
years. Canada also admits non-immigrants (about 100,000 a year) for temporary&#13;
emiployment for a period up to 12 months - these consist largely of unskilled&#13;
farm and restaurant workers.  The United States also has large inflows of&#13;
I &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
illegal migrants (estimated to be about 8.2 million in 1975), mostly Mexicans,&#13;
and usually for temporary stay.-/&#13;
There are only a few other countries that permit large-scale&#13;
permanent immigration today, and therefore they do not present the same&#13;
problem of distinguishing between permanent and temporary migrants. Venezuela&#13;
and Argentina encouraged immigration, particularly from Europe, in the 1950s&#13;
and 1960s. Even more recently (following the boom in petroleum revenues2/)&#13;
Venezuela has encouraged immigration of skilled workers from Europe.  France&#13;
and the United Kingdom have offered special Immigration rights to citizens of&#13;
their former colonies.&#13;
The conceptual difference between permanent and temporary migrants&#13;
is not, unfortunately, of only academic interest.  The consumption, savings,&#13;
and remittance habits of the two groups may be substantially different since&#13;
the length of stay, the nature of the visa, and the number of dependents that&#13;
a migrant has in the host/home country can all affect the propensity to remit&#13;
money to the home country. Unfortunately, records of remittances into the&#13;
emigrant country do not, as a rule, distinguish between the two sources of&#13;
funds, and therefore any attempt to analyze workers' remittances must suffer&#13;
from the non-specificity of both migrE.tion data (even when available) and the&#13;
inadequacy of data on remittances.&#13;
A third problen is that is impossible to obtain a matrix of&#13;
bilateral flows of remittances. It is generally impossible to estimate from&#13;

the published data on the balance of payments (for either the emigrant or&#13;
immigrant country), the country shares of total outflows or inflows.    It is&#13;
possible only to analyze total outflows from a labor-importing country,&#13;
regardless of destination, or the total inflow into e labor-exporting country,&#13;
regardless of source. While this problem is less crucial for the analysis of&#13;
trends over time and the effects on the balance of payments, the consequences&#13;
become more severe when we attempt to identify the economic determinants of&#13;
remittance inflows into the labor-exporting countries.&#13;
B.  Definition of Workers' Remittances&#13;
The major sourze of data on remittances is the International&#13;
Monetary Fund (IME) balance-of-payments data.   The data are not available for&#13;
many of the emigrant countries, or are available for only a few years.    It is&#13;
important to note, however, that the IMF and the World Bank define workers'&#13;
renittances somewhat differently.   The IMF identifies three categories of&#13;
financial flows associated with migr:.nts, onl; one of which is called workers'&#13;
remittances.  Labor income is the factor income aczruing to temporary laborers&#13;
(staying less than 12 moniths) working abroad.  Work.rs' remittances is the&#13;
value of the private transfers from workers residing abroad for more than a&#13;
year.  Migrants transfers are a set of counter entries to the flows of goods&#13;
and changes in fi,.ancial assets that arise from migration (change of&#13;
residence) and are thus equal to the net worth of migrants.3/ In principle,&#13;
all household and personal effects of migrants, together with such movable&#13;
capital goods as are actually transferred, should be included in "merchandise"&#13;
exports (imports), and correspunding offsets made under migrants transfers.&#13;
International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Manual (Washington, D.C.,&#13;
_~~~17)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
In practice, however, there appears to be no systematic recording of&#13;
tnese different transactions by most of the less developed labor exporters.&#13;
Typically, they have no data under migrants transfers.   It is not clear&#13;
whether this is because the necesnary counter-entries are not recorded or&#13;
because the emigrants from tnese countries do not transfer their physical and&#13;
V          financial assets.  Sezord, it is not clear that these countries distinguish&#13;
between labor income and w3rkers' remittance as explained above.   Given the&#13;
limitations of the data, therefore, for the overall analysis the data in all&#13;
three categories were aggregated. (This conforms to the World Bank definition&#13;
ot workers' remittances.)  For the second part of the analysis, which attempts&#13;
to estimate the influence of financial and policy variables on remittances for&#13;
a selected sample of three countries, a more careful study is made of the&#13;
different flows.&#13;
C.  The Magnitude of and Growth in Remittance Flows into&#13;
Major Labor-Exporting Countries&#13;
The major poles of immigration and the associated countries of&#13;
emigration are shuwn in Table 1.  Even given the inadequacy of data (which is&#13;
particularly acute for Central and South America and Africa); in 1978 about&#13;
$24 billion were rucorded to have been transferred i. -im labor-receiving&#13;
countries to labor-exporting count:ies kTable 2).4/  (In contrast, in 1968&#13;
only about q3 billion constituted remittance inflows.) This is a substantial&#13;
flow: it i. equivalent to about 13% of the value of exports of goods and about&#13;
39% of the value of exports of non-factor services from the sample countries.&#13;
For particular countries, the share of these flows in their foreign&#13;
exchange earnings is very large, as can be seen in Table 3. In 1978-79, the&#13;

Appendix A. Note also that the data for the year 1968 are paiticularly&#13;
weak for the non-European countries.&#13;

percentage of remittances to exports (of merchandise) was 42.5% for&#13;
Yugoslavia, 76.7% for Turkey, 68.9% for Portugal, a: 51.3% for Morocco.&#13;
Remittances have also been important for many countries in the Middle East.&#13;
The percentage of remittances to exports was 88.0% for Egypt; for Yemen&#13;
People's Democratic Republic, Yemen Arab Republic, and Jordan, remittances&#13;
were practically the only source of foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
The percentage of remittances to exports was 76.5% for Pakistan,&#13;
15.0% for India, 59.6% for Upper Volta, and 33.0% for Mali.    In contrast and&#13;
as can be expected, workers' remittance outflows from the labor-importing&#13;
countries are not significant in terms of their total imports.    In 1978-79,&#13;
this ratio was only 4.4% for Germany, 4.6% for France, 7.8% for Switzerland,&#13;
0.63% for the U.S., and 8.6% for South Africa.&#13;
The growth in the nominal value of these remittance has differel&#13;
widely, as can be seen in Table 4.5/   In E rope, the trend of growth ranged&#13;
between 9% and 11% per year during 1960-79 for the traditional labor exporters,&#13;
that is, Algeria, Greece, and Italy. For the "new" labor exporters -&#13;
Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Portugal - the growth rate was over 15%.    This&#13;
reflects the changing nationality composition of the foreign labor force in&#13;
Europe.  In particular, remittances into Italy have grown at only 9.5% per&#13;
year, and there is evidence that Italy is now a net labor importer.&#13;
Remittances into Algeria have also grown slowly, reflecting its prospects for&#13;
domestic development.   Remittances into Tunisia and Morocco have grown at over&#13;
20%, because of an increased number of workers emigrating to the oil-rich Arab&#13;
countries.&#13;
The trend rates of growth in remittances have been estimated by regressing&#13;
remittances on a time-trend. See Appendix B on statistical procedures.&#13;

II. THE EFFECTS ON REMITTANCES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVLTY IN THE HOST COUNTRY&#13;
In this chapLer we attempt to measure the relationship betueen&#13;
economic activity, nominal wages, and remittance flows. Two channels of&#13;
influence can opecate. First, the rate of growth of the host economy and the&#13;
cycles in economic activity affect demand for migrant labor.   This demand,&#13;
however, is constrained by imitgration quotas. Consequently, a limited number&#13;
of foreign workers are permitted to enter or remain in the country. However,&#13;
we can assume that the immigration quota is responsive to excess demand&#13;
conditions in the labor market.   If we assume further that the supply of&#13;
migrant labor (to the labor importer) is infinitely elastic, then the growth&#13;
of and fluctuations in economic activity determine the total number of migrant&#13;
workers in the economy.&#13;
Second, the rate of inflation in the host economy affects the&#13;
nominal value of remittances. Inflation in the host economy usually increases&#13;
remittances because changes in nominal wages tend to correspond to price&#13;
changes.&#13;
A third set of factors needs to be considered if we attempt to&#13;
explain not total remittance outflows from a labor-importing country but&#13;
remittance inflows into a particular labor-exporting country.   This is because&#13;
the supply of labor from a particular country is not infinitely elastic. It&#13;
depends, given demand, on wage rates in the home country relative to wage&#13;
rates in the host country, and on the perceived financial and psychic costs of&#13;
migration.&#13;
A complete model that analyzes all these influences on remittance&#13;
payments and receipts would therefore have to be quite complex and would&#13;
require a detailed specification of labor demand, supply, and wage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
determination. This is beyond the scope of this Paper. The study is limit 1&#13;
to the analysis of remittances and therefore takes the migration patterns and&#13;
wages as given. (Our perceptions of future demand for migrant labor in&#13;
Chapter IV are based only on.a qualitative assessment of the recent&#13;
experiences and policy decisions of labor importers in Europe and the Middle&#13;
East.)&#13;
A.  The Model&#13;
The basic model is&#13;
Ri = f (NOWORKij, EARNj)       ...   ..............              (1)&#13;
where&#13;
Ri = remittance inflows into the labo.r exporting country i;&#13;
NOWORKij = nnmber of workers from country i in the host country(s) J;&#13;
EARNj = per capita nominal wage in the host country(s) j.&#13;
Unfortunately, as explained earlier, time-series data on the numbers&#13;
of workers of different nationalities in the host country(s) are unavailable&#13;
for most countries.    Nominal wage data are also difficult to obtain for the&#13;
non-European host countries, particularly those in the Middle East.          For these&#13;
reasons, we have estimated the following model which relates nominal value of&#13;
remittances to nominal value of gross domestic product (GDP). The estimated&#13;
model is&#13;
Ri   = f (GDPTj, GDPDEVj) .      ...&#13;
where&#13;
GDPTj * the trend level of nominal GDP in the labor-importing&#13;
country's) J.&#13;
GDPDEVJj = the deviation of actual GDP from the trend value of GDP&#13;
expressed as a ratio to the trend value.&#13;
The trend value of nominal GDP is the predictcd value of GDP from a&#13;
regression of GDP on a time variable.&#13;
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Equation (2) is admittedly a crude approximzttion both of equation&#13;
(1) and of the reduced form that would obtain from a complete model. It does&#13;
not distinguish between the effects of real factors and of inflation in the&#13;
hust country on remittances. Further, as compared with equation (1), equation&#13;
(2) is underspecified, since it excludes variables that would capture the&#13;
effect of supply (of labor) factors in the labor-exporting country on the&#13;
number of foreign workers from that country in the labor-importing country.&#13;
This implies that the coefficients of GDPTj and GDPDEVj are biased.&#13;
On the positive side, the model is simple, computationally easy to&#13;
apply to different data sets, and is representative of the basic relationship&#13;
between remittances, economic activity, and nominal wages. Also, it will be&#13;
sho,yn that the bias in the estimated coefficients is systematic and provides&#13;
some iiteLesting information, because in estimating an.under-specified model&#13;
the influence of the variable(s) left out is captured by the independent&#13;
variables that are included. In short, the estimated coefficients of GDPTj&#13;
and GDPDEVj measure the effect of the demand for labor, of wages, and some&#13;
part of the influence of supply factors on the stock of workers from the labor&#13;
exporting country. Since the effect of demand and of wages in the labor-&#13;
receiving country can oe assumed to be the same for all labor exporters (to&#13;
that country), the different values of the coefficients of the included&#13;
variables in the regressions for different labor exporters reflect,&#13;
essentially, different supply responses. The larger the coefficient, the&#13;
larger is the increase in the number of workers from that country (and hence&#13;
remittances from abroad) associated with an increase in demand for labor in&#13;
the host country. Thus, without estimating a supply elasticity, we do obtain&#13;
some measure of the differing effects of supply factors on remittances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
B. Results of Estimation and Discussion&#13;
The estimated regressions are reported in Appendix A. Model (2) was&#13;
estimated without the variable.GDPDEVj for those countries (mostly non-European)&#13;
for which the number of observations was too small. In addition, the variable&#13;
GDPT was replaced by other variables (exports in Southern Africa, government&#13;
expenditures in the Middle East).where they were judged to be better&#13;
indicators of economic activity.   The host country(s) in each case was assumed&#13;
to be the major immigration pole(s) in the area (see Table 1).&#13;
In general, the results indicate that the level of economic activity&#13;
in the host country(s) is an important determinant of remittances. The&#13;
results of e!. imating model (2) for Europe are particularly interesting.&#13;
Because for the major labor-exporting countries in this region data are&#13;
available for relatively long periods (from 13 to 18 years), and therefore&#13;
allow for many more degrees of freedom in the statistical analysis, GDPDEVj&#13;
shows a significant effect on remittances, and GDPT, as can be expected, is&#13;
very significant. Together they explain 80% to 99% of the variation in&#13;
remittance inflows. The countries for which GDPDEV does not turn out to be&#13;
significant are Turkey, Italy, and Algeria. The only country for which the&#13;
variable GDPT is not significant is Cyprus.&#13;
In the regression equations estimated for countries in the Middle&#13;
East and Asia. the explanatory variable is specified to be government&#13;
expenditures (rather than GDP). In the capital-surplus oil-exporting&#13;
countries that import most of the migrant labor in the region, GDP data are&#13;
often unreliable, particularly because of the large oil sectors in these&#13;
countries. Data on government expenditures are usually part of the budget&#13;
documents and are therefore more reliable. (In the regression equations for&#13;
the African countries excluding Algeria, T;nisia, and Morocco, exports appear&#13;
as the explanatory varirble.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Because of the smaller number of observations, the GDPDEV variable&#13;
was left out in all the equations estimated for the labor exporters in the&#13;
Middle East, Asia, and Southern and Western Africa.    The results indicate that&#13;
government expenditures in the host countries explain 83% to 97% of the&#13;
variation in remittances into the Middle East, and 74% to 95% of the variation&#13;
in -emittances into Asian countries.&#13;
Two summary statistics were calculated from these estimated&#13;
regressions. First, the elasticit:' of remittances into a labor-exporting&#13;
country with respect to GDPT growth in the host country was derived. Second,&#13;
an estimate was made of the effect of a 1% positive cyclical deviation in GDPT&#13;
of the host country on remfttances into the labor-exportLig country.A/    The&#13;
second statistic is, of course, relevant only to those equations that include&#13;
GDPDEV as an explanatory variable and estimate a significant coefficient for&#13;
the variable.&#13;
These statistics are given in Table 5. Consider first the&#13;
slasticity of remittances with respect to GDPT (or government expenditures in&#13;
the Middle East and exports in Southern Africa). Among the European labor&#13;
exporters, this elasticity is high for the new labor exporters, that is,&#13;
Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Portugal.   The share of laborers from these countries&#13;
in the migrant labor force in the labor-importing countries of Europe has&#13;
grown substantially over the years.   These elasticities thereÂ£ore reflect the&#13;
larger supply response from these countries that is associated with an&#13;
increase in demand.   In contrast, the elasticity is low for the traditional&#13;
labx: exporters, that is, Greece, Italy, and Algeria, whose share in the total&#13;
migrant labor force is declining. The elasticities for Morocco, Tunisia, and&#13;
For details of these derivations, see Appendix B on statistical&#13;

Spain are higher thaa those for the traditional exporters, but lower than&#13;
those for the new exporters in Europe. It seems therefore that the bias&#13;
introduced by estimating the model (2) is systematic and, in fact, provides&#13;
fairly useful information.   These elasticities show that changes in the level           --&#13;
of economic activity will affect remittances into the new exporters&#13;
considerably more than remittances into the traditional ones.&#13;
The impact of cyclical activity is significant for Yugoslavia,&#13;
Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal, Morocco, and Tunisia. The largest effects&#13;
seem to be on remittances into Yugoslavia, Portugal, and Morocco.&#13;
Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Pakistan, and India show fairly high&#13;
elasticities of remittances with respect to government expenditures, although&#13;
these elasticities are lower than those obtained for the new labor exporters&#13;
of Europe.&#13;
The three countries dependent on South African mines for their:labor&#13;
income show high elasticities.   This is not surprising since a large part of&#13;
the wages of these laborers accrues to them in the form of deferred pay,.which&#13;
is available only when the workers leave the mines at the end of the contract.-&#13;
Of the South American countries, sufficient data are available unly&#13;
for three countries, Mexico, Jamaica, and Colombia, and all of them show very&#13;
high elasticities with respect to GDPT.&#13;
C.  Outflow of Remittances from the Labor-Importing Countries:&#13;
Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland&#13;
As pointed out earlier, the supply of labor to a particular labor-&#13;
importing country is likely to be infinitely elastic.   Therefore the model&#13;
specified in equation (2) can be correctly applied to a labor-importing&#13;
country since total outflow of remittanc_s from the country depends on the&#13;
total stock of foreign workers ir the country (irrespective of nationality),&#13;
which is determined entirely by demand factors in the host country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Equation (2) was estimated with data on remittance outflows from&#13;
Germany, F.R. and Switzerland. The elasticity of remittance outflows with&#13;
respect to GDPT is 1.49 for Germany and 1.17 for 'witzerland.   The variable&#13;
GDPDEV is signiticant,in both the equations as well; it is estimated that a 1%&#13;
positive cyclical fluctuation leads to an increase of $67 million and $16.1&#13;
million in remittance outflows from Germany and Switzerland, respectively.&#13;
(The estimated equations are given in Appendix A.)&#13;
The average elacticity of remittance outflows for Germany (1.49) can&#13;
be compared with the elasticity of remittance inflows for some of the labor-&#13;
exporting countries in Table 5.   The elasticities for Yugoslavia and Turkey&#13;
are, respectively, 22% and 12. higher than the average elasticity of outflows&#13;
from Germany. In contrast, the elasticities for Greece, Italy, and Spain are,&#13;
respectively, 78.5%, 59%, and 91Z of the elasticity of remittance outflows&#13;
from Germany.  These results further substantiate our initial hypothesis that&#13;
there are differences in the supply responses of labor-exporting countries and&#13;
that these differences are correctly reflected in the coefficients estimated&#13;
for the individual countries.&#13;

UII.  DETERMINANTS OF RFMITTANCE INFLOWS:&#13;
A COMPLEVE SPECIFICATION&#13;
In Chapter II, we explored the basic relationship between indicators&#13;
of economic activity in the host country and remittance flows into labcr-&#13;
exporting countries.  In this chapter, a more detailed analysis of other&#13;
factors :.hich may influence remittance flows is undertaken.&#13;
A.  Identification of Determinants&#13;
This section identifies variables that reflect the demographic&#13;
characteristics and economic environment of migrant workers which may be&#13;
expected to influence remittance inflows into labor-exporting countries. A&#13;
typical siort-term migrant is supposed to be a "target-saver," that is, the&#13;
primary motive for hi, emigration is assumed to be the accumulation of some&#13;
target amount of savings as quickly as possible, after which the migrant&#13;
returns home in order to eiiminatz tjhe "psychic" costs of being away.&#13;
Modifications to this basic model are possible, of course. The longer the&#13;
migrant stays or expects to stay, the more integrated he may be assumed to&#13;
become in the social and economic life of the immigrant country and the less&#13;
likely he may be to send remittances homa regularly.   In the extreme case of a&#13;
perman-r: immigrant who has or expects to have his family with him,&#13;
remittances may cease altogether.&#13;
Even given these motivations, however, at any given time t.i_&#13;
immigrant has the option of keeping his savings in the immigran. country until&#13;
he leaves (if he leaves) and remitting only a part of them. If we control for&#13;
the personal circumstances of the individual migrant, remittances may&#13;
therefore be influenced by financial variables such as: (a)    the relative real&#13;
rates rf return in the two countries on financial and real assets, (b)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
exchange rate policies, and (c)   any policies in the emigrant country that&#13;
offer incentives for remittances.   We attempt to estimate t"ie effects of these&#13;
variables on remittances.&#13;
The data base is a cross-section of time-series data an three&#13;
countries - Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece - for the years 1962-79. These&#13;
three countries account for nearly 607 of the migrant labor force in&#13;
Germany. Converbely, 87% of Greek migrant workers, 78% of lurkish migrant&#13;
workers, and 62% of Yugoslav migrant workers in Europe are in Germany.&#13;
It is hypothesized that differences in the rates of return on&#13;
financial and re.Jl assets between Germany and each of these countries has some&#13;
influence on workers' decisions to remit. Further, each of these countries&#13;
has had special schemes to attract remittances. In Yugoslavia, it was&#13;
possible as early as 1959 to obtain "authorization" to open a foreign currency&#13;
account. in 1966-67, the process was liberalizei greatly, and the number of&#13;
accounts increased from about 109,000 in 1966 to 1.1 million in 1971, when&#13;
further liberalization occurred, and to 2.2 million in 1974.7/&#13;
The interest on these deposits was paid in foreign exchange and has&#13;
increased from 6.0% in 1966 to 9.0% in 1979.8/ This rate has been comparable&#13;
to the rate Yugoslav banks pay on local currency deposits because the National&#13;
Bank of Yugoslavia guarantees the commercial banks against financial losses by&#13;
compensating the commercial banks when the dinar exchange rate depreciatea.&#13;
These interest rates have been at least a couple of percentage points higher&#13;
than the comparable rate on savings deposits in Germany.&#13;
7/  Ivo Baucic, "Some Consequences of Yugoslav External Migration" (Zagreb,&#13;
Yugoslavia: Center for Migration Studies, 1975; mimeo).   The number of&#13;
accounts excee's the number of workers abroad in recent years, suggesting&#13;
that non-emigrants also hold these deposits.&#13;
-/ On savings deposits of a year's duration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
In addition, holders of foreign currency accounts are given&#13;
preference for importing consumer durables (like automobiles) and utilize&#13;
their funds freely for traveling and buying abroad.   They also had a special&#13;
advantage in obtaining loans (in dinars) for building apartments or houses,&#13;
for building or remodeling busness premises, and for purchasing equipment&#13;
needed to open or expand busineqs.&#13;
Since the beginning of 1972, holders of foreign currency accounts&#13;
have also had the opportunity to buy bonds issued against foreign currency;&#13;
these bonds have generally carried . higher interest rate than foreign&#13;
currency accounts.  Small business ventures may issue these bonds, and the&#13;
buyers may enjoy other benefits, including employment'with the company.&#13;
Greek citizens (seamen and workers) abroad have been able to hold&#13;
foreign currency accounts since 1968.  In 1979 balances on these accounts&#13;
earned 3% interest on sight-deposits, up to 9.5% on time deposits, and 7% on&#13;
savings deposits.  Balances on these accounts, including accrued interest,&#13;
were freely convertible into foreign exchange as long as the holder continued&#13;
to work abroad or to serve at sea and for 3-5 years thereafter.9/   Somewhat&#13;
similar provisions applied to a Housing Loan Deposit Scheme for seamen and&#13;
workers. 1!/&#13;
9/  It is not clear whether the Greek banks compensate depositors for&#13;
exchange-rate depreciation.&#13;
0/ These deposits are treated as short-term capital inflows and are not&#13;
included in workers' remittances. If the depcsits are withdrawn in&#13;
foreign currency, the amount withdrawn is treated as a capital outflow.&#13;
The amounts withdrawn in local currency are treated as a remittance inflow&#13;
in the balance of current accounts. For our purposes therefore, we have&#13;
added to the recorded workers' remittances, net increases in foreign&#13;
exchange deposits as given in the capital account of the balance of&#13;
payments. This is not entirely appropriate since se are interested in&#13;
credits to deposits (which correspond to .orkers' remittance inflows).&#13;
However, separate data on credits and debits are not readily available,&#13;
and even the net increases in tt-se deposits ($592 million in 19'77, for&#13;
example) are large enough to make it desirable to account for these&#13;
deposits In some way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
In Turkey, workers abroad have been able toi open foreign exchange&#13;
accounts with the Central Bank of Turkey since about 1969. The interest rate&#13;
on these deposits was the same as on domestic currency deposits; that is,&#13;
6.5% on one year deposits in 1969, 9% in 1974, ail 12% in 1978. In May 1979,&#13;
the interest rate was raised to 20.0% and, for the first time, a 10-15&#13;
percentage point bonus was offered on deposits of foreign exchange by&#13;
workers. Turkey has also offered what amounts to premium exchange rates for&#13;
workers' ienittances. They could be exchanged at the par rate (or a special&#13;
race in somc years), and an additional deposit ranging from 27 to 40% of the&#13;
value of the remittance would be credited to the account c,' the remitter if he&#13;
deposited his money in a commercial bank account.   There do not appear to have&#13;
been any restrictions on subsequent withdrawal of the deposit, this scheme&#13;
seems to have worked as a premium exchange rate scheme.&#13;
Turkey has also offered its workers living abroad special privileges&#13;
on the import of both consumer goods and machinery. Separate limits and&#13;
conditions have applied to imports of goods for personal use and of&#13;
professional instruments and machines by persons having resided abroad for&#13;
employment or study; these limits and conditions vary with the length of stay&#13;
abroad and with the transfer to Turkey of foreign exchange.1'! The impor,t of&#13;
automobiles can be made freely provided certain conditions are met relating to&#13;
residence abroad and to remittance and sale of foreign exchange to authorized-&#13;
banks in Turkey.&#13;
In general, imports into Turkey are made only after an import license is&#13;
obtained and a foreign exchange allocation is made. Workers living abroad&#13;
are permitted imports (within certain limits) without such an allocation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
wcicmpanies or cooperati-es formed in Turkey by residents temporarily&#13;
working abroad may import investment goods to the extent of the foreign&#13;
exchange investedj.3! In fact, Turkey was the first labor-exporting country&#13;
to try using migrants' remittances for productive investment.  The import&#13;
privileges with respect to machinery and equipment were part of the strategy.&#13;
As early as 1963, "Village Development Cooperatives" were formed and financed&#13;
by workers abroad. To qualify for this scheme, workers had to pay an initial&#13;
fee before emigration, which gave them precedence over others for going&#13;
abroad; this initial fee had to be followed by a series of contributions from&#13;
abroad. The scheme was not very successful, since several cooperatives were&#13;
founded solely for the purpose of emigration.&#13;
An apparently more successful scheme was developed by Turkish&#13;
workers abroad. They formed companies entirely owned by workers and were&#13;
assisted by the German government in the preparation of projects. The German&#13;
government believe.. that these schemes could simultaneously attract savings,&#13;
create jobs in the country of origin of the workers, and facilitate (the&#13;
workers') reintegration into their home economies upon return. In 1973, the&#13;
number of companies established or almost established was 17 (which increased&#13;
to 27 in 1975). The 10 established companies had nearly 20,000 shareholders&#13;
(350 of whom had returned to work in the companies) and employed nearly 1,000&#13;
persons. The initial capital investment was $7.3 million.13'&#13;
12/ These imports of consumer and investment goods are not incltuded in&#13;
migrant's remittances, but are instead recorded as "workers imports" or&#13;
"imports with'waivers" in the capital account.. For our purposes, we have&#13;
added the value of these imports to workers' remittances.&#13;
13/ See Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),&#13;
Migratory Chain (Paris, 1978), pp. 28-31.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
These countries have thus tried incentive schemes to attract&#13;
remittances on a larger scale through official channels. In particular, the&#13;
convertible currency or foreign currency deposit schemes with the associated&#13;
non-interest benefits such as special import privileges are said to have been&#13;
successful in attracting deposits. In Yugoslavia, for example, the net change&#13;
in the value of foreign currency deposits as a proportion of total remittances&#13;
increased from 14.5% in 1967 to 24.1% in 1974. In Greece, this ratio&#13;
increased from 2.8% in 1968 to 38.6% ill 1977. Data are not readily available&#13;
for Turkey; however, it is generally acknowledged that the convertible&#13;
currency accounts were not very successful in attracting deposits, nor were&#13;
the investment schemes. As mentioned above, the total capital investment in&#13;
the workers' companies in Turkey in 1973 was $7.3 million, whereas total&#13;
remittances were close to $1.2 billion. Data on the value of foreign currency&#13;
bonds issued in Yugoslavia are not available, but according to recent&#13;
estimates, only 1,500 jobs were created by 1973 by compinies which issued&#13;
bonds for foreign currency holders.&#13;
There are, of course, several factors which may have the effect of&#13;
discouraging remittances through official channels. Perhaps the most&#13;
important is the general overvaluation of exchange rates, which has resulted&#13;
in active black markets for the hard currencies in which remittances are&#13;
earned. Systematic data on the black-market rates for various currencies in&#13;
relation to the dollar reveal that during the period 1962-79 the difference&#13;
between the black-market and official conversion rate for the Turkish lira,&#13;
14/&#13;
expressed as a percentage of the official rate, was 16.3% on the average.-&#13;
14/ F. Pick, Pick's Currency Yearbook (New York: Pick Publishing Company),&#13;
various issues. The black-market rate is expressed as a ratio to the&#13;
official "premium" rate for workers' remittances in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
rhe ratio averages only 3% for Greece.    On average, the Yugoslav currency was&#13;
overvalued by 9.8%.&#13;
Another variable considered is the real rate of return on real&#13;
estate in the labor-exporting country relative to the return on bank deposits&#13;
in the host country.   It is well known that investment in housing is a&#13;
favorite channel for investment by migrant workers, since the rate of&#13;
appreciation in the value of this asset usually matches (and sometimes&#13;
exceeds) the general rate of inflation in the country. It is hypothesized&#13;
that the higher the real rate of return on these assets, the greater the value&#13;
of remittances.&#13;
Finally, it is hypothesized that the larger the number of dependents&#13;
the migrant worker has with him in the host country, the smaller the&#13;
remittance he sends home. Unfortunately, there are no time-series data on the&#13;
family characteristics of the migrant; the only series available is the number&#13;
of females in the migrant population. The ratio of females to total migrant&#13;
population (of each nationality) is therefore used as a proxy for the&#13;
demographic evolution of the migrant labor force toward the sex-age profile of&#13;
the general population.&#13;
The effects of all the variables discussed above (as well as the&#13;
number of workers and per capita earnings) were estimated in a multiple-&#13;
regression model.   The model, the exact specifications of the variables, and&#13;
the expected signs of the coefficients are explained below.&#13;

C.  Construction of the Variables&#13;
All remittance data are based on reports of the IMF (on balances of&#13;
payments) and OECD.  However, as explained above, the net changes in foreign&#13;
exchange deposits in Greece'and the special imports financed by workers'&#13;
remittances in Turkey, as recorded separately in the capital accounts of those&#13;
countries, are added to remittances to get a more complete series on workers'&#13;
remittances. (In Yugoslavia, deposits into foreign exchange accounts are&#13;
recorded in the current accounts.)&#13;
Data on the number of workers refer, in the case of Yugoslavia, to&#13;
the number of workers in Europe and, in the case of Greece and Turkey, to the&#13;
number of workers in Germany. Since Greek and Turkish workers in Germany&#13;
account for 80% of their labor-force abroad, the number of their workers in&#13;
Germany is used as a proxy for explaining total remittances into these&#13;
countries.  However, only 62U of Yugoslav workers abroad are in Germany;&#13;
therefore the explanatory variable is taken to be the total number of Yugoslav&#13;
workers in Europe, since the dependent variable is total remittances into&#13;
Yugoslavia.&#13;
Per capita earnings are assumed to be the same as the average per&#13;
capita wages for industrial workers in Germany and are the same for all&#13;
nationalities of migrant workers.&#13;
The relative interest rate variable is the ratio of the rate of&#13;
interest on one- to two-year term deposits of foreign currency in the labor-&#13;
exporting country to the rate on comparable maturity deposits in Sermany.    It&#13;
is important to note that the variable has zero values for the earlier years&#13;
in the sample when there was no foreign exchange deposit scheme. The variable&#13;
is therefore a combination of the interest rate variable and a dummy variable&#13;
where the latter stands for the once-over incentives, that is, the non-interest&#13;
benefits generally associated with these deposits as explained in the previous&#13;
s._tion.&#13;

D. Results of the Estimation&#13;
The results of estimating the models (3) and (4) are given in Table 6.15/&#13;
(The table also contains tne results of estimating these equations with a&#13;
smaller number of explanatory variables, which will be discussed later.) In&#13;
the first equation, the number of workers (NOWORK) and per capita wages (EARN)&#13;
turn out to be highly significant. None of the other variables (including the&#13;
cross-section dummies) are significant. The R2 is very high.&#13;
Equation (2) has as the dependent variable per capita remittances&#13;
and therefore the number of workers does not appear as an explanatory&#13;
variable. In this equation EARN and the cross-section dummies turn out to be&#13;
very significant.  The R2 is slightly lower.&#13;
In equations (3) and (4), the relative interest rate with dummy&#13;
variable is replaced by "DUMMY," which takes values equal to zero in all the&#13;
years prior to the introduction of the foreign exchange deposit scheme in a&#13;
country and values equal to I thereafter. This variable therefore excludes&#13;
the interest rate incentives and represents only the non-interest rate&#13;
benefits associated with the deposits. The coefficients of this dummy&#13;
variable are not significant in either equation.   However, in equation (4) the&#13;
coefficient has the right sign, that is, it is positive.   In addition, the&#13;
coefficient of the ratio of females in the migrant population (which has&#13;
appeared with the right sign, that is, negative, in the earlier equations)&#13;
becomes more significant in equation (4).&#13;
Equation (5) and '6) in Table 6 were estimated with a much smaller&#13;
number of variables, NOWORK, EARN, DUMMY, FEMRATIO, and the cross-sectional&#13;
dummies (1 and 2).  As before only the coefficients of NOWORK and EARN are&#13;

significant in (5), while in the equation for per capita remittances (6), in&#13;
addition to EARN, the coefficients of FEMRATIO, and the cross-sectional&#13;
dummies turn out to be significant. The variable DUMMY has the right sign but&#13;
remains insignificant.&#13;
Finally, equations (7) and (8) were estimated with only the relevant&#13;
scale variables and crossu-sectional dummies.  As can be seen, there is no&#13;
appreciable difference in the R2 between this set of equations and equations&#13;
(1) and (2) which included all the variables, or equations (3) and (4) which&#13;
also included all the variables except RELINT which was replaced by DUMMY.&#13;
It seems clear, therefore, that the number of workers and their&#13;
earnings are the most important and perhaps the only easily measurable&#13;
influences on remittances. However, the ratio of females in the migrant&#13;
population, which is a proxy for the maturing age-sex profile of the migrant&#13;
population, does turn out to be significant in equation (6), suggesting that&#13;
per capita remittances decline when the migrant population contains more&#13;
females and possibly more children.&#13;
E.  Discussion of the Coefficients&#13;
The coefficient of NOWORK implies that the addition of one worker to&#13;
the Yugoslav, Greek, or Turkish migrant labor force leads to an increase in&#13;
remittances of between $822 and $932, depending on which equation on total&#13;
remittances is used (this figure is the average for the period; for recenLt&#13;
years, it may be higher). The elasticity of remittances with respect to the&#13;
number of workers and with respect to per capita earnings is given in the&#13;
first two columns, respectively, of Table 7. As can be seen, the elasticity&#13;
of remittances with respect to the number of workers is less than one and&#13;
falls from 0.47 to 0.41 if all the non-scale variables are left out of the&#13;
regression. The elasticity of total remittances to per capita earnings ranges&#13;
between 1.19 and 1.01, depending on the equation considered.&#13;

Note:  All elasticities are computed at the sample means of the variables.&#13;
The fourth column in Table 7 shows the elasticity of per capita&#13;
remittances with respect to per capita earnings as derived from the equations&#13;
of per capita remittances.  These are not strictly comparable to the&#13;
elasticities reported in column 2 for two reasons.   First, the dependent&#13;
variable in the first set of equations is total remittances, while column 4 is&#13;
derived fron equations with per capita remittances as the dependent variable.&#13;
To make the two elasticities comparable, therefore, the elasticity of total&#13;
remittances with respect to earnings, with the number of workers held&#13;
constant, must be derived from the equations of per capita remittances-&#13;
These are reported in column 3 as niREARN*.&#13;
A     This was done quite simply as follows since&#13;
aPCR    _   a(R/NOWORK)&#13;
a EARN         a EARN&#13;
__aR            aPCR   * NOWORK&#13;
a EAFN       a EARN&#13;
Substituting average vaiues of NOWORK, EARN,and R, we have&#13;
1IR,EARN     aPCR    *   NOWORK   * EARN&#13;
where the bar denotes average values of the variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
As can be seen, n R,EARN and n R,EAURN* are quite different.  This&#13;
follows from the fact that the two sets of equa.ions are structurally&#13;
different. In the model describing total remittances, the coefficient of&#13;
NOtIORK is unconstrained and is free to take any value. In the model&#13;
describing per capita remittances, on the other hand, the hypothesis is that&#13;
the elasticity of remittances with respect to the number of workers is 1. In&#13;
other words, in the latter set of equations, it is assumed that an increase in&#13;
the number of workers causes a proportional increase in remittances, other&#13;
things being equal.  The effect of per capita earnings on per capita&#13;
remitcances is therefore estimated with this constraint on the coefficient of&#13;
the varicble NOWORK.&#13;
As can be seen from Table 7 (comparing columns 2 and 3), the effect&#13;
uf constraining the elasticity of the number of workers to be one is that the&#13;
estimated wage elasticities are higher than if the coefficient (and&#13;
elasticity) of NOWORK is unconstrained.   On the other hand, imposing such a&#13;
constraint makes the coefficients of the other explanatory variables more&#13;
significant, that is, the ratio of females to the total migrant population and&#13;
the cross-sectional dummies turn out to be significant (see Table 6).&#13;
The significance of the ratio of females is an important result.   It&#13;
appears that this provides the only confirmation in the literature of the&#13;
hypothesis that per capita remittances decline when the age-sex composition of&#13;
the migrant population matures.17/  The cross-sectional dummies show that the&#13;
constant term in the equation would be smaller for Yugoslavia and Turkey than&#13;
However, if per capita earnings are systematically lower for females than&#13;
for males, this variable may also capture the effect of the increasing&#13;
share of femal-es on average per c-apita earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
for Greece. If we consider equation (6) for example, the constant term would&#13;
be 1.41231 for Yugoslavia and 0.51289 for Turkey, compared with 5.21144 for&#13;
Greece. In a multiple regressiou framework, the constant term should be&#13;
interpreted as the mean effect on the dependent variable of all the omitted&#13;
explanatory variables. In this particular regression, the major omitted&#13;
variable is probably the difference in average per capita earnings between the&#13;
different nationality groups. This difference is not taken into account,&#13;
since we use data on Gerr&amp;Lan per capita wages as the relevant wage variable for&#13;
all three groups. However, Greek workers, who have a longer history of&#13;
residence in Germany than do the other two groups, probably 'earn higher wages&#13;
on the average, while Turkish workers, who are the most recent of the three&#13;
migrant groups, probably have the lowest level of earnings on the average.&#13;
These difference appear to be reflected quite accurately in the relative&#13;
magnitudes of the constant term.&#13;
Because the equations on per capita remittances were more sansitive&#13;
to the. effect of non-scale explanatory variables and provided more -"&#13;
information, this formulation is preferable to the model of total remittances&#13;
for purposes of explanation and projection. The latter model clearly&#13;
demonstrates thaL the number of workers is an important explanatory variable;&#13;
however, we think that the estimated elasticity,   R,NOWORK is probably an&#13;
underestimate.  Theoreticallv, other things being equal, the effect of an&#13;
increase in the number of workers on remittances is proportional; the fact&#13;
that the equation estimates an elasticity which is less than 1 suggests that&#13;
the equation is underspecified in terms of the variables that alter this&#13;
proportionality relationship.   (The ratio of females in the migrant population&#13;
apparently reduces but does not eliminate this bias.)&#13;
&#13;

F. Summary&#13;
This chapter has identified and assessed the effects cf a number of&#13;
variables including the number of workers and per capita earnings on&#13;
remittances. Each of the three countries in the subsample has made efforts to&#13;
attract remittances through official cha-iels. These incentive schemes&#13;
i.,clude fcreign exchange deposit schemes with attractive interest rates,&#13;
special import privileges, premium exchange rates, and special investment&#13;
sche,nes for workers living abroad. L..e factors that might have discouraged&#13;
remittances through official channels are the overvaluation of exchange rates,&#13;
tht increasing length of stay of migrants, and the increasing number of&#13;
dependents in the host country.&#13;
A multiple regression on a pooled sample of data for 18 years and 3&#13;
countries has produced interesting, if sobering, results. Per capita&#13;
remittances appear to grow by 1.23% for every 1% increase in per capita&#13;
earnings [equation (6)]. The ratio of females to the total migrant labor&#13;
population of each nationality has a significant negative coefficient,&#13;
suggesting that eemographic factor3 may be far more important in determining&#13;
the changes in the value of per capita remittances than financial variables.&#13;
The cross-section dummies indicate that there are significant differences&#13;
between the t'iree countries in the value of the intercept terms.&#13;
What the results do not show is that the relative interest rate&#13;
sehemes were successful in increasing officially recorded remittances. It&#13;
appears therefore that the foreign exchange deposit schemes have lead to&#13;
substitution of these accounts for domestic currency accounts without&#13;
inLreasing the total value of remittances. For example, in Yugoslavia, the&#13;
p;.portion of the financial resources of houeeholds held in local currency&#13;
deposits declined from about 46% ir. 1968 to 39% in 1973, while foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
exchange deposits of citizens, also as a percentage of total financial&#13;
resources of households, increased from 4.7 to 22.1%. Since foreign exchange&#13;
deposits can only held by emigrants and their families, it appears likely that&#13;
they were substituted for local currency deposits by migrant workers and their&#13;
families.'8'&#13;
The regressions do not show either that premium exchange rates&#13;
encourage official remittances or that black-market rates discourage them.&#13;
The latter result in particular appears con.trary to conventional wisdom.&#13;

Although holding of foreign ex In~ige depositsis legally restricted to&#13;
emigrants' families, recent experience in Yugoslavia indicates that others&#13;
are holding such deposits as well, thus reinforcing the substitution of&#13;
such deposits for local currency deposits.&#13;

IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
This chapter contains a summary of our results and relates our&#13;
findings to other work on the subject. The relevance of our results for&#13;
forecasting future remittance flows into labo.-exporting countries is&#13;
explored. We also raise the issues of what alternatives (if any) there are to&#13;
the migration of workers.&#13;
A.. Summary of Statistical Results&#13;
It is shown in Chapter I that remittance inflows are a major source&#13;
of foreign exchange earnings for many developing countries and that the rates&#13;
of growth in the nominal value of these flows, particularly into the countries&#13;
exporting labor to the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, have been high.&#13;
Chapter II shows that the level of economic activity in the host&#13;
country (and fluctuations in it) are important determinants of remittances.&#13;
The effects on remittanwes are not, however, uniform for all the labor&#13;
exporters. Different supply responses by different labor exporters to a given&#13;
increase in demj-v.d result in different rates of growth of nationalities in the&#13;
host country e.d hence in different rates of growth in remittance inflows,&#13;
even if the effect of wages is held constant.&#13;
In Chapter III, we show that, once the effect of the number of&#13;
workers and per capita earnings on remittances is controlled for, the&#13;
variables describing relative rates of return on-deposits and the incentive&#13;
schemes of labor-exporting countries to encourage remittances through official&#13;
channels do not have any effect on remittances. The overvaluation of currency&#13;
does not appear to have a negative impact on official remittances either. The&#13;
proxy variable for the age-sex maturity of the migrant population (the ratio&#13;
of females to total migrants) does turn out to be significant, as do the&#13;
cross-sectional dummy variables.&#13;
&#13;

B. Comparison with Other Work&#13;
There does not appear to be any published work on remittances with&#13;
which our results could be coGzared. Therefore, this section compares our&#13;
results with the "conventional wisdom" in the field. It is, of course,&#13;
generally acknowledged that foreign exchange remittances are a major benefit&#13;
to the emigrant country, but researchers have not attempted to document (or&#13;
assess the importance of) the determinants of such flows in a systematic&#13;
way.  In the meantime, many emigrant country governments have attempted to (a)&#13;
increase total remittances, (b) attract remittances through official channels,&#13;
and (c) encourage workers to put their savings into "productive investments"&#13;
rather than spend on luxury consumer goods, many of which may be imported.&#13;
Some of these schemes in fugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece were&#13;
discussed in Chapter III. Other countries, such as Sudan, India, Pakistan,&#13;
AlgeLia, and Morocco, have some mix of the incentives described in Chapter&#13;
III.  The government of the Philippines requires construction workers to send&#13;
back 30% of their wages,L9/ while in South Africa, a I rge part of the mine-&#13;
workers' earnings are given in the form of "deferred pay," and workers receive&#13;
these wages only when they return home.&#13;
The presumption has been that the incentive schemes work and do&#13;
encourage migrant workers not only to increase their total remittances, but&#13;
also to move them through official channels.  Our work does not support this&#13;
presumption. There is no evidence, for example, that the foreign exchange&#13;

succeed in substituting these foreign exchange deposits for local currency&#13;
deposits in the emigrant families' portfolio of financial assets (this&#13;
substitution would not show as an increase in remittances if foreign exchange&#13;
had been coverted to local currency officially and then placed in a local&#13;
currency deposit). The non-interest benefits associated with foreign currency&#13;
deposits probably encouraged such substitution.&#13;
Similarly, premium exchange rates do not appear to have had a&#13;
significant impact on official remittances into Turkey. On the other hand,&#13;
overvaluation does not seem to have discouraged these remittances, although it&#13;
is generally believed that "remittances are notably sensitive to any&#13;
indications of currency overvaluation and are prone to slow down in such&#13;
cases, leading to widespread resort to unofficial channels to transfer&#13;
funds."20/ The behavior of Turkish remittances appears to show that official-&#13;
incentives or disincentives are not as important as an environment of&#13;
confidence in the safety and liquidity of the assets held by migrants and in&#13;
the strength of the economy in general.&#13;
There is little evidence that governments of emigrant countries have&#13;
succeeded in channeling workers' earnings into productive investment through&#13;
official schemes.   As discussed in Chapter III, the total value of capital&#13;
invested in "workers' companies" in Turkey was $7.3 million in 1973, compared&#13;
with total remittances, of $1.2 billion in that year. In Yugoslavia,&#13;
small-scale companies which issued foreign currency bonds employed only 1,500&#13;
people in the same year. A more thorough investigation of the scale and&#13;
success of these schemes Is desirable; however, it seems unlikely that these&#13;
schemes have been an unqualified success.&#13;

Most studies have pointed out that the single largest investment&#13;
favored by emigrants is in urban real estate, agricultural land, and&#13;
housing. A survey conducted in the state of Kerala in South India shows that&#13;
in 1977 land and buildings accounted for 75% of the average value of assets of&#13;
an emigrant household, while no household reported investment in equities or&#13;
bonds.21/  Another survey, in Pakistan, showed that 66% of non-consumption&#13;
expenditures went into real estate (including agricultural land), while 4%&#13;
went into financial assets 221 A. G. Chandavarkar reports that in Turkey 56%&#13;
of migrants' savings went into land and housing.23/   In all these countries, a&#13;
large part of the remittances (58Z in Pakistan) went into the purchase of&#13;
consumer goods and debt repayment in the early years. It is not our intention&#13;
to make a thorough study of the investment preferences of emigrants and their&#13;
families, but merely to point out that, in the presence of such strong&#13;
preferences for real assets that will appreciate with inflation and that are&#13;
relatively risk free, investment schemes may not be particularly popular.&#13;
Another presumption in the literature is that per capita remittances&#13;
decline as the migrant stays longer and as his dependents in the host country&#13;
increase and in the home coL.utry decline. This hypothesis appears to be&#13;
confirmed by our analysis, although the ratio of females to total migrants&#13;
admittedly is an inadequate proxy for the complex transformation that takes&#13;
piace in the age-sex profile of the migrant community. Some of these changes&#13;
that occurred in Germany and France are tabulated below in Table 8.&#13;

It can be seen that, although there is not much change in the&#13;
proportion of the population over 45 years of age, the proportion below 25 years&#13;
of age has increased dramatically in Germany between 1968 and 1977, while the&#13;
proportion in the age agroup 25-45 has declined correspondingly. France shows&#13;
less dramatic changes since it has always had more liberal policies toward&#13;
migrant families. However, the ratio of newly entering dependents to newly&#13;
entering permanent workers rose to 2.3 in 1977 from 0.34 in 1965. Thus, there&#13;
were more than twice the number of family members as workers entering France in&#13;
1977 as in 1965.&#13;
The average length of stay of the migrant population has also&#13;
increased. In 1969, the proportion of the migrant population that had stayed in&#13;
Germany for over 7 years was 26% for males and 13% for females. In 1977, nearly&#13;
50% of the foreign population (males and females) had stayed in Germany for over&#13;
8 years, and more than half of these had beea there for over 10 years. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
Switzerlani; 56.5% of the active foreign population were termed "permanent" by&#13;
1977, that is, they had permission to stay indefinitely; in 1969, only 32.6% were&#13;
permanent or established workers.&#13;
It appears that the changing migrant-dependent profile and the extended&#13;
length of stay of migrants is adequately captured by the proportion of females in&#13;
the total migrant population. Our results show that the variable has a&#13;
significant effect on per -:apita remittances.&#13;
C.  Future Growth of Remittance Inflows to Labor-Exporting Countries&#13;
What are the implications of these results for the growth of&#13;
remittances? Since the number of workers is one of the most important&#13;
determinants of remittances, it is fruitful to discuss the determinants of demand&#13;
for migrant labor in the developed countries. In particular, it is important to&#13;
recognize some important shifts that have occurred in the structure of demand in&#13;
the last twenty years. These developments are summarized below.&#13;
Although international migration has been an important characteristic&#13;
of development of many countries and continents in the past, much of the&#13;
migration in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries can be termed&#13;
immigration, since it was characterized by a sense of permanency. While&#13;
immigration in this sense continues today, most countries now recruit their&#13;
immigrants; that is, they select immigrants according to some established (but&#13;
changeable) priorities with respect to skills and education.&#13;
A more recent phenomenon has been the recruitment of large numbers of&#13;
migrant workers on a temporary but systematic basis to satisfy a long-run excess&#13;
demand for labor and cyclical fluctuations in it. As Suzanne Paine puts it: "The&#13;
evolution of the system of temporarily recruited labor has meant that the host&#13;
countries have been both able to utilize an extremely flexible supply of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
labor.... and to select a substratum out of these to fill vacancies which are&#13;
expected to be permanent.'24/&#13;
Historically, the earliest example of such recruitment was in South&#13;
Africa, where the Chamber of Mines began to recruit migrant labor as early as&#13;
1896 to work in the gold and coal mines. These workers came mainly from&#13;
Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana, nd Swaziland. In Europe, beginning in the&#13;
1960's, large numbers of foreign workers were recruited by Germany, France,&#13;
Switzerland, Belgium, and other countries including the United Kingdom from the&#13;
neighboring, relatively poorer countries of Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Portugal,&#13;
Spain, and (until recently) Italy.   France, of course, has had a special&#13;
advantage in the recruiting of Algerians.&#13;
The most recent example of recruitment has been in the oil-rich&#13;
countries of the hiddle East. Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait, the United Arab&#13;
Emirates, Qatar, and Oman have large numbers of foreign workers from the&#13;
neighboring Arab states of Yemen, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Sudan and from India,&#13;
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Republic of Korea. The numbers of foreign workers&#13;
in these different regions are given in Table 9. It can be seen that, in 1975-&#13;
77, there were close to 214,000 migrant workers in South Africa, about 6 million&#13;
(including border and seasonal workers) in Europe, and ebout 1.6 million&#13;
(including about 139,000 Palestinians) in the oil-ricb Middle East countries.&#13;

Increasingly, it appears thaL countries facing an excess demand for&#13;
labor are buying "man-hours," preferring to pay for a rolling stock of&#13;
temporary labor whose demands on their social expenditures and whose&#13;
integration with the indigenous population are expected to be minimal.       What&#13;
are the long-term prospects for such migration? Can such recruitment be seen&#13;
as a permanent solution to situations of excess Cemand? Can the sending&#13;
countries plan for a constant or rising number of their workers earning abroad&#13;
and remitting foreign exchange?&#13;
The experience of Europe suggests that there is.a limit to the&#13;
number of foreign workers that a society will tolerate. France had the most&#13;
liberal policies toward migrant workers, allowing them to attain permanent&#13;
status after only 4 years of residence (as compared with 8 in Germany and 10&#13;
in Switzerland), "regularizing" workers who entered without permits,, and&#13;
allowing large numbers of dependents to enter. However, in 1968, France began&#13;
to move toward more restrictive laws. Germany introduced a series of measures&#13;
to discourage the use of migrant labor and in 1973 banned further&#13;
recruitment.   Switzerland attempted to "stabilize" its migrant labor force in&#13;
1971 and has progressively reduced its new recruitment.&#13;
Although these measures are attributed to the oil crisis and the&#13;
consequent depression, the timing of the beginning of these restrictions&#13;
suggests that they preceded the oil-price hike. The evidence presented here&#13;
also shows that there has been a "maturing" of the migrant population.&#13;
Despite original intentions to import only man-hours, even in the countries&#13;
with the strictest immigration laws, (a) migration had taken on a circulatory&#13;
character, as the same workers returned; (b) many migrant workers acquired (or&#13;
were eligiblc to acquire) permanancy status; and (c) the age-sex composition&#13;
of the migrant population began to parallel normal profiles, and greater&#13;
demands were being made on social services and infrastructure.&#13;
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
These developments, along with the not unexpected opposition to&#13;
immigrants from local power groups, led in the 1970's to policies of&#13;
"stabilization" which not only rescricted new entries but also attemptei to&#13;
(a) integrate foreign workers already in residence by speeding up family&#13;
reunions; (b) reduce the time required to acquire an unlimited work permit;&#13;
(c) increase family housing facilities; and (d) offer a financial grant to&#13;
those wcrkers who wished to leave permanently. These measures reflect the&#13;
host countries' desire to limit, stabilize, and integrate their foreign&#13;
populations.&#13;
Recent developments in the Middle East suggest that the countries&#13;
there are experiencing the same kinds of problems. A World Bank study of&#13;
labor migration in this region states that, in the Arab countries of&#13;
employment, the demographic evolution by which a migrant community composed&#13;
almost entirely of single males of working age gradually transforms into a&#13;
more normallv structured population (in terms of age and sex) has occurred&#13;
more quickly than commentators and planners had envisaged.2.5i Another study&#13;
estimates that in 1975, "for every migrant worker who moves to find employment&#13;
outside his home nation, one dependent also moves to take up residence in the&#13;
country of employment."26/  The problem is more acute in this region because&#13;
in none of the cou-tries in Europe (with the possible exception of Luxembourg)&#13;
was the proportion of foreigners in the labor force as large as it is in the&#13;
countries of the Middle East today. In 1975 in Saudi Arabia, migrant workers&#13;
accounted for nearly 34% of the labor force, in Libya 38%, and in Oman 54?;&#13;
25/ World Bank, "Final Report of Pesearch Project on Manpower and&#13;
International Labor Migration in the Middle East and North Africa,"&#13;
p. 132.&#13;
J. S. Birks and C. A. Sinclair, International Migration and Development in&#13;
the Arab Region, (Geneva: ILO, 1980),p. 33.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
the proportion was over 70% in the Gulf states of Kuwait, the United Arab&#13;
Emirates, and Qatar.&#13;
These developments lead one to believe that the prospects for&#13;
substantial increases in the demand for migrant workers in these regions are&#13;
dim.  The o-utlook for increasing the migrant labor stocks in the Middle East&#13;
in the short term (through 1985) may be slightly better than the outlook in&#13;
Europe for the same years, since the economies of the labor importers in this&#13;
region are crucially dependent on migrant labor27/ and since Saudi Arabia has&#13;
not yet reached the same relative levels of non-national population as have&#13;
Kuwait and the Gulf states.   In the longer term, however, the prospects do not&#13;
appear very bright in this region either; particularly if the nationality&#13;
composition of the work force evolves toward more Asian laborers. Therefore,&#13;
unless new poles of immigration develop, labor exporters are likely to find&#13;
that remittance inflows will not grow at the same rates as they did in the&#13;
past. Although some labor-exporting countries are no longer exporting as much&#13;
labor (for example, Italy and Algeria), and others may reduce their exports in&#13;
the future (Mexico), it is not clear that they will actually become large&#13;
importers of foreign labor.&#13;
Most labor exporters therefore are likely to find that remittances&#13;
will stabilize (in xaal terms) or grow at a rate slightly higher than the rate&#13;
of growth of per capita wages ;n the host country.   Equation (6) in Table 6&#13;
27/ The World Bank study projects that in the seven major labor importing&#13;
countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and U.A.E.)&#13;
non-national workers will reach 3.5 million in 1985, with the assumption&#13;
of high rates of growth (op.cit., Table 1.1). The projections also show&#13;
an increasing share of non-Arab states in this population (Table 1.2) and&#13;
large numbers of dependents, i.e., 10.9 million in 1985 (Table 4.25). The&#13;
study a_so projects a shift in the skill composition of workers toward&#13;
more skilled and professionally trained workers at the expense of the&#13;
unskilled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
gives an elasticity of 1.23 for per capita remittances with respect to per&#13;
capita earnings. Remittances may decline if the natural tendencies for&#13;
migrants to settle in the host country arc permitted and even encouraged, as&#13;
has happened in Europe. Then the elasticity of per capita remittances with&#13;
respect to per capita wages may in fact be lower [1.11, as computed from&#13;
equation (8), Table 6].&#13;
Given this rather modest prospect for future growth in the demand&#13;
for labor, it may be fruitful to ask whether there are alternatives to the&#13;
movement of people ft. work.  The benefits of migration, of course, go beyond&#13;
that of earning foreign exchange; the benefits of migration most impzrtantly&#13;
include the generation of employ.eizt and earnings .or large numbers of&#13;
people.  In a fundamental sense, therefore, it is important to ask whether&#13;
there are alternative ways of generating this employment and income.&#13;
Specifically, are direct foreign i:vestment and trade feasible substitutes for&#13;
labor movements?&#13;
This questioi is not studied here, and this section only points out&#13;
the issues that deserve careful study and analysis.  There is probably no&#13;
single answer to this question, in the sense that tnere .s no unique solution&#13;
to a system where all the factors of production are freely mobile. Most&#13;
traditional theory of trade assumes that factors of production are immobile&#13;
across national boundaries and that comparative advantage is reflected i;L&#13;
trade. If all factors are mobile and mo-e to the lo.zation of highest reward,&#13;
the system is indeterminate ultimately, and the fixing factors are those of&#13;
historical incident and of natural locational advantage."28/&#13;

Evaluation and Plolicies," Boston University, March 1979 (mimeo).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Empirically, of cc'trse, the existence of trade, inve-tment capital&#13;
movements, and labor migration suggests that there are constraints -&#13;
institutional or structural - on the free flow of at least one of these&#13;
factors in any given situation. A study of the nature of these constraints&#13;
and their consequence3 for the migracion of capital and labor would be&#13;
rewarding.&#13;
To the extent that capit;tl movements and trade have occurred, there&#13;
is little eviden.e that labor-receiving countries actively encouraged trade&#13;
with labor exporters or that private direct investment was directed toward&#13;
labor-supplying countries. Nor is it clear that such bilateral flows are&#13;
desirable or efficient globally. Studying the interrelationships between&#13;
flows of capital, labor, and trade clearly is of great interest and irLdeed may&#13;
be necessary to understanding and forecasting labor movements.&#13;

a/ As explained in the text, these data were added to workers' remittance inflows as reported in the&#13;
current balance of payments.&#13;
b/  As explained in the text, the variable takes values equal to zero for the years during which the&#13;
scheme was not exis:ent.&#13;
cl Remittances were exchanged either at the par rate or a premium rate. In addition, if the currency&#13;
was deposited in a commercial tank, a certain proportion of the deposit was added to the deposit.&#13;

APPENDIX B:&#13;
STATISTICAL PROCEDURES --&#13;
FORMULAS FOR CALCULATING TREND GROWTH RATES AND ELASTICITIES&#13;
1. Trend Growth Rates of Remittance.. (Nominal Value)&#13;
The following regression of time on remittances (credit or debit)&#13;
was estimated:&#13;
R = a + aiT ...............                                (1),&#13;
where&#13;
R  - Remittances (credit or debit)&#13;
T  = 1, 2, 3 .....n.&#13;
The coefficient a, estimates the average onnual increase in&#13;
remittances per year. The average percentage inc.ease per year is given by&#13;
the formula:&#13;
AR        a1&#13;
where&#13;
the bar denotes average values.&#13;
2. Elasticity of Remittances with Respect to Trend GDP in the Labor-Receiving&#13;
Country&#13;
The formula for estimating this elasticity is:&#13;
GDPT&#13;
n GDPT  b&#13;
where the bar denotes average values, and&#13;
bi = the coefficient from the equation R     bo + b1 GDPT + b2 GDPDEV.... (2)&#13;
GDPT = trend value of nominal GDP in the labor-receiving country&#13;
GDPDEV  = the devi.aion of actual GDP from the trend value, expressed as&#13;
a ratio to trend value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
Note that the trend value of GDP, that is, GDPT, is predicted by the&#13;
equation:&#13;
GDP = CO + Cl T ..............                       (3).&#13;
3. The Effect on Remittances of a 1% Deviation in GDP from Trend Value&#13;
The coefficient h2 in equation (2) gives the effect on remittances&#13;
of a unit deviation of GDP from its trend value. The effect of a 1% deviation&#13;
is obtained by multiplyirg thc coefficient b2 by 0.01. The elasticity of&#13;
remittances with respect to a 1% deviation can then be estimated as:.&#13;
b  * .01&#13;
n DEV =   _&#13;
R&#13;

            International migrant workers'
            remittances : issues and prospects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The study puts together available data
            on workers' remittances to developing countries and
            analyzes the regional structure of and growth in these
            flows. It is shown that these flows are substantial. For
            many labor exporters, they are a major source of foreign
            exchange earnings. Remittances have grown at high rates,
            particularly in those countries that have exported labor to
            the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries. The paper relates the
            flow of remittances to the level of and fluctuations in
            economic activity and to inflation in the host countries;
            the results of the empirical analysis show that these latter
            variables explain a large part of the variation in
            remittance flows. For a subsample of three countries, the
            study attempts to assess, through regression analysis, the
            effects of relative rates of return on savings, of incentive
            schemes in the home countries, and of demographic factors on
            the flow of remittances.
