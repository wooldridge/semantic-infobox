TECHNICAL ANNEX FOR A&#13;
PROPOSED EMERGENCY RECOVERY CREDIT&#13;
TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
A. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE KOSOVO CONFLICT&#13;
1. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo' is inflicting a severe strain on internal stability&#13;
and economic management in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR&#13;
Macedonia).  Trade with and through the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR&#13;
Yugoslavia) has been cut off. Moreover, the country has been forced to absorb a large&#13;
and ongoing movement of refugees from neighboring Kosovo into northern FYR&#13;
Macedonia. In addition to the extreme challenge created for humanitarian efforts, these&#13;
recent events have severely undercut economic activity in FYR Macedonia and begun to&#13;
threaten the country's macroeconomic stability.&#13;
2.    The UNHCR estimates that nearly 600,000 people have fled Kosovo since March&#13;
1998, of which 155,000 registered refugees remain in FYR Macedonia as of April 28,&#13;
1999 (with an additional 24,000 evacuated to third countries). This is about 7 percent of&#13;
FYR Macedonia's population. About 60,000 of these refugees are in camps in FYR&#13;
Macedonia, but the rest have been taken in by families. In particular, the pressures of fast&#13;
accelerating refugee arrivals since the last week of March have sorely tested the&#13;
Government's, NGOs', and official organization's logistical capabilities. Refugees&#13;
equivalent to 6 percent of the population have now arrived in FYR Macedonia with&#13;
uncertain near-term prospects for return, raising the specter of domestic political unrest&#13;
and threatening to unravel the substantial progress made towards the establishment of a&#13;
multi-cultural democratic state.&#13;
3.    The de facto cessation of all economic relations with and through FR Yugoslavia&#13;
has dealt a severe blow to an already ailing economy (see Table 1). Registered&#13;
unemployment was already at around one-third of the workforce last year, with a&#13;
majority long-term unemployed. Trade with FR Yugoslavia has been deteriorating for&#13;
more than a year, because of trade barriers erected by FR Yugoslavia and the fighting in&#13;
Kosovo (a major market for Macedonian agricultural produce). First quarter exports&#13;
were only half the level of a year earlier. Yet FYR Macedonia has been only partially&#13;
successful at diversification of markets, suppliers, and transit routes, a task made difficult&#13;
by the trade embargoes imposed in recent years; FYR Macedonia's landlocked and&#13;
relatively isolated geographical position, with limited transport links except through FR&#13;
Yugoslavia; and little foreign direct investment which might have fostered new trading&#13;
relationships. Thus, its economy has remained vulnerable to any sudden shift in relations&#13;
with FR Yugoslavia. To some extent, limited diversification of trade and a low level of&#13;
foreign investment have been a by-product of the slow pace of structural reform.&#13;
Kosovo is a region within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which comprises the republics of&#13;
Serbia and Montenegro. FR Yugoslavia if not a member of the World Bank or the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Nevertheless, even if the reform program had been on-track, the ongoing conflict in&#13;
Kosovo would have dealt the economy a severe blow.&#13;
4.    The Government, in its initial assessment of economic damages, has not been able&#13;
to quantify the likelihood of enterprises' finding alternative suppliers and markets. The&#13;
Government has only just begun to assess the losses to the economy as a result of trade&#13;
disruption and has yet to consider carefully how recovery may occur. Because the crisis&#13;
is still underway and its resolution uncertain, it is premature to present any but&#13;
preliminary estimates. In collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the&#13;
European Union, the World Bank is working closely with Government to further refine&#13;
these estimates to understand more fully the social and economic impact of the crisis.&#13;
According to the Government, there have been several concrete illustrations of how the&#13;
crisis will cause damages. For example, about $50 million worth of unpaid industrial&#13;
goods intended for export are currently in transit in FR Yugoslavia. About $20 million of&#13;
early fruits and vegetable, intended for shipment to FR Yugoslavia for processing, had to&#13;
be dumped on the domestic market; and tobacco and cigarette sales to FR Yugoslavia,&#13;
expected at around $45 million this year, will have to be redirected but the glut of these&#13;
products on world markets likely limits profitable sale elsewhere. At the same time,&#13;
many next-door suppliers of specialized inputs for FYR Macedonia's industrial sector,&#13;
often willing to engage in barter arrangements, will be difficult and expensive to replace.&#13;
5.    Moreover, many trading relations with the rest of the world have deteriorated as&#13;
quickly as relations with FR Yugoslavia: the textile sector, newly expanded through&#13;
consignment contracts with European companies, has seen most of its contracts cancelled&#13;
because of concern over timely delivery, and both banks and enterprises have seen credit&#13;
lines with European banks rescinded, making export financing difficult. Substitution of&#13;
alternative markets and transit routes will be difficult and will take time. Based on&#13;
surveys of firms in various economic sectors, the Government has concluded that&#13;
transport costs for traded goods are likely to rise by 20-30 percent on average this year.&#13;
For some traditional exports, alternative transport is difficult to envision, e.g., steel&#13;
usually sent by train to Europe, or perishable fruits and vegetables trucked to neighboring&#13;
FR Yugoslavia for processing. The replacement of damaged infrastructure along the&#13;
traditional transport route to Europe through FR Yugoslavia will likely take years; and&#13;
the alternative routes all suffer from poor infrastructure, limited capacity, and greatly&#13;
increased utilization.&#13;
B. IDA'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
IDA/IBRD's Overall Response&#13;
6.   IDA/IBRD's response to the Kosovo crisis' impact on FYR Macedonia is closely&#13;
coordinated with the IMF. Together, the two institutions are coordinating the financial&#13;
response of the international community to the Kosovo crisis. On April 2, 1999, the&#13;
World Bank sponsored an emergency Informal Donors' Meeting on the Kosovo crisis;&#13;
international financial institutions and bilateral participants, including representatives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
from the affected countries, ex-changed views about the immediate impact of the crisis on&#13;
the countries in the region and shared information about ongoing and planned donor&#13;
support programs. A follow-up coordination meeting for the relevant international&#13;
financial institutions was held in London on April 18. IMF and Bank staff produced a&#13;
joint paper containing a preliminary assessment of the external financing needs arising&#13;
from the Kosovo crisis  This paper was discussed at the IMF and World Bank boards,&#13;
which endorsed the broad approach outlined in the paper. The paper was subsequently&#13;
discussed in the meeting on the Kosovo crisis on April 27, 1999 during the Spring&#13;
meetings.&#13;
7.   Given FYR Macedonia's turbulent neighborhood, the CAS approved in July 1998&#13;
anticipated the possibility of an emergency scenario arising from growing tensions in&#13;
Kosovo (para. 41). This scenario predicted that despite the Government's best efforts, the&#13;
environment for efficient long-term investment would likely be undermined, while short&#13;
term import requirements would rise. While the Bank would expect and press for other&#13;
donors to increase their assistance under these circumstances, the Bank would seek an&#13;
exceptional IDA allocation to provide support for critical imports and a reorientation of&#13;
social programs to meet emergency needs. The CAS-specified triggers for moving into&#13;
this emergency scenario are now overwhelmingly met: the inflow of refugees may soon&#13;
approach ten times the level considered burdensome in the CAS; large-scale military&#13;
mobilization with impacts on the budget and climate for foreign investment is underway;&#13;
and FYR Macedonia's export channels through FR Yugoslavia are seriously impeded.&#13;
With the IMF also responding to the needs of the Government for timely economic aid,&#13;
bilateral donors and other multilateral agencies already pledging humanitarian and&#13;
economic aid, and an emergency consultative group meeting planned for May 5, 1999,&#13;
the international community as a whole is already stepping forward to assist FYR&#13;
Macedonia. This operation is, therefore one component of this international response.&#13;
8.   In line with the approach outlined in the joint World Bank/IMF paper, IDA is&#13;
following a multi-pronged strategy to help FYR Macedonia to cope with this crisis. It&#13;
consists of:&#13;
(a)   Immediate assistance through financing of critical imports provided under&#13;
the proposed Emergency Recovery Credit. An emergency recovery&#13;
operation is considered appropriate in the case of FYR Macedonia,&#13;
because of the exceptionally large impact of the crisis on the balance-of-&#13;
payments, especially the current account.&#13;
(b)   Ongoing balance of payments and budget assistance by continuing&#13;
preparation of the FESAL with suitable redesign and adjustments as&#13;
needed in the changed situation. A Labor Redeployment and Social Fund&#13;
is currently under preparation to help mitigate the social costs arising from&#13;
the Kosovo conflict and to help with the costs associated with the&#13;

Needs and the Role of the Fund and the World Bank in the International Response. Prepared jointly&#13;
by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, April 15, 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4&#13;
structural reform program to be supported by the FESAL (proposed Board&#13;
date: January 2000).&#13;
(c)   Reallocation of uncommitted funds of selected ongoing IDA operations to&#13;
redirect project activities to areas and infrastructure needs most affected&#13;
by the economic crisis and the refugees. IDA staff are working with&#13;
counterpart Government agencies and other development partners to&#13;
consider how existing IDA operations might provide for the urgent social&#13;
and infrastructure needs arising from the current crisis. The IDA team has&#13;
proposed to the Ministry of Health that some proceeds be reallocated&#13;
within the ongoing Health Sector Transition Project for the quick&#13;
procurement of selected pharmaceuticals and medical consumables from&#13;
UNICEF. Moreover, the team is also considering an infusion of&#13;
additional IDA resources to the Social Reform and Technical Assistance&#13;
project in order to assist newly laid off workers re-enter the labor force.&#13;
(d)   Special support to refugees provided from the post-conflict fund. A&#13;
proposal for funding from the Bank's Post Conflict Fund for a US$1&#13;
million grant in support of the refugees was approved on April 27 by the&#13;
Post Conflict Fund Board. This grant would be implemented under an&#13;
umbrella arrangement with UNICEF, and it would focus on supporting&#13;
institutions which provide essential services to the refugees, especially&#13;
children. Participation in direct assistance to refugees is essential in order&#13;
to provide the link between humanitarian and development assistance,&#13;
which can effectively be performed by IDA (in coordination with other&#13;
bilateral and international donors), through ongoing investment&#13;
operations.&#13;
(e)   Policy advice on recovery and a return to growth and reform. IDA/IBRD&#13;
stands ready to assist with policy advice and adjustment and investment&#13;
operations to support the Government's plan to accelerate delayed&#13;
structural reforms.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
9.    The proposed Emergency Recovery Project, following OP/BP 8.50 on Emergency&#13;
Recovery Assistance, would assist the Government in maintaining macroeconomic&#13;
stability while helping to make up for export receipt shortfalls and reduced access to&#13;
foreign borrowing and direct investment, allowing imports critical to a resumption of&#13;
growth. The Credit is designed to help maintain macroeconomic stability despite serious&#13;
external shocks, depressed growth, rising balance of payments pressures, and exceptional&#13;
demands on public expenditures during a time of reduced possibilities for revenue&#13;
collection.&#13;
10. While this type of operation does not include conditionality linked to&#13;
macroeconomic policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of economic developments and close&#13;
collaboration with the IMF will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence&#13;
on the part of the Government. The proposed IMF standby arrangement would also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
support Government efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability during this difficult&#13;
period. The IDA Credit, of $50 million equivalent and 100 percent quick disbursing,&#13;
based on the Government's request and an assessment of financing requirements for the&#13;
balance of payments for 1999, will provide immediate support to finance a positive list of&#13;
imports needed to cope with the emergency while supporting macroeconomic objectives.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
11.   The Emergency Recovery Project will provide immediate, quick- disbursing&#13;
support to finance a positive list of imports needed for the recovery effort while&#13;
supporting macroeconomic objectives (see Schedule A). While the proposed credit&#13;
would be entirely quick- disbursing, it is only the first part of a recovery strategy for FYR&#13;
Macedonia which is under discussion now by the Bank Group and the Government to&#13;
respond to the effects of the Kosovo crisis. The project will provide assistance for a&#13;
broad range of imports by the private sector, especially irnported production inputs and&#13;
imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury&#13;
goods, military equipment, or nuclear reactors.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
12.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance with close&#13;
collaboration with the National Bank. The Ministry of Finance will open a US dollar&#13;
Special Account in the National Bank for the Credit, which would finance 100 percent of&#13;
the foreign exchange costs of private sector imports on the positive list agreed with the&#13;
Government. This list is based on major items imported by the private sector in the last&#13;
two years.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
13.   Consistent with the emergency nature of this recovery assistance, implementation&#13;
arrangements have been simplified. To ensure due diligence and sound governance, the&#13;
arrangements would seek to ensure:&#13;
(a) that the Credit proceeds are used only to finance imports of items contained&#13;
in the list of imports permissible under the Credit (Attachment 1);&#13;
(b) proper procedures on procurement and accounting and the complete&#13;
documentation of transactions; and&#13;
(c) provision of management information using suitable monitoring and audit&#13;
tools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
14.   The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will sign an Implementation&#13;
Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, defining the assistance to be provided by each entity.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance will:&#13;
(a) authorize the National Bank to administer and execute the Project;&#13;
(b) approve quarterly financial management and progress reports;&#13;
(c) undertake necessary actions to ensure the State Auditing Bureau carry out the&#13;
project audit on quarterly basis; and&#13;
(d) appoint independent private auditors to carry out the final audit at completion&#13;
of the project.&#13;
The National Bank will:&#13;
(e) manage and operate the Special Account, including preparing withdrawal&#13;
applications;&#13;
(f) manage project accounts using appropriate financial management systems&#13;
and provide accountable and timely financial information on project&#13;
financing and expenditures;&#13;
(g) prepare and submit quarterly financial management reports and progress&#13;
reports to the Ministry of Finance for approval and submission to IDA;&#13;
(h) maintain documentation in connection with eligible imports and make&#13;
documentation available to independent auditors; and&#13;
(i) facilitate independent audit activities.&#13;
More detailed instructions on accounting, financial management, and auditing will be&#13;
provided by World Bank staff during project implementation.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
15.   The Credit proceeds would finance private sector imports against documentation&#13;
evidencing that the imported goods were on the positive list of imports listed in&#13;
Attachmnent 1. Credit proceeds would be limited to goods from eligible countries under&#13;
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and&#13;
January 1999) and are also participating countries under current IDA Guidelines. No&#13;
more than 50 percent of the Credit would be used in the aggregate for the import of any&#13;
single item on the positive list of imports. To avoid high overhead transaction costs for&#13;
IDA, financing would be restricted to contracts $20,000 or above.&#13;
16.  I]n addition to the foregoing, the Credit would only finance imports procured by&#13;
the private sector in accordance with procedures presented in table below. Prior review&#13;
thresholds (which require procurement documentation to be submitted to the Bank ex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
ante) will be set at the same level as the procurement thresholds (which determine the&#13;
method of procurement).&#13;
Table 1. Summary of Procurement Procedures for Items on the Positive List&#13;
Procurement Category                      Procurement Method&#13;
Through established commodity markets, or&#13;
Commodities, for private sector contracts  other channels of competitive procurement as&#13;
valued at or more than $5 million.        defined in Clause 2.65 of IDA's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
Commodities, for private sector contracts&#13;
valued at or more than $5 million.        Based on established commercial practices.&#13;
Goods for private sector contracts valued at or   Simplified ICB procedures under Clauses 2.63&#13;
more than $3 million.                     and 2.64 of IDA's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Goods for private sector contracts valued at  Based on established commercial practices.&#13;
less than $3 million.&#13;
Note: Imports valued at less than $20,000 would not be eligible for financing&#13;
17.   There is no Country Procurement Assessment report currently available for the&#13;
country. However, the private sector is free to import almost any material into the&#13;
country, and goods imports last year exceeded $1.7 billion. Commercial practices of&#13;
private sector firms are based on open competition and are generally consistent with a&#13;
competitive market place. Typically, firms obtain multiple quotations from traditional&#13;
suppliers of the items and base their purchase decisions on the principle of best value for&#13;
money. Oil imports by the biggest importer in FYR Macedonia are based on the spot oil&#13;
price in the world market. Because of this judgment that private sector importing is&#13;
generally profit-oriented and therefore efficient, IDA/IBRD have determined that current&#13;
commercial practices would be acceptable without any additional stipulation; and the&#13;
thresholds for IDA/1BRD prior review are based on typical contracts of medium and&#13;
large companies, which were generally more than US$3 million while oil import&#13;
contracts were generally more than $5 million.&#13;
18.   The National Bank, which in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance is the&#13;
executing agency for the proposed Project, has prior experience in coordination of&#13;
disbursements against imports and is capable of ensuring compliance with the agreed&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
19.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the&#13;
delivered cost of imports by the private sector, excluding import duties and taxes, subject&#13;
to the agreed positive list. Disbursements in respect of expenditures under contracts for&#13;
goods for the private sector costing less than $3 million equivalent and for commonly&#13;
traded commodities would be made against Statements of Expenditures, for which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
supportt g- documentation would be retamaed by the National Bank and made available&#13;
for rev&gt;.-'v by IDA financial mnanagemernt and procurement specialists and project&#13;
auditots. The project would be implemented over a one-year period and is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2000. The Closing Date for this credit would be December 31,&#13;
2000.&#13;
20.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 7.4 million,&#13;
20 percent of the credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred up to&#13;
four months before loan signing, given the deterioration of economic relations with FR&#13;
Yugoslavia since the beginning of 1999, followed by collapse in mid-March.&#13;
21.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar&#13;
Special Account to be established in the National Bank of FYR Macedonia, with an&#13;
initial authorized allocation of $20 million (SDR 14.8 million equivalent), 50 percent of&#13;
the credit amount net of retroactive financing.  The Special Account would be&#13;
replenished as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of funds to cover eligible&#13;
imports.&#13;
Financial Management and Monitoring&#13;
22.   Project Accounting. The National Bank has in place adequate accounting and&#13;
financial management reporting systems. Separate project accounts to record all project&#13;
expenditures per agreed 'positive list' and financial reporting format will be maintained.&#13;
The chart of accounts will provide consistency in the classification of financial and&#13;
accounting transactions. Accounting and administrative internal controls for the project&#13;
are in place and will be strengthened by the quarterly audits to be carried out by the State&#13;
Auditing Bureau. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance have qualified staff&#13;
experienced in managing World Bank projects. (See Attachment 3).&#13;
23.   Accounting and Auditing Standards. The accounting and auditing standards in&#13;
FYR Macedonia are based on the Macedonian Law on Accountancy. The Law was&#13;
amended on July 10, 1998 (Official Gazette of RM No. 42/93, 48/93 &amp; 6/95). Where&#13;
national standards are used, the Bank requires financial statements to disclose any&#13;
material departures from International Accounting Standards and the impact of such&#13;
departures on the financial statements. The national standards will be in compliance with&#13;
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISA),&#13;
effective January 1, 2000. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance use accrual&#13;
accounting basis.&#13;
24.   Financial Reporting. The Ministry of Finance will be required to submit to IDA&#13;
within 45 days after end of each calendar quarter:&#13;
(a) a project financial management report;&#13;
(b) a progress report; and&#13;
(c) an audit report, including audit of the Special Account and Statements of&#13;
Expenditure by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
25.   Audit Arrangements. The Ministry of Finance will select independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA before the commencement of project activities. Because of the urgent&#13;
nature of the project and the limited time to set up project-specific internal control&#13;
systems and procedures, it has been agreed to have quarterly audits carried out by the&#13;
State Auditing Bureau, a member of the International Organization of Supreme Auditing&#13;
Institution (INTOSAI). These audits are intended to assess compliance with the Project&#13;
legal requirements. It has also been agreed that an international audit firm acceptable to&#13;
IDA will carry out a full financial audit upon completion of the Project. The terms of&#13;
reference for the audit, to be submitted to IDA for approval, will indicate that the project&#13;
accounts be maintained on an accrual basis and will include the following tasks:&#13;
(a) assessment of adequacy and reliability of procedures used to prepare customs&#13;
certificates or similar certificates;&#13;
(b) examination of customs certificates on which the World Bank disbursements&#13;
have been made;&#13;
(c) assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to&#13;
monitor expenditures and other financial transactions; and&#13;
(d) verification that expenditures submitted to IDA, including those submitted in&#13;
the project financial management reports are eligible for IDA financing, and&#13;
identification of any ineligible expenditures.&#13;
Donor Coordination&#13;
26.   An emergency Consultative Group Meeting for the FYR Macedonia convened by&#13;
the World Bank and the EU will take place on May 5, 1999, in Paris. In preparation for&#13;
this meeting, the Bank and the IMF undertook an evaluation of the damage caused by the&#13;
Kosovo crisis in the region. The assessment for FYR Macedonia draws heavily on IDA's&#13;
preliminary work with the Government during appraisal of this Credit and preparation for&#13;
the upcoming Consultative Group meeting. Humanitarian assistance to the refugees has&#13;
been forthcoming, and the Government has received some funds from UNHCR and&#13;
should soon begin to receive EU funds for reimbursement of direct expenditures on&#13;
refugees.&#13;
E. ACTION PLAN&#13;
27.   During negotiations, the Government delegation and Association representatives&#13;
reached speedy agreement on the remaining details of finanLcial management, reports, and&#13;
auditing, of procurement thresholds, and disbursement procedures to be followed. A set&#13;
of performance monitoring indicators was agreed, selected to allow the Association to&#13;
track the impact of the project through the behavior of overall macroeconomic conditions&#13;
without being unduly burdensome to the Government.&#13;

Monitoring Indicators&#13;
The objective of the Emergency Recovery Project is to assist the Former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia to finance critical private secto:r imports while maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability. The following preliminary indicators would be used to monitor&#13;
macroeconomic stability:&#13;
Gross reserves of the National Bank of FYR Macedonia not to fall below two months of&#13;
imports of goods (excluding those financed by official grants); and&#13;
The overall fiscal deficit of the Central Government expected not to exceed 5 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1999.&#13;
These indicators would be adjusted accordingly, as macroeconomic estimates and&#13;
projections are refined, as reflected in the subsequent Government economic program.&#13;

Financial Management Assessment&#13;
Objectives and Project Description&#13;
1.  Objective of Financial Management Assessment. The objective of the financial&#13;
management assessment was to determine whether the project has in place adequate&#13;
financial management systems, including acceptable financial management and&#13;
accounting controls as required by the Bank in OP/BP 10.02.&#13;
2.   Project Objectives and Project Description.    The proposed Emergency&#13;
Recovery Project will assist the Government of FYR Macedonia in maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability through financing critical imports needed to cope with the&#13;
Kosovo crisis.&#13;
Sources and Flow of Funds&#13;
3.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$50.0 million equivalent will finance 100 percent&#13;
of the delivered cost of general imports by the private sector, excluding import duties and&#13;
taxes, and subject to an agreed 'positive list'. The IDA Credit will be channeled through a&#13;
Special Account for the project to be opened in the National Bank of Macedonia (the&#13;
Central Bank). The National Bank, as a representative of the Ministry of Finance, will&#13;
operate the Special Account.  It will be responsible for submitting withdrawal&#13;
applications for advance payment and replenishments of the Special Account to cover the&#13;
IDA Credit share of eligible imports. Upon receipt of written transfer payments orders&#13;
from the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank will transfer the IDA funds to the&#13;
Ministry budget through the Bureau of Payments (ZPP). The Ministry of Finance will&#13;
provide the National Bank with names of authorized signatories with authority to sign&#13;
withdrawal applications.&#13;
4.   Statements of Expenditure (SOE).  Under the SOE withdrawal procedure, the&#13;
National Bank will forward to IDA an application for reimbursement of payments already&#13;
made and eligible for IDA financing. Relevant supporting documents including customs&#13;
certificates, and evidence of payment will be retained by the National Bank and made&#13;
available for inspection by IDA representatives and the external auditors.&#13;
5.   Retroactive financing. Payments made after the emergency occurred and within&#13;
four months prior to the expected date of loan signing are permissible for payments; to a&#13;
cumulative maximum of 20 percent of the credit artount.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
6.  The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance in close collaboration&#13;
with the National Bank. Both the Ministry and the National Bank will sign an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
'Implementation Agreement'. The parties' obligations under the Implementation&#13;
Agreement will be as follows:&#13;
(a) the Ministry of Finance will:&#13;
(i)  authorize the National Bank to administer and execute the Project;&#13;
(ii)  approve quarterly financial management reports and progress reports&#13;
on monitoring indicators prepared by the National Bank;&#13;
(iii) undertake the necessary actions to ensure that the State Auditing&#13;
Bureau carry out project audits on a quarterly basis; the audit report,&#13;
including certified project financial statements in agreed format,&#13;
accounts for the Special Account and vvithdrawals made on basis of&#13;
Statement of Expenditure, is submitted to IDA within 45 days after end&#13;
of each quarter; and&#13;
(iv) appoint independent private auditors satisfactory to IDA to carry out&#13;
the project final audit. The final audit will cover total, cumulative,&#13;
disbursement and expenditures for the Project, and report submitted to&#13;
IDA no later than three months after the completion of the Project.&#13;
(b) National Bank, Department of Foreign Relations&#13;
(i)  prepare disbursement requests including replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account;&#13;
(ii)  maintain records and accounts for the Special Account;&#13;
(iii) maintain documentation in connection with eligible imports and make&#13;
documentation available to independent auditors and IDA&#13;
representatives (the National Bank receives monthly reports and copies&#13;
of customs certificates from the five customs offices which are under&#13;
the Ministry of Finance);&#13;
(iv) prepare quarterly financial management reports (PMRs) and progress&#13;
reports of monitoring indicators, and submit to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
for submission to IDA; and&#13;
(v)  facilitate independent audit activities.&#13;
(c)  Ministry of Finance and National Bank of Macedonia&#13;
(i)  Ministry of Finance to approve quarterly financial management reports&#13;
and progress reports, prepared by the National Bank, and submit&#13;
audited reports, to IDA within 45 days after end of each quarter; and&#13;
(ii)  Ministry of Finance and National Bank jointly to prepare and submit to&#13;
IDA, the Implementation Completion Report for the Project after&#13;
completion of the Project.&#13;
Financial Management and Reporting&#13;
7.   The National Bank has in place adequate accounting and financial management&#13;
reporting systems for the Project. The chart of accountis provides consistency in the&#13;
classification of financial and accounting transactions. Accounting and administrative&#13;
internal controls are in place. The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance have&#13;
qualified staff experienced in managing World Bank projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
8.   Quarterly financial management reports, progress reports and audits of project&#13;
accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA, will be provided to the Ministry of Finance for submission to IDA&#13;
within 45 days after end of each calendar quarter. The quarterly reports contained in the&#13;
system and to be agreed during negotiations are as follows (formats in the Project File):&#13;
(a)  Project Financial Management Report (Project Financial Statements)&#13;
Sources and Uses of Funds (Report 1 -A)&#13;
Special Account Statement (Report 1-E)&#13;
(b)  Progress Report&#13;
Summary of Project Progress (Report 2)&#13;
The transitional reporting requirements do not include a procurement management report&#13;
because procurement will be done by the private sector based on imports from a 'positive&#13;
list' and any contracts above US$3.0 million for goods and US$5.0 million for&#13;
commodities will follow simplified procurement procedures.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing Standards&#13;
9.   Accounting and auditing standards in Macedonia are based on Macedonian Law on&#13;
Accountancy. The Law was amended on July 10, 1998 (Official Gazette of RM No.&#13;
42/93, 48/93 &amp; 6/95). Where national standards are used, the Bank requires financial&#13;
statements to disclose any material departures from International Accounting Standards,&#13;
and the impact of such departures on the financial statements. The national standards&#13;
will be in compliance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International&#13;
Standards on Auditing (ISA), effective January 1, 2000. The National Bank and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance use accrual accounting basis.&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
10. The Ministry of Finance will select independent auditors acceptable to IDA before&#13;
the commencement of project activities. Because of the urgent nature of the project and&#13;
the limited time to set up project-specific internal control systems and procedures, it has&#13;
been agreed to have quarterly audits carried out by the State Auditing Bureau, a member&#13;
of International Organization of Supreme Auditing Institution (INTOSAI). These audits&#13;
are intended to assess compliance with the Project's legal requirements. It has also been&#13;
agreed that an international audit firm acceptable to IDA will carry out a full financial&#13;
audit upon completion of the Project. The terms of reference (TOR) for the audit, to be&#13;
submitted to IDA for approval, will indicate that the projects accounts be maintained on&#13;
an accrual basis and will include the following tasks:&#13;
(a) assessment of adequacy and reliability of procedures used to prepare customs&#13;
certificates or similar certificates;&#13;
(b) examination of customs certificates on which IDA disbursements have been&#13;
used;&#13;
(c) assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to&#13;
monitor expenditures and other financial transactions; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(d)  verification that expenditures submitted to IDA, including those submitted in&#13;
the project management reports are eligible for IDA financing, and&#13;
identification of any ineligible expenditures.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
11. Review of financial management systems, including internal controls, quality of&#13;
staff, accounting standards and financial reporting capacity of the National Bank's&#13;
Department of International Foreign Relations determined that the project has satisfied&#13;
the Bank's financial management requirements as required under OP/BP 10.02. Loan&#13;
disbursements will be based on traditional disbursement procedures and not PMR-based&#13;
disbursements. This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Bank and&#13;
the Borrower.&#13;

            Macedonia - Emergency Recovery Credit Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Recovery Credit Project
            aims to assist the country to maintain macroeconomic
            stability despite severe trade disruption and large inflows
            of refugees from Kosovo through financing of imports and
            government budget support. The project will provide
            immediate, quick-disbursing support to finance a positive
            list of imports needed for the recovery effort while
            supporting macroeconomic objectives. Also, the project will
            provide assistance for a broad range of imports by the
            private sector, especially imported production inputs and
            imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to
            cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, or nuclear
            reactors. The main benefit of the project is to provide
            financing for necessary imports despite a sharp drop in
            exports and a decline in private capital inflows and to
            allow for necessary budgetary expenditures related to
            refugees not covered by humanitarian relief agencies and
            related to the sharp economic downturn induced by the
            crisis. The major project risks are that the Kosovo conflict
            may continue, imposing ongoing debilitating effects on the
            region and requiring additional interventions by the
            international donor community.
