              of the 292nd Regular and the 142nd and 143rd Special&#13;
&#13;

                   we will next take up the proposed loan to theTata&#13;

              Iron and Steel.&#13;
&#13;
                   I'd like to first call on Mr. Goodman.&#13;
                   MR. GOODMAN:    Mr. Chairman, sir, I should like to begin&#13;
&#13;
              by summarizing the financial requirements of the Tata&#13;
         J&#13;
        iii   Company 1 s current expansion and modernization program.&#13;

        1,&#13;
        i:&#13;
        !I first Bank loan, was made that the amount of funds required&#13;

        1,&#13;
        I:&#13;
              would be of the order of $250 million or their equivalent.&#13;
        ii&#13;
        'i&#13;
        H&#13;
        ,, This estimate has remained firm, virtually firm, since that&#13;
        Ii&#13;

        !i time.&#13;
          i&#13;
        It         Of this sum, approximately a half, nearly a half, was&#13;
         ii&#13;

         11   to be raised by the company from its own earnings and an&#13;
         11&#13;
         1i&#13;
         11&#13;
              issue of new shares amounting to about $28 million.     The&#13;
&#13;
              first Bank loan, which was an amount in various currencies&#13;
&#13;
              equivalent to $75 million, was to cover the bulk of the main&#13;
&#13;
              construction program contained in this program of works&#13;
&#13;
              being carried out by Kaiser engineers.&#13;
&#13;
                   There therefore remained a gap of approximately&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             4&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          $55 million. And this sum the company expected or hoped&#13;
&#13;
                to be able to raise in India, though they undertook to con-&#13;
&#13;
                sult with the Bank from time to time about their financing&#13;
&#13;
                plans.&#13;
&#13;
                     Since that time, the new share issue has been success-&#13;
&#13;
                fully made, and the company has also arranged with its&#13;
&#13;
                bankers to extend its credit facilities by an additional&#13;
&#13;
                $20 million or thereabouts .&#13;
                                               .&#13;
                     However, the growing stringency in the Indian capital&#13;
&#13;
                market in the last 12 or 18 months has made it extremely&#13;
&#13;
                unlikely that the company could raise the remain:1.ng $35&#13;
&#13;
                million in India on reasonable terms.&#13;
&#13;
                     At the same time, the Government of India, in view of&#13;
&#13;
                the strain on the country's balance of payments, has been&#13;
&#13;
                anxious that any investment involving a substantial amount&#13;
&#13;
                of foreign exchange should be financed, so far as possible,&#13;
          i!&#13;
          il    abroad.&#13;
          11&#13;
&#13;
          !i"        And for these reasons, the chairman of the Tata Iron&#13;
          i!&#13;
          11&#13;
          li&#13;
          I'&#13;
                and Steel Company came to Washington in February last for&#13;
          Ii&#13;
          ll&#13;
          ii    consultations with the Bank.&#13;
          1'&#13;
          !1&#13;
          i          As the Board will recall, you, sir, proposed at a meet-&#13;
&#13;
                ing in July that further Bank lending to the company should&#13;
&#13;
                be considered in the present year provided that the company&#13;
&#13;
                could raise as much as half the remaining requirement from&#13;
&#13;
                other sources.   Armed with this promise, the company has&#13;
&amp;#12;       II&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         5&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
            been successful in arranging through the intermediary of&#13;
&#13;
            First Boston to borrow a total of $15 million from a nwnber&#13;
&#13;
            of United States and Canadian commercial banks and trust&#13;
&#13;
            companies.   This is the largest swn which has yet been raised&#13;
&#13;
            by Indian enterprise in the North American market.&#13;
&#13;
                 The balance of $2.5 million which is required to make&#13;
&#13;
            up the total of $55 million has been provided by the State&#13;
&#13;
            Bank of India.&#13;
&#13;
                 The proposed loan is, therefore, in essenceJ a joint&#13;
&#13;
            operation by the Bank and the market.   However, it has&#13;
&#13;
            been judged convenient by all parties to the loan that&#13;
&#13;
            the commercial banks should make their contributions avail-&#13;
&#13;
            able as participations in a Bank loan rather than separately,&#13;
&#13;
            and the Bank loan would therefore be for a total of&#13;
&#13;
            $32.5 million or the equivalent in other currencies.&#13;
                 The main reason for this was the desire on the part of&#13;
&#13;
            the commercial banks that their contributions, their loans,&#13;
&#13;
            should have equal security with that of the Bank and that&#13;
&#13;
            in particular there should be a Government guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
                 It is proposed that the first five maturities of the&#13;
&#13;
            loan beginning in 1960 should be sold to the   com~ercial&#13;
&#13;
            banks at a rate of interest of 5-3/4 per cent per annwn.&#13;
&#13;
                 The World Bank has agreed not to call on the contribu-&#13;
&#13;
            tions of the banks until the middle of next year, but since&#13;
&#13;
            the company will be in need of funds before that time to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                6&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          complete its program, the Bank has agreed with the company&#13;
                  to make its contribution available as soon as the loan is&#13;
                  declared effective, though with the proViso, as in the case&#13;
                  or the first loan, that there would be a limit on withdrawals&#13;
                  in the interval between the making of the loan effective&#13;
                  and the completion of security arrangements.&#13;
                          In other respects the new loan and the loan docwnents&#13;
          il      follow the pattern of the first loan, and certain amendments&#13;

          H               As the report foresaw, there has been a continuing&#13;
                  decline in the reserves of the central government, though&#13;
                  this decline has been somewhat slower since the middle of&#13;
                  the year.     In fact, the latest figures which we have for&#13;
                  the last week in October show an actual gain in foreign&#13;
                  exchange reserves, though it's too early to say whether this&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           7&#13;

          represents a turn of the tide.&#13;
                    We do know that there were exceptional strains on the&#13;
            reserves in the middle of this year owing to the drawing of&#13;
            the Burma loan and the drop in value of sterling securities,&#13;
            and it is possible that a change in the trend is now taking&#13;
            place.&#13;
                    In the course of last month the reserves began to&#13;
            approach the minimwn level required by law in India, and the&#13;
            minimum was thereupon reduced by government ordinance.&#13;
                    The reason given by the government in its announce-&#13;
            ment was that this would give it the necessary freedom of&#13;
            maneuver to bring the foreign exchange problem under con-&#13;
            trol.&#13;
                    Dr. Basch, who took up his appointment as representa-&#13;
            tive of the Bank in India last month, is following the&#13;
            situation closely and keeping the Bank fully informed.&#13;
                    We understand that instructions were sent out some&#13;
            little time ago    by the   Ministry   or Finance to central&#13;
            ministries and to the state governments giving them the&#13;
            criteria on which they should base their estimates for the&#13;
            coming budget year, an indication of which we have.        These&#13;
            estimates, which are to be presented in the course of the&#13;
            next few weeks, will be incorporated in the budget, and we&#13;
            expect that by February of next year sufficient material will&#13;
            be available for the Bank to be able to judge the effect or&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       8&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          the measures of the last few months aimed at curbing loss&#13;
            in reserves and the new measures which are proposed in the&#13;
            budget.&#13;
                 Meanwhile, we understand that an investigation is&#13;
            being carried out by the Planning Commission on the direct&#13;
            instructions of the Prime Minister, with the aim not of&#13;
            assigning responsibility but of finding out why the situation&#13;
            with regard to the reserves has gone the way it has, and the&#13;
            findings are expected to be announced quite shortly.&#13;
                 Itâ&#128;¢s expected that as a result of this inquiry there&#13;
            will be a new set of conventions governing the relations&#13;
            between the Planning Commission and the central&#13;
            ministries which should help to prevent a similar situation&#13;
            from occurring in the future.&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you, sir.&#13;
                 Mr. Ripman.&#13;
                 MR. RIPMAN:     Mr. Chairman, it is now about 18 months&#13;
            since the existing loan to the Tata Steel Company was pre-&#13;
            sented to the Board.     During that time the companyâ&#128;¢s&#13;
            earnings have improved and have, in fact, exceeded the esti-&#13;
            mates made then by some 25 per cent.&#13;
                 Mr. Goodman has explained to you the financial situation&#13;
            in which the company finds itself.&#13;
                 As far as the project is concerned, I am glad to be&#13;
            able to report to you that the progress or construction has&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         9&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          been extremely well maintained in the face of what have been&#13;
              quite considerable difficulties.&#13;
                   There was early in the program the various delays in&#13;
              transportation arising out of the closing of the Suez&#13;
              canal.   There were actual or threatened delays in the manu-&#13;
              facture of certain important items of equipment, in particular  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              crucial cranes from Japan and rolling mill equipment from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   There has been a continuing and serious congestion in&#13;
              the port of Calcutta which threatened to be a bottleneck&#13;
              for the transportation of the very heavy volume of imported&#13;
              equipment to the site of the project, but all these diffi-&#13;
              culties have been overcome.&#13;
                   The company and their consultants working in the closest&#13;
              and most harmonious cooperation have managed to foresee&#13;
              and to avert and overcome these difficulties.&#13;
                   The consultants working in their offices in California&#13;
              and ln thelr field offices at the site in Jamshedpur, in&#13;
              Calcutta, and in Germany, all of which I have visited at&#13;
              least once during these last 18 months, have performed&#13;
              their duties in a remarkably efficient manner, and the com-&#13;
              pany in its offices in London and in New York particularly&#13;
              has played no small part in overcoming these difficulties.&#13;
                   Thanks are also due in this respect to the Executive&#13;
          i   Directors for Germany and for Japan who assisted the company&#13;
&amp;#12;          'I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         10&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          in reducing the delays in deliveries which were threatened&#13;
               from those two countries.&#13;
                    In consequence, today, when the work of erection or&#13;
               machinery at the site is at its peak, we find ourselves able&#13;
               to foresee that the whole job, all the main elements at any&#13;
               rate, is likely to be finished pretty well on time and&#13;
               that the plant will in all probability begin to make its&#13;
               important contribution to the Indian economy the middle of&#13;
               next year.&#13;
                    This is a very fine achievement indeed.&#13;
                    And what is no less remarkable is that this big con-&#13;
               struction program is going to be finished virtually without&#13;
               exceeding the cost estimates which were made two years ago.&#13;
               And this is indeed a tribute to the accuracy or those&#13;
               original estimates and to the efficient way with which the&#13;
               program has been carried out in all its phases.&#13;
                    When it is finished, the total capitalization of this&#13;
               plant w1ll be less than $125 a ton equivalent or annual&#13;
               ingot capacity, and if one had tcday to build a new plant&#13;
               of this capacity, the capital cost would be more than twice&#13;
               as much.&#13;
                    The cost   or   production of finished steel from this&#13;
               plant will be of the order or $55 a ton, which makes the&#13;
               company one of the lowest-cost producers of steel products&#13;
               in the world.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        11&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              Every ton that the company can produce will be urgently&#13;
            needed for India's development program and will save that&#13;
            country a ton or imported steel which would cost about twice&#13;
            as much in foreign exchange.&#13;
                 The financial projections show that the company should&#13;
            be comfortably able to service its debt, including the&#13;
            loan now proposed, and we have no hesitation at all in&#13;
            recommending this project for further financing.&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:   Thank you, sir.&#13;
                 Before I ask for any questions, you were told that&#13;
            nine banks have agreed to participate in this loan in the&#13;
            first five maturities.   These banks and the amounts are as&#13;
            follows:&#13;
                 The First National City Bank or New York, the Bank&#13;
            of America National Trust and Savings Association, and the&#13;
            Chase Manhattan Bank are taking $3,500,000 apiece.&#13;
                 The Royal Bank of Canada, New York Agency, $1,500,000.&#13;
                 The Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company, New York&#13;
            Agency, $200,000.&#13;
                 The Chemical Corn Exchange Bank and the .Manufacturers&#13;
            Trust Company or New York, both $1,000,000 each.&#13;
                 Northern Trust Company of Chicago -- this, incidentally,&#13;
            is the first time this bank has ever participated in any&#13;
            foreign transaction -- $300,000.&#13;
                 The Philadelphia National Bank, $300,000.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       12&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                The National Bank of Washington, $200,000.&#13;
                That makes a total of $15,000,000.    There are ten&#13;
         banks.&#13;
                The currencies that will be required by the borrower&#13;
         for the project of the first loan and also thia loan are as&#13;
         follows.    As far as the first loan is concerned, I 1 m talking&#13;
         about undisbursed currencies, not talking about those that&#13;
         have been disbursed, but the currencies that will be used&#13;
         for undisbursed parts of the first loan and this loan&#13;
         will be about $31 million, $10 million of pound sterling,&#13;
         $27 million in German marks, and $2.9 million in Japanese&#13;
         yen.&#13;
                Now, are there any questions?&#13;
                Mr. Donner.                                                 i&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
                MR. DONNER:   I have two questions.&#13;
                Referring to what Mr. Goodman told us and what in&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
         substance I found put down on page l of the Presidentâ&#128;¢s report~&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;
         I wonder about the following:                                      I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;
                The additional financing needed by Tata was estimated&#13;
         to be $55 million.    Then Tata came and told the Bank that&#13;
         they would be able to procure in India from the State Bank&#13;
         of India 20 millions only, so that there would be the rest&#13;
         to be financed in the magnitude of $35 million.&#13;
                The Bank said the Bank would take one-half of that pro-&#13;
         vided the other half would be contributed by private in-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 13&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          vestors.&#13;
              Later on then&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:     I 1 d like to correct that.    We said we&#13;
         would participate in half or it if they 1 d get the other half&#13;
&#13;
         somewhere else.&#13;
&#13;
              MR. DONNER:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:     We didn 1 t say "private. 11   We said   11&#13;
                                                                              some-&#13;
         where else. 11&#13;
&#13;
              MR. DONNER:     Excuse me.   Yes.   Somewhere else.&#13;
               Later on, then, it turned out that Tata was able to&#13;
         procure $31.5 million from the State Bank.&#13;
              The Bank remained at its offer, as far as I see, to&#13;
          take $17.5 million if others would contribute as much.&#13;
&#13;
              As things now stand, therefore, the money scratched&#13;
&#13;
          together for Tata does not add up to 55 any more, as was&#13;
&#13;
          originally envisaged, but adds up to 64 million dollars.&#13;
               Later on I believe, in the technical report or some-&#13;
         where, or toward the end of the President's report, it was&#13;
         pointed out that due to the fact that the State Bank of&#13;
          India has supplied more than the $20 million originally en-&#13;
          visaged the company has come into a snug cash position,&#13;
&#13;
          liquidity position.    And this, of course, is a good effect&#13;
&#13;
         and maybe this was the purpose of why the $35 million to be&#13;
&#13;
         financed -- that figure -- was left.&#13;
              But I wonder.     Has there then taken place during the&#13;
&amp;#12;          ,,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               14&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          course of the negotiation a change in mind to the effect that&#13;
               then later on it was considered to be good for Tata to pro-&#13;
               vide additionally not only 55, the original figure, but&#13;
&#13;
               the higher figure of 64?&#13;
                       To continue just my sentence, just this one sentence,&#13;
&#13;
               I would have thought the State Bank of India coming out&#13;
               with 31 instead of the 20 would have had the result of re-&#13;
               ducing the margin to be financed both by the Bank and private&#13;
&#13;
               investors or by this Bank alone.&#13;
                       MR. GOODMAN:   I agree, sir, that the figures are a&#13;
               little difficult to put together, but, in fact, the explana-&#13;
               tion is that the credit from the State Bank of India,&#13;
&#13;
               150 million rupees, or approximately $31 million, was&#13;
               originally designed as working capital, and the total&#13;
               finance available to the company when added up, including&#13;
               that element, comes to more than the total cost of the pro-&#13;
               ject.     In fact, the cost of the project in dollars is about&#13;
&#13;
               260 million.     They would have available more like 263&#13;
               million dollars in one form or another, part of which is&#13;
               working capital.&#13;
                       Now, the arrangement made in regard to the State Bank&#13;
&#13;
               is that the company already had facilities at the time the&#13;
&#13;
               first loan was made of 40 million rupees, or about $8 millioni&#13;
                                                                                    i&#13;
               and that was increased as stated in the report to $31      million~&#13;
                                                                                    !&#13;
&#13;
               or   that $31 million, $2.5 million has been earmarked as a&#13;
&amp;#12;         'I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              15&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          loan to match the contributions        by   the private market&#13;
              here -- rather, to make up the shortage between the amount&#13;
              contributed from private sources here and the amount of the&#13;
              Bank loan.   And the remainder of the $31 million remains as&#13;
              working capital on a demand basis.&#13;
                   So that thereâ&#128;¢s about 20 millions of additional credit&#13;
              available to the company, credit facilities, plus loan of&#13;
              $2.5 million.&#13;
                   MR. DONNER:     So then it has always been the idea that&#13;
                                                                                   i&#13;
              the $55 million were meant to refer only to the investment           I&#13;
&#13;
              of fixed capital needs?                                              I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                   MR. GOODMAN:     That's right, sir.                             I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                   MR. DONNER:     And beyond that there were always   considera~&#13;
&#13;
              tions and negotiations under way to increase the working&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
              capital?                                                             I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                   :MR. GOODMAN:    Yes.   It is, of course, facilities availab~e&#13;
              to the company which they may or may not use â&#128;¢ There ' s a&#13;
              margin there.&#13;
                   The company has, quite rightly I think, made provision&#13;
              for drawings up to an amount greater than they think they&#13;
              will need, and that is the margin represented by the 150&#13;
              million rupees facilities.&#13;
                   In fact, they will only draw a part of that for the&#13;
              construction program in addition to the amount subscribed by&#13;
              the Bank, by the private banks, and from their own resources.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      16&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              MR. DONNER:     Then I have a second question which prob-&#13;
           ably also refers to Mr. Goodman.&#13;
               The arrangement with the ten private banks is a very&#13;
           intricate one.   May I ask is that the first time that this&#13;
           Bank has entered an arrangement like this?&#13;
                Here the banks have taken over the first five years&#13;
           of maturities.   The arrangement of the schedules is obviously&#13;
           very much dovetailed to the needs, to the wishes, the&#13;
           desires or those private banks, whereas on other occasions&#13;
           there is set up an amortization schedule and the banks then&#13;
           just take over what they like in this amortization&#13;
           schedule.&#13;
                This time the amortization schedule has obviously been&#13;
           tailored to their needs.&#13;
                That 1 s one point.&#13;
                And the other point is the understanding which exists&#13;
           about the World Bank paying in first and the private banks&#13;
           making available their contribution only beginning July&#13;
           1958, so that thereby the maturities they take over are&#13;
           shortened by about a year in comparison to what would be the&#13;
           situation if they would pay in right away.&#13;
                Now, I think if these arrangements are weighed to entice&#13;
           private capital or private ban~ to participate, which&#13;
                                              \&#13;
           otherwise they would not do, it's an ingenious way.     And my&#13;
           question refers to the problem, to the fact, whether maybe,&#13;
&amp;#12;         \!&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               17&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          with the Bank now being flexible, as has been so often&#13;
              stated, that might indicate another scheme, a new scheme, of&#13;
              working out relationships with participants.&#13;
                   THE CHAIRMAN:    I can answer that.&#13;
                   First of all, you say we tailored this loan to some&#13;
              extent to meet the requirements of the banks.        Thatâ&#128;¢s true.&#13;
              We tailored it without Jeopardizing the loan.&#13;
                   We think that the Tata Iron and Steel are perfectly&#13;
              capable of repaying it in the schedule.&#13;
                   MR. DONNER:     Oh, yes.   Thatâ&#128;¢s pointed out in the report.&#13;
                   THE CHAIRMAN:    This isnâ&#128;¢t the first time weâ&#128;¢ve done this&#13;
              Yes, we did it in order to attract banks.        The banks are&#13;
              short of money.    Money is ve'l!'J' tight.   And we found that if&#13;
              we could agree to make disbursements first and allow the&#13;
              banks to delay their disbursements it would make it more at-&#13;
              tractive to them when they didn't have any money.&#13;
                   And the fact that they donâ&#128;¢t make disbursements until&#13;
              six months from now, which makes the maturities shorter,&#13;
              makes it all the more attractive to them, because they want&#13;
              short paper.&#13;
                   Yes, we did this to lure the banks or woo the banks,&#13;
              whatever you want to call it -- to get them in because of the&#13;
              tight money situation.&#13;
                   MR. DONNER:     I also would congratulate the banks.&#13;
              These negotiations were under way before the rediscount rate&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          18&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          was reduced, so they obviously entered the engagement en-&#13;
            visaging on their part there might take place in the future&#13;
            decline in interest rates.      Now all the winds seem to indi-&#13;
            cate their judgment was quite right.&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:      I don 1 t think they did it because they&#13;
            knew the discount rate was going to be changed.&#13;
                 MR. DONNER:      Knew not, no, but one has a hunch.&#13;
                 MR. CALLAGHAN:      Five and three-quarters for four years&#13;
            isn 1 t bad anyway.&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:      Any other questions?&#13;
                 Mr. Lieftinck?&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:      Mr. Chairman, I also have a few ques-&#13;
&#13;
            tions to ask, but first I would like to congratulate both&#13;
            you and the Tata Company for having been successful in&#13;
            getting ten American and Canadian banks and trust companies&#13;
            in for such a considerable amount.       I think it is a great&#13;
            achievement.&#13;
                 It proves that Tata Company is inspiring confidence not&#13;
            only in the sight of the Bank but also in the sight of the&#13;
            conmercial banks in this country and Canada.&#13;
                 It is a pity that the background of the general&#13;
            financial conditions of the country involved, of India, is&#13;
            not as good as one would like it to be.        I don't think there'4&#13;
            any doubt that the Indian foreign exchange reserves are&#13;
            getting somewhat on the low side.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        19&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              After deduction of the Indians' liabilities to the&#13;
            International Monetary Fund, which would be considered as&#13;
            short-term obligations, the last of October India 1 s foreign&#13;
            exchange reserves had almost come down to the level of its&#13;
            external public debt, and the government seems to be prepared&#13;
            to let them drop further as indicated by the draft ordi-&#13;
            nance on the currency backing provisions of the Reserve Bank&#13;
            of India.&#13;
                 Now, in my opinion, there must be somewhere a limit to&#13;
            be adaptable to deterioration or this ratio between foreign&#13;
            exchange reserves and external debt from the point of view&#13;
            of confidence in India's financial policies and its capacity&#13;
            to pay and repay.&#13;
                 And I wonder whether this limit is not rapidly&#13;
            approaching.&#13;
                 Therefore, I would like to ask whether the management of&#13;
            the Bank is attaching.any significance not so much to&#13;
            Indiaâ&#128;¢s external liquidity position at present but to the&#13;
            philosophy of the Indian Government with respect to the&#13;
            countryâ&#128;¢s external liquidity as such.&#13;
                 From the statement made by Mr. Goodman, I am inclined&#13;
            to take it that the management is fully aware of this problem:&#13;
            and has it constantly in mind.   But I would like to ask&#13;
            whether this ratio between foreign exchange reserves and&#13;
            the external debt is considered of real significance in&#13;
&amp;#12;         '!&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          granting additional loans to India.&#13;
                   THE CHAIRMAN:     My   answer to that is:   Yes, it is.&#13;
                   MR. LIEFTINCK:    Now, with your permission, sir, I have&#13;
              another question to ask which relates more to the technical&#13;
              report.&#13;
                   The discussion in the technical report, which is a very&#13;
              good one on the whole, is not too clear with respect to the&#13;
              impact of government policies on the utilization or re-&#13;
              sources generated by the private steel companies for the&#13;
              financing or their future expansion.&#13;
                   It appears that the prices of steel products are con-&#13;
              trolled and that retention prices have been established&#13;
              which enable the government to retain part of the margin&#13;
              between cost and prices to be used for the equalization&#13;
              fwid which subsidizes import steel and provides funds&#13;
              for the expansion of the industry.&#13;
                   This policy must in some way or other have reduced the&#13;
              possibility or internal financing by private companies.&#13;
                   But, on the other hand, the government is granting&#13;
              considerable tax facilities in respect to new investments.&#13;
              It has been allowed to run in arrears of payments due to&#13;
              the equalization fund.        And the government has made an&#13;
              advance or 100   ~illion     rupees which is considered as equity.&#13;
                   My question is:        What does this mean on balance?    On&#13;
              one hand, the retention of part of the margin between cost&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          21&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          and profits to implement the equalization fund, and on the&#13;
            other hand the tax facilities and financial assistance&#13;
            given.     If we drew a balance, could one say that the&#13;
            government policies expressed to this company have facili-&#13;
            tated internal financing or have hampered their internal&#13;
            financing?&#13;
                 MR. RIPMAN:     Up to a certain point the company was&#13;
            obtaining, as a result of this limitation of the proportion&#13;
            of its selling price which it might itself retain, a return&#13;
            which undoubtedly discouraged further investment in the&#13;
            company.     It represented that to the government, and&#13;
            in consequence the government changed the retention prices&#13;
            after the Tariff Commission had studied them.     And on&#13;
            balance there is no question at all that during the last&#13;
            years the governmentâ&#128;¢s policies have helped the company to&#13;
            manage, to finance, and to construct its new facilities.&#13;
            Thereâ&#128;¢s no question about that at all.&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:     But is it correct that as a consequence&#13;
            of such assistance the government has now in hand a certain&#13;
            equity participation in the companyâ&#128;¢s capital?&#13;
                 MR. RIPMAN:     I would hardly call it an equity partici-&#13;
            pation.     It is a loan which is granted on terms which do&#13;
            not affect the company's profits either with regard to the&#13;
            payment of interest or with regard to the repayment of&#13;
            capital.     It is only repayable out of additional retention&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           22&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          earnings permitted to the company which do not come into&#13;
            question for some time yet, so that it would not affect the&#13;
            companyâ&#128;¢s profits or its credit standing when it canes to be&#13;
            repaid or when interest comes to be paid on it.     We have&#13;
            treated it as equity.                                               !&#13;
                                                                                '&#13;
                                                                                i&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:     Does it not give the government a certaid&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
            influence in the company?                                           I&#13;
                 MR. RIPMAN:     Yes, that is true, but at the same time&#13;
            one can say it 1 s not at all a predominating influence.            I&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:     May I just ask one final question, Mr.&#13;
            Chairman?&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:     Yes.&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:     In paragraph 48 or the technical report&#13;
            a discussion is devoted to labor productivity.     And there&#13;
            it appears that labor productivity has fallen since the be-&#13;
            ginning of the war.     The average output or finished steel&#13;
            per employee fell by about 20 per cent and has since then&#13;
            not increased.     At the same time, considerable investments&#13;
&#13;
            and modernizations have taken place.&#13;
                 But from this paragraph it appears that the reason&#13;
            why labor productivity has not risen has been that there are&#13;
            certain legal and social difficulties involved in any re-&#13;
            duction or the company's labor force.&#13;
                 We understand that for the future it is expected that&#13;
            when the expansion program will be executed this surplus&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          23&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          labor force will be absorbed.&#13;
                Now, my question is:     Is there any estimate of the con-&#13;
            sequences for the present cost level resulting from the sur-&#13;
            plus of labor?&#13;
                 MR. RIPMAN:     It is hoped that when the construction&#13;
            program is finished the new plant will work virtually with-&#13;
            out any increase in the total number of men employed,&#13;
&#13;
            and this is one of the reasons why it is mentioned in this&#13;
            report that the company hopes that by the end of this program&#13;
            to reduce its costs by some 20 rupees a ton, which, if it&#13;
            happens, will improve the profitability considerably, and&#13;
            they would not be subject to any reduction of their retention&#13;
            prices as the result of that increase in efficiency,&#13;
&#13;
                 MR. LIEFTINCK:    Thank you, sir.&#13;
                 THE CHAIRMAN:     I'd like to say this on one of your&#13;
            questions:   For some time the Tata people did not want to&#13;
            borrow any money from this Bank because of the necessity&#13;
            or having a governmental guarantee, and their concern that&#13;
            the government guarantee would allow the government to&#13;
            unduly interfere in their affairs.&#13;
                 But they finally decided that they did want to do it.&#13;
            And I don't think there's been any particular difficulty&#13;
            because of that since that time.&#13;
                 One of the things that disturbed us when we first were&#13;
            approached by the Tata people to lend them a substantial&#13;
&amp;#12;          II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                             24&#13;
                                          .   .&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          of money was the possibility that some day the company&#13;
               might be nationalized.   I think it's perfectly apparent&#13;
               that the Indian goverrunent today would feel that the steel&#13;
               business is a business that should be nationalized if&#13;
&#13;
               possible.&#13;
&#13;
                    And we were concerned as to making a loan to this&#13;
               company because of the possibility it might be later&#13;
                                                                                  1&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
               nationalized.   And we were rather curious to know why Tata wo~ld&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
                                                                                  !&#13;
               be willing to put a lot more money into this in case the           I&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
                                                                                  1&#13;
&#13;
               company might later become nationalized.                           i&#13;
                                                                                  i&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Well, I think the answer to that was that thereâ&#128;¢s such&#13;
               an urgent need for steel in India and will be for some&#13;
               time to come that it would be rather difficult for the&#13;
               Indian goverrunent, with all the other problems they have&#13;
           I&#13;
          I~&#13;
          ii   got, to nationalize these companies, and that in view of&#13;
               that Tata was willing to go ahead and make a substantial&#13;
               investment also, and we were too.&#13;
                    So I'd say that there's been no undue interference&#13;
               in their affairs by the goverrunent, and the relationship&#13;
               of Tata with the goverrunent is perfectly satisfactory.&#13;
                    Any questions?&#13;
&#13;
                    Well, if there are no other questions, may I have a&#13;
&#13;
               motion to adopt the draft resolution?&#13;
&#13;
                    (Motion made by Mr. Shoaib, seconded by Mr. Hockin.)&#13;
                    And to approve the participation at the same time.&#13;
