I. COUNTRYBACKGROUNDANDSTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
CountryBackgroundandFloodHistory&#13;
&#13;
1.    Djibouti i s a small country. Its population i s estimated at 500,000, two thirds o f which lives&#13;
inthe capital, Djibouti City. Itispoorlyendowed innaturalresources (limited arable land, rainfall&#13;
and undergroundwater.) It benefits, however, mainly from its strategic location on the Red Sea's&#13;
southern entrance for military and regional international shipping purposes. Djibouti's main&#13;
revenues come from the activities of its port and related transport and logistics business as well as&#13;
from the rental of military bases to France since independence in 1977, and most recently to the&#13;
U S and from the services associated with these bases. This i s reflected in the large share of the&#13;
service sector inthe economy which accounts for 70 percent o f GDP.&#13;
&#13;
2.    Djibouti's social indicators are amongst the lowest inthe world. Recent data from EDAM-&#13;
I S shows that poverty in Djibouti is both extremely high and increasing. In2002, about three&#13;
fourth (74 percent) o f the population lived under relative poverty line and 42 percent under&#13;
extreme poverty, compared to 45 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in 1996. While the&#13;
surveys show that the most dramatic poverty incidence is in rural areas as 83% o f the rural&#13;
population live in extreme poverty, Djibouti City shelters the largest number o f poor people and&#13;
contributes by itself to 65% and 57% to relative and extreme poverty, respectively. The study&#13;
finds that the incidence o frelative and extreme poverty is the strongest among households whose&#13;
heads are unemployed. Unemployment which is estimated at 52%, contributes to about 65% to&#13;
extreme poverty. Reinforced by cultural norms and practices, gender disparities in Djibouti&#13;
remain a challenge and are particularly apparent regarding education and health indicators, but&#13;
also in political participation. Among the poorest quintile, the percentage o f households headed&#13;
bywomen is nearly 25 percent'.&#13;
&#13;
3.    A large proportion of the population is clustered around the poverty line, indicating a&#13;
potential for significant increases inthe incidence o f poverty when the country i s hit by disasters&#13;
that are as devastating as the April 2004 floods. Donor funding to support recovery from flood i s&#13;
critical inensuring that the scarce government resources are not diverted from the achievement of&#13;
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards meeting urgent expenditures for disaster relief&#13;
and the rehabilitation o f damaged social and economic infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
4. Djibouti is prone to recurrent natural disasters, namely floods and droughts. Between 1977&#13;
and 2004, the country was hit by 6 devastating floods (respectively in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1989,&#13;
1994 and most recently in 2004) and 5 severe droughts (respectively in 1980, 1996, 1999, 2000&#13;
and 2001), each o f which affected over 90,000 persons. The floods o f 18 March 1981 killed 25&#13;
persons and affected over 100,000 persons. The floods o f 9 April 1989 lulled 10 persons and&#13;
affected over 150,000 persons. The floods o f 19 November 1994 killed 145 persons and affected&#13;
120,000 persons. While the floods o f October 1977 and February 1978 did not result in any&#13;
deaths, they have nonetheless affected respectively 91,000 and 106,000 persons.             And most&#13;
recently, on April 13, 2004, floods killed an estimated 100 persons and affected over 100,000&#13;
persons, some 15% o f the country's population. Inturn, each o f the five severe droughts affected&#13;
between 95,000 and 150,000 persons.&#13;

The FloodDamageAssessment of April 2004&#13;
&#13;
5.     Torrential rains and high winds hit Djibouti between April 11-13, 2004. On the night o f&#13;
April 13,2004, at about 2:OO AM, flash flooding washed away many houses locatedinand on the&#13;
banks o f the Ambouli river Oued, which separates Djibouti city in two parts. An estimated 100&#13;
persons died as a result o f the floods and a large number o f persons are still missing to date.&#13;
Overall, according to government estimates, the floods affected over 100,000 persons and the&#13;
estimated cost of the damages has roughly been estimated by government officials at about DFr 2&#13;
billion (US$l 1.3 million).&#13;
&#13;
6.     The Djebel and Ambouli quarters were the hardest hit areas, with most casualties occurring&#13;
among the low-income population who lived in makeshift housing on squatter land on the&#13;
Ambouli Oued banks inareas known as Quartier Bombages and Phare d'Ambouli and among the&#13;
population engaged in agricultural activities and whose houses were located within the Oued. In&#13;
addition, many o f the streets and houses in Ambouli, Djebel and the neighboring Quartier 7,&#13;
Quartier 7 bis and the Gabodes (1 through 5) were flooded with about 1-1.5 meters o f water, after&#13;
the flood broke through several parts o f the eastern bank o f the Oued, breaking among other&#13;
things a protection dyke that had been erected after the 1994 floods by a philanthropist who had&#13;
witnessed its effects. Flood water inits course throughout the affected areas carried much debris&#13;
and scattered solid waste, which rapidly clogged both the open and covered stormwater drainage&#13;
channels and culverts, thereby slowing the drainage process. Floods caused the overflowing o f&#13;
many parts o f the drainage network (which i s also used to dispose o f used water) and also septic&#13;
tanks inthese districts, which created a health hazard.&#13;
&#13;
7.     According to WHO estimates, some 600-700 houses were entirely destroyed or severely&#13;
damaged (some beyond repair). The govemment estimates that some 1,500 households lost all&#13;
their possessions inthe flood and their houses are quite damaged. Finally, an estimated 100,000&#13;
persons-20,000     households-living    inthe low-lying quarters that subsequently faced the runoff&#13;
o f the flood waters were also affected, facing various degrees of losses depending on the height o f&#13;
the water level.&#13;

8.     The flood's impact was not restricted to Djibouti city; it also affected the country's major&#13;
infrastructure. The railway line betweenAddis Ababa and Djibouti city, which carries at least 700&#13;
tons o f imported food to Djibouti every week, was temporarily closed after flood waters swept&#13;
away parts o f the line. Inaddition, the road to Ethiopia (RN1) was temporarily cut o f f after the&#13;
collapse o f a bridge, which interruptedmovement o f the approximately 1,000 trucks that transport&#13;
each day imports for Ethiopia fiom the Port o f Djibouti (a key part o f the logistical chain that i s&#13;
one o f the backbones o f the Djiboutian economy). Inaddition, the intersectionbetween the road&#13;
to Ethiopia and the road to Arta was also damaged as a result o f the floods.&#13;
&#13;
Government's Responseto the Emergency&#13;
&#13;
9.     The Minister of Interior immediately activated the government's multi-sectoral national&#13;
crisis management plan, known as Plan ORSEC, to coordinate relief and assistance efforts. Plan&#13;
ORSEC, created inMarch 1985 by Presidential Decree and placed under the Ministry o f Interior&#13;
(MoI), was previously activated twice after the 1989 and 1994 floods. The Plan ORSEC consists&#13;
of setting up an emergency unit whose role i s to provide immediate relief services and assess the&#13;
scale of the damage and an Etat-Major consisting o f the heads o f the key public sector agencies&#13;
that i s convened at the request o fthe MoI. As such, M o I convened a Comite ORSEC for Djibouti&#13;
City, headedby the Commissaire o f Djibouti city (Mayor o f Djibouti city, who i s also head of the&#13;
Djibouti district) and including key line ministries' departments (in charge o f education, health,&#13;
sanitation, public works, equipment, etc), EDD, ONED and Djibouti-Telecom (respectively the&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
authorities in charge o f electricity, water and telecommunications), the Djiboutian army and&#13;
police forces, the French and U S troops stationed in Djibouti, the Red Crescent, the referral&#13;
hospital, which were later joined by UN and donor agencies as well as NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
10.    Govemment agencies, in partnership with the private sector, civil society organizations,&#13;
donor agencies and the French and U S troops, focused their efforts along three axes: (i)             the&#13;
provision of immediate food and non-food assistance to the displaced families, (ii) clean up o f&#13;
                                                                                         the&#13;
the damages in the flooded areas, and the (iii)   rehabilitation o f the critical affected infrastructure.&#13;
The Djiboutian armed and police forces undertook a search and rescue effort, relocating hundreds&#13;
of displaced and distressed families from the flooded areas to Cheikh Osman Camp and later to&#13;
the Balbala 2 primary school. Food and blankets were subsequently distributed to the displaced&#13;
families sheltering in the school. The bodies o f about 60 persons that were killed in the floods&#13;
were buried and a search for other bodies washed away by the floods was initiated. The armed&#13;
forces also launched a clean up operation in the Oued and city streets to remove the corpses o f&#13;
cattle and organic waste that were washed away to prevent the spread o f epidemics. The armed&#13;
forces joined by the U S and French troops also undertook to pump flood water out o f the city&#13;
streets.&#13;
&#13;
11. In terms of urgent infrastructure rehabilitation, hundreds o f workers were deployed to&#13;
conduct rapid repairs o f the electricity, telephone and water supply networks inDjibouti City that&#13;
were damaged as a result of the heavy rains and floods. The aerial medium and l o w voltage&#13;
distribution networks were damaged in the flooded areas, and parts o f the underground cables.&#13;
The water production and distribution systems were also affected, as were the aerial telephone&#13;
cables inthe flooded areas. All services were 90% restored within 2-7 days, although some o f the&#13;
repairs are reported by the authorities to be o f provisional type. In addition, rapid repairs to the&#13;
damaged railway tracks were undertaken to resume vital freight movement (7 rupture points were&#13;
identified between Djibouti City and Goubetto).        In addition, a by-pass around the destroyed&#13;
bridge on the RN1 was rapidly created by the Direction des Travaux Publics (TP) to resume the&#13;
trucks' movement along this important regional road untilrepairs o f the bridge take place.&#13;
&#13;
12.    Rapid deployment by the Ministry o f Health, with assistance from WHO and UNICEF, in&#13;
addition to the coordinatedclean up activities by the different stakeholders inthe Comite ORSEC&#13;
of Djibouti city (which also received assistance from the French and U S troops stationed in the&#13;
city) have thus far prevented the outbreak o f epidemics. Clean up is, however, far from being&#13;
complete since much debris remains scattered throughout the affected areas in addition to a 50-&#13;
lOOcm thick layer of mud that ensued. In addition and almost two months after the floods, the&#13;
authorities are still discovering corpses that have been washed far away, and as such there are still&#13;
alerts against possible outbreaks o f cholera or malaria.&#13;
&#13;
13.    Of the hundreds o f people evacuated from the flooded areas to the Cheikh Osman Camp,&#13;
many families then took shelter with relatives. The remainder, 605 persons, were then relocated&#13;
from the camp to the Balbala 2 primary school. A census o f the relocated population listed 466&#13;
Djiboutian citizens and 139refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia (respectively 62 and 77 persons).&#13;
These families were then resettled in tents in PK12, a site on the periphery of Djibouti city&#13;
accessible from the road to Ethiopia and which houses about 14,000 persons (about 2,300&#13;
households), who have mostly been relocated there after the 1994 floods. The government has&#13;
initiated plans o f building400 social housing units for the displaced families using assisted self-&#13;
help housing. These units will be provided on individual land parcels o f 105 sq.m each. The plan&#13;
is for government to give the families legal land titles to the parcels and for the Social Housing&#13;
Fundto provide buildingmaterials for core houses (one room, one kitchen and one bathroom) and&#13;
training to the families on construction activities.     The families will then be responsible for&#13;
buildingtheir own core houses. A large portion o f the fundingneeded for this operation has been&#13;
assembled through a fund-raising effort         among leading private sector and civil society&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
organizations.    Some private sector companies have also committed to pay for building the&#13;
houses o f the single-female headed households, elderly population and others who will be unable&#13;
to contribute their sweat equity. The problem, however, i s that the government lacks the funds&#13;
needed to deliver basic infrastructure services to these households, as well as to the existing&#13;
population living inPK12.&#13;
&#13;
14.    The damage assessment report produced by ComitC ORSEC on April 15, 2004 estimated&#13;
the damages at FDj 1.758 billion (not including the MoH's estimates o f damages in the health&#13;
sector, which were not yet provided). These are as follows:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
15.    ComitC ORSEC's damage assessment report stipulates two priority interventions neededto&#13;
take place immediately: 1) the provision o f food assistance to the 20,000 affected households and&#13;
2) the resettlement o f the displaced and affectedpopulation, estimated at 1,500 households, inthe&#13;
new resettlement site PK12. These 1,500 households include the 400 Djiboutian families whose&#13;
housing was destroyed by the floods and an estimated 1,100 households whose makeshift houses&#13;
on squatter land inthe Quartier Bombage (an area o f Ambouli district) were severely affected due&#13;
to its presence in the flood prone area. Another 100-200 households of Ethiopian and Somali&#13;
origins are not included inthe land distribution and resettlement operation. The cost o f resettling&#13;
these 1,500 households was roughly estimated at FDj 150 million on account o f FDj 1million per&#13;
household.&#13;

11.      IDA'S RESPONSE TO THE FLOOD         EMERGENCY&#13;
&#13;
Elements of IDA'SResponse&#13;
&#13;
16.    During a visit in May 2004 to Djibouti by the Regional Vice President, Mr. Christiaan&#13;
Poortman, the Bank received a request fiom the Government for an emergency assistance&#13;
program inresponse to the devastating April 2004 floods. Subsequently, a multi-sectoral mission&#13;
visited Djibouti in the period between June 8-14, 2004 and worked closely with the Government&#13;
and the donor community (UN agencies, the EU, and bilateral donors) to identify government&#13;
priorities and needs and coordinate with other donor-financed ongoing projects and emergency&#13;
related activities. The Djiboutian authorities, represented by HE the Minister o f Finance, the&#13;
Prime Minister's Office and HE the Commissaire o f Djibouti, laid out the government's priority&#13;
needs and interventions as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Rehabilitation of Ambouli Oued bank and damaged flood protection structures within the&#13;
       affected areas;&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0 Rehabilitation o f damaged social and economic infrastructure;&#13;
    0 Delivery of basic infrastructure services to the resettlement zone in which the authorities&#13;
      relocated the population whose housing was destroyed, a much needed intervention to&#13;
      complement the government's efforts o f distributing land parcels to the families and&#13;
      financing the construction o f social housing unitsfor them; and&#13;
    e Assistance inlong-term disaster prevention efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.   The mission designed an emergency assistance program that is primarily focused on the&#13;
immediate needs for the rehabilitation and reconstruction o f damaged economic and social&#13;
infrastructure and the delivery of basic infi-astructure services to the resettlement zone, in addition&#13;
to capacity buildingfor long-term disaster preventionmanagement, inthe following ways:&#13;
&#13;
18.   Preliminary damage assessment: In close cooperation with the Government, the Bank&#13;
assessed the damages to the flood protection structures within the affected areas, the damages to&#13;
the social and economic infi-astructure (health centers, schools, inner city roads and regional&#13;
highways, the water supply, electricity and stormwater drainage systems) and the losses incurred&#13;
by the population.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Population losses: Approximately 100 bodies have been recovered to date, although the&#13;
        number of still missing persons may yet add to the death toll as the floods are feared to&#13;
        have washed many bodies and debris to remote places. Inaddition, about 600 households&#13;
        were made homeless after the flood completely destroyed their houses (mostly makeshift&#13;
        structures, although a few were inreinforced concrete and masonry). These populations&#13;
        were concentrated inthe Quartier Ambouli and the Bombage and Phare d'Ambouli areas.&#13;
        Another 900 households faced serious damage to their houses and property in the same&#13;
        areas. Finally, the majority of the population o f the Ambouli, Djebel, Quartiers 7 and 7&#13;
        bis, and the five Gabodes quarters, estimated by the authorities at 20,000 households,&#13;
        faced some damage to their properties (especially furniture and enclosure walls) as a&#13;
        result of the 1-1.5m o f flood water that filled streets inthe neighboring areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Schools: A total of seven schools (one secondary and six primary schools) were&#13;
        damaged. The flood's impact ranged from damage to properties (fences, plastering,&#13;
        doors, electrical and plumbing systems, etc) and damage to both equipment (school&#13;
        furniture, computers, etc) and teaching material (school books). The U S army provided&#13;
        assistance to the authorities inrepairing damages to the physical structures in some of the&#13;
        primary schools, with assistance still needed in the provision o f equipment and teaching&#13;
        materials.   The badly damaged secondary school (CS Ambouli) is in need o f both&#13;
        physical rehabilitation and the acquisition o f new equipment including laboratories and&#13;
        teaching material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Health centers: A total o f four community health centers were damaged. The floods'&#13;
        impact ranged from damage to the properties (destruction o f fences, plastering, doors,&#13;
        electrical and plumbing systems, etc) to damaged fumiture and medical equipment&#13;
        (fumiture, computers, etc), with needs o f physical rehabilitation and the acquisition of&#13;
        new equipment including laboratories and teaching material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Flood protection structures: A 2,500m longprotection dyke on the eastern embankment&#13;
        of the Ambouli Oued, with a height o f about 4 m from the Oued riverbed level, was&#13;
        severely damaged by the floods. The other problem that contributed to the worsening&#13;
        impact of the April floods was that sedimentation deposits (as a result of past rains) and&#13;
        encroachment by agricultural plots led to the narrowing down of several areas throughout&#13;
        the Oued riverbed's course, with areas in which the width was reduced to just 20m. This&#13;
        affected the direction and force o f the water flow duringthe floods.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     0   Roadsand drainageinfrastructure:The roadto Ethiopia (RN1) faced several damages.&#13;
         The first segment o f the road which suffered damages runs from Djibouti City to the&#13;
         intersection with the Ali Sabieh road. Works are underway to rehabilitate this segment&#13;
         with EUfunds. The other part o f RNl which suffered damages is a 39km segment from&#13;
         the intersection with Ali Sabieh road to Dikhil. This i s the remaining part o f the IDA-&#13;
         financed   "International Road Corridor" project, which was scheduled to be completed&#13;
         shortly. A bridge at PK35 was cut and the intersection o f RN1 with the road to Lake&#13;
         Assal (PK51) was damaged, in addition to scattered damage to the road surface. Given&#13;
         the urgency o f rebuilding the fallen bridge at PK35, a variation order was issued to the&#13;
         contractor to initiate reconstruction work o f the bridge. In addition, inner city streets&#13;
         were damaged after 1-1.5m high flood water ran through city streets, carrying much&#13;
         debris and causing damage to the road surfaces and sidewalks.                 According to&#13;
         Government's estimate, 18km o f streets were damaged and will need to be resurfaced.&#13;
         Finally, as the flood water gradually subsided by being channeled to the sea through&#13;
         drainage channels, the debris and solid waste it carried and an ensuing mud layer o f 60-&#13;
         80cm clogged an estimated 5km o f drainage channels, both open channels and closed&#13;
         culverts and caused the breakdown o f electro-mechanical equipment in three&#13;
         lifting/pumpingstations.&#13;
&#13;
         Water sector:The water sector incurred damages to both the production and distribution&#13;
         networks. Damages to the production network were particularly rapidly rehabilitated.&#13;
         The sector's main problem is that in its Ambouli site, which i s adjacent to the Oued, all&#13;
         the spare parts, chemical products for water chlorination, etc were washed away with the&#13;
         flood, with the result i s that ONED i s severely under-equipped to undertake its urgent and&#13;
         regular operation and maintenance activities.          Since the floods, ONED has been&#13;
         chlorinating water usinglocally purchased chlorine products that are not ideally suited for&#13;
         the job. ONED i s still unable to fix a leak in Brazzaville avenue due to a lack o f spare&#13;
         parts.&#13;
&#13;
     0   Electricity sector: The electricity sector suffered physical damages including the&#13;
          flooding o f a power generating station (although the rapid intervention to pump water out&#13;
          largely reduced the damage), damages to the medium and low-voltage distribution&#13;
         network, especially l O k m o f low-voltage distribution lines that were washed away, the&#13;
         water-caused damage to several transformer sub-stations, and the destruction o f 1,000&#13;
          connections (of which only 600 can be rehabilitated).&#13;
&#13;
19.    Urgent rehabilitation: In view o f the extent o f the damage and the need for immediate&#13;
assistance, IDA has prepared a plan o f action for 1) rehabilitating damaged economic and social&#13;
infrastructure and 2) improving living conditions through the provision o f basic infrastructure&#13;
services to the displaced households inthe new resettlement zone to which they were relocatedby&#13;
the government after their houses were destroyed as a result o f the floods.&#13;
&#13;
20.   Long-term rehabilitation: Given that a devastating flood recurs every 10 years in Djibouti&#13;
and that the country i s equally prone to such natural disasters as droughts and epidemics, an&#13;
equally important objective in this context i s to assist the government in formulating a long-term&#13;
strategy aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to flooding and other disasters. The three&#13;
critical initiatives in this context are to: a) develop a long-term strategy to reduce the occurrence&#13;
of devastating floods inthe Ambouli Oued, b) develop a long-term disaster management strategy,&#13;
and c) provide institutional support in the form o f capacity building and training to the existing&#13;
institution mandated to take charge o f disaster prevention and management, namely the newly&#13;
established but poorly equipped "Disaster Management Unit" under the Ministry o f Interior.&#13;
With respect to the first activity, the MOAhas prepared TOR for the needed study and the EUhas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
committed Euros 4 million for financing the study and some o f the needed works that will ensue&#13;
from the study. With respect to the second activity, UNDP i s currently financing the study,&#13;
which i s expected to be completed shortly. The study will provide a framework for long-term&#13;
disaster management and recommendations for action including for institutional strengthening.&#13;
As such, and in coordination with parallel donor-financed activities, the IDA project intends to&#13;
provide institutional support in the form o f capacity building and training to the "Disaster&#13;
Management Unit" so as to better enable to undertake the important mandate for which it was&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for IDA involvement&#13;
&#13;
21.    The damages caused by the April 2004 floods are estimated at approximately FDj2 billion&#13;
(or US$11million) and are equivalent to 5% o f total annual public expenditures as budgeted for&#13;
FY2004. The rehabilitation of the damaged social and economic infrastructure and restoration of&#13;
services to pre-flood levels would represent a severe strain on the Government o f Djibouti ifit&#13;
were to finance them out o f its scarce resources. To attempt to do so would divert resources from&#13;
core programs of poverty reduction, and it i s very unlikely that all services would be restored (at&#13;
least in the short term) to their pre-flood conditions, and that all urgent priorities would be&#13;
addressed. In particular, the delivery o f basic infrastructure services to the resettlement zone&#13;
would almost surely not happen in the foreseeable future. This would imply that the resettled&#13;
families will either live in PK12 under very harsh conditions, or return to squat in their former&#13;
flood-prone locations or elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
22     The Government has recognized these constraints and relies on the donor community and&#13;
specifically on IDA to intervene with additional financial resources. Specifically, the Government&#13;
has requested IDA to exert the leadership and the coordination among donor agencies and to&#13;
intervene directly with its own resources to address the most critical and urgent needs. This&#13;
request i s based on IDA'Strack-record o f projects in Djibouti, on its global experience with&#13;
emergency recovery operations, and on its proven operational capacity.&#13;
&#13;
23     As such, puttinginplace the proposedIDA-financed emergency flood rehabilitationproject&#13;
provides a critically important and timely intervention to rehabilitate the damaged social and&#13;
economic infrastructure, improve the living conditions o f the most affected families in their&#13;
resettlement zone, as well as preventing further catastrophic events through the rehabilitation of&#13;
the Oued and related infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
EconomicImpact&#13;
&#13;
24.    As an emergency flood rehabilitation credit to restore existing basic social and economic&#13;
infrastructure that has been damaged by the floods, economic and financial analysis was deemed&#13;
unnecessary and was thus not undertaken. Instead, the benefits and social impacts were assessed.&#13;
Overall, the project i s expected to have significant benefits, especially in the cases where the&#13;
marginal investment in rehabilitation works will restore the functioning o f an otherwise&#13;
interrupted service. This is especially the case with the rehabilitation o f College d'Ambouli, the&#13;
seven primary schools and four health centers. The rehabilitation o f College Ambouli and the&#13;
seven primary schools will accommodate thousands o f students, who may otherwise start the new&#13;
academic year with delays or dispersed in other far away schools. The rehabilitation o f the four&#13;
health centers will accommodate a total population o f about 80,000- 100,000 persons, and thus&#13;
reduce the strain currently placed on other unaffectedhealth centers.&#13;
&#13;
25.    The rehabilitation of the water infrastructure by enabling ONED to undertake back-logged&#13;
and urgent O&amp;M needs will benefit not only Djibouti City but also the other five districts, with an&#13;
conservatively estimated population o f 275,000 inhabitants in urban and rural areas (benefiting&#13;
55% of the total population). The rebuilding o f the fallen PK35 bridge will restore normal traffic&#13;
                                                  7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
between Djibouti City and Addis Ababa, which benefits among others the approximately 1,000&#13;
trucks that use the road daily and which today have to take an unpaved bypass road. The&#13;
rehabilitation o f seven important city streets which has been damaged will have a similarly&#13;
positive impact on inner city traffic. In particular, three roads (EDD, Sogik and Transversale)&#13;
serve the southern industrial zone, which will benefit the industries and warehouses located there.&#13;
Both the rehabilitation o f the Ambouli Oued and o f the clogged stormwater drainage network will&#13;
also have a positive impact on the 100,000 persons inhabiting the flood-prone quarters of Djibouti&#13;
City. Finally, the delivery of basic potable water supply through appropriately located standpipes&#13;
will not only benefit the 400 affected households but also the 2,000 households already living in&#13;
PK12 (victims o f the 1994 flood), while the delivery o f pit latrines will improve sanitary&#13;
conditions for the 2004 flood victims.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
26.     Indesigning its response to the emergency, the team drew from the advice of staffbased&#13;
inthe Bank's Disaster ManagementFacility. Advice was also taken from Bank teams, projects&#13;
and research publications in responding to similar emergencies in the MENA region and other&#13;
parts of the world, including Asia and Latin America.'       The two key lessons that emerged in&#13;
designing projects responding to disasters are: 1) Project design needs to be kept simple, and 2)&#13;
Expediency and coordination between the different government and donor agencies are key to&#13;
project implementation. Other relevant lessons included the preference for having one agency&#13;
implement the project to ensure efficiency and expediency. Moreover, taking into account that&#13;
women and men experience disasters differently and that the structure o f entitlement and&#13;
implementation programs can reduce or preserve gender inequalities, the project makes an effort&#13;
to promote women's and men's opportunity for transferring decision making, implementation,&#13;
and resources to poor communities and promoting gender equitable development over time.&#13;
&#13;
27.   Particular importance was attached to learning from the experience o f implemented and&#13;
ongoing IDA projects inDjibouti. The mission drew from the advice o f Bank staff with Djibouti&#13;
country experience and coordinated with ongoing projects, especially in the health and education&#13;
sectors. Experience with operations inDjibouti is consistent with lessons learnt from emergency&#13;
rehabilitation operations and suggests three important lessons for the design of the current&#13;
project: 1) the need to keep project design as simple as possible, 2) the need to have the project&#13;
managed by one capable organization, preferably ADETIP as it has previous IDA project&#13;
experience and the necessary capacities in management, accounting and small contract&#13;
procurement, in addition to familiarity with Bank procedures including sound environmental&#13;
management practices (ADETIP staff also received training in sound environmental management&#13;
procedures and its capacity to satisfactorily implement sound environmental measures has been&#13;
demonstrated in past/ongoing IDA and other donor-funded projects and are reflected in its&#13;
Operation Manual), and 3) the need to develop a specific and detailed implementation plan&#13;
upfront to avoid other factors such as political pressure influencing the outcome o f loosely&#13;
defined components.&#13;
&#13;

      project administration.&#13;
&#13;
Project Cost and Financing&#13;
&#13;
31. The total project cost, including contingencies, i s estimated at U S 7 . 1 7 million equivalent,&#13;
with a foreign exchange component of US$4.95 million equivalent (69%).           The IDA portion i s&#13;
estimated at US$6.45 million equivalent (US3.23 million equivalent in IDA grant and US$3.23&#13;
million equivalent in IDA credit). IDA financing     covers about 90% of total project cost. The&#13;
Djibouti government and civil society contribution o f U S 0 . 7 2 million (10% o f the total project&#13;
cost) to the settlement o f the flood victims in PK12, the government at the central and district&#13;
level and its agencies (CDE, ONED, EDD, Djibouti-Telecom, and DEMOTEto mention a few)&#13;

&#13;
Iv.      INSTITUTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
                         ARRANGEMENTSANDPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
&#13;
32.      Since this project i s executed with the financial support o f the World Bank, Djibouti&#13;
authorities fully understand related obligations. Therefore, the Borrower agrees to implement the&#13;
project while respecting the conditions pertaining to the fiduciary obligations o f the World Bank&#13;
on Procurement, Disbursement, protection of the environment, social aspects, and resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
33.      Project implementation arrangements have been streamlined to conformto the emergency&#13;
nature o f IDA'S assistance.     The project will be coordinated and monitored by a Steering&#13;
Committee that will be chaired by the Prime Minister's Office and will include the Commissaire&#13;
of Djibouti City, Disaster Management Unit, the Ministry o f Agriculture, the Directorate of&#13;
Housing and Urbanism, DAI, the Housing Fund, DEMOTE,International Road Corridor project,&#13;
ONED, and ADETIP.&#13;
&#13;
34.      A Steering Committee will ensure that procurement procedures are in compliance with&#13;
those of the World Bank. It will also ensure full coordination o f all contributions offered by the&#13;
donors community to avoid any duplication o f efforts to rehabilitate flood damages.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Implementation o f the different project components will be carried out by ADETIP,&#13;
which i s currently implementing the Social Fund and Public Works Project having a total IDA&#13;
credit of US$ 20 million equivalent and an AfD project for the delivery o f infrastructure and&#13;
community development activities (Euros 3.5 million).&#13;
&#13;
36.     The existing operations manual of ADETIP will be updated to include the new&#13;
implementationarrangement o f FEW as it already does under PDSTIP.&#13;
&#13;
37.     ADETIP will prepare follow-up and status reports and the monitoring tables including&#13;
performance indicators to be submitted to the SC and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
38.     ADETIP will be remunerated equivalent o f 6% o f total cost o f the project for its&#13;
management and operating cost. Therefore, ADETIP will put in place adequate financial and&#13;
procurement capacity to ensure proper management and implementation o f the new project&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Financia1Management Assessment&#13;
&#13;
39.      A s the project will be implementedby ADETIP (the Agence Djiboutienne d'Exicution des&#13;
Travaux dYntir2t Public), which i s currently implementing an ongoing IDA project (Social&#13;
Development and Public Works project) therefore, an assessment o f the financial management&#13;
(FM) arrangements for the proposed project was undertaken to determine whether they are&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The assessment concluded that the Agency possess a sound financial&#13;
management system that provides accurate and up-to-date information regarding sources and uses&#13;
o f funds to the borrower and IDA. The agency's current FM arrangements, therefore, meets IDA's&#13;
minimumrequirementsand are acceptableto IDA.&#13;
&#13;
40.      Project Financial Management Risks: The ADETIP is currently implementing an ongoing&#13;
IDA funded project with success, the current applied FM arrangements meet IDA's minimum&#13;
requirements, therefore, the overall risk i s rated as low. To control the risk and maintain it low for&#13;
the new project, it was agreed with the ADETIP management that there i s a need to (i)          hire an&#13;
additional qualified accountant (or Chief accountant as the position i s vacant) to be in charge o f&#13;
handling all project's accounting transactions (under the supervision o f the Finance Manager). (ii)&#13;
to hire a qualified procurement officer to handle the procurement function for the project.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Accounting System: Under an on-going IDA project, all accounts are maintained at&#13;
ADETIP. All disbursements from the Special Account are centrally authorizedand executed by the&#13;
ADFETIP and are included in the computerized accounting system. All funds received from&#13;
different sources (IDA, other Donors, and GOD)are identified separately. It i s recommended that&#13;
ADETIP follow the same accountingprocedures for the proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
42.      To ensure that a proper Accounting system will be put in place, the following i s&#13;
recommended:&#13;
     0   Creation o f a new accounting entity on the current accounting system in the name o f the&#13;
         new project.&#13;
     0   Updating the chart o f accounts to reflect the proposed project's components and detailed&#13;
         activities in accordance to the Intemational Accounting Standards and as described in the&#13;
         Technical Annex;&#13;
     0   As currently applied in the undergoing project, ensure that a proper filling system is&#13;
         maintained by the ADETIP to document all eligible disbursements under different&#13;
         categories in the new project. These documents should be made available for review to&#13;
         Bank's representatives during supervision missions and to auditors at year-end.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Staffing: Currently the Finance department i s constituted o f the Finance &amp; Administration&#13;
Manager and one accountant who are responsible for the implementation o f all ongoing projects&#13;
implemented by the ADETIP (currently around four projects). The Finance Manager has a good&#13;
experience ofthe requirements o fthe bank's funded projects. However, it was noted that the current&#13;
staffing level requires to be increased to ensure that proper and timely capturing of the project's&#13;
financial transactions it was agreed with the ADETIP management that a qualified accountant (or&#13;
Chief accountant as the position i s vacant) shouldbe hired with a primary responsibility to maintain&#13;
all accountingtransactions o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
44.      In addition, and with regard to the procurement function, the appraisal missionnoted that&#13;
there was no procurement officer in charge o f handling all procurements in the ADETIP especially&#13;
what i s related to the IDA project. A s currently all technical procurement (e.g. construction,&#13;
technical work, etc...) i s handled by the technical director, while all procurement related to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social activities (e.g. hiring o f consultants, selection o f NGOs, etc.. .) i s maintained by the social&#13;
development officer inthe ADETIP. All other sorts o f procurements are maintained by the Finance&#13;
and Administration Manager as part o f his capacities. I t was agreed with the ADETIP management&#13;
that for the purpose o f the new project, a specialized and qualified individual should be appointed&#13;
as a procurement officer to maintain all types o f procurements.&#13;
&#13;
45.      Financial Management Manual: A comprehensive and well defined FM Manual is&#13;
currently applied under the ongoing projects implemented by the ADETP (IDA and/or Other&#13;
donors). It was agreed that this manual will be updated (as necessary) by the project's Financial&#13;
Officer to reflect the design o f the new project including adequate control procedures and proper&#13;
segregation o f duties among incompatible functions.&#13;
&#13;
46.      Reporting: Currently, the projects accounting software generates quarterly financial&#13;
reports which are sent to the Bank 45 days after the end o f each quarter. It was agreed with the&#13;
Financial Officer that for the new project, he will be responsible for issuing a full set Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on a quarterly basis in addition to the annual Project Financial&#13;
Statements. The format and content o f the FMR (including financial, procurement and physical&#13;
progress reports), which will be produced 45 days from each quarter closing date, will be&#13;
prepared in accordance with the "FMR for World Bank-Financed Projects, Guidelines For&#13;
Borrowers" issued inNovember 30, 2002. The report should be designed to reflect the actual vs&#13;
budget performance and written explanations for variances (ifany). Final formats o f FMRs to be&#13;
used shouldbe included inthe Financial ManagementManual.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Audit Arrangements: Annual audits will be conducted by independent private &amp;&#13;
qualified  auditors acceptable to the Bank. Terms o f reference o f the audits (subject to IDA&#13;
approval) will clearly reflect the nature o f the project and its exact needs and will also ensure that&#13;
that the project as a "whole" i s covered inthe scope o f the assignment. The cost o f the audit will&#13;
be financed from grandloan proceeds. The audit report and opinion, accompanied by a&#13;
management letter, will cover the project's financial statements, reconciliation and use o f the&#13;
Special Accounts, use o f direct payments and withdrawals based on SOEs. The audit report&#13;
should also include annexes identifying separately the source o f uses o f funds by financier (i.e.&#13;
the Grant, the Credit andthe GOD).The report shouldbe submitted to the Bankwithin six months&#13;
following the closing o f the fiscal year. The external audit report should encompass all project&#13;
activities under the credidgrant agreement, be in accordance with the Bank's auditing&#13;
requirements and be conducted according to International Standards on Auditing.&#13;
&#13;
48.      IDA'S Close Supervision: Close supervision by IDA will entail regular FM missions to&#13;
review work done and to ensure that the developed system is maintained in a consistent manner.&#13;
Also, identified financial management risks will be continually evaluated and appropriate remedial&#13;
measures taken duringthe Bank's supervisionmissions.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement:&#13;
&#13;
49.      The proceeds o f the credit would be disbursed in accordance with the traditional&#13;
Disbursement procedures o f the Bank and will be used to finance project activities through the&#13;

purpose, or to submit applications for direct payment to the Bank. As projected by Bank's&#13;
standard disbursement profiles, disbursements would be completed four months after project&#13;
closure.&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50.     Special Account (SA): To facilitate disbursement o f eligible expenditures the&#13;
Government will open and establish in a commercial Bank acceptable to the Bank a special&#13;
account in U S Dollars to cover credit's share o f eligible project expenditures. The special account&#13;

Department staffed by a procurement specialist with experience in IDA procurement procedures.&#13;
Due to the extension o f services required for the FEW, the Technical Department of ADETIP&#13;
will be strengthenedby adequate number o fprocurement officers having good experience inIDA&#13;
procurement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
 64.     Capacity Assessment: An assessment o f the capacity o f ADETIP to implement&#13;
procurement actions for the project has been carried out on October 13, 2003 and cleared by the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 65.   Implementation Risks: Most o f the issuesf risks concerning the procurement component for&#13;
 implementation o f the project have been identified and include: (i)weak mechanism o f&#13;
 monitoring and evaluation for ongoing activities and for staff performance, (ii)        weak capacity in&#13;
 implementing CDD activities, (iii) planning, and (iv) slow preparation o f BDs and RFPs.&#13;
                                     weak&#13;
&#13;
 66.     The recent Capacity Assessment Report rated the risk for procurement as HIGH. As a&#13;
 result, areas o f risks were addressed during the preparation o f FEW by the following measures:&#13;
 (i) preparationofacompleteprocurementplanofalltheprojectactivities,(ii) therecruitment&#13;
    the&#13;
 of an accountant and a procurement officer to support the new project operation, (iii)           defining the&#13;
 terms of reference o f the Steering Committee, (iv) enhancing the coordination between the&#13;
 Project and the beneficiary public services.&#13;
&#13;
 67.     Therefore, the overall project risk for procurement i s MEDIUM.&#13;

Project Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
75.    The proposed project earmarks a portion o f the investment towards providing institutional&#13;
support and capacity buildingfor long-term disaster prevention and management by assisting the&#13;
newly created DMU to better undertake its mandate. This is intended to enhance the project&#13;
sustainability and mitigate against the recurrence o f such devastating floods or other disasters.&#13;
Currently, the only efforts towards such long-term effort i s the UNDP-financed long-term disaster&#13;
prevention and management strategy, but no funds are as o f yet available for the implementation&#13;
o f the strategy's recommendations. As such, the proposed IDA project becomes the first entity to&#13;
investinlong-term disaster preventiodmanagement activities for the sake o f sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
76.    Inaddition, the project's investment in delivering basic infrastructure services in PK12 is&#13;
intended to transform this currently very poorly serviced resettlement zone in which government&#13;
relocated the displaced families (and which has an existing population o f 14,000 inhabitants) into&#13;
a viable place for living. Inparallel, the AfD-financed, ADETIP-implemented project inPK12 i s&#13;
meant to enhance the site as a viable place for living and to create a viable community there.&#13;
Finally, the government's investment in Doraleh Port, o f which financing has been arranged for&#13;
&#13;
                                                                19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the petroleum terminal that i s expected to be completed in 12-18 months, will further strengthen&#13;
the locational appeal o fPK12 and contribute to direct and indirectjob creation.&#13;
&#13;
Environment and Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
77.    A s the proposed project i s primarily geared towards the rehabilitation o f existing social and&#13;
economic infrastructure, its negative environmental and social impacts are by definition minimal.&#13;
The only project component o fpotential modest impact i s the Oued rehabilitation over the 2.5km&#13;
stretch facing the populatedparts o f the city that are most vulnerable to flooding.&#13;
&#13;
78.    Inprinciple, the Bank's OperationalPolicy on Involuntary Displacement (OP 4.12) does&#13;
not apply to people whose housing or economic activities were displaced by the floods since they&#13;
are refugees from natural disaster. Yet, the project's financing o f flood control works inthe Oued&#13;
rehabilitation project may end up-depending on final designs-displacing fewer than 200&#13;
current residents or economic activities, thereby triggering the policy and requiring an&#13;
abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Indeed, rebuilding the protection dyke may tum&#13;
out, depending on the final design o f its alignment v i s - h i s the existing condition on the ground,&#13;
to necessitate partial/full relocation o f several makeshift housing units, which suffered from&#13;
significant  flood-related damages and whose occupants were reportedly relocated to PK12.&#13;
Similarly, the enlargement o f the Oued riverbed to an average width o f 60-70m is expected to&#13;
require that the public domain remain as a protected area for the Oued riverbed to restore its flood&#13;
water drainage ability to an acceptable level. As a consequence, agricultural plots that had&#13;
encroached over time and that have been entirely washed away by the flood will not be allowed&#13;
to encroach again in the future on the public domain consisting in the Oued riverbed. The IDA&#13;
team recommended that the Government provide compensation and socio-economic support to&#13;
the farmers who lost their agncultural plots to the flood. The widening/leveling works may also&#13;
require that parts o f the encroachments by few adjacent agricultural plots be returned back to the&#13;
public domain. Most such takings are expected to constitute minimal portions o f the plots, except&#13;
infew cases (where the Oued bed has narrowed down to a width of 20m) where the talung may&#13;
be more substantial. Intum, the adjacent agncultural plot owners will benefit from a reinforced&#13;
embankment, created from the excavation material from the Ouedriverbed.&#13;
&#13;
79.    Whether or not the project's financing o f flood control works in the Oued rehabilitation&#13;
project may end up displacing current residents or economic activities and thereby triggering OP&#13;
4.12 and requiring the preparation o f a RAP cannot, however, be determined prior to&#13;
effectiveness and before the design studies for the civil works are carried out. Should a RAP be&#13;
needed, it will be undertaken by the SC with ADETIP's assistance during the feasibility studies&#13;
and the preparation o f the Environmental Assessment (EA), which will be in the form o f an&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) as explained below. Preparation o f the EMP and o f the&#13;
RAP, if necessary, will be a condition for the no-objection in moving ahead with the Oued&#13;
rehabilitation's civil works.   Terms o f reference for the RAP, if needed, will be drafted in&#13;
consultation with and cleared by the MNA Regional Safeguards Coordinator.&#13;
&#13;
80.    Overall, the project's negative environmental impacts are expected to be localized and&#13;
limited in nature, which places the proposed operation in Category (B) in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). Thus, the project will only&#13;
require limitedEA, namely an EMP with the intention o f undertaking corrective measures as part&#13;
o f the project. However, given the emergency nature o f the operation and the need to produce a&#13;
rapid intervention, the EMP as well as the determination o f the applicability o f OP 4.12 will be&#13;
undertaken after effectiveness and in parallel with project implementation so as not to block the&#13;
disbursement o f urgently needed funds for the rehabilitation o f schools and health centers,&#13;
replacement of damaged text books, etc. This is in accordance with OP 4.01 section 13 on&#13;
emergency recovery projects, which applies to this project. A waiver to this effect was approved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
on July 2,2004, by the RVP. Terms o f reference o fthe EMPwill be drafted on or before July 15,&#13;
2004 inconsultation with and cleared by MNA Regional Safeguard and Environmental Advisor.&#13;
&#13;
81.     Inaddition, the potential and minor negative environmental impacts will be avoided by&#13;
providing instructions in the contract documents that specifically address environmental issues in&#13;
a manner acceptable to the Bank, as well as following Good Management Practices during&#13;
reconstruction.   ADETIP, which would be in charge o f project implementation, has received&#13;
training in sound environmental management procedures and its capacity to satisfactorily&#13;
implement sound environmental measures has been demonstrated in previous IDA and other&#13;
donor-funded projects and i s reflected in its Operations Manual.&#13;
&#13;
ParticipatoryApproach&#13;
&#13;
82.   Guidelines for beneficiary participation will be included in the Operational Manual. It i s&#13;
important to note that ADETIP, the project implementing agency, has significant experience in&#13;
working with NGOs and CBOs in its IDA and other donor-financed projects. Most importantly,&#13;
ADETIP is currently implementing an AD-financed infrastructure and community development&#13;
project in PK12, which i s the same area where government settled the flood victims. The project&#13;
hinges on the development and strengthening o f community-based associations, called ComitCs&#13;
de DCveloppement de Quartiers (CDQs) at the basis o f all activities. ADETIP will ensure that the&#13;
flood victims will be integrated in community development activities and that economic and&#13;
community development activities tailored to the needs of the flood victims will be developed.&#13;
To this end, the participation o f women and women's NGOs will be given special attention to&#13;
ensure that women's needs and gender relations are being addressed throughout the project. The&#13;
preference o f associations as delivery mechanisms would also favor women's participation.&#13;
Finally, the delivery o f basic infrastructure services through both the AD-financed and proposed&#13;
IDAprojects, will ensure that PK12can become a livable andviable community.&#13;
&#13;
83.   It is important to note that the emergency flood rehabilitation efforts have witnessed the&#13;
participation of all stakeholders: government agencies, the private sector, civil society, the donor&#13;
community, as well as the French and U S troops stationed in Djibouti. The Djiboutian society&#13;
showed solidarity in the aftermath o f the disaster, with donations of food and other basic needs'&#13;
assistance large enough to have not required assistance from the World Food Program. Similarly,&#13;
the private sector responded to the authorities' call for donations to the government-administered&#13;
program for the construction o f new housing to the flood victims whose houses were washed&#13;
away. Some FDj 260 million were pledged to build 400 assisted self-help housing units and FDj&#13;
117 million already collected.&#13;
&#13;
Considerationsto VulnerableGroups&#13;
&#13;
84.   The project i s designed with special attention to the needs o f vulnerable groups, including&#13;
low-income households, women, children and the elderly. The project's focus on rehabilitating&#13;
damaged social and economic infrastructure is primarily to the benefit of lower-income groups,&#13;
including first and foremost the flood victims and the population o f Ambouli, Djebel, 7 and 7bis&#13;
quarters. The delivery o f basic infrastructure services to PK12, especially water supply, benefits&#13;
not only the flood victims but the low-income and very poorly serviced existing population o f&#13;
PK12.     The IDA project's Oued rehabilitation component i s also primarily targeted at the&#13;
population o f the flood-prone area, which i s largely poor. The project's focus on rehabilitating&#13;
schools i s to ensure that children continue to have uninterrupted access to education, which along&#13;
with health are IDA'Stwo main areas o f focus in Djibouti. ADETIP will also ensure that&#13;
appropriate gender considerations are taken into account both in the proposed project and also in&#13;
its ongoing community development activities in PK12. One key area i s to advocate that titles to&#13;
the land parcels for housing the flood victims are issued as joint titles (in both spouses' names).&#13;
Finally, the needs o f the elderly and female-headed households among the flood victims are being&#13;
&#13;
                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
taken into account in the assisted self-help housing process; already a Djiboutian private sector&#13;
company has committed to financing the construction o f ten houses for flood victim families that&#13;
are not able to buildtheir own houses, especially the elderly and female-headed households.&#13;
&#13;
V.       PROJECTBENEFITSANDRISKS&#13;
&#13;
ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
85.    The proposed project will generate innumerable benefits to the national economy. It will&#13;
contribute to the restoration o f the economic and social infrastructure that were disrupted by the&#13;
severe damage due to the floods. Through the rehabilitation o f the damaged RN1 road, land&#13;
transport between Djibouti and Ethiopia can be resumed without trucks incurring the significant&#13;
delays, depreciation to their vehicles, and the risks o f damage to their cargo that they are currently&#13;
face when taking the unpaved bypass road. Similar gains, although more difficult to quantify,&#13;
apply to the rehabilitation o f RN9 and inner city roads, especially that the latter are as a result o f&#13;
the flood in very poor conditions. Restoring the storm-water drainage system i s equally crucial&#13;
for it will restore their discharge function o f waste water and ensure that in the event o f&#13;
subsequent floods or heavy rains, the system will function properly, thereby ensuring faster&#13;
drainage, efficient mobility throughout the city and less disruptions to citywide activities.&#13;
&#13;
86.    The benefits o f rehabilitating the Oued embankment and rebuilding the protection dyke (to&#13;
higher technical/engineering standards) along with restoring the Oued riverbed to a minimally&#13;
appropriate width (60-80m, so as to align with the span o f the RN1 bridge and thus allow for a&#13;
smoother flow of flood water) cannot be overstated. Such rehabilitation work will tremendously&#13;
improve the Oued's ability to drain flood water to the sea smoothly, which would greatly&#13;
minimize the risks o f human, physical and economic devastation. These works build upon and&#13;
will be hrther coordinated with the comprehensive study for the long-term rehabilitation o f the&#13;
Ambouli Oued throughout its entire span in the country. The study, which i s almost complete&#13;
and whose draft final report was made available to the IDA mission, is financed by the AfDB and&#13;
is expected to be validated by the authorities in July 2004 and its final recommendations&#13;
endorsed.&#13;
&#13;
87.    The rehabilitation o f the water authority ONED's ability to undertake back-logged and&#13;
urgent O&amp;M activities and the rehabilitation o f health and educational establishments will yield&#13;
equally important benefits. ONED serves a population o f about 350,000 persons inDjibouti City.&#13;
The rehabilitation o f the College o f Ambouli and the seven primary schools will respectively&#13;
allow college students and primary school students to resume normal educational activities, while&#13;
the rehabilitation of the four health centers i s expected to benefit a catchment population o f about&#13;
80,000-1 00,000 inhabitants inthe four communities served.&#13;
&#13;
88.    The delivery o f basic water and sanitation infrastructure services to the resettlement zone in&#13;
PK12 in which the authorities relocated the displaced families is expected to improve living&#13;
conditions for thousands o f low-income people. The improvement o f the water supply system&#13;
and provision o f four public standpipes will not only benefit the 400 households (an estimated&#13;
2,400 persons) that were recently resettled after the April 2004 floods, but also serve to improve&#13;
the very poor coverage o f water supply infiastructure for PK12's existing 14,000 inhabitants,&#13;
which are currently only served with two public standpipes (of which one is not working and&#13;
where weak water pressure i s a constant problem). The provision o f pit latrines will ensure that&#13;
the 400 resettled families live in better sanitary conditions than would be the case without IDA'S&#13;
intervention, an improvement that i s expected to make an important contribution to the reduction&#13;
o f diseases. Finally, investing inproviding institutional support and capacity buildingto DMUto&#13;
ensure that this newly created institution i s better equipped to better respond to disasters and&#13;
undertake preventive activities i s expected to yield long-term positive benefits.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
&#13;
89.  Despite the benefits, there are also risks that the project faces. These are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   Risk I: Institutional overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued rehabilitation&#13;
   project among government ministries: The risk o f institutional overlap, due to confused and&#13;
   overlapping mandates and which would result in lack o f coordination in the Ambouli Oued&#13;
   rehabilitation project, exists between three line ministries:&#13;
&#13;
       9        MOA,designated by the government as the line ministry in charge of overseeing&#13;
                and coordinating with the EU the financing o f a long-term study for the&#13;
                rehabilitation o f the Oued and subsequent financing o f some o f the works (within&#13;
                an overall budgetary envelope o f Euros 4.9m).        The TOR were prepared, the&#13;
                consultant selection process i s underway and the first pre-feasibility mission i s&#13;
                expected in September;&#13;
       ii) MoH, through DAI,which is havinga comprehensive sanitation strategy for&#13;
                Djibouti City financed by AfDB (including a component for the rehabilitation o f&#13;
                the Oued, for which the estimated cost ranged between FDj 230-560 million&#13;
                depending on the selected alternative) as a precondition for further AfDB&#13;
                financing o f works.     Despite the detailed study, DAI has limited resources&#13;
                (through direct transfer from the State budget) and the department may also be&#13;
                merged under ONXD shortly, which i s one o f the main institutional reform&#13;
                recommendations proposed by the study and which needs to be implemented if&#13;
                the EUi s to finance any subsequent works inthe sector; and&#13;
       iii) MOTE,throughDE,whichhasputforwardadesignbasedonagabion-based&#13;
                retaining wall and i s planning to work on the Oued bed rehabilitation.        The&#13;
                department i s better equipped than DAIbut acknowledges that it needs a detailed&#13;
                study to implement the work, and as such i s waiting for the outcome o f the EU-&#13;
                financed study under the MOA.&#13;
&#13;
   Proposed mitigation measures to Risk I: The proposed expansion o f ADETIP's steering&#13;
   committee (as explained in Section V) will ensure that a vehicle is in place for government&#13;
   coordination o f the different line ministries and agencies' work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Risk 2: Overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued rehabilitation project among&#13;
   donor agencies: A slight risk o f overlap and possible lack o f coordination in the Ambouli&#13;
   Oued rehabilitation project, exists betweenthe present IDA project, the EUand AfDB.&#13;
&#13;
   Proposed mitigation measures to Risk 2 Given that the EU-financed study for the long-term&#13;
   Oued rehabilitation i s expected to start shortly, the IDA team coordinated with the resident&#13;
   EU mission to have the designated consultant develop, by October 2004, a list o f urgent&#13;
   actions needed for the Oued rehabilitation within the 2.5km adjacent to Djebel and Ambouli&#13;
   quarters, so that these could be financed within the present project's envelope for the Oued&#13;
   rehabilitation. Alternatively, the current plans for dyke reconstruction and Oued riverbed&#13;
   rehabilitation proposed under this project will be given to the EU consultant for revision and&#13;
   validatiodamendment.       Similar coordination i s planned shortly with AfDB (which does not&#13;
   have a permanent representation in Djibouti) in addition to coordination with DAI, AfDB's&#13;
   counterpart inthe sanitation strategy.&#13;
&#13;
   Risk 3: Delays or cancellation o f implementation o fproject-related activities plannedby other&#13;
   entities (government andor donor agencies): This i s especially valid for project components&#13;
   which rely on coordination with other entities, namely the Ambouli Oued rehabilitation&#13;
   project and in the delivery o f basic infrastructure services to PK12 (which i s conditioned on&#13;
&#13;
                                                 23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the government's pursuit o f its plan o f distribution o f legal land titles and buildingmaterials&#13;
for housing constructionto the distressed families).&#13;
&#13;
Proposed mitigation measures to Risk 3: From the onset o f the project identification mission,&#13;
the IDA team has initiated coordination with all relevant/concerned government entities and&#13;
donor agencies and i s sustaining close cooperation with these entities to ensure coordination&#13;
o f activities. With respect to PK12 project, the Bank's no objection for the delivery o f basic&#13;
infrastructure services to the resettlement site i s conditioned on the government's prior grant&#13;
o f land parcels to the distressed families and the delivery o f buildingmaterials (for which the&#13;
necessary funds-FDj260       million-have   already been assembled through a fundraising effort&#13;
with the private sector inDjibouti).&#13;
&#13;
Risk 4: Minor relocation/resettlement risks as a result of the Oued rehabilitation project: The&#13;
rebuilding o f the flood protection dyke according to the preliminary design inplace may turn&#13;
out to necessitate the partial/full relocation o f one or two (makeshift) housing units, which&#13;
have been largely damaged by the floods. This risk cannot be ascertained until the actual&#13;
topographic survey (survey o f existing conditions) i s undertaken and the occupancy o f these&#13;
units ascertained (the houses seemed unoccupied at the time o f the mission visit, which may&#13;
be because the house occupants have beenresettled inPK12).&#13;
&#13;
Proposed mitigation measures to Risk 4: As a condition for the no-objection to proceed with&#13;
the protection dyke construction, the IDA team requested that a) the design o f the protection&#13;
dyke be revised (within the limits o f structural integnty) to avoid relocation o f any housing&#13;
structures; b) in case the one/two houses inquestion turn out to be occupied (as will a survey&#13;
ascertain) and their relocation unavoidable to implement such a critically important dyke, that&#13;
appropriate compensation i s provided to the families in question according to a resettlement/&#13;
compensation plan to be pre-approvedby IDA&#13;
&#13;
Risk 5: The resettled families do not want to remain in PK12 or they sell their new land&#13;
parcels and houses for which the project hasfinanced basic infrastructure), cash in on the&#13;
windfall profit and return to squat in theirformer location or elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Proposed mitigation measures to Risk 5: To help provide more accurate information on this&#13;
matter, the IDA mission drafted TOR for a rapid socio-economic survey o f living conditions&#13;
o f the distressed families inboth PK12 and intheir former locations (Quartier Bombages and&#13;
Phare d'Ambouli), designed to develop an understanding o f the extent o f their willingness to&#13;
remain in PK12 and o f their needs to improve living conditions (Annex 9). In addition, the&#13;
fact that PK12 is benefiting from four different donor-financed projects (including by A D&#13;
and IDA) providing socio-economic assistance and physical amenities including a paved&#13;
access road, a health center, a maternity center and a bus stop, constitutes a significant&#13;
contribution into malung PK12 a livable place. The proximity of PK12 to Port Doraleh and&#13;
its employment opportunities also makes the locationparticularly attractive, even ifit remains&#13;
somewhat far from the city center (12km). Finally, that ADETIP is currently implementing&#13;
community development associations and activities (with A D financing) in PK12-intended&#13;
to create a strong sense o f community and to act as a channel for economic development&#13;
activities-is  particularly propitious since ADETIP will ensure the integration o f the newly&#13;
resettled families within existing socio-economic structures/activities in place in PK12.&#13;
Finally, ADETIP has significant track record in working with NGO's/CBO's in its projects,&#13;
including inPK12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agreed Actions&#13;
&#13;
90.  Duringnegotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government o f Djibouti that&#13;
following measures will be undertakedensured by the Project Coordination Committee chaired&#13;
by the Prime Minister:&#13;
&#13;
  a.   Ensure the coordination between the different government line ministries and agencies in&#13;
       general, but especially in the Ambouli Oued rehabilitation project where there seems to&#13;
       exist an institutional overlap between three ministrieddepartments currently involved in&#13;
       different ways including studies and/or works: Ministkre de 1'Agriculture, de 1'Elevage et&#13;
       de la M e r (MOA), Ministkre de l'Habitat, de l'urbanisme, de 1'AmCnagement du&#13;
       Territoire (MoH) represented by the Direction de 1'Assainissement et des Infrastructures&#13;
       (DAI), and Ministhe de 1'Equipement et duTransport (MOTE)represented by Direction&#13;
       de 1'Equipement (DE);&#13;
 b.    Inthe Oued rehabilitation project, avoid to the maximum extent possible displacing any&#13;
       structures as a result o f the construction o f the protection dyke and the rehabilitation o f&#13;
       the Oued dry riverbed (pertaining to agricultural. Should property be taken inwhole or in&#13;
       part unavoidably, then put in place a system o f consultation, indemnification and where&#13;
       relevant a resettlement plan acceptable to IDA;&#13;
  C.   Ensure that all ministries and agencies with a stake in the different project components&#13;
       (ONED, DEMOTE,DAI/MoH, Ministry of Health, Ministry o f Education, Ministkre&#13;
       dClCguC A la Promotion de la Femme, etc) will take charge o f preparing the technical&#13;
       specifications for the works and goods to be procured and communicate these documents&#13;
       in time for ADETIP to prepare the BD and launch the procurement process in a timely&#13;
       basis;&#13;
  d.   Ensure that, prior to the construction o f the pit latrines in PK12, GODwill have granted&#13;
       the flood victims occupancy permits to the land parcels and that the housing construction&#13;
       process will be ready to start concurrently;&#13;
  e.   Ensure that ADETIP will commission a rapid socio-economic study o f living conditions&#13;
       o f the displaced families and inPK12 (See Attachment 10 o f the TA);&#13;
  f.   Ensure that ADETIP will strengthen its technical and accounting slulls by hiring&#13;
       additional staff and undertaking other necessary measures to ensure the smooth&#13;
       implementation o f the project; and&#13;
  5    Towards promoting gender equality and ultimately project sustainability, ensure women's&#13;
       obligatory participation in construction and service delivery committees; ensure that&#13;
       investment in capacity building(such as training or access /control o f resources) includes&#13;
       women; and ensure that the occupancy permits for the land parcels and the registration o f&#13;
       houses are issued in the name o f the couple or the female in the female-headed&#13;
       household.&#13;
&#13;
91.    Finally, it was agreed that a mid-term review will be undertakenby March 31,2006.&#13;

            Djibouti - Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Flood Emergency
            Rehabilitation Project is to rehabilitate the economic, and
            social infrastructure damaged by the April 2004 floods in
            Djibouti. The main benefits would be the restoration of
            services, through the rehabilitation of roads, bridges,
            flood control works, health centers, and schools. Despite
            its benefits, possible risks include: a) institutional
            overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued
            rehabilitation project among government ministries, and
            donor agencies, but mitigation measures include expansion of
            the Djiboutian Agency for Implementation of Publics Works -
            ADETIP - through the steering committee to ensure government
            coordination among line ministries and agencies, and,
            coordination with th European Union (EU), the United Nations
            Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development
            Bank (AfDB); b) minor relocation and resettlement risks as a
            result of the Oued rehabilitation project; mitigation
            includes that as a condition for the no-objection to proceed
            with the Oued rehabilitation component, the Bank requested
            that the protection dyke design and the widening/leveling of
            the Oued riverbed, avoid - to the maximum extent possible -
            the relocation of housing structures, and/or economic
            activities, and that a resettlement compensation plan be
            designed appropriately; c) the selling by flood victims of
            their lands and houses prompted the following mitigation
            measures: a rapid socio-economic study will be conducted to
            determine the extent of flood victims' willingness to
            remain in place, although the proximity to Port Doraleh, and
            its benefiting from several donor-financed projects, makes
            it a more viable, livable place. ADETIP will also ensure the
            integration of newly resettled families within existing
            socio-economic structures, and activities.
