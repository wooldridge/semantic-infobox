Note No.44   The Right to Borrow&#13;
Legal and regulatory barriers that limit access to credit by small farms&#13;
and businesses&#13;
HeywoodFleisig    When World Bank staff design credit programs in developing countries, they often find that lend-&#13;
ers in the formal banking sector show little interest in small farms and businesses. Although their&#13;
reluctance to lend is especially great for very small operators, such as artisans, street vendors,&#13;
and subsistence farmers, surprisingly, it extends even to more substantial operations with sev-&#13;
eral employees. Many explanations for this behavior have been posited, including banks' innate&#13;
conservatism, the high unit costs of small loans, class differences between bank officers and&#13;
small borrowers, excessively conservative bank regulation, and excessively loose bank regulation&#13;
that permits bank lending to related parties, crowding out the smaller, presumably unrelated,&#13;
borrowers. But another important explanation for this lending behavior lies in the laws, regula-&#13;
tions, and institutions of these countries. Though these may often spring from efforts to protect&#13;
unwary borrowers or the poor, they can instead force borrowers out of the formal banking sys-&#13;
tem and into the hands of the very lenders from whom they were supposed to be protected. This&#13;
Note, based on the results of Bank analysis, shows how such legal, regulatory, and institutional&#13;
barriers limit access to credit.&#13;

borrowers                                  taken from the debtor, banks will not accept it&#13;
as collateral. In a well-supervised banking sys-&#13;
Many countries have specific laws and regula-  tem, examiners will regard borrowers offering&#13;
tions that are intended to protect borrowers:    such collateral as unsecured. For such unse-&#13;
cured loans, bank regulations require more&#13;

            Many laws and regulations in developing
            countries drive small businesspeople out of the formal
            banking sector and into the hands of high-cost and sometimes
            unscrupulous moneylenders in the informal sector. The author
            looks at these barriers to credit for small farmers and
            firms and suggests solutions.
