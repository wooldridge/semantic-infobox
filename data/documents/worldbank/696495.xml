1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    This report presents the Brazil Health Sector Reform project for which a loan of&#13;
US$300 million to the Federative Republic of Brazil is proposed. Total project cost is&#13;
estimated at US$750 million. The loan would be a the Bank's standard variable interest&#13;
rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace. This report describes the&#13;
health sector in Brazil, analyzes the issues it faces, and presents the Government's strategy&#13;
to address these issues. The report then proposes the Bank's involvement in the financing&#13;
of the Brazil health sector reform program, and provides parameters for project&#13;
implementation.  An analysis of the Brazilian economy is included in the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995. The Government&#13;
has presented its health sector reform program in a Letter of Health Policy (Annex J).&#13;
2. HEALTH SECTOR BACKGROUND2  3&#13;
Recent Economic Trends and Future Prospects&#13;
2.1   In the recent past, Brazil has undergone major political and social transformations.&#13;
Democracy has been restored, the economy has become less statist, and significant&#13;
political power has been devolved to the states and municipalities. Brazil's private sector&#13;
has experienced high efficiency and productivity gains as the economy has been gradually&#13;
opened. The Brazilian authorities and the Bank concur that the central policy objective&#13;
over the medium term is the fight against poverty and inequity. Four sets of policy&#13;
initiatives are required to mount a sustained attack on poverty: stabilization and broad&#13;
based growth; reform of the roles of federal and state government; specific policies in the&#13;
areas of human capital formation, including education and health, infrastructure and&#13;
environment; and specific anti-poverty policies, including both rural and urban poverty&#13;

initiatives. This project would support the Government's implementation of specific&#13;
policies in the health sector.&#13;
Poverty and Social Expenditures4&#13;
2.2    Brazil's economic stagnation in the 1980s has left about 24 million Brazilians, 17.4&#13;
percent of the population, living below the poverty line in 1990. The level of poverty is&#13;
well above the average for a middle-income country and affects disproportionately the&#13;
population in the Northeast.&#13;
Figure 2.1: Brazil: Public Social Spending by  2.3    Social Spending has a critical&#13;

i.2 (1%)                    translated  into  a strong  position  on&#13;
social indicators or poverty alleviation.&#13;
The fact that social indicators are still so poor suggests serious inefficiencies in the&#13;
structure and delivery of social services.  Decentralizing the management of social&#13;
programs could make services better reflect the needs of beneficiaries and avoid the high&#13;
overheads associated with a centralized approach.&#13;
Population&#13;
2.4    According to the 1991 census, the Brazilian population numbers 146 million. The&#13;
average annual growth rate between 1980 and 1991 was 1.93 percent, a marked decline&#13;
from the rates of 2.5 and 2.9 percent registered during the 1970s and 1960s, respectively.&#13;
The total fertility rate declined from 4.9 in 1970 to 2.8 in 1992. Seventy-six percent of the&#13;
population is now urban. Between 1960 and 1991, the proportion of children aged 0-14&#13;
decreased from 43 percent to 34 percent, while the proportion of people aged 60 or more&#13;
increased from 4.7 to 6.1 percent. The nine largest metropolitan areas grew at a much&#13;
slower rate in the 1980s than in the earlier decade, but growth has picked up in the&#13;
country's medium-sized cities. As a result of the decline in fertility and mortality, the&#13;
elderly population in Brazil is growing rapidly. In the year 2000, it is estimated that 10&#13;
percent of the total population will be aged 60 or more.&#13;

Mortality and Morbidity&#13;

Births for Selected Countries - 1970 and 1993  years. From 1970 to 1993, life&#13;
expectancy grew  from  61 to&#13;
130                                       67 years and infant mortality&#13;
1101                                      declined from 95 to 42 deaths&#13;

___70 _ _    _     __                   Northeast, where the 1989 the&#13;
IMR was 92 per 1,000 live&#13;
births, and is worse than what could be expected for an upper middle income country such&#13;
as Brazil. Argentina, Chile, and even lower income countries such as Jamaica have more&#13;
favorable rates of decline of IMR than Brazil. Neonatal mortality remained stable during&#13;
the 1980s at approximately 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Although 83 percent of births&#13;
were attended by health staff in 1989, 47 percent of infant deaths were still due to&#13;
perinatal causes. In 1994, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 38.2 per 100,000&#13;
living births but reached 65.3 percent in poor regions.&#13;
2.6    The decline of child mortality and fertility will create new demands on the health&#13;
care system, such as the aging of the population, and bring to the fore costly non-&#13;
communicable diseases such as heart, cancer, and chronic pulmonary diseases. In 1991,&#13;
the primary causes of death in Brazil were: diseases of the circulatory system, 29.9&#13;
percent; external causes, 18 percent; ill-defined causes, 12.7 percent; and neoplasms&#13;
(cancer), 10.7 percent. Diseases of the circulatory system were already the leading cause&#13;
of death in all Brazilian regions.' Injuries from homicides and traffic accidents have&#13;
growing importance, each of the two causing more years of potential life lost than any&#13;
other single cause except malignant neoplasms. The problem is particularly serious among&#13;
adolescents, accounting for 55% and 74% of male deaths in the 10-14 and 15-19 age&#13;
groups, respectively. In the poor North and Northeast regions, the primary cause of death&#13;
were ill-defined since up to 50 percent of them are either not attended, or not properly&#13;
classified by a physician.&#13;
2.7    While chronic and degenerative diseases are now the leading causes of morbidity&#13;
and mortality for the entire population, communicable diseases remain a major risk for&#13;
the poor and the young, especially for those living in the North and the Northeast where&#13;
infectious and parasitic diseases rank third among the causes of reported deaths. Also,&#13;
although mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases has declined in the late 1980s and&#13;
early 1990s, the country is still experiencing epidemics of malaria, dengue, kalazar,&#13;
5Data on mortality and morbidity have to be interpreted with caution because: first, the proportion of the&#13;
deaths attributed to ill-defined conditions ranges from 9.1% in the Southeast to 43% in the&#13;
Northeast, and second, data on hospitalizations may be biased by the hospital payment system based&#13;
on diagnosis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

tuberculosis, and AIDS. Preventable intestinal infections, pneumonia, and nutritional&#13;
deficiencies accounted for 16.4, 11.4, and 4.6 percent of deaths, respectively.&#13;
2.8    Data on hospitalization  for 1984-1991  indicate that the leading cause of&#13;
adniissions was related to obstetric causes, or psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases, the&#13;
three accounting for 23 percent of all admissions and 20 percent of hospital costs in 1994.&#13;
Obstetric causes represented 10 percent of SUS reimbursements and psychiatric&#13;
admissions were the second largest reimbursement category, accounting for 6.4 percent of&#13;
all reimbursements.&#13;
Organization and Financing of Health Care6 and 7&#13;
2.9    Brazil's Unified Health System  (SUS), which is the sole source of publicly&#13;
financed care for 110 million Brazilians, is unique in Latin America and more comparable&#13;
to the model of Canada and several European countries. In the Constitution and in the&#13;
SUS law: (a) it is a single-payer system; (b) coverage is universal; (c) health benefits are&#13;
all-inclusive and free at the time of use; (d) financing comes mostly from general taxation&#13;
and subsidizes the poor; (e) funds are allocated to states and municipalities on the basis of&#13;
negotiated budgets, based on historical series; (f) most care is delivered by private&#13;
providers who compete for patients; (g) providers are reimbursed on the basis of&#13;
production (diagnosis-related groups); and (h) ownership and administration of public&#13;
services is partially decentralized to municipalities and states. Private health insurance&#13;
plays a significant complementary role for about 38 million people (26 percent of the&#13;
population). A detailed description of the system is provided in Annex K.&#13;
2.10   Coverage. Despite the impressive degree to which the SUS coincides with good&#13;
organizational and financial models, it has a number of significant shortcomings. Although&#13;
coverage is in theory universal, the system leaves large areas and groups uncovered in the&#13;
North and in periurban areas, where an estimated 10 million people do not have access to&#13;
health care. With 30 hospital beds and 14.2 physicians per 10,000 population, Brazil&#13;
compares favorably with the average for Latin America and other middle-income&#13;
countries. The country has a relative scarcity of nurses, with a 3.7 doctor/nurse ratio and&#13;
the distribution of health services and professionals in the various regions is very unequal,&#13;
being concentrated in the most developed regions and in state capitals. In the Northeast,&#13;
prenatal care coverage can be as low as 12 percent (e.g., the State of Piaui), and 31&#13;
percent of births still take place at home.&#13;
2.11   Benerits. The current constitutional mandate to pay for all health services for the&#13;
entire population is fiscally unsustainable: the present level of public health expenditures&#13;
(in 1994, US$93 per capita and 3 percent of GDP) is insufficient to pay for even a&#13;

moderately comprehensive health benefit package, even if only for the population which&#13;
relies exclusively on the SUS. The cheapest private health insurance and group medicine&#13;
systems, which offer limited benefits to relatively healthy populations, charge between&#13;
US$156 and US$131 per person covered per year, respectively. Rationing is achieved&#13;
through caps on admissions and budget ceilings.&#13;
2.12   Financing comes mostly from&#13;

- ,%           benefits. Funds are not earmarked for&#13;
these   various   programs.   SSB's&#13;
revenues originate from a mix of&#13;
social contributions and treasury revenues such as: (a) employee and employer social&#13;
security contributions; (b) tax on businesses' output - COFI`NS;8 (c) tax on businesses'&#13;
net profits - CSLP; and (d) other smaller sources (Social Integration Program - PIS&#13;
and Civil Servants Asset Creation Program - PASEP).&#13;
2.13   The private health insurance sector plays a significant complementary role in&#13;
financing health services. In 1994, 38 million people were covered by one of the several&#13;
schemes provided under private health insurance, which represents a US$6.6 billion&#13;
industry. In spite of the magnitude of the sector and its well known market failures, the&#13;
private health insurance system is mostly unregulated and practices both adverse selection&#13;
and selective disenrollment of high-risk patients; in addition, it is inequitable because&#13;
middle- and upper-class beneficiaries continue to use the SUS free-of-charge for costly&#13;
tertiary care.&#13;
2.14   Allocation of Resources. The allocation of recurrent and capital budgets is often&#13;
not transparent and does not promote equity. Public funds for investment in rehabilitation&#13;
and equipment were supposed to be transferred automatically to states as a proportion of&#13;
their recurrent budgets.  In reality they have been mostly allocated on the basis of&#13;
individual agreements between the Minister of Health and State Governors or Municipal&#13;
Mayors.&#13;
2.15   Delivery of Health Care.  Most care is delivered by private providers who&#13;
compete for patients. The provision of public health services is organized under the&#13;
Unified Health System (SUS) which integrates the public health network with the private&#13;
philanthropic and for-profit networks from which the Government purchases public health&#13;
services. These services represent about 70 percent of total health services provided in&#13;
8The collection of these contributions has been very inefficient. IPEA estimates that, in 1992, the level of&#13;
evasion to the COFINS contribution was around 76 percent. The end of the hyperinflation period led&#13;
to a sharp improvement in the collection of COFINS and CSLP contributions, but not in the revenues&#13;
from payroll deductions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Brazil. The balance of 30 percent is supplied by the private for-profit network that does&#13;
not contract with the Government and serves patients who are privately insured or pay out&#13;
of pocket. Patients are free to choose between public and private providers contracted by&#13;
the SUS. The private sector plays an important role in the providing services to SUS. In&#13;
1994, it accounted for 79 percent of hospital beds in the SUS, 83 percent of publicly&#13;
funded hospital admissions, and 87 percent of hospital reimbursements. The private sector&#13;
also accounted for 43 percent of publicly-funded ambulatory procedures and 73 percent of&#13;
all ambulatory reimbursements.&#13;
2.16   The quality of care is not well documented, but is judged to be low. Maternal care&#13;
is often used in health services administration as a "tracer" for quality of care. If judged&#13;
by maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, quality of care is likely to be very bad.&#13;
Although 83 percent of births were officially attended by qualified staff in 1989, maternal&#13;
mortality amd perinatal mortality are 45 percent higher than one would expect in a country&#13;
with the income and education of Brazil, suggesting very poor obstetric practice.&#13;
2.17 Administration of Public Health Services. The Ministry of Health has few&#13;
responsibilities in direct health care provision, as ownership and administration of public&#13;
services have been decentralized to municipalities and states since 1988. Starting in 1982,&#13;
successive administrations have decentralized both responsibilities and resources to&#13;
municipalities and, to a lesser degree, to states. At present, about 2,000 of the 5,000&#13;
Brazilian municipalities have some degree of autonomy in health care. Decentralization&#13;
has mostly benefited municipalities, leaving State Health Secretariats with a relatively&#13;
small and ill-defined role, lying between a strong Federal MoH and the municipal health&#13;
secretariats, over which they have no hierarchical authority, the latter tending to relate&#13;
directly to the Federal level. Municipal Health Secretariats are responsible for planning,&#13;
organizing, and managing public health care delivery in their jurisdiction, and can contract&#13;
private providers to deliver the care not provided by the public network. When necessary,&#13;
they can also form intermunicipal consortia9 to pool resources and better manage patient&#13;
flows.  Larger and better-managed municipalities with advanced administrative and&#13;
financial autonomy receive block grants which they are free to manage. It is anticipated&#13;
that some states will have full autonomy, meaning that in addition to receiving the block&#13;
grants, they will be entrusted with the responsibility for general public health functions&#13;
such as communicable disease control.&#13;
2.18   Provider Reimbursement. Providers are reimbursed on the basis of production&#13;
(diagnosis-related groups): SIHs for hospitalizations and SIAs for ambulatory care.&#13;
Current reimbursement rates are far out-of-line with the average costs of service, causing&#13;
lack of investments and maintenance of facilities, shortages in essential inputs, and leading&#13;
to poor quality of care and to fraud. Between 1991 and 1992, the average price of an SIH&#13;
9 An intermunicipal consortium is an innovative idea that consists of regrouping several municipalities&#13;
to create a critical mass of health care facilities embodying, for example, one tertiary-level university&#13;
hospital, 2-3 secondary or regional hospitals, and several health centers and posts. The main advantages&#13;
of consortium are that: (i) it achieves economies of scale through the joint purchase of some key inputs;&#13;
(ii) it can organize a meaningful reference system; and (iii) it improves the efficiency of the system by&#13;
separating the financing (by the consortium) from the delivery of services (by individual facilities that&#13;
would sell services to the consortium), and allowing the Federal and State levels to deal with a limited&#13;
number of entities (the consortia) rather than a multitude of municipalities or individual facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
fell from US$306 to US$180. A recent study estimates that reimbursements cover no&#13;
more than 40 to 50 percent of real costs (Table 2.1). Furthermore, the deterioration of&#13;
prices has been uneven across procedures and diagnosis.  This distortion affects the&#13;
reimbursement of essential clinical and public health services, while less cost-effective&#13;
tertiary care has been relatively more protected. In addition, it provides a perverse cross-&#13;
subsidy  since the upper and the upper middle class use  costly  tertiary  care&#13;
disproportionately.&#13;

2.19   The deterioration of prices has led hospitals and other providers to postpone&#13;
investments in rehabilitation and equipment, cut maintenance, close entire units, or go out&#13;
of business altogether, leaving the poor without recourse. In addition, many investment&#13;
projects were left unfinished, which if not completed will deteriorate and their sunken&#13;
costs lost. It has also led to widespread fraud by requesting illegal co-payments from&#13;
patients, tinkering fraudulently with patient diagnosis to maximize reimbursement,&#13;
requesting more than one reimbursement for each admission and falsifying admissions.&#13;
2.20   Regulation.  Although the Ministry of Health is responsible for policy and&#13;
standards, it has been unable to adequately regulate the system, namely to ensure the&#13;
quality of services it purchases, and to control fraud. Though the Government has a good&#13;
information system to detect fraud, it has been unable to enforce the law, due to the&#13;
possiblity of massive closings and service disruption. Conversely, the MoH still executes&#13;
too many vertical programs which might be more appropriately managed at state and&#13;
municipal levels, including. (a) the National Health Foundation -- FUNASA (sanitation&#13;
and communicable disease control); (b) the Central Pharmaceutical Agency -- CEME&#13;
(procurement, production and control of pharmaceuticals) and (c) the National Institute of&#13;
Food and Nutrition -- INAM.&#13;
Health Care Expenditures&#13;
2.21   Public Health  Expenditures were about US$19.1 billion in 1990, which&#13;
represented US$95.6 per capita and 2.76 percent of the country's GDP. Such a level of&#13;
expenditure is much smaller than the amount spent by other upper middle-income&#13;
countries in the region.  Total health expenditures in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica,&#13;
Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela represent from 1.96 percent to 7.5 percent of GDP. Only&#13;
Venezuela allocates a smaller proportion of its GDP to public health expenditures than&#13;
Brazil. In part because of the low public health expenditure, Brazil ranks last among the&#13;
cited countries for life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, immunization, and&#13;
prenatal care coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.22   Public health budgets have been volatile. In 1989, the per capita public health&#13;
expenditure was about US$96 but it fell to a low of US$63 in 1992 when the federal&#13;
government's expenditures with social security benefits almost exhausted the funds which&#13;
had been allocated to health. The revenue drop made the system's management extremely&#13;
difficult. The 1992-1993 Social Security crisis led to the deactivation of many beds and to&#13;
a significant reduction in hospital and ambulatory care. In 1995, Federal public health&#13;
expenditures reached US$15 billion, the equivalent of US$103 per capita.&#13;
2.23  In    1994,   total   health&#13;
Figure 2.5.: Brazil: Health Expenditures  expenditures  were  about US$21.1&#13;
(US$ Billions) - 1994           billion, corresponding to a US$136 per&#13;
capita and a 4.4 percent of the&#13;
UP$6. (31.28t                 Brazilian's GDP.  The distribution of&#13;
softB-        the health expenditures between public&#13;
and private entities was divided as&#13;
follows: federal expenditures US$10.4&#13;
U(84.11(1.43%)                              billion, US$67 per capita; states and&#13;
Federal     municipalities US$4.1 billion, US$26&#13;
per capita; and private expenditures&#13;
US$6.6 billion, US$43 per capita. The&#13;
latter represented 30 percent of total&#13;
expenditures, a high share even when&#13;
compared with that of OECD's countries, in spite the fact that it only accounts for&#13;
expenditures with private health insurance, pre-paid, medical cooperatives, and company-&#13;
based health systems. It did not include the out-of-pocket expenditures with private&#13;
medical consultation, tests, pharmaceuticals or admissions. In 1989, such out-of-pocket&#13;
expenditures were estimated at US$2.9 billion. If they had been kept at the same level,&#13;
total health expenditures in 1994 would be estimated at US$23.2 billion, the equivalent of&#13;
4.9 percent of GDP.&#13;
2.24   State and Municipal Health Expenditures. States' net health care expenditures&#13;
as a proportion of GDP have declined substantially during the 1980s and beginning of the&#13;
1990s, dropping 15 percent between 1980 and 1990. During the same period and for the&#13;
same indicator, municipalities almost doubled their share, from 0.19 to 0.34 percent of the&#13;
GDP. From 1985 to 1990, the proportion of health sector funds directly managed by&#13;
states increased by 43 percent, while those managed directly by municipalities rose by 60&#13;
percent. At the beginning of the 1990s, municipal health expenditures were almost equal&#13;
to those of the states. The increased role of municipalities and the declining state&#13;
responsibilities were caused bv the new Brazilian Constitution which redistributed a&#13;
greater share of tax revenues o ,iunicipalities, and by the Collor administration's policy of&#13;
favoring municipalities over states in the allocation of funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1996 Federal Health Sector Budget Proposal&#13;
2.25  For 1996, the Ministry of Health has proposed a total budget of US$23 billion, a&#13;
62 percent increase over the 1995 budget allocation.  A total of 44 percent of the&#13;
requested increase would be spent in raising reimbursement rates of hospital and&#13;
ambulatory services and another 33 percent would be used to strengthen sanitation and&#13;
communicable disease control by the National Health Foundation.&#13;
Figure 2.6.: Ministry of Health Allocation  2.26  The proposed 1996 budget would&#13;
of Budget Increase - 1996     allocate US$12.5 billion (55 percent) to the&#13;
Others         National Health Fund, of which US$9&#13;

hospital and ambulatory care provided&#13;
_AIHIRCA   under  the  Unified  Health  System.&#13;
Personnel                4362%      Personnel and debt service constitute the&#13;
16 53%                             second largest budget category, accounting&#13;
for 21 percent of the total budget.&#13;
Personnel would take up 17 percent of the&#13;
proposed budget. The remaining budget&#13;
(24 percent) would be used to finance&#13;
federal health agencies: (a) 17 percent for the National Health Foundation (sanitation and&#13;
communicable disease control), (b) 5.4 percent for the Central Pharmaceutical Agency&#13;
(the centralized drug procurement agency); (c) 0.9 percent for the Oswaldo Cruz&#13;
Foundation (post-graduate education, research and development and vaccine production);&#13;
and (d) 0.16 percent for the National Institute of Food and Nutrition (nutrition&#13;
surveillance and food distribution among the poor).&#13;
2.27  The largest relative increase in the proposed 1996 MoH Budget would go to the&#13;
National Health Foundation (276 percent), mostly due to a twenty fold increase in the&#13;
funds allocated to basic sanitation. The MoH also proposed other increases as follows: (a)&#13;
177 percent for the Milk Program; (b) 169 percent for the Social Pioneers Hospital (the&#13;
Federal District Hospital); (c) 242 percent for Community Campaigns; (d) 217 percent for&#13;
the Rehabilitation and Re-equipment of the SUS network (including those under the&#13;
proposed project); (e) 193 percent for Control of Endemic Diseases (including a new&#13;
malaria control program); (f) 256 percent for other National Health Foundation programs;&#13;
and (g) 110 percent for other National Food and Nutrition programs. Except for the&#13;
direct funding of the Social Pioneers Hospital, all these proposed budget increases show&#13;
the Government commitment to increasing its role in health promotion and disease&#13;
prevention, which are traditional public goods.&#13;
2.28  The proposed budget increases for the National Health Foundation (FUNASA)&#13;
is questionable. The original weight of the National Health Foundation in the 1995 MoH&#13;
budget and the massive increase in resources for 1996 does not seem justified because (a)&#13;
most of communicable disease control activities could be carried out more efficiently by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
states and municipalities and (b) most of the increase will go to finance rural water and&#13;
sanitation projects, which would be better provided and managed at local level, by private&#13;
or municipal utility companies.&#13;
2.29  It is equally difficult to justify a federal agency such as Central Pharmaceutical&#13;
Agency -- CEME, and the large increase in the appropriation of funds for the centralized&#13;
purchase of drugs is also problematic because: (a) distribution of free drugs to everyone&#13;
in public health services is not a clear-cut public responsibility; in fact, the best example of&#13;
cost recovery in low- and middle-income countries has been on drugs; and (b) the&#13;
Brazilian drug central procurement agency (CEME) has a bad reputation in terms of&#13;
efficiency and capacity to control fraud.&#13;
2.30  Finally, the size of the MoH payroll needs to be studied. Although the proportion&#13;
of the MoH payroll (18 percent of the 1996 budget ) is small when compared with that of&#13;
other countries (it is normally around 60 percent), and in spite the fact that the proportion&#13;
in 1996 would be smaller than in 1995 (19 percent), it is hard to accept a 53 percent&#13;
increase from one year to another, when almost all health services are provided either by&#13;
the private sector or by municipal or state hospitals and ambulatory services. Such an&#13;
increase would be at odds with the stated policy of making the MoH a small agency, with&#13;
mostly normative, regulatory, and monitoring functions.&#13;
2.31   The role and size of FUNASA and CEME, and the size of payroll issues would not&#13;
be addressed directly by the project, for the sake of simplicity and implementability, but&#13;
would be pursued through broad parallel track policy dialogue. At appraisal the Bank&#13;
agreed with the Government on the general terms of reference for the relevant studies to&#13;
that effect. In addition the Government presented to the Bank a draft concept paper for a&#13;
project to decentralize communicable disease control, which would address the role and&#13;
size of FlUNASA under a decentralized SUS.&#13;
2.32   The increased allocation for the Milk Program can also be questioned on the basis&#13;
of studies which have shown that it has been often ill-targeted, inefficient and abused. The&#13;
project would not address the problem because: (a) it represents a relatively small part of&#13;
the budget; (b) it is somewhat peripheral to the focus of the project; and (c) it is in large&#13;
part outside the realm of the MoH (i.e. it is part of the Comunidade Solidaria Program,&#13;
coordinated at the Presidential level).&#13;
2.33   The 1996 MoH budget shows reduced allocations in some items, including: (a)&#13;
amortization of debt service (57 percent), (b) vaccine production (29 percent); and (c)&#13;
counterpart funds for projects closing in 1996 (i.e. Bank supported NE Basic Health I, NE&#13;
Endemic Disease Control and Amazon Basin Malaria Control projects). The reduced&#13;
contribution to vaccine production may represent a new policy towards an increased&#13;
reliance on private-sector production and on purchases in competitive intemational&#13;
markets.&#13;

3. HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT&#13;
POLICY&#13;
Major Health Sector Issues10 11&#13;
3.1   Despite the impressive degree to which the Brazilian health care systems coincides&#13;
with good organizational and financial models, it has a number of significant failings&#13;
described below. Some of these failings can be addressed in the short-term within the&#13;
current institutional arrangements, while others are structural and can only be fixed in the&#13;
medium term.&#13;
3.2    Short-term  Problems. The main short-term  problem is that reimbursement of&#13;
private providers is far out of line with the average cost of services, and the Government&#13;
has often significant arrears. On average reimbursement schedules only cover 40 to 50&#13;
percent of costs and the Government often pays providers with delays of three to six&#13;
months. Due to underfinancing, philanthropic hospitals, which are the backbone of the&#13;
SUS, have been closing entire units, going out of business or canceling their public service&#13;
contracts, while public hospitals are left decaying, without essential inputs and, leaving the&#13;
poor without recourse to proper health care. During the past six years, lack of funds for&#13;
investments has been endemic. As a result, many investment projects have remained&#13;
unfinished and maintenance of capital has been neglected. These projects, if not&#13;
completed, will deteriorate and their sunken costs will be lost. In addition, the present&#13;
reimbursement schedule overcompensates some non-cost-effective tertiary interventions&#13;
used by the rich, while it leaves more cost-effective essential public health and clinical&#13;
interventions seriously undercompensated.&#13;
3.3    Structural Problems. There are five structural problems in the SUS. First and&#13;
most important, the current constitutional mandate to pay for all health services for the&#13;
entire population is not fiscally sustainable. The present level of public health expenditures&#13;
(in 1994, US$93 per capita and 3 percent of GDP) is insufficient to pay for even a&#13;
moderately comprehensive health benefit package, such as can be found in other middle-&#13;
0 The World Bank: The Organization, delivery and financing of health care in Brazil: Agenda for the&#13;
90s ( Washington, DC: The World Bank Report No 12655-BR, 1994).&#13;
The World Bank: Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil (Washington: The World Bank, Report No&#13;
No 14569 BR, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
income countries, for the whole population or even for the 76 percent of the population&#13;
which rely exclusively on the SUS. Given the costs of the more modest private health&#13;
insurance benefit package, it would cost an estimated US$15 to 20 billion to offer such a&#13;
moderate benefit package to the 110 million people who depend on the public system for&#13;
health care.&#13;
3.4    Rationing is achieved by ceilings on services and budgets. The rich have been more&#13;
successful in breaking waiting lists and in harnessing the system's scarce resources, and&#13;
spite of tight budgets and restrictions to access, middle- and upper-class private insurance&#13;
beneficiaries continue to use the SUS free-of-charge for costly tertiary care.&#13;
Box H: Failings of the Health Care:System (SUS) Today            :.&#13;
Financing     Public fmiancing is low to. provide the typical middle income contry health benefit&#13;
package; financing is very unstable, varying by as much as 50 percent over very short&#13;
periods.&#13;
Public health services do not recover any costs; there:areM noco-payments, deductibles,&#13;
moderation. fees, or any charges for comfort services.&#13;
Individuals and enterpn'ses are allowed to deduct insurance costs from income for tax&#13;
purposes; employer provided insurance is not:treated as income and is not taxed.:&#13;
Public facilities ireat privately insured patients and do. not recover the costs.from the&#13;
respective insurers.&#13;
Prices paid to providers are too low to cover costs, maintenance, depreciation and'&#13;
innovation.&#13;
Prices are distorted and do not provide incentives to allocative efficiencyr, there are even&#13;
perverse incentives to produce services of low cost-effectiveness:.::&#13;
There is no coherent investment.policy, particularlytin iequent.&#13;
Federal transfers to: states aid municipalities do not take into consideration&#13;
epidemiological.profiles orAdifferencesjin income.&#13;
Competition   Public providers are at an :advantage because, in: addition toa receiving: payment: for&#13;
services provided, they receive exta budgets for salaries and other inputs.&#13;
Although, patients are free to choose among public and private providers, they do not&#13;
have access to any information on :quality twhich would.allow them to make a betterl&#13;
informed:choice.&#13;
Regulation    Private insurers are not regulated and use adverse selection.&#13;
Quality of care provided by the private: sector islnot monitored or controlled, evenwhenl l&#13;
it is paid by SUS.&#13;
Auditing and governance control for both private: and public providers is ineffective.&#13;
Autonomy:  Public health'services lack autonomy and are directly maged by municipal4and':state.l&#13;
governments.     :&#13;
Management  Public health services are short in   professional: adinimstration :and. adequate..&#13;
management systems, and lack incentives for iinternal efficiency.&#13;
Private hospitals under contract are also often poorly managed. ......&#13;
3.5    Second, chronic under-financing has led to deterioration of facilities, shortages in&#13;
essential inputs, and poor remuneration of professionals, leading to inefficiency, poor&#13;
quality of care, a demoralized work force and fraud. Since 1987, capital investments in&#13;
the health sector dropped by 37 percent. The quality and efficiency of health care delivery&#13;
is low, and results largely from the deteriorated condition of facilities, including buildings&#13;
and electromechanical equipment, medical equipment and support services. Hospitals are&#13;
generally more deteriorated than health centers and posts. A large part of their basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
equipment is in disrepair, including key equipment, such as: X-ray machines, anesthesia&#13;
carts, operating-room lighting, boilers, laundry, and kitchen appliances. Many hospitals&#13;
also suffer from deterioration of their physical plant, including plumbing, cooling, sanitary&#13;
systems, and air conditioning. These bottlenecks in turn produce reductions in productivity&#13;
(i.e., excessive lengths of stay and increased costs), and in the quality of care, and pose&#13;
safety hazards to both staff and patients (i.e. radiation leaks, hospital infections, etc.).&#13;
3.6   The Federal Government has been until recently unable to adequately regulate the&#13;
system, namely to ensure the quality of services it purchases, and to contro] fraud.&#13;
Despite the major role of the private sector in both health care delivery and financing,&#13;
regulation often does not exist or is poorly enforced. The quality of care is inadequate as&#13;
it can be judged by the hospital fatality rate, which has been increasing since 1991 to reach&#13;
the highest rate in ten years: 2.4 percent. In the area of fraud control, the record is equally&#13;
poor: the Government estimates that fraud is present in over 10 percent of all hospital&#13;
reimbursements, but other sources estimate that fraud may be present in as many as 40&#13;
percent of all reimbursements. Given the inadequate reimbursement rates and the need to&#13;
keep health care providers in business, the Government has had difficulty in controlling&#13;
fraud.&#13;
3.7   In addition and with few  exceptions, public sector and many philanthropic&#13;
hospitals are poorly managed, with: (a) inadequacy of inputs (i.e., human resources are&#13;
heavily physician-biased); (b) above-average market prices for equipment expenditures; (c)&#13;
widespread absenteeism reflected in low staff productivity; (d) low levels of hospital&#13;
management autonomy, (e) accountability problems (managers are commonly appointed&#13;
on the basis of political criteria); and (f) underdeveloped quality assurance programs.&#13;
3.8   Third, the system fails to cover the poor who have moved to new settlements in&#13;
the North and to peri-urban areas. Driven by market forces, health care providers tend to&#13;
concentrate their activities in the South and Southeast regions. Although this situation&#13;
improved in 1980s when the number of hospital beds and ambulatory services grew at a&#13;
faster rate in the North and Northeast than in the South and Southeast regions, the&#13;
population of the latter regions still use nearly twice as many ambulatory services (4&#13;
consultation per person per year) as do their compatriots who live in poorer Northeast and&#13;
North states (2-3 consultations per person per year). An estimated 10 million people,&#13;
formally covered by the SUS, currently do not have real access to health care because they&#13;
live in more remote areas. In addition, migration to large cities has created large peri-&#13;
urban settlements (e.g. Baixada Fluminense, in the outskirts of Rio) where the social&#13;
infrastructure is weak or nonexistent. The problem is worsened by the fact that recent&#13;
fiscal tightness and low reimbursement rates have led to a reduction in the number of the&#13;
publicly financed beds from 4.3 per thousand inhabitants in 1982 to 3.7 in 1992.&#13;
3.9   Fourth, reimbursement of providers constitutes only 40 percent of the MoH&#13;
budget, a very low proportion, if one considers that the Ministry has few health care&#13;
provision responsibilities. Federal agencies such as the National Health Foundation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
the Central Pharmaceutical Agency, which could be for the most part decentralized, still&#13;
consume 25 percent of the federal health budget resources. While the Constitution has&#13;
passed down significant responsibilities to small and unprepared municipalities, it has not&#13;
defined exactly the role of states, creating overlapping in the area of planning, and leaving&#13;
serious doubts on how the system would be financed and controlled.&#13;
3.10  Finally, medical unit costs have been expanding exponentially, at twice the rate of&#13;
the consumer price index, due to uncontrolled introduction of new technologies and&#13;
pharmaceuticals, often of doubtful cost-effectiveness. Between 1980 and 1993, the annual&#13;
health inflation index was on average 423%. From 1990 to 1994, the consumer price&#13;
index and the health inflation index increased twice and three times more than the adjusted&#13;
reimbursement rates, respectively.&#13;
3.11   All these failings can be corrected under the current institutional arrangements.&#13;
The Government is planning a 10-year health sector reform program, of which the present&#13;
project would be the first of a series of two or three consecutive projects, to repair the&#13;
described shortcomings while improving the desirable features. The project will deal with&#13;
a few of these problems, while others will be pursued through ongoing broad policy&#13;
dialogue, technical assistance and possibly through other complementary loans and&#13;
projects.&#13;
Government Health Sector Policy&#13;
3.12   The proposed REFORSUS project is the main vehicle for the Government's health&#13;
policy. The project would reinforce many of the positive features of the Brazilian Unified&#13;
Health System and eliminate some of its present shortcomings. This is the first time that&#13;
the Government of Brazil has requested Bank assistance for a policy-based sectoral&#13;
operation. It is the product of several years of dialogue, health policy and economic and&#13;
sector work (Annex L). As soon as the present Government took office in January 1995,&#13;
the Minister of Health sought Bank assistance to respond to a health care crisis:&#13;
reimbursement of health care providers was so out-of-line with the average cost of&#13;
services that philanthropic hospitals, which are the backbone of the public health system,&#13;
were closing entire units, going out of business or canceling their public service contracts&#13;
and public hospitals, which essentially serve the poor, were left to decay, without essential&#13;
inputs.&#13;
3.13   The ensuing dialogue led the Government to prepare the proposed project and to&#13;
take emergency health policy initiatives. In its first year in office, the Government has (a)&#13;
increased the provider reimbursement rates by 25 percent to keep philanthropic providers&#13;
from leaving the public system and meet the operating costs of public providers; (b)&#13;
created and operated a National Chamber of Health Care Price Negotiations to ensure&#13;
adequate compensation of health care providers; (c) prepared, with Bank assistance, a&#13;
limited list of most cost-effective interventions which will be fully reimbursed starting in&#13;
1996, to match the systems benefits with resource constraints; (d) introduced legislation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
which will allow cost recovery of care provided to privately- insured patients under the&#13;
SUS; (e) proposed a budget for 1996 which will allow raising reimbursement rates to a&#13;
level high enough to cover full costs of the most cost-effective interventions (described in&#13;
the so called Priority I list -- para 4.9 and Annex N), protecting the system from further&#13;
deterioration; (f) upgraded its management information system and instituted a National&#13;
Audit System, which has resulted in a 10 percent reduction of fraudulent claim; (g) started&#13;
using global health budgets (i.e. overall ceilings) for states and municipalities to improve&#13;
control over expenditures; and (h) provided advanced administrative autonomy to 4 states&#13;
and 83 municipalities, allowing them to receive block grants and to directly manage the&#13;
financing of the sector.  In addition,  the Government has submitted legislation to&#13;
Congress which will further increase decentralization to states and municipalities. These&#13;
critical reform initiatives, discussed with the Government during project identification and&#13;
preparation, have started to be implemented much faster that anticipated.&#13;
3.14 In the medium term, these measures need to be strengthened and complemented.&#13;
The Government is planning a I 0-year health sector reform program, of which the present&#13;
project would be the first of a series of two or three consecutive projects, to address the&#13;
described shortcomings and improve, when feasible, the overall features of the system. At&#13;
negotiations, the Government will present a Letter of Health Policy which describes&#13;
reforms undertaken to date and a vision of where the Government would like the Unified&#13;
Health System to be in 1998 (Annex J). The project would finance the necessary&#13;
technical assistance and management information system to that effect. In addition, a&#13;
parallel track of broad policy dialogue will be continued with the Government on&#13;
important issues which would not be tackled by the project, for the sake of simplicity and&#13;
implementability.&#13;
3.15  If the SUS reform program is implemented, by the year 2000: (a) coverage would&#13;
continue to be universal, but; (b) the scope of health benefits financed under the SUS&#13;
would be compatible with health sector revenues, and would favor more cost-effective&#13;
interventions at the expense of less cost-effective interventions; (c) financing would&#13;
continue to come mostly from taxation and subsidize the poor, but states and&#13;
municipalities would take more responsibility, private insurers would be called to pay for&#13;
services provided to their beneficiaries under the SUS; (d) the allocation of capital and&#13;
recurrent health care budgets to states and municipalities would be mostly automatic and&#13;
based on transparent and equity generating formulas, which would include income, health&#13;
and supply indicators; (e) private providers would continue to be the backbone of public&#13;
health care provision, but would be more accountable for the quality of services provided;&#13;
(f) public hospitals and ambulatory services would be given administrative and financial&#13;
autonomy; (g) reimbursements would be enough to maintain capital, and be used as&#13;
incentives to promote cost-effective interventions and discourage use of public resources&#13;
for less cost-effective ones; and (h) the Ministry of Health would keep the core of policy&#13;
setting, regulation and financing, while shedding non-essential functions. If these policy&#13;
reforms were implemented, the SUS would evolve toward more efficient, equitable and&#13;
higher-quality medical care. To reach these objectives requires reform in three distinct&#13;
areas: prices for services, management capacity, and investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3.16  MoH policy is coordinated with that of the Ministries of Planning and Finance&#13;
through an ad hoc committee created in 1994. The Committee has met regularly and, in&#13;
July 1994, produced a report with a series of recommendations most of which are part of&#13;
the present Government's agenda and would be incorporated in the Project. The Ministry&#13;
is also coordinating with the Ministry of the Federal Administration and Reform of the&#13;
State -- MARE, regarding the administrative reform and how it could contribute to a more&#13;
autonomous and efficient administration of public hospitals.&#13;
4. PROJECT CONCEPT AND COMPOSITION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
4.1   The project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the delivery of care under the&#13;
SUS, which is the sole source of publicly subsidized care for the poor, and (b) assist the&#13;
Government in introducing policy reforms which would improve the financial sustainability&#13;
and efficiency of the SUS.&#13;
4.2   To improve the delivery of care, the project would set an investment fund to&#13;
support rehabilitation, equipment, and management systems for SUS hospitals and&#13;
ambulatory network. The project would improve the technical and management&#13;
infrastructure in I 1 percent of the network.&#13;
4.3   To improve the financial sustainability and efficiency of the SUS, the project would&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the MoH, the states, and municipalities in their role of health&#13;
care purchasers, and assist the Government in preparing and implementing the necessary&#13;
health sector finance reforms to: (a) ensure adequate compensation for health care&#13;
providers, by establishing reimbursements rates which would be enough to maintain and&#13;
replace capital; (b) protect the system from further deterioration of assets, by deciding on&#13;
priority investments and necessary reimbursement levels on the basis of annual reviews of&#13;
budget resources available for the SUS; (c) reduce revenue constraints by establishing cost&#13;
recovery, and selecting a number of more cost-effective interventions to be financed under&#13;
the SUS; (d) reduce fraud, by establishing systematic audit and improving the&#13;
reimbursement management information system; and (e) control federal expenditures by&#13;
adopting global health budget transfers to states and municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Components and Activities&#13;
4.4    The project would finance the following two components.&#13;
4.5    Component I -  Investment Fund for the rehabilitation, equipment and&#13;
improved management of the Unified Health System (SUS) in order to improve its health&#13;
care delivery (US$ 690 million equivalent, 92 percent of total project costs). The project&#13;
would finance rehabilitation, equipment and management subprojects, to conclude&#13;
unfinished projects, to arrest the deterioration of the infrastructure and to recover the&#13;
technological deficit caused by years of underfinancing, poor management and lack of&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
4.6   Investments would give priority to subprojects supporting the provision of more&#13;
cost-effective interventions. The project would not finance new construction except in&#13;
new settlements where there are no facilities, either public or private or when it is matched&#13;
by a parallel reduction of capacity at other sites. Equipment purchases would be justified&#13;
on the basis of. (i) restoring the system's capacity; (ii) putting idle complementary&#13;
resources back into use; or (iii) reducing the cost of an intervention already being&#13;
provided. It is estimated that 55 percent of project resources would be used in the&#13;
rehabilitation of ambulatory care facilities and 45 percent in restoring the capacity of&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
4.7    The funding of rehabilitation and equipment subprojects would be subject to the&#13;
establishment of performance contracts and the satisfactory implementation of&#13;
management development: (a) cost accounting, (b) billing, and cost recovery for care&#13;
provided to privately insured patients under the SUS, (c) standards for maternal care and&#13;
control of hospital infections, and (d) safe handling of hazardous wastes and materials.&#13;
Funds would be released in two phases: first, up to 40 percent of the total costs would be&#13;
made available upon contract signing; second, the remaining funds would be available&#13;
depending on the satisfactory implementation of the described package of management&#13;
and maintenance reforms.&#13;
4.8   The project would finance subprojects proposed on a competitive basis by public&#13;
and philanthropic health care providers, including states, intermunicipal consortia and&#13;
municipalities. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would receive a series of competitive&#13;
proposals by region and type of subproject. Funds unused by a region would be&#13;
reallocated to another region. This would put regions in competition for funds and would&#13;
stimulate efficiency in implementation. State Health Secretariats, municipalities, inter-&#13;
municipal consortia, and philanthropic health care providers would prepare and present&#13;
subproject proposals. To ensure that more developed regions do not take up all available&#13;
funds, the Borrower agreed to an estimate of funds required by region on the basis&#13;
population and relative need (Annex 0). States and municipalities with poor capacity&#13;
presenting fewer subprojects than what would be expected from their social and health&#13;
indicators, would receive technical assistance to prepare subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
4.9    Component II -  Institutional Development to improve health care financing&#13;
and management (US$60 million equivalent).  The project would finance technical&#13;
assistance, including consulting services, and epidemiological, economic, managerial,&#13;
legal and other studies, necessary to reform health care financing and ensure the financial&#13;
sustainability of the system. It would also support consensus-building and dissemination of&#13;
activities such as publications, workshops and seminars, study visits, and training. This&#13;
component would support the establishment of&#13;
(a)   an adequate framework for pricing and reimbursing health care providers,&#13;
including a system to monitor the costs of health care on a continuous basis, and the&#13;
operation of a permanent Chamber of Health Care Prices for regularly negotiating the&#13;
prices charged for health care;&#13;
(b)   a list of priority health benefits to be financed by the SUS. The project&#13;
would finance burden of disease and cost-effectiveness studies to support the definition or&#13;
the list of priority health benefits;&#13;
(c)   linked to the above, a differentiated reimbursement schedule favoring more&#13;
cost-effective interventions;&#13;
(d)   introduction of cost recovery for care provided to privately-insured&#13;
patients under the SUS; and&#13;
(e)    better management of the quality of services and fraud control, including&#13;
the decentralization of the National Audit System to state and municipal levels; issuing&#13;
bills in public and private hospitals financed under the project, to improve user information&#13;
and control over what is being charged to the SUS; upgrading of the management&#13;
information system for reimbursements; and the establishment and diffusion of quality of&#13;
care standards for maternal care, hospital infection control, and safe collection and&#13;
disposal of hazardous medical wastes and materials.&#13;
4.10  The present list of publicly funded public health and clinical interventions would be&#13;
divided into three parts according the magnitude and social value of the health problem&#13;
which they address, and their cost effectiveness. Priority 1 interventions include a set of&#13;
highly cost-effective interventions which address important sources of the burden of&#13;
disease, accounting for about 30 percent of output (Annex N); Priority 2 interventions&#13;
would include a group of moderately cost-effective interventions, accounting for 40 to 50&#13;
percent of output; and Priority 3 interventions would account for the remainder.&#13;
Reimbursement of interventions would be differentiated between the three groups: (a)&#13;
reimbursement of Priority I interventions would cover full operational, maintenance and&#13;
capital costs; reimbursement of Priority 2 interventions would cover 75 to 85 percent of&#13;
costs, depending on the availability of resources, and Priority 3 interventions would be&#13;
reimbursed at 50 percent of costs. The system would would make benefits match public&#13;
resources available for the system by shifting interventions between Priority 1 and 2, and&#13;
between Priority 2 and 3, as well as by adjusting the reimbursement rates for Priority 2 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3 interventions. In addition, the proposed system would improve the efficiency of public&#13;
health resource allocation, by increasing the proportion of public funds which are used in&#13;
more cost-effective interventions.&#13;
4.11   The loan would be linked to the reform program through: (a) the Government&#13;
adopting reform initiatives before negotiations (Annex I); (b) the Bank conditioning&#13;
commitments for new subprojects to the adoption by the MoH of reforms no later that&#13;
November 30, 1997 and November 30, 1998 (Annex I); and (c) yearly agreements on the&#13;
financial requirements of SUS and on the satisfactory execution of the previous year's&#13;
SUS budget.&#13;
5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
5.1   Total project cost is estimated at US$750 million equivalent, net of taxes and&#13;
duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$250 million equivalent (33 percent).&#13;
Funds would be committed over three years and disbursed over four years. Of the total&#13;
financing of US$750 million equivalent, the Bank would finance US$300 million&#13;
equivalent (46 percent of foreign exchange costs and 37 percent of local costs), the IDB&#13;
would finance US$350 million equivalent, and the beneficiaries would finance US$100&#13;
million equivalent. A breakdown of the project's costs is shown in Annex A and is&#13;
summarized below.&#13;

5.2   Price contigencies are estimated at US$50 million equivalent.  No physical&#13;
contingencies are provided, since the project is demand driven, if unit costs are higher than&#13;
expected, the volume of subprojects approved would be reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
5.3   The cost estimates and average size of each subproject reflect a consensus of&#13;
sector specialists and the experience accumulated by the Government during its survey of&#13;
state and municipal health sector rehabilitation needs. The project is expected to finance&#13;
about 1,500 sub-projects over five years in 26 states, i.e. 300 sub-projects per year. This&#13;
value is realistic when compared with the capacity of the MoH, the state health&#13;
secretariats and the Banco do Brasil. The miscellaneous administrative costs, consulting&#13;
services (including supervision, audits and ex post evaluations) and maintenance of&#13;
equipment purchased with the proceeds of the Loan, are based on the average cost of&#13;
technical assistance provided by UN agencies and on prevailing market costs of&#13;
consultants and training services in Brazil.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
5.4   The proposed Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent would represent 40 percent&#13;
of total project costs. Local beneficiaries, including municipal and state public health&#13;
agencies, philanthropic health care providers and community-based organizations, would&#13;
contribute US$100 million (15 percent of total project costs).&#13;

5.5   The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) would finance the project in parallel&#13;
with the Bank, with a loan of US$350 million equivalent, which would represent another&#13;
47 percent of total project cost. The Government would propose subprojects to be&#13;
financed by each institution, but would ensure that disbursements occur in parallel, so that&#13;
at any point in time the proportion of funds disbursed by each co-financier would not vary&#13;
by more than 10 percent. Joint project identification, preparation, and supervision would&#13;
ensure efficient inter-lender coordination.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
6. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS,&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Project Management and Coordination&#13;
6.1   The  project would be coordinated by MoH, which would establish a PCU,&#13;
including three regional offices. MoH would enter into an agreement with the National&#13;
Bank for Economic and Social Development -- BNDES, and also with the Banco do&#13;
Brasil -- BB, which would manage all contracts and financial transactions with the&#13;
beneficiaries and the Bank. BNDES would manage contracts valued at US$3 million or&#13;
more, and BB would manage contracts valued at less than US$3 million.&#13;
6.2   The PCU would: (a) ensure the project's management, including maintaining&#13;
project records and preparing regular implementation reports; (b) maintain a data base of&#13;
standard unit costs for civil works, equipment, and consultants; (c) contract financial and&#13;
procurement audits and ex post evaluation; (d) appraise large projects -- i.e. estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$750,000 for works and US$350,000 for goods; (e) supervise regional&#13;
offices (which would: inform potential beneficiaries of project eligibility and evaluation&#13;
criteria; provide or contract technical assistance for subproject preparation; prepare&#13;
subproject appraisal reports; monitor or contract the supervision of subproject&#13;
implementation; as well as maintain adequate records on the respective subprojects); and&#13;
(f) execute the Institutional Development component.&#13;
6.3   States, municipalities and philanthropic providers would present subprojects to the&#13;
existing State Bipartite Management Committees, which are chaired by State Secretaries&#13;
of Health and include representatives of the Municipal Health Secretaries. About 70&#13;
percent of subprojects would be approved by the states, based on eligibility and evaluation&#13;
criteria acceptable to the Bank and set out in the Operational Manual (para. 6.1 1). Large&#13;
subprojects would be approved by the existing National Tripartite Management&#13;
Committee chaired by the Minister of Health and including representatives of the State&#13;
and Municipal Health Secretaries. In the case of states with advanced autonomy, the State&#13;
Bipartite Committee would approve all subprojects, including the large projects. The Bank&#13;
would review proposals with civil works estimated to cost more than US$3 million&#13;
equivalent, and those which include equipment estimated to cost more than US$350,000&#13;
or technical assistance in excess of US$100,000. The PCU would respond directly to the&#13;
Minister of Health, and would provide technical assistance to the States and to the&#13;
Tripartite Committee for the evaluation of subprojects. The PCU will have a federal office&#13;
and six regional units. BNDES and BB would act as the financial agents of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
6.4   Eligibility and evaluation criteria include: (a) type of sponsor (e.g., municipality,&#13;
state, non-profit organization); (b) type of facility (e.g., maternity, general hospital,&#13;
ambulatory care center, etc.); (c) type of investment (e.g., works, equipment, management&#13;
development, etc.); (d) consistency with the respective state or municipal health sector&#13;
priorities and development plans; (e) maximum and minimum subproject size; (f) impact&#13;
on recurrent costs; (g) expected benefits; (h) management arrangements; (i) schedule of&#13;
activities; () risks and mitigation actions; (k) environmental plan; and (1) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. Criteria for selecting the first two subproject selection rounds would be&#13;
simplified.&#13;
6.5   Priority would be given to subprojects which would help provide more cost-&#13;
effective clinical interventions and public health services, including maternal and infant&#13;
care, trauma and emergency care, family health, blood banks, public health laboratories,&#13;
unfinished health facilities, and management development. As provided in the Operational&#13;
Manual, until an adequate system is set in place for managing the introduction and&#13;
diffusion of high medical technology in the SUS, the following equipment would not be&#13;
financed by the project: magnetic resonance, positron emission tomography. lithotripsy,&#13;
nuclear medicine devices, extracorporal circulation devices, linear accelerators and cobalt&#13;
radiation devices, and neonatal intensive care units.&#13;
6.6   All municipalities would be eligible for receiving technical assistance.  Only&#13;
municipalities with at least minimal autonomy (i.e., for ambulatory care management)&#13;
would have access to rehabilitation and equipment funds. States and municipalities with&#13;
advanced autonomy (i.e. receiving health sector block grants) would be given an&#13;
investment budget ceiling and would approve all subprojects at state level.&#13;
6.7   BNDES and BB would be responsible for carrying out all financial transactions&#13;
with the beneficiaries and the Bank.  They would directly contract and supervise&#13;
subproject implementation. After a subproject is approved, BNDES or BB would sign an&#13;
execution contract with the subproject sponsor and ensure adequate financial&#13;
management. According to the contract, BNDES or BB would advance funds to cover&#13;
subproject start-up and to finance subproject preparation costs retroactively (i.e., up to 10&#13;
percent of total sub-project costs). Subsequent payments would be made on the basis of&#13;
(a) statement of expenditures, (b) satisfactory implementation of core management&#13;
systems and two optional management systems, and (c) project supervision reports. The&#13;
PCU would provide or contract technical assistance to help the beneficiaries organize&#13;
national competitive bidding and would be responsible for international competitive&#13;
bidding.&#13;
6.8   The PCU would contract independent firms to regularly carry out: (a) financial&#13;
and procurement audits of a sample of subprojects, and (b) ex-post economic and&#13;
beneficiary evaluation of a sample of subprojects, under terms of reference to be agreed&#13;
with the Bank. Draft terms of reference are presented in Annex G.&#13;
6.9   The proceeds of the loan would be passed on to beneficiaries as grants, linked to&#13;
management contracts and output indicators. For example, a municipality receiving a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
grant to improve a maternity would sign a management agreement by which it would&#13;
commit to raise the rate of assisted deliveries by a certain percentage.&#13;
6.10  Local beneficiaries would contribute an average of 15 percent of total subproject&#13;
costs. For subprojects estimated to cost less than US$1 million equivalent, beneficiaries&#13;
will have to contribute with at least 10 percent of total project costs. For projects costing&#13;
US$1 million equivalent, but less than US$5 million, beneficiaries would contribute at&#13;
least 15 percent of total project costs.  Finally, for projects costing US$5 million&#13;
equivalent or more, beneficiaries would contribute at least 20 percent of total project&#13;
costs.&#13;
6.11   At appraisal, the Government presented an Operational Manual acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, including the criteria and procedures for subproject identification, preparation and&#13;
appraisal, cofinancing and implementation arrangements, and project performance&#13;
indicators.  In addition, it presented project implementation and procurement plans&#13;
covering the first year of project implementation, acceptable to the Bank. At negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that the Borrower would. (a) maintain a Project Director and&#13;
Line Managers with experience and qualifications acceptable to the Bank; and (b) seek&#13;
approval from the Bank before making any significant change in the Operational Manual.&#13;
First Year Project Implementation Plan&#13;
6.12  The first year implementation plan consists of a plan of activities related to a series&#13;
of call for proposals, because the project will operate as an investment fund and will&#13;
finance subprojects proposed by states, municipalities and philanthropic providers on a&#13;
competitive basis. The main areas would be: (a) blood bank network; (b) public health&#13;
laboratories; (c) conclusion of unfinished state hospitals and ambulatory facilities; (d)&#13;
rehabilitation and equipment of the philanthropical hospitals and ambulatory facilities; and&#13;
(e) rehabilitation and equipment of municipal hospitals and ambulatory facilities. The plan&#13;
is described in detail in Annex F. Specific subproject plans will only be available after&#13;
Bipartite and Tripartite Management Committees approve them. The terms of reference&#13;
of major specific studies to be carried out under the Institutional Development component&#13;
have been agreed at appraisal and are described in detail in Annex G.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
6.13  Procurement of works, goods and services, as well as the contracting of&#13;
consultants with Bank funds, would be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (January 1995) and the Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants (August 1981). To facilitate administrative procedures, IDB and other&#13;
co-financiers have accepted procurement procedures and documents proposed by the&#13;
Bank, thereby simplifying for the Government its procurement duties and responsibilities.&#13;
6.14  Most procurement would be carried out by states or municipalities, community&#13;
organizations, and non-profit providers following Bank's procedures. For contracts to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
awarded following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents agreed between the Bank and the International Affairs Secretariat of the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Budget (SEAIN) would be used. As a condition of negotiations,&#13;
the project would present sample bidding documents for NCB for procurement of goods&#13;
and civil works acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
6.15  The PCU will include a full-time procurement officer whose main responsibilities&#13;
will be to: (a) submit to the Bank all procurement documents which, according to the&#13;
provision of the loan agreement, require Bank's prior review, once him/herself have&#13;
performed the first stage review; (b) carry out procurement at the central (PCU) level; (c)&#13;
coordinate and monitor procurement carried out by each executing unit; and (d) prepare&#13;
and submit to the Bank at the beginning of each calendar year a detailed procurement&#13;
schedule.  The appointment of the procurement officer would be done in consultation&#13;
with the Bank. At project launch, a procurement workshop will be delivered by the Bank&#13;
to present and explain procurement guidelines, to commence preparing specific bidding&#13;
documents, and ensure that the initial arrangements for contracting goods, civil works and&#13;
services are properly carried out. At central level, the Project Management Unit (PCU)&#13;
would only procure: (a) some office and equipment rehabilitation for the PCU and the&#13;
planned health policy units; and (b) would carry out all International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB) during the first year of implementation for large medical equipment or supply&#13;
contracts. Gradually, the executing agencies may undertake ICB procurement, once the&#13;
Bank and the PCU have satisfied themselves that they have developed the capacity to&#13;
effectively perform  the task in accordance with Bank's guidelines.  Procurement&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 6.1.&#13;
6.16  Civil Works. The project would finance the rehabilitation and refurbishing of&#13;
existing health posts, centers, and hospitals. No new civil works are expected to be&#13;
constructed under the project. It is estimated that about US$320 million equivalent of the&#13;
project's cost will be allocated to civil works.  Contracts for civil works would be&#13;
awarded as follows:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB), for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$5,000,000 equivalent or more. Applicants for civil works valued at more than US$10&#13;
million would be prequalified. It is estimated that only about 5 percent of the contracts in&#13;
this category, accounting for about 22 percent of funds allocated to civil works or an&#13;
amount of US$70.0 million equivalent, would be carried out through ICB;&#13;
(b)   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$350,000 or more, but less than US$5,000,000 equivalent, without restriction of&#13;
foreign participation, and up to an aggregate amount of US$210.0 million equivalent.&#13;
Simplified NCB documents would be used for contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$750,000 (bidding documents agreed with SEAIN for small contracts). It is estimated&#13;
that subprojects in this category would account for 78 percent of funds allocated to civil&#13;
works; and&#13;
(c)   Civil works estimated to cost less than US$350,000, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$40 million equivalent, would be awarded on the basis of fixed-term lump-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
sum contracts by comparison of at least three quotations from qualified contractors. The&#13;
contracting of these works would be made by each executing unit (or subproject) with the&#13;
approval and review of the PCU. It is estimated that subprojects in this category would&#13;
account for about 12 percent of funds allocated to civil works.&#13;

6.17   Goods. The project would finance medical and office equipment and supplies,&#13;
computer hardware and software supplies; and vehicles (i.e. ambulances) for a total&#13;
amount estimated at US$290.0 million equivalent, procured as follows:&#13;
(a)    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$350,000 equivalent or more; to the extent possible goods or equipment will be&#13;
combined in packages valued at US$350,000 equivalent or more and be procured centrally&#13;
through  ICB.   It is estimated that about US$200.0  million equivalent of goods&#13;
representing 69 percent of the total funds will be procured through ICB.&#13;
(b)    Limited International Bidding (LIB) would be applied to the procurement&#13;
of very specialized medical equipment for which there is a limited number of suppliers.&#13;
Contracts to be awarded under this modality would not exceed US$1.6 million per&#13;
package and US$18.0 million in the aggregate. It is estimated that subprojects in this&#13;
category would account for 6 percent of funds allocated to goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
(c)   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or more, but less than US$350,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$55.0 million equivalent; such goods and equipment would be procured at&#13;
the state or municipal level. It is estimated that subprojects in this category would account&#13;
for about 19 percent of funds allocated to goods; and&#13;
(d)   National Shopping for contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$17.0 million equivalent. Such contracts&#13;
would be procured locally by the subproject executor. It is estimated that subproject&#13;
under this category would account for 6 percent of finds allocated to goods.&#13;
6.18  Technical Assistance.  The project would finance individual consultants and&#13;
consulting firms to carry out technical assistance, training, studies, dissemination activities,&#13;
monitoring and supervision, and auditing and evaluation services. Consultants would be&#13;
selected and contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines (August 1981). A standard&#13;
invitation package, including letter of invitation, standard terms of reference format, and&#13;
the Bank's time-based assignments or lump-sum assignments contract forms will be&#13;
agreed with the PCU and passed on to the executing agencies. Contracts estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$100,000 equivalent with firms or US$50,000 equivalent with individuals&#13;
would be formalized on the basis of standard terms of reference and contract forms&#13;
previously agreed with the Bank. Any taxes paid by consultants would be excluded from&#13;
Bank financing.&#13;
6.19 Prior Review by the Bank. The Bank would review:&#13;
(a)   Contracts for works of US$3,000,000 or more;&#13;
(b)   Contracts for goods of US$350,000 or more, and those submitted to&#13;
Limited International Bidding;&#13;
(c)   All terms of reference, shortlists, and contracts for consulting firms of&#13;
US$100,00 or more;&#13;
(d)   All terms of reference, shortlists, and contracts for individual consultants of&#13;
US$50,000 or more, in aggregate during the calendar year;&#13;
(e)   Contracts for the PMU general manager and Regional PMU managers and&#13;
the Project's Procurement Officer;&#13;
(f)    The first subproject in every category; and&#13;
(g)   Annual Procurement Schedule.&#13;
6.20  Based on the subprojects to be financed in the first year of project implementation,&#13;
it is estimated that the Bank will review about 35 contracts per year; representing 5&#13;
percent of the total number of contracts for civil works but covering 58 percent of funds&#13;
allocated to that category; and 14 percent of the contracts for goods and covering about&#13;
83 percent of total funds for the corresponding category. In addition, MoH would retain&#13;
the services of a financial and procurement auditor satisfactory to the Bank, to prepare&#13;
financial and procurement audits at least every six months, on the basis of appropriate&#13;
samples of procurement documentation. Audit reports would be sent to the Bank no later&#13;
than six months after their completion date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
6.21   At appraisal the Borrower presented a procurement plan for the first year of&#13;
project implementation acceptable to the Bank. During the Annual Review Meetings, the&#13;
Bank would review the procurement schedule for the following year, specifying the&#13;
packaging of contracts into international or national tenders, as well as the number and&#13;
estimated costs of the subprojects to be financed under the loan.&#13;
Disbursements and Documentation of Expenditures&#13;
6.22  The proceeds of the Loan (US$300 million equivalent) would be lent to the&#13;
Federative Republic of Brazil. The Government would pass them on to BNDES and BB&#13;
which would, in turn, use the Loan in conjunction with funds from other international&#13;
credit agencies to finance subprojects. The proceeds of the Loan would be passed on to&#13;
the beneficiaries as grants linked to management contracts and output indicators. The&#13;
Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk.  The beneficiaries (i.e., states,&#13;
municipalities, philanthropic providers, NGOs and community-based organizations) would&#13;
contract for works, goods and consulting services and supervise project execution with&#13;
the assistance of approved consultant firms or individual consultants.&#13;
6.23   As a condition of Loan effectiveness, the Borrower would sign a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement on terms acceptable to the Bank, making the funds available to BNDES and&#13;
BB.&#13;

6.24 Disbursement Schedule. The proposed Loan would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of five years up to June 30, 2000 (Table 6.2). The project's completion date, i.e. the final&#13;
date for presentation of requests for approval or authorization to disburse in respect of&#13;
subprojects would be December 31, 1999. The project closing date would be June 30,&#13;
2000, six months after the completion date. Consistent with Bank experience with social&#13;
funds in Latin America, we expect disbursements to occur faster than usual for traditional&#13;
investment projects in Brazil.&#13;
6.25   The percent of expenditures for works, goods and equipment, and consultancies to&#13;
be financed under the loan is given in Table 6.3.&#13;
6.26  Retroactive Financing. The Bank would financing contracts retroactively for&#13;
eligible expenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to Loan signing, up to an amount of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
US$30 million. These funds would be used for financing eligible sub-projects approved in&#13;
line with the eligibility and appraisal criteria acceptable to the Bank and IDB.&#13;

6.27 Documentation. The PMU would present filll support doculmentation for all&#13;
withdrawal applications with a contract value of US$3,000,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
-works, US$350,000 equivalent or more for goods, US$100,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
services of consultant firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultant contracts.&#13;
The PMU would submit withdrawal applications of smaller contract values having a&#13;
statement of expenditures (SOEs), and would maintain the respective supporting&#13;
documents for Bank review.&#13;
6.28 Special Account. The Ministry of Health would open a Special Account at Banco&#13;
do Brasil, with an initial deposit of US$25 million equivalent. This would correspond to&#13;
about four months of expenditures required under the Project. The Project&#13;
Implementation Unit would forward to the Bank the documentation necessary for&#13;
disbursements (SOEs or full documentation), covering a number of subprojects or&#13;
contracts for services whose aggregate sum would be at least US$5 million.&#13;
Financial Management, Accounting and Audits&#13;
6.29 Audits. Independent external auditors would audit the Project Management Unit&#13;
annually. No later than six months after the end of its fiscal year, the Project&#13;
Implementation unit would submit to the Bank copies of the audit reports containing the&#13;
auditor's opinion on: (a) project accounts, including statements of expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
and the Special Account at Banco do Brazil; (b) whether procurement was carried out in&#13;
accordance with agreed guidelines; and (c) the adequacy of internal controls to minimize&#13;
the possibility of misuse of funds or other improprieties.&#13;
6.30 In addition, auditors would undertake special semi-annual audits of a significant&#13;
sample of subprojects financed under the Project, on the basis of acceptable auditing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
standards and procedures, to review individual contracts, ascertain whether the terms of&#13;
these contracts were complied with, inspect progress of works, reconcile physical progress&#13;
with financial expenses incurred, and state whether procurement guidelines are being&#13;
respected. The auditors would prepare semi-annual reports for the Project Board and for&#13;
the World Bank and IDB, to be submitted no later than two months after each quarter, as&#13;
well as an annual summary.&#13;
6.31   The terms of reference for the special semi-annual audits of a significant sample of&#13;
subprojects financed under the Project (Annex G) and the short-list of auditing firms&#13;
would be agreed at negotiations.&#13;
6.32  Monitoring. The project would be monitored through a number of key&#13;
performance indicators including outcome, output, process and input indicators, as&#13;
detailed in Annex E. Starting on January 1, 1997, the Project Management Unit would&#13;
submit to the Banks semi-annual reports comparing achievements with the set of agreed&#13;
indicators. These reports would include information on:&#13;
(a)   subprojects presented, appraised, under implementation, completed and&#13;
evaluated, including increased coverage and efficiency gains;&#13;
(b)   lists and summary reports of studies, technical assistance summaries; lists&#13;
and outlines of courses, and number of staff trained; and management&#13;
systems installed;&#13;
(c)   progress on implementation of health sector reforms;&#13;
(d)   annual public health expenditure review and budget proposals;&#13;
(e)   full documentation on any subproject of more than US$3,000,000&#13;
equivalent, regardless of the source of financing;&#13;
(f)   project costs and financing;&#13;
(g)   changes in PMU management, structure and operational manual;&#13;
(h)   compliance with key legal covenants;&#13;
(i)   supervision of subproject execution;&#13;
(j)   summary of financial and procurement audit reports; and&#13;
(k)   summary of ex-post evaluation reports on a sample of completed sub-&#13;
projects.&#13;
6.33  Evaluation.  The Project Management Unit would retain the services of an&#13;
independent research organization, such as a university or a research oriented non-&#13;
governmental organization (NGO), to carry out an ex-post evaluation of a sample of&#13;
completed projects, which would consist of a combination of traditional economic&#13;
evaluation and beneficiary assessment. The sample would include a sub-sample of private&#13;
for-profit investment subprojects financed by BNDES loans.  The sustainability of&#13;
subprojects financed with grants and loans wouuld be compared. The relevant terms of&#13;
reference and the short-list of research institutions were agreed at appraisal (Annex G).&#13;
6.34  Bank Supervision.   The project would require about 26 staff-weeks of&#13;
supervision per year, including about 13 weeks in the field. The Bank would carry out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
two supervisions a year, every June and December, as described in Annex J. The&#13;
supervision team would include the task manager and consultants with experience in&#13;
health economics and financing, health policy and administration, health care architecture&#13;
and engineering, biomedical engineering, family medicine, health promotion and disease&#13;
prevention, social sciences (i.e. evaluation and beneficiary assessment), environment, and&#13;
in Bank operations. The World Bank would share with the IDB the responsibilities and&#13;
resources for project supervision, as it has done for project preparation and appraisal.&#13;
7. SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Linkage with Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS)&#13;
7.1   The project is consistent with the most recent health sector work in the World&#13;
Bank generally (1993 World Development Report), and in Brazil (The Organization,&#13;
Delivery, and Financing of Health Care in Brazil, Rep. 12655-BR, and Private Sector and&#13;
Social Services in Brazil: Who Pays, Who Delivers, Who Finances, Rep. 13205-BR),&#13;
particularly with respect to the problems of underfinancing, inequity, inadequate&#13;
regulation, fraud and poor quality of medical care. Most recommendations of that sector&#13;
work would be implemented through the project.&#13;
7.2   The project fully supports the Bank's strategy for the health sector in Brazil as&#13;
described in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Brazil and discussed by the&#13;
Board of Directors on June 29, 1995, as well as the Country Assistance Strategy update to&#13;
be discussed at the Board in June 1996. In health, the Bank's goal is to help the&#13;
Government (a) improve the management, financial viability, and quality of public health&#13;
care systems which serve the poor; (b) carry out its role as a provider of public goods; and&#13;
(c) encourage investments for the underserved and vulnerable groups. In the CAS, a&#13;
health reform loan is considered of sufficient priority to be included in the Bank's&#13;
portfolio, even under the low case of high inflation and low overall lending.&#13;
7.3   The strategy makes two strong recommendations: "to develop and implement a&#13;
formula for transferring federal funds to the states and municipalities that improves equity"&#13;
and "to develop a package of essential services of acceptable quality compatible with the&#13;
present level of public health expenditure". The project would incorporate the first of&#13;
those recommendations by means of a formula for pre-assigning investment funds among&#13;
states, based on poverty and health indicators as well as population, before approving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
subproject proposals within each state.  Besides improving equity, this formula will&#13;
prevent a large share of investments from going to those states with greater capacity to&#13;
formulate subprojects. The second recommendation in the CAS, to publicly find only a&#13;
limited list of interventions at current spending levels, has been rejected by the&#13;
Government, on the basis that it would contradict the Constitutional requirement of free&#13;
health care. However, as indicated above, the Government has agreed to distinguish&#13;
among interventions and pay the full cost of those on a priority list of more cost-effective&#13;
services, while paying less than full cost for lower-priority interventions.  It has also&#13;
committed to increasing federal health spending to cover the agreed differentiated rise in&#13;
reimbursement rates.&#13;
7.4   The project would be complemented by a parallel track of broad political dialogue&#13;
which would address a number of important sector issues not addressed by the project, for&#13;
the sake of project simplicity and implementability: (a) role and size of the National&#13;
Health Foundation -- FUNASA and Central Pharmaceutical Agency -- CEME, (b)&#13;
management of the introduction and diffusion of advanced technologies in the SUS, and&#13;
(c) size of the MoH payroll. The Bank has reviewed the terms of reference for the&#13;
relevant technical assistance, which would be financed under the project. In addition, the&#13;
Bank is considering a Government concept paper for a possible project which would&#13;
decentralize the control of infectious disease to states and municipalities, addressing the&#13;
role and size of FUNASA in a decentralized SUS. It is also initiating sector work that&#13;
could lead to a follow-up operation in the Northeast.&#13;
7.5    The project is also consistent with the recommendations of the HDD paper for the&#13;
Board, "Getting Results in the Social Sectors: An Agenda for Action." In particular, that&#13;
paper recommends focusing less on a "blueprint" and more on a process. The project&#13;
does exactly that: it does not specify the content of the investments to be financed, but&#13;
does specify the process for selecting, financing and evaluating them. Similarly, it specifies&#13;
a process for setting tariffs to providers according to the costs and the priority of&#13;
interventions.&#13;
Analysis of Project Alternatives&#13;
7.6   The project would primarily finance investments in infrastructure and management&#13;
of publicly-owned or publicly financed non-profit private health care facilities. This raises&#13;
questions at three levels: first, what would happen if there were no project, or if the Bank&#13;
did not participate in it? Second, should it be a single project, or would it be advisable to&#13;
delay an investment operation until reforms were better defined and implemented? Third,&#13;
what is the best project design? In particular, (a) should the investment be limited to&#13;
publicly-owned facilities? (b) should private non-profit providers be fully subsidized or&#13;
have to repay part of the investment under the project? and (c) should private for-profit&#13;
providers also have access to the investment funds?&#13;
7.7   The diagnosis of the current situation of SUS is that it cannot continue to function&#13;
with payments to providers that are on average well below costs. If tariffs are not raised,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
two trends will accelerate: those able to afford private insurance or obtain it through their&#13;
employment will abandon the publicly-financed system, and the quality and coverage of&#13;
care available to those who depend on the public system will deteriorate further. In the&#13;
absence of an investment and reform project, therefore, there would still be a need to raise&#13;
tariffs, and in fact the Govemment already did raise them by 25 percent, and is committed&#13;
to another 15 percent increase in 1996, differentiated by the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
interventions.&#13;
7.8   If the situation of the SUS were in other respects the same as it is now, but the&#13;
Government had not undertaken any of the reforms described earlier, there would be a&#13;
strong argument for holding off an investment operation. At the moment, some proposed&#13;
reforms are at the conceptual stage and have not been tested; this is the case for the use&#13;
of differentiated tariffs to induce changes in output toward greater cost-effectiveness, and&#13;
for recovery of costs from privately-insured patients. However, the Government has&#13;
already made substantial progress in negotiating expenditure ceilings, abolishing&#13;
quantitative controls on ambulatory care procedures and allowing states and municipalities&#13;
to shift resources between hospital and ambulatory care, improving the detection of fraud,&#13;
and raising tariffs overall. To hold off longer on needed investments, especially those&#13;
where large costs have already been sunk without result, or those where small sums for&#13;
rehabilitation would markedly improve the quantity or quality of services, would actually&#13;
jeopardize gains already made by the ongoing reform.&#13;
7.9   The third question, of the right design for a single investment operation which will&#13;
support existing and planned reforms, can be broken down into three more specific issues.&#13;
Limiting the investment to publicly-owned facilities would ignore the fact that SUS&#13;
operates to a large extent through non-profit private hospitals and clinics that depend&#13;
overwhelmingly on public financing. To discriminate against them would make it hard for&#13;
them to continue functioning in competition with the publicly-owned services, and would&#13;
reduce the technical efficiency of the system even further. It would also affect equity, since&#13;
the distribution of capacity between public and private non-profit facilities varies from&#13;
place to place and from service to service; limiting the investment to public facilities would&#13;
favor some areas and interventions, but not necessarily those that the project should&#13;
promote. Therefore it was decided that, on the grounds of both equity and efficiency, no&#13;
distinction should be made between publicly-owned facilities and those that are publicly-&#13;
financed but private non-profit. This does not mean that the nature of investments will be&#13;
the same in the two sub-sectors, because the public sector includes many more projects&#13;
that were left unfinished during the fiscal crisis of 1992-93, whereas the philanthropic&#13;
sector needs a larger number of smaller rehabilitation investments for facilities that are&#13;
already functioning. To ensure that the larger, incomplete public sub-projects do not use&#13;
up all the investment resources, the Govemment has agreed to pre-assign 25 percent of&#13;
the funds to private non-profit facilities.&#13;
7.10   Project financing of investment in such a facility should be limited to the share that&#13;
will be used to provide services to the SUS, because some philanthropic facilities depend&#13;
on SUS for only part of their revenue and eam the rest by selling services to privately-&#13;
insured patients. Two subsidiary issues remain unresolved: (i) even a partial subsidy may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
lead to investments on services sold in a greater proportion to non-SUS buyers;&#13;
investment proposals from providers that receive substantial revenues from non- SUS&#13;
sources may therefore get closer screening or auditing than others; and (ii) SUS/non-SUS&#13;
revenue shares may not be stable over time; thus, the choice of which year(s) to use in&#13;
calculating the project share in investment will be somewhat arbitrary. Neither difficulty&#13;
prevents the project from funding all non-profit facilities under the same criteria in&#13;
proportion to their dependence on SUS.&#13;
7.11   Private for-profit providers will not receive financing from the proceeds of the&#13;
loan. They will, however, have access to loans provided by the BNDES. BNDES will&#13;
apply to its loans to private for-profit health care providers, the same criteria that the&#13;
project would apply to public and non-profit investment proposals. This might reduce the&#13;
BNDES health facility loans in return for pushing private borrowers toward the criteria of&#13;
equity and allocative efficiency that the project is meant to promote.&#13;
7.12   Two types of onlending terms were considered: (a) subloans on terms equivalent&#13;
to the Bank loan, or (b) grants linked to establishment of performance contracts and clear&#13;
output indicators. The first option was rejected because of (a) the immediate fiscal impact&#13;
of raising tariffs in the short run to a level which would cover the costs of capital, (b) more&#13;
complicated implementation arrangements, and (c) lessons learned in other countries (eg.&#13;
Philippines), in which it has been difficult to recover loans to public and philanthropic&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
Fiscal Impact and Project Sustainability&#13;
7.13   Project sustainability depends on the capacity of the Government to cover the&#13;
operating costs of the SUS. Such costs can be expected to increase as a result of: (a)&#13;
increased tariffs paid by the SUS (this will be largest fiscal impact); (b) increased recurrent&#13;
expenditures to make use of the capital created or restored by the project; (c) higher&#13;
volume of some services due to the investments or stimulated by the tariff increases; and&#13;
(d) population growth. There are two potential sources of reduced costs: reduction in&#13;
fraud (which would allow buying the same real services at lower expenditure or more&#13;
services for the same money), and recovery of costs from privately insured patients&#13;
(provided new legislation allows this). The project will also reallocate resources from low&#13;
priority areas to higher priority areas.&#13;
7.14   Tariff Changes. Estimates of SUS spending for 1996 already include an average&#13;
increase of 34 percent in tariffs, with respect to their 1995 level. This will rise to 50&#13;
percent in 1997, after which tariffs are assumed constant in real terms: it is estimated that&#13;
tariffs need to rise between 50 and 70 percent to cover the costs of most services. With&#13;
differentiated tariffs, and assuming that average prices are the same for both more- and&#13;
less cost-effective services, a 50 percentage average tariff increase is compatible with&#13;
raising SUS prices by 70 percent on 70 percent of output, and no increase in services.&#13;
Alternatively, there could be a 70 percent rise on half of current output and an increase of&#13;
18 percent in the services whose relative price increased. If nothing else happened except&#13;
this adjustment to average tariffs, and an increase of two percent per year to accommodate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
population growth, SUS expenditure would rise to almost US$12.7 billion by the year&#13;
2001.&#13;
7.15   How changes in tariffs will affect output of services and expenditure on them is&#13;
unknown, because SUS operates under three kinds of federal controls at once: on the&#13;
tariffs paid to producers for services, on the number of patients whose hospitalizations (9&#13;
per 100 population per year) will be financed, and on total expenditure by the federal&#13;
government, state by state. Services in excess of one or more of the Federal controls--&#13;
whether more services or higher payments--must be financed by states and municipalities,&#13;
by insurers, by whatever charitable contributions sustain the philanthropic providers, by&#13;
the patients themselves, by internal subsidies from more profitable to less fully-financed&#13;
services, or by losses such as deterioration of capital. States are permitted under special&#13;
circumstances to spend more that the allocated ceiling, up to a margin of five percent for&#13;
states in the South and 12 percent for states in the Northeast.&#13;
7.16   Recurrent Costs from Capital Investments. The second element of additional&#13;
recurrent cost comes from the capital investments supported by the project. Table 7.1&#13;
shows how the US$750 million in project funds might be divided through time and among&#13;
the five major categories of expenditure: 70 percent on physical investment, 12 percent on&#13;
management improvements, 10 percent on the family health program and the remaining 8&#13;
percent on Component II.&#13;

7.17 It remains to estimate, for each type of investment, the coefficient between capital&#13;
expenditure and additional recurrent expenditure. Component II, the improvement of&#13;
Government capacity to set policy and manage the system, should have no effect on SUS&#13;
expenditures, although it might either raise or lower what is spent on central functions.&#13;
Therefore, this coefficient is assumed to be zero. The same assumption is made for&#13;
investment in management and maintenance improvements, which would raise recurrent&#13;
spending, if facilities currently operate at less than capacity for lack of maintenance and&#13;
administrative ability, and if federal expenditure ceilings were not binding, but could&#13;
reduce the costs of providing services. For the family health promotion program, an&#13;
estimate from private sector experience is used, given that the coefficient for ambulatory&#13;
care as about 1.15. By the time investment in the program is complete, it is therefore&#13;
expected to generate some $ 86.25 million annually in additional spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
7.18   The additional recurrent spending generated by the US$525-million investment in&#13;
infrastructure and equipment will depend on the nature of the subprojects financed. The&#13;
Government has canvassed states and municipalities to assemble a list of almost 3,000&#13;
potential subprojects, which over-represents public facilities and includes relatively few&#13;
philanthropic providers. In consequence, the list under-represents hospitals: philanthropic&#13;
facilities are nearly all hospitals, whereas public facilities include many small health posts.&#13;
The Government wants to ensure than no more than half the investment in the project&#13;
goes into capacity for hospitalization, but the share going to hospitals could be larger,&#13;
since these facilities also provide much ambulatory care. Three-quarters of the proposals&#13;
involve construction, to expand a facility, rehabilitate it, or complete it in the case of&#13;
projects which were halted in consequence of the fiscal crisis of 1991-93.&#13;
7.19   The Ministry estimates that 30 large (200 bed) hospitals, if completed, would add&#13;
6,000 beds to the stock devoted to the SUS, and that a variety of smaller projects would&#13;
add another 2,000 beds. This total of 8,000 new beds would represent an addition of 1.6&#13;
percent to the stock of approximately 500,000 beds in the SUS network. If they were&#13;
used at the same unit cost as the rest, the result would be only US$97 million in additional&#13;
recurrent costs.    Compared to an estimated total of US$236 million in hospital&#13;
investments, this implies a unit cost of nearly US$30,000 per bed, and a recurrent/capital&#13;
ratio of 0.4. This is probably artificially low, because of the ceilings and low tariffs on&#13;
both hospitalizations and overall expenditures.&#13;
7.20   For the investment in ambulatory facilities, the coefficient of 1. 15 used is the same&#13;
as for the family health program. For those sub-projects which are on average only 30&#13;
percent finished, US$1.00 of project investment represents US$1.43 of additional capital.&#13;
The estimated impact on recurrent spending is therefore US$1.64 (1.43 times 1.15) per&#13;
dollar of project investment. The overall ratio will lie between these values, perhaps&#13;
around 1.25.  It will apply to 40 to 55 percent of total investment, or US$210-289&#13;
million. This implies a total increase in recurrent spending of US$260-360 million.&#13;
7.21   Combining these estimates yields a total of US$450-500 million in annual recurrent&#13;
financing. This is small compared to the additional expenditure implied by a 50 percent&#13;
increase in tariffs, even if output of services were not to respond to the price rise. And the&#13;
true impact may be smaller, because the number of beds to be put into service will be&#13;
closer to the estimate of 8,000 cited above, and/or the rehabilitation subprojects will have&#13;
more effect on quality than on increased output of services. This is particularly important,&#13;
because the goal of many of the investments is to improve services or bring them closer to&#13;
the population and reduce overcrowding at some facilities. Completely new capacity is&#13;
needed in the North and parts of the Northeast, but elsewhere in the country the impact on&#13;
additional output may be small compared to its improved quality, spatial redistribution,&#13;
and shift in composition. Because of these factors, additional recurrent costs before tariff&#13;
increases might be as low as half those estimated here, or only US$200-250 million&#13;
annually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
7.22   To estimate the distribution of the recurrent cost impacts from investment through&#13;
the life of the project, it is assumed that hospital investments total US$260 million and&#13;
ambulatory care investments US$265 million. The fiscal effect is US$475 million, divided&#13;
between US$170 million of hospital-related costs and US$305 million for ambulatory&#13;
facilities, which is distributed in proportion to the investments shown in Table 7.1 with a&#13;
one-year lag. Changes in the temporal distribution of the investments would not affect the&#13;
long-run constant level of US$561 million, but only the speed with which recurrent&#13;
expenditure converged on that amount.&#13;
7.23   Cost-recovery from  Privately Insured Patients. It is estimated that if cost&#13;
recovery is legalized and introduced, it would begin to generate revenue in 1997 and reach&#13;
a level of US$380 million annually by 2001, offsetting much of the recurrent cost increase&#13;
from investments. This estimate is based, as shown in Table 7.2, on the following&#13;
assumptions: (a) 20 percent of all Brazilians have private insurance, (b) 30 percent of the&#13;
medical care of the insured is provided by SUS, (c) this care costs the same on average as&#13;
the care provided to the uninsured, and (d) recovery of those costs from insurers rises to&#13;
40 percent of the potential total, by the end of the project. Assumptions (c) and (d) may&#13;
understate the current cost to SUS of subsidizing insured patients, but allow for the&#13;
likelihood that if cost recovery begins, insurers will reduce coverage, raise premiums, or&#13;
provide more care through private for-profit providers; all such changes will reduce the&#13;
potential for cost recovery.&#13;

7.24   Fraud Control. Fraud control can also have a major impact on SUS expenditure.&#13;
The MoH is currently analyzing several types of fraud: (a) reporting a higher number of&#13;
events than those actually delivered; (b) reporting more costly events than actually&#13;
delivered; (c) artificially adding the delivery of special pharmaceuticals or diagnostic&#13;
procedures to hospitalizations in order to secure a higher reimbursement; (d) reporting&#13;
higher hospital length of stay than actually delivered; (e) reporting fictitious events; and (f)&#13;
for ambulatory care, charging the allowable ceiling for laboratory  and diagnostic exams&#13;
rather that the actual volume. Table 7.3 presents examples of fraud associated with&#13;
hospitalizations for 1995.&#13;

7.25   In 1995, fraud control efforts at the federal and state levels detected irregularities&#13;
in the amount of US$774 million. Control of fraud is estimated to save US$1 billion&#13;
already in 1996, with savings of US$1.27 billion by the end of the project: this is based on&#13;
the assumptions that (a) fraudulent billing is constant at 20 percent of total SUS billing&#13;
and (b) half of that amount can be detected with the systems in place. The amount that&#13;
could be recovered would decline if fraud becomes less prevalent--which would represent&#13;
an even greater saving--and would increase if greater spending on control resulted in a&#13;
higher rate of detection.&#13;
7.26   The four sources of changed expenditure related to the project are combined in&#13;
Table 7.4. The first line shows the impact of the tariff increase plus population growth.&#13;
The combination of these impacts with the additional recurrent costs generated by&#13;
investments (line 2 - Plus Recurrent Costs), and the savings from cost recovery (line 3 - Less&#13;
Cost Recovery), leads to estimated SUS spending of US$12.6 billion by the year 2000 (line 4&#13;
- Net Total SUS).  If the savings from fraud control were used to reduce spending rather&#13;
than buying more services, SUS expenditure would come down to an estimated US$11.6&#13;
billion at the end of the project, or about US$2.3 billion more than in 1996 and close to&#13;
US$4 billion over the 1995 level, before any tariff increase.&#13;

7.27 Assuming that all costs other than those of reimbursing providers are frozen,&#13;
following the substantial increases budgeted for 1996, the MoH budget would have to&#13;
grow from US$15.7 billion (US$99 per capita per year, 2.6 percent of GDP) in 1995, to&#13;
US$23.8 billion in 2000 (about US$135 per capita per year, 3.0 percent of GDP) when&#13;
the full fiscal impact of the project would be felt.&#13;
7.28 Financial Sustainability. The GoB is pursuing several options to raise revenues&#13;
to bridge the financial gap between persent levels of health expenditure and those implied&#13;
by the project: (a) in the short-term, significant financing would come from a new two-&#13;
year tax on financial transactions--CMF, expected to be approved by Congress soon, while&#13;
more stable sources of revenue are secured; (b) earmarking of 30 percent of the Social&#13;
Security Budget to the health sector as defined in the Constitution; and (b) persuading&#13;
states and municipalities to increase the share of their budgets allocated to health from the&#13;
present 3-5 percent to 10 percent. Table 7.4, Scenario 1 estimates revenues under the&#13;
assumption that CMF is approved and is later replaced by contributions from both Social&#13;
Security Budget (SSB) and from state and municipal budgets. Scenario 2 assumes than&#13;
only contributions from SSB replace the CMtF contribution, and that the SSB would grow&#13;
with the economy at a 5 percent rate. Under both scenarios, revenues would match the&#13;
expenditures generated by the project. Should none of the above materialize, there is still&#13;
room for shifting resources from the non-SUS activities of the Ministry to finance medical&#13;
care. Also, the investment program size and the increase in reimbursement rates would be&#13;
agreed annually with the Government, on the basis of the estimated revenues. The&#13;
proposed reimbursement system would make benefits match public resources available for&#13;
the system by shifting interventions between Priority I and 2, and between Priority 2 and&#13;
3, as well as by adjusting the reimbursement rates for Priority 2 and 3 interventions (para.&#13;
4.9 (b) and (c)). The size of the investment committed for each year would be agreed on&#13;
the basis of the previous year's SUS budget performance and on the basis of the SUS&#13;
budget proposal for the following year.&#13;
7.29. Proposals for earmarked funds are generally unsatisfactory, and can only be&#13;
counted upon to bridge the financial gap the short run. The long-term viability of the&#13;
project depends on a long-term revenue commitment, together with continued control of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
state level budgets, and a concentration of output on more cost-effective services,&#13;
promoted by the differential tariffs. In addition, the project is introducing the concept of&#13;
cost-recovery for services provided to privately insured patients, which could raise&#13;
revenues up to US$250 million per year. This will take time to build into a quantitatively&#13;
important financing item, but represents a significant qualitative change in responsibility.&#13;
Finally, through transparent formulas for allocation of Federal funds, the project creates&#13;
incentives for states and municipalities to increase the share of their own resources&#13;
devoted to health.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Analysis and Lessons Learned from Previous Bank&#13;
Operations in Brazil&#13;
7.30   The REFORSUS  project would complement five other projects in Brazil.&#13;
Presently, Brazil has one of the Bank's largest portfolios, being, as of June 1995, the fifth&#13;
largest in terms of number of commitments and the fourth largest in number of ongoing&#13;
projects. Since 1949, the Bank has financed 122 projects in Brazil. From these projects,&#13;
including the ones in health, the Bank has drawn several relevant lessons. In particular,&#13;
the Bank has faced the following problems in implementing projects in Brazil (i) frequent&#13;
changes in Government policy; (ii) inadequate project design; (iii) poor management&#13;
arrangements; and (iv) excessive number of covenants.&#13;
7.31   Changes in Government Policy.  In the past, various changes in Ministry&#13;
positions have often resulted in decreasing commitment by the Brazilian authorities to&#13;
project objectives.  During the last 15 years, projects have had their implementation&#13;
timeframe altered and new government administrators have decided not to continue the&#13;
previous administration's projects.  Yet these problems seem to have been partially&#13;
reduced lately with the successful implementation of an economic reform that has&#13;
diminished both the political and financial instability in the country. After experiencing&#13;
inflation rates up to 2000 percent a year, for the first time Brazil is being able to keep it in&#13;
acceptable levels and to grow economically.  Other factors positively influencing the&#13;
project are: (i) the large amount of human and physical resources that has been invested in&#13;
the project during its preparation; (ii) the number of stakeholders extensively involved in&#13;
project identification, preparation and appraisal (para. 7.38 -- 7.40); in case of&#13;
governmental change, one could expect sufficient consensus on the objectives and design&#13;
of the project to maintain it among the priorities of other governments; and (iii) finally, the&#13;
municipalities, states and non-profit health care providers, who would prepare and present&#13;
subprojects and ultimately be the major beneficiaries of the project and make up a strong&#13;
constituency for the overall project.&#13;
7.32  Inadequate Project Design. Several projects in Brazil have been preceded by&#13;
poor institutional analysis. The lack of institutional studies and blueprint designs have&#13;
been reflected in the layout and implementation of projects, which most often had to be&#13;
reviewed during execution, causing delays in implementation and additional costs. The&#13;
REFORSUS project, besides being preceded by broad institutional discussions and&#13;
support, has been designed as a demand-driven fund-like project, whereby funds are&#13;
allocated to different geographical areas on the basis of agreed criteria, and subprojects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
are presented by the beneficiaries, ensuring them  ownership.  This demand-driven&#13;
approach will facilitate the implementation of the project.&#13;
7.33  Poor Project Implementation Arrangements. The structure of the Brazilian&#13;
public sector, the number of covenants and transactions involved in each project, and the&#13;
lack of adequate assistance on the part of federal government to ongoing projects, all of&#13;
them have constituted a source of frustration for the Bank. For the REFORSUS project,&#13;
three problems have been identified during appraisal:  (a) the MoH procedures are&#13;
cumbersome and its administrative capacity is often low; (b) a large number of financial&#13;
transactions between the Bank and the ultimate contractor or beneficiary has delayed&#13;
disbursement and implementation; and (c) Federal project management units have not been&#13;
able to provide adequate technical assistance and supervision to a large number of states.&#13;
Although the MoH is burdened by cumbersome administrative procedures, it has been able&#13;
to successfully manage five Bank-financed projects, and the latest operation - AIDS and&#13;
STD Control (Ln.3659-BR), has been well-managed. The project would use BNDES and&#13;
BB as financial agents, which would contract directly with the beneficiary or with the&#13;
providers of works, goods or technical assistance. Such an arrangement would avoid the&#13;
ministry's bureaucracy and reduce the number of financial transactions between the Bank&#13;
and the contractor or beneficiary. The MoH would keep the technical appraisal and&#13;
supervision functions, areas in which it is strong, while it would subcontract to BNDES&#13;
and BB all administrative and financial transactions.  The PCU regional technical&#13;
assistance offices would help weaker states and municipalities in subproject preparation,&#13;
evaluation and supervision. In addition, the MoH would retain the services of an&#13;
independent consulting firm for purposes of carrying out evaluations of subprojects.&#13;
7.34  Excessive Number of Covenants. Conditionality was reduced to the greatest&#13;
extent possible and set, as much as possible to be fulfilled at negotiations. The remaining&#13;
covenants, considered as critical to the sustainability of the project would be monitored in&#13;
November 1997 and 1998 (Annex J).&#13;
7.35  Performance Indicators. The project would include a number of performance&#13;
indicators, covering inputs, process, output and outcomes (Annex E). Project supervision&#13;
would focus on the agreed indicators. These indicators would be regularly monitored,&#13;
deviations analyzed, and corrective actions taken.&#13;
National Bank for Social and Economic Development - BNDES&#13;
7.36 The BNDES is a public development bank through which the Federal Government&#13;
executes its investment policy, including the financing of both public and private&#13;
investments in infrastructure and development. Though administratively linked to the&#13;
Treasury, it has a legal status under private law and has its own equity. BNDES has two&#13;
subsidiaries: BNDESPAR, which offers support through purchases of shareholdings, and&#13;
FINAME, which facilitates the purchasing of equipment and machinery by extending&#13;
medium- and long-term loans to producers and users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
7.37  Fifty-five percent of BNDES's equity and liabilities comes from revenues under the&#13;
social security programs (FIS/PASEP and FAT), which are registered trust funds&#13;
administered by the BNDES. In addition, it manages other minor funds and programs&#13;
such as the Merchant Marine Fund (FMM), the Social Investment Fund (FIS).&#13;
Approximately 16 percent of the BNDES's funds come from domestic and external loans,&#13;
and from the World Bank, the IDB, the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and KfW. The&#13;
total assets of BNDES as of December 31, 1994, were about US$40 billion equivalent,&#13;
and its portfolio was approximately US$19 billion equivalent.&#13;
7.38  BNDES has become Brazil's largest supplier of medium- and long-term credit. It&#13;
has extended financing to practically all sectors of the economy, including the health&#13;
sector where it has financed rehabilitation and re-equipment of private hospitals. It carries&#13;
out its operations directly or through financial agents.  Initially, the objective of the&#13;
BNDES was to support public sector projects, often for import substitution. In recent&#13;
years, in line with government policies, it has switched into financing mostly private sector&#13;
projects which integrate Brazilian markets competitively with the rest of the world.&#13;
7.39   The BNDES will have a dual role in the REFORSUS project. First, it would&#13;
provide technical assistance and serve as financial agent for investment subprojects valued&#13;
at US$3 million or more, under the terms agreed with the Ministry of Health and the&#13;
Banks. Second, it would make available the equivalent of US$400 million for lending to&#13;
private sector hospitals, ambulatory services and networks. These resources would be lent&#13;
at market rates and within the technical criteria agreed with the MoH. The ex-post&#13;
evaluation of subprojects described in para. 6.33 would include a sample of such&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
Banco do Brasil&#13;
7.40  The Banco do Brasil (BB) is Brazils's largest financial institution. It has 24 percent&#13;
of demand deposits of the banking system, holds about 20 percent of all system's savings&#13;
accounts and 15 percent of mutual funds. Its assets are the largest in the country: US$8. 1&#13;
billion equivalent. The BB has 380,000 shareholders, of which the Treasury is the largest&#13;
with 29 percent of total capital and 51 percent of voting shares. About 20 percent of&#13;
voting shares are in the hands of pension funds and the remainder in the public domain.&#13;
Shares are actively exchanged in the the exchange. About 40 percent of BB's operations&#13;
are agriculture credits and another 40 pecent in industry, commerce, consumption and&#13;
personal loans.&#13;
7.41   The Banco do Brasil has an extended network of agencies which cover the entire&#13;
country and has a large experience as financial agent in onlending operations for&#13;
Government agencies and BNDES, including BNDES' health sector operations. BB is&#13;
presently the financial agent for the following projects: Rain Forest Protection Pilot&#13;
Project -- US$30 million of grants and loans from the Group of Seven (G-7) Countries,&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Modernization Project -- US$240 million loan from the IDB,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
Income and Employment Generation Project -- US$1.23 billion from the GoB, and Social&#13;
Action and Sanitation --US$350 million loan from the IDB.&#13;
7.42  In REFORSUS, the Banco do Brasil would operate as the financial agent for&#13;
subprojects valued at less that US$3 million equivalent, under the terms agreed with the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Bank.&#13;
Social Assessment and Stakeholder Participation&#13;
7.43   Beneficiaries.  The final project beneficiaries would be the 110 million who&#13;
depend on the SUS for publicly subsidized health care. The direct beneficiaries of the loan&#13;
would be municipalities, states, and non-profit health care providers who would have&#13;
subprojects financed by REFORSUS. Although the project would not be a program of&#13;
targeted interventions and of specific groups, it would benefit the poor, as they are&#13;
disproportionately represented among the users of the SUS. In addition, the project&#13;
would indirectly target the poor by: (a) pre-assigning grant ceilings to different states on&#13;
the basis of poverty indicators, among others; and by (b) requiring differentiated&#13;
counterpart funds from municipalities, states, and charities, again on the basis of poverty&#13;
indicators. To determine the leverage that beneficiaries have on the choice of subprojects&#13;
and allocation of investments, and how they evaluate the impact of REFORSUS, a&#13;
beneficiary assessment (BA) will be undertaken during project implementation. The BA&#13;
will focus its attention on: (i) the process through which subprojects are generated in&#13;
municipalities; (ii) the state-level decision-making process through which projects are to&#13;
be financed.&#13;
7.44  Stakeholder Involvement.  The major stakeholders in the project are the&#13;
Government, which finances the SUS, and public and private providers who would&#13;
propose subprojects. All have been involved directly or indirectly in project identification,&#13;
preparation, and appraisal, and would participate in project supervision.&#13;
7.45   The Federal Government took the lead in project identification, preparation, and&#13;
appraisal. States and municipalities has been consulted through their representatives in the&#13;
National Health Council -- CNS, the National Council of State Health Secretaries --&#13;
CONASS, the National Council of Municipal Health Secretaries -- CONASEMS. In&#13;
addition, the wider society has also consulted through their representatives in the Senate&#13;
and Congress social committees.&#13;
7.46  During implementation, the beneficiaries themselves (i.e., municipalities, state and&#13;
non-profit health care providers) would be empowered to prepare and propose their&#13;
respective subprojects, from the bottom up. The community, which is the ultimate&#13;
beneficiary, will clear subprojects through their representatives in the municipal health&#13;
councils. State Bipartite Management Committees, which integrate municipal and state&#13;
representatives, will approve subprojects in each state. Finally, beneficiaries will manifest&#13;
their opinion in the continuing, independent, ex-post evaluation of subprojects, which will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
be a mix of traditional economic evaluation and beneficiary assessment. Their opinion will&#13;
in turn feed back into the ongoing adjustment of project design and implementation.&#13;
8. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
8.1   The REFORSUS project has given a B environmental rating. The project would&#13;
have a positive environmental impact by specifically addressing the issue of safe handling&#13;
of medical waste. An environmental study for the health sector in Brazil was carried out as&#13;
part of preparation, to review the main sector issues and to set the environmental&#13;
requirements for subprojects to be financed under the project: beneficiaries would have to&#13;
present adequate environmental and safety management plans addressing such issues as&#13;
the segregation and handling of wastes, their further transportation and disposal away&#13;
from the health facility, and training of facility employees on environmental and safety&#13;
issues. Requirements would be differentiated by the type of facility and nature of the&#13;
wastes.  Subprojects will be classified into three environmental categories:  low (i.e.&#13;
infected wastes, medium (i.e. with both infected and hazardous chemical wastes) and&#13;
complex environmental impact (i.e. involving radioactive wastes). The PCU would&#13;
include environmental specialists to ensure adequate environmental subproject review.&#13;
Bank environmental specialists will participate regularly in supervision missions.&#13;
9. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
9.1   Benefits.  The project is a targeted poverty alleviation intervention and would&#13;
benefit mostly the poor who have the SUS as their only source of publicly subsidized&#13;
health care. The revision of the reimbursement rates will correct price distortions which&#13;
specifically disadavantaged the poor, while the proposed investments and resource&#13;
allocation formula would redirect public investment toward physical infrastructure and&#13;
basic health services for the poor. Given that this is a demand-driven project it is difficult&#13;
to estimate ex-ante the overall economic benefits which will depend on the volume and&#13;
composition of individual subprojects. However basic assumptions using comparable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
regional experiences"2 show that improved the access and the quality of basic clinical and&#13;
public health services when provided in a poor area could avoid about 10 percent of the&#13;
burden of disease, measured in reduced number of disease-adjusted life-years lost. Family&#13;
medicine pioneer experiments in Brazil have been successful: in Parana, between 1986&#13;
and 1994, the program reduced infant malnutrition from 18 percent to 4 percent, increased&#13;
vaccination rates from 47 to 75 percent, broadened coverage of prenatal care by 33&#13;
percent, and reduced hospital admissions by 20 percent. Relative priority will be given to&#13;
maternal and infant care services, to emergency and trauma centers. Studies in Mexico&#13;
suggest that delivery and perinatal care could reduce 47 adjusted life years lost due to&#13;
maternal causes per 100 beneficiaries, per year. Expert opinion suggests that adequate&#13;
emergency and trauma services could reduce, in the respective catchment areas, the&#13;
number of life-years lost due to accidents and other external causes by 20 percent, and&#13;
save 6 disability-adjusted life-years per beneficiary per year.&#13;
9.2    Equity. Although the project is not designed specifically to address the issue of&#13;
equity, it will increase the proportion of investments in poor states by establishing new&#13;
formulas for allocating health budgets to states on the basis of population, income and&#13;
health indicators and installed capacity, thus reducing the discrepancy between rich states&#13;
in the South and Southeast and poor ones in the Northeast. In addition, the project would&#13;
limit the reimbursement of expensive tertiary interventions with little cost-effectiveness,&#13;
which are used free of charge by privately insured middle- and upper-class patients.&#13;
9.3    Efficiency.  The project will improve the allocative efficiency of the SUS by&#13;
increasing the proportion of public health funds spent on cost-effective interventions.&#13;
Priority will be given to subprojects in the areas of maternal, child, family health and&#13;
emergency and trauma care, where more cost-effective interventions are delivered, and to&#13;
clear public goods such as blood banks and public health laboratories. In addition, the&#13;
project will establish a new framework for pricing and reimbursing health care providers&#13;
which will favor the reimbursement of more cost-effective interventions at the expense of&#13;
less cost-effective ones.&#13;
9.4   Finally, the project would improve the internal efficiency of the SUS by: (a)&#13;
restoring the system's capacity, (b) putting idle complementary resources back into use;&#13;
(c) reducing the cost of interventions already being provided; (d) improving the&#13;
reimbursement system; (d) requiring improved management systems as a condition for&#13;
receiving funding for rehabilitation and equipment; and (e) reducing fraud. By restoring&#13;
the system's capacity, the project would increase the number of patients treated, and allow&#13;
a more efficient utilization of diagnostic equipment, beds, and operating suites. Health care&#13;
management improvement may improve hospital efficiency (i.e. higher occupancy rates,&#13;
shorter lengths of stay, higher bed turnover, higher number of patients treated). In&#13;
addition, the automation of management systems could reduce overhead costs. Finally,&#13;
12 El Paquete Universal de Servicios Esenciales de Salud, in Economia y Salud, vol 11. (Mexico:&#13;
FUNDSALUD, 1994).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
project incentives for more cost-effective procedures (i.e., day care, outpatient surgery)&#13;
would lead to an increase coverage (i.e., number of patients treated) and to the&#13;
disappearance of waiting lists.&#13;
9.5   Finally, the project would strengthen the capacity of states and municipalities to&#13;
act as health care administrators and purchasers. It is expected that services will better&#13;
reflect the needs of beneficiaries and that accountability and social control will improve.&#13;
In addition, the decentralized financing of health care would also bring efficiency gains, in&#13;
terms of reduced overhead costs.&#13;
9.6    Project Risks. The main risks of the project are: (a) non-compliance with the&#13;
reform agenda, thus jeopardizing the sustainability of the investments; (b) incomplete or&#13;
poor implementation of the project; and (c) lack of revenues to finance the incremental&#13;
recurrent costs which will be generated by the project and adjustments in the&#13;
reimbursement schedules which will be necessary to maintain capital.&#13;
9.7    Non-compliance with the reform agenda could be caused by the return of high&#13;
inflation and by a change in government policy. The return of inflation would make the&#13;
proposed price adjustments extremely difficult. The effect of inflation could only be&#13;
mitigated through indexation of prices to inflation, but this would only contribute to the&#13;
inflationary spiral. The change of government policy would bring a delay in project&#13;
implementation but is unlikely to bring the project to a halt, given the significant&#13;
stakeholder support ensured during project identification and preparation (para. 7.31). The&#13;
risk of project breakdown would be minimized by continuing to involve the stakeholders&#13;
in the identification, preparation and execution of subprojects, and by selecting&#13;
investments on the basis of clear and transparent criteria which could be supported by any&#13;
government. In any case, the Bank would decline to commit against new subprojects&#13;
further if annual expenditure reviews and policy analysis show non-compliance with the&#13;
policy reform matrix agreed with the Government (Annex I).&#13;
9.8    Risks associated with poor or incomplete project implementation can be caused by&#13;
funding poorly justified subprojects, poor administrative capacity and by more developed&#13;
states and municipalities winning a disproportionate share of resources on the basis of&#13;
their comparative advantage in the preparation of subprojects. The risk of funding poorly&#13;
justified subprojects would be minimized by using transparent eligibility and appraisal&#13;
criteria for subprojects, by prior review of large projects by the MoH and Bank and by the&#13;
using the results of the ongoing ex post evaluation of a sample of subprojects as a means&#13;
to improve project implementation. The administrative capacity of the Ministry would be&#13;
strengthened by BNDES which would be the project's financial agent, and by contracted&#13;
consulting services for subproject preparation and supervision, as well as for external&#13;
evaluations and audits.  The risk of richer states and municipalities securing a&#13;
disproportionate share of resources would be minimized by estimating the investment need&#13;
on the basis of population, health and income indicators, and existing capacity, by assisting&#13;
states and municipalities which demand less than the estimated need, and by requiring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
different levels of cofinancing from states and municipalities, again on the basis of income&#13;
and health indicators and existing capacity.&#13;
9.9   Finally, health sector revenues may not be enough to finance the incremental&#13;
recurrent costs which will be generated by the project and adjustments in the&#13;
reimbursement schedules which will be necessary to maintain capital. The risk would be&#13;
minimized by making each year's investment decisions and the scope of the benefits&#13;
package depend on the review of resources available for the SUS, to make sure that the&#13;
fiscal impact of the ongoing and the proposed investments are sustainable (paras. 9.4 and&#13;
9.5). The proposed reimbursement system would make benefits match public resources&#13;
available for the system by shifting interventions between Priority 1 and 2, and between&#13;
Priority 2 and 3, as well as by adjusting the reimbursement rates for Priority 2 and 3&#13;
interventions (para. 4.9. (b) and (c)). The size of the investment committed for each year&#13;
would be agreed on the basis of the previous year's SUS budget performance and on the&#13;
basis of the SUS budget proposal for the following year.&#13;
10. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
Agreements&#13;
10.1  At negotiations, assurances were obtained that:&#13;
(a)   the PCU would be staffed with a General Manager and Line Managers,&#13;
with experience and qualifications acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.11);&#13;
(b)   the Borrower would not significantly change the Operational Manual&#13;
without prior approval of the Bank (para. 6.1 1);&#13;
(c)   most procurement would be carried out by states, municipalities or&#13;
intermunicipal consortia, or philanthropic health care providers following the Bank's&#13;
guidelines, and would use national competitive bidding procedures for both goods and&#13;
civil works with the standard bidding documents for Brazil (paras. 6.13, 6.14);&#13;
(d)   the PCU would retain the services of a financial and procurement auditor&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, to prepare financial and procurement audits every six months on&#13;
the basis of appropriate samples of procurement documentation (paras. 6.29, 6.30);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
(e)   the PCU would retain the services of an independent institution, to carry&#13;
out an ex-post evaluation of a sample of completed projects no later than December 31,&#13;
1996 (para. 6.33);&#13;
(f)   the PCU would submit to the Bank semi-annual reports comparing&#13;
achievements with the set of agreed performance indicators (para. 6.32);&#13;
(g)   the MoH, BNDES and BB would undertake annual project reviews. Based&#13;
on the reviews and on discussions with the Bank, the Borrower, BNDES and BB would&#13;
take all necessary remedial action agreed with the Bank (para. 6.32);&#13;
(h)   within 90 days from effectiveness, the PCU would create three regional&#13;
technical assistance units (para. 6. 1);&#13;
(i)    By November 30, 1996, the borrower would submit the 1997 MoH&#13;
budget proposal with adequate SUS funds, enough to cover the proposed raise in&#13;
reimbursement rates (para. 4.11);&#13;
(j)   Every November 30, after effectiveness, the Borrower would provide&#13;
evidence of compliance with conditions set out in matrix presented in Annex I. In case of&#13;
non-compliance the Bank would decline to approve commitments against new&#13;
subprojects, but would continue to disburse against previously approved subprojects and&#13;
for technical assistance described under Component II -- Institutional Development (para.&#13;
4.11).&#13;

G. TERMS OF REFERENCE OF KEY STUDIES&#13;
1. Burden of Disease Study&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Health planning has been based on traditional health indicators such as mortality&#13;
and morbidity rates, incidence and prevalence of disease and health services supply&#13;
indicators-number of beds, and number of physicians per 10,000 people. None of the&#13;
indicators used until recently has been able to establish an indication of combined lifetime&#13;
effects of premature mortality and permanent or temporary disability due to illness.&#13;
Studying the national burden of disease in Brazil will obtain such an indicator: DALYs&#13;
(Disability-Adjusted Life Years); the estimation obtains the number of DALYs lost to&#13;
premature mortality and those lost due to disability given the present epidemiological&#13;
profile of the country. The study will also provide information on the number of DALYs&#13;
associated to health risk factors such as smoking, or alcohol abuse. DALYs will be&#13;
calculated at the National and State level, by sex and age groups.&#13;
2.    The Government of Brazil is introducing policy reforms which would improve the&#13;
financial viability, efficiency and management of the Unified Health System -- SUS, and&#13;
would expand and improve the delivery of the SUS which is the sole source of care for the&#13;
poor. The World Bank and IDB are supporting the Government with a loan to finance the&#13;
referenced project, which includes two major components: I -- Improvement of health&#13;
care delivery in the SUS, which will fund rehabilitation and equipment, management&#13;
improvement and family health and health promotion subprojects; and II -- Improvement&#13;
of health care financing and regulation, which will establish a sustainable mechanism to&#13;
finance the system, control fraud and ensure the quality of care and promote the&#13;
decentralization of responsibilities and resources to states and municipalities.&#13;
3.    The project will support decentralization  of health  care financing  and&#13;
administration from federal level to states and municipalities, to improve responsiveness to&#13;
local needs, to improve accountability and avoid overheads associated with the present&#13;
centralized system. The decentralization process must be accompanied by well informed&#13;
health planning processes of states and municipalities; the Burden of Disease study will&#13;
improve national and local capability for establishing health priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(disease classification imperfections) and create data base.&#13;
(c)    generate life tables for Brazil.&#13;
(d)    create data bases on disease incidence by age, sex and region.&#13;
(e)    develop by national expert consultation, and/or structured surveys,&#13;
information to estimate disability weights for each disease, illness age of&#13;
onset, duration of illness, etc.&#13;
(f)    calculate DALYs due to early mortality, and to morbidity at the national&#13;
and state levels, by age and sex.&#13;
(g)    calculate DALYs by risk factors.&#13;
(h)    analyze results and discuss with health policy makers.&#13;
(i)    analyze burden of disease which could be averted by improving and&#13;
targeting resource allocation.&#13;

2. Cost-Effectiveness Study&#13;
Background&#13;
I.    Introducing new tools to establish health priorities is an important task for health&#13;
planners and policy makers. To allocate limited health resources where higher health gains&#13;
can be achieved at lower cost is important for the sector's efficiency. The possibility of&#13;
introducing a measure of the number of DALYs (health gains) obtained by the allocation&#13;
of each dollar in the prevention and treatment of specific diseases is achieved by the&#13;
analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a group of interventions.  Studying  the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of a group of interventions in Brazil will allow to establish priorities among&#13;
them, in order to guide resource allocation towards those where health gains achieved are&#13;
higher for each dollar invested.&#13;
2.    The Government of Brazil is introducing policy reforms which would improve the&#13;
financial viability, efficiency and management of the Unified Health System -- SUS, and&#13;
would expand and improve the delivery of the SUS which is the sole source of care for the&#13;
poor. The World Bank and the IDB are supporting the Government with a loan to&#13;
finance the referenced project, which includes two major components: I -- Improvement of&#13;
health care delivery in the SUS, which will fund rehabilitation and equipment, management&#13;
improvement and family health and health promotion subprojects; and II -- Improvement&#13;
of health care financing and regulation, which will establish a sustainable mechanism to&#13;
finance the system, control fraud and ensure the quality of care and promote the&#13;
decentralization of responsibilities and resources to states and municipalities.&#13;
3.    The project will support the introduction of mechanisms to improve resource&#13;
allocation where health gains obtained are higher. This is also important for SUS resource&#13;
allocation in the context of decentralization in order to improve responsiveness to local&#13;
health needs, accountability and resource allocation. The decentralization process must be&#13;
accompanied by well-informed health planning processes of states and municipalities; the&#13;
Burden of Disease study and the study of cost-effectiveness of interventions will improve&#13;
national and local capability for establishing health priorities.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.    The main objective of the study is:&#13;
(a)   to estimate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions in Brazil; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
(b)   to prioritize health interventions according to their cost-effectiveness and&#13;
in conjunction with other criteria used by policy makers and health&#13;
planners when applying the concept to resource allocation.&#13;
Scope of work&#13;
5.    To carry out the study the researchers would:&#13;
(a)    define health interventions associated to the treatment and prevention of&#13;
each of the diseases being considered, which implies the preparation of a&#13;
treatment "protocol".&#13;
(b)   to estimate the cost of those interventions based on the provision of&#13;
services in Brazil, as a result of considering different types of providers.&#13;
Then costs estimates will be representative of different levels of&#13;
efficiency, salary levels, and the cost level of other health inputs.&#13;
(c)    estimate the effectiveness of interventions according to Brazilian&#13;
characteristics, including: demographics, economic conditions, supply of&#13;
health services, access to health care, utilization patterns,and incidence of&#13;
diseases.&#13;
(d)    construct data bases for the interventions to be considered with their&#13;
estimated cost, the associated Burden of Disease, the efficacy of those&#13;
interventions (from world wide clinical trials in the literature) and disease&#13;
incidence.&#13;
(e)    estimate cost-effectiveness ratios for the interventions considered and&#13;
rank them accordingly.&#13;
(f)    analyze and discuss results with health planners, health researchers and&#13;
international experts.&#13;
General Requirement&#13;
6.     The preliminary report should be presented and discussed with the participation of&#13;
health authorities at different levels of government, research institutions, public and private&#13;
health providers and international experts who will contribute with experiences in other&#13;
countries.&#13;
7.    Health economists, data management and information systems experts, physicians&#13;
and an epidemiologist are needed for the implementation of the study.&#13;

3. Ex-Post evaluation of a sample of subprojects&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Government of Brazil is introducing policy reforms which would improve the&#13;
financial viability, efficiency and management of the Unified Health System -- SUS, and&#13;
would expand and improve the delivery of the SUS which is the sole source of care for the&#13;
poor. The World Bank is supporting the Government with a loan to finance the&#13;
referenced project, which includes two major components: I -- Improvement of health care&#13;
delivery in the SUS, which will fund rehabilitation and equipment, management&#13;
improvement and family health and health promotion subprojects; and II -- Improvement&#13;
of health care financing and regulation, which will establish a sustainable mechanism to&#13;
finance the system, control fraud and ensure the quality of care and promote the&#13;
decentralization of responsibilities and resources to states and municipalities.&#13;
2.    The project will finance subprojects proposed on a competitive basis by public and&#13;
philanthropic health care providers, including states, municipalities, NGOs and&#13;
community-based organizations. The impact and sustainability of subprojects will be&#13;
assessed through an ongoing evaluation of a sample of subprojects, which will be a mix of&#13;
traditional economical evaluation and beneficiary assessment.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.    The main objective of the study is to determine the impact and sustainability of&#13;
subprojects financed under the project, on an ongoing basis.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
3.    To carry out the work the researchers will evaluate the impact, the degree of&#13;
stakeholder involvement and ownership, and the sustainability of a sample of subprojects,&#13;
on an ongoing basis, and will feed back results every six months. These results will&#13;
constitute the main instrument to adjust the project on a yearly basis.&#13;
4.    Researchers will select a purpose sample of subprojects which would have been&#13;
concluded during the previous six months. The sample will include typical rehabilitation,&#13;
equipment, management, family health and health promotion projects. It will include a&#13;
subsample of private for profit investment subproject financed with BNDES loans. It will&#13;
cover projects located in all Regions (i.e. in the South and Southeast, North, and&#13;
Northeast regions).  It will include subprojects presented by states, municipalities,&#13;
philanthropic providers, NGOs and community based organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
5.    The researcher will use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, including:&#13;
surveys, participatory observation, interviews, document analysis, fiscal and economical&#13;
analysis, as appropriate.&#13;
Impact. The researcher will look into subproject impact on the quality of care provided&#13;
by the institution funded under the project, including the impact on:&#13;
inputs (i.e. availability and accessibility to List A interventions),&#13;
process (i.e. compliance with quality of care standards agreed in the project),&#13;
outputs (i.e productivity and efficiency), and&#13;
outcomes and sustainability (i.e. tracers, such as maternal fatality rate, selected&#13;
according to the institution involved, and user satisfaction).&#13;
Ownership and stakeholder involvement. The researcher will review the composition&#13;
of the respective Municipal and State Health Councils (i.e. age, sex, occupation, social&#13;
class, recruitment, turnover) frequency of meetings and method for arriving at decisions,&#13;
methods of arriving at priorities, outside pressures, awareness about REFORSUS, relative&#13;
priority of subprojects financed under REFORSUS, the process for evaluating and&#13;
supervising subprojects, supervision of subprojects, and interactions with BNDES and the&#13;
Project Coordination Units.&#13;
Financial Sustainability. The studies will analyze the fiscal impact of the subproject and&#13;
discuss its financial sustainability in the medium term, including cost recovery.&#13;
Final study reports will include specific recommendations on how different project&#13;
implementation arrangements could improve the responsiveness to local needs, efficiency&#13;
and impact in the medium term.&#13;

4. Audit of Subprojects&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    During loan negotiations the World Bank and the Borrower agreed to contract&#13;
independent auditors for auditing the operations of a significant sample of the subprojects&#13;
financed under the Project. Although the Bank, the Borrower and the auditors will jointly&#13;
determine the number of subprojects to be audited by semester, the auditors will select the&#13;
sample to be audited based on their professional judgment (considering, among other factors,&#13;
the importance of the subprojects for the project's success, their materiality and their level of&#13;
risk) and special concerns expressed by the Borrower or the Bank. The auditors will present&#13;
the results of their work in semi-annual and annual audit reports to the Project Board and the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.    The objective of this work is to carry out an independent Performance Audit of the&#13;
activities performed by the different entities that are implementing subprojects under the Health&#13;
Sector Reform Project. The audit will encompass activities involving technical, financial and&#13;
performance aspects of project implementation.&#13;
3.    The audit would be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing&#13;
Standards applicable to the Public Sector, and therefore would include such tests as the&#13;
auditors consider necessary under the circumstances. The specific objectives of the audit are to&#13;
determine whether the institutions have:&#13;
(a)    Fulfilled, in an adequate manner, the obligations contracted under the sub-&#13;
project agreement.&#13;
(b)    Implemented project activities efficiently, effectively, and&#13;
economically.&#13;
(c)    Achieved the objectives and goals proposed for the subproject or made&#13;
satisfactory progress towards achieving such objectives and goals.&#13;
(d)    Produced accurate and dependable accounting and managerial information&#13;
for the subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
4.     The audit should be compatible with auditing standards for performance audits&#13;
published by institutions such as the Latin American Institute for Accounting Sciences&#13;
(ILACIF) or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller General (GAO, Yellow Book). Therefore, the&#13;
audit must include adequate planning and supervision, proper evaluation and testing of the&#13;
internal control structure and systems, and sufficient objective evidence to allow the auditors to&#13;
reach reasonable conclusions on which to base their opinions. The audit reports would include&#13;
a sunimary of the main procedures used for the audit.&#13;
5.    The auditors must be alert for situations or transactions that may indicate fraudulent,&#13;
wasteful or illegal acts and expenditures. If such evidence exists, the auditors would contact&#13;
the duly authorized representatives of the Borrower and the Bank, and exercise caution and&#13;
due professional care in expanding their audit steps and procedures related to illegal acts.&#13;
6.     The auditors should use the following paragraphs as a basis for preparing the audit&#13;
programs and planning the review. These guidelines should not be considered to include all&#13;
relevant topics or to restrict the auditor in any way, nor do they discharge the auditor from the&#13;
responsibility to exercise due care and professional judgment. The audit steps should be&#13;
modified to adjust to local conditions, the specific design and implementation procedures of the&#13;
Project, and provisions of the loan agreement. Any limitation in the scope of work must be&#13;
communicated as soon as possible to the duly authorized representatives of the Borrower and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
7.    It is first necessary to obtain preliminary information about the Project and the&#13;
subprojects subject to audit. The following is a list of documents that may be applicable to&#13;
projects financed by the Bank. The auditors must select those that they considers necessary to&#13;
perform the audit:&#13;
(a)    The loan agreement between the Bank and the Borrower.&#13;
(b)    The loan agreement between the Borrower and the Project Management&#13;
Unit.&#13;
(c)    The agreement between the Project Management Unit and the entity&#13;
implementing the subproject.&#13;
(d)    The Bank's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).&#13;
(e)    International and National Procurement (bidding) Guidelines of the&#13;
Bank and the Borrower.&#13;
(f)    The subproject's financial and physical progress reports; plan or chart&#13;
of accounts, description of the accounting systems; procurement policies  and&#13;
procedures; procedures for the receipt, storage and distribution of goods and material; and any&#13;
other documentation that may be necessary for the successful completion of the audit.&#13;
8.    Review the contract for each subproject, identifying the obligations assumed by the&#13;
subproject implementing entity, and perform any necessary audit procedures for determining&#13;
the level of compliance with the requirements established, where items are significant in value.&#13;
For example, the auditor should verify whether the implementing agency has adequately&#13;
contracted for construction of new facilities, procurement of equipment or other such activities&#13;
(to this effect, the auditors should verify that for the procurement of goods and services, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70&#13;
implementing entity has followed applicable procurement and contracting procedures&#13;
established by the Borrower or the Bank).&#13;
9.    Perform steps necessary for determining whether the activities under the subproject have&#13;
been implemented efficiently, effectively and economically. In this regard, audit activities should&#13;
include a review to ensure that significant activities under the subproject are being, or have&#13;
been, implemented in accordance with agreed timeframes and technical specifications; that&#13;
contracts have been properly valued and paid; and that payments to contractors and consultants&#13;
correspond to works or services actually rendered and in the amounts agreed. Auditors should&#13;
also compare the cost of the contract with the final cost of the works performed, analyzing&#13;
variances with regard to similar works performed in other subprojects. They should also verify&#13;
that the registers for contractors and consultants are properly kept, are periodically updated in&#13;
accordance with agreed procedures, and that they give all qualified contractors/consultants the&#13;
opportunity to participate in the selection process.&#13;
10.   Perform steps necessary to determine whether the implementing entity has achieved the&#13;
objectives and goals proposed for the subproject or made satisfactory progress towards&#13;
achieving such objectives and goals. In this regard, audit activities should include a review of&#13;
the objectives and goals set and the perforrnance indicators agreed to, and an evaluation as to&#13;
whether the goals and objectives are being achieved. The evaluation shall include different&#13;
aspects quantified by the performance indicators agreed to, such as the number of patients&#13;
treated during the period, number of clinical tests or surgical procedures performed, and&#13;
number of families being served. Other factors to evaluate may include, as in the case of&#13;
equipment, whether: (i) system capacity has been restored, (ii) idle complementary resources&#13;
have been put back in use, or (iii) the cost of an intervention already being provided has been&#13;
reduced.&#13;
11.   Perforn  steps necessary for determining whether the entity implementing the&#13;
subproject has established an adequate accounting and financial information system and that the&#13;
data inputted into the system are reasonably reliable. The auditors should verify that accounting&#13;
and intemal control procedures are being complied with, and that documentation related to the&#13;
subproject is properly maintained in accordance with adequate procedures.&#13;
Other Responsibilities&#13;
12.   The auditor should comply with the following requirements:&#13;
(a)    Conduct entrance and exit conferences with the implementing entity. The&#13;
date of these meetings should be communicated to the duly authorized&#13;
representatives of the Borrower and the Bank so that they can participate&#13;
in such meetings, if deemed necessary.&#13;
(b)    Plan the audit work so that audits of different entities can be perforned&#13;
throughout the year.&#13;
(c)    Independently reference the audit report before issuing it. As part of their&#13;
quality control, the auditors must independently reference the final drafts of the&#13;
audit report and the Management Letter (which subsequently in this TOR are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
included in the term "the report"). Before referencing, the draft report must be&#13;
adequately indexed and cross-referenced to the working papers. Each&#13;
statement, date, number, amount and fact that appears in the report must be&#13;
referenced to the corresponding working papers. The reviewer must not be a&#13;
member of the audit team and should report directly to the partner in charge of&#13;
the audit.&#13;
13.   The reviewer must ensure that (a) the content of the report is supported by sufficient,&#13;
competent and relevant evidence in the working papers; (b) the conclusions in the report are&#13;
logical and related to the findings; and (c) the recommendations can be implemented and are&#13;
directed to the cause of the problem or deficiency. The reviewer must ensure that: the contents&#13;
of the report comply with the Auditing Standards used for the audit (which must be clearly&#13;
identified in the audit report); each audit objective has been satisfied; and the findings are&#13;
related to the audit objectives. Each statement, number or amount must also be checked with&#13;
the working papers. Any information presented in tables should also be verified, adding all the&#13;
figures and amounts listed, and checking these against the applicable working papers.&#13;
14.   All reviewer comments must be recorded in a summary sheet and resolved&#13;

5. Annual Reviews&#13;
The annual reviews would be carried out by a combination of Bank staff and&#13;
consultants with specialties in public health administration, health econornics, institutional&#13;
development and management information systems. The reviews would be prepared by&#13;
the PCU, and would include reviews of project implementation reports, discussions with&#13;
the management of the MoH, and visits to selected states. The reviews would take place&#13;
in November of each year. The annual reviews would evaluate project performance&#13;
against implementation plans and agreed targets and provide Bank and MOH management&#13;
with feedback on project achievements. More specifically, the annual reviews would:&#13;
(a)   review implementation of both project components during previous year,&#13;
including commitments, disbursements, and compliance with benchmarks;&#13;
(b)   compare actual results with the program as regards: (i) allocation of funds&#13;
among states, and (ii) allocation of funds among large projects for&#13;
completion and equipment of state and municipal hospitals, projects&#13;
presented by philanthropic hospitals, and small and medium projects;&#13;
(c)   review financial and procurement audits;&#13;
(d)   review ex-post beneficiary assessments;&#13;
(e)   review compliance with loan agreement covenants and Bank guidelines;&#13;
(f)   review overall implementation of health sector strategy, as described in&#13;
policy letter;&#13;
(g)   review financial performance under SUS during previous year, and agree&#13;
on satisfactory financial performance for the next year (as contemplated in&#13;
the policy matrix);&#13;
(h)   review adjustments in reimbursement schedules (as contemplated in the&#13;
policy matrix);&#13;
(i)   review timelines of payment of health services (as contemplated in the&#13;
policy matrix);&#13;
(j)   review implementation of national audit system to reduce fraud (as&#13;
contemplated in the policy matrix);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
(k)   review implementation of quality assurance program (as contemplated in&#13;
the policy matrix), and&#13;
(I)   review progress in implementation of studies and technical assistance.&#13;
2.    The annual reviews would also analyze the performance of the PCU (including its&#13;
regional technical assistance units - URATs) in terms of project implementation and&#13;
coordination of executing actions by the MOH, the states and the municipalities. They&#13;
would assess the extent to which the project management information system is adequate&#13;
to provide the appropriate information for decision-making and reporting to financial&#13;
institutions, including the Bank. The composition of the PCU would be analyzed to assess&#13;
if it is adequate to provide adequate technical support to the executing units.&#13;
3.    The annual reviews would address project performance in terms of flow of funds,&#13;
as contemplated in the contract between the MOH and Banco do Brasil. They will also&#13;
review the quality of economic analysis of large projects and efficiency in contracting of&#13;
consulting services, as provided for in the contract between the MoH and BNDES.&#13;
4.    On the basis of the above, the Bank and MoH will agree on:&#13;
(a)   main issues in project implementation;&#13;
(b)   proposed modifications to project design, if needed, to adjust to changing&#13;
circumstances; and&#13;
(c)   work plan for the coming period.&#13;

AVISO/MS/No361/GM                            Brasilia DF, May 7, 1996&#13;
To the President&#13;
Dear Sir:&#13;
I have the honor to write to you for the purpose of presenting the proposal for the&#13;
REFORSUS Project, "Strengthening the Reorganization of the Single Health System," to be&#13;
carried out by this Ministry. This project is based on the need to guarantee that the principles of&#13;
equity and universality are observed in the Single Health System (SUS), in accordance with the&#13;
laws governing the health sector in Brazil.&#13;
Over the past ten years, the reorganization of Brazil's health system has brought about&#13;
significant changes in the legal, managerial, and institutional aspects of the system, especially by&#13;
unifying and decentralizing activities. The 1988 Federal Constitution, with its repercussions on&#13;
the State Constitutions (1989) and the Municipal Organic Laws (1990), and Federal Laws Nos.&#13;
8080/90 and 8142/90, provides a legal framework that is conducive to and provides an incentive&#13;
for basic changes in the health system.&#13;
In 1993, with the publication of the Health Ministry's Basic Operating Rule 01/93, the&#13;
terms governing the decentralization process were introduced. It provided for the management of&#13;
the health network to be decentralized gradually, in stages. Management conditions were&#13;
introduced for states and municipalities, under which they would increasingly take over&#13;
management of resources transferred by the federal government.  In addition, forums for&#13;
interinstitutional negotiations were set up, including the Tripartite Intermanagement Committee at&#13;
federal level and the Bipartite Intermanagement Committee at state level, made up of&#13;
representatives of the Ministry of Health, states, and municipalities and formed for the purpose of&#13;
negotiating, drawing up proposals, and monitoring the introduction and operation of the SUS,&#13;
under the supervision of the National and State Health Councils.&#13;
This process of organizational reform has not been accompanied by increased financing for&#13;
the sector. On the contrary, flows of financial resources into the sector have continued to be&#13;
limited and have even been further reduced. In view of the volatility of this financing and the lack&#13;
of an adequate remuneration policy for service providers, investment has declined and the quality&#13;
of services rendered has dropped sharply. Both public health care units and supplementary private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
ones have become noticeably obsolete, and inequalities and deficiencies in health care coverage&#13;
and hygiene have worsened. Fees of health care providers have lagged so far behind the average&#13;
cost of services that philanthropic hospitals, the backbone of the public health system, have shut&#13;
down units or dropped out of the system, while public hospitals have reduced the number of beds&#13;
and the range of services offered.&#13;
This deterioration has forced the present government to look for ways to remedy the&#13;
situation. One way is to further the decentralization process initiated in 1993, by strengthening the&#13;
Bipartite and Tripartite Committees, by allowing states and municipalities greater autonomy in&#13;
management, and by guaranteeing a larger volume of federal resources to be transferred as part of&#13;
the general budget. This process is being consolidated through the new SUS Basic Operating&#13;
Rule, meant to further the decentralization process by including automatic, direct transfers of&#13;
financial resources to states and by giving greater responsibility for operating the SUS to State&#13;
and Municipal Health Secretariats. The Rule is also intended to revise the basis of the system for&#13;
paying for services provided by focusing on per capita remuneration for primary health care and&#13;
to define a list of incentives to accelerate the reform process.&#13;
In addition to these changes in the Basic Operating Rule, the Ministry of Health has also&#13;
endeavored to do the following: ensure adequate compensation to health care providers; protect&#13;
the system from subsequent deterioration by making the necessary changes; reduce fraud and&#13;
increase the quality of services, provide for a more equitable allocation of resources to cover&#13;
current and capital costs; and, control and stabilize expenditures.&#13;
In its effort to guarantee that health care providers receive adequate compensation for&#13;
their services, in 1995 the Ministry granted a 25% cost of living adjustment in hospital and&#13;
outpatient procedures, and established a price negotiation board made up of managers and&#13;
representatives of service providers. We also intend to introduce a mechanism for the regular&#13;
revision of health care service providers' fee schedules and to update them on the basis of&#13;
estimates that are closer to the cost of current health care practices. In addition, we plan to&#13;
publish new fee schedules including differential adjustments based on which procedures are most&#13;
cost-effective and full payment for diagnostic or treatment procedures.&#13;
We initiated efforts to protect the system against future deterioration by seeking new&#13;
sources of revenue in 1995, in the form of a bill presented to the National Congress to recover&#13;
costs of care provided to patients covered by supplementary health insurance, and by revising tax&#13;
exemptions for private health care services. Once the law permitting this compensation has been&#13;
promulgated, adequate operating tools will be immediately introduced to make this cost recovery&#13;
viable.&#13;
It was our concern to reduce fraud and guarantee the quality of services that led to the&#13;
introduction of Decree No. 1651/95, which was signed by the President of the Republic and&#13;
regulates the National Audit System (SNA), and to the creation of the National Quality Health&#13;
Care Committee. Regulations are being drawn up and cases of fraud and irregularities are being&#13;
analyzed from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. In 1995, 2 million hospital stays for a&#13;
total of 15 million, or about R$500 million, were paid as a result of these analyses. To increase the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
quality of health sector services, tools to monitor adverse results in maternity clinics were&#13;
developed. This program will be expanded to cover other types of establishments in the next&#13;
three years, and there are also plans to introduce quality control mechanisms in hospitals and&#13;
outpatient units, among other activities, between now and 1998.&#13;
To ensure a more equitable allocation of resources to cover current and investment costs,&#13;
overall ceilings were established, to include hospital and outpatient care. They were based on the&#13;
integrated programs which were agreed with the Bipartite Committees and which provide for a&#13;
prioritized supply of health services and parameters applicable to the demand for those services.&#13;
In the area of primary health care, a per capita remuneration arrangement is being worked out to&#13;
guarantee that all citizens will be treated equally.  As for the allocation of resources for&#13;
investment, a formula was devised to compensate those states and municipalities with fewer&#13;
health care services and thus with reduced public expenditures, so as to increase coverage of the&#13;
population. In the medium run, these instruments will be improved, to increase gradually the&#13;
percentage of resources to cover current and investment expenditures distributed to states and&#13;
municipalities on the basis of more equitable criteria. In this same area, 87 municipalities were&#13;
granted greater autonomy to manage their health sectors (partial management conditions). Once&#13;
the new Operating Rule is in effect, this number will be increased and procedures will be&#13;
introduced for automatic transfers of resources to states that have already officially qualified for&#13;
management autonomy.&#13;
As for control and stabilization of expenditures, in the short run the government is&#13;
increasing transfers to municipalities under the general budget. It plans to extend this process to&#13;
new municipalities and states in the course of this year. In addition, it is introducing mechanisms&#13;
to assess and manage the dissemination of new technologies to the SUS.&#13;
The program to consolidate the SUS, which was initiated in 1995 and is expected to last&#13;
into the next decade, is based on a decentralized management model according to which the states&#13;
and municipalities will assume full responsibility and autonomy and will have the management&#13;
capacity and the capacity to implement the policies required for the purpose.  Under this&#13;
organization plan, the Ministry of Health will fulfill the essential function of making sure that the&#13;
supply of services does not become fragmented and scattered, and that the regional, hierarchical&#13;
system is operating smoothly.&#13;
By the end of this period, all federal funding should be automatically transferred to&#13;
municipalities, which will be directly responsible for supplying services to the people, and&#13;
secondarily to states, so that they can perform their functions of coordinating the system and take&#13;
action to ensure equal access and quality services. The allocation of these resources will be based&#13;
on an integrated financial and physical program determined in the interinstitutional forums.&#13;
By using various incentives, and especially financing arrangements, the Health Ministry&#13;
will try to systematically raise fee levels for all health care services and activities that show&#13;
unquestionable proof of being effective, and it will give priority to those that are recognized to be&#13;
most cost-effective, based on their history of cost-of-living adjustments, average national costs in&#13;
comparison with others, or on the fact that they have been given priority in programs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
determining the general budgets of states and municipalities. Thus, in the course of the next ten&#13;
years, the supply profile will be redesigned, with an increase in effective and cost-effective&#13;
services, to the detriment of those that have not proven to be so.&#13;
Activities under the REFORSUS Project, especially if they continue throughout the&#13;
decade, will make it possible to halt the steady deterioration of the physical infrastructure and&#13;
correct the critical shortcomings in management, while reducing fraud to a minimum and&#13;
guaranteeing acceptable quality standards for health care services. In the short and medium term,&#13;
when the legislature passes the proposed constitutional amendment, which is already being&#13;
discussed by the National Congress, there should be stable and regular sources of a viable amount&#13;
of funding for the SUS.&#13;
In summary, by 2005 the SUS should be operating on the basis of universality, with an&#13;
equitable allocation of resources, and full decentralization of management functions. The sources,&#13;
flows, and amounts of resources should be enough to ensure adequate remuneration for the&#13;
services provided, and especially for those procedures that were selected to be given priority.&#13;
It is in this context and with these prospects in mind that this project has been prepared,&#13;
for the purpose of improving the physical infrastructure of the health care system, and the&#13;
efficiency, management, and quality of the health care system financed by the government and&#13;
directed on a priority basis to provide care for the most vulnerable segments of our population.&#13;
I am looking forward to receiving your cooperation.&#13;
Very truly yours,&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
Health Sector Reform Project -- REFORSUS&#13;
K. ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE IN BRAZIL I AND 2&#13;
1.    Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), which is the sole source of care for 110&#13;
million Brazilians, is unique in Latin America and more comparable to the model of&#13;
Canada and several European countries: (a) coverage is universal, (b) health benefits are&#13;
all-inclusive and free at the time of use; (c) financing comes mostly from general taxation&#13;
and subsidizes the poor, (d) funds are allocated to states and municipalities on the basis of&#13;
prospective global health budgets; (e) most care is delivered by private providers who&#13;
compete for patients, (f) ownership and administration of public services is decentralized&#13;
to municipalities and states, and (g) providers are reimbursed on the basis of production&#13;
(diagnosis-related groups for hospitals, and capitation for ambulatory care). Private health&#13;
insurance plays a significant complementary role for about 24 million people (16 percent&#13;
of the population).&#13;
2.     The supply of health services inputs in Brazil compares well with international&#13;
standards. With 30 hospital beds and 14.2 physicians per 10,000 population, Brazil&#13;
compares favorably with the average for Latin America and other middle-income&#13;
countries. Yet, the ratio of hospital beds per inhabitant declined by almost 14 percent&#13;
during the 1980s. The country has a relative scarcity of nurses, with a 3.7 doctor/nurse&#13;
ratio. The distribution of health services and professionals in the various regions is very&#13;
unequal, being concentrated in the most developed regions and in state capitals. Public&#13;
hospital beds are distributed evenly across the country, ranging from 0.7 beds per 1,000&#13;
population in the South to 0.9 beds per 1,000 in the North. However, there is a shortage&#13;
of private sector supply in the North and Northeast.&#13;
3.    The provision of public health services is organized under the Unified Health&#13;
System (SUS) which integrates the public health network with the private for-profit and&#13;
non-profit networks from which the Government purchases public health services. These&#13;
services represent about 70 percent of total health services provided in Brazil. The&#13;
balance of 30 percent is supplied by the private for-profit network that does not contract&#13;
with the Government and serves patients who are privately insured or pay out of pocket.&#13;
Patients are free to choose between public and private providers contracted by the SUS.&#13;

Box I: Characteristics of the Unified Health System (SUS) Today,&#13;
Flnancing     Financing is primarily public and subsidizes the poor&#13;
Care financed by the Unified Health System (SUS) is free to patients, so poor are not&#13;
discriminated against; rationing is not accomplished through prices&#13;
Private health insurance is allowed and flourishing, but people who pay social scudity&#13;
taxes to support health care are not allowed to divert that money to private insurers&#13;
Health care costs are contained by caps on the number of admissions to hospitals aild&#13;
ceilings on ambulatory care budgets&#13;
Hospitals are reimbursed on the basis of diagnostic related groups so that revenue is tid&#13;
to production and not to a historical budget; ambulatory services are paid on the basis of&#13;
capitation&#13;
Funding for recurrent costs is apportioned among the states and municipiities,.&#13;
proportionally to population&#13;
Investment decisions are based on agreements between the MoH and individual:sates&#13;
and municipalities&#13;
Competition   Care is delivered primarily by private providers; many of these are non-profit whick:&#13;
provide care almost exclusively to SUS patients under contract with the government&#13;
Patients are free to choose among public and private providers&#13;
Regulation    Private insurers are not regulated and use adverse selection and disenrollment&#13;
Quality of care provided by the provided by the private sector is not monitored o&#13;
controlled, even when it is paid by SUS&#13;
Auditing and governance control for both private and public providers is embryonic:&#13;
Autonomy      Ownership and responsibility of public health facilities has been transferred to:&#13;
municipalities and states; the Federal government only manages a dozen hospitals.&#13;
Municipalities and states are gaining increasing health sector planning, administwaive&#13;
and financial autonomy, including the capacity to act as purchasers of health care:&#13;
Management  Public health service management is generally centralized and poor&#13;
Hospitals often lack basic management systems, such as cost-accounting&#13;
Coverage      Universal; free of charge; all inclusive benefit package; in reality, rationing is applied:&#13;
through caps on admissions and budget ceilings&#13;
4.     The private sector plays an important role in the providing services to SUS. In&#13;
1994, it accounted for 79 percent of hospital beds in the SUS, 83 percent of publicly&#13;
funded hospital admissions, and 87 percent of hospital reimbursements. The private sector&#13;
also accounted for 43 percent of publicly funded ambulatory procedures and 73 percent of&#13;
all ambulatory reimbursements. Within the private sector, the for profit/charity ratio is&#13;
about 4/3, both in the hospital and in the ambulatory sectors. University hospitals deliver&#13;
10 percent of all admissions and 5 percent of ambulatory procedures, and absorb 21&#13;
percent and 8 percent of the respective reimbursements.  The balance of services is&#13;
supplied by public hospitals. Primary health care services are owned and managed by&#13;
municipalities or states.&#13;
5.     The Ministry of Health (MoH) is responsible for policy and standards, financing,&#13;
overall planning and coordination, epidemiological surveillance, quality assurance,&#13;
monitoring and control, and auditing. The MoH has few responsibilities in direct health&#13;
care provision. With the exception hospitals and health services of the of all National&#13;
Health Foundation (FUNASA), most public hospitals and ambulatory services were&#13;
transferred to the states and municipalities after 1988. Now, the MoH only owns and&#13;
manages the health services of the Federal District and another dozen tertiary hospitals,&#13;
most of them located in Rio de Janeiro. The Ministry of Education directly owns and&#13;
manages a significant number of federal university hospitals. The MoH executes several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
vertical programs through its specialized agencies including: (a) the National Health&#13;
Foundation -- FUNASA (sanitation and communicable disease control); (b) the Central&#13;
Drug procurement agency -- CEME (procurement, production and control of&#13;
pharmaceuticals); (c) the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation -- FIOCRUZ (post-graduate&#13;
education, research and development, and vaccine production); and (d) the National&#13;
Institute of Food and Nutrition -- INAN. The scope of MoH activities also includes&#13;
environmnent, occupational health, food and drug administration, blood and immune&#13;
products, and border control. Since 1982, successive administrations have decentralized&#13;
both responsibilities and resources to municipalities and, to a lesser degree, to states. At&#13;
present, about 2,000 of the 5,000 Brazilian municipalities have some degree of autonomy&#13;
in health care administration.&#13;
6.     State Health Secretariats have a relatively small and ill-defined role, being&#13;
situated between a strong Federal MoH and the municipal health secretariats. States are&#13;
nominally responsible for: (a) planning, supervising, and evaluating health service delivery&#13;
in their geographic areas; (b) coordinating and providing technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities, (c) managing some tertiary referral centers and public health laboratories;&#13;
and (d) managing public health reimbursement funds for small municipalities that have&#13;
minimal autonomy. Many functions are ill-defined or overlap with those of the MoH and&#13;
the municipalities. In addition, there are hardly any hierarchical relationships between&#13;
states and municipalities, with the latter tending to relate more directly to the Federal&#13;
level.&#13;
7.     The real beneficiaries of decentralization have been the municipalities. Municipal&#13;
Health Secretariats are responsible for planning, organizing, and managing public health&#13;
care delivery in their jurisdiction. In addition, they can authorize hospital admissions and&#13;
ambulatory expenditures as well as contract private providers to deliver the care not&#13;
provided by the public network. When necessary, they can also form intermunicipal&#13;
consortia3 to pool resources and better manage patient flows. Although municipalities&#13;
have the capacity to authorize hospital admissions and ambulatory services, up to pre-&#13;
defined ceilings, the responsibility for expenditures remains mostly with the Federal&#13;
Government who pays the providers directly. Larger and better-managed municipalities&#13;
with advanced autonomy can be entrusted with general public health functions such as&#13;
communicable disease control.&#13;
8.     Degrees of Decentralization.  States and Municipalities are granted different&#13;
levels of autonomy in accordance with their ability to manage, plan, and deliver health care&#13;
activities. In ascending order, there are four levels of autonomy, as follows:&#13;
3 An intermunicipal consortium is an innovative idea that consists of regrouping several municipalities&#13;
to create a critical mass of health care facilities embodying, for example, one tertiary-level university&#13;
hospital, 2-3 secondary or regional hospitals, and sevcral health centers and posts. The main advantages&#13;
of the consortium are that: (i) it achieves economies of scale through the joint purchase of some key&#13;
inputs; (ii) it can organize a meaningful reference system; and (iii) it improves the efficiency of the system&#13;
by separating the financing (by the consortium) from the delivery of services (by individual facilities that&#13;
would sell services to the consortium), and allowing the Federal and State levels to deal with a limited&#13;
number of entities (the consortia) rather than a multitude of municipalities or individual facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
(a)    minimal autonomy (gestio incipiente):  municipalities start managing&#13;
public ambulatory facilities and accrediting private facilities to provide services under the&#13;
SUS. They can authorize hospital admissions and ambulatory expenditures, but have no&#13;
control over the reimbursement funds which are transferred directly from the Federal level&#13;
to the provider. In 1994, there were about 950 municipalities with this type of autonomy,&#13;
out of a total of 5,000 municipalities in the country; in 1995, the Government raised the&#13;
number to 2,000;&#13;
(b)    partial autonomy (gestao parcial): as above, but municipalities can (i)&#13;
decide on the mix of health services they want to purchase and from which suppliers&#13;
(public or private). They receive reimbursement for services provided, and can retain&#13;
savings resulting from efficiency gains. In 1994, about 400 municipalities had partial&#13;
autonomy; in 1995, the number increased to 600 and all states were granted partial&#13;
autonomy;&#13;
(c)    advanced autonomy (gestao semi-plena): states and municipalities are&#13;
full managers of the SUS in their jurisdiction, including both hospitals and ambulatory&#13;
services. They assume responsibility for essential public health services such as nutrition,&#13;
health education, epidemiological surveillance, and occupational health. They receive a&#13;
prospective health sector block grant to be managed together with their own funds (to&#13;
benefit from such autonomy, states and municipalities have to allocate at least 10 percent&#13;
of their budget to the health sector). In 1994, 11 municipalities had advanced autonomy;&#13;
in 1995, the number increased to 44. Four states have been granted advanced autonomy;&#13;
(d)   full autonomy (gestao plena):  in addition to the responsibilities under&#13;
advanced autonomy, states and municipalities would be responsible for carrying out all&#13;
public health responsibilities that are now under the Federal specialized agencies, such as&#13;
the National Health Foundation. No state or municipality at present has such a level of&#13;
autonomy.&#13;
Financing of Health Care 4 and 5&#13;
9.    The 1988 Brazilian Constitution created a Social Security Budget (SSB) to&#13;
finance health, social assistance, social security and unemployment benefits. Funds were&#13;
not earmarked for these various programs. For the health sector, annual complementary&#13;
health and budget legislation were defined as the criteria for funds allocation. During&#13;
Constitution negotiations, however, a transitory legislation established that 30 percent of&#13;
the Social Security Budget would be allocated to the health sector until further specific&#13;
legislation is approved. This allocation was honored for two years but declined later&#13;
because of the pressure to finance pensions, down to a zero contribution in 1994.&#13;

10.    SSB's revenues originate from&#13;
a mix of social contributions and&#13;
MoH's Revenue Sources -1995&#13;
treasury revenues. The contributions&#13;
come from sources: (a) employee and&#13;

17.4%                                       profits -  CSLP; (d) other smaller&#13;
sources (Social Integration Program&#13;
53.8 %        -   PIS  and  Civil Servants  Asset&#13;
Creation Program - PASEP). For&#13;
1995, most of the money to fund the&#13;
MoH's budget will come from&#13;
mandatory business contributions -- COFINS and CSLP, together, they correspond to&#13;
65.2 percent of the MoH's budget. The Emergency Social Fund (FSE) and government's&#13;
revenues from bond market operations (GB) will contribute with another 11.4 and 10.8&#13;
percent of the Ministry's budget.&#13;
11.    Brazil's health care system relies heavily on public reimbursement of privately&#13;
provided services. The system relies on two methods of payment: AIHs/SIHs (hospital&#13;
authorization and payment system) for the payment of hospitals, and UCAs/SLAs&#13;
(outpatient coverage and payment system) for the payment of ambulatory services. Most&#13;
federal funds are transferred directly to providers. The AIH system is a payment system&#13;
similar to the US Medicare system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Hospitals receive&#13;
a lump-sum amount covering all services per case or episode of illness. The payment units&#13;
are set according to a list of fixed prices based on costs modified by certain patient&#13;
characteristics and illness severity factors that influence costs. University hospitals receive&#13;
an additional 50 percent to compensate for the extra costs of training and research and to&#13;
cover for the great number of severe cases. However, the Government has failed to make&#13;
good estimates of health care costs and has therefore been forced to set the price of&#13;
different SIHs on the basis of political negotiations and the relative strength of different&#13;
interest groups.  Public and private providers collect the same reimbursement for&#13;
equivalent SIHs and ambulatory procedures, but public hospitals have a huge advantage&#13;
since salaries are paid directly by municipalities, states, or the Federal government.&#13;
12.   A number of hospital admission authorizations (SIHs) are transferred to states and&#13;
municipalities. In 1995, each state could authorize hospitalizations up to a number equal&#13;
to 9 percent of its population. This ceiling had been reduced earlier that year, from 10&#13;
percent of the population, when the Government established severe cost-containment and&#13;
rationing measures, including the establishment of global budgets for states and&#13;
municipalities. In 1996, the GoB plans to limit the number of hospital admissions even&#13;
6The collection of these contributions has been very inefficient. IPEA estimates that, in 1992. the level of&#13;
evasion to the COFINS contribution was around 76 percent. The end of the hyperinflation period led&#13;
to a sharp improvement in the collection of COFINS and CSLP contributions, but not in the revenues&#13;
from payroll deductions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
further, to 8 per 100 population, a significant 20 percent reduction from the 1994 values&#13;
and a rate of admissions which is much lower than the average for a country with&#13;
demographic profile such as that of Brazil (10-12 admission per 100 population per year).&#13;
13.   Public funds for investment in rehabilitation and equipment are transferred to&#13;
States as UCRs (Network Rehabilitation Units), in an amount equivalent to 1-5 percent&#13;
of the sum received in UCAs. Such funds, which should be transferred automatically on&#13;
the basis of transparent criteria, have been allocated on the basis of individual agreements&#13;
between the Minister of Health and State Governors or Municipal Mayors. Municipalities&#13;
that are willing to allocate 10 percent of their budget to the health sector and are willing to&#13;
comply with the other legal requirements for autonomy receive an Incentive to&#13;
Municipalization equivalent to 5 percent of their UCA allocation. Many municipalities,&#13;
however, have difficulties in allocating 10 percent of their revenues to the health sector&#13;
and, therefore, the number of municipalities benefiting from UCRs is relatively small.&#13;
14.   Over the years, the value of AlHs and UCAs has sharply declined because of&#13;
inflation and lack of adequate price adjustment. Presently, it is estimated that they cover&#13;
no more than 40 to 50 percent of real costs. Between 1991 and 1992, the average price of&#13;
an AIH fell from US$306 to US$180. Furthermore, the deterioration of prices has been&#13;
uneven across procedures and diagnosis. This distortion affects the reimbursement of&#13;
essential clinical and public health services, while less cost-effective tertiary care has been&#13;
relatively more protected. In addition, it provides a perverse cross-subsidy since the upper&#13;
and the upper middle class use costly tertiary care disproportionately.&#13;
15.   The deterioration of prices has led hospitals and other providers to adopt several&#13;
strategies to stay in business. They tend to: (a) postpone investments in rehabilitation and&#13;
equipment; (b) cut maintenance; (c) request illegal co-payments from patients; (d) tinker&#13;
fraudulently with patient diagnosis to maximize reimbursement; (c) request more than one&#13;
AIH  reimbursement for each admission; and (d) falsify admissions.  Though the&#13;
Government has a good information system to detect fraud, it has been unable to enforce&#13;
the law. The GoB fears that enforcing the law without adequate reimbursements would&#13;
cause massive closings and service disruption. This is a key issue for the viability of the&#13;
project and would be at the heart of the reform to be supported by the project.&#13;
16.   In addition to the SUS system, the private health insurance sector plays a&#13;
significant complementary role in the financing and delivery of health services. In&#13;
1987, 24 million people were covered by one of the several schemes provided under&#13;
private health insurance, which represented then a US$1.9 billion industry; in 1994, it&#13;
already covered 38 million people (54 percent increase) and represented a US$6.6 billion&#13;
industry (a 260 percent increase). The rapid growth of private health care insurance can&#13;
explained by several factors: (a) the quality of care offered by the public system declined&#13;
sharply due to years of underfinancing; (b) large companies, often with a oligopolistic&#13;
market position, were able to pass the costs of employee health insurance over to prices,&#13;
and ultimately to consumers; (c) families got tax breaks for every dollar spent in private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
health insurance; and (d) extreme social stratification offered health insurers opportunities&#13;
to tailor their products to different groups, including highly lucrative upscale schemes.&#13;
15.   Complementary insurance schemes, which are poorly regulated and monitored,&#13;
include group medicine, medical cooperatives, private health insurance, and company-&#13;
based health services.  Group medicine systems and company-based systems are the&#13;
largest private operators both in terms of coverage and revenues. Private insurance&#13;
systems are the fastest growing group. Prices of private insurance schemes are far higher&#13;
than those charged under the SUS. This happens despite the fact that most systems do not&#13;
offer comprehensive coverage: (a) coverage often does not include prevention, chronic&#13;
diseases and catastrophic expenses, and (b) high-risk or sick applicants or members are&#13;
often rejected or excluded, respectively. Company-based systems are the most expensive&#13;
at US$250 per person covered per year, followed by medical cooperatives at US$206.&#13;
Private health insurance and group medicine systems offer the cheapest private health care&#13;
coverage with US$156 and US$131 per person covered per year, respectively.&#13;

0. ALLOCATION OF REFORSUS INVESTMENT CEILINGS BY STATE&#13;
1.    REFORSUS  will finance  investments under a decentralized, competitive&#13;
arrangement in which states, municipalities and philanthropic providers submit proposals&#13;
for sub-projects. This procedure runs the risk that some states, with a greater capacity to&#13;
generate proposals, would end up getting too large a share of the funds, leaving too little&#13;
for states which were slower to submit proposals. To avoid this, the total fund available&#13;
for investment will be pre-allocated among the states, establishing an initial ceiling for each&#13;
state. A state will not automatically receive that much money; instead the ceiling will&#13;
reserve those funds to be invested if there are enough acceptable sub-project proposals to&#13;
absorb them. If the ceiling for a particular state is not reached during the life of the&#13;
project, despite technical assistance from the Ministry in preparing sub-projects, the&#13;
unused funds can be reallocated to other states which still have acceptable proposals&#13;
pending.&#13;
2.    A formula for the state-by-state pre-allocation of funds has been agreed. This&#13;
formula:&#13;
(a)    Allocates not less than half the total investment fund in proportion to&#13;
population, in order to be consistent with the rule that at least 50 percent of recurrent SUS&#13;
expenditures be allocated by population;&#13;
(b)    Takes into account, in order to allocate the rest of the funds not strictly&#13;
proportional to population, one or more variables associated with greater needs for&#13;
investment, such as health status, poverty, or the current pattern of SUS expenditure; and&#13;
(c)   Is transpare'nt and easy to explain and justify to state and municipal&#13;
officials, directors of health facilities, and the public.&#13;
3.    The first two of these requirements are satisfied by the general class of formulas&#13;
Fe/F = a(Pe/P) + (1-a)(Xe/X), where&#13;
e refers to a particular state (estado)&#13;
F is the investment fund to be pre-allocated&#13;
P is population&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
a is a parameter to be chosen, subject to the restriction that it be less than 1.0 and&#13;
greater than or equal to 0.5 (1 &gt; a &gt; 0.5), and&#13;
X is an indicator of need for additional investment (beyond that associated with&#13;
population alone), which may be a single variable or a function of several variables..&#13;
4.    In order for the formula never to take away from  a state, part of the ceiling&#13;
distributed according to population, Xe must be non-negative. A zero value implies that&#13;
the state gets no more funds than it is entitled to on the basis of population alone--that is,&#13;
it is already a favored state. In addition, in order for the formula to allocate all of F&#13;
exactly, without further adjustment, it is necessary for X to be the sum of the Xe across all&#13;
the states, just as P is the sum of the state populations, Pe. With this condition, summing&#13;
the formula across states yields&#13;
F = aP + (1-a)X,&#13;
so that a is exactly the share of the total fund allocated according to population,&#13;
and (1-a) is the share allocated according to X. The restriction that the Xe add up to total&#13;
X means that X cannot he a ratio or other non-linear function of whatever variables are&#13;
used to compose it. (Ratios can nonetheless be used in the constructiotn of X.)&#13;
5.     To satisfy the third requirement, that the formula be comprehensible and politically&#13;
acceptable, imposes other, less exact, restrictions on the indicator X. It must be based on&#13;
variables that can be measured without ambiguity, and it should not involve any&#13;
complicated calculations.&#13;
6.     The Ministry thinks that X should be based on SUS recurrent expenditures (G for&#13;
gasto ), because:&#13;
(a)    It is under the Ministry's control&#13;
(b)    Expenditure should already bear some relation to other variables which&#13;
might be used to construct X, such as the prevalence of poverty in the state or the size and&#13;
nature of the burden of disease,&#13;
(c)    Data on expenditure by state are unambiguous and publicly available; and&#13;
(d)    Since state officials are always likely to claim that their state does not get&#13;
enough funds, what is needed is simply a measure of what is "enough".&#13;
7.     Discussion among the Ministry, the Inter-American Development Bank and the&#13;
World Bank ended with agreement on the following construction of the indicator X:&#13;
8.     First, per capita expenditure Ge/Pe is calculated in each state. The highest value is&#13;
denoted (G/P)m.  (m  indicates the state where the ratio is maximal--it does not&#13;
necessarily mean the state with the highest expenditure or the highest population.  m&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94&#13;
happens at present to refer to Parana; per capita expenditure is only slightly lower in Sao&#13;
Paulo.)&#13;
9.    Next, the ratio (G/P)m is multiplied by Pe, the population of state e: this creates&#13;
the variable&#13;
Gem =(GJP)m(Pe)&#13;
which is what expenditure in state e would be if per capita spending there were as&#13;
high as in the state with the most expenditure per person--for example, how much SUS&#13;
would spend in Para if the expenditure per head in that state were the same as in Parana.&#13;
The sum of the Gem over all the states is denoted Gm: it is the amount that would be&#13;
spent in all of Brazil if the per capita expenditure were everywhere as high as in Parana.&#13;
Then actual expenditure Ge is subtracted from this estimate of maximal&#13;
expenditure to yield&#13;
Xe = Gem - Ge&#13;
which means that Xe can be interpreted as a kind of "gap" or shortfall of&#13;
expenditure in state e compared to state m. Clearly,&#13;
Xm = 0 (State m, being the most favored already, has no shortfall to make up and&#13;
therefore is not entitled to any more investment funds than are distributed according to&#13;
population alone);&#13;
Xe&gt; 0 for every other state e (So no state has any money taken away, that was&#13;
already assigned according to population); and&#13;
The sum of the Xe is equal to X, which is the total shortfall in the whole country,&#13;
or the amount of additional expenditure that would be needed in order to raise per capita&#13;
spending everywhere to the level in the state (Parana) where it is highest now.&#13;
10.   The final formula is then&#13;
Fe/F = a(Pe/P) + (1-a)(Gem - Ge)/(Gm - G)&#13;
I.   Several possible complications to this formula were received. For example, the&#13;
need for medical care is not simply proportional to population but depends on the age&#13;
distribution, so it is arguable that Pe should somehow be adjusted for age composition.&#13;
However, this would make the formula for investment allocation differ from the pure&#13;
population basis on which part of recurrent spending is assigned. And since there is no&#13;
one way to "adjust" for age distribution, this would cause more argument over the formula&#13;
and make it harder to accept politically. Similarly, Ge might be complicated by including&#13;
state or municipal as well as federal expenditures, or in other ways. But that would take&#13;
the variable out of the control of the Ministry, would make it less transparent, and might&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95&#13;
even create a perverse incentive for a state to spend less of its own resources in order to&#13;
claim a larger share of the REFORSUS investment funds. None of the possible subtleties&#13;
or complications to the formula appeared to improve it sufficiently in technical terms, to&#13;
justify the consequent ambiguities and political difficulties.&#13;
12.   The parameter a is necessarily arbitrary, since the only requirement is that it lie&#13;
between 0.5 and 1.0 The Banks and the Ministry agreed that it should fall somewhere in&#13;
the middle of that range, so that Xe, the expenditure-related indicator, can actually have&#13;
some impact on the allocation of funds, but not so much as to make the allocation depart&#13;
greatly from proportionality to population. A value of a = 0.7 appears satisfactory: 70&#13;
percent of the ceiling allocated according to population and 30 percent according to&#13;
expenditure shortfall.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Health Sector
            Reform Project (REFORSUS) are to: 1) improve the delivery of
            care under the Sistema Unico de Saude/Unified Health System
            (SUS), which is the sole source of publicly subsidized care
            for the poor; and 2) assist the government in introducing
            policy reforms which would improve the financial
            sustainability and efficiency of the SUS. The project will
            finance the following two components: 1) an investment fund
            to finance rehabilitation, equipment, management and
            maintenance subprojects; and 2) institutional development,
            which will support: an adequate framework for pricing and
            reimbursing health care providers; a list of priority health
            benefits to be financed by the SUS; a differentiated
            reimbursement schedule favoring more cost-effective
            interventions; the introduction of cost recovery for care
            provided to privately-insured patients under the SUS; and
            better management of the quality of services and fraud control.
