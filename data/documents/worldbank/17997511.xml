&amp;#12;                Interview with Wayne Rayfield&#13;
                        The World Bank&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Good afternoon.       Today is November 21, 1994.      My name is&#13;
&#13;
Charles Ziegler, of the World Bank Group Archives.&#13;
&#13;
     I'm David Milobsky, from the World Bank Group&#13;
&#13;
Historian's office.&#13;
&#13;
     And I'm Wayne Rayfield, from Organization Business&#13;
&#13;
Planning (OBP), the new department that's involved with&#13;
&#13;
computing and the use of technology.&#13;
                                                     k~&#13;
Q:   We are interviewing Wayne Rayfield,         who-~had   a long and&#13;
&#13;
distinguished career in the Bank in the area of information&#13;
&#13;
management and technology.         Wayne, thanks for being here with&#13;
&#13;
us today.&#13;
&#13;
A:   You are most welcome, Chuck.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you please say something about your career before&#13;
&#13;
you came to the Bank, and then recount the circumstances&#13;
                               ~   -&#13;
under which you joined the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I joined the Bank fr0m the University of Wisconsin,&#13;
                       I&#13;
where I had worked for six years at the Computing Center&#13;
&#13;
there on the Madison campus.           When I left I was Director of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
the Computing Center, and I've been in computing since l957,&#13;
&#13;
trained as an engineer, in Engineering Geophysics.     I started&#13;
&#13;
in computing with The Rand Corporation in Santa Monica,&#13;
&#13;
California, and I arrived at the Bank around l970-71,&#13;
&#13;
because, as I understand it, Mr. McNamara, the President of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank then, felt that computing and technology was not&#13;
&#13;
getting enough attention.   It was a function in the&#13;
&#13;
administration department, and he was instrumental in the&#13;
&#13;
formation of something called the Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
Department {CAD) .&#13;
&#13;
     I was one of the few people who were recruited early on,&#13;
&#13;
the primary person being Mervin Muller, who was recruited as&#13;
&#13;
the Director of the new department.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you describe something about the state of&#13;
&#13;
mainframe data processing, on one hand, and office&#13;
&#13;
technology, on the. other, when you arrived at the Bank?    In&#13;
&#13;
particular, how did this relationship change over time, and&#13;
&#13;
how, if at all, the developments in one area complement or&#13;
&#13;
enhance developments in the other?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
A:   It was very easy to deal with the question of office&#13;
&#13;
technology, because it was virtually non-existent in 1971.&#13;
&#13;
     Mainframe computing was interesting because at that time&#13;
&#13;
the Bank really was doing data processing on two forms of&#13;
&#13;
technology.   The first form was electronic accounting&#13;
&#13;
machines, the precursors of computing to some degree, punch-&#13;
&#13;
card accounting, as it 1 s referred to.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That started in 1961.    I have an old Bank Notes article&#13;
&#13;
on the subject.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Something like that.    And there was, when I arrived&#13;
&#13;
here, one person who knew how to wire the accounting machine&#13;
&#13;
boards, and they were programmed by physically changing wires&#13;
&#13;
on a very complex board, and much of the Bankâ&#128;¢s financial&#13;
&#13;
work at that time, in fact just about all of it, was done&#13;
&#13;
through electronic accounting machines.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank also shared in _the use of a computer, a&#13;
&#13;
Burroughs B-5000, with the Fund.    This was the first shared&#13;
&#13;
computing arrangement, as far as I know, between the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
the Fund.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
     The primary application that the Bank had at that time&#13;
&#13;
was the external debt application, so that socioeconomic data&#13;
&#13;
was kept on the 5000.   And, as I said earlier, the operation&#13;
&#13;
of that computer system was part of the Administration&#13;
&#13;
Department, and there were computer programmers, systems&#13;
&#13;
analysists in other departments, External Debt being one.&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara's view, as I understand it, was that he&#13;
&#13;
recognized the growing importance of computing.     I think his&#13;
&#13;
emphasis at that time was on analytical uses of computing to&#13;
&#13;
support the Bank's work, and he felt that the Bank needed a&#13;
&#13;
quantum jump in its professional expertise in this area, and&#13;
&#13;
much more attention.    I think part of his view stemmed from&#13;
&#13;
the fact that there were many people in the Bank who felt&#13;
&#13;
that computing facilities were inadequate for the institution&#13;
&#13;
at that time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And McNamara was something of a numbers man.&#13;
                            ~-   -&#13;
A:   Yeah.   He was, and very analytical, but he also wanted&#13;
&#13;
to see tables, and the mythology has it that he'd go over&#13;
&#13;
every table presented to him with a fine tooth comb and if,&#13;
&#13;
for example, the column of percentages didn't add up to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Rayfield, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
exactly 100, back it would go.      So he was very attentive to&#13;
&#13;
detail, very analytical.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You did mention office technology as non-existent.         I&#13;
&#13;
suppose that was still during the time when they had these&#13;
&#13;
IBM Selectric typewriters and--&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     If we consider the electric typewriter, I guess,&#13;
&#13;
fair enough, thatâ&#128;¢s a form of technology.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, it is pre-PC.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     Certainly pre-PC.   This is 1971.   And the PC&#13;
&#13;
really didn't appear on the scene until the early â&#128;¢aos, and&#13;
&#13;
then only in rare places.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you describe something of the organizational&#13;
&#13;
evolution and personalities involved in the work of the&#13;
&#13;
Computing Activities Department, in particular who resisted&#13;
&#13;
and who supported the establishment of such a department?&#13;
&#13;
Part of the question was to ask whether Mr. McNamara was&#13;
                             ~-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
supportive, but you, of course, have already pretty much said&#13;
&#13;
that he was.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.     He was very supportive, and the department which&#13;
&#13;
was formed around July 1971, coincided with the start of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
new fiscal year, this function of computing was split off&#13;
&#13;
from administrative services.&#13;
&#13;
     One of the strongest personalities in the whole thing,&#13;
&#13;
of course, was the Director, Merv Muller, who also had been&#13;
&#13;
at the University of Wisconsin.      And in those days, the&#13;
&#13;
department was, in addition to being a service provider,&#13;
&#13;
strongly oriented towards control, so that in fact all&#13;
&#13;
computer applications were done centrally, with a few&#13;
&#13;
exceptions, like the External Debt perhaps, were done&#13;
&#13;
centrally, and the computer hardware was operated centrally,&#13;
&#13;
and the budgets for computing were justified centrally by the&#13;
&#13;
department, which was the cause of a lot of problems.         And,&#13;
&#13;
applications were developed for all the business units in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank centrally.&#13;
&#13;
     So even though the formation of a Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
Department (CAD), was intended to bring in a lot of expertise&#13;
                           '-.   -&#13;
that the Bank didn't have, and in fact did bring in a lot of&#13;
&#13;
expertise, it was, as was common across the industry then, a&#13;
&#13;
central department intended to do most everything in the&#13;
&#13;
computing area for most everyone.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Rayfield, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
     It was placed under Hollis Chenery, who was the Vice&#13;
&#13;
President for Development Economics.       Hollis was a marvelous&#13;
&#13;
individual, more interested in how computers might be used&#13;
&#13;
for economic analysis, modeling, simulation, and the like,&#13;
&#13;
and less interested in the management of the computing&#13;
&#13;
department as a manager, so much of this was left to Merv&#13;
&#13;
Muller, who came with considerable credentials in this area,&#13;
&#13;
in any case.&#13;
&#13;
     The environment then, I think, was one of great&#13;
&#13;
expectations, the creation of a new department focusing on an&#13;
&#13;
area that many people in the Bank felt had been woefully&#13;
&#13;
ignored over the preceding years certainly.      There was great&#13;
&#13;
competition for the departmentâ&#128;¢s resources by the business&#13;
&#13;
units outside of the department, particularly in the area of&#13;
&#13;
systems development, applications systems development.       The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -&#13;
departments had a lot of latent demands or needs for&#13;
                             .......&#13;
                                   ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
computer-based systems, all of which, to one degree or&#13;
&#13;
another, had to be designed, thought through in terms of&#13;
&#13;
functionality, programmed, tested, and then maintained and&#13;
&#13;
supported.     So the departmental resources involved in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
applications programming were, first of all, very small in&#13;
&#13;
1971, and there was considerable demand for them.&#13;
&#13;
        This led, in this situation of considerable demands and&#13;
&#13;
little resources to fill the demands, to the establishment of&#13;
&#13;
something called the Computer Priorities Committee in late&#13;
&#13;
1971.    TheÂ· idea of this committee was fun:   briefly, that it&#13;
&#13;
was to be a committee of senior Bank managers who would&#13;
&#13;
allocate the very scarce resources of staff resources of the&#13;
&#13;
computing activities department into the development and&#13;
&#13;
support of new applications.&#13;
&#13;
        That committee had a very short life, in part I think&#13;
&#13;
because it quickly turned into discussions of pretty high&#13;
&#13;
technical nature, and the initial complement of Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents, including Hollis and myself, felt uncomfortable&#13;
&#13;
in dealing with the level of detail.     So there was an&#13;
&#13;
informal subcommittee formed, which had a long and useful&#13;
                             ~.   -&#13;
life, called The Subcommittee for Computing Priorities, but&#13;
&#13;
it really was the group that set and dealt with competing&#13;
&#13;
priorities from different business units and, advised the&#13;
&#13;
Director on matters of priorities, but Merv, the Director,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
always, or 90 percent of the time, anyway, followed this&#13;
&#13;
guidance.&#13;
&#13;
        This committee was chaired by Jim Kearns who did an&#13;
&#13;
outstanding job in bringing disparate views and disparate&#13;
&#13;
perspectives on computing somehow together, and stepped into&#13;
&#13;
a void that he continued to fill for close to ten years in&#13;
&#13;
terms of chairing this committee or being involved with&#13;
&#13;
matters.&#13;
&#13;
        Other people on the subcommittee, or the committee, as&#13;
&#13;
it was really known, were John Blaxhall, Heinz Burdine(?)&#13;
&#13;
Q:      How were they selected for this committee?   How did you&#13;
&#13;
get to be a member of the subcommittee?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I think they were selected as representatives of&#13;
&#13;
areas within the Bank that had needs, and for some reason&#13;
&#13;
they were in a position of having to deal with these needs,&#13;
&#13;
or alternatively, their opinion was felt to be important.&#13;
                             ~.   ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, John at the time was in PBD, or P&amp;B.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      John Blaxhall?&#13;
&#13;
A:.     John Blaxhall was really reflecting the, the budgetary&#13;
&#13;
side.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, we are talking about 1971-727&#13;
&#13;
A:      And the three or four years after that. This&#13;
&#13;
subcommittee lasted well into the late '70s.     Their main&#13;
&#13;
function was to allocate systems development resources to the&#13;
&#13;
varying and various competing user areas.     They also dealt&#13;
&#13;
with matters of computer or, at that time, mainframe capacity&#13;
&#13;
and--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Then we are still talking of mainframe computers here,&#13;
&#13;
we are really using office technology?&#13;
&#13;
A:      We are still talking, there is no office technology as&#13;
&#13;
such.     In fact, the office technology doesn't begin to rear&#13;
&#13;
its head until the late '70s with word processing, dedicated&#13;
&#13;
or point systems for word processing.&#13;
&#13;
        As I said, most of the committee's or the subcommittee's&#13;
&#13;
attention was on application development, but there is some&#13;
&#13;
time spent on computer capacity, because as we started&#13;
                             '~   -&#13;
weaving CAD, we started doing systems development work and&#13;
&#13;
started to deliver some systems or maintain them, and people&#13;
&#13;
started using new capabilities, machine cycles or time on the&#13;
&#13;
computer was used more and more often, and the capacity of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Rayfield, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
that small machine, I say   11&#13;
                                 small 11 because all the desktops in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank today have more computing capacity on them&#13;
&#13;
individually than the machine by the Bank and Fund together.&#13;
&#13;
It's an interesting comparison.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And that's a big mainframe at the time.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I know it's a big mainframe.        Yeah.   Located in, as I&#13;
&#13;
recall, it was D-100, or in the corridor that existed between&#13;
&#13;
the A and the B, along with the telephone switch and some&#13;
&#13;
other things.   So that was the Bank's first computing center&#13;
&#13;
as well, which we quickly outgrew.        The accounting machines&#13;
&#13;
were in that same area, and much of the staff.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was that considered the JCC at the time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   That was called the JCC, Joint Computing Center.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, we'll get to the Joint Computing Center in a&#13;
&#13;
moment.   You mentioned the budgets were justified centrally&#13;
&#13;
and that caused problems. Could&#13;
                          ..... __ -&#13;
                                     you say just a bit more about&#13;
&#13;
how that was difficult?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Sure.   The Central Department would have a set of&#13;
&#13;
demands or needs from various units, whether they be in&#13;
&#13;
Finance or Operations or wherever.        And, the Central&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
Department was expected to make the cost-benefit argument as&#13;
&#13;
to why a particular system might be needed by the Treasurer's&#13;
&#13;
or by Operations or whatever, and it was just impossible to&#13;
&#13;
do that, because it's clearly the business unit that needs to&#13;
&#13;
make the case on benefits, on how an application would&#13;
&#13;
contribute to their business function, and why whatever cost&#13;
&#13;
is involved is an appropriate cost to pay for this.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Central Department being--&#13;
&#13;
A:   Being Computing Activities.   So, in a sense, we were&#13;
&#13;
between a rock and a hard place, P&amp;B on one hand, and&#13;
&#13;
properly expecting justification for costs which--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Which they expected you to supply even though you were&#13;
&#13;
the ones asking?&#13;
&#13;
A:   They expected the Center, yeah.    So it was pretty much a&#13;
&#13;
no-win situation.    In fact, P&amp;B would look at even such&#13;
&#13;
things as the number of pa~~~ being printed on the computer&#13;
&#13;
printers, monthly or annually, and say, "Oh, why are you&#13;
&#13;
printing so much?"   Of course, it wasn't the Central&#13;
&#13;
Department doing this.    It was the various line units making&#13;
&#13;
use of computing.    But there was this tension, then, between&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
the budget and trying to connect expenditures, as it didnâ&#128;¢t&#13;
&#13;
work very well with a central department trying to do&#13;
&#13;
everything.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who were your heaviest users?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, at that time, the heaviest user at the very&#13;
&#13;
beginning was External Debt.    Now, as we began getting into&#13;
&#13;
the development of applications, the group that could best&#13;
&#13;
articulate their demands and make the best business case for&#13;
&#13;
what they needed to do, and had the best understanding of the&#13;
&#13;
processes or the functions involved with what they had to do,&#13;
&#13;
was the Finance complex.   So, the Finance complex quickly&#13;
&#13;
became the largest user as various applications were&#13;
&#13;
developed to support Finance.   And, in fact, 80-90 percent of&#13;
&#13;
the system development resources, as I recall, were going&#13;
&#13;
into the financial applications, such things as currency&#13;
&#13;
pooling, and any variety of things.    Every time some new&#13;
&#13;
policies would be identified, for example, or, a new Bank&#13;
&#13;
instrument, this had a major impact on Finance, which had a&#13;
&#13;
major impact on systems, and so they were indeed   ~    main&#13;
&#13;
user, followed by External Debt, and then to a lesser degree&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
perhaps Personnel, as the notion of a personnel system, a&#13;
&#13;
staff locator system or whatever, ultimately involved into&#13;
&#13;
the HRIC, the Human Resources Information Center.&#13;
&#13;
     Operations had a lot of needs, and were totally&#13;
&#13;
frustrated by this system for years, as the Operations&#13;
&#13;
business functions were not as well formulated, and the needs&#13;
&#13;
for information were not as well understood, so Operations,&#13;
&#13;
unfortunately, got very little attention.     There were some&#13;
&#13;
packages developed for Operations, one of the more notable&#13;
&#13;
was called Cross-Tab, which was developed outside of&#13;
&#13;
computing activities by a fellow by the name of Gordon&#13;
&#13;
Temple.    But these were small tools that would help small&#13;
&#13;
segments of Operations.     People from Operations really felt&#13;
&#13;
very neglected in terms of the deliberations of the&#13;
&#13;
Priorities Committee and the resources allocated to their&#13;
&#13;
needs.&#13;
                             '~   -&#13;
Q:   Who would decide on who would receive the applications?&#13;
&#13;
Was that your department?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.    It was the Subcommittee of Computing Priorities,&#13;
&#13;
or, they at least provided the advice which we pretty much&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Rayfield, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
followed and, for all practical purposes 100 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      In 1974, you supervised the     11&#13;
                                             Study of the Present and&#13;
&#13;
Future Computing Needs of the Bank and the Fund.           11   What were&#13;
&#13;
the major conclusions and, from a perspective of 20 years&#13;
&#13;
later, how have those conclusions stood up?&#13;
&#13;
A:      The study was in the early '70s, when the Fund was 1n&#13;
&#13;
the process of building their new building--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Which was finished in '73.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah.   Right.   The Fund had decided to build, or&#13;
&#13;
incorporate in their new building a computer room, and they&#13;
&#13;
felt that they probably ought to have a computer in there to&#13;
&#13;
fill this room.      So, as the building neared readiness, the&#13;
&#13;
Fund thought that the Joint Computing Center wasn't cost-&#13;
&#13;
effective for them, and that they might like to get their own&#13;
&#13;
system and break the partnership&#13;
                           .........&#13;
                                _ .._&#13;
                                     with the Bank in this area .&#13;
&#13;
        Now, by this time the Joint Bank-Fund system had grown&#13;
&#13;
somewhat, fairly considerably, because the Fund, like the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, had brought on a number of new applications and more&#13;
&#13;
uses of the computer.       So the study that I supervised, and I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
don't know that I so much supervised as did it, was really to&#13;
&#13;
look at what are the implications of either a continued joint&#13;
&#13;
operation or two separate operations and, the final&#13;
&#13;
conclusion was that it was much more cost-effective for both&#13;
&#13;
organizations to continue a joint operation.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, the Fund had some concerns or perceptions that&#13;
&#13;
their needs, interests were not adequately reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
way in which the JCC, Joint Computing Center, was operated,&#13;
&#13;
so both organizations thought the results of the study were&#13;
&#13;
appropriate but we coupled that with a recognition of the&#13;
&#13;
need to change some management activities.&#13;
&#13;
        In those days, or preceding those days, most of the&#13;
&#13;
computer work was submitted via punch cards, and people would&#13;
&#13;
run down to the Computing Center with their deck of cards to&#13;
&#13;
have their program run, and there was always a queue as the&#13;
&#13;
machine resources became stressed and the work backed up.        So&#13;
                             '~   -&#13;
we had a priority system in place whereby each organization&#13;
&#13;
had a certain allotment of red cards which you could use to&#13;
&#13;
get a job run immediately.        This was called the Priority&#13;
&#13;
Card.     And one of the complaints of the Fund was that they&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
thought that they had an unfair number of red cards, that&#13;
&#13;
they ought to have more.    There were issues like this that&#13;
&#13;
fundamentally involved the degree of attention and workload.&#13;
&#13;
And, certainly as the Bank grew, something had to give, and&#13;
&#13;
the Fund probably at times got service that wasn't as good as&#13;
&#13;
they needed.   I think the reverse was also true.&#13;
&#13;
     But, in any case, the study showed that it was cost-&#13;
&#13;
effective to continue a joint arrangement, which is what we&#13;
&#13;
did, and then the Joint Computing Center, with the completion&#13;
&#13;
of the Fund building in 1973 moved into it.    We didn't move&#13;
&#13;
anything in D-100 because I think right around then we&#13;
&#13;
upgraded the machine so the new machine, which was a follow-&#13;
&#13;
on model to the Burroughs machine that the Bank had at that&#13;
&#13;
time, went into the Fund.   And that was it.&#13;
&#13;
     One other point that I should make in terms of these&#13;
&#13;
resources, in the early '70s .McNamara had the view that&#13;
                            '~   -&#13;
computing was strictly a cost item, a line in the cost&#13;
&#13;
element in the budget, not necessarily a value-added, and it&#13;
&#13;
was unclear how to manage this cost.    His view was that the&#13;
&#13;
computing budget should be no more than two percent of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
overall administrative budget of the Bank, and he therefore&#13;
&#13;
arbitrarily set the budget for computing at two percent,&#13;
&#13;
virtually independent of the needs.     This is one of the&#13;
&#13;
reasons why a Computer Priority Committee was so necessary&#13;
&#13;
then, the alternative being having the Director of the&#13;
&#13;
department make all the priority calls, which didn't make a&#13;
&#13;
lot of sense.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you say that the results of your study, that is to&#13;
&#13;
say the continuation of the JCC operations between the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and the Fund sÂ·tood the test of time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.   I think so.   I think it was clearly a cost-saver&#13;
&#13;
to those organizations.    Those organizations were able to&#13;
&#13;
mature.   It would have been an incredibly expensive venture&#13;
&#13;
for both to break that tie, and I think we both profited from&#13;
&#13;
each other's experience.    If there is a lesson to learn, I&#13;
&#13;
think it's that we could have learned a lot more.     We were&#13;
                            'Â·.-&#13;
not collaborating on the applications side.     So,&#13;
&#13;
fundamentally, the JCC was run like a service bureau, but&#13;
&#13;
both organizations were rediscovering the wheel on some&#13;
&#13;
common applications, like payroll or personnel systems, that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Rayfield, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
were being developed by each.       And in fact we could, I'm not&#13;
&#13;
suggesting we should have had one personnel system for both&#13;
&#13;
organizations, but certainly we could have learned from each&#13;
&#13;
other much more than we did.        Whatever learning was done&#13;
&#13;
happened to be because the individuals working on a similar&#13;
&#13;
system in both organizations were friendly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The one thing I have noticed also is that a lot of the&#13;
&#13;
growth of activity in this area seemed to coincide with&#13;
&#13;
larger structural reorganization of the Bank itself.        Was&#13;
&#13;
there any sort of relationship between what you were doing&#13;
&#13;
and the Bank's attempts to renovate itself during this&#13;
&#13;
period, or, in relationship to the kind of demands that maybe&#13;
&#13;
your office got or the kinds of things that people wanted you&#13;
&#13;
to do?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, in terms of demands, yeah, the organizations or&#13;
&#13;
changes in organizations generally had an impact on systems&#13;
                           ~~   -&#13;
and, unfortunately, the way it happened was that it was&#13;
&#13;
always an afterthought.   So rather than thinking up front&#13;
&#13;
that, if we make this organizational change it is going to&#13;
&#13;
have an implication on the payroll, or even a change in those&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
days on decisions on salary increases that had an impact on&#13;
&#13;
the systems, never seemed to be looked at up front.      It was&#13;
&#13;
always after the fact.&#13;
&#13;
     But, unlike today, technology or computing was not&#13;
&#13;
thought of as a change enabler or change agent.      Again,&#13;
&#13;
computing was a backroom function that didn't add new&#13;
&#13;
capabilities, it simply enabled you to do things more&#13;
&#13;
effectively or efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What about those allocation issues that you were&#13;
&#13;
describing before, did the 1972 reorganization in effect&#13;
&#13;
cause you any headaches perhaps, or affect the way these were&#13;
&#13;
handled?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I don't know.   We may have had some proponents for&#13;
&#13;
certain systems to move around and in that sense it may have,&#13;
&#13;
but actually I don't recall any dramatic change, not that&#13;
&#13;
there might not have been one.      I just don't recall it.&#13;
                           '~   -&#13;
Q:   Well, just to round out this part of the discussion&#13;
&#13;
regarding the Joint Computing Center, how would you&#13;
&#13;
characterize the relationship between the Bank and the Fund&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Rayfield, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
in running the JCC, in a nutshell?             Friendly?    Cooperative?&#13;
&#13;
Or hostile and confrontational?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Good question.   I don't know that I can categorize it in&#13;
&#13;
a word.   And I think one would have to look at it from each&#13;
&#13;
organization's or even people's perspective.               The people in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank made, I believe, an extensive effort to treat the&#13;
&#13;
Fund equally with the Bank, even though we were all Bank&#13;
&#13;
staff except for a few and, we actually did some transfers&#13;
&#13;
between the Bank and the Fund to get some Fund staff in&#13;
&#13;
relatively senior technical positions in the JCC.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So most of the staff in the JCC were Bank people?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.   An important point.            Then, in the mid-'70s, maybe&#13;
&#13;
'74, we decided to continue the arrangement and some of the&#13;
&#13;
Fund people moved into the Joint Computing Center staff. So&#13;
&#13;
from the perspective of the CAD people on the JCC, everyone,&#13;
&#13;
certainly myself included, really believed that we did&#13;
                           ....... ~.   -&#13;
everything we could to treat the Fund equally.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, the people in the Fund who were responsible for&#13;
&#13;
computing held a different view, and felt that a lot more&#13;
&#13;
could have been done to meet their needs.             I know that the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Rayfield, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
Fund Treasury people were strong supporters of the Joint&#13;
&#13;
Computing Center concept.    The Bureau of Statistics was also&#13;
&#13;
a supporter, but probably less so than the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
     I think there were users in the Bank who felt that the&#13;
&#13;
relationship with the Fund was helpful, and there were others&#13;
&#13;
who felt that it got in the way.&#13;
&#13;
     So I don't think you can really characterize in one word&#13;
&#13;
what would apply to everybody.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How long did that relationship last?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It continued in the FRMSH which got started around 1982.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   1984, because that's when the H building opened.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Okay.   That makes sense.        We were working on the&#13;
&#13;
building in '82.   Then the Fund got a new director for their&#13;
&#13;
Bureau of Computing Services somewhere around then, a fellow&#13;
&#13;
by the name of Warren Minami, who, after a year or two after&#13;
&#13;
his arrival, stayed with the joint approach and then felt&#13;
                             '~   -&#13;
that the Fund had reached the point where they really could&#13;
&#13;
use their own computer.     So somewhere in the mid-'80s, the&#13;
&#13;
Fund decided not to continue with the joint operation, and&#13;
&#13;
got their own Burroughs system.         At that time Burroughs had&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
merged with the Univac Corporation and were now Unisys, so&#13;
&#13;
they got a Unisys system, as did the Bank.      The Bank had&#13;
&#13;
other systems, and so did the Fund at this time, but, the&#13;
&#13;
Fund began to operate their own system.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, in the last few years, as you may know, this&#13;
&#13;
situation has changed again, so that somewhere around 1990,&#13;
&#13;
we started negotiations with the Fund again and as the Fund&#13;
&#13;
moved back, we shared the use of the Bank's Burroughs, or&#13;
&#13;
Unisys system at that time, which both organizations were&#13;
&#13;
phasing out, and then the Fund got rid of its IBM system, and&#13;
&#13;
is a user of the Bank's IBM system.      So, we've gone full&#13;
&#13;
cycle on a lot of it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So it was around the mid-'80s that the JCC as such was&#13;
&#13;
phased out?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It ceased to become the Joint Computing Center and&#13;
&#13;
became the Bank's    Computin~ ~enter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Okay.    The first personal computers appeared in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
in 1979.     The IBM PC became available in 1981, and they were&#13;
&#13;
used by higher level staff for analytical work. By 1983,&#13;
&#13;
there were some 300 microcomputers in the Bank.      In 1984, the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
Bank began providing certain support level staff with PCs. By&#13;
&#13;
mid-1987 there were some 3800 IBM PCs or their clones in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, as well as another 600 assorted workstations.      Today it&#13;
&#13;
would be difficult to find a staff member who does not have a&#13;
&#13;
personal computer.   Could you trace some of the major steps&#13;
&#13;
in the development and introduction of office technology in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, office technology in the Bank really got started a&#13;
&#13;
little bit earlier than some of those dates, with at least&#13;
&#13;
one application of office technology, which was word&#13;
&#13;
processing, and could argue that that was one of the&#13;
&#13;
precursors of office technology.      There was also, the use of&#13;
&#13;
mainframes which became rather prevalent in the late '70s&#13;
&#13;
called time-sharing--actually, it was prevalent before that&#13;
&#13;
but it became prevalent in the Bank, where a person had a&#13;
&#13;
terminal on a computer   and,w~uld   use the mainframe computer&#13;
&#13;
from their desk, in a mode similar to having a computer&#13;
&#13;
dedicated to them, when in fact the computer was being shared&#13;
&#13;
among a variety of users.    So that's one of the first steps&#13;
&#13;
to bring at least some form of computing, not very user-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
friendly and not totally under the control of the user, but&#13;
&#13;
some form of computing to the desktop, at least for selected&#13;
&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
     And the other idea was word processing, and at that time&#13;
&#13;
there were a number of vendors producing systems, multi-user&#13;
&#13;
systems to do document creation, word, word processing.       Now,&#13;
&#13;
the responsibility for word processing in the late '70s was&#13;
&#13;
part of the Organization Department.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Organization Planning Department, right?&#13;
&#13;
A:   OPD.   And, the connection with computing wasn't fully&#13;
&#13;
understood, even though of course this was the underlying&#13;
&#13;
technology, the electronic technology.    And so there were a&#13;
&#13;
lot of vendors in the field, but the Bank or OPD, through a&#13;
&#13;
study, decided that three vendors would.be approved for the&#13;
&#13;
use of word processing within the Bank.    They, the vendors,&#13;
&#13;
as I recall, were Wang, NBI, Â·and somebody else.    And the&#13;
                           'Â·   -&#13;
Bank's approach basically to word processing then was to&#13;
&#13;
create units within business units of word processors, around&#13;
&#13;
the technology--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Something like a typing pool.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
A:   Something like a typing pool.    Because here was this&#13;
&#13;
equipment which was so expensive that one had to have it&#13;
&#13;
operated by professionals at maximum efficiency, which led to&#13;
&#13;
the very same problems that computers had in terms of queuing&#13;
&#13;
up, waiting for work, and getting it done.    But anyway,&#13;
&#13;
that's the way we did it, and a lot of organizations did it&#13;
&#13;
that way, so the Bank wasn't alone.   And that continued on&#13;
&#13;
until about the mid-'80s.&#13;
&#13;
     But then personal computers began to appear, and one of&#13;
&#13;
the earlier applications, in addition to spreadsheets, was&#13;
&#13;
word processing, which brought a whole new dimension and&#13;
&#13;
perspective to word processing.   At the same time, people&#13;
&#13;
began seeing the virtues in being able to communicate from a&#13;
&#13;
personal computer, or person to person but using personal&#13;
&#13;
computers.&#13;
&#13;
     By 1981-82, we were clearly beginning to have a mish-&#13;
                            ~-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mash in the Bank.   We had office technology responsibility in&#13;
&#13;
OPD, a technology that was rapidly approaching personal&#13;
&#13;
computers and technology.   We had the explosive growth of&#13;
&#13;
communications globally and locally, more and more needs for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
connecting computers to mainframes, and computers to&#13;
&#13;
computers.    And much of the communications responsibility at&#13;
&#13;
that time was in the Administrative Services Department,&#13;
&#13;
which at that time maintained responsibility for telephones,&#13;
&#13;
telephone and communications wiring, low-voltage wiring&#13;
&#13;
throughout the building, and certainly computing which was ln&#13;
&#13;
CAD.   And there was a fourth dimension, which was&#13;
&#13;
information, because even though over the ten years or so&#13;
&#13;
preceding this point in time, from 1971, say, to 1981, a&#13;
&#13;
number of applications had been developed.    It now became&#13;
&#13;
increasingly clear that what was important in the business&#13;
&#13;
applications was the information, the data base, and often&#13;
&#13;
multiple applications needed to use the same data, and we&#13;
&#13;
were finding lots of occasions when data were duplicated or&#13;
&#13;
when the same data were described differently, or defined&#13;
&#13;
directly, or called the same .thing but entirely different,&#13;
                            ~~   -&#13;
and systems were out of synch.&#13;
&#13;
       So by this time the Bank had a fairly robust mainframe&#13;
&#13;
computing setup, a fairly robust suite of applications&#13;
&#13;
systems, particularly to support Finance and some of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Rayfield, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
administrative functions, not yet supporting Operations, the&#13;
&#13;
use of technology for word processing, and, a growing&#13;
&#13;
awareness of the value in communications as well as a growing&#13;
&#13;
awareness of the value of information.&#13;
&#13;
     So, following the study, which really picked up on an&#13;
&#13;
earlier study, there was a recommendation made that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
adopt what was then called the Information Resource&#13;
&#13;
Management concept, the Bank did adopt that and formed an&#13;
&#13;
Information Resource Management Department which, among other&#13;
&#13;
things, brought more attention to information management,&#13;
&#13;
brought responsibility for office technology and computing&#13;
&#13;
together under one unit, and also brought, rationalized&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities for telecommunications, communications and&#13;
&#13;
computers.&#13;
&#13;
     One of the first activities of that new department, was&#13;
&#13;
to start looking at some standards for office technology&#13;
                           '-   -&#13;
because we were beginning to see a profusion of technologies,&#13;
&#13;
certainly the three word processing systems that were in use.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I think Vydec was the other.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
A:   Vydec was the other, absolutely.   They could not&#13;
&#13;
communicate among each other, and PCs were beginning to do&#13;
&#13;
more of the word processing work.   They couldn't communicate&#13;
&#13;
with these systems, and communications or some form of&#13;
&#13;
networking was also becoming more and more important.&#13;
&#13;
     So, anyway, one of the first major pieces of work for&#13;
&#13;
this new department, under a new director who was recruited&#13;
&#13;
from the outside, by the name of Mel Ray from Duke, was to&#13;
&#13;
see if we couldn't establish some standards for the&#13;
&#13;
technology.   We started a somewhat major effort to evaluate&#13;
&#13;
varying technologies in the office technology arena to&#13;
&#13;
provide office technology capabilities built around some form&#13;
&#13;
of an intelligent programmable device, namely the PCs.     And&#13;
&#13;
the results of that work were to pick, and that work was&#13;
&#13;
done, we built a laboratory in N Building, within our office,&#13;
&#13;
to see if they would be worthwhile looking at and met the&#13;
                          ,_ -&#13;
Bank's needs, which had been defined pretty rigorously up&#13;
&#13;
front, and also testing them from an ergonomic viewpoint in&#13;
&#13;
terms of the quality of the display, the field, the keyboard,&#13;
&#13;
and so forth, having a hands-on test.   But, anyway, we built&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Rayfield, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
this laboratory and we began testing systems, and the result&#13;
&#13;
of a lot of work led to the adoption of some standards, first&#13;
&#13;
of all, that was the adoption for electronic mail, All-In-One&#13;
&#13;
as a standard.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Now we are talking about 198--&#13;
&#13;
A:       This was the '84 Decision, as it was called.                   It was to&#13;
&#13;
be made in '85 and then senior management was getting,&#13;
&#13;
perhaps daily, or weekly, or monthly input from everybody,&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
     we ought to do this,   11   11&#13;
                                      We ought to do that,    11&#13;
                                                                   and they&#13;
&#13;
finally said, "Look, let's not study this thing to death.&#13;
&#13;
Let's come up with a set of recommendations.                  11&#13;
                                                                   And we said,&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
     This is what we are going to do.          11&#13;
                                                     And that's what these&#13;
&#13;
decisions did.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Was this where the Medical Department was also involved&#13;
&#13;
in getting the workstations?&#13;
&#13;
A:       Not exactly.   The Medical&#13;
                               .... _ -&#13;
                                        Department was doing their own&#13;
&#13;
thing.      But about the same time.                This was really for Bank-&#13;
&#13;
wide use, unless there was some unique requirements that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank-wide requirements didn't really cover, which was the&#13;
&#13;
case with the Medical Department.                    In any case, we adopted&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
the IBM PC or its clones as the standard workstation, the&#13;
&#13;
Digital Equipment's All-In-One as the standard electronic&#13;
&#13;
mail system, MASS-11 as the word processing package, and we&#13;
&#13;
adopted a new networking capability, Banyon, as the standard&#13;
&#13;
networking capability for those folks who needed a network, a&#13;
&#13;
local area network.    I led that activity, and we had users&#13;
&#13;
involved, and we had staff involved, as well as consultants&#13;
&#13;
from outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Probably of all those decisions, certainly the MASS-11&#13;
&#13;
decision, got a lot of heat, certainly after it was&#13;
&#13;
announced, because the professionals in the Bank who were now&#13;
&#13;
really beginning to do word processing themselves on their&#13;
&#13;
own PCs, felt that MASS-11 was too geared to the secretary or&#13;
&#13;
the typing pool person who was really doing production word&#13;
&#13;
processing and not geared enough to the professional user.&#13;
&#13;
And, a lot of people   outsi4~~he   Bank were using Word&#13;
&#13;
Perfect.   So, the fact that we had adopted something&#13;
&#13;
different caused all sorts of compatibility problems.      That&#13;
&#13;
decision was an interesting one in that it generated an awful&#13;
&#13;
lot of heat.   It came down to a tie between MASS-11 and Word&#13;
                             I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
Perfect, and neither system met all the Bank requirements&#13;
&#13;
that had been identified by the Bank as requirements.         So&#13;
&#13;
both systems needed some modification, and the person in&#13;
&#13;
charge of the word processing selection and a small group,&#13;
&#13;
talked to each of the vendors about their willingness and the&#13;
&#13;
potential cost of modifying the package to meet the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
needs, which we didn't think were all that unique to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, that the general market would also want.      We also&#13;
&#13;
talked to them about the degree of support they would provide&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Well, Word Perfect was, as I recall, totally&#13;
&#13;
disinterested in committing to any modifications of their&#13;
&#13;
package to meet the Bank's needs, and also not thrilled with&#13;
&#13;
the idea of having to put some special support in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     On the other hand, MASS-11 committed to making all the&#13;
&#13;
changes within a year,   whi~~~they   did pretty much, as I&#13;
&#13;
recall, and also providing a person resident at no cost to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, which they also did.    So the decision was made in&#13;
&#13;
favor of MASS-11.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who was the person who conducted those discussions?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
A:      It was Greg Castano, who was leading that activity.   At&#13;
&#13;
that time, the Computer Priorities Committee had dissolved&#13;
&#13;
and had been replaced by something called the IMCC, the&#13;
&#13;
Information Management Coordinating Committee.      It was that&#13;
&#13;
committee to whom recommendations on all these things were&#13;
&#13;
made and who, after a lot of deliberations and useful&#13;
&#13;
comments, endorsed them and management accepted them.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It's interesting to note that even as we speak, three of&#13;
&#13;
those four decisions are the standard, it's only the MASS-11&#13;
&#13;
that has been subsequently modified.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah.   Actually, one of the amazing things is the All-&#13;
&#13;
In-One decision because, subsequent to that decision there&#13;
&#13;
were lots of requests from across the Bank from people who&#13;
&#13;
for one reason or another didn't like All-In-One, and so&#13;
&#13;
wanted to have some other mail system for their business&#13;
&#13;
unit.     The standards and the governance in place then really&#13;
                              ~-   -&#13;
argued against that, and so did the people like, Mel Ray,&#13;
&#13;
myself, George West, we were able to basically contain our&#13;
&#13;
mail system to one mail system, All-In-One, which makes us&#13;
&#13;
the envy of a lot of organizations outside the Bank today,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
who have four and five mail systems and are paying an&#13;
&#13;
incredible cost for the inability of one system to&#13;
&#13;
communicate with another or to interface.    So for all of its&#13;
&#13;
failings, and All-In-One has considerable, that decision has&#13;
&#13;
saved the Bank a lot of heartache and provided some important&#13;
&#13;
capabilities that we just otherwise wouldn't have for the&#13;
&#13;
purpose.&#13;
&#13;
     Today, that remains an important element 1n the&#13;
&#13;
enterprise network, and--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The IBM--&#13;
&#13;
A:   --the IBM PC remains the standard.     It's been augmented&#13;
&#13;
today by the Macintosh, and we are certainly more apt to use&#13;
&#13;
clones rather than the IBM product itself today, but&#13;
&#13;
fundamentally the technology is the same.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Just one more thing on office technology.    You were&#13;
&#13;
appointed in 1987 Chairman of the Bank-wide Steering&#13;
                            ~.   -&#13;
Committee composed of representatives from each complex to&#13;
&#13;
advise and oversee the computers for all projects.     Is there&#13;
&#13;
anything worth mentioning on that effort of yours?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think there were two things, then, the Computer-For-&#13;
&#13;
All project was fundamentally a way to get improved unit&#13;
&#13;
pricing for PCs for the Bank, and Harinder Kohli, who was&#13;
&#13;
then Department Director, rather, then Director of yet a new&#13;
&#13;
department called ITF, Information Technology Facility, was&#13;
&#13;
instrumental in getting us to look more at, at clones, at&#13;
&#13;
non-IBM products, which certainly began saving the Bank some&#13;
&#13;
money.&#13;
&#13;
     And then secondly, the demand from all the business&#13;
&#13;
units for personal computers began to grow enormously.     But,&#13;
&#13;
and up until that time business units had been buying&#13;
&#13;
computers on a one-on-one basis or three or four at a time,&#13;
&#13;
through individual submissions, as long as they were buying a&#13;
&#13;
standard product.   And we thought at that time that it made a&#13;
&#13;
great deal of sense to begin looking at combining our orders,&#13;
&#13;
and doing bulk orders, in order to get some improved pricing,&#13;
                           ~-   -&#13;
and some leverage with the vendor, so it was the idea first&#13;
&#13;
of pooling funds and then getting an improved price.&#13;
&#13;
     And in fact we did that, because we were paying then&#13;
&#13;
around $2,000 a PC, and we prepared a bid specification and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield 1 Page 36&#13;
&#13;
went out and got an extremely attractive price from some&#13;
&#13;
company called Omni something or other.   None of us had ever&#13;
&#13;
heard of this firm, but, their bid looked very attractive,&#13;
&#13;
and they were down around eleven hundred bucks for a machine,&#13;
&#13;
and their machine met all of our specifications, they&#13;
&#13;
delivered the machine and we liked what we saw.&#13;
&#13;
     And we then went to the next bidder after that, which&#13;
&#13;
was Zenith, a first-rate company, and we dealt with Zenith&#13;
&#13;
for three or four years after that.   And their price was only&#13;
&#13;
slightly higher.   But they'd already been selected by the&#13;
&#13;
Department of Defense and the U.S. Government to supply PCs&#13;
&#13;
to the Air Force and others, so they were geared up for what&#13;
&#13;
we wanted to do, and we began using Zenith.     We got good&#13;
&#13;
support from Zenith.&#13;
&#13;
     As that idea took hold of buying in bulk, P&amp;B created a&#13;
&#13;
role in the capital budget to permit these acquisitions.      So,&#13;
                           'Â·.   -&#13;
basically it was a cost saving move, and, it helped in&#13;
&#13;
getting workstations for people a lot faster.&#13;
&#13;
     I might add that the other decision that Harinder Kohli&#13;
&#13;
made which I think was very helpful, was the stimulation he&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Rayfield, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
provided for electronic mail.          Around 1987, there were only a&#13;
&#13;
few hundred users of electronic mail, All-In-One, in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     Harinderâ&#128;¢s notion was that we ought to provide mail&#13;
&#13;
capability to managers at no cost, and, because he, along&#13;
&#13;
with many of us, thought this was a very important and useful&#13;
&#13;
capability, which would eliminate phone tying to contact&#13;
&#13;
people who are in different time zones and let them reply at&#13;
&#13;
their convenience/ and you have a record of what was done,&#13;
&#13;
and all the good reasons for supporting electronic mail.          So&#13;
&#13;
we did that, and suddenly electronic mail grew exponentially&#13;
&#13;
and we could barely keep pace with the demand because as&#13;
&#13;
managers used it, they realized its value and wanted their&#13;
&#13;
staff on it, and then it was a charge-back service, and they&#13;
&#13;
were able to clearly see how the benefit outweighed the cost.&#13;
&#13;
And so that's what really started the pervasive use of&#13;
&#13;
electronic mail across the Bank.&#13;
                              ~-   -&#13;
Q:      And now it's virtually universal.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Absolutely.   So that was an important move.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      When you mentioned earlier the Information Resources&#13;
&#13;
Management concept, which I think is important in the history&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Rayfield, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
of this area of the Bank, could you go into a little more&#13;
&#13;
detail and describe your understanding of the Information&#13;
&#13;
Resources Management concept?           And could you give your&#13;
&#13;
assessment of the degree of the Bank 1 s success in&#13;
&#13;
implementing it?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Sure.   Let me actually go back a little before that, if&#13;
&#13;
I may, to 1978 or thereabouts, and paint the situation then&#13;
&#13;
and some things that led up to the adoption of the IRM&#13;
&#13;
concept.&#13;
&#13;
     By the late   1&#13;
                       70s, the use of computing, which is what it&#13;
&#13;
was then, had grown very rapidly, and the situation was still&#13;
&#13;
a central department dealing with the justification of&#13;
&#13;
budgets for everybody, trying to run a central computer to&#13;
&#13;
satisfy everybody, people becoming more computer-literate&#13;
&#13;
across the organization, seeing more and more potential&#13;
&#13;
applications for computing, and a backlog of application&#13;
                               ~.   -&#13;
development requirements which was something like five to ten&#13;
&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
     More and more of the staff resources that were provided&#13;
&#13;
for, under the two percent rule of McNamara of the budget&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
dedicated to maintaining systems, had already been devoted,&#13;
&#13;
so we had a dwindling supply of application developers and&#13;
&#13;
the situation was really unhappy for both the providers and&#13;
&#13;
the users of computing services.       It was not just a budget&#13;
&#13;
issue, there were personalities involved.       There were&#13;
&#13;
differences in expectations, and different views as to where&#13;
&#13;
the priorities ought to go.       And I might say at this time,&#13;
&#13;
still the Finance complex was getting the long share of&#13;
&#13;
resources, not that they shouldn 1 t, not that their needs were&#13;
&#13;
not important, but they were getting more of scarce&#13;
&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
      But there was also a growing recognition of the&#13;
&#13;
strategic value of technology, which was looked at as a&#13;
&#13;
backroom cost; a line item rather than a value-added package.&#13;
&#13;
But there was increasing recognition that, maybe this can&#13;
&#13;
                             - to capture it and deal with&#13;
really add value if we knew how&#13;
                              ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it.   There was also a growing awareness that the information&#13;
&#13;
was not as accessible or as timely or as reliable as the&#13;
&#13;
Bank 1 S information needed to be.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Rayfield, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
     So, the Computer Priorities Committee, and I believe it&#13;
&#13;
was Jim Kearns, who was the prime mover behind this,&#13;
&#13;
suggested to McNamara, who agreed, that we have a study done&#13;
&#13;
with the help of an outside consultant, to look at the future&#13;
&#13;
of computing at the Bank and where it's taking us and what we&#13;
&#13;
ought to do.&#13;
&#13;
     The study team was put together, and an outside&#13;
&#13;
consultant was hired, Bill Bindeman, a first-rate individual&#13;
&#13;
from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who later left them and became an&#13;
&#13;
official in the Canadian Government.       We hired this&#13;
&#13;
individual for his particular expertise, and he happened to&#13;
&#13;
come from Coopers &amp; Lybrand.        We put together a study team to&#13;
&#13;
work with him.   The members of the team were Richard Lynn&#13;
&#13;
from OPD, myself, and Tejinder Minhas, also from OPD.        We&#13;
&#13;
were to look at the situation, talk to other organizations&#13;
&#13;
about what they were doing in order to see what the Bank&#13;
                           ~-   -&#13;
should do, if there were any actions we should take to&#13;
&#13;
prepare us better for the future, or any corrective actions&#13;
&#13;
we should take for the present.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
     That study produced a number of recommendations, some of&#13;
&#13;
which are interesting, because one of them was that the&#13;
&#13;
staffs of OPD, Organization Planning Department, and the&#13;
&#13;
Computing Activities Department ought to be merged because&#13;
&#13;
they have similar skills and they are both involved in the&#13;
&#13;
management of change.   And it was here that we began to see&#13;
&#13;
computing and technology as an agent of change, and ITF and&#13;
&#13;
ORG, the successor to OPD, were merged.&#13;
&#13;
     Another recommendation, which is really the core of the&#13;
&#13;
Information Resource Management concept, had to be dealt with&#13;
&#13;
in a crisper manner than had been previously done; that the&#13;
&#13;
duplication of data had to be eliminated; there was a lot of&#13;
&#13;
waste in Operations and others because of untimely data or&#13;
&#13;
data that were defined differently; the fact that we used, at&#13;
&#13;
that time 14 different code sets for country names and lots&#13;
&#13;
of other things.&#13;
&#13;
     So we recommended that there be a Vice President for&#13;
&#13;
Information at the Bank, who could deal with what was&#13;
&#13;
becoming a highly politicized department of data and data&#13;
&#13;
base responsibility so he could deal with that, as well as&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 42&#13;
&#13;
provide leadership.   Also, he could help educate the other&#13;
&#13;
senior managers of the Bank who certainly couldn't be&#13;
&#13;
expected to grasp very much of the technology at that time,&#13;
&#13;
given where they were coming from, and begin to pull together&#13;
&#13;
the various functions in the Bank involved with the use and&#13;
&#13;
application of technology.       Failing the appointment of a Vice&#13;
&#13;
President, we then suggested that responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
information and technology be moved, or technology computing&#13;
&#13;
be moved from the office of the Vice President for&#13;
&#13;
Development Economics, who was still Hollis Chenery at that&#13;
&#13;
time, to the Administrative Department.       The Vice President&#13;
&#13;
there, or shortly after, became Martin Paijmans.&#13;
&#13;
     Another recommendation was that funding computing be put&#13;
&#13;
with the users, and we put services on some form of pay-back,&#13;
&#13;
an early euphemism for charge-back, but that we begin having&#13;
&#13;
users pay for their use of computing, or at least justify the&#13;
                             '   -&#13;
benefits and the cost.&#13;
&#13;
     Another recommendation, was that we invest more in the&#13;
&#13;
core work, the operational work, and we suggested that one of&#13;
&#13;
the ways to get that started was to do some piloting for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 43&#13;
&#13;
Operations by investing $600,000 in the coming fiscal year in&#13;
&#13;
applications really designed to help people in Operations.&#13;
&#13;
        Well, in any case, that report was finished, it was&#13;
&#13;
delivered to the Computer Priorities Committee, which was&#13;
&#13;
still in place then, endorsed by them, Jim Kearns sent it on&#13;
&#13;
to McNamara, who approved it.     He didn't buy off on the new&#13;
&#13;
Vice President for Information, but he did approve the&#13;
&#13;
recommendations and said, "Fine.     Put this function under the&#13;
&#13;
Administrative Vice President, and, we'll set up a pilot,"&#13;
&#13;
which he did fund at $600,000 the following year, to begin&#13;
&#13;
some work in Operations.     He also said at that time,   "You&#13;
&#13;
know, and if the computing funds are then limited, or overly&#13;
&#13;
restricted, anybody who wants to transfer some budget funds&#13;
&#13;
in any year to CAD, can do so, and then CAD can hire more&#13;
&#13;
people to do more work," and so forth.     In the following year&#13;
&#13;
we started the pilot work.     But that didn't progress very&#13;
&#13;
well.     The pilot work got off the track for a number of&#13;
&#13;
reasons.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Where was the pilot work being conducted?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 44&#13;
&#13;
A:   In Operations, by and large.   There were many ideas&#13;
&#13;
about what the pilot ought to do, and, the Operations people&#13;
&#13;
weren't really consulted, and I think that was not one of the&#13;
&#13;
better outcomes of the study.&#13;
&#13;
     Another outcome of the study was, we began to do some&#13;
&#13;
preliminary work on some charge-back arrangements.   And the&#13;
&#13;
first real incarnation of charge-back, or people paying and&#13;
&#13;
justifying for the service they received came about in 1980-&#13;
&#13;
81, with the Bank's acquisition of its first IBM mainframe.&#13;
&#13;
The situation at that time was that we were spending over a&#13;
&#13;
million and a half a year on buying outside services on IBM&#13;
&#13;
computers by service bureaus, and we thought we could save&#13;
&#13;
the Bank some money if we acquired our own machine and billed&#13;
&#13;
the users just like an outside service bureau.&#13;
&#13;
     We, the Computing Activities Department, working with&#13;
&#13;
some of the key IBM users, one of which was Jud Schilling,&#13;
                           ~-   -&#13;
put a proposal together which showed the Bank would save&#13;
&#13;
roughly half a million dollars a year on the purchase of a&#13;
&#13;
very small IBM system, an IBM 333 I think it was, and that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 45&#13;
&#13;
was bought off by PBD and McNamara, and so the first full&#13;
&#13;
charge-back machine was brought in.&#13;
&#13;
     It was a small IBM system.     Peter Shea, who was&#13;
&#13;
instrumental in doing a lot of the analytical work, was in&#13;
&#13;
charge of it.   We had the first user advisory group with real&#13;
&#13;
teeth, chaired by Jud Schilling, and that was really the&#13;
&#13;
birth of the IBM facility center.&#13;
&#13;
     The important part was that it was the first venture&#13;
&#13;
into full charge-back; all costs being recovered from the&#13;
&#13;
users, the users doing demand projections, saying what they&#13;
&#13;
were willing to pay, determining the levels of service, and&#13;
&#13;
the department acting as a service provider, geared up to&#13;
&#13;
meet their service requirements.&#13;
&#13;
     The reason that was important is because that played an&#13;
&#13;
important role in the adoption of the IRM concept.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, what is, as you see it, Information Resources&#13;
                           '   -&#13;
Management?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It is the focusing on information as a resource, and,&#13;
&#13;
putting the users of the information, fundamentally in charge&#13;
&#13;
of what information they will get, how it will be delivered,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Rayfield, Page 46&#13;
&#13;
the timeliness, definition, and the building of technology&#13;
&#13;
that supports the processing, delivery, storage, presentation&#13;
&#13;
of that information around these needs, so that it is the&#13;
&#13;
technology, the information, that is, the dog wagging the&#13;
&#13;
technology tail instead of the flip, which had been the case&#13;
&#13;
until then.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But also, you are putting the consumer in charge, by&#13;
&#13;
virtue of the fact that he is charged for this, and allocates&#13;
&#13;
his resources appropriately.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Absolutely, and decides how his resources -- for&#13;
&#13;
information management, which can include the technology&#13;
&#13;
are going to be spent, or not spent at all.   He might decide&#13;
&#13;
that he would much prefer to have a consultant do some&#13;
&#13;
analytical work than invest in a data base, which is fair&#13;
&#13;
enough; or that the service that he or she, the consumer, or&#13;
&#13;
the client, is going to use, .should be from Planning Research&#13;
                           ~-   -&#13;
Corporation, an external vendor, rather than from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So that was the whole notion, that the consumer, client,&#13;
&#13;
subject to some institutional guidelines, policies,&#13;
&#13;
procedures, would be the determining factor of how technology&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 47&#13;
&#13;
was going to be used to meet their business needs, and how&#13;
&#13;
much they were willing to spend in the application of&#13;
&#13;
technology.   And the Information Resource Management concept&#13;
&#13;
also, at least in our context, and to me, meant the&#13;
&#13;
integration of technologies, not the artificial separations.&#13;
&#13;
     So in 1981-82 we did a study and looked at the&#13;
&#13;
organizational ramifications, based on lessons of the past,&#13;
&#13;
and coinciding with the fact that the Director of CAD, Merv&#13;
&#13;
Muller, was now moving on to other things in the Bank, so,&#13;
&#13;
this was a timely point to look at alternatives.       We also&#13;
&#13;
very much wanted to get the users much more active in the&#13;
&#13;
management of technology and information.       So the Information&#13;
&#13;
Management Resource concept was adopted in 1982.       Martin&#13;
&#13;
Paijmans remained the Vice President in charge, and the&#13;
&#13;
department, IRMD, Information Resource Management Department&#13;
&#13;
was formed.   It had the old Computing Activities Department&#13;
                             '   -&#13;
responsibilities, plus responsibility for office automation,&#13;
&#13;
or office technology as it was called, and some forms of&#13;
&#13;
electronic communications.       A client-user advisory group was&#13;
&#13;
set up, the IMCC, and we decided to adopt on a much broader&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 48&#13;
&#13;
scale the charge-back, which had proven to be effective in&#13;
&#13;
the case of the IBM/ so that not only were users accountable&#13;
&#13;
for identifying benefits and so forth, but would also see&#13;
&#13;
real bills.    As soon as charge-back was instituted 1 the users&#13;
&#13;
began, instead of moving money out of computing, moving more&#13;
&#13;
of their other discretionary money in, and demand for&#13;
&#13;
computing exploded and the capacity of a lot of machines had&#13;
&#13;
to be increased almost immediately.&#13;
&#13;
     The users were making that call, so there was a dramatic&#13;
&#13;
difference there.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How would you give your assessment in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
degree of the Bankâ&#128;¢s success in implementing the IRM concept?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well,    I think, it was a mixed bag.   I think the charge-&#13;
&#13;
back idea turned out to be very successful, at least when it&#13;
&#13;
came to hardware-based and technology-based services.      But it&#13;
&#13;
was an abysmal failure when it came to people-based services,&#13;
                             '   -&#13;
the system development side, for a variety of reasons, in&#13;
&#13;
part the management of that activity, and the Bankâ&#128;¢s cost&#13;
&#13;
structure for people.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 49&#13;
&#13;
     On the hardware side we were able to negotiate some very&#13;
&#13;
attractive deals on the purchase-lease of hardware and&#13;
&#13;
support from vendors and so forth, much better than the&#13;
&#13;
industry at large.   On the people side we were using,&#13;
&#13;
compared to the outside market, some fairly expensive folks.&#13;
&#13;
So that's one of the reasons that the selling of systems&#13;
&#13;
development services did not pan out.&#13;
&#13;
     The notion that information was a vital resource that&#13;
&#13;
needed to be managed and shared across the organization, I&#13;
&#13;
think people accepted intellectually but never emotionally,&#13;
&#13;
so that the problems of information were really not, to a&#13;
&#13;
large degree, tackled or solved by the adoption of the IRM&#13;
&#13;
concept, and they remain today.&#13;
&#13;
     I think a lot of Bank managers were unprepared because&#13;
&#13;
of their training and experience, to accept this&#13;
&#13;
responsibility.   In retrospect, we did not do a good job in&#13;
                           'Â·   -&#13;
explaining to a department director or a division chief what&#13;
&#13;
it meant for him or her now to be responsible for information&#13;
&#13;
resources, so in that sense it didn't work out well.     The&#13;
&#13;
trade off; the bringing of office automation, the technology&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page SO&#13;
&#13;
was an important step, so that part worked well.       And&#13;
&#13;
certainly the first moves to begin bringing communications in&#13;
&#13;
helped.   So it was a mixed bag.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Along   w~th   the introduction of office technology came a&#13;
&#13;
revolution in work processes in the Bank.      What&#13;
&#13;
considerations went into the planning of this revolution?&#13;
&#13;
And also, what were the human factors involved in the&#13;
&#13;
introduction of office technology, which is to say the&#13;
&#13;
ability and willingness of the clients to use the new office&#13;
&#13;
technology to maximum effort for both the support staff and&#13;
&#13;
higher level staff?     And with the benefit of hindsight, what&#13;
&#13;
expectations have been fulfilled, which have not, and were&#13;
&#13;
there any surprises?      That covers a wide area, but I think an&#13;
&#13;
interesting one.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yeah.    When we say what considerations went into&#13;
&#13;
planning this revolution in our work processes in the Bank,&#13;
                              '~   -&#13;
or really in the office, I think that may give a lot more&#13;
&#13;
credit than is deserved to somebody.      It's certainly, the&#13;
&#13;
Central Department, whether it was R&amp;D or ITF.        And, there&#13;
&#13;
were very few people then in the Bank who understood what&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 51&#13;
&#13;
might happen as technology was introduced.     Who would have&#13;
&#13;
forecast that higher-level staff would be doing their own&#13;
&#13;
document creation?     That would have been at the time so&#13;
&#13;
foreign to the way in which the Bank and that process worked.&#13;
&#13;
But I think what happened was, which is so often perhaps the&#13;
&#13;
case with technology, that it's there and you learn new ways&#13;
&#13;
to work building on this tool, so that the tool itself is an&#13;
&#13;
enabler for process change.&#13;
&#13;
        Who would have expected the proliferation of&#13;
&#13;
spreadsheets, and even simulation models on PCs?       Or the&#13;
&#13;
collaborative process in doing documents using networking and&#13;
&#13;
word processing?     Or, and I guess the bottom line is&#13;
&#13;
electronic mail.&#13;
&#13;
        We really looked at electronic mail as an informal way&#13;
&#13;
for staff member A to communicate with staff member B in a&#13;
&#13;
very strict person-to-person-messaging approach, but now it's&#13;
                             'Â·   -&#13;
used.     You send mail to application programs that are&#13;
&#13;
running, so it's a person to an application, or in some cases&#13;
&#13;
it's an application back to people.     When this technology was&#13;
&#13;
introduced none of us really envisioned that or had any clear&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 52&#13;
&#13;
idea of what the processes would be.       And certainly the use&#13;
&#13;
of mail today in the Bank is a far cry from what we thought&#13;
&#13;
it might be when we started introducing it.&#13;
&#13;
     I don't think that the experience of the Bank is much&#13;
&#13;
different than outside organizations in this context, and I&#13;
&#13;
suspect that this is the nature of technology.      Groupware,&#13;
&#13;
group conferencing, groupware that's now one of the more&#13;
&#13;
recent developments in technology, you can't anticipate how a&#13;
&#13;
group will work together until you actually get in and start&#13;
&#13;
using this, and you find a whole different way in which work&#13;
&#13;
groups work together and get ideas out, and the acceptance of&#13;
&#13;
technology, which is I guess what you mean by the ability and&#13;
&#13;
willingness of clients.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.   Well, there are two different aspects.      The&#13;
&#13;
absorptive, the simple absorptive capacity on the one hand,&#13;
&#13;
and secondly there are    jus~ ~hose   old retrograde souls who&#13;
&#13;
just don't want--&#13;
&#13;
A:   They don't want to use it, or who don't want to have to&#13;
&#13;
learn how to do a new thing, or find it uncomfortable.          But,&#13;
&#13;
I don't know, this is often described as a bell-shaped curve&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 53&#13;
&#13;
with at one end of the bell the folks who are the&#13;
&#13;
technological leaders, who are out in front of everybody&#13;
&#13;
trying everything new; on the other hand, the other extreme,&#13;
&#13;
the folks who won't do anything new.   By and large, the Bank&#13;
&#13;
is probably skewed towards trying technology and being more&#13;
&#13;
comfortable with its use, and--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And more innovative in its applications.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly more innovative in its applications.   The Bank&#13;
&#13;
also, when we picked the standards, and then more recently,&#13;
&#13;
has been very active, not only in what the technology does&#13;
&#13;
but in the ergonomics also.   So people like Rick Barry have&#13;
&#13;
been very active in finding and looking at monitors, at&#13;
&#13;
questions of electromagnetic radiation in terms of glare, 1n&#13;
&#13;
terms of crispness, keyboards, furniture to prevent carpal&#13;
&#13;
tunnel syndrome, aspects such as making it physically&#13;
&#13;
comfortable to use, as well as intellectually.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, we've learned a great deal about the design of&#13;
&#13;
interfaces and softwares so that the systems are more than&#13;
&#13;
user-friendly, they are intuitive.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Rayfield, Page 54&#13;
&#13;
     On terms of what expectations have been fulfilled and&#13;
&#13;
whether there were surprises or not, I think the big surprise&#13;
&#13;
is one we talked about earlier, which was the way in which we&#13;
&#13;
are using electronic mail today versus the way we thought it&#13;
&#13;
might be used.   One of the missed expectations I think is&#13;
&#13;
still our understanding across the Bank of the importance of&#13;
&#13;
information and our ability to really do something about this&#13;
&#13;
issue, because, even though we've had progress, we still have&#13;
&#13;
lots of people who can't find out what information is&#13;
&#13;
available, lots of duplicated information, or people going&#13;
&#13;
out and reinventing information because they don't know it's&#13;
&#13;
there or can't get to it, and it's information in paper form&#13;
&#13;
as well as electronically stored information.&#13;
&#13;
     One of the disappointments here I think is the fact that&#13;
&#13;
some people within the Bank continue to be rooted in their&#13;
&#13;
own world, and there is some hesitancy in sharing information&#13;
                           ~.   -&#13;
and making it available.   And that's not helpful.   It's the&#13;
&#13;
institution's resource, and probably next to the people, the&#13;
&#13;
most vital resource of the institution.   It's what makes the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 55&#13;
&#13;
Bank really have value in terms of its experience and so&#13;
&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   With regard to the electronic mail, I want to make sure&#13;
&#13;
I have this clearly.   From what you've said, it seems your&#13;
&#13;
initial expectations were people, that people would just&#13;
&#13;
write brief messages to each other, whereas in fact whatâ&#128;¢s&#13;
&#13;
happened is people write sometimes page after page almost on&#13;
&#13;
electronic mail.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, no.   It's that the mail system became a de facto&#13;
&#13;
network on that, so it became a mechanism for delivering&#13;
&#13;
information, for doing searches of information, for ordering&#13;
&#13;
supplies, it became a transaction processing system, and, as&#13;
&#13;
I said, a lot of people look at it as a network, which in&#13;
&#13;
fact it is, which is connected to networks outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   From your point of view, what measurable benefits would&#13;
&#13;
you say have been   realizedf~om   the widespread introduction&#13;
&#13;
of office technology in the Bank?     For instance,   I   know there&#13;
&#13;
have been studies done which effectively say that, for all&#13;
&#13;
the introduction of technology, not just in the Bank but&#13;
&#13;
outside too, for all this investment in techno.logy, there&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Rayfield, Page 56&#13;
&#13;
seems to be few if any productivity gains.      What perspective&#13;
&#13;
do you offer on that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Perhaps not a great deal of perspective.       It 1 s&#13;
&#13;
interesting that when you talk to people, like Eddie Segura,&#13;
&#13;
in LAC, you hear of experiences where technology has enabled&#13;
&#13;
them either to dramatically cut the time involved in doing&#13;
&#13;
something or it has enabled them to do something that without&#13;
&#13;
technology they just simply couldn 1 t do.    Yet when you see&#13;
&#13;
these studies, more often than not the conclusion is that&#13;
&#13;
there are no productivity gains, and it seems to me that&#13;
&#13;
these two messages are totally inconsistent.      It may be that&#13;
&#13;
we don 1 t know how to measure the productivity--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It 1 s kind of gratuitous, isn 1 t it?&#13;
&#13;
A:   --of what the Bank does.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Certainly, I hate to harp on the electronic mail thing,&#13;
&#13;
but certainly when.you talk to Russell Cheetham, who when he&#13;
                             ~-   -&#13;
was Director and had Indonesia, he and the Indonesian&#13;
&#13;
Government were on the mail system and, he would say how he&#13;
&#13;
could sit in his office and look at some data and be assured&#13;
&#13;
that the official in the Indonesian Government was looking at&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 57&#13;
&#13;
the very same data, that's got to be effective, and that's&#13;
&#13;
got to be helpful.&#13;
&#13;
     So I believe that the technology certainly has&#13;
&#13;
contributed.   I also believe that perhaps we can't always&#13;
&#13;
measure, even though mail is an excellent example of one&#13;
&#13;
area, but clearly not the only area.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In April 1992 you were appointed head of the newly-&#13;
&#13;
established Information Utility, and so there was a great&#13;
&#13;
deal of more paper-based information in terms of the Regional&#13;
&#13;
Information Centers and the Archives.     So this question is a&#13;
&#13;
hybrid of these two roles that are merged in one, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
your span of control at that time.     With the introduction of&#13;
&#13;
personal computers in the Bank and the creation of&#13;
&#13;
development of data bases and networks, what role do you see,&#13;
&#13;
given this perspective that you were able to have, what roles&#13;
&#13;
do you see for information intermediaries such as the&#13;
                           ~-   -&#13;
Regional Information Services Center, or the Archives,&#13;
&#13;
especially given the likely evolution of technology as you&#13;
&#13;
see it?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Rayfield, Page 58&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I believe that the whole reason in the Bank for&#13;
&#13;
having technology, putting aside some transactions systems&#13;
&#13;
and some other systems in Finance, is really to make&#13;
&#13;
information readily available to the staff as well as outside&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and ensure that people have whatever information&#13;
&#13;
they need to do their jobs.       The Bank has, first of all, an&#13;
&#13;
incredible wealth of information, but it's also incredible&#13;
&#13;
that most people in the Bank don't know what the Bank has or&#13;
&#13;
how to get to it, and I think that's where technology can&#13;
&#13;
help.     In the short term at least, this notion of information&#13;
&#13;
intermediaries is going to be vital to bridge the tremendous&#13;
&#13;
value that's in the Bank's information storers and, the&#13;
&#13;
people who need access could use this information.&#13;
&#13;
        It's much more cost-effective, at least in the short&#13;
&#13;
term, to have people who are experts in information searching&#13;
&#13;
and retrieval, help the professionals in Operations access&#13;
                             '~   -&#13;
this information and get it to them in a timely manner, than&#13;
&#13;
trying to turn all the economists and engineers into&#13;
&#13;
information specialists.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Rayfield, Page 59&#13;
&#13;
        So I think there is a big role.   But that 1 s really just&#13;
&#13;
a personal view.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Finally, you 1 ve had a long and distinguished career 1n&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and in the course of that career you 1 ve had the&#13;
&#13;
opportunity to work with many different staff.        Could you&#13;
&#13;
name a few who particularly stand out in your mind, and what&#13;
&#13;
were their contributions that you believe were most important&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank's work?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I think I've named a few already.    Merv Muller,&#13;
&#13;
who was the first Director Â·of Computing Activities, who&#13;
&#13;
brought, first of all, the discipline and a highly&#13;
&#13;
professional approach to the early work of computing in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     There is Harinder Kohli, who as Director of ITF, I&#13;
&#13;
think was instrumental in a number of initiatives that&#13;
&#13;
established where we are today.      Mel Ray, who was Director of&#13;
&#13;
the Information Resource Management Department from '82 to&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    86, really was instrumental in getting the notion of IRM&#13;
&#13;
started, led the development of a first strategic view of&#13;
&#13;
information, which was important, and got the governance for&#13;
&#13;
information resou~ces and the standards idea rolling.        There&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Rayfield, Page 60&#13;
&#13;
was Hywel Davies, who I think brought networking to the point&#13;
&#13;
where it is today, where it's now accepted as an important&#13;
&#13;
piece of Bank infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
     I think Richard Lynn and his contribution of the Future&#13;
&#13;
of Computing study, his understanding of technology, and now&#13;
&#13;
in his role in the budgeting function, has made an important&#13;
&#13;
contribution.&#13;
&#13;
     People in the Priorities Committee, Jim Kearns for&#13;
&#13;
certain.   We canâ&#128;¢t really forget the people who made it&#13;
&#13;
really happen for clients, which are all those who worked&#13;
&#13;
early on in CAD, then in varying department, whether they&#13;
&#13;
were computer operators or system developers or managers,&#13;
&#13;
really did an incredible job, and there are, interestingly&#13;
&#13;
enough, applications running today that were developed 15&#13;
&#13;
years ago in various places, by people like Hans Schneider in&#13;
&#13;
Finance.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, Wayne, this has been a very interesting and&#13;
&#13;
productive interview.   Thank you very much.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Wayne Rayfield held on November 21, 1994
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In November 1994, Wayne Rayfield was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Charles Ziegler, and David Milobsky.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1971 to 1995, Mr.
            Rayfield worked in the following areas: as deputy director
            of the computing activities department (1971-1982) and of
            the computing task force for the office of the vice
            president, administration, organization, and personnel
            management (1979-1980); as assistant director for the
            information resource management department (1982-1986) and
            for the technology service and maintenance in the
            information, technology and facilities department
            (1986-1987); and as head of the computing technology center
            in the information technology and facilities department
            (1987-1992), of information utility (1992-1994), and of the
            organization and business practices department for the
            office of the director (1994). His transcript concerns the
            evolution of information technology at the World Bank since
            president Robert McNamara felt that computing was not
            getting enough attention.
