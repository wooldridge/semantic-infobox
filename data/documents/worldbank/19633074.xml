Recipient's capacity to respond promptly and efficiently to an Eligible Crisis or Emergency.&#13;

1.      The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such a financing, and of&#13;
&#13;
the purpose to which the proceeds of the financing are to be applied.&#13;

2. The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of such&#13;
&#13;
financing are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
&#13;
Republic of Madagascar and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of&#13;
&#13;
Madagascar.&#13;
