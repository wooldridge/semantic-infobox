Lessons from small municipalities in Ecuador&#13;
&#13;
Delegating water and sanitation&#13;
services to autonomous operators&#13;
&#13;
This field note documents the experience of the Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Program (PRAGUAS), executed in Ecuador and financed by the World Bank. Under the PRAGUAS&#13;
program, the national government offers municipalities technical assistance and financial incentives to&#13;
delegate the provision of water (and sanitation) services to autonomous (public or private) operators.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 PRAGUAS represents an effort to modernize public water and sanitation&#13;
 services with the active participation of communities, municipalities, NGOs&#13;
 and the local private sector.&#13;

            Lessons from small municipalities in
            Ecuador: delegating water and sanitation services to
            autonomous operators
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note documents the experience
            of the Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation
            Program (PRAGUAS), executed in Ecuador and financed by the
            World Bank. Under the PRAGUAS program, the national
            government offers municipalities technical assistance and
            financial incentives to delegate the provision of water (and
            sanitation) services to autonomous (public or private) operators.
