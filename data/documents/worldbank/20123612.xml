&#13;
This paper examines Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural minimum living standard guarantee (dibao) program, one of&#13;
the largest targeted transfer schemes in the world. Using household survey data matched with&#13;
published administrative data, we provide background on the patterns of inequality and&#13;
poverty in rural China, describe the dibao program, estimate the programâ&#128;&#153;s impact on poverty,&#13;
and carry out targeting analysis. We find that the program provides sufficient income to poor&#13;
beneficiaries but does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty, in part because the&#13;
number of beneficiaries is small relative to the number of poor. Conventional targeting analysis&#13;
reveals rather large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting errors; propensity score targeting&#13;
analysis yields smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of possible reforms to the&#13;
dibao program indicate that expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty reduction&#13;
than increasing transfer amounts. In addition, replacing locally diverse dibao lines with a&#13;
nationally uniform dibao threshold could in theory reduce poverty. The potential gains in&#13;
poverty reduction, however, depend on the effectiveness of targeting.&#13;

&amp;#12;  I.   Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s economic reforms have brought substantial growth in rural incomes, but have been&#13;
accompanied by a substantial weakening of public goods provision and the social safety net in&#13;
rural areas. Since the late 1990s Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s central government has pursued a multi-pronged&#13;
effort to rebuild rural social programs.    Relevant measures have included the new rural&#13;
cooperative medical system, the expansion of universal, free nine-year education in rural areas,&#13;
and the minimum living standard guarantee or dibao program (Lin and Wong 2012, World Bank&#13;
2009). The last of theseâ&#128;&#148;the rural dibao programâ&#128;&#148;is the focus of this study.&#13;
       The stated aim of the rural dibao program is to provide income transfers to households&#13;
with income per capita below an income threshold. The transfers are intended to bring the&#13;
recipientsâ&#128;&#153; incomes up to the threshold. The threshold and transfer amounts are determined&#13;
locally in light of local conditions. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s adoption of this approach to poverty&#13;
alleviation was motivated by the changing structure of poverty in rural China. During the 1980s&#13;
and 1990s the overall incidence of poverty in rural China declined substantially, poverty&#13;
became more dispersed geographically, and transitory poverty emerged as an important issue&#13;
(World Bank 2009, World Bank Social Protection Group 2010). In contrast to Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s earlier&#13;
â&#128;&#156;poor areaâ&#128;&#157; poverty alleviation programs, which targeted localities and communities, the dibao&#13;
program targets households and individuals wherever they reside and provides transfers based&#13;
on income shortfalls. Thus, it is well suited to the new environment.&#13;
       Experiments with dibao programs began in the 1990s, and Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program&#13;
was adopted nationwide in 2007. By 2010 its coverage exceeded 50 million people, making it&#13;
one of the largest social relief programs in the world.        Program expenditures are also&#13;
substantial, in 2011 equivalent to 0.14% of GDP and 0.6% of total government expenditures.&#13;
Despite its size, little is known about the programâ&#128;&#153;s performance.        Several reports have&#13;
provided insightful descriptive analyses and preliminary evaluations of the programâ&#128;&#153;s successes&#13;
and challenges (World Bank Social Protection Group 2010, World Bank 2011; Luo and Sicular&#13;
2013). To our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of the rural dibao programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;benefit incidence and impact on poverty reduction since 2007, when the program was rolled&#13;
out nationwide.&#13;
         The literature on poverty program evaluation in developing countries is extensive, as is&#13;
the debate regarding appropriate methodologies (see, for example, Deaton 2010 and Ravallion&#13;
2008).    A central focus of this literature is how to address empirical issues that arise due to&#13;
selection bias and due to the behavioral responses of program participants. These concerns are&#13;
relevant to Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s dibao program, but are not the focus of this paper. In view of the lack of&#13;
basic information about Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program, our goal is description and basic analyses&#13;
using well-known empirical methods that can inform policy. Our work follows in the footsteps&#13;
of recent analyses of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s urban dibao program (Chen, Ravallion and Wang 2006; Gao,&#13;
Garfinkel and Zhai 2009; Wang 2007; Ravallion 2008), with some differences in approach&#13;
reflecting differences between the urban and rural programs as well as data availability.&#13;
         Our analysis makes use of household-level data from the China Household Income&#13;
Project (CHIP) surveys, matched with administrative data on the dibao program from the&#13;
Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA), for the years 2007-2009. Our central finding is that in practice&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program provides substantial income benefits to program beneficiaries,&#13;
bringing many low-income beneficiaries above the dibao income thresholds and also out of&#13;
poverty. Nevertheless, due to limited coverage relative to the large total number of rural poor&#13;
in China, as well as high exclusion and inclusion errors, its effect on poverty reduction has been&#13;
small. The overall impact of the rural dibao program is thus less than expected given the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s design and scale.       Our findings suggest that although the dibao benefits are&#13;
adequate, improvements are needed in coverage and targeting.&#13;
         These conclusions emerge both from a conventional targeting analysis using household&#13;
incomes as the evaluation criterion and from an alternative, propensity score approach. In&#13;
settings such as rural China where measurement of household income is difficult,&#13;
administrators of conditional transfer programs often rely on observable correlates of income&#13;
to determine eligibility. Even in Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s urban areas, where income is more likely to be in the&#13;
form of salaries and wages and so easier to observe, measurement errors can arise (Chen,&#13;
Ravallion and Wang 2006). In their evaluation of the urban dibao program, Chen, Ravallion and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;Wang (2006) suggest use of a propensity score approach that evaluates the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance based on the sorts of income proxies that are likely used by local officials carrying&#13;
out the program. We adopt this approach to analyze Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program. Although the&#13;
propensity score analysis reduces the magnitude of exclusion and inclusion errors, the targeting&#13;
errors remain large.&#13;
       Our findings raise questions about whether changes in the rural dibao program might&#13;
increase its impact on poverty reduction. The government has, in fact, further expanded the&#13;
dibao program since 2009. We therefore carry out simulations that explore the impact of&#13;
increasing the dibao budget from its observed level in the 2009 CHIP data by (a) expanding the&#13;
number of beneficiaries without changing the transfer amounts, and (b) doubling the transfer&#13;
amounts without increasing the number of beneficiaries. These simulations assume that, aside&#13;
from changes in the transfer amounts and number of beneficiaries, other aspects of the&#13;
program are unchanged. The results indicate that expanding coverage has the potential to&#13;
yield greater reductions in poverty than increasing transfer amounts.&#13;
       In actual practice, the dibao thresholds and transfer amounts are set locally at the&#13;
county level and are correlated with local fiscal capacity. Consequently, poor counties tend to&#13;
have lower dibao thresholds and transfers than do rich counties, with implications for targeting&#13;
and the poverty impact of the program. We construct several simulations to investigate the&#13;
impact of adopting a uniform nationwide dibao threshold combined and a uniform nationwide&#13;
transfer amount. The results of these simulations indicate that adopting uniform transfer&#13;
amounts in the context of the existing system would likely have little poverty impact. A&#13;
uniform transfer would be beneficial only if inclusionary targeting error is reduced. Shifting to a&#13;
nationally uniform eligibility threshold has the potential to substantially reduce poverty, but&#13;
again depending on targeting performance.&#13;
       We begin in the next section with an overview of the rural dibao program and discussion&#13;
of some relevant literature. Section III describes the data. Section IV provides background on&#13;
overall trends in rural inequality and poverty in China. Section V describes patterns of dibao&#13;
participation, thresholds, and transfers in the data.      Section VI examines whether dibao&#13;
transfers bring recipient households above the dibao thresholds and out of poverty. Section VII&#13;

&#13;
 II.    Background on Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program is modeled after the urban dibao program, which began i n the&#13;
early 1990s on an experimental basis in some cities. In 1999 the State Council implemented the&#13;
urban dibao program in all cities nationwide. Participation in recent years has stabilized at&#13;
about 22 to 23 million urban individuals (Chen, Ravallion and Wang 2006, Oâ&#128;&#153;Keefe 2004,&#13;
Ministry of Civil Affairs 2011).&#13;
        Experiments with rural dibao began in the 1990s, mainly in more developed areas. By&#13;
the early 2000s rural dibao programs were fairly widespread, but they relied on local funding&#13;
and, due to differences in local fiscal capacity, varied across counties in terms of the level of&#13;
support and criteria for eligibility. In 2004 the central government called for the rural dibao&#13;
program to expand and began to provide funding for the program in poor areas; by the end of&#13;
2006 roughly 80 percent of the provinces and counties in China had adopted some form of rural&#13;
dibao program (Ministry of Civil Affairs 2007, World Bank Social Protection Group 2010, Xu and&#13;
Zhang 2010).&#13;
        In early 2007 the central government announced that the rural dibao program was to be&#13;
implemented nationwide in all counties and with central subsidies (Xinhua 2007a, 2007b; World&#13;
Bank Social Protection Group 2010; Xu and Zhang 2010).            Under this new initiative, the&#13;
program would become more standardized and would absorb or complement several pre-&#13;
existing programs that had provided subsidies for poor households such as the five-guarantee&#13;
(wubao) program and the subsidy program for destitute households ( tekun jiuzhu). Although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 7&#13;
&amp;#12;central funding of the program increased, the minimum income thresholds and subsidy&#13;
amounts continued to be set locally at the county level in light of local fiscal capacity.&#13;
   Official statistics indicate that the rural dibao program grew quickly after 2006 (Table 1). In&#13;
2007, the first year of nationwide implementation, the rural dibao program provided transfers&#13;
to 35.7 million rural individuals (4.9% of the rural population) and accounted for three-quarters&#13;
of the rural recipients of social relief, followed in a far second place by the five-guarantee&#13;
program, which covered 5 million recipients (Department of Social, Science and Technology&#13;
Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics 2008, p. 330; National Bureau of Statistics 2009,&#13;
pp. 89, 939). By 2010-11 program participation had leveled off at about 53 million individuals,&#13;
equivalent to 8% of the rural population. This is more than double the size of the urban dibao&#13;
program (23 million), and it far outnumbers the sum total of participants in all other rural&#13;
poverty relief programs (17.9 million in 2010; does not include disaster relief) (Ministry of Civil&#13;
Affairs 2011; National Bureau of Statistics 2011).&#13;
       Spending on the program has grown apace (Table 1). According to official statistics, in&#13;
2007 total spending on the rural dibao program was 23 billion yuan, with an average transfer&#13;
amount of 1,210 yuan per recipient per year. In 2011 total spending on the rural dibao&#13;
program was 67 billion yuan or, on average, 1,258 yuan per recipient per year, an amount&#13;
equivalent to more than half of the official poverty line in that year (2,300 yuan).&#13;
       In view of the diversity of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural economy and the difficulty of measuring income&#13;
for rural households, it is not surprising that the programâ&#128;&#153;s implementatio n has varied among&#13;
localities and evolved over time. Local variation and flexibility was explicitly built into the&#13;
central dibao policy regulations (Poverty Alleviation Office of the State Council 2010). Reports&#13;
based on fieldwork provide insights into how the program has worked on the ground.&#13;
       According to reports based on fieldwork from the World Bank (World Bank Social&#13;
Protection Group 2010, World Bank 2011), variation exists in the extent to which applications&#13;
are open versus by invitation of local officials. In practice village leaders often identify potential&#13;
beneficiaries and invite them to apply. Village committees, which include village leaders and&#13;
other community members, play a central role in identifying and screening potential&#13;
beneficiaries.   Members of village committees live in close proximity to and have local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    8&#13;
&amp;#12;knowledge of potential beneficiary households. Applications or nominations for dibao benefits&#13;
are submitted to the township government and forwarded to the county Department of Civil&#13;
Affairs. Decisions are made by township and county officials, who review the documentary&#13;
evidence submitted by households and villages, and who sometimes visit the households to&#13;
check on, or to collect additional, information. The names of applicants are, in principle, made&#13;
public in the villages and are subject to community review and feedback.&#13;
       National policy permits, and local officials in practice make use of, a range of&#13;
information to evaluate eligibility. This might include information about household income,&#13;
assets, and housing conditions, as well as the presence of household members who are able or&#13;
unable to work, or of illness or disability (Poverty Alleviation Office of the State Council 2010;&#13;
World Bank Social Protection Group 2010; World Bank 2011).&#13;
       In principle the dibao program tops up the income of recipients to the level of the local&#13;
dibao threshold. The amount of the dibao benefit, then, should depend on the level of the&#13;
dibao threshold and the level of a householdâ&#128;&#153;s per capita income. As will be discussed in more&#13;
detail later, dibao thresholds vary substantially among provinces and counties. Practices&#13;
regarding how to determine the amount of the benefit also vary. In some areas local officials&#13;
estimate the gap between the householdâ&#128;&#153;s income and the local dibao threshold and decide on&#13;
the benefit accordingly. Due to difficulties accurately measuring income, most localities use&#13;
other approaches. The 2007 national policy allowed local officials to classify households in tiers&#13;
according to their apparent level of poverty and to set fixed benefit amounts associated with&#13;
each tier. This tier-classification approach appears to have been widely used (World Bank&#13;
Social Protection Group 2010).&#13;
       Several reports have noted that although the flexible design of the dibao&#13;
implementation policy has advantages, it gives officials at the county, township and village&#13;
levels considerable discretionary power. The program does not appear to have well-functioning&#13;
checks and balances, in part because of limited resources at the local level for administration of&#13;
the program. These characteristics of the program create the potential for irregularities (World&#13;
Bank 2011). In the Chinese-language media reports of dibao irregularities are numerous, so&#13;
much so that they have been classified into standard categories: giving dibao on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;connections or personal relationships (guanxi bao, renqing bao), cheating (pian bao), and&#13;
mistakes (cuo bao). An internet search using Baidu yielded many reports of irregularities in&#13;
multiple localities, including a widely discussed case of dibao corruption in Fang County, Hubei,&#13;
as well as cases in Shaanxi, Shandong and Guangxi.&#13;
       Problems with the dibao program are of concern to Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s central leadership and policy&#13;
circles. In 2012 He Guoqiang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and Secretary of&#13;
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, made a speech about the problem of&#13;
corruption in China that explicitly mentioned corruption in the dibao program, which he&#13;
referred to using the phrase â&#128;&#156;a tide of unhealthy practices in urban and rural dibao ( chengxiang&#13;
dibao zhongde buzheng zhi feng)â&#128;&#157; (Zhu Wurong 2012). He outlined major reasons for these&#13;
problems: â&#128;&#156;first, local village and township cadres donâ&#128;&#153;t do their jobs, they donâ&#128;&#153;t go out to the&#13;
villages and meet with the people, donâ&#128;&#153;t really understand and grasp which are the households&#13;
in difficulty; second, dibao work is not sufficiently transparent and open; and third, a few village&#13;
and township cadres are selfish and looking out for their own benefit, and they give dibao&#13;
benefits to relatives, friends, or even themselves.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
       The Ministry of Civil Affairs has openly acknowledged the existence of such irregularities&#13;
and called for improvements in dibao work. A recent news report published comments by the&#13;
Minister of Civil Affairs regarding the findings of an internal review of the dibao program. The&#13;
Minister reported that the review found cases of cheating, mistakes, and awards based on&#13;
connections, but concluded that the overall incidence of such problems is relatively small. The&#13;
internal review estimated that the rate of incorrect/mistaken dibao benefits was 4% (Xinhuanet&#13;
2013). The basis of this estimate is not explained.&#13;
       To address problems in dibao implementation, in early 2013 the Ministry of Civil Affairs&#13;
announced some new policies that were to be adopted nationwide. The new policies include&#13;
(1) allowing households to apply for dibao benefits directly to the county Department of Civil&#13;
Affairs rather than having to go through the village and township levels, (2) requiring that&#13;
county-level officials visit and check at least 30% of applications, (3) instituting a filing and&#13;
auditing system for close relatives of local officials and village leaders involved in dibao&#13;
implementation, (4) establishing and improving systems for community feedback, and (5)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 10&#13;
&amp;#12;establishing a systematic mechanism for checking information on dibao applications against&#13;
information in other departments, e.g., vehicle registration data and savings account&#13;
information (Xinhuanet 2013).&#13;
        These sorts of reports reveal divergence between policies and implementation.&#13;
Although it is difficult to know exactly the extent of such divergence, the reports raise questions&#13;
about the rural dibao programâ&#128;&#153;s performance, targeting, and impact on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 III.   Data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For our analysis we use two types of data. First, we use rural household survey data for the&#13;
years 2007, 2008 and 2009 collected by the China Household Income Project (CHIP) in&#13;
conjunction with the Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) project. Hereafter we will refer&#13;
to these as the CHIP data. During the years covered by the CHIP data the rural dibao program&#13;
expanded rapidly nationwide. As of 2009, coverage was about 90% of the programâ&#128;&#153;s level at full&#13;
implementation of 53-54 million, which was attained after 2010.                 Second, we use&#13;
administrative data published by the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) on rural dibao thresholds,&#13;
transfers and expenditures. The MOCA data are available at the county level. We use the&#13;
MOCA data for counties covered in the CHIP survey to create a matched dataset. There are 82&#13;
counties covered in the CHIP rural survey and for 77 we are able to match county-level&#13;
information from MOCA.&#13;
        The CHIP rural survey sample is a panel of about 8000 rural households containing&#13;
30,000 individuals in nine provinces (Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong,&#13;
Chongqing and Sichuan). These nine provinces cover nearly half of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s total population and&#13;
span Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s eastern, central and western regions. Table 2 shows the sample size for each year&#13;
and gives information on the panel aspect of the dataset. Ninety-eight percent of households&#13;
and ninety-three percent of individuals in the sample are present in the dataset for all three&#13;
years. In this paper we do not exploit the panel aspect of the dataset, but we plan to do so in&#13;
future work.&#13;
        A detailed description of the CHIP sample can be found in Li, Sato and Sicular (2013).&#13;
Here we highlight key features relevant to our analysis. The CHIP sample is a subset of the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                11&#13;
&amp;#12;National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) annual rural household survey sample, which covers 68,000&#13;
households in all 31 provinces. Like the larger NBS rural sample from which it is drawn, the&#13;
CHIP sample is representative at the provincial level. CHIPâ&#128;&#153;s provincial sample sizes are not&#13;
proportional to the provincial populations. For this reason, and also because of the deliberate&#13;
selection of provinces covered by CHIP so as to represent Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s three major regions (eastern,&#13;
central, western), for most analyses we use two-level weights reflecting the provincial and&#13;
regional populations. Weights are constructed using population statistics from Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s annual&#13;
1% population sample surveys (NBS, various years).&#13;
        The nine provinces in the 2007-09 CHIP sample exclude the Northeast and Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
autonomous regions in the Northwest and Southwest. These autonomous regions contain&#13;
relatively high concentrations of the poor, which may explain in part why the CHIP dataset has&#13;
lower poverty rates than the full NBS sample. Based on the 2009 official poverty line and the&#13;
full NBS national rural household survey data for 2009, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s poverty rate was 4.7%; using the&#13;
same poverty threshold and (weighted) CHIP rural data, the poverty rate is 3.2%.1&#13;
        The nine provinces covered in the CHIP sample also have lower concentrations of dibao&#13;
participants than is the case nationwide according to the official data. In 2009 the nine&#13;
provinces covered by the CHIP rural sample contained 47% of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural population but only&#13;
38% of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao recipients.2 Nevertheless, the mean values of key variables such as&#13;
income are similar to those in the full NBS sample (Table 2; Li, Sato and Sicular 2013). Thus,&#13;
with careful interpretation in light of sample coverage, the CHIP data provide a reasonable&#13;
approximation of the situation in much of China.&#13;
        The CHIP dataset contains detailed information on incomes, consumption, household&#13;
composition and demographics, and many other (but not all) variables collected by the NBS as&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  These estimates were kindly provided by Luo Chuliang. Note that these poverty rates are calculated using the&#13;
2009 official poverty line, which is lower than the 2011 official poverty line that we use to calculate estimates&#13;
reported in the next section.&#13;
2&#13;
  Population data from NBS (various years). Provincial and national rural dibao data are for the month of&#13;
December, 2009, and are published on the Ministry of Civil Affairs website. Note that in December 2008 the nine&#13;
provinces contained 36% of rural dibao recipients in China. See&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                12&#13;
&amp;#12;part of its annual rural household survey. Additional information about the households was&#13;
collected using an independent questionnaire designed by the researchers associated with the&#13;
CHIP and RUMiC. The dataset contains matching community-level data gathered through a&#13;
village survey. The availability of rich information at the individual, household and village levels&#13;
provides a unique resource for our analysis.&#13;
        The income data were collected using a diary method. Although the diary method&#13;
reduces recall error, the income data contain some unknown degree of measurement error.&#13;
Error could arise due to difficulties keeping track of the complex and diverse income sources in&#13;
rural China, which include farming, nonagricultural self-employment, formal wage employment,&#13;
and informal or casual jobs, and which generate incomes both in cash and in kind. Error could&#13;
also arise due differences in the ability and willingness of respondents to record accurate data&#13;
in the diaries.&#13;
        The CHIP datasets contain information on household participation in the dibao and&#13;
wubao programs. Participation is self-reported. In our analyses we treat households that&#13;
indicated participation in either the dibao or wubao programs as dibao households and their&#13;
members as dibao participants, because the distinction between the two programs is not&#13;
always clear at the local level and because during the time frame of our analysis the wubao&#13;
program was to some extent being absorbed by the dibao program (World Bank Social&#13;
Protection Group 2010).&#13;
        Table 2 shows the number of dibao (including wubao) households and individuals in the&#13;
CHIP datasets. The numbers of dibao households and individuals increase markedly over the&#13;
three years, reflecting the expansion of the program during this time frame. The numbers of&#13;
dibao households and individuals are adequate for analysis at the national level, but with&#13;
disaggregation the numbers quickly become too small. Consequently, our analysis is carried&#13;
out primarily at the national level.&#13;
        In order to evaluate the dibao programâ&#128;&#153;s targeting performance and poverty impacts,&#13;
we need to estimate the â&#128;&#156;ex anteâ&#128;&#157; or counterfactual level of income that households would&#13;
have had in the absence of the dibao transfers. Here we estimate ex ante income as equal to&#13;
reported or â&#128;&#156;ex postâ&#128;&#157; income minus the amount of dibao transfers received by the household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 13&#13;
&amp;#12;This approach assumes that households that the dibao transfers do not change household&#13;
behavior.&#13;
        It is widely recognized that households that receive transfers are likely to alter their&#13;
behavior, for example, by reducing effort to earn income. If this is the case for rural dibao&#13;
recipient households, our estimates of ex ante income will understate the true counterfactual&#13;
income that households would have had in the absence of the transfer.                       Consequently, our&#13;
estimates of ex ante income are likely to be too low, thus exaggerating the difference between&#13;
ex post and ex ante incomes and leading to overstatement of the impact of the dibao program&#13;
on incomes and on poverty. As shall be seen in later sections, we find that despite this possible&#13;
overstatement, the impact of the dibao program on poverty rates is relatively small.&#13;
        The CHIP household survey data contain ex post incomes, but unfortunately they do not&#13;
contain information on the amounts of dibao transfers received by the households. 3&#13;
Information about dibao transfers is, however, available at the village and county levels. The&#13;
CHIP village-level data contain information for 2008 and 2009 on the number of dibao and&#13;
wubao households within the village and on the average dibao transfer per recipient within the&#13;
village. Also, MOCA publishes county-level data on rural dibao participation and expenditures,&#13;
which can be used to calculate county average dibao expenditures per recipient.4 It is possible&#13;
that county expenditures include some categories of government spending on the dibao&#13;
program other than the dibao transfers to households; as discussed later, however, the county&#13;
average dibao expenditures are quite similar to the village average transfers.&#13;
        We use the local village average dibao transfers and county average dibao expenditures&#13;
amounts as proxies for household level dibao transfers. In this way we obtain two estimates of&#13;
ex ante income for dibao households: one is equal to ex post household income per capita&#13;
3&#13;
  The data contain information on the total transfer income received by the households, including both private and&#13;
public transfers, but without any breakdown of the total transfer income by source or type of transfer. We found&#13;
no correlation between total transfers received by households and their dibao participation.&#13;
4&#13;
  MOCA publishes county-level dibao data on a monthly basis. In our analyses for 2008 and 2009, we use year-end&#13;
(December) values of the MOCA county-level dibao participation and expenditure levels to calculate monthly dibao&#13;
expenditures per recipient. To obtain annual dibao expenditures, we multiply the December amounts by twelve.&#13;
These estimates therefore capture the level of transfers per capita attained by the end of the calendar year. Since&#13;
the MOCA county-level data are not available for 2007, for 2007 we use the January 2008 county-level data,&#13;
multiplied by twelve. We compared the January versus December values of the MOCA dibao variables for later&#13;
years (December 2008 versus January 2009, and December 2009 versus January 2010) and did not find systematic&#13;
differences.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                14&#13;
&amp;#12;minus the village average dibao transfer, and the other is equal to ex post income per capita&#13;
minus the county average dibao expenditure.5 This approach effectively assumes an egalitarian&#13;
distribution within villages or within counties of dibao benefits among dibao recipients.6&#13;
          The dibao participation rates in the CHIP rural survey are lower than the aggregate rates&#13;
implied by official data.7 To some extent this reflects the selection of provinces in the CHIP&#13;
sample, but the discrepancy remains even for the nine CHIP provinces (to be discussed in more&#13;
detail below). The reason why the CHIP sample has lower dibao participation rates than the&#13;
official data is not clear. It is possible that dibao households are under-sampled in the CHIP&#13;
survey. Under-sampling of poor householdsâ&#128;&#148;which are presumably more likely to be dibao&#13;
recipientsâ&#128;&#148;is a known feature of the NBS household survey samples from which the CHIP&#13;
samples are drawn. It is also possible that some dibao households do not report their dibao&#13;
participation. Households may not be aware that the transfers they received were from the&#13;
dibao program, or they may not want to disclose their participation in the program. A third&#13;
possibility is that the official numbers overstate true participation rates. It is widely accepted&#13;
that local-level governments in China massage the statistics that they report to higher levels so&#13;
as to appear to comply with central government policy targets and in order to obscure local&#13;
irregularities in program implementation (Hvistendahl 2013).&#13;
&#13;
    IV.   Patterns of income inequality and poverty in rural China, 2007-09&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the period 2007-2009 inequality increased and poverty decreased in rural China. Table&#13;
3 shows estimates of several measures of inequality calculated using household net income per&#13;
capita as reported in the CHIP data with population weights. For all measures, inequality&#13;
increased between 2007 and 2009, with the overall increase ranging from 6 to 19%, depending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
  In the few cases of missing village-level (county-level) data we use county-level (village-level) information to&#13;
impute missing values.&#13;
6&#13;
  In fact, most villages and counties contain multiple dibao households. In future work we may explore whether&#13;
different assumptions about the distribution of transfers yields different conclusions; however, even with the&#13;
assumption of egalitarian distribution of transfers within villages or counties, we find that the dibao program is&#13;
quite successful in reducing poverty among recipient households, and the modest overall impact of the program&#13;
on poverty is due to insufficient coverage, rather than insufficient transfers to covered households.&#13;
7&#13;
  Gao, Garfinkel and Zhai (2009) find that in the CHIP urban data (for 2002) the rate of dibao participation is also&#13;
lower than the officially reported rate.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                       15&#13;
&amp;#12;on the measure. The increase is smaller for the Gini coefficient than for the Mean Log&#13;
Deviation (MLD) index, the Theil index, and the dispersion ratios, which place more weight on&#13;
the tails of the distribution. The decile dispersion ratio, for example, increased by 19%, and the&#13;
quintile dispersion ratio by 13%.&#13;
       For purposes of comparison, Table 3 gives estimates of inequality published by the NBS.&#13;
The NBSâ&#128;&#153;s estimates of the rural Gini coefficient are higher than ours by 6 to 8%, and the NBSâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
quintile dispersion ratios are also higher, by about 20%. The discrepancy between the NBS and&#13;
our estimates of the Gini is not surprising given the provincial coverage of the CHIP dataset;&#13;
however, the discrepancy between the NBS and our estimates of the quintile dispersion ratio is&#13;
larger than expected. Regardless, none of the estimates of inequality in Table 3 is overly high.&#13;
All estimates of the Gini coefficient, for example, are below 0.40, indicating a moderately low&#13;
degree of inequality in rural China.&#13;
       Inequality increases over time for both the CHIP and official estimates. From 2007 to&#13;
2009 the NBSâ&#128;&#153;s rural Gini coefficient increased by about 3%, as compared to 6% for CHIP, and&#13;
the NBSâ&#128;&#153;s quintile dispersion ratio increased by 9%, as compared to 13% for CHIP.&#13;
       Figure 1 shows the growth incidence curve, a plot of annual income growth (in constant&#13;
prices) between 2007 and 2009 for each percentile group in the income distribution, arranged&#13;
in order from the poorest to the richest decile. This figure is constructed using the CHIP data.&#13;
       Figure 1 reveals that from 2007 to 2009 the poorest percentiles experienced negative&#13;
income growth. At the third percentile income growth becomes positive; at the seventh&#13;
percentile it reaches 5% per year. As one moves further up the income distribution, the rate of&#13;
income growth rises above 10%.         For most percentiles in the top 40% of the income&#13;
distribution, income growth is close to or exceeds 10% per year. Overall, Figure 1 shows that&#13;
during this period, incomes of poorer groups lagged behind those of middle- and high-income&#13;
groups, a pattern consistent with rising inequality as reported in Table 3.&#13;
       For estimates of absolute poverty, we use three different poverty lines. First, we use&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s official poverty line as of 2011 (adjusted back to 2007, 2008 and 2009 using the national&#13;
rural consumer price index).        We use the 2011 official poverty line rather than the&#13;
contemporaneous official poverty lines because before China made a large upward adjustment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   16&#13;
&amp;#12;to the official poverty line in 2011, before which time the official poverty line was widely&#13;
regarded as too low (World Bank 2009). We also use the $1.25 and $2 per person per day&#13;
international poverty thresholds based on purchasing power parity (PPP) income. We note that&#13;
the $1.25 poverty line is not much different from the 2011 official poverty line. Finally, we use&#13;
two relative poverty lines that are equal to 50% and 60% of median income in each year. Table&#13;
4 shows these poverty lines in current prices and explains their construction.&#13;
       Table 5 shows our estimates of poverty incidence calculated using the CHIP data and the&#13;
poverty lines in Table 4. For all three absolute poverty lines, poverty incidence declined&#13;
substantially from 2007 to 2009. For the official poverty line, for example, the poverty rate in&#13;
2009 was 25% lower than in 2007.&#13;
       Although absolute poverty declined, relative poverty increased. For both of our relative&#13;
poverty lines, poverty incidence increased by more than 10% from 2007 to 2009. The different&#13;
direction of change in absolute and relative poverty rates reflects that although the absolute&#13;
level of income of the poor grew, their income growth was slower than that of higher income&#13;
groups (as evident in Figure 1).&#13;
       The poverty gap is a measure of the amount of funding that would be needed eliminate&#13;
poverty if transfers could be perfectly targeted to individuals below the poverty line, and in&#13;
amounts exactly equal to their income shortfalls below the poverty line.           Table 6 gives&#13;
estimates of the poverty gap calculated for the three absolute poverty lines. In all cases the&#13;
poverty gap declined between 2007 and 2009. For example, measured using the official&#13;
poverty line, the poverty gap declined from 61 trillion yuan in 2007 to 59 in 2008 and 56 in&#13;
2009. In real terms, this was equivalent to a decline of 10% decline in 2008 and of an additional&#13;
5% in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
 V.    Patterns of dibao participation, thresholds and transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The levels of inequality and poverty outlined in the last section provide a context for evaluating&#13;
the rural dibao program. In this section, using the CHIP household data combined with MOCA&#13;
statistics, we describe the patterns of dibao thresholds, transfers, and participation, with some&#13;
comparisons to poverty lines and poverty incidence.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;       Consistent with national dibao policies, our data show substantial expansion of the&#13;
dibao program since 2007. The mean dibao threshold, calculated using MOCA county-level&#13;
data for all provinces, increased from 1,064 yuan per capita in 2007 to 1,428 yuan per capita in&#13;
2009 (Table 7). The mean dibao transfer per capita also increased (Table 7). Dibao transfers&#13;
were, on average, somewhat lower than Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s official poverty lines at the time (785 yuan in&#13;
2007, 1,067 yuan in 2008, and 1,196 yuan in 2009), and also lower than the 2011 official&#13;
poverty line that we use in our analysis (Table 4). Table 7 also shows the average dibao&#13;
thresholds for the nine provinces covered in the CHIP sample; these are similar to the national&#13;
averages.&#13;
       According to official policy, the dibao thresholds are set locally and so can vary across&#13;
counties. The MOCA county-level data indeed show substantial variation in thresholds. Figure&#13;
2 is a graph of the distribution of county dibao thresholds in current prices for the CHIP sample&#13;
counties in each of the three sample years. In 2007 and 2008 the county dibao thresholds&#13;
ranged from less than 500 yuan per capita per year to more than 3,000 yuan. In 2009 the&#13;
lowest thresholds had risen above 500 yuan, and the highest to more than 4,000 yuan.&#13;
       Figures 3a and 3b show the distributions of dibao transfer amounts in the CHIP sample&#13;
counties for 2008 and 2009. The distributions based on the county-level averages from MOCA&#13;
data and on the village-level averages from CHIP are similar, although variation is wider at the&#13;
village level (to be expected because averaging at the county level eliminates variation within&#13;
counties). As is the case for the thresholds, variation in the dibao transfers is substantial. In&#13;
2009, for example, county average dibao transfers ranged from less than 500 to more than&#13;
3,000 yuan per capita.&#13;
       Dibao participation increased along with dibao thresholds and transfer amounts.&#13;
Calculated using the CHIP data, the rate of participation in the rural dibao program increased&#13;
from 1.9% in 2007 to 3.0% in 2009 (Table 8). Dibao participation rates in the CHIP data are&#13;
lower than national participation rates implied by the MOCA statistics, which increased from&#13;
5.0% of the rural population in 2007 to 6.9% in 2009. Possible reasons for discrepancies&#13;
between the CHIP and official dibao statistics include those discussed earlier. These dibao&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;participation rates are also substantially lower than poverty rates calculated using the CHIP&#13;
data (Table 5).&#13;
       Geographic variation in dibao participation rates is considerable (Table 8). In 2009 dibao&#13;
participation rates (calculated using the CHIP data) ranged from less than 1% in Hebei and&#13;
Zhejiang provinces to 5 or 6% in Guangdong and Chongqing. Variation in participation rates is&#13;
also evident in the official data. Such variation reflects differences across locations in dibao&#13;
thresholds, financing and implementation, as well as differences in incomes and thus eligibility.&#13;
       The fact that dibao thresholds vary, and that they tend to be lower in poorer than richer&#13;
counties, raises the question of whether dibao participation rates are in fact higher for lower&#13;
income groups. Using the CHIP data, we calculate dibao participation rates by ex ante income&#13;
decile for 2007, 2008, and 2009, shown in Figure 4. The blue lines represent the distribution&#13;
based on estimates of ex ante income that subtract village average dibao transfers per capita,&#13;
and the red lines are based on estimates that subtract county average dibao expenditures per&#13;
capita. Village-level data are not available for 2007; for 2008 and 2009 the two estimates yield&#13;
similar patterns of participation rates across the income distribution.&#13;
       Figure 4 reveals that, in general, dibao participation rates are higher for poorer income&#13;
groups. In all three years the participation rates are highest for individuals in the poorest decile&#13;
of the income distribution. Dibao participation drops sharply for the second poorest decile, and&#13;
thereafter tends to decline further as one moves to higher income groups. In all years,&#13;
however, less than 10% of individuals in the poorest decile are dibao participants. Moreover, in&#13;
all years dibao participation is evident for all income deciles, including the very richest.&#13;
       With expansion of the dibao program over time, the pattern of participation has shifted&#13;
more towards poorer income groups (Figure 4). Between 2007 and 2009 participation rates&#13;
increased for most income groups, with relatively large increases for the bottom deciles.&#13;
Participation rates, however, also rose for middle deciles. For the richest four deciles, changes&#13;
in participation rates were small and remained below 2% in all three years. Figure 4 reveals&#13;
that even though poorer groups are more likely to participate in the dibao program,&#13;
participation by middle-income and richer deciles is nontrivial. This pattern suggests leakage in&#13;
targeting, which we explore later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 19&#13;
&amp;#12;VI.    Impact of dibao transfers on incomes and poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Do dibao transfers provide a minimum income guarantee, that is, do they bring household&#13;
incomes up to the level of local dibao thresholds? Do they reduce rural poverty, and if so, to&#13;
what extent? Here we provide answers to these questions through comparisons of ex ante and&#13;
ex post incomes. As explained earlier, our estimates of ex ante income are equal to reported&#13;
income minus the amount of the dibao transfer, which implicitly assumes that the receipt of&#13;
dibao transfers does not change household behavior. Our estimates of the impact of the dibao&#13;
program on incomes and poverty are therefore probably overstated.&#13;
       Did the rural dibao program provide a minimum income guarantee? In order to answer&#13;
this question, we compare ex ante and ex post incomes of individuals whose incomes were&#13;
below the local (county) dibao threshold. Table 9 gives the percentages of individuals in the&#13;
CHIP sample with ex ante and ex post incomes below the local dibao thresholds in each of the&#13;
three years. The first three rows classify individuals using ex post incomes; the second three&#13;
rows using ex ante incomes calculated using village average transfers; and the bottom three&#13;
rows using ex ante incomes calculated using county average transfers.&#13;
       The first column shows the percentages of all individuals in the CHIP sample, including&#13;
both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, whose incomes were below the dibao thresholds. The&#13;
percentage of individuals whose ex post income was below the dibao thresholds increased over&#13;
time from 2.4% in 2007 to 2.6% in 2008 and further to 3.8% in 2009. This increase is somewhat&#13;
surprising given the dramatic expansion of dibao participation and transfers during these years;&#13;
however, dibao thresholds were also raised. Examination of ex ante incomes reveals that&#13;
eligibility rates also increased: from 2007 to 2009 the share of individuals in the CHIP sample&#13;
with ex ante incomes (calculated using county average transfers) below the local dibao&#13;
thresholds rose from 2.5% to 4.1%.&#13;
       Did the dibao program provide a minimum income guarantee? In all three years the&#13;
percentage of dibao recipients with ex ante incomes below the dibao thresholds exceeded the&#13;
percentage with ex post incomes below the thresholds. For example, in 2009 more than 12% of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             20&#13;
&amp;#12;dibao recipients had ex ante income below the dibao thresholds, and only 5.7% had ex post&#13;
income below the dibao thresholds. In other words, the dibao transfers raised more than half&#13;
of dibao recipients who started out below the dibao threshold above the threshold. We&#13;
conclude that the rural dibao program was reasonably successful in providing an income&#13;
guarantee for dibao recipients whose pre-transfer income was below their local dibao&#13;
threshold.&#13;
       Of course, these numbers ignore non-recipients whose incomes were below the dibao&#13;
thresholds. About 90% of individuals with income below the threshold did not receive dibao&#13;
transfers.   For these individuals, the dibao program did not provide a minimum income&#13;
guarantee. The lack of guarantee to this group reflects a substantial exclusionary error in&#13;
targeting, which we discuss in the next section.&#13;
       Did the dibao program reduce poverty? We answer this question by comparing poverty&#13;
incidence and the poverty gap calculated using ex ante versus ex post incomes. As shown in&#13;
Table 10, which reports estimates of poverty incidence calculated using our three absolute&#13;
poverty lines, in all cases poverty incidence was higher for ex ante incomes than for ex post&#13;
incomes. This is consistent with a poverty-reducing impact of the dibao program. In all cases,&#13;
however, the difference in ex ante versus ex post poverty incidence is smaller than half a&#13;
percentage point. In other words, the dibao program apparently had a negligible impact on&#13;
poverty incidence.&#13;
       Table 11 shows estimates of the poverty gap calculated using ex ante incomes and ex&#13;
post incomes. As expected, the poverty gap calculated using ex ante is larger than that&#13;
calculated using ex post incomes, which include the dibao transfers. In 2007 and 2008 the ex&#13;
ante poverty gap was 2-3% larger than the ex post poverty gap, and in 2009 it was 6.5% larger.&#13;
Again, however, the difference is modest, especially when compared to total dibao&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
       According to the official data, in 2007 total dibao expenditures were equivalent to 18%&#13;
of the ex ante poverty gap; by 2009 total dibao expenditures had risen to 64% of the ex ante&#13;
poverty gap. The reduction in the poverty gap per yuan dibao expenditure was therefore fairly&#13;
small. In 2007 each yuan of dibao expenditures was associated with a reduction in the poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           21&#13;
&amp;#12;gap of 0.13 yuan. In 2009 each yuan of dibao expenditures was associated with a reduction in&#13;
the poverty gap of 0.10 yuan.&#13;
        Dibao participation in the CHIP sample is lower than that reported in official statistics,&#13;
and it may be more appropriate to evaluate the programâ&#128;&#153;s poverty impact using the level of&#13;
dibao expenditures implied in the CHIP data. We calculate total dibao expenditures implied by&#13;
the CHIP data as equal to the weighted sum of county level transfers times the number of dibao&#13;
recipients within each county (see note to Table 11). 8 By this calculation, total dibao&#13;
expenditures are substantially lower than the official numbers. In 2009, for example, they are&#13;
only 36% of the official total.&#13;
        Even using these lower estimates of total dibao expenditures, the poverty impact of the&#13;
dibao program remains modest. In 2009, for example, dibao expenditures implied by the the&#13;
CHIP data were equivalent to 26% of the ex ante poverty gap, but the poverty gap calculated&#13;
using ex post incomes was only 6.5% lower than that calculated using ex ante incomes. Each&#13;
yuan of dibao expenditures was associated with a reduction in the poverty gap of only 0.24&#13;
yuan.     These discrepancies between dibao expenditures and poverty reduction suggest&#13;
leakages in targeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VII.    Conventional analysis of dibao targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What is the extent of inclusionary targeting error, that is, to what extent do dibao benefits go to&#13;
individuals with ex ante incomes above the dibao thresholds? The dibao programâ&#128;&#153;s stated goal&#13;
is to assist households with incomes below the dibao thresholds, so inclusionary targeting error&#13;
is a relevant criterion for evaluation of the program. What is the extent of exclusionary error,&#13;
that is, to what extent are individuals with ex ante incomes below the dibao thresholds&#13;
excluded from the program? The dibao program does not claim to cover all individuals with&#13;
incomes below the dibao threshold, so exclusionary error may not measure the success of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
 For dibao recipients who live in counties for which MOCA county-level transfer data are missing, we use the&#13;
village average transfers from CHIP.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               22&#13;
&amp;#12;dibao program in meeting its own objectives.             Nevertheless, analysis of the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exclusionary targeting error is informative.&#13;
       Table 12 contains estimates of inclusionary and exclusionary targeting error of the dibao&#13;
program calculated using local dibao thresholds as the targeting criterion. Targeting errors&#13;
have declined over the three years. For example, based on estimates using the county average&#13;
dibao expenditures, from 2007 to 2009 inclusionary error declined from 94% to 86%, and&#13;
exclusionary error from 94% to 89%. Despite these improvements, the overwhelming majority&#13;
of dibao beneficiaries had ex ante incomes higher than the local dibao thresholds. Moreover,&#13;
the dibao program reached only a small proportion (11% or less) of individuals with ex ante&#13;
incomes below the dibao thresholds. In all years, then, it appears that the vast majority of&#13;
eligible individuals did not benefit from the program.&#13;
       By comparison, for Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s urban dibao program Chen, Ravallion and Wang (2006)&#13;
report an inclusionary error of 43% and an exclusionary error of 71%. Although based on data&#13;
for earlier years, their estimates suggest that the targeting performance of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s urban dibao&#13;
program is markedly better than that of the rural dibao program. Weaker performance of the&#13;
rural dibao program is not overly surprising given the uneven capacity and resources of local&#13;
governments in rural China, as well as the difficulty of measuring rural incomes.&#13;
       The targeting performance of the rural dibao program can also be evaluated relative to&#13;
the poverty line so as to ascertain the extent to which the program benefited the poor versus&#13;
nonpoor. Table 13 shows the shares of the poor and nonpoor who received dibao benefits.&#13;
These shares are calculated using our three poverty lines and ex ante incomes. In all cases, less&#13;
than 10% of the poor received dibao transfers. A higher proportion of the poor than nonpoor,&#13;
however, were dibao recipients.        For example, based on the official poverty line, the&#13;
percentage of the poor receiving dibao benefits in 2009 was 8%, versus less than 3% of the&#13;
nonpoor. Also, the proportion of the poor who received dibao benefits increased over time.&#13;
For example, based on the official poverty line, the share of the poor receiving dibao benefits&#13;
increased from 4.7% in 2007 to 8.0% in 2009.&#13;
       How well does the dibao program target poor households?              Table 14 shows the&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors calculated using ex ante incomes in relation to the official&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              23&#13;
&amp;#12;poverty line. The inclusion error is between 64 and 75%, depending on the estimate and year.&#13;
That is, between 64 and 75% of dibao recipients were not poor. The exclusion error is between&#13;
92 and 95%, indicating that the overwhelming majority of the poor did not benefit from the&#13;
dibao program.&#13;
&#13;
VIII.   Correlates of dibao participation and propensity score analysis of dibao targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Our conventional analysis of dibao targeting implicitly assumes that the local officials who&#13;
implement the program select program beneficiaries based on current year household&#13;
incomes, that their information about those incomes is the same as that collected by the NBS&#13;
and reported in the CHIP survey, and that these income data are accurate. As discussed by&#13;
Chen, Ravallion and Wang (2006), these assumptions may not be correct. Local officials who&#13;
implement the dibao program do not have access to detailed income data such as that&#13;
collected by the NBS, and even if they did, the NBS income data contain some unknown degree&#13;
of measurement error. In reality, local officials are likely to select beneficiaries based on some&#13;
measure of permanent income rather than current income, and based on observable correlates&#13;
of income. Indeed, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s national rural dibao policies allow for such practices, and local&#13;
regulations explicitly mention alternative criteria for identifying recipients.&#13;
        In view of these considerations, Chen, Ravallion and Wang (2006) propose an approach&#13;
based on the idea that local officials select beneficiaries on the basis of a latent income variable&#13;
that is correlated with ex ante income as measured in the survey as well as other characteristics&#13;
and an error term. Local officials select households whose latent income is below the dibao&#13;
threshold as beneficiaries. Targeting analysis can then be carried out on the basis of latent&#13;
household incomes (Ravallion 2008).&#13;
        The first step is to estimate a probit regression with dibao participation as the&#13;
dependent variable and with ex ante income and other relevant attributes as measured in the&#13;
survey data as the independent variables. The other attributes are chosen based on local&#13;
implementation practices and include household characteristics such as demographic&#13;
composition, health of household members, and human and physical capital or assets. Second,&#13;
the results of the probit model are used to predict a conditional probability of program&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 24&#13;
&amp;#12;assignment (the propensity score). The estimated coefficients from the probit regression&#13;
provide weights placed on the different characteristics; these correspond to the implicit&#13;
weights assigned by program administrators when deciding on beneficiaries. Third, a cutoff is&#13;
determined based on the observed coverage rate. Beneficiaries are selected by counting off&#13;
households ranked from highest to lowest propensity score until the cutoff is reached. The&#13;
selected households are used to calculate the targeting errors.&#13;
       Here we carry out such an analysis using the CHIP survey data. We note that in this&#13;
analysis, including the probit regressions and calculations of propensity scores and targeting&#13;
errors, we use households as the unit of analysis.&#13;
       Tables 15, 16 and 17 contain descriptive statistics (unweighted) for attributes associated&#13;
with rural dibao implementation. Comparison of dibao and nondibao households reveals&#13;
differences in mean incomes as well as other attributes, although not all differences are&#13;
statistically significant. Both ex post and ex ante incomes of dibao households are, on average,&#13;
lower than those of nondibao households. A smaller share of the income of dibao households&#13;
is from wage employment, and in 2007 and 2008 (but not 2009) dibao households are less likely&#13;
to have a member engaged in migrant work than nondibao households. Household size is&#13;
smaller for dibao households, and they contain markedly higher shares of elderly members and&#13;
of bad health and disability. In 2007, for example, 20% of dibao households contained a family&#13;
member over the age of 60, 41% contained a member in bad health and 35% contained a&#13;
member with a disability, as compared to 10%, 14% and 12%, respectively, for nondibao&#13;
households.&#13;
       Differences also exist in ownership of physical assets. Housing conditions, as measured&#13;
by whether housing is multi-storey and the presence of piped water and flush toilets, are&#13;
poorer for dibao households. Ownership of durable goods such as household appliances and&#13;
motorized vehicles is lower.&#13;
       Tables 15-17 also reveal that the communities in which dibao households live are&#13;
somewhat different from those of nondibao households. A higher share of dibao households&#13;
live in villages that are located in mountainous areas, do not have a paved road, are distant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;from the nearest township government, and experienced some sort of natural disaster in the&#13;
survey year.&#13;
        Probit regressions reveal that many of the characteristics in Tables 15-17 are statistically&#13;
significant predictors of dibao status. Table 18 reports the estimated marginal effects of the&#13;
probit regressions. Specification 1 uses ex ante income calculated using village average dibao&#13;
transfers, and specification 2 uses ex ante income calculated using county average dibao&#13;
expenditures.9&#13;
        In all years the probability of receiving dibao benefits has a significant, negative&#13;
association with household income. The marginal effects imply that a 1% increase in ex ante&#13;
income reduces the probability of receiving dibao by 0.7 to 1.0 percentage points. Other&#13;
characteristics that are consistently significant in most years and specifications are: household&#13;
size (negative), bad health (positive), disability (positive), the share of wages in income&#13;
(negative), share of income from non-agricultural business (negative), and absence of a major&#13;
appliance (positive).&#13;
    The estimated coefficients change somewhat across the years. Notably, more variables are&#13;
significant in 2009 than in the earlier two years. For example, the share of elderly becomes&#13;
significant (positive) in 2009, indicating that selection criteria may have changed to emphasize&#13;
households with elderly family members.               The presence of a migrant worker (positive),&#13;
marriages (negative), deaths (positive), and cultivated land area (negative) also become&#13;
significant in 2009. These changes may reflect the refinement of, or adaptation in, the criteria&#13;
used by local officials to decide on eligibility for the program, or perhaps smaller standard&#13;
errors in our estimates due to the larger number of dibao households in the 2009 sample than&#13;
in 2007 and 2008. Also, the expansion of the dibao program during this time period may have&#13;
allowed the widening of eligibility criteria to include more characteristics.&#13;
    Tables 19 and 20 show the results of the propensity score analysis of targeting&#13;
performance. In 2007 17% of households selected as eligible based on propensity scores&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 We also estimated the probits using ex post income because of concerns about measurement error in calculation&#13;
of ex ante income using village and county average dibao transfers. We found that the estimated coefficients on&#13;
ex post income were in fact smaller and the standard errors relatively bigger than those on our estimates of ex&#13;
ante income. We concluded that our estimates of ex ante income, despite their possible weakness, are useful for&#13;
this analysis.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             26&#13;
&amp;#12;received dibao benefits, as compared to 6% for the conventional targeting analysis based on&#13;
the dibao thresholds (see Table 12). In 2008 20% of eligible households and in 2009 17% of&#13;
eligible households received dibao benefits according to the propensity score approach, as&#13;
compared to 7% and 11% using the conventional approach.               Thus dibao coverage for&#13;
households classified as eligible using latent income as the selection criterion is substantially&#13;
higher than that implied by conventional targeting analysis.&#13;
   The inclusionary error for the propensity score method is also lower than that for&#13;
conventional targeting analysis.    83% of dibao recipients were not eligible based on the&#13;
propensity score in 2007, as compared to 94% in the conventional analysis; in 2008 and 2009&#13;
the propensity score inclusion errors are 80% and 83%, as compared to 92% and 86%,&#13;
respectively, for the conventional approach (Tables 12 and 20).         Thus dibao leakage to&#13;
households classified as ineligible using latent income as the selection criterion is lower than&#13;
that implied by conventional targeting analysis.&#13;
   All in all, the propensity score targeting analysis yields smaller targeting errors than&#13;
conventional targeting analysis. These findings are consistent with a situation in which local&#13;
officials rely on observable characteristics of the households to determine dibao eligibility, or&#13;
where local officialsâ&#128;&#153; perceptions of household income are not identical to CHIP income&#13;
estimates.&#13;
&#13;
 IX.   Policy simulations: Expand Coverage versus Increase Transfer Amounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In order to examine options for improving the impact of the rural dibao program, we conduct&#13;
some simple simulations using the 2009 CHIP data. A first set of simulations investigates how&#13;
expansion of the rural dibao program would affect the level of poverty. The rural dibao&#13;
program has in fact expanded since 2009. According to the official statistics (Table 1), in 2013&#13;
the total rural dibao budget was 2.4 times that in 2009. Most of the increase reflected higher&#13;
transfer amounts rather than wider coverage:        the average dibao transfer per recipient&#13;
doubled, while the number of recipients increased only 13%.&#13;
       Our simulations provide some insights into the potential consequences of such a&#13;
program expansion.      We explore the impact of expanding the program in two ways: by&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              27&#13;
&amp;#12;increasing the amount of dibao transfers going to existing dibao recipients, and by expanding&#13;
coverage to more recipients while keeping the transfer amounts unchanged. The first approach&#13;
should reduce poverty if most dibao beneficiaries are poor and if their transfer amounts are&#13;
insufficient to bring them above the poverty line.                    The second should reduce poverty if&#13;
exclusionary targeting error is substantial and transfer amounts are adequate. Based on&#13;
findings reported in previous sections of this paper, we expect that the second approach will&#13;
have a larger poverty impact than the first approach.&#13;
         This first set of simulations retains local variation in dibao eligibility thresholds and&#13;
dibao transfer amounts as observed in the 2009 CHIP data. We use the average transfer in the&#13;
householdâ&#128;&#153;s village of residence, as reported in the CHIP village-level survey, as the local&#13;
transfer amount.10 For the simulations, which involve the selection of recipient households&#13;
based on ex ante income, we estimate ex ante income by subtracting the local transfer from ex&#13;
post income as reported by households in the CHIP household-level survey. We calculate&#13;
poverty measures in relation to the official poverty line.11 All calculations are done using&#13;
weights.&#13;
         We begin by constructing a baseline case that reflects observed incomes and dibao&#13;
participation in the 2009 data. Baseline poverty levels are equal to those observed in the 2009&#13;
CHIP data, that is, they are the levels of poverty implied by ex post incomes in the data. The&#13;
dibao budget for the baseline case is equal to the (weighted) sum of local dibao transfer&#13;
amounts for all dibao recipients observed in the data.12 We refer to this as the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
baseline.&#13;
         The simulations require a decision about how much to expand the program. For&#13;
simplicity, we use a target budget equal to the amount of money that would be spent if the&#13;
program were expanded to cover all eligible individuals in 2009 who were not yet dibao&#13;
beneficiaries. In other words, we calculate the cost of providing local dibao transfers to all non-&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
   In cases where data for the village average dibao transfer are missing, we use the county average transfer.&#13;
11&#13;
   As elsewhere in this paper, the poverty line for 2009 is derived from the new official poverty line of 2300 yuan&#13;
announced in 2011. We adjust this back to 2009 using the rural consumer price index published by the NBS.&#13;
12&#13;
   Note that the dibao budget here does not equal the official number reported by MOCA, reflecting in part the&#13;
lower dibao participation rate in the CHIP sample than in the official statistics (see Table 11 and related text). Also,&#13;
the dibao budget here differs a bit from the CHIP total dibao expenditures in Table 11, which is calculated using&#13;
county average dibao expenditures. Here we use village average dibao transfers.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     28&#13;
&amp;#12;recipients whose per capita incomes were below the local dibao thresholds, and we add this&#13;
cost to the baseline dibao budget. This yields a target budget equal to 2.54 times the baseline&#13;
budget.&#13;
       Simulations of the impact of expanding the dibao program are shown in Table 21. For&#13;
the simulation with expanded coverage, we present two scenarios. Simulation (a) assumes&#13;
perfect targeting: all added dibao recipients have income below the dibao eligibility threshold&#13;
in their location of residence, in other words, zero inclusionary targeting error among added&#13;
recipients. Moreover, the target budget is just sufficient to ensure that in this simulation all&#13;
eligible individuals receive dibao transfers, so exclusionary targeting error is also zero.&#13;
Simulation (b) assumes no targeting: additional recipients are selected randomly from among&#13;
all non-recipients. Thus, there will be both inclusionary and exclusionary targeting error among&#13;
the added recipients. These two simulations can be interpreted as optimistic and pessimistic&#13;
targeting scenarios for expansion of coverage.&#13;
       The poverty results for simulations (a) and (b) reveal that expanding coverage has the&#13;
potential to substantially reduce poverty relative to the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; baseline, depending on how&#13;
the additional recipients are selected. If we assume optimistically that the new recipients are&#13;
selected using perfect targeting (simulation a), then the expansion reduces the poverty&#13;
headcount by more than 5%, the poverty gap by 24%, and the squared poverty gap by 17%. If&#13;
we assume random selection (simulation b), the expansion reduces poverty by at most 3%.&#13;
       Would increasing the transfer amount to baseline recipients be more effective than&#13;
expanding coverage? Simulation (c) shows the results of increasing transfers without changing&#13;
coverage. The poverty impact is modest: relative to the baseline poverty reduction at best 3%.&#13;
This impact is considerably smaller than that of expanding coverage when new recipients are&#13;
well targeted (simulation a), and similar to that of expanding coverage when new recipients are&#13;
randomly targeted (simulation b).&#13;
       We conclude that expanding coverage is a better policy choice than increasing transfer&#13;
amounts. Even if targeting is imperfect, so long as targeting practices do a better job than&#13;
random selection, expanding coverage should yield greater poverty reduction than increasing&#13;
transfer amounts. These simulations suggest that the large increase in the dibao budget&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             29&#13;
&amp;#12;observed between 2009 and 2013 could potentially yield substantial reductions in poverty&#13;
depth and intensity and a respectable reduction in the headcount if the additional funds were&#13;
used mainly to expand coverage rather than increase transfers, and if selection of new&#13;
recipients were well targeted. The actual expansion of the program from 2009 to 2013,&#13;
however, mainly increased transfer amounts.&#13;
&#13;
     X.   Policy simulation: Nationally uniform transfer and threshold&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In China dibao thresholds, transfers and rates of coverage vary locally and tend to be higher in&#13;
richer than in poorer counties.          Consequently, households above the official poverty line in&#13;
richer areas may be selected for dibao, while households below the poverty line in poorer areas&#13;
may be left out. Moreover, richer areas have greater fiscal capacity than poorer areas and can&#13;
provide larger dibao transfers (Ravallion, 2009).                 For these reasons some studies have&#13;
recommended that China adopt a nationally uniform threshold and more equal transfer&#13;
amounts (World Bank 2009).&#13;
          We investigate the impact of adopting a uniform transfer and uniform threshold with a&#13;
second set of simulations. For simulations of a uniform transfer, we set the transfer equal to&#13;
the average transfer amount in the relevant baseline simulation. For simulations of a uniform&#13;
threshold, we set the threshold equal to the official poverty line. Individuals are classified as&#13;
eligible for dibao if their ex ante income per capita is below the official poverty line.13&#13;
          We begin by replacing the locally diverse transfers in the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; baseline with a&#13;
uniform transfer equal to the average â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; transfer of 666 yuan. The dibao thresholds,&#13;
recipients and budget are identical to the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; baseline case. The outcome of this policy&#13;
is shown as simulation (d) in Table 21. Compared to the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; baseline, the poverty&#13;
headcount decreases very slightly, the poverty gap increases very slightly, and the squared&#13;
poverty gap is unchanged. These results suggest that, in the absence of any other policy&#13;
changes, adopting a uniform national transfer would yield minimal poverty gains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
  At 2,098 Yuan, the official poverty line is higher than the average dibao threshold; however, in some counties&#13;
the threshold exceeds this level. See Figure 2 and Table 7.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   30&#13;
&amp;#12;       One reason why simulation (d) has such a small impact on poverty is that dibao transfers&#13;
will only affect the level of poverty if the recipients are poor, but most of the recipients in this&#13;
simulation are above the poverty line. The recipients are the â&#128;&#156;observedâ&#128;&#157; recipients, so that&#13;
targeting is the same as that in the 2009 CHIP sample, which has a 75% inclusionary error (Table&#13;
14). Consequently, for three quarters of the dibao recipients in simulation (d), the poverty&#13;
impact of switching to a uniform transfer is zero.&#13;
       How would adopting a uniform transfer affect poverty if targeting was good? To answer&#13;
this question, we construct a new baseline case with perfect targeting relative to the observed&#13;
local dibao thresholds. For this â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline we assume that individuals&#13;
receive dibao transfers if and only if their ex ante incomes are below their local dibao&#13;
thresholds. In other words, all individuals who are dibao eligible, and no one else, receive&#13;
transfers. In this baseline the transfers are equal to the local transfer amounts. The dibao&#13;
budget implied by this â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline is 23.7 billion yuan. Poverty outcomes&#13;
are shown in Table 22.&#13;
       We now carry out a simulation that replaces the locally varying dibao transfers in the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline with a uniform transfer. The transfer is equal to the average&#13;
transfer (887 yuan) in the â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline. The results of this simulation (e)&#13;
are shown in the second line of Table 22. Now the impact of adopting a uniform transfer is&#13;
more substantial. All three poverty measures decline, especially the poverty gap, which is&#13;
reduced by 12%.       This simulation demonstrates that adopting a uniform transfer can&#13;
substantially reduce poverty if there is no inclusionary targeting error.&#13;
       We now turn to the case of a uniform threshold. For the uniform threshold we use the&#13;
poverty line, which implies that everyone who is poor is eligible. Since the poverty line is higher&#13;
on average than the local dibao thresholds, the number of eligible will be larger than the&#13;
number of dibao eligible (incomes &lt; dibao thresholds). Consequently, if we use a target budget&#13;
based on dibao targeting, it will be insufficient to cover all eligible individuals. We must&#13;
therefore make some assumption about how recipients are selected from among the poor.&#13;
       We use two alternative assumptions. The first is that recipients are selected based on&#13;
distance from the poverty line, starting with the poorest (simulation f). The second is that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 31&#13;
&amp;#12;recipients are selected randomly from among the poor (simulation g). Both selection methods&#13;
yield zero inclusionary and zero exclusionary targeting error; however, selection in simulation&#13;
(g) ignores depth of poverty.   In these simulations the target budget is that in the â&#128;&#156;perfect&#13;
dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline, and recipients receive the local transfers. Comparing the poverty&#13;
outcomes to the â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157; baseline tells us whether, in a world of perfect&#13;
targeting, replacing local thresholds with a uniform threshold would reduce poverty.&#13;
       As reported in Table 22, simulation (f) reduces the poverty gap and squared poverty gap&#13;
compared to the baseline, but the poverty headcount increases. Simulation (g) reduces the&#13;
poverty headcount and poverty gap, but the squared poverty gap increases. This difference in&#13;
outcomes between simulations (f) and (g) is not surprising, because the dibao recipients in (f)&#13;
are on average in deeper poverty than the recipients in (g). We conclude that adopting a&#13;
uniform national eligibility threshold has the potential to reduce poverty substantially&#13;
compared to retaining local dibao thresholds, although the nature of the poverty impact will&#13;
depend on how recipients are selected among the poor.&#13;
       Finally, what would be the impact of adopting both a uniform dibao transfer amount&#13;
and a uniform threshold? Simulations (h) and (i) explore this policy option. In both (h) and (i)&#13;
the uniform transfer is set equal to the average transfer in the â&#128;&#156;perfect dibao targetingâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
baseline. Simulation (h) selects recipients based on depth of poverty, while simulation (i)&#13;
selects recipients randomly among the poor.&#13;
       Both these simulations yield substantial reductions in some, but not all, of the poverty&#13;
measures. Simulation (h) yields the largest reductions in the poverty gap and squared gap. In&#13;
these regards it is superior to only adopting a uniform transfer (e). The poverty headcount is&#13;
higher, however, than in both the baseline and simulation (e). If dibao recipients are selected&#13;
randomly among the poor (simulation i), then adopting both a uniform transfer and threshold&#13;
can substantially reduce the poverty headcount and poverty gap compared to the baseline, and&#13;
also compared to adopting a uniform transfer (e). The squared poverty gap, however, is higher.&#13;
       Overall, the simulations in Table 22 indicate that uniform transfer and/or uniform&#13;
threshold policies have the potential to increase the dibao programâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness, but&#13;
predicated on the assumption of perfect targeting in both the baseline and policy simulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             32&#13;
&amp;#12;We know that in fact the dibao program has substantial inclusionary targeting error, and&#13;
simulation (d) demonstrates that in the presence of inclusionary targeting error at observed&#13;
levels, the impact of a uniform transfer policy will be minimal. It is difficult to construct a&#13;
simulation of the uniform threshold in the presence of targeting error. We speculate, however,&#13;
that a uniform threshold would be more effective than a uniform transfer, because it would&#13;
increase the share of dibao recipients from counties with lower local thresholds, which tend to&#13;
have more poor. This policy reform would require fiscal measures that increase dibao funding&#13;
resources in poorer counties.&#13;
&#13;
 XI.   Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program, which was adopted nationwide starting in 2007, is now one of the&#13;
largest targeted transfer schemes in the world. The programâ&#128;&#153;s implementation and expansion&#13;
in recent years have coincided with reductions in rural poverty in China. This raises the&#13;
question of whether, or to what extent, the program has contributed to poverty reduction.&#13;
       Using household survey data matched with administrative data for 2007-2009, we have&#13;
examined the relationship between Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural dibao program and rural poverty and&#13;
conducted targeting analysis using conventional and propensity score approaches. We find&#13;
that during these years the rural dibao program provided sufficient income to poor&#13;
beneficiaries, but the poverty impact of the program overall was small. Although total dibao&#13;
expenditures are fairly large relative to the poverty gap, the program did not substantially&#13;
reduce the poverty gap.&#13;
       Conventional targeting analysis reveals large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting&#13;
errors. Propensity score analysis of targeting reduces the targeting errors, which suggests that&#13;
the program has been implemented in reference to an unobserved latent income variable&#13;
rather than income as measured by the NBS in the CHIP survey. Nevertheless, even using&#13;
propensity score-based targeting analysis, the targeting errors remain quite large.&#13;
       Our analysis indicates that during these years a central reason for the programâ&#128;&#153;s modest&#13;
poverty impact and high exclusionary targeting error was that the proportion of the population&#13;
covered by the program was small. Since 2009 the rural dibao program has expanded rapidly in&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             33&#13;
&amp;#12;terms of its overall the budget. Most of the budget increase, however, has been used to&#13;
increase transfer amounts. The number of recipients has changed fairly little.&#13;
       Using simulations, we explore whether modifications in the dibao program would&#13;
increase its impact on poverty. We first explore the impact of increasing the dibao budget (a)&#13;
by increasing transfer amounts and (b) by expanding coverage. Our results indicate that&#13;
expanding coverage is more effective than increasing transfer levels, although the extent to&#13;
which it is more effective depends on targeting among the added dibao beneficiaries.&#13;
       We also use simulations to explore whether adopting a uniform transfer and uniform&#13;
threshold will improve the programâ&#128;&#153;s poverty impact. Both these policies have the potential to&#13;
substantially reduce poverty, but the extent to which that potential is realized depends critically&#13;
on targeting. For example, a uniform transfer to the recipients observed in the 2009 data yields&#13;
minimal improvement in poverty by any measure.&#13;
       Overall, the simulations yield several broad lessons. First, expanding the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
coverage has more potential to reduce poverty than increasing transfer amounts, even with&#13;
imperfect targeting and local variation in thresholds and transfer amounts. We recommend&#13;
that future increases in the dibao budget should mainly be used to expand coverage rather&#13;
than increase transfer amounts. Second, in theory adopting uniform dibao transfers and&#13;
thresholds can yield gains in poverty reduction, but in practice the gains may be limited due to&#13;
imperfect targeting, especially by extent of inclusionary error. Our simulations demonstrate&#13;
that a uniform transfer policy will have minimal poverty impact if the targeting error is similar&#13;
to that in 2009. We speculate that a uniform threshold policy is more likely to have an impact&#13;
in the presence of targeting error, as it would tend to reallocate the regional distribution of&#13;
dibao transfers from richer to poorer counties.&#13;
       Our simulation analyses explore the consequences of expanding the dibao program or&#13;
from modifying the levels of transfers and eligibility thresholds, holding targeting constant. We&#13;
fix our targeting assumptions and then alter parameters of the program.             It is possible,&#13;
however, that targeting is endogenous and influenced by the parameters of the program. For&#13;
example, small transfers may promote self-selection by poorer households into the program,&#13;
thus improving targeting as evidenced from the Brazilian Bolsa Familia program (Bastagli, 2008)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                34&#13;
&amp;#12;which relies of self-reported income for targeting small cash transfers. This sort of interaction&#13;
between program parameters and targeting strengthens the case for expanding coverage&#13;
versus increasing transfer amounts. The program implementation may affect local government&#13;
behavior and so the size of the dibao budget. For example if there is a large poverty impact&#13;
tradeoff between higher transfers or higher coverage depending on targeting accuracy,&#13;
increasing transfer amounts under high rates of inclusionary errors undermines program&#13;
legitimacy, especially among the tax-paying constituency, which may in turn impact the local&#13;
budget.     In comparison, reduced exclusionary error by virtue of program expansion can&#13;
potentially build further fiscal support.&#13;
       Our findings are influenced by limitations of our data. One limitation is the lack of&#13;
household-level information on dibao transfers. In our analyses we have used village- (and&#13;
county-) level data on dibao transfers to construct estimates of the household-level transfers&#13;
on the assumption that within villages (or counties) the transfers are uniform and equal to the&#13;
local average. If in fact dibao transfers vary within localities such that poorer households&#13;
receive larger transfers than richer households, then the programâ&#128;&#153;s poverty impact may be&#13;
larger than that implied by our estimates.&#13;
       Another data limitation is potential bias in the dibao participation rates.          Dibao&#13;
participation in the CHIP sample is considerably lower than in the official statistics published by&#13;
the MOCA and NBS. Of course, this could be because the official statistics are biased. If,&#13;
however, the discrepancy is due to understatement in the CHIP survey of dibao participation&#13;
rates, then our findings will understate the programâ&#128;&#153;s poverty impact.&#13;

Note: The Ministry of Civil Affairs only started publishing data on transfers and thresholds for the rural dibao program after 2007, so&#13;
data for transfers and thresholds for earlier years are missing or incomplete. Dibao transfers are the sum of dibao transfers from all&#13;
levels of government. The average transfer is calculated as total rural dibao transfers divided by the number of recipients.&#13;

Notes: Inequality in the CHIP samples is estimated over individuals in the nine provinces that&#13;
are covered in all years of the CHIP survey (see text). Here and elsewhere, unless noted&#13;
otherwise, all calculations using the CHIP data are weighted using two-level (province x region)&#13;
population weights. Inequality from official publications is based on nationwide data covering&#13;
all provinces.&#13;
&#13;
Sources: Official Gini coefficients are from the National Bureau of Statistics Rural&#13;
Socioeconomic Survey Department (2010). Official income ratios of the top 20% to bottom&#13;
20% are calculated using average rural incomes of the top and bottom 20% reported by the NBS&#13;
(various years). Estimates of inequality in the CHIP samples are calculated using the CHIP&#13;

Notes: All poverty lines are in current prices. The official poverty line is the new official poverty&#13;
line of 2300 yuan announced in 2011. We adjust this back to 2007, 2008 and 2009 using the&#13;
rural consumer price index published by the NBS (various years). The $1.25 and $2&#13;
international poverty lines are converted to yuan using the 2005 PPP exchange rate of 4.09&#13;
(LCU per international dollar, World Development Indicators 2013,&#13;
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators), and then adjusted&#13;
forward to 2007, 2008 and 2009 using the rural consumer price index.&#13;

Notes: Calculated over individuals. The national CHIP participation rates are calculated using&#13;
weights; the provincial CHIP rates are unweighted. CHIP dibao participation rates are self-&#13;
reported by households; members of households that report participation in either the dibao or&#13;
wubao program are counted as dibao participants. The NBS publishes statistics on the national&#13;
number of rural dibao participants; we divide these by the rural population to obtain the official&#13;
national participation rates. MOCA issues the provincial numbers of rural dibao participants by&#13;
month. We use the December numbers divided by NBS provincial rural population statistics to&#13;
calculate the official provincial and 9-province participation rates. As a check, we calculated the&#13;
national participation rates using the MOCA December numbers, which gives participation rates&#13;
of 5.94 in 2008 and 6.68 in 2009; these are consistent with the participation rates based on the&#13;
NBS annual participation numbers shown in the table.&#13;

Notes: Weighted. The poverty gap is calculated using the official poverty line (Table 4). Ex&#13;
ante incomes are calculated by subtracting county average dibao expenditures from incomes&#13;
reported in the CHIP data. MOCA total dibao expenditures are the official national totals (Table&#13;
1). CHIP total dibao expenditures are calculated as the (weighted) sum over all individuals&#13;
receiving dibao in the CHIP sample of the county average transfer in the location of residence.&#13;
Note that for dibao recipients who live in counties for which MOCA county average transfer&#13;
data are not available, we use the village average transfers from CHIP (which are available only&#13;
in 2008 and 2009).&#13;

individuals with income below the poverty line who were not dibao recipients. Poverty&#13;
classifications are carried out using ex ante incomes.&#13;

Note to Tables 15, 16 and 17: Unweighted. We also calculated the descriptive statistics using&#13;
household size weights, with little difference in results, so we do not report them. 2007 values&#13;
are calculated over 7855 non-dibao and 145 dibao households; 2008 and 2009 values are&#13;

&amp;#12;calculated over 7818 and 176, and 7715 and 240, non-dibao and dibao households,&#13;

values.&#13;

Notes: Estimated over households, without weights. Estimation was also done using the&#13;
household-size as weights; the coefficients were very similar and equality could not be rejected&#13;
using a Hausman test. The table reports marginal effects, evaluated at the mean of the data.&#13;
Standard errors are in parentheses. The regressions also included controls for province fixed&#13;
effects (not reported). Anhui, Henan, Chongqing and Guangdong had significant, positive&#13;
coefficients with Hebei as reference province. The regressions were estimated including some&#13;
additional explanatory variables such as years of schooling, but since the coefficients were&#13;
uniformly not significant, these variables were dropped. Statistically significant coefficients are&#13;
shown in red. *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1.&#13;

Notes: Percentages of CHIP sample individuals in each year, calculated using weights. Eligibility&#13;
is determined using the propensity score method. Propensity scores are calculated from the&#13;
probit estimates in Table 18 (specification 2). The propensity score threshold for each year is&#13;
created by counting off individuals ranked from highest to lowest propensity score, starting&#13;
from the highest propensity score, until reaching the number of dibao individuals in the survey&#13;
that year. By construction, in the propensity score approach the number of eligible individuals&#13;
is exactly equal to the number of recipient individuals. Consequently, column 2 (all ineligible) is&#13;
identical to the last column (total not receiving dibao), and column 3 (all eligible) is identical to&#13;
column 6 (eligible receiving dibao). In reality, the number of eligible individuals exceeds the&#13;
number of recipients.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Note: Weighted. Calculated from the numbers in Table 19. Inclusion error is the percent of&#13;
dibao recipients who are not eligible according to the propensity score method; exclusion error&#13;
equals the percent of eligible individuals (according to the propensity score method) who did&#13;
not receive dibao transfers. By construction, in the propensity score approach inclusion and&#13;
exclusion errors are the same because the number of eligible individuals is exactly equal to the&#13;
number of recipient individuals. In reality, the number of eligible individuals exceeds the&#13;
number of recipients, so in that in the conventional targeting analysis the exclusion errors are&#13;
larger than the inclusion errors (Table 12).&#13;

Notes: The baseline case is calculated using rural population weights and observed dibao participation in the 2009 CHIP data. Dibao&#13;
transfer amounts are assumed to equal the local average in the village of residence (where village data are missing, we use the&#13;
county average from MOCA). Poverty is calculated using the official poverty line. Simulations (a) â&#128;&#147; (d) assume that dibao transfers&#13;
continue to go to all recipients in the baseline case. The expanded budget used in these simulations is 2.54 times the base budget,&#13;
which is the amount of funding required by simulation (a) in which transfers continue to go to original recipients as well as to any&#13;
other individuals who were not original recipients but who are eligible, i.e., whose incomes are below their local dibao thresholds.&#13;
Simulation (b) assumes that the program is expanded by adding additional recipients who are selected randomly from among all&#13;
non-recipients until the budget is exhausted. Simulations (c) and (d) do not add any new dibao recipients, but explore changing the&#13;
amount of the dibao transfers. Simulation (c) increases the transfer received by each dibao recipient in the baseline by 2.54 times.&#13;
Simulation (d) replaces the transfer received by each dibao recipient in the baseline case with a uniform transfer equal to the&#13;
average baseline transfer of 666 Yuan.&#13;

Notes: The baseline in this table is a simulation in which there is perfect targeting based on the dibao thresholds: all individuals&#13;
with income below their local dibao thresholds receive the local dibao transfers, and no individuals with income above their local&#13;
dibao thresholds receive dibao transfers. Simulation (e) is the same as the baseline except local transfer amounts are replaced with&#13;
a uniform transfer equal to the average transfer in the baseline (887 Yuan). Simulation (f) assumes a uniform threshold equal to the&#13;
official poverty line, with perfect targeting based on depth of poverty. Recipients are selected starting with the poorest (those&#13;
furthest below the official poverty line) and given the local transfer until the baseline budget is used up. Simulation (g) also assumes&#13;
a uniform threshold equal to the official poverty line, but here dibao recipients are randomly selected from among the poor and&#13;
given the local transfer until the baseline budget is used up. Simulation (h) is the same as simulation (f) but transfers are now&#13;
uniform and equal to the average transfer in the baseline. Simulation (i) is the same as simulation (g) but transfers are now uniform&#13;
and equal to the average transfer in the baseline. In all cases poverty levels are calculated using the official poverty line.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This paper examines Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rural minimum living standard guarantee (dibao) program, one&#13;
of the largest targeted transfer schemes in the world. Using household survey data matched&#13;
with published administrative data, we provide background on the patterns of inequality and&#13;
poverty in rural China, describe the dibao program, estimate the programâ&#128;&#153;s impact on poverty,&#13;
and carry out targeting analysis. We find that the program provides sufficient income to poor&#13;
beneficiaries but does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty, in part because&#13;
the number of beneficiaries is small relative to the number of poor. Conventional targeting&#13;
analysis reveals rather large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting errors; propensity score&#13;
targeting analysis yields smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of possible reforms&#13;
to the dibao program indicate that expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty&#13;
reduction than increasing transfer amounts. In addition, replacing locally diverse dibao lines&#13;
with a nationally uniform dibao threshold could in theory reduce poverty. The potential gains&#13;
in poverty reduction, however, depend on the effectiveness of targeting.&#13;

            This paper examines China's rural
            minimum living standard guarantee (dibao) program, one of
            the largest targeted transfer schemes in the world. Using
            household survey data matched with published administrative
            data, the authors provide background on the patterns of
            inequality and poverty in rural China, describe the dibao
            program, estimate the program's impact on poverty, and
            carry out targeting analysis. The authors find that the
            program provides sufficient income to poor beneficiaries but
            does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty,
            in part because the number of beneficiaries is small
            relative to the number of poor. Conventional targeting

            targeting errors; propensity score targeting analysis yields
            smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of
            possible reforms to the dibao program indicate that
            expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty
