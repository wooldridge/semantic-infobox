The &#13;
Bank &#13;
approved &#13;
a &#13;
Structural &#13;
Adjustment &#13;
Loan &#13;
(SAL) &#13;
of &#13;
US$400 &#13;
million &#13;
for &#13;
Argentina &#13;
on &#13;
August &#13;
28,200l &#13;
(Report &#13;
No. &#13;
7479~AR &#13;
of &#13;
August &#13;
6,200l). &#13;
The &#13;
Loan &#13;
Agreement &#13;
was &#13;
declared &#13;
effective &#13;
on &#13;
September &#13;
17,2001, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
US$200 &#13;
million &#13;
(including &#13;
the &#13;
one &#13;
percent &#13;
up-front &#13;
fee) &#13;
was &#13;
disbursed &#13;
on &#13;
September &#13;
19,200l. &#13;
The &#13;
SAL &#13;
supported &#13;
the &#13;
Government&#146;s &#13;
program &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
public &#13;
administration, &#13;
in &#13;
general, &#13;
and &#13;
specifically &#13;
administration &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
programs &#13;
under &#13;
its &#13;
own &#13;
responsibility &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
administration &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
tax &#13;
system &#13;
that &#13;
finances &#13;
social &#13;
expenditures &#13;
at &#13;
all &#13;
levels &#13;
of &#13;
government. &#13;
It &#13;
also &#13;
supported &#13;
improvements &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
structure &#13;
and &#13;
regulatory &#13;
environment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
system. &#13;
Finally, &#13;
it &#13;
supported &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
efforts &#13;
to &#13;
stabilize &#13;
provincial &#13;
transfers &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
finances, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
coordinate &#13;
activities &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
to &#13;
lead &#13;
to &#13;
improved &#13;
transparency, &#13;
budgeting &#13;
and &#13;
planning &#13;
at &#13;
that &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
government. &#13;
2 &#13;
The &#13;
SAL &#13;
was &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
an &#13;
international &#13;
package &#13;
of &#13;
financial &#13;
support &#13;
totaling &#13;
approximately &#13;
$39.7 &#13;
billion &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
negotiated &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
2000 &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
set &#13;
of &#13;
economic &#13;
reforms &#13;
to &#13;
respond &#13;
to &#13;
two &#13;
years &#13;
of &#13;
negative &#13;
growth &#13;
following &#13;
the &#13;
devaluation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Brazilian &#13;
Real &#13;
in &#13;
early &#13;
1999. &#13;
These &#13;
reforms &#13;
included &#13;
a &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
social &#13;
security &#13;
expenditures &#13;
over &#13;
the &#13;
medium &#13;
term &#13;
via &#13;
improved &#13;
targeting, &#13;
an &#13;
agreement &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
limiting &#13;
the &#13;
growth &#13;
of &#13;
transfers, &#13;
and &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
employment &#13;
creation &#13;
programs. &#13;
The &#13;
intent &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
package &#13;
was &#13;
to &#13;
cover &#13;
most &#13;
of &#13;
Argentina&#146;s &#13;
external &#13;
financing &#13;
needs &#13;
for &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
into &#13;
2002, &#13;
thus &#13;
providing &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
support &#13;
for &#13;
structural &#13;
reforms &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
enacted. &#13;
The &#13;
expectation &#13;
was &#13;
that &#13;
these &#13;
reforms &#13;
would &#13;
restore &#13;
growth &#13;
and &#13;
create &#13;
a &#13;
virtuous &#13;
circle &#13;
of &#13;
increased &#13;
revenues, &#13;
thus &#13;
reducing &#13;
fiscal &#13;
pressures. &#13;
3 &#13;
Disbursement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
(US$200 &#13;
million) &#13;
was &#13;
expected &#13;
for &#13;
late &#13;
2601 &#13;
or &#13;
early &#13;
2002. &#13;
By &#13;
December &#13;
of &#13;
2001, &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
had &#13;
implemented &#13;
most &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
actions &#13;
required &#13;
as &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
for &#13;
disbursement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche. &#13;
However, &#13;
the &#13;
traumatic &#13;
political &#13;
and &#13;
economic &#13;
events &#13;
that &#13;
occurred &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
quarter &#13;
of &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
early &#13;
2002 &#13;
tore &#13;
apart &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policy &#13;
framework &#13;
needed &#13;
to &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
SAL, &#13;
and &#13;
disbursement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche &#13;
became &#13;
moot. &#13;
The &#13;
Government &#13;
nevertheless &#13;
requested &#13;
an &#13;
extension &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
closing &#13;
date &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
loan, &#13;
originally &#13;
June &#13;
30,2002, &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
it &#13;
with &#13;
financing &#13;
options &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
event &#13;
that &#13;
it &#13;
could &#13;
reestablish &#13;
an &#13;
adequate &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policy &#13;
framework. &#13;
In &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
fact &#13;
that &#13;
most &#13;
specific &#13;
second &#13;
tranche &#13;
conditions &#13;
had &#13;
already &#13;
been &#13;
complied &#13;
with, &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
extended &#13;
the &#13;
closing &#13;
date &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
loan &#13;
until &#13;
June &#13;
30,2003. &#13;

The &#13;
following &#13;
sections &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
memorandum &#13;
summarize &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policies &#13;
that &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
put &#13;
in &#13;
place &#13;
since &#13;
early &#13;
2002, &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
progress &#13;
in &#13;
implementing &#13;
the &#13;
reform &#13;
program &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
SAL, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
actions &#13;
taken &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
of &#13;
Argentina &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
for &#13;
release &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche. &#13;

Overall, &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
policies &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
has &#13;
shown &#13;
the &#13;
resolve &#13;
and &#13;
commitment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
authorities &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
objectives &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
program, &#13;
despite &#13;
the &#13;
dramatic &#13;
crises &#13;
the &#13;
country &#13;
has &#13;
undergone. &#13;
The &#13;
Government &#13;
has &#13;
complied &#13;
with &#13;
27 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
30 &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
required &#13;
for &#13;
release &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche. &#13;
Three &#13;
conditions &#13;
were &#13;
not &#13;
met, &#13;
however, &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
economic &#13;
and &#13;
political &#13;
developments &#13;
of &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
2002. &#13;
These &#13;
are &#13;
(i) &#13;
reduction &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
provincial &#13;
fiscal &#13;
deficit &#13;
for &#13;
2001, &#13;
which &#13;
did &#13;
not &#13;
occur &#13;
until &#13;
2002; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
implementing &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
calculation &#13;
of &#13;
non-contributory &#13;
pensions, &#13;
which &#13;
is &#13;
being &#13;
challenged &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
courts; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
implementing &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;
family &#13;
allowances, &#13;
which &#13;
was &#13;
delayed &#13;
by &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
social &#13;
assistance &#13;
policy, &#13;
but &#13;
is &#13;
scheduled &#13;
to &#13;
start &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
near &#13;
future. &#13;
6 &#13;
Based &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
strong &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program, &#13;
and &#13;
in &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
continuing &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
stabilization &#13;
and &#13;
markedly &#13;
improved &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
(see &#13;
below), &#13;
the &#13;
progress &#13;
towards &#13;
implementing &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
payments &#13;
system &#13;
for &#13;
family &#13;
allowances, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
obstacles &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
pension &#13;
reform &#13;
measures, &#13;
waivers &#13;
are &#13;
proposed &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
above &#13;
three &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions. &#13;
Upon &#13;
Board &#13;
approval &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
proposal, &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
would &#13;
advise &#13;
the &#13;
Borrower &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
loan &#13;
is &#13;
available &#13;
for &#13;
withdrawal. &#13;

. &#13;
After &#13;
plunging &#13;
into &#13;
a &#13;
deep &#13;
crisis &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
few &#13;
months &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine &#13;
economy &#13;
reached &#13;
a &#13;
certain &#13;
degree &#13;
of &#13;
stability &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
last &#13;
year. &#13;
This &#13;
stability &#13;
was &#13;
characterized &#13;
by: &#13;
(i) &#13;
an &#13;
interruption &#13;
in &#13;
output &#13;
decline &#13;
and &#13;
gradual &#13;
recovery &#13;
toward &#13;
the &#13;
latter &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
year; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
a &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate, &#13;
albeit &#13;
at &#13;
a &#13;
much &#13;
depreciated &#13;
level; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
a &#13;
broad &#13;
balance &#13;
between &#13;
revenues &#13;
and &#13;
non-interest &#13;
expenditures, &#13;
although &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
expense &#13;
of &#13;
non &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
debt &#13;
obligations &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
compression &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
real &#13;
value &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
wages &#13;
and &#13;
pension &#13;
benefits. &#13;
This &#13;
stabilization &#13;
engendered &#13;
a &#13;
cautious &#13;
optimism &#13;
about &#13;
the &#13;
short &#13;
run &#13;
prospects &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
country &#13;
and &#13;
set &#13;
the &#13;
stage &#13;
for &#13;
Argentina &#13;
to &#13;
reach &#13;
a &#13;
short-term &#13;
agreement &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
IMF &#13;

the &#13;
period &#13;

Central &#13;
to &#13;
achieving &#13;
the &#13;
economic &#13;
stabilization &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2002 &#13;
was &#13;
the &#13;
improvement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
fiscal &#13;
position &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
cash &#13;
basis. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
Federal &#13;
government &#13;
level, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
a &#13;
shift &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
balanced &#13;
primary &#13;
position &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
primary &#13;
surplus &#13;
of &#13;
0.7 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
The &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal &#13;
position &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
Federal &#13;
level &#13;
reflected &#13;
the &#13;
revision &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
sharing &#13;
agreements &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
(see &#13;
below), &#13;
the &#13;
broadening &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
tax &#13;
base, &#13;
and &#13;
tight &#13;
controls &#13;
of &#13;
expenditures. &#13;
Broadening &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
tax &#13;
base &#13;
resulted &#13;
primarily &#13;
from &#13;
higher &#13;
taxes &#13;
on &#13;
exports, &#13;
which &#13;
by &#13;
end-December &#13;
2002 &#13;
accounted &#13;
for &#13;
12 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
total &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
inflation &#13;
on &#13;
revenues &#13;
in &#13;
general, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
transactions &#13;
tax. &#13;
On &#13;
the &#13;
expenditure &#13;
side, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
compression &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
wages &#13;
and &#13;
pensions &#13;
through &#13;
inflation, &#13;
leading &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
around &#13;
one-quarter &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
real &#13;
value. &#13;
Cash &#13;
interest &#13;
payments &#13;
also &#13;
fell &#13;
sharply &#13;
following &#13;
the &#13;
default &#13;
on &#13;
most &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
debt &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
2001. &#13;
9 &#13;
Provincial &#13;
finances &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
level, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
a &#13;
93 &#13;
percent &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
primary &#13;
deficit, &#13;
from &#13;
1.5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
to &#13;
0.1 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
The &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
primary &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
was &#13;
mainly &#13;
attributable &#13;
to &#13;
three &#13;
factors, &#13;
each &#13;
of &#13;
about &#13;
equal &#13;
importance &#13;
- &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
provincial &#13;
own &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues &#13;
(reflecting &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
inflation), &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
royalties &#13;
from &#13;
oil &#13;
and &#13;
hydroelectric &#13;
production &#13;
(reflecting &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
devaluation), &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
capital &#13;
expenditures. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
benefited &#13;
from &#13;

most &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
debts &#13;
with &#13;
commercial &#13;
banks &#13;
(see &#13;
para. &#13;
22). &#13;
Taking &#13;
interest &#13;
expenses &#13;
into &#13;
account, &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
overall &#13;
provincial &#13;
deficit &#13;
declined &#13;
from &#13;
2.4 &#13;
to &#13;
0.6 &#13;

of &#13;
GDP. &#13;

Monetary &#13;

rate &#13;
stability. &#13;
The &#13;
government&#146;s &#13;
balanced &#13;
cash &#13;
fiscal &#13;
position &#13;
meant &#13;
that &#13;
monetary &#13;
policy &#13;
could &#13;
focus &#13;
on &#13;
stabilizing &#13;
the &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate. &#13;
Exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
stability &#13;
was &#13;
achieved &#13;
by &#13;
mid-year &#13;
due, &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
large &#13;
extent, &#13;
to &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
regulations &#13;
requiring &#13;
exporters &#13;
to &#13;
surrender &#13;
export &#13;
earnings &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
bank. &#13;
Foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
regulations &#13;
provided &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine &#13;
authorities &#13;
with &#13;
ample &#13;
supply &#13;
of &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency, &#13;
which, &#13;
in &#13;
combination &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
non-servicing &#13;
of &#13;
debt &#13;
on &#13;
account &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
default &#13;
situation, &#13;
allowed &#13;
international &#13;
reserves &#13;
to &#13;
stabilize &#13;
and &#13;
slowly &#13;
recover. &#13;
The &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
international &#13;
reserves, &#13;
combined &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
gradual &#13;
recovery &#13;
of &#13;
deposits &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
banking &#13;
system, &#13;
led &#13;
in &#13;
turn &#13;
to &#13;
rapid &#13;
monetary &#13;
expansion, &#13;
especially &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
quarter &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
despite &#13;
sterilization &#13;
efforts &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
bank. &#13;
Also, &#13;
large &#13;
trade &#13;
surpluses &#13;
and &#13;
weak &#13;
demand &#13;
for &#13;
dollars &#13;
meant &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
peso &#13;
gradually &#13;
gained &#13;
strength &#13;
against &#13;
the &#13;
dollar. &#13;
The &#13;
currency &#13;
appreciation &#13;
provided &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
opportunity &#13;
to &#13;
ease &#13;
some &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
foreign &#13;
exchange &#13;
regulations,&#146; &#13;
signaling &#13;
an &#13;
important &#13;
first &#13;
step &#13;
toward &#13;
normalizing &#13;
the &#13;
operations &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
foreign &#13;
exchange &#13;
market. &#13;
To &#13;
ensure &#13;
monetary &#13;
and &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
stability &#13;
in &#13;
2003, &#13;
however, &#13;
more &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
done &#13;
by &#13;
generating &#13;
larger &#13;
fiscal &#13;
surpluses &#13;
and &#13;
by &#13;
allowing &#13;
trade &#13;
surpluses &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
used &#13;
for &#13;
resuming &#13;
interest &#13;
payments &#13;
on &#13;
public &#13;
debt &#13;
currently &#13;
in &#13;
default. &#13;

IMF &#13;
program. &#13;
The &#13;
IMF&#146;s &#13;
short-term &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
aims &#13;
at &#13;
bridging &#13;
the &#13;
period &#13;
between &#13;
the &#13;
Presidential &#13;
election &#13;
on &#13;
April &#13;
27 &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
few &#13;
months &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
next &#13;
administration &#13;
by &#13;
ensuring &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
monetary &#13;
stability &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
transition. &#13;
This &#13;
would &#13;
set &#13;
the &#13;
stage &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
more &#13;
comprehensive &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
fundamental &#13;
reforms, &#13;
tackling &#13;
the &#13;
structural &#13;
problems &#13;
confronting &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
The &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
includes &#13;
actions &#13;
to: &#13;
(i) &#13;
raise &#13;
tax &#13;
revenue &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
fiscal &#13;
stability &#13;
at &#13;
all &#13;
levels &#13;
of &#13;
government; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
normalize &#13;
relations &#13;
with &#13;
foreign &#13;
investors, &#13;
including &#13;
initial &#13;
contacts &#13;
with &#13;
foreign &#13;
bondholders, &#13;
and &#13;
an &#13;
assessment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
and &#13;
regulatory &#13;
framework &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
renegotiation &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
services &#13;
and &#13;
infrastructure &#13;
concessions &#13;
is &#13;
being &#13;
conducted; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
renew &#13;
last &#13;
year&#146;s &#13;
federal-provincial &#13;
agreement, &#13;
ensuring &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
latter &#13;
meet &#13;
agreed &#13;
fiscal &#13;
targets. &#13;
In &#13;
parallel, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
governments &#13;
have &#13;
agreed &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
undertaking &#13;
reforms &#13;
aimed &#13;
at &#13;
(i) &#13;
ensuring &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
are &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
delivering &#13;
key &#13;
social &#13;
services &#13;
(health, &#13;
education &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
assistance), &#13;
especially &#13;
those &#13;
targeted &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
poor; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
strengthening &#13;
the &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
financial &#13;
sustainability &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
public &#13;
pension &#13;
system; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
improving &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
and &#13;
expenditure &#13;
management. &#13;
To &#13;
date, &#13;
the &#13;
IMF &#13;
program &#13;
remains &#13;
on &#13;
track. &#13;
Importers &#13;
of &#13;
capital &#13;
goods &#13;
and &#13;
spare &#13;
parts &#13;
were &#13;
allowed &#13;
to &#13;
pay &#13;
100 &#13;
percent &#13;
cash &#13;
in &#13;
advance, &#13;
reducing &#13;
barriers &#13;
to &#13;
new &#13;
investments. &#13;
Similarly, &#13;
exporters &#13;
of &#13;
capital &#13;
goods &#13;
were &#13;
no &#13;
longer &#13;
subject &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
export &#13;
tax. &#13;
More &#13;
importantly, &#13;
the &#13;
Central &#13;
Bank &#13;
lifted &#13;
restrictions &#13;
on &#13;
external &#13;
debt &#13;
payments &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
private &#13;
sector, &#13;
with &#13;
no &#13;
restrictions &#13;
on &#13;
interest &#13;
payments &#13;
and &#13;
fewer &#13;
restrictions &#13;
on &#13;
principal &#13;
repayments. &#13;
Finally, &#13;
the &#13;
limit &#13;
on &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
in &#13;
bank &#13;
portfolios &#13;
were &#13;
increased, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
monthly &#13;
ceiling &#13;
on &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
purchases &#13;
by &#13;
individuals &#13;
and &#13;
corporations &#13;
raised &#13;
from &#13;
US$ &#13;
100,000 &#13;
to &#13;
US$ &#13;
150,000. &#13;

Prospects. &#13;
Argentina&#146;s &#13;
prospects &#13;
for &#13;
2003 &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
continuation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
recovery &#13;
in &#13;
output &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
maintenance &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
monetary &#13;
stability &#13;
reached &#13;
over &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
last &#13;
year. &#13;
The &#13;
prospects &#13;
for &#13;
output &#13;
recovery &#13;
reflects &#13;
the &#13;
depth &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
output &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
4 &#13;
years &#13;
(20 &#13;
percent) &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
opportunities &#13;
provided &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
sharp &#13;
devaluation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
currency. &#13;
Export &#13;
and &#13;
import &#13;
substituting &#13;
activities &#13;
could &#13;
continue &#13;
leading &#13;
the &#13;
recovery, &#13;
with &#13;
real &#13;
GDP &#13;
growth &#13;
projected &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
3.5 &#13;
to &#13;
4 &#13;
percent &#13;
range &#13;
(see &#13;
annex &#13;
table &#13;
1). &#13;
To &#13;
sustain &#13;
the &#13;
recovery, &#13;
vigorous &#13;
fiscal &#13;
management &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
targeting &#13;
consolidated &#13;
primary &#13;
fiscal &#13;
surpluses, &#13;
increasing &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
slight &#13;
surplus &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
2.5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
surplus &#13;
by &#13;
end-2003. &#13;
Also, &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
to &#13;
improve, &#13;
so &#13;
that &#13;
tax &#13;
receipts &#13;
keep &#13;
rising &#13;
with &#13;
output. &#13;
Strong &#13;
fiscal &#13;
management &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
stable &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
should &#13;
restrain &#13;
inflation, &#13;
curtailing &#13;
demands &#13;
for &#13;
adjustments &#13;
in &#13;
expenditures &#13;
(especially &#13;
wages, &#13;
salaries &#13;
and &#13;
pension &#13;
benefits). &#13;
13 &#13;
In &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
above, &#13;
and &#13;
taking &#13;
into &#13;
consideration &#13;
the &#13;
results &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
review &#13;
of &#13;
Argentina&#146;s &#13;
arrangement &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
IMF &#13;
just &#13;
completed &#13;
on &#13;
March &#13;
19,2003, &#13;
on &#13;
balance &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policies &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
appear &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
adequate, &#13;
even &#13;
while &#13;
there &#13;
remain &#13;
substantial &#13;
uncertainties &#13;
and &#13;
challenges, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
major &#13;
risks. &#13;

THE &#13;
ST~U~TU~LADJUSTME~TPROG~M &#13;
14 &#13;
. &#13;
The &#13;
actions &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
were &#13;
intended &#13;
to: &#13;
(a) &#13;
improve &#13;
fiscal &#13;
stability &#13;
across &#13;
levels &#13;
of &#13;
government; &#13;
(b) &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency, &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
quality &#13;
of &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
services; &#13;
(c) &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
financial &#13;
sustainability &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
public &#13;
pension &#13;
system; &#13;
(d) &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
administration &#13;
through &#13;
the &#13;
introduction &#13;
of &#13;
new &#13;
methods &#13;
and &#13;
procedures; &#13;
(e) &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
administration; &#13;
and &#13;
(f) &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
federal &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
social &#13;
protection &#13;
programs &#13;
in &#13;
reaching &#13;
the &#13;
poor. &#13;
15 &#13;
As &#13;
previously &#13;
mentioned, &#13;
overall &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
program &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
strong, &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
having &#13;
attained &#13;
27 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
30 &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
for &#13;
release &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche. &#13;
Of &#13;
the &#13;
three &#13;
conditions &#13;
that &#13;
were &#13;
not &#13;
met, &#13;
the &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
provincial &#13;
fiscal &#13;
deficit &#13;
target &#13;
was &#13;
achieved &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
one &#13;
year &#13;
delay, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
direct &#13;
payment &#13;
system &#13;
for &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
is &#13;
about &#13;
to &#13;
begin &#13;
in &#13;
May &#13;
2003. &#13;
The &#13;
only &#13;
condition &#13;
for &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
objectives &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program &#13;
have &#13;
not, &#13;
or &#13;
will &#13;
not &#13;
soon &#13;
be &#13;
achieved, &#13;
is &#13;
that &#13;
of &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
benefit &#13;
structure &#13;
of &#13;
non-contributory &#13;
pensions, &#13;
for &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
enacted &#13;
the &#13;
specified &#13;
changes &#13;
agreed, &#13;
but &#13;
implementation &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
blocked &#13;
by &#13;
judicial &#13;
challenges &#13;
beyond &#13;
the &#13;
control &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
that &#13;
are &#13;
awaiting &#13;
a &#13;
decision &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Supreme &#13;
Court &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
constitutionality &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
underlying &#13;
law &#13;

Overall, &#13;
the &#13;
program &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
largely &#13;
achieved &#13;
with &#13;
many &#13;
important &#13;
accomplishments, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
federal-provincial &#13;
fiscal &#13;
relations &#13;
(a &#13;
key &#13;
element &#13;
for &#13;
reestablishing &#13;
a &#13;
satisfactory &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
framework), &#13;
enhanced &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
efficiency &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
regulatory &#13;
framework &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
health &#13;

and &#13;
significant &#13;
advances &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
administration &#13;
and &#13;
modernization &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
state. &#13;
Of &#13;
particular &#13;
importance, &#13;
the &#13;
enactment &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
modern &#13;
procurement &#13;
law &#13;
will &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
transparency &#13;
and &#13;
cost &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
state &#13;
procurement, &#13;
which &#13;
will &#13;
yield &#13;
savings &#13;
each &#13;
year &#13;
into &#13;
the &#13;
future. &#13;
Equally &#13;
important &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
improvements &#13;
in &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
that &#13;
will &#13;
reduce &#13;
evasion &#13;
and &#13;
enhance &#13;
revenues, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
improvements &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
administration &#13;
of &#13;
federal &#13;
social &#13;
assistance &#13;
programs &#13;
that &#13;
should &#13;
reduce &#13;

that &#13;
the &#13;

satisfactory &#13;

to &#13;

This &#13;
progress &#13;
is &#13;
as &#13;
evidenced &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
general &#13;
progress &#13;
in &#13;
all &#13;
areas &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;

except &#13;
the &#13;

well &#13;
as &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;

of &#13;
the &#13;
specific &#13;

described &#13;
in &#13;
Schedule &#13;
3 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;

(see &#13;

that &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policy &#13;
framework &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Borrower &#13;
is &#13;
satisfactory. &#13;
The &#13;
existence &#13;
of &#13;
an &#13;
adequate &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
policy &#13;
framework &#13;
is &#13;
evidenced &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal, &#13;
monetary &#13;
and &#13;
real &#13;
aspects &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
economy &#13;
that &#13;
were &#13;
described &#13;
in &#13;
Part &#13;
I &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
memorandum. &#13;
This &#13;
framework &#13;
is &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
an &#13;
active &#13;
IMF &#13;
program &#13;
that &#13;
remains &#13;
on &#13;
track. &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
actions &#13;
described &#13;
in &#13;
Schedule &#13;
3 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Loan &#13;
Agreement &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
taken &#13;
in &#13;
form &#13;
and &#13;
substance &#13;
satisfactory &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Bank. &#13;
That &#13;
these &#13;
actions &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
completed &#13;
is &#13;
evidenced &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
fact &#13;
that &#13;
27 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
30 &#13;
conditions &#13;
listed &#13;
in &#13;
Schedule &#13;
3 &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
fully &#13;
met, &#13;
and &#13;
that &#13;
two &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
remaining &#13;
three &#13;
have &#13;
been, &#13;
or &#13;
are &#13;
being, &#13;
met &#13;
in &#13;
a &#13;
manner &#13;
satisfactory &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;

The &#13;
compliance &#13;
with &#13;
each &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
conditions &#13;
is &#13;

This &#13;
condition &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
met &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
satisfaction &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Bank. &#13;
The &#13;
objective &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
condition &#13;
was, &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
context &#13;
of &#13;
stable &#13;
fiscal &#13;
conditions &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government, &#13;
to &#13;
assure &#13;
a &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
flow &#13;
of &#13;
tax-sharing &#13;
(co-participation) &#13;
revenues &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces, &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
for &#13;
them &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
assured &#13;
levels &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
expenditures. &#13;
This &#13;
condition &#13;
was &#13;
based &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
Federal &#13;
Agreement &#13;
of &#13;
December &#13;
2000, &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
governments &#13;
jointly &#13;
agreed &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
tax &#13;
sharing &#13;
formula &#13;
that &#13;
would &#13;
transfer &#13;
a &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
Argentine &#13;
Pesos &#13;
(Ar$)l.364 &#13;
billion &#13;
per &#13;
month &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces. &#13;
20 &#13;
The &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
transfers &#13;
was &#13;
paid &#13;
in &#13;
full &#13;
throughout &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2001. &#13;
Starting &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
third &#13;
quarter &#13;
of &#13;
2001, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
began &#13;
falling &#13;
behind &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
transfer &#13;
of &#13;
co-participation &#13;
payments &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
declining &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
level. &#13;
By &#13;
the &#13;
end &#13;
of &#13;
2001, &#13;
the &#13;
arrears &#13;
on &#13;
transfers &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
had &#13;
risen &#13;
to &#13;
about &#13;
Ar$800 &#13;
million &#13;
(about &#13;
10% &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
total &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
that &#13;
year), &#13;
in &#13;
spite &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
fact &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
had &#13;
begun &#13;
paying &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
transfers &#13;
in &#13;
LECOP &#13;
(a &#13;
quasi-money &#13;
issued &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
which &#13;
has &#13;
nation-wide &#13;
acceptance &#13;
and &#13;
is &#13;
valid &#13;
for &#13;
paying &#13;
federal &#13;
taxes). &#13;
21 &#13;
In &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
worsening &#13;
economic &#13;
and &#13;
fiscal &#13;
situation, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
signed &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;Second &#13;
Addenda&#148; &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Federal &#13;
Agreement &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
2001, &#13;
which &#13;
stipulated &#13;
a &#13;
13 &#13;
percent &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
monthly &#13;
transfer &#13;
starting &#13;
in &#13;
January &#13;
2002. &#13;
This &#13;
reduction &#13;
was &#13;
equivalent &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
13 &#13;
percent &#13;
across-the-board &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
Federal &#13;
government &#13;
salaries &#13;
and &#13;
pensions &#13;
implemented &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
course &#13;
of &#13;
2001 &#13;
and, &#13;
in &#13;
this &#13;
respect, &#13;
represented &#13;
an &#13;
equitable &#13;
burden &#13;
sharing &#13;
arrangement &#13;
between &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
provinces. &#13;
This &#13;
reduced &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
transfer &#13;
(Ar$l. &#13;
187 &#13;
billion) &#13;
was &#13;
paid &#13;
in &#13;
January &#13;
and &#13;

In &#13;
late &#13;
February &#13;
2002, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
and &#13;
prov &#13;
incial &#13;
governments &#13;
signed &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
basic &#13;
&#145;enues &#13;
agreement &#13;
covering &#13;
inter-governmental &#13;
fiscal &#13;
relations, &#13;
the &#13;
Nation-Provinces &#13;
Accord &#13;
on &#13;
Financial &#13;
Relations &#13;
and &#13;
Basis &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
Revenue &#13;
Sharing &#13;
Regime, &#13;
which &#13;
was &#13;
ratified &#13;
into &#13;
law &#13;
on &#13;
May &#13;
3,2002 &#13;
(Ley &#13;
25.570). &#13;
This &#13;
law &#13;
converted &#13;
the &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
formula &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
fixed &#13;
monthly &#13;
amount &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
proportional &#13;
share &#13;
of &#13;
eligible &#13;
federal &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues. &#13;
2 &#13;
In &#13;
return &#13;
for &#13;
this &#13;
concession, &#13;
which &#13;
provided &#13;
flexibility &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
treasury, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
agreed &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
&#147;orderly &#13;
financing&#148; &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces, &#13;
so &#13;
that &#13;
they &#13;
would &#13;
no &#13;
longer &#13;
issue &#13;
quasi-monies, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
assume &#13;
and &#13;
renegotiate &#13;
the &#13;
provinces&#146; &#13;
debt &#13;
with &#13;
commercial &#13;
banks. &#13;
To &#13;
provide &#13;
a &#13;
context &#13;
for &#13;
this &#13;
support, &#13;
the &#13;
Nation-Provinces &#13;
Accord &#13;
obligated &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
to &#13;
enter &#13;
into &#13;
individual &#13;
&#147;bilateral &#13;
agreements&#148; &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
that &#13;
specified &#13;
agreed &#13;
deficit &#13;
reduction &#13;
targets &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
year3 &#13;
2 &#13;
In &#13;
general, &#13;
federal &#13;
revenues &#13;
eligible &#13;
for &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
include &#13;
VAT, &#13;
profit &#13;
and &#13;
excise &#13;
taxes, &#13;
but &#13;
exclude &#13;
foreign &#13;
trade &#13;
taxes &#13;
which &#13;
pertain &#13;
solely &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government. &#13;
The &#13;
Nation-Provinces &#13;
Accord &#13;
widened &#13;
the &#13;
tax- &#13;
sharing &#13;
base &#13;
to &#13;
include &#13;
30 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
recently &#13;
introduced &#13;
financial &#13;
transaction &#13;
tax. &#13;
In &#13;
addition &#13;
to &#13;
federal &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
also &#13;
rely &#13;
heavily &#13;
on &#13;
local &#13;
property &#13;
taxes &#13;
and &#13;
local &#13;
sales &#13;
and &#13;
business &#13;
taxes. &#13;
These &#13;
bilateral &#13;
agreements &#13;
stipulated &#13;
the &#13;
amounts &#13;
of &#13;
orderly &#13;
financing &#13;
and &#13;
debt &#13;
refinancing &#13;
that &#13;
each &#13;
province &#13;
could &#13;
expect &#13;
to &#13;
receive, &#13;
provided &#13;
it &#13;
refrained &#13;
from &#13;
emitting &#13;
any &#13;
more &#13;
quasi-monies, &#13;
from &#13;
contracting &#13;
new &#13;
debt, &#13;
or &#13;
increasing &#13;
its &#13;
outstanding &#13;
stock &#13;
of &#13;
arrears. &#13;
Penalties &#13;
were &#13;
stipulated &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
breach &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
agreements, &#13;
including &#13;

As &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
switch &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
proportional &#13;
formula &#13;
for &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing, &#13;
transfers &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
fell &#13;
significantly &#13;
in &#13;
March &#13;
and &#13;
April &#13;
of &#13;
2002 &#13;
to &#13;
about &#13;
Ar$715 &#13;
million &#13;
per &#13;
month. &#13;
Meanwhile, &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
economy &#13;
began &#13;
to &#13;
stabilize &#13;
in &#13;
May &#13;
and &#13;
national &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues &#13;
began &#13;
to &#13;
rise &#13;
(see &#13;
graphs &#13;
in &#13;
preceding &#13;
section). &#13;
With &#13;
this &#13;
turnaround, &#13;
transfers &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
also &#13;
rose &#13;
to &#13;
an &#13;
average &#13;
of &#13;
Ar$l, &#13;
180 &#13;
million &#13;
per &#13;
month &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
five &#13;
months &#13;
through &#13;
September, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
Ar$1,400 &#13;
million &#13;
per &#13;
month &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
three &#13;
months &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
year. &#13;
For &#13;
2002 &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
whole, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
received &#13;
A.r$l3.9 &#13;
billion &#13;
in &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
transfers, &#13;
an &#13;
average &#13;
of &#13;
Ar$l,l60 &#13;
per &#13;
month, &#13;
about &#13;
equal &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
reduced &#13;
guaranteed &#13;
amount &#13;
that &#13;
was &#13;
set &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
now &#13;
superceded &#13;
Second &#13;
Addenda. &#13;
24 &#13;
In &#13;
conclusion, &#13;
this &#13;
condition &#13;
is &#13;
considered &#13;
to &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
met &#13;
because &#13;
although &#13;
the &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
transfers &#13;
were &#13;
less &#13;
than &#13;
stipulated &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
condition, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
continued &#13;
to &#13;
observe &#13;
its &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
agreements &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
throughout &#13;
the &#13;
period. &#13;
The &#13;
amendments &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
inter-governmental &#13;
fiscal &#13;
relations &#13;
legislation &#13;
that &#13;
occurred &#13;
during &#13;
this &#13;
period &#13;
provided &#13;
benefits &#13;
to &#13;
both &#13;
parties- &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
form &#13;
of &#13;
greater &#13;
flexibility &#13;
in &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
form &#13;
of &#13;
reduced &#13;
interest &#13;
expenses &#13;
and &#13;
assured &#13;
orderly &#13;
financing &#13;
to &#13;
cover &#13;
pre-determined &#13;
deficit &#13;
levels &#13;
and &#13;
other &#13;
debt &#13;
service &#13;
obligations. &#13;
The &#13;
resulting &#13;
outcome, &#13;
discussed &#13;
further &#13;
below, &#13;
contributed &#13;
significantly &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
finances &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
most &#13;
difficult &#13;
of &#13;
periods, &#13;
thus &#13;
permitting, &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
extent &#13;
possible, &#13;
the &#13;
continuation &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
programs &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
provinces, &#13;
which &#13;

For &#13;
purposes &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
Schedule, &#13;
&#147;provincial &#13;
fiscal &#13;
deficit&#148; &#13;
means &#13;
the &#13;
difference &#13;
between &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
expenditures &#13;
accrued &#13;
(gasto &#13;
devengado) &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;

the &#13;
Government &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Autonomous &#13;

and &#13;
public &#13;

received &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;

and &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;

(excluding &#13;

the &#13;

with &#13;

to &#13;

their &#13;
assets). &#13;
25 &#13;
This &#13;
condition &#13;
has &#13;
not &#13;
been &#13;
met, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
waiver &#13;
is &#13;
proposed &#13;
in &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
subsequent &#13;
actions &#13;
that &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
taken &#13;
to &#13;
rectify &#13;
the &#13;
situation. &#13;
This &#13;
condition &#13;
aimed &#13;
at &#13;
containing &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
provincial &#13;
fiscal &#13;
deficit &#13;
at &#13;
Ar$2.76 &#13;
billion &#13;
in &#13;
2001, &#13;
as &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Government&#146;s &#13;
medium-term &#13;
strategy &#13;
for &#13;
reaching &#13;
fiscal &#13;
equilibrium &#13;
by &#13;
2005. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
event, &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
provincial &#13;
deficit &#13;
the &#13;
withholding &#13;
of &#13;
orderly &#13;
financing &#13;
and &#13;
deductions &#13;
from &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing. &#13;
Finally, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
also &#13;
agreed &#13;
to &#13;
standards &#13;
for &#13;
reporting &#13;
and &#13;
monitoring &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
disclosure &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
public. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
end, &#13;
bilateral &#13;
agreements &#13;
were &#13;
signed &#13;
with &#13;
17 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
24 &#13;
provinces &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
course &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
which &#13;
covered &#13;
all &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
large &#13;
provinces &#13;
and &#13;
those &#13;
accounting &#13;
for &#13;
more &#13;
than &#13;
90 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
provincial &#13;
deficit &#13;
in &#13;
2001. &#13;
The &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
assumed &#13;
$24 &#13;
billion &#13;
of &#13;
provincial &#13;
commercial &#13;
debt, &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
are &#13;
to &#13;
repay &#13;
(including &#13;
an &#13;
adjustment &#13;
for &#13;
inflation) &#13;
over &#13;
16 &#13;
years &#13;
(including &#13;
3 &#13;
years &#13;
grace) &#13;
at &#13;
2 &#13;
percent &#13;
interest. &#13;
Page  10&#13;
10 &#13;
for &#13;
2001 &#13;
rose &#13;
to &#13;
Ar$6.37 &#13;
billion, &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
accelerating &#13;
interest &#13;
costs, &#13;
declining &#13;
revenues, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
failure &#13;
to &#13;
restrain &#13;
current &#13;
expenditures &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
year. &#13;
26 &#13;
The &#13;
justification &#13;
for &#13;
granting &#13;
a &#13;
waiver &#13;
for &#13;
this &#13;
condition &#13;
is &#13;
that &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
actions &#13;
taken &#13;
to &#13;
constrain &#13;
provincial &#13;
deficits &#13;
via &#13;
the &#13;
bilateral &#13;
accords &#13;
that &#13;
were &#13;
described &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
preceding &#13;
condition, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
reduced &#13;
their &#13;
consolidated &#13;
deficit &#13;
to &#13;
Ar$l.77 &#13;
billion &#13;
in &#13;
2002, &#13;
an &#13;
amount &#13;
considerably &#13;
below &#13;
the &#13;
condition&#146;s &#13;
target &#13;
for &#13;
2001. &#13;
Important &#13;
factors &#13;
that &#13;
contributed &#13;
to &#13;
this &#13;
result &#13;
were &#13;
increased &#13;
revenue &#13;
performance &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
provinces&#146; &#13;
own &#13;
sources &#13;
of &#13;
revenue, &#13;
a &#13;
sharp &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
capital &#13;
expenditures, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
interest &#13;
savings &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government&#146;s &#13;
refinancing &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
provinces&#146; &#13;
debt &#13;
with &#13;
commercial &#13;
banks. &#13;
As &#13;
a &#13;
result, &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
reduced &#13;
their &#13;
consolidated &#13;
overall &#13;
deficit &#13;
from &#13;
2.4 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
to &#13;
0.6 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2002, &#13;
which &#13;
signifies &#13;
a &#13;
significant &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
and &#13;
is &#13;
in &#13;
line &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
intention &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
of &#13;
moving &#13;
towards &#13;
fiscal &#13;
equilibrium &#13;
by &#13;
2005. &#13;
27 &#13;
The &#13;
prospects &#13;
for &#13;
2003 &#13;
are &#13;
equally &#13;
encouraging. &#13;
The &#13;
provinces &#13;
are &#13;
again &#13;
entering &#13;
bilateral &#13;
agreements &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
(eight &#13;

the &#13;

sector &#13;
nationwide &#13;
(about &#13;
10.2 &#13;

including &#13;

The &#13;
objective &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
change &#13;
was &#13;
to &#13;
adjust &#13;
the &#13;
compensation &#13;
mechanism &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
per &#13;
contributor &#13;
basis &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
per &#13;
capita &#13;
basis, &#13;
which &#13;
would &#13;
provide &#13;
more &#13;
equity &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
financing &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
minimum &#13;
benefit &#13;
package &#13;
by &#13;
shifting &#13;
resources &#13;

each &#13;

was &#13;
halted &#13;

For &#13;
purposes &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
paragraph, &#13;
Pensiones &#13;
Asistenciales &#13;
means &#13;
a &#13;
subcategory &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Borrower&#146;s &#13;
non-contributory &#13;
pension &#13;
(PNC) &#13;
regime. &#13;
37 &#13;
This &#13;
condition &#13;
has &#13;
not &#13;
been &#13;
met &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
legal &#13;
challenges &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;

and &#13;
a &#13;

is &#13;
proposed. &#13;
Shortly &#13;
after &#13;
Board &#13;
approval &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SAL, &#13;
the &#13;
Chief &#13;
of &#13;
Cabinet &#13;
Office &#13;
submitted &#13;
a &#13;
proposal &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;

for &#13;
consolidating &#13;
non-contributory &#13;
pension &#13;
benefits &#13;
(pensiones &#13;
asistenciales) &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
per-child &#13;

and &#13;
the &#13;
minimum &#13;
old-age &#13;
pension &#13;
(universal &#13;
benefit), &#13;
as &#13;
defined &#13;
in &#13;
Decree &#13;
13 &#13;
82 &#13;
of &#13;
November &#13;
2001. &#13;
Specifically, &#13;
the &#13;
existing &#13;
non-contributory &#13;
pension &#13;
for &#13;
mothers &#13;
with &#13;
seven &#13;
or &#13;
more &#13;
children &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
eliminated &#13;
(due &#13;
to &#13;
overlap &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
per-child &#13;
benefit), &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
existing &#13;
old-age &#13;
benefit &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
phased &#13;
out, &#13;
with &#13;
all &#13;
new &#13;
applicants &#13;
referred &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
universal &#13;

38 &#13;
The &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
changes &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
blocked, &#13;
however, &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;
judicial &#13;
challenge &#13;
brought &#13;
by &#13;
a &#13;
group &#13;
of &#13;
National &#13;
Deputies &#13;
against &#13;
the &#13;
underlying &#13;
law, &#13;
Presidential &#13;
Decree &#13;
1306 &#13;
of &#13;
December &#13;
29,2000, &#13;
which &#13;
provided &#13;
for &#13;
significant &#13;
reforms &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
State-run &#13;
national &#13;
pension &#13;
system &#13;
and &#13;
provided &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
authority &#13;
to &#13;
proceed &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
changes &#13;
referred &#13;
to &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
preceding &#13;
paragraph. &#13;
The &#13;
legal &#13;
challenge, &#13;
which &#13;
questions &#13;
the &#13;
constitutionality &#13;
of &#13;
Decree &#13;
1306100, &#13;
advanced &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Supreme &#13;

in &#13;
February &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
but &#13;
has &#13;
not &#13;
yet &#13;
been &#13;
adjudicated. &#13;
39 &#13;
The &#13;
existence &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
legal &#13;
challenge &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
risk &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
proposed &#13;
reforms &#13;
would &#13;
not &#13;
be &#13;

of &#13;
the &#13;
Memorandum &#13;

the &#13;
President &#13;

Since &#13;
then, &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
has &#13;
taken &#13;
the &#13;
steps &#13;
that &#13;
it &#13;
could &#13;
to &#13;
implement &#13;
the &#13;
condition, &#13;
including &#13;
action &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
appellate &#13;
courts &#13;
arguing &#13;
against &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
challenge &#13;
to &#13;
Decree &#13;
1306100. &#13;
As &#13;
yet, &#13;
there &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
no &#13;

the &#13;
Supreme &#13;

on &#13;
how &#13;
it &#13;
will &#13;
rule, &#13;

the &#13;
Government &#13;
is &#13;
thus &#13;
prevented &#13;
from &#13;
implementing &#13;
the &#13;

On &#13;

in &#13;
February &#13;
of &#13;
2003, &#13;
bringing &#13;
the &#13;

program &#13;
during &#13;

detailed &#13;
evaluation &#13;
of &#13;
each &#13;
agency&#146;s &#13;
objectives &#13;

administrative &#13;

a &#13;

that &#13;
this &#13;

During &#13;

the &#13;

Again, &#13;
as &#13;
mentioned &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;

has &#13;
shifted &#13;
to &#13;

A &#13;
new &#13;

for &#13;
the &#13;
direct &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
by&#146; &#13;
ANSES &#13;
was &#13;
designed &#13;
in &#13;
September &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
steps &#13;
towards &#13;
its &#13;
implementation &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
underway &#13;
since &#13;
then. &#13;
Under &#13;
the &#13;
still &#13;
current &#13;
system, &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
for &#13;
most &#13;
employees &#13;
are &#13;
paid &#13;
by &#13;
their &#13;
employers, &#13;
which &#13;
deduct &#13;
these &#13;
payments &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
security &#13;
taxes &#13;
that &#13;
they &#13;
otherwise &#13;
owe &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Government. &#13;
This &#13;
arrangement &#13;
has &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
abuses &#13;
and &#13;
fraud, &#13;
as &#13;
some &#13;
workers &#13;
had &#13;
jobs &#13;
with &#13;
multiple &#13;
employers, &#13;
or &#13;
had &#13;
spouses &#13;
who &#13;
are &#13;
also &#13;
employed, &#13;
thus &#13;
leading &#13;
to &#13;
duplicate &#13;
payments. &#13;
Under &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
system, &#13;
ANSES &#13;
would &#13;
make &#13;
all &#13;
payments &#13;
for &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
directly &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
beneficiaries, &#13;
thus &#13;
avoiding &#13;
double &#13;
payments &#13;
and &#13;
reducing &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
cost &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
allowances &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
State. &#13;

Since &#13;
the &#13;

social &#13;
protection &#13;
policy &#13;
and &#13;
delaying &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
payments &#13;
system &#13;
for &#13;
several &#13;
months. &#13;
Work &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
informatics &#13;
and &#13;
regulations &#13;
needed &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
payment &#13;
system &#13;
resumed &#13;
toward &#13;
the &#13;
middle &#13;
of &#13;
2002. &#13;
66 &#13;
The &#13;
new &#13;
direct &#13;
payments &#13;
system &#13;
has &#13;
now &#13;
been &#13;
fully &#13;
designed &#13;
and &#13;
tested, &#13;
and &#13;
ANSES &#13;
has &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
budget &#13;
allocation &#13;
to &#13;
begin &#13;
implementation. &#13;
This &#13;
budget &#13;
aspect &#13;
is &#13;
important, &#13;
because &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
ANSES &#13;
will &#13;
pay &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
in &#13;
advance &#13;
of &#13;
when &#13;
it &#13;
will &#13;
receive &#13;
the &#13;
corresponding &#13;
contributions &#13;
from &#13;
employers &#13;
that &#13;
will &#13;
no &#13;
longer &#13;
pay &#13;
these &#13;
allowances &#13;
to &#13;
their &#13;
workers. &#13;
There &#13;
is &#13;
thus &#13;
a &#13;
cash &#13;
flow &#13;
cost &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Government &#13;
in &#13;
switching &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
existing &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
direct &#13;
payment &#13;
system. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
medium &#13;
term, &#13;
there &#13;
will &#13;
nevertheless &#13;
be &#13;
savings &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
reduced &#13;
fraud &#13;
and &#13;
double &#13;
payments. &#13;
These &#13;
savings &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
estimated &#13;
at &#13;
Ar$300 &#13;
million &#13;
per &#13;
annum, &#13;
so &#13;
there &#13;
is &#13;
a &#13;
strong &#13;
incentive &#13;
to &#13;
make &#13;
the &#13;
switch. &#13;

ANSES &#13;
has &#13;
prepared &#13;
an &#13;
internal &#13;
resolution &#13;
to &#13;
commence &#13;
using &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
payment &#13;
system &#13;
in &#13;
May &#13;
2003. &#13;
It &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
first &#13;
applied &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
221,000 &#13;
beneficiaries, &#13;
about &#13;
15 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
total &#13;
eligible &#13;
beneficiaries &#13;
(versus &#13;
the &#13;
20 &#13;
percent &#13;
target &#13;
stipulated &#13;
in &#13;
annex &#13;
8 &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
State &#13;
Modernization &#13;
letter), &#13;
that &#13;
are &#13;
currently &#13;
being &#13;
paid &#13;
directly &#13;
by &#13;
ANSES. &#13;
ANSES &#13;
will &#13;
then &#13;
start &#13;
incorporating &#13;
beneficiaries &#13;
province &#13;
by &#13;
province &#13;
beginning &#13;
in &#13;
August &#13;
2003, &#13;
with &#13;
one &#13;
province &#13;
to &#13;
enter &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
every &#13;
two &#13;
months &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
rest &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
year, &#13;
and &#13;
one &#13;
province &#13;
every &#13;
month &#13;
thereafter. &#13;
The &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
should &#13;
thus &#13;
be &#13;
fully &#13;
implemented &#13;
in &#13;
2005. &#13;
68 &#13;
In &#13;
sum, &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
payments &#13;
system &#13;
was &#13;
setback &#13;
by &#13;
uncertainties &#13;
concerning &#13;
the &#13;
direction &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
protection &#13;
policy &#13;
and &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
technical &#13;
complications &#13;
of &#13;
implementing &#13;
an &#13;
information &#13;
and &#13;
payments &#13;
system &#13;
that &#13;
will &#13;
cover &#13;
1.5 &#13;
million &#13;
families. &#13;
The &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
tested &#13;
and &#13;
is &#13;
now &#13;
ready &#13;
to &#13;
implement. &#13;
Training &#13;
of &#13;
ANSES &#13;
staff &#13;
has &#13;
begun &#13;
with &#13;
financial &#13;
support &#13;
through &#13;
another &#13;
Bank &#13;
project &#13;
(ANSES &#13;
Technical &#13;
Assistance &#13;
Loan, &#13;
No. &#13;
413 &#13;
l- &#13;
AR), &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
will &#13;
thus &#13;
continue &#13;
monitoring &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
payments &#13;
system. &#13;
On &#13;
this &#13;
basis, &#13;
there &#13;
are &#13;
reasonable &#13;
expectations &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
implemented &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
near &#13;
future, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
waiver &#13;
is &#13;
therefore &#13;
proposed. &#13;

over &#13;

IV. &#13;
Benefits &#13;
and &#13;
Risks &#13;
71 &#13;
The &#13;
main &#13;
benefits &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
program &#13;
are &#13;
greater &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
efficiency &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
administration &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
programs &#13;
in &#13;
particular &#13;
and &#13;
of &#13;
government &#13;
in &#13;
general. &#13;
Unified &#13;
and &#13;
consolidated &#13;
data &#13;
bases &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
created &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
areas &#13;
of &#13;
health &#13;
insurance, &#13;
social &#13;
assistance &#13;
and &#13;
Page  22&#13;
22 &#13;
taxpayer &#13;
information &#13;
(including &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
level). &#13;
These &#13;
data &#13;
bases &#13;
and &#13;
systems &#13;
should &#13;
contribute &#13;
to &#13;
reduced &#13;
fraud, &#13;
better &#13;
administration, &#13;
and &#13;
significant &#13;
savings &#13;
which &#13;
will &#13;
allow &#13;
for &#13;
increased &#13;
services &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
same &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
expenditure. &#13;
Two &#13;
indications &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
savings &#13;
that &#13;
will &#13;
accrue &#13;
to &#13;
Government &#13;
are &#13;
those &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
audits &#13;
(over &#13;
Ar$500 &#13;
million &#13;
per &#13;
annum &#13;
in &#13;
both &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
2002) &#13;
and &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
direct &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;
family &#13;
allowances &#13;
(annual &#13;
savings &#13;
of &#13;
A.r$300 &#13;
million &#13;
starting &#13;
in &#13;
2004105). &#13;
72 &#13;
The &#13;
public &#13;
will &#13;
benefit &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
freedom &#13;
to &#13;
choose &#13;
among &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
programs, &#13;
leading &#13;
to &#13;
greater &#13;
competition &#13;
and &#13;
efficiency &#13;
in &#13;
this &#13;
area. &#13;
The &#13;
public &#13;
will &#13;
also &#13;
benefit &#13;
from &#13;
improved &#13;
taxpayer &#13;
services, &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
selectivity &#13;
in &#13;
customs &#13;
inspections, &#13;
and &#13;
from &#13;
improved &#13;
social &#13;
assistance &#13;
services, &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
reduced &#13;
backlogs &#13;
and &#13;
waiting &#13;
times &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
processing &#13;
of &#13;
pension &#13;
applications &#13;
and &#13;
family &#13;
allowances. &#13;
This &#13;
will &#13;
increase &#13;
confidence &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
quality &#13;
and &#13;
transparency &#13;
of &#13;
government. &#13;
Increased &#13;
transparency &#13;
will &#13;
also &#13;
result &#13;
from &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
procurement &#13;
legislation &#13;
that &#13;
provides &#13;
for &#13;
electronic &#13;
procurement &#13;
and &#13;
facilitates &#13;
public &#13;
access &#13;
to &#13;
procurement &#13;
information. &#13;
Finally, &#13;
the &#13;
general &#13;
quality &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
administration &#13;
should &#13;
improve &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
new &#13;
&#147;management &#13;
by &#13;
results&#148; &#13;
management &#13;
system &#13;
which &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
installed &#13;
in &#13;
five &#13;
agencies &#13;
of &#13;
government &#13;
and &#13;
appears &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
spreading &#13;
to &#13;
others. &#13;
73 &#13;
The &#13;
main &#13;
risks &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
program &#13;
stem &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
still &#13;
fragile &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
situation &#13;
and &#13;
from &#13;
possible &#13;
further &#13;
deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
environment. &#13;
A &#13;
setback &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
revival &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
economy, &#13;
or &#13;
deviation &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
agreed &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
program &#13;
could &#13;
undo &#13;
the &#13;
considerable &#13;
gains &#13;
that &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
made &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
provincial &#13;
finances. &#13;
Also, &#13;
uncertainties &#13;
related &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
upcoming &#13;
presidential &#13;
election, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
congressional &#13;
elections &#13;
later &#13;
this &#13;
year, &#13;
pose &#13;
further &#13;
risks &#13;
to &#13;
continued &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program. &#13;
74 &#13;
. &#13;
Nevertheless, &#13;
the &#13;
institutional &#13;
improvements &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
SAL &#13;
program &#13;
(such &#13;
as &#13;
improved &#13;
data &#13;
bases, &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
administration &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
protection &#13;
programs) &#13;
are &#13;
likely &#13;
to &#13;
remain &#13;
intact, &#13;
since &#13;
the &#13;
great &#13;
majority &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
measures &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
internalized &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
respective &#13;
agencies &#13;
and &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
in &#13;
place &#13;
for &#13;
over &#13;
one &#13;
year. &#13;
These &#13;
are &#13;
therefore &#13;
likely &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
sustainable &#13;
into &#13;
the &#13;
future &#13;
even &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
reversal &#13;
in &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
performance. &#13;
75 &#13;
Finally, &#13;
there &#13;
is &#13;
a &#13;
small &#13;
risk &#13;
of &#13;
reversal &#13;
with &#13;
two &#13;
measures &#13;
that &#13;
were &#13;
recently &#13;
adopted &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
form &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
&#147;Decree &#13;
of &#13;
Necessity &#13;
and &#13;
Urgency.&#148; &#13;
These &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
decrees &#13;
that &#13;
established &#13;
a &#13;
per &#13;
capita &#13;
redistribution &#13;
mechanism &#13;
among &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
funds &#13;
(para. &#13;
33) &#13;
and &#13;
that &#13;
modified &#13;
the &#13;
procurement &#13;
law &#13;
(para. &#13;
47). &#13;
Because &#13;
these &#13;
decrees &#13;
modify &#13;
existing &#13;
laws, &#13;
the &#13;
Constitution &#13;
requires &#13;
that &#13;
they &#13;
be &#13;
sent &#13;
to &#13;
Congress &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
an &#13;
opportunity &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
Legislature &#13;
to &#13;
ratify &#13;
or &#13;
derogate &#13;
the &#13;
decrees. &#13;
This &#13;
risk &#13;
is &#13;
mitigated &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
fact &#13;

            Argentina - Structural Adjustment Loan
            Project : Release of Tranche and Waiver of Three Conditions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This memorandum seeks Board approval for
            the release of the second tranche and waiver of conditions
            set due to the dramatic crisis Argentina has undergone. It
            summarizes the macroeconomic policies in place since early
            2002, the overall progress in implementing the reform
            program supported by the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)
            Project, and the actions taken by the Government of
            Argentina to meet specific conditions for release of the
            second tranche. However, three conditions were not met:
            namely a) reduction of the consolidated provincial fiscal
            deficit for 2001, b) implementing changes in the calculation
            of non-contributory pensions, and c) implementing a new
            system for the payment of family allowances. Waivers are
            proposed for the above three specific conditions, based on
            the overall strong implementation of the program and in view
            of the continuing macroeconomic stabilization, markedly
            improved fiscal performance of the provinces, the progress
            towards implementing a new payments system for family
            allowances, and the legal obstacles to the original pension
            reform measures.
