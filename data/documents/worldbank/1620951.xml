June 30, 1996&#13;
James D. Wolfensohn, President of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
(MIGA) and Chairman of its Board of Directors, submits to the Council of Governors,&#13;
on behalf of the Board of Directors and in accordance with MIGA's bylaws, this report&#13;
and audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996.&#13;
The Board of Directors is pleased to report that MIGA has had another excel-&#13;
lent year during which the grow-th of its guarantee operations exceeded expectations in&#13;
terms of the amount of new underwriting issued and premium income earned. MIGA's&#13;
investment promotion services also grew impressively, and an important service, the IPAnet,&#13;
was launched on the Internet.&#13;
MIGA's operations are designed to encourage the flow of private foreign direct&#13;
investment for productive purposes to and between developing member countries, thus&#13;
supporting development goals. During the fiscal year MIGA successfully pursued the&#13;
objectives set out in its Convention, supplementing the activities of the other members&#13;
of the World Bank Group.&#13;

MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
I am pleased to report on MIGA's achievements during fiscal 1996. On the&#13;
Guarantees side, MIGA continued to grow with a claims-free record and to diversify its&#13;
portfolio further under a prudent risk management policy. MIGA's guarantees have served&#13;
as a catalyst for foreign direct investments that now total an estimated $15 billion, about&#13;
seven times the total contingent liabilities outstanding in MIGA's portfolio of $2.3 bil-&#13;
lion. On the Investment Marketing Services side, MIGA launched its IPAnet, which is&#13;
now gaining intemational recognition on the World Wide Web.&#13;
During the fiscal year we conducted a customer survey, which revealed that MIGA's&#13;
Guarantee clients generally have a high regard for the Agency's services. Positive feedback&#13;
has been given on MIGA's client orientation, cost efficiency, and results orientation.&#13;
MIGA was created to supplement the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and other inter-&#13;
national development finance institutions by promoting private sector investment in de-&#13;
veloping countries, and to complement the activities of national agencies and private&#13;
investment risk insurers. To this end the Guarantees Department's cooperation with other&#13;
insurers and the Investment Marketing Services Department's support of national invest-&#13;
ment promotion agencies are models of complementarity.&#13;
During fiscal 1996 MIGA began to address the need for a future enhancement&#13;
of its capital base; this challenging exercise will continue through fiscal 1997. I am hope-&#13;
ful that MIGA's shareholder countries will support a reinforcement of its guarantee&#13;
capacity, allowing it to continue to fulfill its unique mandate to promote productive&#13;
foreign direct investment in the developing world.&#13;

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was established on April 12,&#13;
1988, as the newest member organization of the World Bank Group. Its purpose is to&#13;
encourage the flow of foreign direct investment to its developing member countries for&#13;
economic development. Its primary means of facilitating investment is through the provision&#13;
of investment guarantees against the risks of currency transfer, expropriation, and war and&#13;
civil disturbance ("political risks").&#13;

MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
STATEMENT OF AGENCY PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group. The Agency is designed to help developing countries&#13;
attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated&#13;
public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommer-&#13;
cial risks and a program of consultative and advisory services to promote improvements in&#13;
member countries' environments for foreign investment.&#13;
NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING&#13;
AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Account-&#13;
ing Standards. In the absence of such standards, then, subject to relevant legal requirements,&#13;
the policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA hav-&#13;
ing regard to the accounting principles used in the United States and the practices of other&#13;
international insurance entities. The accounting policies followed are consistent in all mate-&#13;
rial respects with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting Stan-&#13;
dards and generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates&#13;
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results&#13;
could differ from those estimates. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is&#13;
provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these financial statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the&#13;
purpose of summarizing MlGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the&#13;
convenience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of&#13;
all its members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its&#13;
members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency envi-&#13;
ronment. As such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency&#13;
with assets in the same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to&#13;
match the currencies underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies.&#13;
The purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur&#13;
through operations. Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for&#13;
small amounts required to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period.&#13;
Capital subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income&#13;
and expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect&#13;
during each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock&#13;
of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right&#13;
(SDR) in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;

such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR. The Convention further states that ten per-&#13;
cent of the members' shares be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that&#13;
developing member countries may pay up to a quarter of the ten percent in their own cur-&#13;
rencies. In addition, another ten percent of the members' shares shall be paid in the form of&#13;
nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely&#13;
convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet the Agency's obligations. The policies&#13;
relating to translation of currencies as described above also apply to the cash and the prom-&#13;
issory notes paid in.&#13;
Investments&#13;
Management has both the ability and intent to hold all investments to maturity. Accordingly,&#13;
MIGA's investment holdings are carried at cost or amortized cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed&#13;
and ceded is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commit-&#13;
ment fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee&#13;
capacity for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for losses inherent in guarantee operations based upon claim&#13;
submissions, consideration of loss experiences by insurers engaged in similar underwritings,&#13;
and other factors including changes in the composition and volume of the insurance and&#13;
outstanding guarantees and worldwide economic and political conditions. This reserve is&#13;
available to absorb losses related to insurance amounts outstanding, which are off-balance&#13;
sheet commitments. The reserve is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased&#13;
for claims settlements.&#13;
The periodic provision for claims is usually based on management's evaluation of potential&#13;
claim payments (net of expected recoveries) that may result from (i) risks that are inherent,&#13;
but unidentifiable at the time of writing; (ii) unusually large concentrations of exposure in&#13;
individual risks, countries, or guarantee contracts; and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGAs&#13;
expected recovery rates on its total portfolio. However, given the lack of historical claims&#13;
experience in MIGA, there is no actuarial or historical basis upon which to determine the&#13;
Agency's expected claims experience. Accordingly, management, with the approval of the&#13;
Board, relies on a premium-based methodology for establishing the reserve for claims.&#13;
Recognizing the fact that during the early years of the Agency's operations when its cash&#13;
reserves are small in relation to its obligations assumed under its insurance activities and&#13;
when there is limited history for estimation of losses, it is understood, in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of the Convention, that the promissory note portion of the subscribed capital&#13;
would be utilized to pay any claims in excess of the cash reserve. In this context, member&#13;
capital remains subject to direct risk. Considering the absence of historical claims experi-&#13;
ence, this risk is difficult to assess. However, it should be noted that under an extreme hypo-&#13;
thetical claims scenario, this risk could be considerable.&#13;
Acquisition Costs&#13;
Costs of acquiring investment insurance business are expensed in the year incurred, as such&#13;
amounts are not material.&#13;

due, and the remaining $847,155,000 ($834,283,000 - June 30, 1995) is subject to call by&#13;

$100,395,000 ($102,114,000 - June 30, 1995) is in the form of nonnegotiable, noninterest-&#13;
bearing demand obligations (promissory notes).&#13;
NOTE D: GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND CONTINGENT&#13;
LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantee Program. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncom-&#13;
mercial risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in devel-&#13;
oping member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different&#13;
categories of risk: currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of&#13;
contract. Currency transfer protects the investor from inconvertibility of local currency returns&#13;
and proceeds from the liquidation of the investment project into foreign exchange for transfer&#13;
outside the host country. Expropriation protects the investor against partial or total loss of&#13;
the insured investment as a result of acts by the host government which may reduce or&#13;
eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil dis-&#13;
turbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disap-&#13;
pearance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in&#13;
the host country. Breach of contract protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain&#13;
or to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the&#13;
host government. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the four types of&#13;
coverage. MIGA guarantees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated&#13;
unilaterally by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance.&#13;
Premium rates applicable to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all&#13;
claims under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under&#13;
the guarantee.&#13;
On July 28, 1995, the Board of Directors, pursuant to a resolution of the Council of Gover-&#13;
nors approved on February 8, 1994, accepted Management's recommendation to increase&#13;
the maximum aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by the Agency&#13;
from an approved interim of 250 percent to 350 percent of the sum of the Agency's unim-&#13;
paired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such portion of the insurance ceded by the&#13;
Agency through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accord-&#13;
ingly, at June 30, 1996, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may not exceed&#13;
$3,944,701,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guaran-&#13;
tees issued and outstanding at June 30, 1996 totaled $2,276,953,000 ($1,622,892,000 -&#13;
June 30, 1995). The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum expo-&#13;
sure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for wvhich MIGA is committed&#13;
but not currently at risk. At June 30, 1996, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insur-&#13;
ance claims exclusive of standby coverage is $1,547,221,000 ($1,150,156,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
At June 30, 1996, approximately 73 percent of the contingent liability represents guaran-&#13;
tees issued which will expire in or after fiscal year 2006.&#13;
The composition of the contingent liability including "current" and "standby" coverage un-&#13;
der guarantees issued and outstanding by host country and by guarantee currency is summa-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
Of the total contingent liability, $75,469,000 was ceded through contracts of reinsurance&#13;
($14,956,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
As of June 30, 1996, additional guarantee capacity amounting to $44,000,000 has been&#13;
committed ($210,000,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
Claim Activity. As of June 30,1996, there have been no claims lodged with theAgency. Two&#13;
disputes were reported during the fiscal year between insured investors and their host gov-&#13;
ernments. One of the disputes was resolved. MIGA was informed of the second dispute in&#13;
June 1996. In principle, the risk that triggered the dispute is not covered under the Contract&#13;
of Guarantee. The two disputes that were reported to the Agency as of June 30, 1995, have&#13;
been amicably resolved with the assistance of MIGA.&#13;
NOTE E: OTHER MATTERS&#13;
Service and Support Fee. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)&#13;
charges the Agency an annual Service and Support Fee, which for the fiscal year ending June&#13;
30, 1996 amounted to $719,000 ($700,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
StaffRetirement Plan. The IBRD has a defined benefit retirement plan (Plan) covering sub-&#13;
stantially all of the staff of the Agency, the IBRD, and the International Finance Corporation&#13;
(IFC). Under the Plan, benefits are based on years of service and average compensation, with&#13;
the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration, and the Agency, the&#13;
IBRD, and IFC contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan&#13;
benefits. The total contribution is based upon the aggregate funding method. All contribu-&#13;
tions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for the purposes of the Plan are held by&#13;
the IBRD separately from the other assets and income of the Agency, the IBRD, and IFC and&#13;
can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries until all&#13;
liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. The total expense allocated to the Agency&#13;
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 was $971,000 ($907,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
Other Post-Employment Benefits. The IBRD also provides certain life insurance and medical&#13;
benefits to substantially all retired staff of the Agency, the IBRD, and IFC and their spouses&#13;
through contributions to a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP). Commencing in 1990, the&#13;
Agency, the IBRD, and IFC began accruing and funding, on an actuarially determined basis,&#13;
the expected future cost of providing such benefits for future retirees. All contributions to&#13;
the RSBP and all other assets and income held for purposes of the RSBP are held separately&#13;
from the other assets and income of the Agency, the IBRD, and IFC and can be used only for&#13;
the benefit of the participants in the RSBP and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them&#13;
have been paid or provided for. The total expense allocated to the Agency for the fiscal year&#13;
ended June 30, 1996 was $263,000 ($208,000 - June 30, 1995).&#13;
NOTE F: ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES&#13;
The estimated fair values of the Agency's cash and nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing de-&#13;
mand obligations are assumed to approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value&#13;
of the Agency's investments shown in Note B, due to their short-term nature, is based on&#13;
market quotations. The estimated fair values are only indicative of individual financial in-&#13;
struments' values and should not be considered an indication of the fair value of the Agency.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 52 through 63 of this Report&#13;
present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial&#13;
position of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) at June 30, 1996 and&#13;
1995, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in&#13;
conformity with International Accounting Standards and with generally accepted ac-&#13;
counting principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility&#13;
of management of MIGA; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial&#13;
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accor-&#13;
dance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Standards on&#13;
Auditing, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-&#13;
ance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit&#13;
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in&#13;
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant esti-&#13;
mates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presenta-&#13;
tion. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed&#13;
above.&#13;
Note D discusses MIGAs guarantee program and recent increases in the maximum aggre-&#13;
gate amount of resultant contingent liabilities that mav be assumed by MIGA. As more&#13;
fully discussed in Note A under Reserve for Claims, given the lack of historical claims&#13;
experience, MIGA relies on a premium-based methodology for establishing the reserve&#13;
for claims and, in accordance with the MIGA Convention, the promissory demand note&#13;
portion of the subscribed capital would be utilized to pay any claims in excess of the cash&#13;
reserve (defined as reserve for claims plus retained earnings). This subjects member capi-&#13;
tal to direct risk which, under an extreme adverse claims scenario, could be considerable.&#13;
