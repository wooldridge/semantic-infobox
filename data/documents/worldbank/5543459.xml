consultative process for policy development&#13;
in the Water and Sanitation (W&amp;S) sector&#13;

in the ensuing transition stage. As part of&#13;

            These are the proceedings of the
            National Roundtable on Water and Sanitation in Transition,
            to discuss the new, emerging challenges in ensuring
            coverage, and quality of services. Organized by the Water
            and Sanitation Program - South Asia (WSP-SA), the workshop
            developed a consensus on capacity building needs, addressing
            critical issues confronting the sector in a decentralizing
            environment. An action plan was also prepared in order to
            phase an ensuring, sustainable service delivery. A briefing
            presented the background on key water supply and sanitation
            issues during the devolution transition period, and
            presentations from the provinces followed, on the process
            and state of decentralization. Two models for capacity
            building were presented, by WSP-SA, and the National Rural
            Support Programme (NRSP). Finally, recommendations were
            formulated both for the medium- and long-term planning.
