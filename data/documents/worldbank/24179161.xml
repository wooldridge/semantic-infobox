                A CONVERSATION WITH ALEXANDER STEVENSON                       Germany.     I had all the material. but I found it less fascinating than&#13;

                             WASHINGTON. D.C.                                 the Bank.     I never finished it, and I never regretted it.&#13;

                             November 18. 1985                                OLIVER:     So you came to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                             Robert W. Oliver                                 STEVENSON:     1 came into the Economics Department, and almost at once&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              that big discussion with the u.s. government occurred about control of&#13;
&#13;
          Sandy. let me begin by asking you to say a bit about how you        the management of the Bank.       Eugene Meyer, the President of the Bank&#13;
OLIVERI&#13;
&#13;
came to the Bank in the first place and about your career in the Bank.        and formally publisher of the Washington Post, resigned, thereby.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:   I was demobilized into Washington by a series of accidents       winning I think, the battle over the U.S. Executive Director, Pete&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              Collado.     Almost   ~ediately   after that, Harold Smith, who had come&#13;
and was working for the Treasury Department at the time the British&#13;
                                                                              from the Bureau of the Budget and was the Number Two. died.         When     got&#13;
loan was being signed.   I knew from before the war Antonio Basch who&#13;
&#13;
had been on the Czech delegation to Bretton Woods.     He bad joined the      to the Bank, the staff did not quite know who was in charge: what&#13;
&#13;
Fund and transferred to the Bank, and he called me one day and said,          thought I had joined in Winter 1986 waâ&#128;¢ very different when I got to&#13;
&#13;
"Why donâ&#128;¢ t you join the Bank?"   I had just left the Treasury and was        the Bank in the Spring of 1947.&#13;
&#13;
working on my thesis under a Social Science Research Council                              Things were even more different because the role of the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              Economics Department had been changed and considerably reduced.            The&#13;
Demobilizati on Fellow&amp;hip, but I decided I couldn't afford to wait; I&#13;
&#13;
had to take this position.                                                    country work went into what was then the Loan Department, but it wasn't&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   What University were you working at?                                until late in 1951 that I moved into work on loans and then transferred&#13;
&#13;
                                                            So I joined the   into the Operations Department.        Europe, Africa and Australia in the&#13;
STEVENSON:   At the University of california, Berkeley.&#13;
                                                           They told me I     1952 reorganizatio n.     We were not so fussy in those days about job&#13;
Bank, and thought that I would finish my thesis there.&#13;
                                                                              descriptiouâ&#128;¢ and we didn't have so many titles.        I remember that. as a&#13;
could have tiae, but I realized, after I joined, that that was foolish.&#13;
&#13;
You had to give the time to the job or you weren't going to get               division chief. I used to try to avoid labelling staff members either&#13;
&#13;
anywhere, and there was too much to do.     I also became progressivel y      "loan officer" or "economist," because I thought that staff members who&#13;
&#13;
                                                 It was on the                were trained economists should work on loans if they had the talent and&#13;
disenchanted with the subject of my thesis.&#13;
                                                                               inclination.    That was easier to do when the Bank was small.      Jobs&#13;
Internationa l Dyestuffs Cartel, which I had worked on a little bit&#13;
                                                                              were less split up, and many of us were loan officers -- operations&#13;
before I went into the ArmJ and then again after the war was over in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                4&#13;
                                                                3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
officers -- as well as economists.                                                imply that the loan officer for, let's say, India would see the, say,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well. many of the loan officers. including many who eventually        Finance Minister or the head of the central bank and that they would&#13;
&#13;
rose to be vice presidents. were economists by training anyhow. were              work out some sort of an agreement that started with some sort of a&#13;
&#13;
they not7                                                                         standard format that the Bank bad worked out over time, and the&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     I think when I was a division chief I had only one or two          economic advisor wouldn't even be present?&#13;
&#13;
                                                        I always preferred        STEVENSON:    He would probably not be present either in discussions in the&#13;
loan officers who were not trained as economists.&#13;
                                                                                  country or during final negotiations .    A country economist would be&#13;
to have trained economists: if you had only one maO on a country. it&#13;
&#13;
was better if he knew something about the economics of the country than           present in many of the discussions, but he reported to the division&#13;
&#13;
                                              Of course. it waa always            chief, not to the economic advisor.      If an economic report was being&#13;
if he bad to have somebody else with him.&#13;
&#13;
better to have two people as a minimum and we usually did.                        written, it waa written by people under the control of the division&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  chief rather than the economic adviaor.     The economic advisor found it&#13;
OLIVER:     It has never been clear to me. since I have not had the&#13;
&#13;
opportunity of working in an operating department. what the                       difficult to be very influential because, though mission terms of&#13;
&#13;
relationship was between the division chief (or chief loan officer). on           reference would perhaps have been discussed with him, it was in the&#13;
&#13;
the one hand. and the economic advisor. on the other hand.                        field that the mission found out all sorts of things and decided what&#13;
&#13;
               Well. they often didn't work it out very well.       The problem   kind of a scenario it had.    Once you set a plot, it is difficult . . â&#128;¢&#13;
STEVENSON:&#13;
                                                                                  OLIVER:   What are some of the major things that were negotiated in a&#13;
arose from the fact that the chief economic adviaor was a staff&#13;
                                                                                  loan contract?    I suppose there is some detailed description of the&#13;
position while the chief loan officer in charge of a group of&#13;
&#13;
countries was a line position.     It was a line job.    The economic             project, some notion of the total amount the Bank is likely to lend.&#13;
&#13;
advisors always felt, I think, a little frustrated because they weren't            something about the interest rate and that sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
                                               It's not very easy to               STEVENSON:   There would normally not be much discussion about the exact&#13;
present when things were being worked out.&#13;
                                                                                   amounts and none about the rate of interest. Thet would be set at the&#13;
influence things after the outlines of an operation have taken shape.&#13;
                                                                                   time the loan was prepared for the Boerd.     Host of the discussion was&#13;
It's difficult to change the whole concept.     The miasion has returned&#13;
                                                                                   about special covenants which had to do with the project itself.     They&#13;

                                                                                   might have to do with the financial covenants, with a company's&#13;
things.&#13;
                                                                                   operationa: or they might have to do with. say. irrigation policy if&#13;
OLIVER:     When you talk about the negotiation of a loan, do you mean to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             5                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the project was an agricultural project.   There were provisions which         on the mission. and once the draft had been written. you couldn't bring&#13;
&#13;
related to the development and running of the project.    There might be       in new topics because you probably didn't have adequate material.     Very&#13;
&#13;
some discussion about matters of general policy. say. an aspect of             often. the economic advisor found himself on the outside looking in.&#13;
&#13;
agricultural price policy. but those matters were not usually                  criticizing and unable to have a very strong influence on what came&#13;
&#13;
incorporated in covenants. Matters such as price policy in general came        out.&#13;
&#13;
to be discussed only with what later became known as program loans.       Of   OLIVER:   What would happen hypothetically if an economic advisor said.&#13;
&#13;
course the enforcement of covenants relating to such matters is much           "This project doesn't seem anywhere nearly as important as another&#13;
&#13;
more difficult and aucb more chancey.   Host of the loan covenants had         project that you haven't even talked about yet?"&#13;
&#13;
to do with the way the project was going to be run. how it fitted in --        STEVENSON:   Well. before the mission went out. the mission would have&#13;
&#13;
if it was a tranâ&#128;¢portation project, with the transportation 1ystem (if         had terms of reference.   If he'd had anything to do with the&#13;
&#13;
it was a big enough project to make any difference).     Such covenants        terms of reference. that would have been the time to have said that.&#13;
&#13;
didn't have very much impact on the general econoay.     In the early days     The difficulty for him would have been that he might say. "You&#13;
&#13;
the Bank didn't bother too much with the economic rate of return in a          should be lending in transportation. you should have been lending in&#13;
&#13;
power project.   Only later did that become standard practice.                 agriculture."   But it is very difficult to push that more than to make&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   So the economic advisor to an operating department would be          a general statement about it.    Perhaps the government didn't want the&#13;
&#13;
Confronted with e proposed loan whose details in terms of the                  Bank lending in agriculture.    Perhaps the Bankâ&#128;¢ a operating people felt&#13;
&#13;
engineering implementation and the relation of the project to the              that they would get mired down in a lot of work and it would take a&#13;
&#13;
sector were pretty well worked out before he saw the loan paper.     What      tremendous amount of time to work out a project they might not be able&#13;
&#13;
was the economic advisor then aupposed to do?                                  to do to their satisfaction.    There might be problems of agricultural&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:   He spent more time looking at the country economic work           policy that they didn't think the Bank could do much about anyway.     So,&#13;
&#13;
that the department did -- the economic reports on India. say. or any          it was very difficult to go beyond a general statement.&#13;
&#13;
of the countries where loans were being made.   There. too. the mission        OLIVER:   Do you remember any occasion when the government had its heart&#13;
&#13;
had written a draft before the economic advisor saw it.     He might have      set. so to speak. on some project that might have appealed to the king&#13;
&#13;
had something to do with the terms of reference of the mission. but not        or the prime minister or whatever and the economic advisor was obliged&#13;
&#13;
in every case.   People who were writing the draft had done their thing        to say that it didn't make any econoaic sense?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              7                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:   No, I don't. The Bank had, of course, relatively small         S1~ENSON:    Yes.   The economic   advis~r   reported to the department&#13;
&#13;
resources to put in compared to all the development financing that was      director as did the division chief. so the influence the economic&#13;

&#13;
more of this in Asia at that time than in Latin America, was to try to      If he were to say. NLook here. we shouldn't be lending very much to&#13;
&#13;
analyze in an econoeic report whether the Bank should be lending, in        this country.'' and could persuade the department director that that he&#13;
&#13;
what general magnitude, and in what fields.                                 was right, then, when the mission terms of reference would get set&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Priorities.                                                       down, that would be reflected.       If he wasn't involved at that stage. he&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:   Priorities, but also priorities in the sense of where the      had lost the battle.&#13;
&#13;
Bank could be effective in lending.    In the early days, we might have     OLIVER:   Was there an acceptance early on of the proposition that&#13;
&#13;
thought that education or health was important, but the Bank wasn't         borrowed funds wisely used by a country might increase the&#13;
&#13;
lending in those sectors: we didn't have the possibility of analyzing       creditworthiness of the country?&#13;
&#13;
projects in those fields: we lent in fields where the staff was             STEVENSON:   Oh I think so.   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
qualified.                                                                  OLIVER:   And how about the proposition that development programs where&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was it just a quirk of fate that many of the engineers who        the various projects fit together in some coherent way also made the&#13;
&#13;
came in the Bank into the early days were civil engineers who were          country more creditworthy and the rate of economic development greater&#13;
&#13;
themselves concerned. and their own experiences were. with roads and        than otherwise1&#13;

dams and power plants1                                                      STEVENSON:   Oh I think so.   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:   Well. I think that people did think of that as a major         OLIVER:   So the notion of a development program was in no sense&#13;
&#13;
aspect of development.     Take the first EDI courses:   what everyone      contrary to the idea of financing individual projects1&#13;
&#13;
wanted to see on a field trip would be the Tennessee Valley Authority.      STEVENSON:   I don't think so.     As a matter of fact, the Executive&#13;
&#13;

OLIVER:   Well. back to the role of the economic advisors.     Was it a     lending to India. it was the development plan that we should be lending&#13;

function of the economic advisors to say something about the                for.   The Bank didn't buy that; it recognized the wisdom of what he&#13;
&#13;
limitations a country had on its overall borrowing. in another words,       said. but, in relation to the total development program of India, the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            Bank resources would have been miniscule anyway.        The Bank always&#13;
its creditworthiness. absorptive capacity, and that sort of thing.&#13;

preferred to say. "O.K. that's all right, but we do what we think we             did Escott Reid come to the Bank, and when did he leave?    You were&#13;
&#13;
know we can do, and what we think is iaportant. and what we think we             deputy under him?&#13;
&#13;
can have some influence on."                                                     STEVENSON:    I was deputy under him.   I was deputy when Geoffrey Wilson&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     A little bit later, I would like to ask a question about the         came to the department, which was a very big one:    the whole of Asia&#13;
&#13;
role of the general economics department when the resources of the Bank          and the Middle East.    I had previously been deputy to Jeff Rucinski.&#13;
&#13;
were larger than they were in the early '50s, but before we get to that          OLIVER:   Then Asia and the Middle East got split?&#13;
&#13;
kind of an issue, I think we should co on with a discussion of your              STEVENSON: And I was on the South Asia-Middle East end.     It continued&#13;
&#13;
career in the Bank.     We left you being an economic advisor.                   more or less that way. although some of the countries moved back and&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     No, I was never an economic advisor.                              forth.    When I took over. it was simply South Asia: basically India.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I beg your pardon.   Let's straighten that out.                      Pakistan. Nepal. Afghanistan. and Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     In 1952 when the Loan Department was split up into area           OLIVER:    From '52 until sometime in the '60s. you were a loan officer?&#13;
&#13;
departments, I transferred into the Europe, Africa, and Australasia              STEVENSON: From '52 to '59. I was a Division Chief in Western Europe.&#13;
&#13;
Departaent from the economic staff.       I went in as s division chief.         In '59 I moved over to Asia and the Middle East as Assistant Director.&#13;
&#13;
which was s glorified loan officer for a group of countries.         My first    OLIVER:    I take it only the director has the title of loan officer?&#13;

division was Scandinavia. but I quickly got tranâ&#128;¢ferred into Western             STEVENSON:    No. The loan officer is t:he man who negotiates loans.    'l'he&#13;

&#13;
split up into South Asia and the Middle East.       I became Director of         negotiated loans (for projects) and people who did economic analysis of&#13;
&#13;
South Asia after Escott Reid left.        (Geoffrey Wilson had been Director     specific countries.&#13;
&#13;
before him.)     When Hr. Woods came. I was already in South Asia.      It did   OLIVER:    When you were deputy director. you were not a loan officer?&#13;

Vice President today.                                                           OLIVER:   Within a department there would be a number of divisions, such&#13;
&#13;
           There were probably four or five people in each division,            as the India division, run by a division chief who would have an&#13;

perhaps half of them loan officers and half of them economists.        (That    economist or two working for him.       They would have the title of&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     There was no way an economic advisor could appeal to a              Department.   Then Geoffrey Wilson, and then Escott Reid.       I succeeded&#13;

STEVENSON: Yes. he could appeal to a department head. but that very             OLIVER:   About what year did you succeed Escott Reid1&#13;

seldom happened. In fact there were not usually very serious                    STEVENSON: I can't remember exactly.       It was when Woods was there.&#13;
&#13;
differences of opinion.     I think it 1 s rather that the economic advisor,    OLIVER:   So it must have been early in the Woods administration.           It&#13;

by virtue of his position in the department, wasn't in a very strong            waa probably about '63.&#13;

position unless he had a strong position vis-a-vis the director.                STEVENSON: Somewhere in there.&#13;

STEVENSON:     No. he was an advisor to the department head.                    very happy-- as Geoffrey Wilson hadn't been happy.        Mr. Woods did not&#13;

He came as a sort of senior advisor. but be was obviously being brought&#13;

&#13;
STEVENSON: Yes. because he had had a lot of experience in India.                      OLIVER:   But these were not the same people who were the top people in&#13;

STEVENSON: He'd been in the Britiah Treasury.           Yes he had.                   STEVENSON: No.    He knew the various finance ministers -- Morarij Desai&#13;

STEVENSONE As I recall. he left the Bank.                                             bad a somewhat different attitude towards some of the private sector.&#13;

things I said to hill when he told me was. "1 never thought you had                   I say the government, I mean the civil servants at the Ministry of&#13;

would have rather not had us lend to Indian Iron and Steel.             There was   event like that?&#13;
&#13;
one project called Chasnall. in Bengal, which the Bank lentÂ· for and                STEVENSON:     I don't know.   There are leaks in every government. and&#13;
&#13;
which really went very badly.     I wonder if we would have got so far              there are always wheels within wheels.      I don't think most leaks happen&#13;
&#13;
with that if we hadn't felt a pu.h from Woods.                                      by accident.     Incidentally. when you mention part of the Bell report&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was it a project which had been fully authorized, so to speak.            being printed in the press. at least one volume of that report was not&#13;
&#13;
by   the project people in the Bank?                                                published. !! the request of the Indian government. It was a report on&#13;

STEVENSON:     The project people did the analysis.    There vas always some        planning.&#13;

tension between the project people and the area people.          Hr. Woods          OLIVER:     I understand the Bell Report was 14 volumes altogether. one of&#13;
&#13;
liked to exploi.t that -- "constructive tension," I think he called it.             which was a summary volume. and that was the one that got printed.              But&#13;
&#13;
Yes, they authorized and analyzed the project.                                      I am leaping ahead.     I wish you would lead up to the Bell report.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   What caused it to go awry?     Was the economic forecast not              STEVENSON:     At some stage. things were not going well in India.         in&#13;
&#13;
accurate, or was the engineering feasibility off base?                              some ways.     It was clear that all sort of price relationships were out&#13;

STEVENSON:     I think you should read the audit which Operations                   of whack. A lot of people thought that the rupee was overvalued.            Then:&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:   I will seek it out.    At any rate. your suggestion is that Mr.           who the American was.&#13;
&#13;
Woods had some hand in suiding the work that was being done in India                OLIVER:     This was Oliver Franks'l And the second man was7&#13;
&#13;
and. to some extent. the work was not exactly what the Finance Minister             STEVENSON: Herman Abs:     German.   And there was an American.        They had&#13;

OLIVER:      The reason I am interested in the Finance Minister is because          countries as far as financial aid was concerned.        I forget what year&#13;
&#13;
it turned out subsequently that the r'inance Minister (I think it was               that was. but anyway I think Mr. Woods in believing there had to be&#13;
&#13;
the Finance Minister) entered into â&#128;¢n agreement with the Bell Mission               some general high level approach to India (which. I think. everybody&#13;
&#13;
about keeping the Bell Report confidential. and then. aomehaw. the                  agreed with: certainly I can't recall any grave dissent} thought of&#13;

&#13;
sort of background there was in the Indian Finance Ministry for an                  OLIVER:     There was already a consortium I take it7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    17                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:      Yes.   It was in connection with that.      In those days.        it   reported to Woods.      The division chief in charge of India was in a&#13;
&#13;
Western Europe. outside of the U. K. and France to their own former               difficult position and I was in a difficult position.      There were&#13;
&#13;
colonies, did not give much aid in the real sense.           If my memory is      conversations going on between Hr. Woods and Bernie Bell. and. though&#13;
&#13;
right. the thought was that it would be good to mobilize Western                  Bernie would tell us quite a lot. we never quite knew who was doing what&#13;
&#13;
European (particularly German) financial support for India. and if we             or what the whole story was.&#13;
&#13;
had a general mission, this might do it.          There was a lot of discussion   OLIVER:   Who was the division chief at the time?&#13;
&#13;
about Indian economic policies at the time. and some skepticism about             STEVENSON:     Greg Votaw.&#13;
&#13;
some of them.      When we started looking for people. Bernie Bell's name         OLIVER:    You suggested him before as someone I should talk to.        You&#13;
&#13;
turned up.      I think it was first suggested to me that Bell be the chief       also mentioned the name. Peter Wright.       Does he figure in this at this&#13;
&#13;
economist on the mission to be organized, but we were looking for some            time?&#13;
&#13;
prominent figure to head it.                                                      STEVENSON:     He was an economist who had long been concerned with India.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      This was in connection with the Three Wise Hen?                      He wrote most of the economic reports on India at that time.         I forget&#13;
&#13;
Sl~ENSON:       No. this was after that exercise.       I think there was some    whether he bad become economic advisor or chief economist -- not&#13;
&#13;
analogy to it in people's minds.        There were discussions about who the      formally. but he was the economist who had had more experience with&#13;
&#13;
leader would be. but nobody ever came up with anybody. Finally somebody           India than anybody else at the time.&#13;
&#13;
said.   Â·~hy   can't Bernie just do    it?~   He had left the Export-Import       OLIVER:    Did he write reports about other south Asian countries?&#13;
&#13;
Bank.       In a consulting firm. he had done same work for the Bank.             STEVENSON:     Yes. Pakistan.    He later on moved over to Latin America,&#13;
&#13;
and a lot of people knew him.         They thought of him first as the chief      but that is another story.&#13;
&#13;
economist. but he ended up heading the mission.           The man who was the     OLIVKR:    Ia he still in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
chief. if you like. was Hr. Woods.            That is how it evolved that they    S'l'EVENSON:   He has retired.    He is in town.&#13;
&#13;
reported to Woods -- which caused. of course, all sort of problems in             OLIVER:    What happened after the Bell Mission waâ&#128;¢ appointed?&#13;
&#13;
the South Asia Department.                                                        S'l'EVENSON: Well. it went out.     I think Votaw was on the mission.     There&#13;
&#13;
OLIVI::R:      I suppose a reasonable question to ask is how did the South        was a mixture of Bank staff and outside consultants, and they did&#13;
&#13;
Asia Department react to having a separate mission go out to India?               reports on various subjects.       As you said. there were 14 volumes and a&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:      The mission was organized in the South Asia Department, but       summary volume.     As I said earlier, one of the major things which&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                19                                                                             20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
people were concerned about was the exchange rate.     Opinions were. I          OLIVER:   The $900 million figure sounds like a lot to me.    The Bank was&#13;
&#13;
think. divided on what the Bank should or could do about any exchange            pushing at that time for IDA Replenishments in the order of a $1 billion&#13;
&#13;
rate.     Traditionally. and still today. the exchange regime is the             dollars a year and having great trouble getting agreement on that.         So&#13;
&#13;
function of the Fund.     I was not personally involved in the mission.          it was almost like getting two IDA replenishments, one just for India.&#13;
&#13;
Maybe there was somebody from the Fund. 1 1 m not â&#128;¢ure.     You'd have to        STEVENSON:    It was aid from the consortium countries.&#13;
&#13;
look that up.                                                                    OLIVER:   Yes, but they were the main countries of the IDA replenishment&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I've been told that the Fund. through Pierre Paul Schweitzer.        also.&#13;
&#13;
met with Bernie Bell and George Woods. and the question was asked                STEVENSON:   That's right, and in the event the amount was not totally&#13;
&#13;
whether the Fund approved of the mission's saying something about the            found, as I recall.   The Indians made much of this.&#13;
&#13;
exchange rate. and the answer waâ&#128;¢ that the Fund said. "Yes. by all               OLIVER:   I think, to some extent, it was found by countries sayine that&#13;
&#13;
means it should. 11    Schweitzer didn't see how these other matters which       they would give a grace period on the repayment of principal on past&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was directly interested in could be dealt with if nothing was           loans in lieu of putting up additional funds.&#13;
&#13;
said about the exchange rate.                                                    STEVENSON:   I forget that, frankly.     ENerybody was trying to make it&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:    That was the difficulty.   If you were going to have a             look as big as they could without giving more than they thought they&#13;
&#13;
report on the main economic subjects, it would be difficult to make              could.&#13;
&#13;
sense of it without saying something about that.     The question was, of        OLIVER:   I understand.   It left a bad taste.&#13;
&#13;
course, how much to do about it.     If you did discuss it. how much             STEVENSON:   It left a very bad taste.&#13;
&#13;
emphasis could the Bank put upon it?     In the end the negotiation was          OLIVER:   In the Indian government, partly because the $900 million was&#13;
&#13;
going to be a discussion on policy changes and aid.       The discussion in      not found and partly because the devaluation was larger than the Indian&#13;
&#13;
the end, I think, got down to the question of devaluation and aid from           government felt useful.&#13;
&#13;
the consortium: $900 million (Am I right on that?), which,                       STEVENSON:   There was a pretty big argument as to whether the&#13;
&#13;
incidentally,    had to be found -- and. in the event, was not found.       So   devaluation would work in the classical sense.      The elasticity of&#13;
&#13;
many Indians felt that devaluation was forced on them and the full               demand for Indian exports was very low, so, in the shortish term, there&#13;
&#13;
amount of aid promised was not forthcoming.     In the end, the Bank took        was little gain.   The Indians knew that.     There were those who opposed&#13;
&#13;
the heat.                                                                        it, and those who were unhappy about      somebody else forcing it upon&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              21                                                                                 22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
them -- people like I.G. Patel.      You might ask him about it.              India (this was after I was no longer in charge Peter Cargill was in&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              charge) and things had been going badly, Cargill left Delhi.            Woods&#13;
OLIVER:     How did you feel about it. and how did the economists in the&#13;
&#13;
South Asia Department feel about it?                                          was still there.      Woods called the Bankâ&#128;¢s resident representative at&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              the office, asked for Cargill, and was told that he had left.            Woods is&#13;
STEVENSON:    Well, I didn't think we should force it on them. I didn't&#13;
&#13;
think it was something that an international agency could do. To what         reported to have said, ''Even my own side is letting me down."&#13;
&#13;
extent it was forced on India and to what extent the Prime Minister           OLIVER:    Why was Woods there at all?&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              STEVENSON:    I don't know.     I was out of it.   I don't know    which&#13;
accepted it, I don't know; but I just didn't think that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
get into the position it got into, bec&amp;U5e it would reap no advantage         particular visit it was.       On the devaluation issue, my guess is that&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              the Indian dislike was mostly a matter of pride.        Most felt that&#13;
and the Bank got tarred all over the place.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVI::R:   Did the Indian economy, in fact, have considerable difficulty     something was being imposed; it looked that way and they didn't like&#13;
&#13;
after the devaluation occurred?                                               it.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     Well, as I recall exports did not expand as fast as people     OLIVER:    Is there anything more to be said about this episode in your&#13;
&#13;
hoped they might.     Some didn't see !BI substantial gain.   As I said in    life?&#13;
&#13;
the beginning. it was pretty clear. in one way or the other. the              STEVENSON:    As I   ~aid,   I was out of it before it really came to a&#13;
&#13;
exchange rate was out of whack. but no magical recovery occurred.      Some   head.&#13;
&#13;
of us. including me, didn't think there would be any magical recovery,        OLIVER:    You left, so to speak, before the Bell Commission report had&#13;
&#13;
because the Indian economy doesn't react very quickly to anything.      Of    become public1&#13;
&#13;
course it could be said the Indian government did what had to be done         STEVENSON:    No, I left after it had become public, but while it was&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              still subject to negotiation.        I didn't leave actually:     Woods found a&#13;
and that the Bank took the heat. To what extent that is true I don't&#13;
&#13;
know.                                                                         way of getting me out of the line by amalgamating two departments,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I guess this is the time when Hr. Woods, as a person. was not     making me the Associate Director of one, and putting Peter Cargill in&#13;
&#13;
all that popular in India.                                                    charge of India.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     No.                                                            OLIVt:R:   India became a department all by itself?&#13;

                                                                              STEVENSON:    No.    He amalgamated South Asia and East Asia.       It became&#13;
OLIVER:     Do you have any idea how he felt about this1&#13;
&#13;
               Well, I think he knew it.   On one occasion when he was in     bigger again.       I don't think he wanted to make a bigger department: he&#13;
STEVENSON:&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                23                                                                               24&#13;

wanted me out and Cargill in.                                                    what was then East Pakistan.    We had lent for a small industry project&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 in West Pakistan. and we were planning a similar operation in        ~ast&#13;
OLIVER:     So where did you go?&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     I was Associate Director for a little while, kicking my           Pakistan.    Hr. Woods suddenly decided that we shouldn't be involved in&#13;
&#13;
heels, not doing very much, and then I went over to Economics.        I just     small industry. so we had to abandon the project at a rather late&#13;
&#13;
waited for things to cool down.                                                  stage.    Mr. Woods didn't meet with us on that; it was Raymond Cope&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 and Bill Diamond who called us in and told us.       That was the day&#13;
OLIVER:     Sure. Did Cargill himself have some feeling of unhappiness&#13;
&#13;
about Woods' negotiating with the Indian government?                             President Kennedy was shot, which is perhaps the reason I remember it.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON: I wouldnâ&#128;¢t know, but I would suspect that he did.         Peter was   This was after a mission had gone out and had put together a project&#13;
&#13;
very strong willed.     As a matter of fact. that's why Woods felt he was        which had been in our lending program for a long time and which&#13;
&#13;
more suitable than I.     When the Indians came to the Annual Meeting a          everyone in the Bank management knew about. We knew the weaknesses of&#13;
&#13;
few days or weeks after the South and East Asia departments had been             the project better than anybody; it was difficult to get good strong&#13;
&#13;
merged, it was kind of embarrassing all around. I met the Indian                 financial relationships in lending for small industry in Cast Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 We had done the best that we thought possible.       We were prepared to go&#13;
delegation in the corridor, and some of them said, "You are too good a&#13;
&#13;
friend of India." That was what Woods thought, I believe.                        ahead.      The Pakistanis particularly wanted the Bank to do something&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, would you like to say something about other aspects of         for East Pakistan.     (We had done this sort of thing for small industry&#13;
&#13;
your South Asia experience?        We have concentrated heavily on one           in West Pakistan).     Then when we had got half way down the road in East&#13;

&#13;
STEVENSON:     Yes.   Some things might indicate the way Mr. Woods               both to Pakistan politics and to us.&#13;
&#13;
operated.     He did like to get into operations every now and again, but        OLIVER:     What reason did he give?&#13;
&#13;
it was not a very predictable thing.        He sometimes appeared to act on a    STEVENSON:     He said he didn't think the Bank should be in the business&#13;

whim -- in many ways admirable, because he had a lot of very sound&#13;
&#13;
instincts but this made him difficult to work for.                               He also decided at one stage in connection with development banks that&#13;
&#13;
      He had been involved with development banks, as we said before.            we were expending too much effort on loans to small development banks.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 I had the unhappy job of going out to Singapore and telling the&#13;

&#13;
wrong decisions that could ever have been made.     but Hr. Woods just         mission went out and came back. and then Woods decided be didn't want&#13;
&#13;
didn't want to have anything to do with small development banks.       I       to get involved in airlines in Nepal.        He called me up and said. "It&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
staff. or were these relatively rare occasions?                                absolute non-starter.     I went to the India Executive Director and told&#13;

STEVENSON:     Well. of course. one always remembers these things.     I can   him.    He blanched.   He didn't want even to refer it to New Delhi.&#13;

remember getting overruled on another one in connection with Nepal             because he thought it would spoil relations too much.            If   he ever did&#13;
&#13;
which again illustrates Woodsâ&#128;¢ way of managing in a very personal              or did not. I don't know.     The answer was:       "NO.''   That was a case of&#13;
&#13;
way.     We had been looking for some suitable project&amp; in Nepal.    We had    Woods' whimsy.    He woke up that morning and didn't like the idea.              It&#13;

sent out a general mission led by an outside con&amp;ultant.     One of the        just made him uncomfortable. so he wasn't going to do it.&#13;

&#13;
problem. The Bank bad never lent for airlines -- except when it had            STEVENSON:     I think he probably made it in the morning.&#13;

touchy one.     It was one where you wanted to clear every hurdle before       he made less good decisions in the afternoon than in the morning.&#13;
&#13;
you made any mave. which I thought we did.     We cleared it with Burke        STEVENSON:     I couldn't say when he did.     It   was the afternoon when&#13;

Knapp.                                                                         saw him. but exactly what had happened before, I don't know.&#13;

OLIVER:     Was it all right with Mr. Woods?                                           I remember another incident when we were trying to put as much IDA&#13;

&#13;
Pakistani government.     It was very difficult.    We were working on loans   slowness of disbursements -- all of this money tied up and not being&#13;
&#13;
for water supply in Dacca and Chittagong.     Not long after Woods came.       disbursed:     for things like the Dacca water supply project, Woods came&#13;
&#13;
he called me up one day and     said. NWater supply in Dacca1     They can't   to the conclusion that he would do something about that. so he went to&#13;

run an elevator." We had scaled down the project a lot from the                the projects staff and asked them to recommend which loan would be&#13;
&#13;
original proposal.     We thought we had scaled it down enough. but in         cancelled.     Of course there was a terrible argument between the area&#13;
&#13;
fact we had not.     The project went badly. In this case. Woods instinct      and the projects people who proposed to cancel a part of an irrigation&#13;
&#13;
was quite right and the project got scaled down further later. From            loan in East Pakistan.     This was terribly hard for the Pakistani&#13;
&#13;
what I have said. I may have given an unfavorable picture of Hr. Woods.        government. who were mostly West Pakistanis, to put across.               One of my&#13;
&#13;
but he was certainly not always wrong.                                         least fond memories is of having to do that. I finally persuaded Burke&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   East Pakistan must have been one of the most difficult places        Knapp that we would not send a letter. but that Ellsworth Clark.&#13;
&#13;
in the world to have projects go really well.                                  Assistant General Counsel. and I would take the        let~er    to the Pakistani&#13;

STEVENSON:   Oh. it was. but other places were more so. As I told you          Executive Director and let him handle it from there.            If we had sent it&#13;

the other day. one of the problems that the South Asia Department had          to the Ministry. God knows what would have happened.            Woods felt&#13;
&#13;
was in the IDA allocation. There would be a cap on India:        40 percent    somebody had to be    ~aught   a lesson.     He had to be seen by the Board to&#13;
&#13;
or so of the total.     We were judging that. in the next year. IDA would      be doing something about IDA.       He might have been right on that. but it&#13;
&#13;
lend 60 percent of its resources to India and Pakistan. but at the end         sure didn't make relations with the Pakistanis easy.&#13;
&#13;
of each year we would find that the total was more like BOt --not              OLIVER:   No. nor relations with his staff who had spent time working on&#13;
&#13;
because South Asia had introduced new projects. but because others had         the project,&#13;
&#13;
been slower to move.     It was more difficult in Africa. for instance.                  Well. we have about 15 minutes left on the tape.           May we talk&#13;
&#13;
The result of that was that. when credits to India or Pakistan came to         a bit about economics?     You came to the Economics Department at about&#13;
&#13;
the Board. a Director. representing Africa. perhaps. would say. "Look          the time we were talking about:       '06?&#13;
&#13;
80 percent has gone to India and Pakistan again." and we would have to         STEVENSON:     Somewhere about there, yes.      The Economics Department baa&#13;
&#13;
take the heat for that.                                                        been growing rapidly during the Woods' years.         As I was saying at&#13;
&#13;
      As you said, lending is difficult in a place like t:ast Pakistan.        lunch. it had built up a substantial staff.          It came about under Itving&#13;

Friedman, who was at a disadvantage in the Bank. He had come in as an&#13;
&#13;
outsider with a whole habit of life in the Fund and the U. S. Treasury         Bank being what it was and having grown the way it had. it was simply&#13;
&#13;
dealing with exchange restrictions .    I don't know whether the               the wrong recipe. At that point. the relations between the Economics&#13;
&#13;
department was going well or not, but anyway I was asked to come over          Department and the areas departments were not always very good or very&#13;
&#13;
and be Andy Kamarck 1 s assistant or deputy -- I have forgotten which it       close,    It wasn't so much whether they were good or bad. but whether&#13;
&#13;
was called.                                                                    they were close or distant.&#13;
&#13;
          I tried to bring the Economics Department as close as possible       OLIVER:    If the Economics Department does work which seems not to be&#13;
&#13;
to the operating departments, because, as I said earlier, I believed           related to operations -- as some of the work in the Bank at this very&#13;
&#13;
that if the economics work was to have an influence in the Bank, it had        moment seems to be. then I suppose the operating departments will&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               simply say. "This is not of any great use to us ...     1 don't see any&#13;
to be accepted by the area departments.     So, what I tried to do while I&#13;
                                                                               obvious reason why they would mind its being done, however.          It's no&#13;
was there was to improve relations with the area departments, -- for&#13;
&#13;
instance, to get people who were in the Economics Department sent on           worse than having the American Economics Association publish journal&#13;
&#13;
missions with area department people.                                          articles about development.&#13;
&#13;
           The department had grown, I think, a bit too fast.      It had      STEVENSON:     That's right, but when it begins to infringe on&#13;

which was always a will-of-the wisp anyway.&#13;
&#13;
not disposed to look kindly on somebody second guessing them on the            operating departments had been too conservative in their estimates of&#13;
&#13;
                                          That I think was a non-starter       creditworthi ness?     I come back to the proposition that if an economy is&#13;
creditworthi ness of their countries.&#13;
                                                                               growing rapidly. its creditworthi ness is getting better rather than&#13;
from the word go, but I think it had probably come because of Irving's&#13;
                                                                               worse;    its debt can be rising, and it can be becoming more&#13;
coming in from the outside.&#13;

           Well, it may also hsve been related to the request from Hr.         creditworthy at the same time.&#13;

&#13;
            Woods used the analogy of the three legged stool --the Bank            I don t think Mr. McNamara was wrong in trying to increase lending, but&#13;
&#13;
balanced on three legs: the economists. the engineers. and the loan                that he went too far and too fast.&#13;
&#13;
officers.    This. of course. was not a correct analogy, but it did                OLIVER:   This was Woods' objective too, was it not1&#13;
&#13;
express his feeling that he could have an economic advisor who would               STEVENSON:   A bank lends money.&#13;
&#13;
deal with the economy of a country. The arguments in the Economic                  OLIVER:   But while it tries to be just as careful with its IDA lending&#13;
&#13;
Committee when Irving was chairman were furious.       Things got really           as it does with its Bank lending, in a sense it doesn't have to be&#13;
&#13;
quite heated, and it boiled down     to the question of who is responsible         quite as careful -- unless its operations result in a decreased IDA&#13;
&#13;
for this country:     Am I, the Area Department Director, or are you, the          replenishment.   It isn't as though the Bank is going to be unable to&#13;
&#13;
Economic Advisor?                                                                  pay ita own creditors.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     And the loan officer knew he was responsible.                          STEVENSON:   Of course, but the decrease in IDA replenishment did&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:     Well, it was the area department director at that stage.       It   happen.   The U. S. government tried and tried to put a break on&#13;
&#13;
would be the area department director and Friedman arguing who was                 McNamara and finally cut the amount it put up â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
responsible.     I think in the end no line officer could accept being             OLIVER:   Do you think (it's pure speculation) that's primarily because&#13;
&#13;
repeatedly overruled by someone not in a line position.                            the United States felt that loans were being made that were not&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     What happened when McNamara came and the directive went out,           terribly good. on the one hand, or was it because the enthusiasm for&#13;
&#13;
so to speak, that the Bank was going to increase its lending quite                 development had pretty well waned?&#13;
&#13;
substantially?     Presumably, the facts had not changed as to the                 STEVENSON:   Oh, probably both.    I remember once, a long time ago. 1&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness of the countries or the rate at which the projects                had been up to somebody's house with Senator Frank Church and&#13;

&#13;
circumstances, some of the area department people would have been                  administration Democrats and had been extremely supportive of foreign&#13;

     STEVENSON:    Ezcept I remember that Lloyd Reynolds at Yale wrote an           think he ever â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;

&#13;
     only a phase of economic history.     What has disappeared from American       OLIVER:     He was never a deputy director of a department?&#13;
&#13;
     economic education -- one of the formerly compulsory fields that has           S'l'EVENSON:    I don't think so.   I thought the question was,   Hor..~    do you&#13;

     just disappeared -- is economic history.                                       organize.      Nobody, I think, disputed the work on development economics&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER:    I agree with you.   Well, the case could be made that Labor         in particular countries and in general. but I think that when the&#13;
&#13;
     Economics is not really a field, and Public Finance is not really a            economists were separated from the line of operations, it tended to&#13;

     to be concerned with economic theory.     'fhere is Micro- economics, Macro    experience that they might have got to make their work more relevant.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                35                                                                             36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              One division in the Economics Department which felt very         same time.     I didn't think that was a good one for me.    I thought. in&#13;
STEVENSON:&#13;
&#13;
strongly on that score was Domestic Finance. Stanley Please's division.        the end. you're going to have to get out.      There was a fuss in the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               Economics Department ---- this was after Andy Kamarck had left --        when&#13;
which worked extremely well.     It always got ita people on missions.&#13;
&#13;
                                              He wanted and Chenery wanted     Hollis tried to reorganize it again.     Two of us. David Henderson and I.&#13;
When McNamara came. he didn't want that.&#13;
                                                                               both said. "We aren't going any further."      David. the Director of the&#13;
somebody reporting to him.     So the link between Economics and&#13;
&#13;
Operations was further weakened. and the relevance of economic work            Economics Department at that time. hadn't been with the Bank long. and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               he decided to leave.     I had invested too much in the Bank for that.&#13;
became less in my view.&#13;
&#13;
_OLIVER:   Cbenery. to some extent at least. wanted people who were doing      Hollis had offered me another assignment in Economics. and I said, I&#13;
&#13;
the kinds of work that they might have done for him if he had still            didn't want to do it.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        I finally negotiated myself into Iran.    It was just after the&#13;
been at Harvard.&#13;
&#13;
STEVENSON:    I think so.   His major interest was country models in the       first oil crunch, which resulted in an enormous domestic inflation in&#13;
&#13;
same way as Anne Krueger's main interest is trade.      As you say. he         Iran.    I had negotiated my terms with the development bank there in the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               spring intending to go there later in the year.      By the summer prices&#13;
tended to have them work on country models.      Then you get to the&#13;
&#13;
question of whose model is relevant.     Chenery did not get into              had practically doubled on all the things I was going to be buying.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               talked about it to the man I was to be working with.        After looking at&#13;
argument&amp; as much as Friedman did on the economies of particular&#13;
&#13;
countries.    He was reporting to McNamara.    That was what McNamara          houses in Tehran. it was obvious that a tremendous chunk of my salary&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               was going to go on housing.      The manager of the development bank had limits&#13;
wanted. and I would guess that Friedman had a bit of difficulty dealing&#13;
                                                                               to what he could do. because he couldn't make a favorite of an outsider.        So&#13;
with McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVBR:    I understand.    Just to finish the story of your own work at       we. in the end. said. "Look we'd better call it quits before this&#13;
&#13;
the Bank. did you spend the rest of your career in the Bank in                 starts."     So I came back. though I didn't knOW" what I was coming back&#13;

              No.   I was looking for an overseas assignment.    I wanted to   I will retire,â&#128;¢â&#128;¢    When I came back and was asked to come over to EDI,&#13;
