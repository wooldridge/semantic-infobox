ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of the Multi-Donor Umbrella Facility for Capacity Development&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements&#13;
entered into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide&#13;
contributions (the aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to&#13;
be administered by the Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A.    DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.    The objective of the Trust Fund is to scale-up the reach and impact of the World&#13;
Bank Institute's (WBI) strategy and its key areas which focus on capacity development&#13;
and cut across WBI's clusters of services and business lines.&#13;
2.    WBI's approach under its new strategy leverages World Bank's programs by&#13;
catalyzing change for stronger development results through strengthening the capacity of&#13;
government and non-government change agents to collectively solve pressing&#13;
development challenges. WBI's approach has been structured around three interlinked&#13;
clusters that are aligned to the Open Development agenda for the World Bank: (a) Open&#13;
Knowledge; (b) Collaborative Governance; and (c) Innovative Solutions. Under each&#13;
cluster, WBI has developed new business lines, which include but are not limited to:&#13;
(a)   Open Knowledge promotes open, practical and accessible knowledge sharing&#13;
through practitioner knowledge exchanges, e-learning and face-to-face courses.&#13;
i)    Structured Learning.  The e-Institute is the World Bank's virtual&#13;
learning platform. The e-institute leverages innovative advances in&#13;
information and communication technology to deliver high-quality and&#13;
customized learning that can be accessed by development stakeholders.&#13;
ii)   Knowledge Exchange. WBI provides support to client countries and the&#13;
World Bank's operations teams with the tools that facilitate peer-to-peer&#13;
knowledge exchanges among developing countries.&#13;
(b)   Collaborative Governance promotes collaborative leadership and multi-&#13;
stakeholder action for more inclusive and sustainable development results.&#13;
(i)   Government Transparency and Geo-mapping. WBI maps government&#13;
data, including social infrastructures, government's budgets, and IFC,&#13;
MIGA and World Bank project locations.&#13;
(ii)  Non-Governmental Actors' Capacity. WBI works with diverse&#13;
stakeholders such as governments, civil society, media, the private sector,&#13;
and parliaments to strengthen public accountability to help citizens receive&#13;
better services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
(iii)  Citizen Engagement through ICT. WBI works with a variety of&#13;
development stakeholders to promote mechanisms that connect citizens to&#13;
public service providers and policy makers, and that provide feedback on&#13;
the quality of public services and the effectiveness of donor-funded&#13;
programs.&#13;
(iv)  Multi-Stakeholder Governance. WBI facilitates collaboration among&#13;
stakeholders and networks by designing and delivering a structured&#13;
multiyear capacity-building process that fosters a commitment to&#13;
collective innovation and collaborative action for positive change.&#13;
(c)   Innovative Solutions advances new development solutions through innovation&#13;
platforms or competitions.&#13;
(i)   Competitions and Challenges. WBI leverages the global reach of new&#13;
and innovative solutions to key development challenges using&#13;
technologies, tools, methods and online platforms.&#13;
(ii)  WBI Innovation Lab. WBI scales-up innovations across the Bank&#13;
including identifying cutting-edge innovations, developing an "innovation&#13;
portfolio" aligned with World Bank strategic priorities.&#13;
B.    ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES&#13;
The Contributions may be used to finance expenditures that are eligible under the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies, procedures, and under the Administrative Manual.&#13;
