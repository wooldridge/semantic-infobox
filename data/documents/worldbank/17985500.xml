                      Interview with Ernest Stern&#13;
                             The World Bank&#13;
                           December 16, 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm Lou Galambos, from Johns Hopkins University.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's Historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm    Da~id   Milobsky, the Assistant to the Historian.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I'm Ernest Stern, Managing Director of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, we want to go all the way back to the beginning,&#13;
&#13;
and we'd like you to talk a little bit about your family&#13;
&#13;
background, which strikes me as being very interesting.           I&#13;
&#13;
want to start in 1933.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it is reported I was born in that year.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yes.&#13;
A:   Well, there is not very much to tell.       I was born in&#13;
&#13;
Frankfurt, Germany, and I was moved by my parents to&#13;
&#13;
Amsterdam about a year later.       I grew up there until the&#13;
&#13;
Second World War started.       After the Germans occupied the&#13;
&#13;
Netherlands, around 1940, we were picked up by the Germans&#13;
&#13;
and spent some time in a concentration camp.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where was that?       In The Netherlands?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     It was in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Germany?&#13;
A:   Yes.     After the war we returned to Amsterdam, where I&#13;
&#13;
started high school, and in 1947 I left for the States. A&#13;
&#13;
year later the rest of my family joined me.         We lived in&#13;
&#13;
Queens.     I finished high school, and I went to Queens&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 2&#13;
College.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Slow down a minute! To a historian, those are very&#13;
important years.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, yes. To anybody, to anybody.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   They shaped modern society.     Did you not want to talk&#13;
&#13;
about the concentration camp, or are you willing to talk&#13;
&#13;
briefly about your experiences?     We would like to get some&#13;
&#13;
sense of how your personal experiences shaped your view of&#13;
&#13;
the world.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was very young at the time; We don't have to talk&#13;
&#13;
about the content of the experience, but it certainly helped&#13;
&#13;
to shape my attitude. I don't know how much it shaped my&#13;
&#13;
personal values.&#13;
&#13;
     The whole family survived but it certainly shaped my&#13;
&#13;
views towards Germany and the Germans.     It definitely helped&#13;
&#13;
to reinforce the view that very few things are permanent. I&#13;
&#13;
don't take stability for granted.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What did your father do?&#13;
&#13;
A:   He was in the metals trade, in a firm in the&#13;
&#13;
international trade in metals and minerals.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were those things discussed at home?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. Quite a lot.   His business interests certainly&#13;
&#13;
helped create an international outlook on things because the&#13;
&#13;
business was pretty global.     We had quite an interna.tional&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 3&#13;
&#13;
outlook at home.     He was reasonably well read, and had&#13;
&#13;
friends and associates around the world.     Lots of things in&#13;
&#13;
the family shaped my values -- an interest in music, an&#13;
&#13;
interest in reading -- things of that sort.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was your family Orthodox?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Not Orthodox in the Brooklyn sense of black hats and&#13;
&#13;
long sideburns, but they were reasonably observant by German&#13;
&#13;
standards, which was a form of westernized judaism.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You came over by yourself?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In 1947?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. I stayed with my uncle.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Okay.     That's a fairly decisive experience, at your age.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was on the boat for thirteen days.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you get seasick?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     But everybody else did.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You decided that the educational opportunities in the&#13;
&#13;
U.s. would be better?&#13;
A:   I didn't decide that.     That was decided for me.     I was&#13;
&#13;
still a very young fellow in those days. At the age of 14 you&#13;
&#13;
were not actually expected to have opinions - at least in&#13;
&#13;
Europe -     or if you did, they were not supposed to be&#13;
&#13;
determining.&#13;
Q:   So your father was a forceful man?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 4&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     Not particularly. But he and my mother had decided&#13;
&#13;
to move to the States. I think they wanted to give their&#13;
&#13;
children a better future, and educational opportunities were&#13;
&#13;
certainly a part of that.&#13;
&#13;
     I went ahead simply because, as the oldest of three&#13;
&#13;
brothers, I was entering a more critical stage of my&#13;
&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where did you go to school in Amsterdam?&#13;
&#13;
A:   For grammar school, I attended something called the&#13;
&#13;
Dalton School. I had four years of grammar school before the&#13;
&#13;
war interrupted my schooling. After we returned I went to the&#13;
&#13;
Jewish High School for a year.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So a lot of your education took place at home? The war&#13;
&#13;
didn't seem to delay your education much.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, views on that actually differ. I continued to go&#13;
&#13;
to school in the beginning of the German occupation. There&#13;
&#13;
was some private tutoring in English. There was also a little&#13;
&#13;
schooling until we got deported out of Holland.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   However, when you came back, you picked up pretty much&#13;
&#13;
where you would have been if you had stayed.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, everybody did in those days.     The war interrupted&#13;
&#13;
schooling for a lot of people and they, by and large, got&#13;
&#13;
back in their chronological age groups. Most of them managed&#13;
&#13;
to catch up.    The curriculum in the eighth grade is not too&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 5&#13;
complicated, at least it wasn't in 1947.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you have subjects that you particularly liked at&#13;
that point?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I was always good at mathematics.     I hated&#13;
&#13;
penmanship, literature and history.     They weren't very&#13;
&#13;
sharply focused things.   When I came to the States I enrolled&#13;
&#13;
in Technical High School in New York.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where did you live in New York?     In Brooklyn?&#13;
&#13;
A:   In Queens. I went through a technical curriculum which I&#13;
&#13;
found quite congenial.    I was more in touch with the&#13;
&#13;
scientific side of life than the artistic side.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you give us just some feel for what your school&#13;
&#13;
life was like when you first came to the U.S?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, when I first came to New York, one of the young&#13;
&#13;
men in my uncle's neighborhood acted as my introducer to the&#13;
&#13;
school.   The school was very, very welcoming. It was a period&#13;
&#13;
when lots of people were coming from overseas.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you know English then?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, some -- from the private tutoring during the war.&#13;
&#13;
I certainly wasn't fluent in English, but I picked it up&#13;
&#13;
rather quickly.   I came to he U.S. at the end of the calendar&#13;
&#13;
year, so I started school in the January semester, and went&#13;
&#13;
in with my age group. Language was not a handicap. I don't&#13;
&#13;
remember any difficulty in keeping up.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (12/16/94), Page 6&#13;
&#13;
      It was a technical school so I did more math than the&#13;
&#13;
general curriculum.     We had shop (metal and electricity) and&#13;
&#13;
there was more lab work, although it was high school stuff--&#13;
&#13;
chemistry, physics.     Most of the people in the technical&#13;
&#13;
curriculum stream went into the sciences.     I don't think&#13;
&#13;
there's anything very noteworthy otherwise.     We gave our&#13;
&#13;
teachers the usual rough time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Did you work after school?&#13;
&#13;
A:    No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    You had a lot of studying to do?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I worked during summer vacations, but I never worked&#13;
&#13;
after school.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What did you do?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I had a New York career. I started as a dishwasher&#13;
&#13;
in a resort hotel. In subsequent years, I was a bus boy and&#13;
&#13;
then a waiter.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where did you wait tables?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I washed dishes in Lake Placid and after that, I did all&#13;
&#13;
the other jobs in the Catskills. The only time I worked after&#13;
&#13;
school was in graduate school. I bagged groceries in Boston.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You finished high school in four years. What year did you&#13;
&#13;
graduate?&#13;
&#13;
A:    In 1951.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    What was your perception of the United States in those&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 7&#13;
years?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I didn't have any perception of the United States.      I&#13;
&#13;
only had a perception of New York, and only of Queens at&#13;
&#13;
that. Of course it was mind-blowing at the beginning. It's&#13;
&#13;
hard to adjust to a new culture, but that's nothing new.&#13;
&#13;
Senses of humor differ, and American nationalism seemed&#13;
&#13;
stronger than what I had been accustomed to, but, on the&#13;
&#13;
whole, I thought that the U.S. was a great place. It was less&#13;
&#13;
structured. There were lots of opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you like reading newspapers and keeping up with what&#13;
&#13;
was going on at that time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Sure.     We were always politically conscious.   Of course&#13;
&#13;
we read about the Dodgers, but then we also kept abreast of&#13;
&#13;
political events.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The World Bank never caught your attention?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, no.     The World Bank didn't surface until years&#13;
&#13;
later.   Even its very existence was unknown.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, in the heartland of the United States young people&#13;
&#13;
were generally oblivious to international developments in&#13;
&#13;
those years.     You just didn't hear much or talk much.&#13;
&#13;
A:   New York was different. Not only was the city closer to&#13;
&#13;
Europe, but there were also lots of foreigners in New York.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, our European background generated interest in&#13;
&#13;
European events. In fact, my family took a keen interest in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 8&#13;
&#13;
both domestic and European politics. Current events were very&#13;
much a discussion topic in our family.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What year did your family arrive in America?&#13;
A:   1948.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   My friends from New York from those days say that it was&#13;
&#13;
really easy to get around in the city.     Did you go to things&#13;
like museums and art galleries?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, sure.   No, you never had to worry about anything.&#13;
Safety was not an issue back then.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you go to see the Dodgers?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I went to see the Dodgers, but not regularly by any&#13;
&#13;
means.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Great years.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, they were my favorite.     My family was very&#13;
&#13;
democratically-oriented. Pulling for the Dodgers as compared&#13;
&#13;
to the Yankees was just part of the package.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As you were beginning to look for further education,&#13;
what did you think about?   What possibilities were there for&#13;
&#13;
further education?&#13;
A:   Well, it always was a given that I would attend a&#13;
&#13;
university, and New York City was well endowed with public&#13;
&#13;
universities. My brother and I went to Queens College, one of&#13;
&#13;
the city colleges.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You lived at home?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 9&#13;
&#13;
A:   For part of the time.   We had a relatively small&#13;
&#13;
apartment and in due course I moved out into some rented&#13;
&#13;
rooms in the neighborhood.   When we graduated from college,.&#13;
&#13;
it was assumed that we would continue on to graduate school.&#13;
&#13;
Originally I started out in Chemistry, but the compatibility&#13;
&#13;
was limited. I chose Chemistry partly because my father was&#13;
&#13;
in the metals business, and he dearly wanted one of his sons&#13;
&#13;
to get some education which would make them germane to that&#13;
&#13;
business.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Particularly the oldest son.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I was the first of the block, although he tried&#13;
&#13;
with the next one as well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was your father a chemist or scientist?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No, but he dealt with minerals and chemicals. He just&#13;
&#13;
thought that knowing something about that would be helpful to&#13;
&#13;
the firm. Certainly, the basic objective was to join the&#13;
&#13;
firm, but that didn't really work out. I didn't have a very&#13;
&#13;
specific professional addiction.    I flunked the chemistry&#13;
&#13;
course.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Organic?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Actually,   I didn't get to organic.   It was inorganic.&#13;
&#13;
The theory at the time was that some woman was diverting me,&#13;
&#13;
so I took it again, but I ended up with a C. That's when I&#13;
&#13;
knew that my girlfriend wasn't the source of the problem.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Stern (12/16/94), Page 10&#13;
&#13;
        I then switched to Political Science, the escape of all&#13;
&#13;
the incompetents, and I became interested in international&#13;
&#13;
law. That's what led me to the Fletcher School of Law and&#13;
&#13;
Diplomacy, but I actually did Economics there. I came out of&#13;
&#13;
graduate school with a Master's and all the class work for a&#13;
&#13;
Ph.D.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Slow down for a minute.     You are in Political Science&#13;
&#13;
for three years--&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      -- and these are the '50s--&#13;
A:      Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     ---and Dwight Eisenhower, and--&#13;
&#13;
A:      --all those people.    McCarthy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      --and McCarthy, yes, yes.     Did MCarthy have an impact on&#13;
&#13;
you?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, yes.    I was the president of a Reform Party in the&#13;
&#13;
Student Council. I marched in support of free speech.        One of&#13;
&#13;
the profesors at Queens College was under serious attack by&#13;
&#13;
the McCarthiites. Although I was the presidential candidate&#13;
&#13;
for this party, my political career was a short-lived affair.&#13;
&#13;
It was out of character for me. Both in high school and the&#13;
&#13;
university, I was not a student leader in any sense.         I had&#13;
&#13;
friends,       but not a huge circle of them, and I didn't&#13;
&#13;
exercise much political leadership.        I got on the campus&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 11&#13;
&#13;
newspaper incidentally, but my interest was fairly short-&#13;
&#13;
lived. I helped to run this party, but it didn't last long.&#13;
&#13;
At any rate, the McCarthy period left clear-cut impressions,&#13;
&#13;
as it did with everybody who lived during that time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In those years, did you have a peception of what&#13;
&#13;
Columbia was like?&#13;
&#13;
A:   You mean going there instead of Queens?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, that's a possibility.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It cost money. My father had a decent job but we were&#13;
&#13;
far from wealthy.    The war had wiped out whatever savings he&#13;
&#13;
had, and so he was really starting from scratch. Paying for&#13;
&#13;
school was never a possibility until we got to graduate&#13;
&#13;
school, but even there I got a fellowship.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:   My parents were certainly able to afford seeing us&#13;
&#13;
through, but we could not turn down a free education. In&#13;
&#13;
those days, the city universities were high class outfits, so&#13;
&#13;
there wasn't any doubt that we would go there for college.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:   My youngest brother went to NYU, however.     By that time,&#13;
&#13;
things had changed. The financials were different, so he went&#13;
&#13;
to NYU undergraduate and then law school.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you think about the law as a profession? You said&#13;
&#13;
that you had some interest in international law?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 12&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, but that is really more intellectual fun than law.&#13;
&#13;
If you know anything about international law, you know that&#13;
&#13;
it's a different animal; it constructs a law out of basic&#13;
&#13;
principles and pure logic. It was really the international&#13;
&#13;
dimension of it which was fun. That's another reason why I&#13;
&#13;
liked it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there particular teachers that influenced you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, not really.      There were some teachers I liked more&#13;
&#13;
than others but I can't recall their names.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you apply at just one graduate school?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I probably took the precaution of applying to a number&#13;
&#13;
of schools, but the others were fallbacks.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    So you had Fletcher targeted?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You received a fellowship that paid your tuition?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Most of it, I think.      I don't really remember what the&#13;
&#13;
precise situation was. The fellowship probably covered&#13;
&#13;
tuition and not more than that, or maybe it had board thrown&#13;
&#13;
in. I'm not sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you moved to Boston?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.   To Medford.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.   That's a big move.     It's a different place.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, we can agree on that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But I mean very different.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 13&#13;
A:   Well, not really.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Really?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Just another school for you.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It's a very good one.    I didn't see this move as all&#13;
&#13;
that cataclysmic.    I had moved out of our apartment and lived&#13;
&#13;
in rented rooms during the last two years at college.&#13;
&#13;
Deciding to go to graduate school was not a big deal.      All of&#13;
&#13;
us had been pretty independent.     We went away for the&#13;
&#13;
summers.   We certainly didn't cling to mother's skirts. In&#13;
&#13;
September of 1955, I went to graduate school in Boston. It&#13;
&#13;
was fun to be further away.    I stayed in the dorm the first&#13;
&#13;
year, and during the second year I lived in an apartment with&#13;
&#13;
a roommate.    New York wasn't that far away.   You could get on&#13;
&#13;
the train and go home for holidays, so I didn't see this as a&#13;
&#13;
tectonic plate shift.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Your grades had to have been pretty good to get into&#13;
&#13;
gra\iuate school.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I guess they were pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you tell us just a little bit about the graduate&#13;
&#13;
program?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, the Fletcher School specialized in international&#13;
&#13;
affairs, so all of its economics courses were essentially&#13;
&#13;
international-- international trade, international finance.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 14&#13;
&#13;
They had a strong focus on international economics. I took&#13;
&#13;
most of the economics courses.      I did take a couple of&#13;
&#13;
courses in international law, and also a few courses in&#13;
&#13;
international politics.&#13;
&#13;
        Fletcher was a very interesting place in the sense that&#13;
&#13;
it was seen as a Foreign Service training school by&#13;
&#13;
Pakistanis and some other countries, and the school had good&#13;
&#13;
connections with some of those countries. The student body&#13;
&#13;
was quite diverse and it was very small, so there was a lot&#13;
&#13;
of interaction with foreigners from developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      The economics was basically neo-classical with Keynesian&#13;
&#13;
spin?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You enjoyed that?   You liked the economics?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Charles Kindleberger was the leading professor of&#13;
&#13;
economics, so it was very classical. I enjoyed it immensely.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did all Fletcher students take such a heavy dose of&#13;
&#13;
eco~omics?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, no. That was a decision I made.   There were two&#13;
&#13;
batches of people -- the batch which focussed on the&#13;
&#13;
economics side, and the batch which focussed on the diplomacy&#13;
&#13;
side. They did more international law and international&#13;
&#13;
relations. We all did a little bit of both, but I consciously&#13;
&#13;
decided to go the economics route.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 15&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was this a decision you made up-front, or did it&#13;
&#13;
gradually grow on you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was a great floater. The only thing I ever really&#13;
&#13;
wanted to be when I came to the United States was a&#13;
&#13;
locomotive engineer, and that didn't work out. Actually&#13;
&#13;
that's how I ended up in the Technical High School. My&#13;
&#13;
English wasn't good enough to distinguish the difference&#13;
&#13;
between a regular engineer and the driver of a locomotive. I&#13;
&#13;
had no real professional ambitions.     The general thought was&#13;
&#13;
to get the best education you could and then either go into&#13;
&#13;
management,    (training in a corporation) or join the&#13;
&#13;
(government) public service.     In the European tradition,&#13;
&#13;
public service was seen as a high class activity, and even&#13;
&#13;
when I got out of graduate school I hadn't fully realized how&#13;
&#13;
at odds that was with the American perception.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It was.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It was.    It was and it is.   However, it wasn't the&#13;
&#13;
European view of life, so my family deemed public service a&#13;
&#13;
very honorable profession.     That's where I ended up.Â·&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, I did interview with a few multinationals&#13;
&#13;
coming out of graduate school. I also took the Federal&#13;
&#13;
Service Entrance Exam, and without wanting to rush you,&#13;
&#13;
that's what brought me to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did you end up in the Commerce Department?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 16&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, that was very simple.   They offered me a job. I&#13;
&#13;
had taken the Federal Service written exam and the orals. I&#13;
&#13;
passed and in due course the Commerce Department offered me a&#13;
&#13;
position in the International Office of Business Economics,&#13;
&#13;
International Division. Actually in the Balance of Payments&#13;
&#13;
Division.   Again, note the international flavor. I also got&#13;
&#13;
married after graduate   school~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You two had gone together for some time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   We met in college, in English class.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you tell us a little bit about the kind of work you&#13;
&#13;
did at first?&#13;
&#13;
A:    We calculated the quarterly balance of payments of the&#13;
&#13;
United States, and did the analyses that went with it.   I was&#13;
&#13;
the assistant to the division chief and we worked out many&#13;
&#13;
issues but, essentially,, we focussed on the capital accounts&#13;
&#13;
in the balance of payments. Later, I worked on what became&#13;
&#13;
the first geographic breakdown of the balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
with Latin America.   The person I worked for, Walter Lederer,&#13;
&#13;
was a very well-known balance of payments specialist. He was&#13;
&#13;
a very impressive fellow to work with; very enjoyable.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I guess that was the time when the U.S. started to run&#13;
&#13;
up trade deficits?&#13;
A:   Oh, yes.   We spent a lot of time wondering where all the&#13;
&#13;
money had gone, and why the "errors and omissions" entry was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 17&#13;
so large.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   While you were at Commerce,   you went into the Army for&#13;
&#13;
six months. After that, .did you return to Washington?&#13;
&#13;
I returned to Washington and decided that the balance of&#13;
&#13;
payments of the United States, while fascinating for a little&#13;
&#13;
while, was essentially boring.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Before you went into the Army, were you working nine to&#13;
&#13;
five, or was this the kind of job where you had really big&#13;
&#13;
crunches?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I didn't work as hard then as I did later. I was a very&#13;
&#13;
junior guy, so I wasn't expected to produce all that much. I&#13;
&#13;
certainly didn't spend long hours at the office, and I didn't&#13;
&#13;
go in on Saturdays.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Okay.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Continuing, I came back from the Army and concluded that&#13;
&#13;
the balance of payments was really not my life's calling, and&#13;
&#13;
one day at lunch I walked past the AID recruiting office. I&#13;
&#13;
went in and filled out an appliÂ·cation. That's how my career&#13;
&#13;
in development started.   Six months later, I was in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you joined the State Department?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, in those days it was not one and the same.    It was&#13;
&#13;
the ICA, the International Cooperation Administration. It&#13;
&#13;
must have been attached to State, but it was relatively more&#13;
&#13;
independent than AID got to be in its later years. They did&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 18&#13;
&#13;
their own recruitment, so it wasn't the State Department&#13;
&#13;
recruitment then.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You weren't covered by State Department?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.   It wasn't the Foreign Service.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At that point, you are getting ready to go to Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
What was your view of the Administration and our foreign&#13;
&#13;
policy at that point?     Did you have strong views?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I don't think I had any great philosophical or&#13;
&#13;
ideological problems with the Eisenhower administraion, and&#13;
&#13;
that's certainly not why I went to AID. It just seemed like&#13;
&#13;
an exciting, interesting thing to do. I was still&#13;
&#13;
professionally floating.&#13;
&#13;
     However, in Turkey,     my interest in development and&#13;
&#13;
development economics got more serious.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you tell us just a little bit about your first&#13;
&#13;
encounter with Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly.     Those were the days when the United States&#13;
&#13;
was. still very big in Turkey. They had a big military&#13;
&#13;
program, and AID,    (or ICA, as it was then) was the civilian&#13;
&#13;
appendage. Part of its job was to promote development, but it&#13;
&#13;
also financed infrastructure to support strategic objectives.&#13;
&#13;
     The AID (ICA) Mission was a well-run place.       My first&#13;
&#13;
boss was Roger Nelson, who later also joined the Bank for a&#13;
&#13;
couple of years.     I was a junior economist. My second boss&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 19&#13;
&#13;
was Alex Lachmann. He also ended up in the Bank later on. He&#13;
&#13;
was a European and a relevant influence on my professional&#13;
&#13;
development.     Of course, this was the first time I'd been&#13;
&#13;
outside of Europe/United States.     It was very strange. The&#13;
&#13;
living conditions were different. Language was a barrier.&#13;
&#13;
Dealing with government officials, trying to provide economic&#13;
&#13;
advice, formulating analyses of what the U.S. ought to be&#13;
&#13;
doing-- all of these were new and certainly very broadening&#13;
&#13;
experiences.     It was very different from sitting in a&#13;
&#13;
government office in Washington. My wife and I loved&#13;
&#13;
absorbing a new culture. We     took to it like ducks to water.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You had trained in neo-classical economics -- with its&#13;
&#13;
nice mathematical equilibria -- and then you learned&#13;
&#13;
development economics.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What kind of development economics had you learned&#13;
&#13;
before you came to Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Not much.    Not much.   Only what Kindleberger was&#13;
&#13;
teaching, and he had little practical experience in&#13;
&#13;
development economics. Nevertheless, he wrote a well-known&#13;
&#13;
book on it.    During the early Turkey period, I got a lot of&#13;
&#13;
development economics from practical experience.     Later,&#13;
&#13;
Lachmann   and Hollis Chenery appeared on the scene.       They&#13;
&#13;
were very helpful and nurturing.     However, I didn't start off&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 20&#13;
&#13;
Â·with any preconceived theory.   I had read lots of stuff-- the&#13;
&#13;
Arthur Lewises of this world, a lot of the Latin America&#13;
&#13;
protectionists-- but I had not formulated any alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
It was never very clear to me why development economics&#13;
&#13;
completely ignored the neo-classical rules of pricing and&#13;
&#13;
markets. Why wouldn't these concepts be relevant to the&#13;
&#13;
developing countries? That was always an issue floating&#13;
&#13;
around in my mind.&#13;
&#13;
A:   The current paradigm is, essentially, a rediscovery that&#13;
&#13;
some of the rules of normal economic theory apply to&#13;
&#13;
developing countries; that they are not exempt.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But that was not the current theory. Just about all you&#13;
&#13;
learned before you went to Turkey must have stressed things&#13;
&#13;
like capital flows and issues that must have seemed&#13;
&#13;
irrelevant when you were actually in the developing world.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No, on the contrary, we were supposed to generate the&#13;
&#13;
capital flows. There weren't any private foreign capital&#13;
&#13;
flows in those days, only public capital. And the U.S. was by&#13;
&#13;
far the principal source. So work involved a set of&#13;
&#13;
allocation decisions. A lot of work went into trying to&#13;
&#13;
identify sensible projects -- where are the priorities, what&#13;
&#13;
are the impediments to exports, what do you do with the state&#13;
&#13;
enterprises -- questions that Turkey to this day has not&#13;
&#13;
answered fully. For instance, we worked on what became the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 21&#13;
&#13;
biggest steel mill in Turkey. Actually, it was funded by the&#13;
&#13;
Development Loan Fund, a companion agency to ICA.      Getting&#13;
&#13;
external capital to supplement domestic savings was very much&#13;
&#13;
the issue.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     However, in addition,   (once you got capital), you were&#13;
&#13;
learning a lot about what happens in the society.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Sure.   It certainly was an environment which was totally&#13;
&#13;
new.    The role of government in the economy was not something&#13;
&#13;
I had seen before or knew much about.&#13;
&#13;
       That's where I learned my respect for Finance&#13;
&#13;
Ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     What kind of conclusions did you arrive at as you&#13;
&#13;
watched the government function in this way?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I think it was mixed. Many of the government's&#13;
&#13;
initiatives seemed very sensible -- building a new&#13;
&#13;
university, providing agricultural extension services, and&#13;
&#13;
institution building.    For example, in Turkey, I think AID&#13;
&#13;
(ICM left behind an excellent highway administration.&#13;
&#13;
However, there were lots of things that were very, very&#13;
&#13;
inefficient. This was especially evident in Turkey's budget&#13;
&#13;
process. It was very political and the decisions had a&#13;
&#13;
profound impact on the economy. It determined allocations to&#13;
&#13;
productive enterprises - some efficient, many not -- and&#13;
&#13;
supported government monopolies in grain purchases, tobacco&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 22&#13;
&#13;
and other products. Even in those days, the inefficiencies&#13;
&#13;
generated by the extensive government intervention didn't&#13;
&#13;
make any sense.&#13;
&#13;
     However, Turkey's problems didn't turn out to be very&#13;
&#13;
different from those of other developing nations during the&#13;
&#13;
'60s and '70s. I worked with the OECD on the first review of&#13;
&#13;
the Turkish State Enterprises, and I don't think what we said&#13;
&#13;
then was all that different from current critiques of the&#13;
&#13;
Turkish economy, although it was expressed in different&#13;
&#13;
language than we use today. The Turks still have the same&#13;
&#13;
enterprises, they still are losing a lot of money.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So these are problems inherent in the bureaucratic&#13;
&#13;
organization of state-owned enterprises?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   I think so.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But with particular cultural differences?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, sure.    The cultural differences -- in terms of their&#13;
&#13;
attachments to maintaining state-owned enterprises --&#13;
&#13;
happened to be very strong in Turkey, and certainly turned&#13;
&#13;
out to be less strong elsewhere.    However, the true&#13;
&#13;
differences lay in the character of these attachments.     In&#13;
&#13;
India, that lesson came later.     In Turkey, one of the&#13;
&#13;
important features was their strong devotion to Ataturk.&#13;
&#13;
Since he created these enterprises so they were almost part&#13;
&#13;
of the national heritage. That kind of approach was, as it&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 23&#13;
turned out later, even more difficult to.deal with than a&#13;
&#13;
socialist ideology. Thus, although the rationale for going in&#13;
&#13;
a certain direction varied widely among the LDCs, their&#13;
&#13;
economic problems Â·were pretty much the same.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You taught for a time while you were there?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   I taught.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences as a&#13;
&#13;
teacher?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it taught me that I didn't want to be a teacher.&#13;
&#13;
Thi.s was a new university in Turkey.    It was supposed to be a&#13;
&#13;
regional university, and indeed it has become so over time&#13;
&#13;
the Middle East Technical University.     However, when it&#13;
&#13;
started it was very small potatoes, supported by the U.N. and&#13;
&#13;
the Dutch. The Dutch donated a few professors and I&#13;
&#13;
reestablished my Dutch connection there.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was Tinbergen involved in this?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Tinbergen was involved, but he never lived in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
The. person who actually lived there and ran the economics&#13;
&#13;
department was Tinbergenâ&#128;¢s delegate, Dr.Koopman, who invited&#13;
&#13;
me to teach a course on the economy of Turkey.     In those days&#13;
&#13;
there weren't any textbooks on the subject.     It was an&#13;
&#13;
interesting introduction to teaching.     All the kids cheated.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How old were they?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, they must have been 18, 19, something like that.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 24&#13;
&#13;
The literature at Middle East T.U. was limited. There was a&#13;
&#13;
lot of chamber of commerce stuff about various Turkish&#13;
&#13;
industries. The students had never written a term paper in&#13;
&#13;
their life, so when one was assigned they went and copied all&#13;
&#13;
those pamphlets.     It was interesting but I didn't do this for&#13;
&#13;
very long.     It was a parÂ·t-time occupation.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I want to get back to the kind of development problems&#13;
&#13;
that you were dealing with in Turkey. Did you see any missed&#13;
&#13;
opportunities for development? Was there ever a time when you&#13;
&#13;
Â·didn't have the resources to do what you wanted?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, I don't think so.     This was in the early days of&#13;
&#13;
development assistance thinking.     The issue of conditionality&#13;
&#13;
began to emerge but, in what we would consider today as a&#13;
&#13;
very primitive way.     Similarly, other issues in foreign aid&#13;
&#13;
which became common later on, began to be discussed. Hollis&#13;
&#13;
Chenery played a very large role in this. Even during the&#13;
&#13;
early AID period, Chenery emphasized the importance of having&#13;
&#13;
a country strategy; development priorities had to be&#13;
&#13;
articulated; the importance of the macro-economic framework&#13;
&#13;
began to be emphasized as well as of a policy dialogue with&#13;
&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
     I've forgotten how this matched with the Eisenhower&#13;
&#13;
Administration, but certainly by the time ICA became AID&#13;
&#13;
under the Kennedy Administration, those thoughts were there&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (12/16/94), Page 25&#13;
&#13;
and were being developed. Development economics began to play&#13;
&#13;
a major role in development assistance planning.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did you interact with the Turks at this point?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Certainly.   Mr. Karaosmanoglu.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      He was in the Planning Commission?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I knew him even before the Planning Commission was&#13;
&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      A lot of Americans that went overseas in those years&#13;
&#13;
experienced enormous frustrations when they encountered other&#13;
&#13;
societies with different values and different views.       Did&#13;
&#13;
you?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I wasn't really an American so--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      -- so you were well equipped for this.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I have no doubt that my European background helped in&#13;
&#13;
that regard.     And my wife, a born New Yorker, took to it just&#13;
&#13;
as easily.     I don't know what conclusions you can derive from&#13;
&#13;
this.&#13;
Q:      It must be New York.&#13;
&#13;
A:      It must be New York.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      At about this point, you decided to finish your Ph.D.&#13;
&#13;
Was that while you were in Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Can you tell us about this decision?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I have a tendency to finish what I start. I'd taken the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (12/16/94), Page 26&#13;
&#13;
course work and I tho.ught it would be kind of a waste not to&#13;
&#13;
finish the degree.      I had, in fact, started on a Ph.D.&#13;
&#13;
dissertation while I was still in the States, in the Commerce&#13;
&#13;
Department, but I went to Turkey and I had to put it aside.&#13;
&#13;
It was going to deal with the economic philosophy of the&#13;
&#13;
Latin America protectionists. Since Turkey had no source&#13;
&#13;
material on Latin America in those days, I shifted to the&#13;
&#13;
economy of Turkey. That was fortuitous because none of the&#13;
&#13;
professors at Fletcher had much knowledge of Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, every dissertation has to have some addition to&#13;
&#13;
knowledge. Did you have any theoretical conclusion by that&#13;
&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   This was applied economic development as seen in&#13;
&#13;
Turkey. I honestly don't think I added anything to the sum of&#13;
&#13;
human knowledge, but it was unfinished business.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now you are going to have another turn in your career.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Right. I went from Turkey where we had been for five&#13;
&#13;
years, to the AID offices in Washington, where I was assigned&#13;
&#13;
to the. Pakistan Desk.     I stayed there until John Lewis, a&#13;
&#13;
well-known development economist, found me.      He was being&#13;
&#13;
sent out to India as Director of the AID Mission and somebody&#13;
&#13;
had told him about me. He     aske~me   if I wanted to be his&#13;
&#13;
assistant director in the AID Mission in New Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      This was while you were on the Pakistan Desk?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 27&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you tell us a little bit about the difference&#13;
&#13;
between India's problems and those you had encountered in&#13;
&#13;
Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it was a little different scale.    India was, and&#13;
&#13;
still is, a fantastic country, with very diverse culture. I&#13;
&#13;
was comfortable in Turkey because it was practically&#13;
&#13;
European. We were close to Greece, and, in the other&#13;
&#13;
direction, Lebanon. It was an area that was culturally&#13;
&#13;
familiar. India, on the other hand, was a totally different&#13;
&#13;
world. The people were different, and you had to deal with&#13;
&#13;
them very differently.    Their relationship with the United&#13;
&#13;
States was also very different.    Turkey was a close ally of&#13;
&#13;
the United States, but heavily dependent financially on the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. during my time there.    Certainly that wasn't true in&#13;
&#13;
India.    They had a very different view of the United States,&#13;
&#13;
and it was not always benign or even friendly.&#13;
&#13;
     Consequently, the AID Mission in India was a much&#13;
&#13;
smaller player in a much larger pond.    It was fascinating&#13;
&#13;
because the ambassador was Chester Bowles, who was a great&#13;
&#13;
friend of India and had a wide range of contacts.    John Lewis&#13;
&#13;
was similarly well-acculturated. So the AID Mission and its&#13;
&#13;
staff in Delhi had good relationships.    Nevertheless, we&#13;
&#13;
clearly didn't play the kind of role that the AID Mission&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 28&#13;
&#13;
played in Turkey in terms of influencing policy makers and&#13;
&#13;
advisers to government.   The money flow wasn't large enough&#13;
&#13;
for us to play that role. The great drought of 1966, changed&#13;
&#13;
all this, however. The large shipments of food grains from&#13;
&#13;
the Unit.ed States under President Johnson and Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture Orville Freeman, and the conditions attached to&#13;
&#13;
them, created grave tensions with India. By that time, the&#13;
&#13;
conditionality concept had blossomed in development&#13;
&#13;
assistance, and U.S. food aid was used to get India to&#13;
&#13;
liberate its internal grain trade and to let food grain&#13;
&#13;
prices reflect market demand. This made agriculture more&#13;
&#13;
profitable for the farmers. The Embassy and the AID Mission&#13;
&#13;
were deeply involved with this issue. It was a very tense&#13;
&#13;
period, but the drought and the grain shipments did create a&#13;
&#13;
bigger role for AID in India's development.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Just about the time you are headed toward India and then&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan, Rostowâ&#128;¢s "take-off" theory is bursting on the&#13;
&#13;
national scene.&#13;
&#13;
A:   You are quite right. That was the time of "take-off",&#13;
&#13;
but I don't honestly believe that most of the practitioners&#13;
&#13;
thought much of that theory. If memory serves, it just kind&#13;
&#13;
of dangled there. it really never became a serious theory in&#13;
&#13;
economics.&#13;
&#13;
     Certainly this was a great period of intellectual&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94) , Page 29&#13;
ferment.     Rostow's "take-off" theory was the rationale behind&#13;
&#13;
the creation of the Peace Corps. The "take-off" concept came&#13;
&#13;
up during the grain crisis. A number of people suggested that&#13;
&#13;
the solution to the Indians' grain problem was to ship 4,000&#13;
&#13;
Indiana farmers to India in order to teach the Indians how to&#13;
&#13;
farm.     It was an intellectually buoyant atmosphere -- a very&#13;
&#13;
interventionist atmosphere. People thought they had solutions&#13;
&#13;
to development issues. They felt that if they could make some&#13;
&#13;
marginal adjustments - generally based on their own domestic&#13;
&#13;
experiences - in some key areas, rapid growth could be&#13;
&#13;
started and poverty exterminated. That kind of thinking&#13;
&#13;
certainly infused our activities in Delhi. Ambassador Bowles&#13;
&#13;
was also a great believer in this upbeat view of life.&#13;
&#13;
        Together with the devaluation of the Indian rupee, the&#13;
&#13;
grain crisis marked the beginning of an effort at a more&#13;
&#13;
interventionist approach to development finance in India.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Well, it was also a period where people started to&#13;
&#13;
become very irritated with India.     They had been very&#13;
&#13;
admiring before. India was a model of sorts, but gradually&#13;
&#13;
they grew impatient. They wondered how long the development&#13;
&#13;
process would take.&#13;
&#13;
A:      There was certainly lots of admiration and applause even&#13;
&#13;
in those days for the Mahalinobas theory of resource&#13;
&#13;
allocation.     But, although not as well articulated as today&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 30&#13;
&#13;
in terms of markets, there were already arguments against the&#13;
&#13;
Indian system on efficiency grounds and out of concern for&#13;
&#13;
the misallocation of resources.   The planning and&#13;
&#13;
administrative allocation systems were too detailed and too&#13;
&#13;
subject to corruption. The objective of the exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
devaluation was to stimulate export growth and make the&#13;
&#13;
economy more price-responsive,&#13;
&#13;
     AID pursued the same objectives in agriculture. It&#13;
&#13;
wanted a more remunerative price to farmers instead of having&#13;
&#13;
the government syphon off the benefits of surplus production&#13;
&#13;
from the Punjab and elsewhere through low prices for&#13;
&#13;
mandatory government procurement, and use the proceeds to&#13;
&#13;
support inefficient industrial enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
     Twenty years later, many of these issues and debates had&#13;
&#13;
evolved into the current more market-oriented, private sector&#13;
&#13;
based paradigm. But I wanted to emphasize that these general&#13;
&#13;
themes were not unique to AID/Delhi nor invented by us. We&#13;
&#13;
were implementers, not makers of policy. These trends were&#13;
&#13;
worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did the Bell mission affect your work?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, to some extent.   John Lewis handled the&#13;
&#13;
devaluation part very confidentially. It wasn't "our baby,"&#13;
&#13;
but they did consult and work with him. The Bell mission laid&#13;
&#13;
out a blueprint of the things that ought to be happening in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 31&#13;
&#13;
India.    It was the most articulated kind of reformÂ·program&#13;
&#13;
that existed at the time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And on the agricultural side, could you talk just a&#13;
&#13;
little bit about the kinds of programs you were trying to&#13;
&#13;
implement?&#13;
&#13;
A:   There were approximately half a dozen U.S. land grant&#13;
&#13;
colleges which had been twinned with an Indian State&#13;
&#13;
university.   The objective was to improve agricultural&#13;
&#13;
education, extension and agricultural research. The extension&#13;
&#13;
and research function got a lot of support from AID. AID also&#13;
&#13;
financed farm-to-market roads, major irrigation systems, and&#13;
&#13;
the provision of inputs such as seed and fertilizer. I would&#13;
&#13;
guess that agriculture was probably half of our Indian&#13;
&#13;
portfolio in those days. This period was also the beginning&#13;
&#13;
of the "green revolution" that spread to the subcontinent and&#13;
&#13;
the rest of the world - new seed varieties developed in&#13;
&#13;
international agricultural research centers.&#13;
&#13;
     I traveled to many of our agricultural projects because&#13;
&#13;
I was very interested in the direct practical impact,&#13;
&#13;
although I was primarily responsible for the macro economic&#13;
&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
     In short, we were trying to create a more commercially-&#13;
&#13;
oriented agriculture.   After the drought, India didn't go&#13;
&#13;
back to price controls, but it was still a long time before&#13;
&amp;#12;                                    Stern (12/16/94), Page 32&#13;
&#13;
they really liberalized the internal market. We sought to&#13;
&#13;
establish commercially-based seed companies, but their&#13;
acceptance took many years.&#13;
&#13;
     In agriculture, India saw the importance of&#13;
&#13;
liberalization and appropriate farm prices for the farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, that approach did not carry over into industry&#13;
&#13;
for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In Turkey you had been strictly as a professional&#13;
&#13;
economist.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, in Delhi you had more managerial responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was responsible for the economic analysis staff, the&#13;
&#13;
budget, and the allocation of aid. I helped to set the&#13;
&#13;
priorities for our work in India.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But the nature of your job had changed from what you had&#13;
&#13;
done in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This may have also been due to the fact that John Lewis&#13;
&#13;
wasn't very interested in the management side, I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
A:   In Turkey, I became known as a good practical economist.&#13;
&#13;
Chenery discovered me there and wanted me to come back to&#13;
&#13;
Washington to work for him. He was AID's chief economist (an&#13;
&#13;
Assistant Administrator) at that time. A battle ensued&#13;
&#13;
between Chenery and Bill Gaud, the Assistant Administrator&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (12/16/94), Page 33&#13;
&#13;
for East and South Asia, over who would retain my services.&#13;
&#13;
Chenery argued that I would be better off with the academics&#13;
&#13;
on his team than with Gaud's operational staff. Whenever you&#13;
&#13;
have two giants arguing about your services, it doesn't hurt&#13;
&#13;
your career.       Anyhow, I ended up with Bill Gaud, which was my&#13;
&#13;
choice.       Again, I turned away from the academic side of work.&#13;
&#13;
In Washington, I developed as a pretty good manager. John&#13;
&#13;
picked me out because he had heard about me from Dave Bell&#13;
&#13;
(the AID Administrator) and Hollis Chenery. It was certainly&#13;
&#13;
a step up in management responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Something must have happened in your life at this point,&#13;
&#13;
because your self-presentation is of a person drifting&#13;
&#13;
through life.&#13;
&#13;
A:    That's how it went.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    All of a sudden, between Turkey and India, you are&#13;
&#13;
becoming very successful and you have big men fighting over&#13;
&#13;
you. I'm baffled.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Did you ever see that movie, "Being There?"&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Well, there you are.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I see.     So there was an epiphany.   You had a&#13;
&#13;
transformation.&#13;
&#13;
A:     No, I don't think I had a transformation.      I don't have&#13;
&#13;
a    very deterministic view of history, especially my personal&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 34&#13;
&#13;
history.   I think I'm a reasonably bright guy and a&#13;
&#13;
reasonably good manager, and a reasonably good thinker.      I&#13;
&#13;
get to the heart of issues quickly.     I'm a good analyst, not&#13;
&#13;
theoretically but practically.   I think I can judge what is&#13;
&#13;
feasible. And so I moved along in my profession and got&#13;
&#13;
increasingly responsible assignments. I don't think there is&#13;
&#13;
anything unusual about that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And you pick people well?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I try to, but in my Turkey days, I didn't get to&#13;
&#13;
do much people-picking.   My career was helped by the fact&#13;
&#13;
that Chenery came along, as I have already noted. He liked&#13;
&#13;
Turkey. He had previous connections with Turkey, and he found&#13;
&#13;
me there working with some good people, and doing the kind of&#13;
&#13;
analysis he thought useful. I was also helped by the fact&#13;
&#13;
that when the Peace Corps was established, Washington asked&#13;
&#13;
all the AID Missions for their submissions. Ours was the&#13;
&#13;
first seen in Washington and it was one of the few which&#13;
&#13;
thought the Peace Corps a very useful idea. Our response, for&#13;
&#13;
which I had been responsible, laid out how such an&#13;
&#13;
organization could be useful in Turkey, and what it might&#13;
&#13;
focus on. This was not obvious since what the Peace Corps&#13;
&#13;
volunteers could effectively do in a country was not very&#13;
&#13;
clear at the outset. And Chenery was very involved in AID's&#13;
&#13;
response to the Peace Corps proposal.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 35&#13;
&#13;
     All those things caught Chenery's attention. Chenery and&#13;
&#13;
I got to know each other and we got along well. Chenery&#13;
&#13;
thought that his economic staff would benefit by having a&#13;
&#13;
practical transaction-oriented person who understood what the&#13;
&#13;
economists are talking about.&#13;
&#13;
     But I also did a good job on the Pakistan desk and&#13;
&#13;
received an internal award from AID. I was promoted fairly&#13;
&#13;
rapidly.     There wasn't any epiphany between the Pakistan Desk&#13;
&#13;
and India.     It was more of a gradual evolution.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You had a positive slope.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, there was a positive slope.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I want to stop just a minute on the agriculture in&#13;
&#13;
India.     Did you see yourself as trying to replicate the&#13;
&#13;
American experience with Indian agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Absolutely.    That was the model. But when you say "you",&#13;
&#13;
I assume you mean me in my AID incarnation. I was in Delhi&#13;
&#13;
less than two years. The U.S. land grant colleges were there&#13;
&#13;
before I came and after I left.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you wanted to connect the demonstration-educational&#13;
&#13;
side with the market side.     Is that correct?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.     But in retrospect, we failed to do what we did&#13;
&#13;
later at the Bank: reform the agricultural extension services&#13;
&#13;
thoroughly and assure a more market-based, productivity-&#13;
&#13;
oriented set of incentives.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 36&#13;
&#13;
     We certainly tried to introduce the American land grant&#13;
&#13;
college approach to teach the farmers extension methods.&#13;
&#13;
However, we didn't realize that the Indian concept of an&#13;
&#13;
extension service was very different from the American view&#13;
&#13;
of an extension service.   The extension agent really was a&#13;
&#13;
village level worker responsible for a wide range of actions&#13;
&#13;
including social services. He in fact spent little time&#13;
&#13;
disseminating practical agricultural know-how.&#13;
&#13;
     Not only were farmers reluctant to adopt new methods,&#13;
&#13;
but the Ag universities failed to link research and extension&#13;
&#13;
adequately and assure effective dissemination of research&#13;
&#13;
results. There probably was too much faith in a natural link&#13;
&#13;
between agricultural research and farmers' problems in India;&#13;
&#13;
in fact, research priorities were not well focussed;&#13;
&#13;
practical farm problems did not get the priority they should&#13;
&#13;
have and prestige research was too often identified with&#13;
&#13;
problems of the advanced countries. There was inadequate&#13;
&#13;
connection to the practical realities of India. We didn't&#13;
&#13;
really focus on that issue until much later, and that was a&#13;
&#13;
mistake. It was a failure to fully understand the local&#13;
&#13;
structure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did the Indians offer any advice on this problem?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, the Indians had a long history of extension&#13;
&#13;
workers, and these people gradually took on more and more&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern. (12/16/94), Page 37&#13;
tasks as the Indian government's view of development became&#13;
&#13;
more complex. As a result, they were unable to deliver much&#13;
&#13;
practical advice. The beginning of a fundamental reform came&#13;
&#13;
in 1975. By that time, I was in the Bank. The Bank sent Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Benor to one of the states of India, where he persuaded the&#13;
&#13;
Government to reform the extension service. He took the&#13;
&#13;
village level workers and said, "Tomorrow morning, you will&#13;
&#13;
be extension agents, period." Using the same staff, little&#13;
&#13;
money and much improved management, he developed a highly-&#13;
&#13;
motivated group of workers and effective dissemination of&#13;
&#13;
technology. Things began to click. Major increases in yield&#13;
&#13;
were achieved and the system gradually was extended&#13;
&#13;
nationwide. During the same period, there was a great build-&#13;
&#13;
up of technical capacity in India. Indian agriculture&#13;
&#13;
improved tremendously.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That, in a curious way, duplicates the American&#13;
&#13;
experience. The   u.s.   built a great extension service, but it&#13;
&#13;
didn't begin to pay off for decades. Okay. From India, you go&#13;
&#13;
to the Pakistan AID Mission in Lahore.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. I regretted making that move.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Maybe you could explain that a little bit more.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It was a promotion.      I went there as the Deputy Mission&#13;
&#13;
Director, having been the Assistant Director under John&#13;
&#13;
Lewis. There was more responsibility, but India was a much&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 38&#13;
&#13;
more exciting place.   Delhi was a much more exciting place&#13;
&#13;
than Lahore. The culture was much more interesting.     Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
was quite conservatively Islamic. The parties were terrible.&#13;
&#13;
All the women on one side, all the men on the other side --&#13;
&#13;
just like American parties, for that matter.&#13;
&#13;
     There were few cultural activities. Music, painting and&#13;
&#13;
the arts didn't flourish in Lahore. It was a fairly small&#13;
&#13;
town, despite its reputation.   Every Indian you meet today,&#13;
&#13;
in Delhi, says "Oh, I was born in Lahore, it's wonderful,"&#13;
&#13;
but that's because they all remember a different Lahore from&#13;
&#13;
a long time ago.&#13;
&#13;
     The work was interesting and, again, lots of people who&#13;
&#13;
have stayed with me through my career were there at the time.&#13;
&#13;
Mahbub Ul-Haq was in the Planning Commission.    Parvez Hasan,&#13;
&#13;
who is now Res Rep in Uzbekistan was the head of the West&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan Planning Commission.   Nurul Islam was in East&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan.   The U.S. had a program in Pakistan which enjoyed&#13;
&#13;
more support from the United States.    It was more like&#13;
&#13;
Turkey, although the alliance wasn't as close.    Pakistan was&#13;
&#13;
a major recipient of military as well as economic assistance.&#13;
&#13;
The AID Mission was by far the largest donor.&#13;
&#13;
     Â·I was responsible for pretty much everything that went&#13;
&#13;
on in the mission. Obviously, the contact points with the&#13;
&#13;
government were at a higher level than they had been in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 39&#13;
&#13;
Delhi.   Professionally it was a less interesting time&#13;
&#13;
because, although there was more money relative to India on&#13;
&#13;
the AID side, the influence on the government was less&#13;
&#13;
because our relationships were so heavily influenced by the&#13;
&#13;
military alliance.     There wasn't much conditionality that was&#13;
&#13;
feasible.&#13;
&#13;
     Again, we did a lot in agriculture. Irrigation,&#13;
&#13;
desalinization,   dam construction. We helped introduce high&#13;
&#13;
grade rice into West Pakistan.     Agriculture was a large part&#13;
&#13;
of our portfolio, but there was also a lot of balance of&#13;
&#13;
payments assistance. In retrospect, I don't think we did much&#13;
&#13;
in the social sectors, or in infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You said that your contacts are now coming at a higher&#13;
&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, as Deputy Director my contacts were both directly&#13;
&#13;
with Ministers as well as the senior civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.   Right.   Did you learn any political lessons?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I learned about the importance of political channels.        I&#13;
&#13;
remember once going to Mr. M. M. Ahmed (Chairman of the&#13;
&#13;
Planning Commission) to convey Washington's concern about the&#13;
&#13;
high level of Pakistan's defense expenditures. I dutifully&#13;
&#13;
delivered the message and made some reference to the fact&#13;
&#13;
that perhaps the next program loan couldn't be consummated if&#13;
&#13;
they didn't do something about it.     He got very annoyed.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 40&#13;
Q:   And he let you know he was annoyed?&#13;
&#13;
A:   He certainly did let me know.   He knew more about&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan's relations with the United States than I did.      That&#13;
&#13;
was clear in very short order.   Â·we quickly dropped the&#13;
&#13;
matter, and he got his money.&#13;
&#13;
     It taught me also that USAID cannot be relied upon to&#13;
&#13;
stick with economic conditions in countries where the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
has strategic interests. Sooner or later, USAID is going to&#13;
&#13;
get rolled. It was a lesson I took with me to the Bank, where&#13;
&#13;
we worked closely with the US from time to time in countries&#13;
&#13;
of strategic US interests.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wanted to ask about your relationship to the whole&#13;
&#13;
military operation that was going on.   Was it much bigger&#13;
&#13;
than USAID?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we never had much contact.   In Turkey, there was a&#13;
&#13;
whole separate establishment, the Joint U.S. Military&#13;
&#13;
Advisory Team (or something). It was a large assistance&#13;
&#13;
operation run by a General. We rarely saw them. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
there were US Air Force bases. The Advisory Group was part of&#13;
&#13;
the Country Team, so -- once a week, -- the General would&#13;
&#13;
show up at the ambassador's senior management meeting.&#13;
&#13;
A:   In India, there was no American military presence; in&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan, there was a small operational group but nothing&#13;
&#13;
like the involvement in Turkey, which was a full NATO ally. I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 41&#13;
&#13;
never had any direct dealings with the U.S. military. There&#13;
&#13;
were some installations on the northwest frontier but that&#13;
&#13;
was mostly intelligence stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were your ties with the rest of the State&#13;
&#13;
Department's. operations there?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, we held each other in respectable and mutual&#13;
&#13;
disdain.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Not a great deal of communication?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The people on the development side thought of the State&#13;
&#13;
Department like all good red-blooded Americans think of the&#13;
&#13;
State Department. It was unfair to be sure, but, development&#13;
&#13;
and foreign policy objectives do not mesh easily. They never&#13;
&#13;
understood the Indian problem. On the development side, even&#13;
&#13;
though it was the U.S. Government, one tended to behave more&#13;
&#13;
like one tends to behave in the World Bank. The country&#13;
&#13;
became your client.   You weren't really selling American&#13;
&#13;
national security objectives or commercial objectives, but&#13;
&#13;
were trying to provide sound advice and effective programs.&#13;
&#13;
That ambivalence, those tensions exist in all bilateral aid&#13;
&#13;
programs.   You frequently find yourself in conflict with the&#13;
&#13;
State Department and their political objectives. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
there were other conflicts - for instance the P.L.-480&#13;
&#13;
program, the food grains sales, were not always need-tested,&#13;
&#13;
reflecting U.S.-commercial interests, but undermining the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 42&#13;
&#13;
price incentives for domestic producers. And    there were more&#13;
&#13;
petty conflicts or conflicts of style. The AID Missions were&#13;
&#13;
always very much larger and the staffs less disciplined, many&#13;
&#13;
coming from universities and the private sector. The State&#13;
&#13;
Department personnel followed the rules better.    Whenever we&#13;
&#13;
tried to develop a joint common service, such as    a motor&#13;
&#13;
pool, the effort usually failed because they lived by the&#13;
&#13;
rules and our guys tended to hop in a car whenever they&#13;
&#13;
thought it necessary to visit a project or find out what&#13;
&#13;
problems we could assist with.&#13;
&#13;
     You didn't exactly have compatible people and most of&#13;
&#13;
the AID people were (except for that bureaucratic core like&#13;
&#13;
myself)   technicians from the private sector and the&#13;
&#13;
universities. They basically thought that all the official&#13;
&#13;
stuff was nonsense.   So there wasn't a close association.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You viewed agricultural problems at the village level.&#13;
&#13;
Did the State Department people have sympathy for what you&#13;
&#13;
were trying to do?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, some. But many did not see this type of activity as&#13;
&#13;
germane to the "big picture" they were concerned with. It was&#13;
&#13;
always viewed with a touch of disdain. But this was not too&#13;
&#13;
different from the views of the national senior civil&#13;
&#13;
servants. Our people went into "the bush", the village level,&#13;
&#13;
more often than the local civil servants. Our staff was more&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 43&#13;
&#13;
people-oriented; that's what development was all about. The&#13;
&#13;
national civil service staff weren't so service-oriented.&#13;
&#13;
They had seen poverty for umpteen generations and they didn't&#13;
&#13;
think this was going to get fixed tomorrow.      Many had a&#13;
&#13;
different set of motivations and a different sense of&#13;
&#13;
urgency.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.     Right.   When you were in Pakistan, did the war&#13;
&#13;
in Vietnam begin to impinge in any way on your attitudes?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     This had already been a source of considerable&#13;
&#13;
strain with the Indians. The economic side of the Vietnam war&#13;
&#13;
began to drain resources and budgets, of course.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That was the only way?      It really didn't affect the&#13;
&#13;
relations?&#13;
&#13;
A:   In Pakistan, No, it didn't.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, then you make another one of those strange jumps&#13;
&#13;
where you are not working hard, just drifting through life,&#13;
&#13;
and suddenly becoming more successful.&#13;
&#13;
A:   A very natural life it was - although to be clear, I&#13;
&#13;
didn't claim that I didn't work hard.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This is the Pearson Commission.      Now, what happened?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It was just an interregnum.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did that happen?      Did Hollis push you into the&#13;
&#13;
Pearson Commission ?&#13;
&#13;
A:   How did I end up in the Pearson Commission?      Oh, I don't&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 44&#13;
&#13;
know how I ended up in the Pearson Commission.        They were&#13;
&#13;
looking for people, I guess.     No, I know, I know how I ended&#13;
&#13;
up in the Pearson Commission.     Ed Hamilton recruited me.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He what?&#13;
&#13;
A:   He recruited me. The Pearson Commission was set up by&#13;
&#13;
Bob McNamara at the World Bank. He knew Ed Hamilton from his&#13;
&#13;
time at the Defense Department, I believe. Ed Hamilton was&#13;
&#13;
the international side of the Budget Bureau at the time and&#13;
&#13;
he was appointed Executive Secretary of the Commission. Ed&#13;
&#13;
asked me to be his Deputy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you know him before?&#13;
&#13;
A:   A little.     I knew his wife better, but she wasn't his&#13;
&#13;
wife then.     Ed and I had met briefly during budget&#13;
&#13;
discussions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He asked around to get clearance on you?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I suppose.     And then we recruited the rest of the staff.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In terms of your career, how did you look on this?           This&#13;
&#13;
was an interesting move, because it was off at an angle.&#13;
&#13;
A:   That's how I looked at it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It's not a straight line now.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     Not everything is linear in the world.     I don't&#13;
&#13;
know, really. Ed came to see me; I was back from Pakistan but&#13;
&#13;
I didn't have anything specifically lined up; and the&#13;
&#13;
objective - providing a better articulated justification for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Stern (12/16/94), Page 45&#13;
foreign assistance I thought was an important objective. So I&#13;
decided to go do it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     He came to see you in Pakistan?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No.     I was back in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Back in Washington? Can you quickly describe how the&#13;
&#13;
Pearson Commission developed?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It was very interesting because of how it was staffed.&#13;
&#13;
The Commissioners had been picked by Mr. Pearson, together&#13;
&#13;
with Mr. McNamara.       Ed Hamilton had a free hand, as to the&#13;
&#13;
staffing,      he was very aggressive, in collecting a high&#13;
&#13;
caliber staff at very short notice. We had all kinds of&#13;
&#13;
notables. Goran Ohlin, a well-known economist, joined; Don&#13;
&#13;
Brash who now is the Governor of the Central Bank of New&#13;
&#13;
Zealand, and Ravi Gulhati, a World Bank staff member.        (The&#13;
&#13;
rest of the names are readily available).&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You had a lot of Bank staff on the Commission, didn't&#13;
&#13;
you?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Some.    As a rough guess, maybe half were Bank staff and&#13;
&#13;
half were recruited from the outside.        Carlos Diaz was from&#13;
&#13;
the outside; but since I had had no serious contact with the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank at that point I wasn't struck so much by the&#13;
&#13;
institutional affiliation of people as by their professional&#13;
&#13;
capacity.&#13;
&#13;
       Anyhow, Ed had a clear idea (McNamara's idea) of how&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 46&#13;
&#13;
these problems were going to get solved. Ed had no&#13;
&#13;
professional experience in development, and he was not an&#13;
&#13;
economist, so he was doubly handicapped.     Lester Pearson was&#13;
&#13;
doing this as a kind of public duty. Barbara Ward was very&#13;
&#13;
influential in having McNamara set up a Commission to give a&#13;
&#13;
boost to foreign assistance for development. It was clear&#13;
&#13;
that the objective was a high class sales job that should&#13;
&#13;
result in higher levels of aid.&#13;
&#13;
     The Commission itself had very eminent people.     Arthur&#13;
&#13;
Lewis,   (a well-known economist), Douglas Dillon, Wilfried&#13;
&#13;
Guth. The caliber of people was very high.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I think you are running in pretty high company now.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I was only a staff member. However, the Commission&#13;
&#13;
blew up somewhere after its third or fourth meeting. We had&#13;
&#13;
been producing the technical chapters. I did the one on the&#13;
&#13;
aid flows to South Asia.    They went all right, but then Ed&#13;
&#13;
Hamilton decided one day to produce the first draft of the&#13;
&#13;
Commission Report, and     that's when things exploded. Most of&#13;
&#13;
the staff decided to resign. It was very U.S. centered,&#13;
&#13;
focussed on US strategic interests and arguments. But this&#13;
&#13;
was a very international commission and a very international&#13;
&#13;
and independently minded staff.&#13;
&#13;
     Well, we made peace, eventually but then, even with&#13;
&#13;
that, the paper was--&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 47&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Hold it. What was your role in the peace process?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I helped a little, but I was also a little tainted&#13;
&#13;
because I was the Deputy Secretary and an American. We&#13;
&#13;
finally agreed that Ed would take a little break and give the&#13;
&#13;
staff a chance to produce a new draft. It was more a&#13;
&#13;
participatory effort. That was the draft that went to the&#13;
&#13;
Commission. However, the Commission also developed a serious&#13;
&#13;
rift at the end. At one meeting, Arthur Lewis went to his&#13;
&#13;
room and refused to come out again. I worked quite a lot at&#13;
&#13;
bridging these differences. The problem was basically that&#13;
&#13;
some of the members of the Commission still felt that some of&#13;
&#13;
the paper's recommendations, and some of its arguments, were&#13;
&#13;
too US and US security oriented.   The Chairman of course&#13;
&#13;
pushed hard for a concensus.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   These were ideological problems, I assume.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Correct.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And the ideological clash was over--?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it really was about how hard-nosed, how&#13;
&#13;
conditional donors were going to be; whether a specific aid&#13;
&#13;
target (0.7% of GNP) should be endorsed; how much weight to&#13;
&#13;
give to the political/strategic arguments for aid as compared&#13;
&#13;
to humanitarian and economic. Ed and McNamara, were on the&#13;
&#13;
hard-nosed side, others had a much more nuanced approach. I&#13;
&#13;
don't think that the fundamental objectives were very&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (12/16/94), Page 48&#13;
&#13;
different, but they were not inclined to express themselves&#13;
&#13;
as imperially as the US view was wont to be cast, nor to see&#13;
&#13;
the issues as much from the cold war and U.S. power&#13;
&#13;
perspective.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where would you place yourself at that time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, I was always a pragmatist.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You wanted a draft that was acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly. This was a high profile Commission.      It could&#13;
&#13;
hardly be allowed to fail without doing serious damage to&#13;
&#13;
development .. So, to have a draft which can be agreed on is&#13;
&#13;
important. And these were essentially likeminded people so&#13;
&#13;
the arguments about principle, often were arguments about&#13;
&#13;
words caused by different cultural or professional&#13;
&#13;
perspectives.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The report was also something that was fairly closely&#13;
&#13;
attuned to McNamara's views?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Absolutely.     It was very clear that this report was&#13;
&#13;
intended to be a rationale for higher aid levels -- an&#13;
&#13;
endorsement of the 0.7 percent of GNP target. That was his&#13;
&#13;
objective.     That's why the Commission was formed.   I don't&#13;
&#13;
think there was any question about that.     However, the&#13;
&#13;
underpinnings for that kind of argument were supposed to be&#13;
&#13;
"Look at development, look at what's been happening. Does it&#13;
&#13;
make sense? Doesn't it make sense? Where ought it to go and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Stern (12/16/94), Page 49&#13;
&#13;
what would they spend the money on if you could persuade them&#13;
&#13;
to spend it?"&#13;
&#13;
     But surely the objective was very much to lay out the&#13;
&#13;
framework which would justify higher aid levels.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you have any interactions with McNamara at that&#13;
point?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   None at all?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, he may have showed up at the office or at a&#13;
&#13;
farewell party but I didn't really meet McNamara until I came&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did you get any sense of his interactions with other&#13;
&#13;
members of the Commission?&#13;
&#13;
A:   He never showed up at the offices or at Commission&#13;
&#13;
meetings. As far as I know, he left it completely alone.&#13;
&#13;
After he set it up, and the Commissioners had been chosen, he&#13;
&#13;
said, "This is an independent Commission." We never saw him&#13;
&#13;
after that. I don't know if Hamilton or Pearson privately&#13;
&#13;
shared drafts with him. That's possible, but certainly there&#13;
&#13;
never was any sign of McNamara intervening with the&#13;
&#13;
conclusions, recommendations or the writing of anything.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did McNamara know Hamilton?&#13;
&#13;
A:   He must have.   Well, I don't know.   I assume he must&#13;
&#13;
have because he picked him.   Certainly Lester Pearson didn't&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (12/16/94), Page 50&#13;
&#13;
know him.    It may have simply been on the recommendations&#13;
&#13;
from people that McNamara knew. He knew a lot of people in&#13;
&#13;
the Administration, and it may have been people who knew&#13;
&#13;
Hamilton from the Bureau of the Budget. He wasn't all that&#13;
&#13;
senior, but he was seen as a rising star.    It may very well&#13;
&#13;
be that McNamara didn't know him personally, or at least not&#13;
&#13;
very well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there parts of the report that you influenced&#13;
&#13;
greatly?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh, yes, several.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you be willing to tell us a little bit about that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The final report really represented a joint effort.        As&#13;
&#13;
I said, I was the principal author of the chapter on aid&#13;
&#13;
flows and on South Asia.   I worked a lot with Carlos Diaz on&#13;
&#13;
the Latin American section. I also worked on the trade&#13;
&#13;
section but Ohlin did a lot of the macro perspective. If you&#13;
&#13;
know Ohlin, he's really a very broad overview guy. Did I push&#13;
&#13;
in any particular ideological direction?    No.   We all knew&#13;
&#13;
what the objective was -- to discuss what aid had&#13;
&#13;
accomplished and what it could accomplish if there were more&#13;
&#13;
of it. That was the structure and we tried to write something&#13;
&#13;
which was reasonably persuasive without getting too American&#13;
&#13;
about it. Part of the conflict (both at the staff and the&#13;
&#13;
Commission level) was about how American this product would&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (12/16/94), Page 51&#13;
&#13;
be. I think that influenced a lot of the arguments. This was&#13;
&#13;
in the days when Europe and Japan were just beginning major&#13;
&#13;
aid programs. This was the basic conflict and Hamilton&#13;
&#13;
certainly exacerbated it.      He had the U.S. audience and the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. public very much in mind, whereas the rest of the group&#13;
&#13;
thought more globally.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did Pearson play a very strong role as the chairman?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   He was a moderator type of chairman.   He certainly&#13;
&#13;
didn't get into details very much, although he was a strong&#13;
&#13;
supporter of assistance to developing countries. But his&#13;
&#13;
perspective was the international political aspects.      He had&#13;
&#13;
an assistant whose name I forget, who was also on the staff.&#13;
&#13;
He later became a Canadian ambassador. When things got a&#13;
&#13;
little tense, he tried to get Pearson to play a more&#13;
&#13;
substantive role in the writing.      Pearson did a little bit of&#13;
&#13;
that.     However, like in most such commissions, most of the&#13;
&#13;
work was done by the staff. None of the commissioners did&#13;
&#13;
very much writing. Their role was to provide the political&#13;
&#13;
perspective.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      This is a good place for us to break?   We'll continue&#13;
&#13;
next time.&#13;

            On December 16 and 29, 1994, and January
            5, 1995, Ernest Stern was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske,
            Louis Galambos, and David Milobsky. During his tenure at the
            World Bank from 1968 to 1995, Mr. Stern worked in the
            following areas: for the Pearson commission as deputy to the
            executive secretary and staff director (1968-1972); in the
            office of the vice president as senior advisor for
            development policy (1972-1974) and as director (1974-1975);
            as vice president in the South Asia regional office
            (1975-1978) and in operations (1978-1980); as senior vice
            president in operations (1980-1987) and in finance
            (1987-1991); as a member of the policy committee (1987-1991)
            and as managing director (1991-1995). He helped supervise
            the preparation of the landmark first World Development
            Report in 1977. He discusses at length the United States
            International Cooperation Administration (ICA) and its
            subsequent change to the Agency for International
            Development (AID). His transcript also concerns the budget
            office, the staff association, and congressional approval.
