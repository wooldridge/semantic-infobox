The undersigned member of the Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the&#13;
Articles of Agreement of International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits this&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association grant to the&#13;
Republic of Rwanda a credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 67,700,000. The purpose of said credit is&#13;
to support the Government of Rwanda's efforts to enhance effectiveness, and expand the coverage of the&#13;
Social protection system.&#13;
1.     The member of the Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a&#13;
credit and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The member of the Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds&#13;
of such credit are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of&#13;
said Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the economic development of&#13;
the Republic of Rwanda and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of&#13;
Rwanda.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the member of the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance&#13;
from the Association, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
