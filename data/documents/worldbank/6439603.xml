Managing Karachi's Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Services&#13;
Lessons from a Workshop&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Background&#13;
&#13;
 Water services in Pakistan's major cities and urban centers remain fragmented and intermittent--no city&#13;
 currently has 24 hours of water supply for seven days a week.This impairs the ability of cities to support&#13;
 economic growth and meet basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Faced by this challenge, the Nazim of the City District Government of Karachi (CDGK) suggested in mid-2004&#13;
 that the Water and Sanitation Program Â­ South Asia (WSP-SA) help to arrange a discussion about lessons for&#13;
 Karachi from Water &amp; Sanitation (W&amp;S) services reform in large cities and urban areas elsewhere in the world.&#13;
 In follow up discussions, it was agreed that although Karachi would be the entry point, the workshop should&#13;
 also include discussion of similar challenges elsewhere in Pakistan. Key W&amp;S stakeholders from major cities&#13;
 in Pakistan, the central government and the provincial government of Sindh (where Karachi is located)&#13;
 attended a two-day workshop in Karachi on February 23-24, 2005. WSP-SA facilitated participation by several&#13;
 resource persons, including practitioners from Manila, Johannesburg, Phnom Penh and from the national&#13;
 water utility in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The formal presentations and delegates' inputs all emphasized the institutional--rather than technical--&#13;
 nature of the challenges around water and sanitation in Pakistani cities. This message also came through in a&#13;
 number of keynote addresses:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 THE GOVERNOR OF SINDH, DR. ISHRAT-UL-IBAD, highlighted the impact of W&amp;S on quality of life and&#13;
 combating deaths and diseases across the world. It is crucial to find ways to use scarce resources properly,&#13;
 which requires innovation, efficiency, partnership with the private sector and international institutions and&#13;
 accountable arrangements. The challenge, he said, is one of enduring institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 IN A PRESENTATION READ BY MR. TARIQ HASSAN, NAIB WAZIM, CDGK, ON BEHALF OF THE NAZIM OF&#13;
 KARACHI, MR. NIAMTULLAH KHAN, it was explained that as the city continues to grow, service demands will&#13;
 grow.The vast service expansion needed requires major financial skills, finance and new management&#13;
 experiences. Devolution provides a favorable context, but there are still many issues at stake. KW&amp;SB is a&#13;
 key delivery mechanism that can provide lessons for other utilities as well create efficient, accountable and&#13;
 self-reliant service providers and authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 THE HEAD OF THE WORLD BANK IN PAKISTAN, MR. JOHN WALL, said that W&amp;S is crucial to poverty&#13;
 reduction and intractably linked to education, health and other services. He pointed out that Pakistan is&#13;
 booming, GDP is growing, and economic indicators are improving. But basic services need to improve, and&#13;
 the challenges are primarily about `getting organized' for this. In his view, people are willing to pay for these&#13;
 services, but they want value for money.The key thing right now is to change the way the city is governed&#13;
 and to ensure better cooperation between key public institutions on land and services management.There is&#13;
 `fiscal space' as revenue has become more available. But it is necessary to work `smarter', and this workshop&#13;
 is about that primarily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 MS. CATHERINE J. REVELS,THE REGIONAL TEAM LEADER OF THE WSP SOUTH ASIA, said that the key&#13;
 issues are institutional arrangements and incentive frameworks. While every context is different, all issues&#13;
 are not unique.The workshop provides an opportunity to learn from different experiences and different&#13;
 approaches to assist Karachi and others define and take forward reform agendas.&#13;

 accountability. Phnom Penh has&#13;
 also used the private sector in&#13;
 some areas, but pragmatically&#13;
 where management needs&#13;
 required that, rather than as a&#13;
 matter of principle. The point is that&#13;
 these different institutional models&#13;
 can be used either on their own or&#13;
 in combination. For example,&#13;
 although private sector&#13;
 involvement is still quite&#13;
 controversial in Pakistan, the&#13;
 international experience shows&#13;
 that the involvement of the private&#13;
 sector was mostly not an&#13;
 ideological choice, but a strategic&#13;
 one.The private sector does not&#13;
 always offer a solution, but private&#13;
 operators may add useful&#13;
 innovation. The more critical issue&#13;
 is keeping policymaking, regulation&#13;
 and provision separate, and&#13;
 therefore ensuring a robust&#13;
 accountability framework.&#13;

            Managing Karachi's water supply and
            sanitation services : lessons from a workshop
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water services in Pakistan's major
            cities and urban centers remain fragmented and
            intermittent-no city currently has 24 hours of water supply
            for seven days a week. This impairs the ability of cities to
            support economic growth and meet basic needs. Faced by this
            challenge, the Nazim of the City District Government of
            Karachi (CDGK) suggested in mid-2004 that the Water and
            Sanitation Program - South Asia (WSP-SA) help to arrange a
            discussion about lessons for Karachi from Water and
            Sanitation (W&amp;S) services reform in large cities and
            urban areas elsewhere in the world. In follow up
            discussions, it was agreed that although Karachi would be
            the entry point, the workshop should also include discussion
            of similar challenges elsewhere in Pakistan. Key W&amp;S
            stakeholders from major cities in Pakistan, the central
            government and the provincial government of Sindh (where
            Karachi is located) attended a two-day workshop in Karachi
            on February 23-24, 2005. The WSP-SA facilitated
            participation by several resource persons, including
            practitioners from Manila, Johannesburg, Phnom Penh and from
            the national water utility in Uganda. The formal
            presentations and delegates' inputs all emphasized the
            institutional-rather than technical- nature of the
            challenges around water and sanitation in Pakistani cities.
            This message also came through in a number of keynote
            addresses. A key lesson learned from the workshop is that
            there is no single solution or model for water management
            that can be applied everywhere. However, international and
            Pakistani city experiences all highlight a number of factors
            crucial for effective reform in most contexts. These factors
            include the importance of reliable information; the need for
            performance benchmarks and monitoring; the issue of keeping
            policymaking, regulation, and provision separate and
            therefore ensuring a robust accountability framework;
            strong political leadership,; having a comprehensive plan;
            sticking to the principles, while being pragmatic in
            strategy; managing change processes; proving powerful
            incentives; and the need to have resources to sustain reform
            plans and initiatives.
