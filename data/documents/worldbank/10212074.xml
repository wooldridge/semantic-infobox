         Global Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (TF092328)&#13;
&#13;
                     Release of Second Tranche -Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
                                Tranche Release Document&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.        This Tranche Release document informs the Executive Directors that the&#13;
Government of Djibouti (Government) has met all technical conditions as stipulated&#13;
under Schedule 1, Section 2 (c) of the Grant Agreement (TF092328) dated June 5, 2008&#13;
for the Global Food Crisis Response DevelopmentPolicy Grant for release of the second&#13;
tranche. The objective of the Grant is to help the Government of Djibouti in reducing&#13;
hunger, preventing an increase in poverty and social unrest, and ensuring the fiscal&#13;
stability needed to foster medium-term social and economic development. The supported&#13;
policy measures are a tax exemption on basic food items, expansion of food aid, social&#13;
assistance and related programs.&#13;
&#13;
2.        On May 29, 2008 the Board approved the Global Food Crisis Response&#13;
Development Program of US$5 million. The first tranche was disbursed upon&#13;
effectiveness and was linked to the tax exemptions on basic food items. The second&#13;
tranche is conditioned on (i) satisfactory progress achieved by the Recipient in carrying&#13;
out the program, (ii) the maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic policy&#13;
framework, and (iii) the presentation of an action plan, which guides the improvement of&#13;
direct support to the most vulnerablehouseholds.&#13;
&#13;
3.        The conditions for the release of the second tranche were met as follows:&#13;
&#13;
            As confirmed by the supervision missions which took place in September and&#13;
            November 2008 as well as by annex 1 of the action plan submitted on&#13;
            December 17, 2008, the authorities have implemented or enrolled all elements&#13;
            of the food crisis urgency program as indicated in their Letter of Development&#13;
            Policy of May 21,2008. In particular, all key measures included in the policy&#13;
            matrix were implemented (tax elimination, preparation of action plan).&#13;
            Further, the government continues to work with the country team on the&#13;
            improvement of targeting mechanisms for social assistance.&#13;
&#13;
            Djibouti's economy was affected by the global imbalances on commodity and&#13;
            financial markets. Recent data to appraise the situation is not available.&#13;
            However, the authorities entered an IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and&#13;
            Growth Facility in October 2008 and agreed on a debt re-scheduling&#13;
            arrangement with the Paris Club creditors soon thereafter. Overall, the country&#13;
            is broadly in compliance with the IMF program as well as with the medium&#13;
            macro-economic framework as specified in the grant document. As confirmed&#13;
            by the IMF staff in an e-mail exchange on January 13, 2009, there does not&#13;
            seem to be any immediatethread to macro-economic stability.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The authorities submitted an action plan for food security and direct social&#13;
assistance on December 17, 2008. This plan includes several elements which&#13;
aim at improving the targeting of social assistance to the most vulnerable&#13;
households such as improving information systems (census, household&#13;
surveys, update of poverty maps and poverty profiles). Moreover the&#13;
authorities intend to study the feasibility of a reform of their social safety net&#13;
and plan, to this end, study tours and workshops. In the meantime, workfare&#13;
programs aim at increasing the revenue of the population in the poorest&#13;
neighborhoods.&#13;
