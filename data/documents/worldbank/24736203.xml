ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   HSBC BANK PLC., represented by its Group General Manager, Global Head of Capital&#13;
Financing and headquartered at 8 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5HQ, Uni Ed&#13;
Kingdom ("HSBC" as an Advisory Partner); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI lli] T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, U /, :he&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE: CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylva ii:i&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, Di 2: 433,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank GroLIp")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter 1:0 nal&#13;
Organizations (1Os), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir gi the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to Ex: and&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economit ;0 wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need present:. a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on e4 ting&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coo c in ited&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize private sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an:1 t s is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investrr  r&#13;
(D) Governments, development inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in.E A ;t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand c i !, in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s:und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em:? g' nce&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range a :i late&#13;
investors that actively partic pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil :i: iefit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and know :1: 3 to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  infrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  institutic 1  )uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global InfrastructurE Fi ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"&gt;. The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera;ii 1; the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruci.j E Nith&#13;
the  participation  of private  infrastructure  investors, coalescing  around  project prel En: ion,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard, I E GIF&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supporte( :, the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep. it a iell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces :i: the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro p( tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I no age&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular c, I irge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interes;ted in collaborating in developing the Global InfrastructurE -0 :ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;

Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collal c ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and vi-&#13;
other potential partners until tie GIF is formally established. The final version of these objE C:i)S&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing t  : IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establishing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure p Icm ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati :i,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia ;r&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex public-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer:. a&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru,::u&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF -aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ir . on&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th A le&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemei t c uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowrstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemer t.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term. by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure:&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GI - can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long t i&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilE :&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to operate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE d L )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities tl E I ill&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thosE&#13;

(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to t e:;&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tE c- cal&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul :i :: !ral&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greatEr&#13;
leverage and ad(ress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resot.rces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t i&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p  - n! rs&#13;

(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove'eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wE 11 z&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara i(&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin1&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; z n:1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, witt advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The cornpo! iiic of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop( se: to&#13;
comprise representatives of F:unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing DirE : k&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili ):E&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve :a:&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wi ra&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;

established for this purpose (Ihe GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu 1:ti )n&#13;
as a coordinating body as prc:jects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo\ :&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in( i,i,: jal&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme l:&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Compos :i: of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and govei n *r nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follov i&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Inpact-projects that support the development goals of the GI&#13;
partner institutiors;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-pro ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities a io:&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-projects that require multiple parties to come together to providl!&#13;
structuring, arrarging and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl :!I of&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial i: lity,&#13;
leverage public fuLnds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s.i: I&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's service delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastructure investments that have global public good characteristi s ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior of&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnet v&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with aw&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot or&#13;
funding mechanisms. During ':he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac ini is,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr :!r ig;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arranging and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi l;&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-i-cluding in particular the management of environmental and 31t il&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri ie 1. e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements D&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc ot ar&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for Gl:&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
