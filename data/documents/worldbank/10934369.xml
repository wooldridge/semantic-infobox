The Governance, Regulation and Finance Division of The World Bank Institute (WBIGF)&#13;
conducted a core course on Competition Policy in Washington, D.C., from December 13-18,&#13;
1998. This was the first training course offered by the Division on competition policy. The&#13;
primary objective of the course was to improve participants' understanding of and problem-&#13;
solving skills for competition policy measures that affect enterprise behavior and market&#13;
structure. The course targeted competition policy practitioners from developing and transition&#13;
economies, particularly economists and lawyers, who have been involved in the&#13;
implementation and enforcement of competition law and policy. The intensive, 5-day course&#13;
was divided into five topics: overview and policy towards cartels; market definition and policy&#13;
towards horizontal mergers; policy towards market dominance and abuse of dominance;&#13;
competition advocacy; and design and implementation options. The daily course work&#13;
consisted of a combination of three major activities: lecture presentations in the morning;&#13;
case studies and small group exercises in the afternoon; and a general wrap-up discussion&#13;
at the end of each day. In the wrap-up discussion, participants shared experiences in their&#13;
respective countries as a way of enhancing participation in the course. Fifty-two participants&#13;
attended the course from 21 countries, including 15 women (28.8%).&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit conducted a course evaluation using two methods. First, a Level I&#13;
end-of-course feedback questionnaire was used to assess the extent to which participants&#13;
were satisfied with course content and delivery. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from&#13;
1=minimum to 5=maximum was used. Respondents' open-ended comments about the&#13;
course were also recorded in the questionnaire. Forty-nine out of the 52 participants (94.2%)&#13;
completed the end-of-course questionnaire, including 12 women (24.5%). Second, a Level II&#13;
(participants' learning) evaluation was conducted using pre/post knowledge tests. The&#13;
pre/post tests consisted of a total of 12 multiple-choice questions, each on a specific&#13;
subject. The pre-test was administered during the course introduction at the start of the&#13;
training course, and the post-test was given at the end of all sessions on the last day. Each&#13;
participant was assigned an "evaluation code number" at the beginning of the course and&#13;
asked to write it down on both his/her pre- and post-test forms. The number served to link&#13;
participants' pre- and post- responses while maintaining anonymity. There were 44&#13;
respondents (89.8%) whose code numbers were matched between pre- and post-tests, and&#13;
their results were used to assess whether there was a significant change in respondents'&#13;
knowledge before and after the course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Respondents' Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents were primarily from the public sector (N=36 or 73.5%), representing&#13;
        national, state, provincial or municipal-level governments. Eight respondents (16.3%)&#13;
        represented private enterprises, and 5 (10.2%) were from either research institutions&#13;
        or other organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  As the course had intended, participants who attended the course worked primarily in&#13;
        the field of economics and/or law. About 61% of all respondents (N=30) reported&#13;
        having worked in both the economics and law areas, while the remaining respondents&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     worked only in either the economics (N=11, or 22%) or law area (N=8, or 16%). A&#13;
     detailed breakdown of experience by year showed that respondents' years of work&#13;
     experience varied significantly: 21 respondents (42.9%) had at least 10 years of&#13;
     experience in either economics or law, 13 (26.5%) had 5-9 years, and 15 (30.6%) had&#13;
     less than 5 years of work in either one of the two areas. There were 5 respondents&#13;
     (10.2%) who had less than 1 year of experience in both fields.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Content and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 4.45 out of 5.0. About&#13;
     94% of respondents rated either 4 or 5 on this indicator, suggesting that a large&#13;
     majority of respondents were highly satisfied with the course's design and delivery in&#13;
     general. Respondents identified the quality of lectures made by prominent experts in&#13;
     the area of competition as the most useful part of the course. In their written&#13;
     comments, respondents particularly appreciated the instructors' practical approaches&#13;
     to dealing with real life problems. Among the course's highest ratings given by&#13;
     respondents were the extent to which instructors were knowledgeable on the issues&#13;
     (mean=4.82), and the course's relevance to respondents' current work (mean=4.53).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  On the course's instructional design, respondents found both lectures (mean=4.24)&#13;
     and case studies (mean=4.02) useful. However, many respondents pointed out&#13;
     possible weaknesses in the current method of case studies and related small group&#13;
     activities. When asked about the areas in which the course would require&#13;
     improvement in the future, more than half of the respondents (N=27) reported that&#13;
     case studies should be improved in the following ways: First, instructors should&#13;
     ensure a more balanced grouping of participants for small group activities. Two issues&#13;
     raised in this regard were: i) some groups could not have a meaningful exchange of&#13;
     views because of the unbalanced numbers of economists and lawyers in a team; and&#13;
     ii) work situations, as well as the level of familiarity with the issues, among the&#13;
     participants in some groups were too diverse to allow for useful debate. Second,&#13;
     instructors should try to make reference to as many examples and experiences as&#13;
     possible from different countries or regions for comparison, when presenting a case&#13;
     study of a particular country. Respondents noted that learning about instructors' own&#13;
     approach to problems and their critique of the case studies would also be extremely&#13;
     useful. Third, respondents felt that more case studies should be presented during the&#13;
     course, and that more time should be spent on case studies, as opposed to theories&#13;
     and basic principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  Respondents' comments also highlighted two key aspects of course delivery: timing&#13;
     of distribution of reading materials; and balance between the amount of materials&#13;
     covered and time availability. A number of respondents requested all reading materials&#13;
     be distributed in advance, particularly to prepare themselves better for case studies&#13;
     and related small group work activities (N=12). The course organizer is encouraged to&#13;
     take this point into consideration for future course offerings, particularly since many&#13;
     respondents in this course expressed that varying levels of knowledge and experience&#13;
     among participants often made small group activities difficult. By ensuring sufficient&#13;
     time for participants to digest the cases, participants can be more familiar with the&#13;
     issues before coming to the session, and small group discussions and exercises can&#13;
     be facilitated more effectively. Regarding the other aspect of course delivery, many&#13;
     respondents felt that the course covered too much material within a short period of&#13;
     time (N=12). Respondents' comments included the point that the group wrap-up&#13;
     session in the evening was sometimes not as productive as they had hoped, as the&#13;
     daily course work schedule was intensive and participants felt fatigued by the end of&#13;
     the day. It was also pointed out that each instructor should respect the time allocated&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      for his or her presentation and try to finish the material within the allotment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Results of Pre/Post Knowledge Tests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Pre/post cognitive tests of 44 matched respondents showed that the respondents&#13;
      scored, on average, 41.7% correct on the pre-test, and 61.2% correct on the post-&#13;
      test. This was an increase of 19.5 percentage points in the respondents' test score&#13;
      average. A paired sample Student's T-test was conducted to see if the difference&#13;
      between the two test scores was statistically significant. The result indicated that&#13;
      there was a significant difference between the pre- and post-test scores (t=5.77,&#13;
      p&lt;.001), suggesting that the respondents, in fact, did better on the knowledge test&#13;
      after the course. It is also worth noting that this is the first course in WBIGF that has&#13;
      successfully measured learning gain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  How well respondents performed on specific subjects varied across the questions.&#13;
      Among the 12 questions on the pre-test, for example, Q6 ("exploitative business&#13;
      practices") was answered correctly by only 4 out of the 44 matched respondents&#13;
      (9.1%). This question was the lowest scored item of all pre-test questions. Among the&#13;
      highest scored items on the pre-test were Q11 ("elimination of unnatural monopolies")&#13;
      and Q12 ("practical measures to enhance accountability of competition authorities").&#13;
      About 64% of the respondents answered correctly on Q11 and 68.2% on Q12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Respondents' scores improved significantly on the post-test. Over 80% of respondents&#13;
      gave correct answers to Q1&#13;
      ("goals of competitive polic"), Q5 ("steps to assess whether a horizontal merger&#13;
      harms competition") and Q12&#13;
      ("education and publicity"). It was particularly notable that Q12 was answered&#13;
      correctly by all respondents (100%). The course organizer should note, however, that&#13;
      there were four questions on the post-test that were missed by more than half of&#13;
      respondents: Q2 ("market power"), Q3 ("reaching a cartel agreement among firms"),&#13;
      Q7 ("abuse of dominance"), and Q9 ("recommendation for authorities vis-à-vis natural&#13;
      monopoly industries"). Question 3 had a particularly low percentage correct; only 14%&#13;
      of respondents (N=6) were able to answer correctly. This suggested that the topics&#13;
      covered in the four questions may have been weak areas in participants' learning at&#13;
      the end of the course.&#13;
