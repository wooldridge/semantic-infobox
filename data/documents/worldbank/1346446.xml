            Telecom regulators : converging trends ?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Officials in developing countries with
            legal and political systems of continental European origin
            often argue that the model of independent regulatory
            agencies for utilities is appropriate only for Anglo-Saxon
            countries. Yet countries in continental Europe have also
            adopted this model. Comparing the telecommunications
            regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom, the United
            States, France, Germany, and Spain, this Note finds
            divergence in some respects but striking convergence in
            overall approach. This approach might not be right for all
            developing countries, but it cannot be rejected on the
            grounds that it works in Anglo-Saxon countries only.
