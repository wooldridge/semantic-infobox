Interview with Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
By Robert Oliver                                   July 10, 1961&#13;

&#13;
Schmidt:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m Orvis A. Schmidt, the director of the department of&#13;
&#13;
operations for the western hemisphere.   I joined the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
November 1947.   Before that time I had worked for 11 years with&#13;
&#13;
the United States treasury.    Much of my work--in fact, all of it&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#148; with the Treasury was in the international financial field.      In&#13;
&#13;
my early days with the Treasury I worked on Latin America and&#13;
&#13;
attended some of the early inter-American financial conferences,&#13;
&#13;
particularly the one that was then called the First Meeting of&#13;
&#13;
the Ministers of Finance of the American Republics, at which the&#13;
&#13;
idea of an inter-American bank was broached.    Prior to that, I&#13;
&#13;
had been stationed for a year in Brazil as the American Treasury&#13;
&#13;
representative there.    During the war I worked on foreign funds&#13;
&#13;
control and was also present at Bretton Woods in the capacity of&#13;
&#13;
secretary to Commission III.&#13;
&#13;
       At the time I joined the Bank, the Bank was about one year&#13;
&#13;
old.   I had known a little about the Bank, having worked for the&#13;
&#13;
preceding six months as the acting director of the Division of&#13;
&#13;
Monetary Research, which I helped to convert to the Office of&#13;
&#13;
International Finance.   I served as secretary of the National&#13;
&#13;
Advisory Council, which is the clearing house for all&#13;
&#13;
international financial operations of the United States&#13;
&#13;
government, including the American executive director on the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                - 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and the Fund.    I remember some of the early meetings at which the&#13;
&#13;
question of whether the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s bonds should be eligible for&#13;
&#13;
registration of the SEC was considered by the NAC--matters like&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
        At the time I joined the Bank it was shortly after McCloy&#13;
&#13;
had become president.    Garner was vice-president.   Black was the&#13;
&#13;
American executive director, and also clearly the man concerned&#13;
&#13;
with developing the market for World Bank bonds.      I was asked to&#13;
&#13;
join the Bank, to join the loan department of the Bank, at the&#13;
&#13;
time the office of the loan director was vacant.      Mr. Iliff had&#13;
&#13;
been already selected and his appointment announced, but he&#13;
&#13;
hadnâ&#128;&#153;t arrived yet, and the loan department was in charge of two&#13;
&#13;
assistant loan directors, as they were called:    Stanley Hoar and&#13;
&#13;
Walter Hill.    The organization of the Bank was substantially&#13;
&#13;
different then from what it is now.     The idea on which it had&#13;
&#13;
been based had been that the loan department was in charge of&#13;
&#13;
negotiating loans and working out individual lending&#13;
&#13;
arrangements.    The economic department, which was then headed by&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Rist, had charge of all the economic work, including the work&#13;
&#13;
of appraising creditworthiness, of evaluating economic strength&#13;
&#13;
of the individual countries.    The function of the end-use&#13;
&#13;
supervision was then in the treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s department.     There was no&#13;
&#13;
department of technical operations.     Nor was there any&#13;
&#13;
engineering staff.    In the first month or two that I was here I&#13;
&#13;
gathered that the engineering advice was obtained by Jack&#13;
&#13;
Madigan, who was the head of the firm of Madigan and Hylan in New&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
York, who used to spend some time here in the Bank and was&#13;
&#13;
consultant on such important engineering problems as arose.&#13;
&#13;
     Both the loan department and the economics department were&#13;
&#13;
divided into geographical subdivisions, and I came to be the head&#13;
&#13;
of what was to be the western European subdivision.    The other&#13;
&#13;
members at that time were Sandelin, Svoboda, Bob Skillings.&#13;
&#13;
There were eastern Europe, a couple of South American divisions--&#13;
&#13;
I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember too precisely.    But there was a good deal of&#13;
&#13;
switching around.    Once Iliff came, we had a number of different&#13;
&#13;
attempts to fit the people together and to share the work load&#13;
&#13;
more equitably.   There werenâ&#128;&#153;t a great many operations in the&#13;
&#13;
mill at that time.&#13;
&#13;
     Shortly after I came, General Wheeler came to set up what&#13;
&#13;
was then regarded as an engineering department or engineering&#13;
&#13;
service.   He decided, I think, that the appropriate place for the&#13;
&#13;
engineering service to be was in the loan department, and it&#13;
&#13;
remained there until the reorganization in 1952.    He also began&#13;
&#13;
with a nucleus of his staff to reconvert back to engineering some&#13;
&#13;
key people who had been trained as engineers but during the war&#13;
&#13;
had been doing what was usually regarded as economic work.    Some&#13;
&#13;
of these people were Wayne [inaudible] and [inaudible].   They are&#13;
&#13;
two that I remember.&#13;
&#13;
     I was asked by Iliff shortly after he came to work in the&#13;
&#13;
capacity of assistant to the loan director.    Stanley Hoar stayed&#13;
&#13;
on as assistant loan director, and Walter Hill was stationed in&#13;
&#13;
Europe as liaison with the economic organization that was set up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to administer the Marshall Plan.   This was the time when the&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan was first getting underway, and OEEC was organized&#13;
&#13;
to administer it.   It was regarded as sufficiently important for&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to have a top representative there, and Walter Hill was&#13;
&#13;
sent over there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does this suggest that the Bank was still interested in&#13;
&#13;
reconstruction lending at this time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, it was fairly well realized that the big bulk of&#13;
&#13;
the burden would be carried by the Marshall Plan.   But it was&#13;
&#13;
felt that we ought to tie it in and be coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there ever a time when an actual reconstruction loan was&#13;
&#13;
considered after the Marshall Plan had begun?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure a number of loans were made in Europe at the&#13;
&#13;
time.   Of course, the first big loans of the reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
character were made before the Marshall Plan in the interim&#13;
&#13;
between the cessation of Lend-Lease and the beginning of the&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan to tide programs over.   This particularly was true&#13;
&#13;
of the French loan and the loan to the Netherlands.   Once the&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan got into operation, I would say our operations in&#13;
&#13;
Europe were much more of a project character, with some loans&#13;
&#13;
also via the [inaudible] Bank, as I remember.   Mr. Cope would&#13;
&#13;
have a much clearer recollection of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      During the years from â&#128;&#153;49 to â&#128;&#153;52, a good part of the time&#13;
&#13;
was determining policy and procedures.    The staff was increasing,&#13;
&#13;
and the work load began to increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if I could ask about the dates.   You say â&#128;&#153;49 to â&#128;&#153;52?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Along in there.   â&#128;&#152;Fifty-two was the time when the Bank&#13;
&#13;
was reorganized and when its area departments were set up; the&#13;
&#13;
department of technical operations was set up.    But by that time&#13;
&#13;
a number of loans had been made, and it was felt that a different&#13;
&#13;
organization could handle the work load more effectively.    But&#13;
&#13;
from about â&#128;&#153;49 on--â&#128;&#153;48, â&#128;&#153;49--almost every loan raised a lot of&#13;
&#13;
policy questions; new procedures were being developed; and in my&#13;
&#13;
capacity as assistant to the loan director I sat in on a lot of&#13;
&#13;
inter-departmental committees that threshed these things out.&#13;
&#13;
The concept of the working party as a means of a borrowing or&#13;
&#13;
lending operation, coordinating the legal department, the&#13;
&#13;
economic department, the loan department; the treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
department was developed very early--I would say about â&#128;&#153;48.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It had not been developed by the time you arrived in November&#13;
&#13;
of â&#128;&#153;47?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, by that time the Bank had only made three loans,&#13;
&#13;
I think, the French loan, the Dutch loan and possibly a Danish&#13;
&#13;
loan and one to Luxembourg.    But these were mostly reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loans, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m not too clear just how they were handled.   But&#13;
&#13;
when I arrived, a mission had returned from Italy which had been&#13;
&#13;
headed by Owen [inaudible], and there was a question as to how we&#13;
&#13;
considered their conclusions.   Iliffâ&#128;&#153;s coming, of course, led to&#13;
&#13;
more of an emphasis on regularizing procedures.   Somewhere in&#13;
&#13;
there, shortly after Iliffâ&#128;&#153;s arrival, I would say, this concept&#13;
&#13;
of a working party as such became more exclusively recognized, at&#13;
&#13;
any rate, with the loan department being the chairman of the&#13;
&#13;
working party and exercising the sort of guiding relationship to&#13;
&#13;
see that everything that had to be done to push an operation&#13;
&#13;
forward was being done, even though different parts of the work&#13;
&#13;
load were carried by the different departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would the working party be likely a field working party also&#13;
&#13;
or would this be. . .?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   No, this was a way of coordinating work here, although&#13;
&#13;
it was recognized that missions in the field would also have&#13;
&#13;
representatives of different departments.   Usually they would be&#13;
&#13;
more the loan and economic departments in those days working&#13;
&#13;
together or subsequently area and technical department&#13;
&#13;
operations.   Legal would come along when there was a special&#13;
&#13;
legal problem, but this was comparatively rare.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you tell once again the division of functions between the&#13;
&#13;
members of the working party?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 6 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Well, the economic department in those days prepared&#13;
&#13;
the economic reports on the countries as well as the more general&#13;
&#13;
background studies that are the background of the economic&#13;
&#13;
department today; so there had to be a much closer relation&#13;
&#13;
between the economic department and the operations than there was&#13;
&#13;
after the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
        I found also when I first joined the Bank that there&#13;
&#13;
apparently had been a great deal of antagonism between the two&#13;
&#13;
departments, because I had hardly reported for work when I was&#13;
&#13;
invited to a dinner at the Statler, I believe it was, and I found&#13;
&#13;
all the key members of the loan and economic departments had been&#13;
&#13;
invited to this dinner.    It was chaired by McCloy and Garner, and&#13;
&#13;
the purpose of the dinner was to talk over the working&#13;
&#13;
relationships between the economic department and the loan&#13;
&#13;
department and how they could be conducted smoothly and without&#13;
&#13;
apparently some of the antagonisms that had arisen.    The whole&#13;
&#13;
evening after the dinner was devoted to a discussion of how the&#13;
&#13;
two departments ought to work together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of the antagonisms that had developed and how&#13;
&#13;
were they resolved?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t too clear to me because I was new at the&#13;
&#13;
time.    I think it was a question of who was responsible for the&#13;
&#13;
judgment as to whether a country was really creditworthy and&#13;
&#13;
whether you should be able to make a loan.    Was this an economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
department judgment or was it a loan department judgment?    Could&#13;
&#13;
a fellow from the economic department go off on his own and write&#13;
&#13;
a report about the economy of the country or should he be&#13;
&#13;
accompanied by the loan officer in charge?    And this at a time&#13;
&#13;
when the number of operations in the mill were comparatively few,&#13;
&#13;
so there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a lot of real work to do, and everybody was&#13;
&#13;
hassling over who should do what, trying to get in on the&#13;
&#13;
interesting and important things that were going on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were the people in the loan department at the time engineers&#13;
&#13;
primarily?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   No.   Well, here, again, there was a rather interesting&#13;
&#13;
point.   When I joined, I gather that they had a splinter function&#13;
&#13;
between the loan officer and the regular operating people of the&#13;
&#13;
department.    The idea was that when you carried an operation up&#13;
&#13;
to a point where you were ready to negotiate, these people, the&#13;
&#13;
few who had the capacity, were then to step in and do the&#13;
&#13;
negotiating.     People who were then in that capacity were Tommy&#13;
&#13;
Burland and Dorsey Stephens.    I later heard explanations as to&#13;
&#13;
how this had developed, that the function had been a more&#13;
&#13;
expedient way of trying to clear the way for others to come in&#13;
&#13;
and push the work that was necessary to get the job done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were both Burland and Stephens attorneys?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   No, but they had a background in Wall Street and had&#13;
&#13;
both been [inaudible], but they were much older than the staff&#13;
&#13;
that was coming in at the time, and actually this concept never&#13;
&#13;
really worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does the fact that they were in charge of specific&#13;
&#13;
negotiations imply that by early â&#128;&#153;48 Mr. Garner, for example, had&#13;
&#13;
ceased to be the leading negotiator?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   No, I would say that at the time I came here it was&#13;
&#13;
recognized that if this was to work effectively here,&#13;
&#13;
negotiations couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be done at the top level.    They would have&#13;
&#13;
to be done at the staff level.    I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there was ever any&#13;
&#13;
question about that.   I understand that this may have been a&#13;
&#13;
question in the days before I got here.    But it was recognized&#13;
&#13;
that you had to operate at staff level, and everything was set up&#13;
&#13;
to get the work done that way and as effectively as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As I understand it, then the loan department was primarily&#13;
&#13;
concerned with the actual negotiations while the economic&#13;
&#13;
department was to provide background economic information to be&#13;
&#13;
useful in the negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.   Then who was to appraise the project&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t too clear.   If it was anybodyâ&#128;&#153;s province, it was the loan&#13;
&#13;
departmentâ&#128;&#153;s province.     But, as I say, they were only beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there a staff loan committee at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Yes, there was a staff loan committee.    That had&#13;
&#13;
already been established when I got here.   A lot of the reports&#13;
&#13;
that laid the basis for subsequent operations were then being&#13;
&#13;
written and were being started.   My first mission for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
was to go with Craig-Martin to Europe to talk to the colonial&#13;
&#13;
offices of the U.K., France and Belgium, because it was expected&#13;
&#13;
at that time that a number of colonial applicant projects would&#13;
&#13;
come to the Bank; and the particular concern of management was&#13;
&#13;
that the colonies shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be making plans without knowing what&#13;
&#13;
each other were planning.   If you were planning railroads, they&#13;
&#13;
ought to be coordinated so they tied together; the same with&#13;
&#13;
roads.   And it was to talk in their vein that we were to talk.&#13;
&#13;
In the summer of â&#128;&#153;48 Craig-Martin and I must have spent a month&#13;
&#13;
in Europe talking first to the French, then with the British and&#13;
&#13;
then with the Belgians.   We wrote a number of reports.   A point&#13;
&#13;
that has interested me is to see how many of the projects that&#13;
&#13;
have subsequently have come along were being talked about in&#13;
&#13;
those days.   The Kariba Gorge hydroelectric project, which we&#13;
&#13;
subsequently financed, was then discussed with us, and the Volta&#13;
&#13;
River plan that weâ&#128;&#153;re now working on was one of the things that&#13;
&#13;
we learned about then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was this attempt to coordinate projects extended even in the&#13;
&#13;
case of neighboring countries which were completely different in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 10 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
national administration, or was it just within the British&#13;
&#13;
colonies. . .?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   No.   The idea we had was to coordinate among the&#13;
&#13;
colonies of the different countries, not just within the British&#13;
&#13;
sphere, but to see that the British, the French, and the Belgians&#13;
&#13;
knew more or less what each other were thinking of in terms of&#13;
&#13;
basic investment of a type that might fit into each other.&#13;
&#13;
     The next operation that I worked on was the loan for&#13;
&#13;
timber-producing equipment to increase the output of sawn&#13;
&#13;
softwood lumber in eastern Europe and its export to western&#13;
&#13;
Europe.    In the days of reconstruction softwood was particularly&#13;
&#13;
scarce and was very much needed.    The ECE, the Economic Committee&#13;
&#13;
for Europe, which is a dependency of the United Nations, had&#13;
&#13;
developed a project for purchasing trucks, saws, tractors, things&#13;
&#13;
like that, to open up new forest lands in Finland, Yugoslavia,&#13;
&#13;
Austria, and they wanted the Bank to assist in financing this&#13;
&#13;
project.   Nurick, Dorsey Stephens and I went to Geneva and met&#13;
&#13;
with the Economic Committee for Europe.    We had had a prior&#13;
&#13;
meeting with the staff loan committee to discuss this particular&#13;
&#13;
operation, and of course the key question that arose was:      where&#13;
&#13;
were the eastern Europe countries going to get the dollars to&#13;
&#13;
repay loans?     Because this was going to increase their exports to&#13;
&#13;
western Europe, but the western European countries were going to&#13;
&#13;
be paying for it in their own terms.     And so we agreed at the&#13;
&#13;
staff loan committee level that we should try to work out an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 11 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
arrangement whereby the countries that benefited from the&#13;
&#13;
increased production of lumber should themselves provide the hard&#13;
&#13;
currency needed to repay the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   These would be the importing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   The importing countries.    We finally succeeded in&#13;
&#13;
working out two loans of this type--one to Finland and one to&#13;
&#13;
Yugoslavia, and I believe it was our first loan to Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
They were quite short-term loans.     I believe they were two years.&#13;
&#13;
And the distinguishing feature of them was that in each case a&#13;
&#13;
group of four western European countries, such as the U.K.,&#13;
&#13;
Switzerland, Netherlands, Italy, France, agreed to pay for a&#13;
&#13;
certain percentage of their timber imports to the Bank in dollars&#13;
&#13;
to repay the loan.   And this was in effect the way it worked out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if I might ask about the Polish loan which never was&#13;
&#13;
made.   Was this in the works at the time, and were some of the&#13;
&#13;
negotiations similar to this Finnish loan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, the Polish loan I was not in on the negotiations,&#13;
&#13;
so I know very little about that background.     I understand they&#13;
&#13;
were very close to a deal, and it was only a question of the size&#13;
&#13;
of the loan that prevented it from going forward at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Finnish loan would have been early â&#128;&#153;48?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 12 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, it took quite a while to get these things signed.&#13;
&#13;
We started working on them in â&#128;&#153;48, in the autumn of â&#128;&#153;48.   But the&#13;
&#13;
complexity of getting the four western European countries to sign&#13;
&#13;
up these agreements delayed the actual signing of the loans for&#13;
&#13;
quite a while; so that they may not have been signed until late&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#153;49.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I take it that you didnâ&#128;&#153;t think of this as a reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
loan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, it was obviously to aid the reconstruction of&#13;
&#13;
Europe, but in a sense it was a project in that it was a specific&#13;
&#13;
list of goods designed to accomplish one particular limited&#13;
&#13;
objective rather than as the earlier reconstruction loans had&#13;
&#13;
been, the equipment for a variety of purposes needed to&#13;
&#13;
strengthen the economy of a country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Had the precedent of importers actually setting aside hard&#13;
&#13;
currencies to repay a loan to the exporting countries been&#13;
&#13;
followed subsequently?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think it has.   I think we may have in one of&#13;
&#13;
our early loans to Iraq had an allocation of oil royalties&#13;
&#13;
pledged, but I think it was cancelled.   Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure it went through&#13;
&#13;
that way, if my recollection is correct, but I have the feeling&#13;
&#13;
it was subsequently cancelled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 13 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of the other precedent-setting projects that&#13;
&#13;
were being considered at this time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Well, the next thing that I recall which was probably&#13;
&#13;
of that type was the mission that we had to Ethiopia in the early&#13;
&#13;
spring of 1950.    Ethiopia had had a mission of the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
government there right after the war, and it had prepared a very&#13;
&#13;
elaborate set of recommendations for investments in Ethiopia.       At&#13;
&#13;
the time, of course, there were shortages everywhere of&#13;
&#13;
everything.    So it was very easy to conclude, as this mission&#13;
&#13;
did, that Ethiopia ought to start all kinds of industries to&#13;
&#13;
produce practically everything that there was.&#13;
&#13;
        I was asked by Mr. Iliff to become the first head of that&#13;
&#13;
mission, though I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t had any experience with Ethiopia at the&#13;
&#13;
time.    A group of us get out from the United States and went by&#13;
&#13;
boat to London where we conferred with a member of the British&#13;
&#13;
government.    We then went to France where we talked with the&#13;
&#13;
French government, because we knew of the French ownership of the&#13;
&#13;
only railroad in Ethiopia, which was a problem at the time.       We&#13;
&#13;
also acquired some members of our mission along the way.&#13;
&#13;
        The mission was a good-sized mission.   We had Bill Welk and&#13;
&#13;
Hugh Collier, who drew up the economic report.     Jean de Fargues,&#13;
&#13;
a French engineer, was a consultant on transportation.      Art&#13;
&#13;
Wubnig was transportation economist.     Then we had Bill Crawford&#13;
&#13;
from the British Middle East Planning Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 14 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     We spent about two months in Ethiopia.   When we got there&#13;
&#13;
it was very apparent to us that you could do very little along&#13;
&#13;
the lines that had been recommended by the American mission, and&#13;
&#13;
we told the key members of the government whom we were dealing&#13;
&#13;
with, the principal one then being [inaudible] but also&#13;
&#13;
[inaudible] that we would prefer to ignore the conclusions of&#13;
&#13;
this earlier mission and to make our own determination as to what&#13;
&#13;
would have the highest priority in terms of pushing the&#13;
&#13;
development of the country.&#13;
&#13;
     One of the things they wanted to do was to bring some&#13;
&#13;
people in and build the Assab road, the road to the port of&#13;
&#13;
Assab, which the Italians had started and never finished.    We&#13;
&#13;
were impressed by the fact that during the occupation of Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
the Italians had spent very large sums of money--it was estimated&#13;
&#13;
in the hundreds of millions--to build a pretty grandiose road&#13;
&#13;
system, but for lack of maintenance the highway system was&#13;
&#13;
practically impassable.   Large sections were washed out, and it&#13;
&#13;
was impossible to go from any one city to any other and be sure&#13;
&#13;
of when you were going to arrive.   This impressed us with the&#13;
&#13;
need for having an organization that could not only build&#13;
&#13;
highways but could maintain them and carry out a sensible highway&#13;
&#13;
program.   So we suggested the establishment of what has since&#13;
&#13;
become the Imperial Highway Authority, an organization designed&#13;
&#13;
to build and maintain highways.   We felt that it would take a&#13;
&#13;
long while before you could staff this organization entirely with&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopians, but you could get a management contract with a group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 15 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of consulting engineers or some other knowledgeable body to&#13;
&#13;
furnish key men to run the authority and then gradually begin to&#13;
&#13;
develop your own local staff.    As a matter of fact, they first&#13;
&#13;
entered into a contract with the United States Bureau of Public&#13;
&#13;
Roads to provide the key staff for the Imperial Highway&#13;
&#13;
Authority, and this organization is still in existence, and I&#13;
&#13;
believe the Bank has made a second loan for highways.&#13;
&#13;
     We also found a communications system that was completely&#13;
&#13;
inoperative.   There were telephones in Addis Ababa, but there was&#13;
&#13;
absolutely no long-distance service, and it was impossible to&#13;
&#13;
find out what was going on in any part of the country without&#13;
&#13;
actually going there, and we felt that the rehabilitation of the&#13;
&#13;
telephone system had a very high priority, but again you needed&#13;
&#13;
an organization that was capable of operating it.   The telephones&#13;
&#13;
were then under the administration of the government.   They had&#13;
&#13;
no idea even what their gross receipts were on telephones, much&#13;
&#13;
less any of the other facts that were needed.   So again we&#13;
&#13;
suggested that some type of a telephone organization be set up to&#13;
&#13;
which they agreed, and we then hired and paid for a mission of a&#13;
&#13;
group of experts to go and in effect prepare the projectâ&#128;&#148;prepare&#13;
&#13;
the engineering plans and the programs that would be carried out&#13;
&#13;
with our loan, to bring the telephone system back into operation&#13;
&#13;
and keep it that way.   Again, you had to make a management&#13;
&#13;
contract.   I believe in this case they did it with the Swedish&#13;
&#13;
telephone authority.    I think that that organization is still in&#13;
&#13;
effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 16 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is this one of the first times that the Bank as a&#13;
&#13;
precondition to a loan insisted upon the establishment of sound&#13;
&#13;
internal management of a project?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Insofar as I know, it was.   I havenâ&#128;&#153;t had a chance&#13;
&#13;
since I last talked with you to check back as to what the other&#13;
&#13;
loans were.   But it was an absolutely essential condition to&#13;
&#13;
doing much of anything there.    Of course, you could always build&#13;
&#13;
a road by farming it out to some foreign firm of contractors who&#13;
&#13;
would build it and move out.    But having seen what had happened&#13;
&#13;
to the roads that were already there, we felt that this wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
be any real contribution to the development of the country.       What&#13;
&#13;
you had to begin to do along with carrying out individual&#13;
&#13;
projects was to develop organizations that were capable of seeing&#13;
&#13;
that the highway system was maintained and gradually expanded as&#13;
&#13;
needed and the same for your telephones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did the telephone system remain government owned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Yes, it remained government owned, but it was put into&#13;
&#13;
an autonomous organization which had its own management and its&#13;
&#13;
own financial status.   Gross receipts came into the telephone&#13;
&#13;
company.    They covered costs, took care of depreciation, serviced&#13;
&#13;
the debt.   If there were a profit, they could go to the&#13;
&#13;
government as the stockholder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 17 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the Bank insisted that revenues should cover costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Yes.   At that time we wanted to see it binding that it&#13;
&#13;
could pay for itself.&#13;
&#13;
        The third recommendation of this mission was that the small&#13;
&#13;
bank that they had in existence be converted to a development&#13;
&#13;
bank.    The bank was run by one man then, and it was largely&#13;
&#13;
buying and selling coffee as its principal function.      It had very&#13;
&#13;
small resources, made a few small loans, most of which were&#13;
&#13;
frozen.    We felt that there was an opportunity for an&#13;
&#13;
organization that could play a role in financing private&#13;
&#13;
investment.    There were a lot of companies that had been started&#13;
&#13;
by the Italians, which had then been vested by the Ethiopian&#13;
&#13;
alien property custodian after the Italians had been ejected and&#13;
&#13;
had been sold to various people.    Most of these businesses were&#13;
&#13;
operating, but they needed loans to expand, to round out the&#13;
&#13;
business; and it seemed to us that an effective bank could play&#13;
&#13;
an important part in fostering the growth of industry and&#13;
&#13;
agriculture.    We recognized that for such a bank to be effective&#13;
&#13;
you would have to have a staff that could play quite an important&#13;
&#13;
role in helping to develop projects, teaching people how you went&#13;
&#13;
about the preparation of projects.       This bank is still in&#13;
&#13;
existence.    The loans went very slowly.     I donâ&#128;&#153;t think the staff&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank ever took the concept that we had in mind at the time&#13;
&#13;
we set it up and pursued it as vigorously as it might have.      But&#13;
&#13;
we had made loans through the [inaudible] bank, but as far as I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
know, this was the first time that we had ever set up a new&#13;
&#13;
development bank or converted a bank to be a development bank in&#13;
&#13;
the history of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operations up till then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This Ethiopian loan was in â&#128;&#153;49 perhaps?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    No.    The mission went in â&#128;&#153;50, and my recollection would&#13;
&#13;
be that the loans were probably assigned in late â&#128;&#153;50 and early&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#153;51.   It took quite a time to get people to jump through the&#13;
&#13;
various hoops they had to.     You needed a decree setting up the&#13;
&#13;
Imperial Highway Authority.     They had to allocate part of the&#13;
&#13;
money needed to cover the local currency costs of the project.&#13;
&#13;
You had to find people to staff it.       And they agreed to do these&#13;
&#13;
things, but agreeing and carrying them out are quite different&#13;
&#13;
things.    We had to keep after them.     I might say that shortly&#13;
&#13;
after the ideas were accepted and the groundwork was laid for&#13;
&#13;
carrying these things out, this operation was handed to, I&#13;
&#13;
believe, Mr. Rucinski, who was in charge of that area at the&#13;
&#13;
time, and I continued in my duties as assistant to the loan&#13;
&#13;
director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You mentioned the other day that the Korean War had an&#13;
&#13;
important effect upon the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Yes.   At the time that the outbreak of fighting&#13;
&#13;
occurred in Korea, the United States government began to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 19 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reestablish its control over equipment and material.    And, there&#13;
&#13;
was a serious question as to whether this might not cut back the&#13;
&#13;
lending of the World Bank in the sense that there would be little&#13;
&#13;
cause for making a loan if with the money you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t procure&#13;
&#13;
the equipment that would be needed to carry out the project.    One&#13;
&#13;
has to bear in mind that at that time the primary source of heavy&#13;
&#13;
equipment in the entire world was the United States.    European&#13;
&#13;
countries still needed most of the equipment they could produce&#13;
&#13;
for their own programs and werenâ&#128;&#153;t back in the exporting business&#13;
&#13;
on any large scale; so that the bulk of the money being lent by&#13;
&#13;
the United States was used to procure large tractors, generators,&#13;
&#13;
turbines and things like that in the United States.    In order to&#13;
&#13;
cope with this problem, the Bank set up a special unit headed by&#13;
&#13;
Sam Anderson.   This unit had the function of clearing with the&#13;
&#13;
United States government whether equipment would be made&#13;
&#13;
available for any particular project, so that we would know&#13;
&#13;
before we made a loan that the money could be used to procure&#13;
&#13;
this equipment.   Anderson during the war had worked with the War&#13;
&#13;
Production Board and had worked in this particular field.    He had&#13;
&#13;
joined the Bank somewhere around â&#128;&#153;49, coming here from the&#13;
&#13;
Marshall Plan agency.   In the Bank he had started to work on&#13;
&#13;
Latin America, but when the Korean crisis came, he was taken off&#13;
&#13;
that work and was given this special responsibility; and for a&#13;
&#13;
period of about a year, I would say, there was quite an operation&#13;
&#13;
in the consideration of any particular project because you would&#13;
&#13;
have to first clear it with the materials-handling section of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
U.S. and see that the U.S. agreed that the project had a high&#13;
&#13;
enough priority so that generators or Caterpillar tractors or&#13;
&#13;
large shovels and things like that could be spared and made&#13;
&#13;
available for that particular project.   It was at that time that&#13;
&#13;
I moved over and started to work on Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did the volume of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s loans decrease materially during&#13;
&#13;
the period of the Korean War?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have a feeling on that.   I know that some of&#13;
&#13;
my friends up in New York were telling me that the Bank was just&#13;
&#13;
going to be put out of business completely by the fact that no&#13;
&#13;
equipment was going to be available for this purpose.   But I&#13;
&#13;
never took this very seriously, and it seems to me that our&#13;
&#13;
operations continued throughout this episode about the same as&#13;
&#13;
usual.   The other handicaps toward making a loan, the problems of&#13;
&#13;
getting an effective basis for putting a project forward, were&#13;
&#13;
probably much more of an effective force for slowing down&#13;
&#13;
operations than was this additional hurdle of getting the United&#13;
&#13;
States clearance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   During this period of â&#128;&#153;48 through â&#128;&#153;50 was it more or less&#13;
&#13;
established policy that the Bank could make loans only for&#13;
&#13;
specific projects?   Did it totally abandon the general purpose&#13;
&#13;
approach of the reconstruction period?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Well, the charter of the Bank says that its loans&#13;
&#13;
should be for projects except in special circumstances.        After&#13;
&#13;
the few reconstruction loans, most of the lending was on a&#13;
&#13;
project basis.   The principal exception I can think of was&#13;
&#13;
Australia, where we did loan for programs rather than for&#13;
&#13;
individual projects.   I think after one or two of those we even&#13;
&#13;
worked with the Australians to convert any future operations onto&#13;
&#13;
a project basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You were talking earlier about your investigations in Africa&#13;
&#13;
and the related projects.   Did that not lead to the concept of&#13;
&#13;
programs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:    Well, again, the word â&#128;&#156;programâ&#128;? is a word that has a&#13;
&#13;
variety of connotations and meanings depending upon whoâ&#128;&#153;s using&#13;
&#13;
it at a particular time.    We have been striving in the Bank from&#13;
&#13;
the beginning to try to get the various countries to coordinate&#13;
&#13;
into a sensible program of investment the projects that they were&#13;
&#13;
carrying out.    And this has been a very difficult thing.     I know&#13;
&#13;
this has been so in Latin America.       Even in the very early days,&#13;
&#13;
in approaching these things, we in the Bank had in our own minds&#13;
&#13;
and in our own work the concept of what made a sensible set of&#13;
&#13;
investments for the country at the time.      For example, I&#13;
&#13;
mentioned Ethiopia.    We came up with three things simultaneously&#13;
&#13;
that supplemented each other.    Highways werenâ&#128;&#153;t going to be of&#13;
&#13;
too much use if you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t communicate.      So we put the highways&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and the telecommunications together and pushed them forward&#13;
&#13;
simultaneously with the idea of a development bank to round out&#13;
&#13;
those efforts and to push along on the industrial side.   In our&#13;
&#13;
early lending in Nicaragua, we started with highways, went along&#13;
&#13;
simultaneously with farm machinery for clearing and bringing into&#13;
&#13;
production the land that would be opened up by the new roads, set&#13;
&#13;
up a development bank for agricultural lending to help the&#13;
&#13;
farmers finance the purchase of equipment, to set up grain&#13;
&#13;
storage silos so that the new crops could be dried, cleaned and&#13;
&#13;
stored; so that while it was difficult to get the countries&#13;
&#13;
themselves to think in terms of program, in our own lending to a&#13;
&#13;
foreign country we would have in mind a series of projects to be&#13;
&#13;
carried out over a fairly short period which complemented each&#13;
&#13;
other and reinforced each other.    And I would say this has been&#13;
&#13;
true all the way along.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about the import requirements for the project as distinct&#13;
&#13;
from the domestic purchase requirements for these projects?   What&#13;
&#13;
was the policy on this issue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Here again the policy was initially that we financed&#13;
&#13;
only the foreign exchange cost, which was the cost of imported&#13;
&#13;
goods or services.   The first departure from that I think people&#13;
&#13;
in the European department could tell you better than I, because&#13;
&#13;
they were the industrialized European countries that could&#13;
&#13;
provide for themselves the heavy equipment needed to carry on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
project--Italy, Austria and subsequently Japan.   The first&#13;
&#13;
departure in Latin America was in Mexico, where about 1958 or&#13;
&#13;
thereabouts in response to a request from the Mexicans we agreed&#13;
&#13;
that where you had types of equipment that might be manufactured&#13;
&#13;
in Mexico but might also conceivably be imported, we would agree&#13;
&#13;
that if bids were called for on the basis of international&#13;
&#13;
bidding and the low bidder was a Mexican firm, we would finance&#13;
&#13;
the entire cost of the procurement of that item in Mexico.     Now,&#13;
&#13;
this was an extension of an earlier concept which we had gone&#13;
&#13;
along with in Mexico and a number of other countries.   That is,&#13;
&#13;
where the item could be, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, assembled locally out of&#13;
&#13;
imported components, we would finance the imported components.&#13;
&#13;
This was true of some of our early loans for power.   There was a&#13;
&#13;
company in Mexico that was producing electrical equipment, and we&#13;
&#13;
agreed that where that company was the low bidder, we would&#13;
&#13;
reimburse that part of the cost that was imported components.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, in our loan for the rehabilitation of the Pacific&#13;
&#13;
railroad in Mexico, I believe the low bidder for the supply of&#13;
&#13;
the freight cars was a Mexican firm that was importing cheap&#13;
&#13;
components--trucks, wheels, axles and things like that.   We&#13;
&#13;
financed the imported components, but the local currency costs of&#13;
&#13;
assembling them and building whatever came from local materials&#13;
&#13;
was financed locally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In the case of the Ethiopian loan, was there a very large&#13;
&#13;
currency component?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 24 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Orvis Schmidt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   Well, there was, particularly in the highways, but they&#13;
&#13;
had at the time a substantial kitty, which were the profits that&#13;
&#13;
they had made--I believe it was the reevaluation of some of their&#13;
&#13;
gold reserves--and we got them to agree to allocate these for the&#13;
&#13;
highway program.   The local currency costs of the telephone&#13;
&#13;
project were not substantial.    Most of the labor and the&#13;
&#13;
materials had to come from abroad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I would like to ask some questions about South America and&#13;
&#13;
also about your experiences in the Treasury even before you came&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank, but perhaps you would like to do that another time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Schmidt:   I think it would be better, because Iâ&#128;&#153;m a little late&#13;
&#13;
now for a meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Orvis Schmidt held on July 10, 1961
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In July 1961, Orvis Schmidt was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert Oliver. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1947 to 1967, Mr. Schmidt worked in the following
            areas: in the loan department beginning in 1947 and then as
            a chief for the Latin American division (1951-1956); in the
            department of operations as director of the western
            hemisphere (1956-1964); and as a special advisor to the
            president (1964-1967). His first mission for the World Bank
            sent him to Europe to talk to the colonial offices of the
            United Kingdom, France, and Belgium. His transcript concerns
            a failed loan to Poland and successful loans to Finland, to
            countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region,
            and to Ethiopia. He also discusses the effect of Korean War
            on the World Bank.
