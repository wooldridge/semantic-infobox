&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

The water supply and sanitation sector in Cameroon is          The progress between urban and rural water supply&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Implement the national policy in rural areas (division of roles, coordination).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Encourage more stakeholders to assume their roles: communes (local authorities), the private sector, and users.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Provide the sanitation sector with a dedicated directorate with dedicated resources.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Put in place budget planning tools and improve the effectiveness of expenditure.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Balance the allocation of finance more equally between the water supply and sanitation subsectors.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Set up an annual sector review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Complete the inventory of facilities and introduce a method for keeping this up-to-date.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop technical capacities (particularly for the construction of small piped systems) by mobilizing the private sector,&#13;
     encouraging competition.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Accelerate the transfer of contracting authority responsibilities to the communes.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increase staffing levels within the Ministry of Energy and Water (MINÃ&#137;E) (support to stakeholders, programmatic&#13;
     approach).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improve financial tracking within the subsector (investment, recurrent costs, subsidies, revenue).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Streamline Camwaterâ&#128;&#153;s public procurement procedures to improve utilization rates of funding committed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Within MINÃ&#137;E, create a structure at directorate level entirely dedicated to sanitation.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 In consultation with subsector stakeholders, set up an operational strategy (approaches to be used to promote&#13;
     hygiene, subsidy levels, types of facility, and technologies used).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Ensure the completed legal texts differentiate between urban sanitation (wastewater) and drainage (stormwater) so&#13;
       that the former is attached to MINÃ&#137;E via a specialized directorate that is given full responsibility for the subsector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop strategic plans for sanitation in urban areas.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Establish an agreement with the lessee of the concession area to implement the actions set out in the strategic plan.&#13;

1.	Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. This CSO2 report has been&#13;
produced in collaboration with the Government of Cameroon and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage, a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments, and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

 Year	Event&#13;
 1952	 Creation of the Ministry of Agricultureâ&#128;&#153;s Agricultural Engineering Department (Service du GÃ©nie Rural), supplying&#13;
       the rural population of the north of the country&#13;
 1962	 Creation of the Office of Water within the Ministry of Transport, Mines and Telecommunications (MinistÃ¨re des&#13;
       Transports, des Mines et des TÃ©lÃ©communications), responsible for ground water exploration and conducting&#13;
       inventories of water points&#13;
 1968	 Creation of the National Water Supply Company of Cameroon (SNEC: SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Eaux du Cameroun)&#13;
       to whom the state granted the operation of public water supply networks in the towns for a period of 40 years&#13;
 1977	 Creation of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MinistÃ¨re des Mines et de lâ&#128;&#153;Ã&#137;nergie), responsible for WSS in urban&#13;
       centers, whilst rural areas remained under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
 1984	 Law No. 084/013 pertaining to water regulations (but with no implementing provisions)&#13;
 1988	 Reorganization of the ministry in charge of water that becomes the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water (MinistÃ¨re&#13;
       des Mines, de lâ&#128;&#153;Ã&#137;nergie et de lâ&#128;&#153;Eau), responsible for WSS for the whole of the country through the Directorate of&#13;
       Rural Water Supply (DHR: Direction de lâ&#128;&#153;Hydraulique Rurale) and the Directorate of Urban Water and Sanitation&#13;
       (DEAU: Direction de lâ&#128;&#153;Eau et de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement Urbain)&#13;

       urban towns&#13;
 1998	 Prior to this, legal texts were only concerned with the protection of resources. A new law (No. 98/005) pertaining to&#13;
       water regulations is supplemented by implementing provisions, as of 2001, that also pertain to the management&#13;
       of the service&#13;
 1999	 Start of the SNEC privatization process (limited Invitation to Tender for 51 percent of shares)&#13;
 2000	 Provisional acquisition of SNEC by the French utility company, â&#128;&#152;Suez Lyonnaise des Eauxâ&#128;&#153; (ONDEO Services)&#13;
 2002	 Nomination of a temporary administrator to oversee the privatization process and ensure continuity of the public&#13;
       water service&#13;

     â&#128;¢	   Improve the effectiveness of expenditure (abandon the pricing information system, increase competition).&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Balance the allocation of finance more equally between the water supply and sanitation subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The processes for planning, budgeting, and utilization            of external resources, year on year, for the 2002â&#128;&#147;07&#13;
of finance allocated to the WSS sector have been erratic          periodâ&#128;&#153;. The best estimates of budget allocations to the&#13;
over the past decade. Only some of the necessary tools            WSS sector over the period 2002â&#128;&#147;07 period show a steady&#13;
are in place or operational which renders the monitoring          decrease until 2006 (a year with no external financing),&#13;
of financial performance very difficult and could lead to         with water supply and sanitation being accorded only a&#13;
the scorecard results ultimately being revised down (see          very small proportion of the national budgetâ&#128;&#148;0.1 percent&#13;

&#13;
First of all, the fact that the sector still does not have&#13;
                                                                  Figure 6&#13;
appropriate budget planning tools is cause for concern.           Scorecard indicator scores relating to financing,&#13;
Whilst there has been a national MTEF (Medium-Term                compared to peer group13&#13;
Expenditure Framework) in place since 2006, there is neither&#13;
an MTEF nor a performance budget at ministerial or sector                                   RWS&#13;
level. This means that the budget preparation process&#13;
remains highly centralized at Ministry of Finance (MINFI)&#13;
level, providing the sector ministries little opportunity to&#13;
translate their strategy into budget-lines or to ensure there&#13;
                                                                      USH                                UWS&#13;

The situation regarding budget allocations is equally&#13;
concerning. In its review of public expenditure undertaken&#13;
in April 2009, the World Bank noted that, for the rural&#13;

This decline in allocations has now been reversed with                   only means that there is a certain level of finance being&#13;
a total of over US$100 million committed to the WSS                      wasted, but also that the target set out in the national&#13;
sector over the 2010â&#128;&#147;12 period. Cameroon now faces                       action plan (of between 3,000 and 3,500 water points per&#13;

to be 45 percent in 2007, meaning that 3.7 million people                per year between 2009 and 2015, as opposed to the 1.1&#13;
had access to an improved source of drinking water. At                   percent annual increase seen between 1990 and 2008.&#13;
this pace, the access rate will have reached 61 percent                  In other words, Cameroon will have to double its current&#13;
for rural areas by 2015, which is below the target of 75                 effort. Given the amount of financing that has so far been&#13;
percent set by the government in the 2003 PRSP.16                        committed to the subsector for the next few years, it&#13;

 One of the distinctive characteristics of UWS in Cameroon           per year already acquired. If this trend continues, all&#13;
 is the fact that the networks built in YaoundÃ© and                  investment requirements will be met by 2015, including:&#13;
 Douala succeed in satisfactorily covering these two large           the development of individual connections to the network&#13;

 This positive situation is reinforced by the prospects for          lies in the completion of the sector reform that led to the&#13;

           â&#128;¢	    Within MINÃ&#137;E, create a directorate level structure entirely dedicated to sanitation and with its own staff.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 In consultation with subsector stakeholders, set up an operational strategy (approaches to be used to&#13;
              promote hygiene, subsidy levels, types of facility, and technologies used).&#13;
           â&#128;¢	    Accelerate the transfer of contracting authority responsibilities to communes.&#13;

&#13;
 JMP data indicates that the access rate to improved                  progress observed in access to services has nonetheless&#13;
 sanitation in rural areas has not changed since 1990 (35             been accompanied by a sharp reduction in the open&#13;
 percent, see Figure 18). This means that the number of               defecation rate, which stood at 21 percent in 1990 and at&#13;
 new facilities built each year does not exceed the rate              10 percent in 2008. It can only be assumed that this is a&#13;
 of population growth. Therefore, in relative terms the               result of households choosing traditional latrines, only 50&#13;
 subsector has not progressed.                                        percent of which are estimated to be improved, according&#13;

 This stagnation is not surprising as there is no large-scale&#13;
 program in place for sanitation in rural areas. UNICEF,              To rectify the situation, investment of US$55 million per&#13;
 WHO, the Ministry of Health (MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ©), and             year will be required up to 2015, plus US$4 million per&#13;

 all the latrines constructed have been built by households           It will also be necessary to set up a ministerial directorate&#13;
 themselves, without external support and with only the               dedicated specifically to sanitation. At the moment, there&#13;

                 so that the former is attached to MINÃ&#137;E via a specialized directorate that is given full responsibility for the&#13;
                 subsector.&#13;

 According to the JMP, access to improved sanitation in                 latrines with a slab and, perhaps, a septic tank, or even&#13;
 urban areas regressed between 1990 and 2008, moving                    unimproved latrines (which are then not included in the&#13;
 from 65 percent down to 56 percent. As a result of this                JMP access rate calculation).&#13;
 and the lack of progress in urban sanitation, Cameroon&#13;
 is certain not to reach the sanitation MDG target (see                 In contrast to rural areas, urban sanitation comes under the&#13;
 Figure 22).                                                            remit of two well-defined structures. The lease contract&#13;

 This worrying situation can be explained by the very high              des Eaux entrusts the operation of wastewater sewerage&#13;
 population growth experienced in the two main towns,                   systems to the latter, in the same way as for stormwater&#13;
 Douala and YaoundÃ©, and by the virtual absence of funding              drainage. However, at the moment, the two entities&#13;
 allocated to the subsector. Due to a lack of maintenance               (Camwater and CdE) are not active in this area. They have&#13;
 and rehabilitation, the sewerage systems in the town                   neither carried out an inventory of existing facilities nor&#13;
 centers, which date from the colonial era, are blocked,                monitor the access rate. In addition, the term â&#128;&#153;sanitationâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
 whereas newer PVC systems in the new neighborhoods                     (though probably referring more to stormwater drainage)&#13;
 cannot be used as there is no operational treatment plant.             is also present in the texts allocating responsibilities to&#13;
 The majority of the population therefore rely on traditional           the Ministry of Urban Development and Habitat; this&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Cameroon :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of country status overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This second CSO
            report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Cameroon and other stakeholders during
            2009-10. The analysis aims to help countries assess their
            own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water
            supply and sanitation services in each of four subsectors:
            rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation
            and hygiene. The second CSO analysis has three main
            components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to
            assess the adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard
            which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The second CSO's contribution
            is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance
            are sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific
            issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively
            turned into accelerated coverage in water supply and
            sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have
            been identified through consultation. A synthesis report,
            available separately, presents best practice and shared
            learning to help realize these priority actions.
