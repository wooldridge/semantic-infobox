                     MR. WOODS:    Good morning, gentlemen.&#13;
&#13;
                     We meet this morning as the Directors of IDA .&#13;
&#13;
           And the first item of business relates to the minutes of the&#13;
&#13;
           meeting which we had on February 3.     That's document M66-3.&#13;
&#13;
                     Has any Director any questions or comments with&#13;
&#13;
           respect to M66-3?     [Silence]&#13;
&#13;
                     In the absence of such, the ddcument is approved.&#13;
&#13;
                     We come now to the recommendation with respect&#13;
&#13;
           to development credit for Ethiopia, which is the principal&#13;
&#13;
           reason for the meeting this morning .    It's document R66-5 .&#13;
&#13;
           It relates to an educational project, which it seems to me&#13;
&#13;
           is particularly interesting .&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Samii is with us this morning to present&#13;
&#13;
           orally the general aspects of this credit.     And Mr. McMahon&#13;
&#13;
           will comment on the particular project.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Samii, will you join us?&#13;
&#13;
                        [Mr. Samii came to the table]   Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. SAMII:    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Board:&#13;
&#13;
                     The proposed Education Credit is the second credit&#13;
&#13;
           to Ethiopia and, together with the Highway Credit of 1963,&#13;
&#13;
           will increase our total commitment to about $21 million as&#13;
&#13;
           compared with total Bank loans of about $57 million.         This is&#13;
&#13;
           still a hard blend.     In the past our financing has been&#13;
&#13;
           repeatedly    channeled into highway construction and&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         4&#13;
           telecommunications, with a small amount to the Development&#13;
&#13;
           Bank of Ethiopia.     Our efforts to enter other areas were&#13;
&#13;
           frustrated by the lack of suitable projects.      Fortunately,&#13;
&#13;
           last year for the first time, we found it possible to par-&#13;
&#13;
           ticipate in the development of a large Electric Power project.&#13;
&#13;
           The present Education project and the prospective Agricultura&#13;
&#13;
           Credit project and a Water and Sewage project for the city&#13;
&#13;
           of Addis Ababa would certainly be welcome additions to the&#13;
&#13;
           areas with which we have been associated with in the past&#13;
&#13;
           and most likely will continue to be associated in the future.&#13;
&#13;
                      In the latter part of November when the financing&#13;
&#13;
           of the Telecommunications project was being considered, my&#13;
&#13;
           colleagues, Mr. Kruithof and Mr. Scheltema,    presen~ed   to you&#13;
&#13;
           the latest general and economic information about Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
           The situation reported to you at that time has obviously&#13;
&#13;
           undergone no significant change.&#13;
&#13;
                      In our previous reports, we have not been very&#13;
&#13;
           optimistic about the future economic development of the&#13;
&#13;
           country in spite of its potential possibilities for rapid&#13;
&#13;
           growth.   We pointed out that Ethiopia's performance in cer-&#13;
&#13;
           tain   sector~   such as exports, transport and power, has been&#13;
&#13;
           satisfactory.      But until much greater efforts are made in&#13;
&#13;
           removing the structural impediments to the development of&#13;
&#13;
           traditional agriculture, accompanied with substantially&#13;
&#13;
           higher investment, one could not speak of prospects of rapid&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           5&#13;
&#13;
           development.    Furthermore, it is disconcerting that the&#13;
&#13;
           central Government's investment expenditures, which reached&#13;
&#13;
           the peak of $38 million in 1962-63, are budgeted to decline&#13;
&#13;
           to about $30 million for the present fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
                       However, there are grounds for greater optimism in&#13;
&#13;
           the number of individual projects in the productive sectors,&#13;
&#13;
           for which external financing is now being arranged, or those&#13;
&#13;
           projects now under preparation, which may indicate that the&#13;
&#13;
           volume of investment is in fact on the rise.&#13;
&#13;
                       The Government hopes to arrange financing of $9&#13;
&#13;
           million with the United States Agency for International&#13;
                           four&#13;
           Development for/small industrial projects that are estimated&#13;
&#13;
           to cost about $12 million.    These are:     a glass factory,&#13;
&#13;
           a mineral water bottling plant, an oil crushing factory,&#13;
&#13;
           and the expansion of a wool factory.       The Government is&#13;
&#13;
           discussing with AID the financing of over $20 million for&#13;
&#13;
           the final engineering and construction of a hydroelectric&#13;
&#13;
           project on the Finchaa River.    This project is estimated to&#13;
&#13;
           cost over $30 million.&#13;
&#13;
                       Perhaps most important, in the long run, are&#13;
&#13;
           arrangements presently under negotiation with AID for an agro&#13;
&#13;
           industrial survey for identification and preparation of&#13;
&#13;
           projects.    The survey will require a year and a half to two&#13;
&#13;
           years and will cost over $1 ,million.      IFC, as you know, is&#13;
&#13;
           currently examining the possible debt and equity participatio&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
            in a +arge agricultural development project, (this is the&#13;
&#13;
            Matahfa sugar and sisal project) with an estimated total&#13;
&#13;
            cost of $23 million.     The establishment of a meat packing&#13;
&#13;
            plant, that is estimated to cost over $3 million, is also&#13;
&#13;
            under active consideration.       The Government has submitted&#13;
&#13;
            to the Bank preliminary information on the fourth highway&#13;
&#13;
            construe tion project, which would require substantia 1 ex-&#13;
&#13;
            ternal assistance.      We are discussing with the Government the&#13;
&#13;
            necessary arrangements for a review of the organization and&#13;
&#13;
            operations of the Imperial Highway Authority, so that the&#13;
&#13;
            Authority would be in a better position to undertake major&#13;
&#13;
            new investments.     Execution of the projects mentioned here&#13;
&#13;
            is to start within a     yea~   to be completed in four or five&#13;
&#13;
            years.&#13;
&#13;
                       These are some of the indications that greater&#13;
&#13;
            efforts are being made by the Ethiopian and outside agencies&#13;
&#13;
            in the preparation of projects that might lead to higher&#13;
&#13;
            levels of investment in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
                       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. WOODS:      Thank you, Mr. Samii.&#13;
&#13;
                      Mr. McMahon.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McMAHON:     Mr. Chairman, and Members of the&#13;
&#13;
            Board:   The aims of this project are threefold:       first,&#13;
&#13;
            secondary school enrollment will be increased and the quality&#13;
&#13;
            of the education will rise.        Second, the facilities for&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                        7&#13;
&#13;
           technical education will be expanded to meet the needs of a&#13;
&#13;
           growing industrial sector.    And, third, teacher training&#13;
&#13;
           will be increased to meet the needs created by this expansion&#13;
&#13;
           and to reduce the dependence on expatriates.&#13;
&#13;
                     The urgent need to improve quality and increase&#13;
&#13;
           student output arises from the fact that only 1% of the 13-18&#13;
&#13;
           year old children attend secondary schools, a ratio which is&#13;
&#13;
           probably the lowest in any developing country.    The cor-&#13;
&#13;
           responding figures for Ghana and Pakistan are 16% and 18%&#13;
&#13;
           respectively.   From a population of 22 million, less than&#13;
&#13;
           1,000 students complete semndary schools each year and&#13;
&#13;
           only 200 of these are at a standard high enough to permit&#13;
&#13;
           university entrance.&#13;
&#13;
                     The project will provide a 65% increase of student&#13;
&#13;
           enrollment in 77 of the country's planned total of 78&#13;
&#13;
           secondary schools.     This increase, supported by a greatly&#13;
&#13;
           improved supply of trained teachers and teaching facilities,&#13;
&#13;
           is expected to result in a 300/o increase in students suc-&#13;
&#13;
           cessfully completing a secondary education.&#13;
&#13;
                     A revision of the school curricula to include&#13;
&#13;
           agricultural, commercial and technical subjects has already&#13;
&#13;
           taken place, but visits paid by the mission to various&#13;
&#13;
           schools found an acute shortage of workshops and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
           Hence, the project will provide the additional buildings and&#13;
&#13;
           equipment required for these new practical subjects.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           8&#13;
&#13;
                      An experimental feature at two schools is the&#13;
&#13;
           addition of trade training facilities which will be used&#13;
&#13;
           not only by the secondary school boys, but also by about&#13;
&#13;
           670 students who will attend part-time day or evening&#13;
&#13;
           classes.   If this experiment proves successful, it is in-&#13;
&#13;
           tended to provide similar additions at other secondary&#13;
&#13;
           schools.&#13;
&#13;
                      The replacement of one and the expansion of a&#13;
&#13;
           second technical institute is included in the project to&#13;
&#13;
           provide more buildings and new instructional equipment.&#13;
&#13;
           This will result in an increase in the number of students&#13;
&#13;
           from 800 to 2,000, and so help to meet the urgent demand&#13;
&#13;
           for trained manpower for developing industry.&#13;
&#13;
                      The demand created by the project for teachers of&#13;
&#13;
           practical subjects will be met by a Practical Teacher Train-&#13;
&#13;
           ing Institute to accommodate 270 students.     Cooperation&#13;
&#13;
           with the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
&#13;
           has resulted in arrangements for a six-man team from Utah&#13;
&#13;
           University to staff this Institute for a number of years.&#13;
&#13;
           A Utah University team is already operating a successful&#13;
&#13;
           training program for academic   teachers~   And the effect of&#13;
&#13;
           these two complementary programs will be to increase the&#13;
&#13;
           proportion of trained secondary school Ethiopian teachers&#13;
&#13;
           from the present 7% to 22% by 1970 and to 80% by 1980.&#13;
&#13;
                      A higher quality of student entering secondary&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                          9&#13;
&#13;
           schools will result from provision for an increased output&#13;
&#13;
           of trained primary school teachers.    This will be undertaken&#13;
&#13;
           at two institutes for 800 trainees and produce nearly 400&#13;
&#13;
           qualified teachers per year.   A UNESCO/UNICEF team will&#13;
&#13;
           provide staff for these two institutes.&#13;
&#13;
                     In sum, the project will increase by three times&#13;
&#13;
           the number of young people completing secondary level&#13;
&#13;
           education, increase the quality of all trained students, and&#13;
&#13;
           so make them better fitted for useful and skilled employment&#13;
&#13;
           in industrial, commercial and administrative posts.     And,&#13;
&#13;
           finally, it will ensure an adequate supply of trained teach-&#13;
&#13;
           ers and eventually eliminate the need for expatriate and&#13;
&#13;
           untrained teachers.&#13;

                     I won't have to say very much, because Mr. McMahon&#13;

           has highlighted the specifics of the project.     On the basis&#13;
&#13;
           of the experience of the observations I have made, other&#13;
&#13;
           countries--underdeveloped countries and less industrial&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         10&#13;
           countries--have particularly welcomed the emphasis which is&#13;
&#13;
           put in this project on including practical subjects into the&#13;
&#13;
           high school curriculum; and, also, the secondary schools,&#13;
&#13;
           of which Mr. McMahon spoke, which provide part day and&#13;
&#13;
           evening classes in practical subject matters.&#13;
&#13;
                      I cannot help, also, being very much pleased about&#13;
&#13;
           the cost consciousness which shines through this report.          I&#13;
&#13;
           couldn't help comparing the figures I find in this report&#13;
&#13;
           with figures we had a number of years ago, in 1962, when we&#13;
&#13;
           launched the first project, the Tunisian educational project.&#13;
&#13;
           At that time, the cost per:resident pupil   turned out to be--&#13;
&#13;
           if I recall it correctly, without my files--between $2,500&#13;
&#13;
           and $5,000 per resident student.&#13;
&#13;
                      In this case, in Ethiopia, we find here for&#13;
&#13;
           high schools, for construction, a figure of about $200 per&#13;
&#13;
           pupil.   And, for the construction of youth hostels, where&#13;
&#13;
           the students live, $140 per person, per student.&#13;
&#13;
                      Now, this is a tremendously far cry from the figure&#13;
&#13;
           we had at that time, where admittedly we didn't have any&#13;
&#13;
           experience.   The explanation given by the staff, at that&#13;
&#13;
           time, was that where they build using European standards&#13;
&#13;
           they don't have the material on which the Europeans rely, and&#13;
&#13;
           which they would have to import.&#13;
&#13;
                      The report here makes   comparison~   with regard to&#13;
&#13;
           the costs of this construction, with England--pointing out&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            11&#13;
&#13;
           how much more they are, and how favorably they compare with&#13;
&#13;
           costs in England.    But, I would assume, that these costs&#13;
&#13;
           would also compare favorably with what is spent for school&#13;
&#13;
           construction in other lesser developed countries.         Even&#13;
&#13;
           if I assumed that Tunisia, at that time, was an exceptional&#13;
&#13;
           case, I am inclined to believe--but, maybe, I could be&#13;
&#13;
           refuted, if I am wrong--that the methods employed here,&#13;
&#13;
           to repeat, would compare favorably with all the experiences&#13;
&#13;
           we had in lesser developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Samii spoke of the structural impairments,&#13;
&#13;
           which, so far, have hampered very much the development of&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia.    He spoke of the necessity of breaking   ~p    old&#13;
&#13;
           structures, and their having to develop new attitudes"&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, if this interpretation of mine is correct--&#13;
&#13;
           that, the Ethiopian Government is that cost conscious,&#13;
&#13;
           as this text would indicate they are Â·; ., and, if it is true, as&#13;
&#13;
           in a private talk with Mr. McMahon I heard, that the Ethliopia&#13;
&#13;
           Government wouldn't have objected against d~inishing, de-             &lt;&#13;
                                                                                 .&#13;
           creasing these figures even more--when I see that a governmen&#13;
&#13;
           is so cost conscious I would assume that they are well on the&#13;
&#13;
           road along which progress can be expected.&#13;
&#13;
                       I had one question, in addition, if I may ask this,&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman.    In those paragraphs on the external debt of&#13;
&#13;
           the country, reference is made to the large undisbursed part&#13;
&#13;
           of the credits Ethiopia has gotten so far.     Now, with regard&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
            to the figures that apply to the Bank loans, and the IDA&#13;
&#13;
            credits, a satisfactory explanation has been given in the&#13;
&#13;
            documents.     These projects have developed more or less as&#13;
&#13;
            expected.     So that, as a consequence, though there is still&#13;
&#13;
            an overhang from previous Bank loans, of IDA credits, nothing&#13;
&#13;
            particularly amazing is involved in this.&#13;
&#13;
                         And when I look at the table, which I find in the&#13;
&#13;
            document, current economic position and prospects of&#13;
&#13;
            Ethiopia, Table 1, then I observe that so little of the&#13;
&#13;
            loans which Ethiopia has received from the Sino-Soviet Bloc&#13;
&#13;
            has remained undisbursed--loans from the U. So S. R.,&#13;
&#13;
            and loans from Czechoslovakia.        As far as I know, these are&#13;
&#13;
            old loans.     We talked about this particular situation some&#13;
&#13;
            time ago.&#13;
&#13;
                         My question is:     Are these, indeed, her r undisburse&#13;
&#13;
            amount of credits from old loans; or are they newer loans?&#13;
&#13;
                         In case they are remnants of old loans, what is the&#13;
&#13;
            reason that the Ethiopian Government doesn't draw more quickl&#13;
&#13;
            on the resources it has available from other governments?&#13;
&#13;
                         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR.   WOODS~   Thank you, Dro Donner.&#13;
&#13;
                         Who is prepared to respond to that question for&#13;
&#13;
            Dr. Donner?&#13;
&#13;
                         Mr. Scheltema.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SCHELTEMA:     The large undisbursed portion of&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                13&#13;
&#13;
           the Sino-Soviet loans is, in the first place, explained by&#13;
&#13;
           what is generally the trouble, or was more or less the&#13;
&#13;
           trouble--that there are no        well~defined   projects to which&#13;
&#13;
           the foreign loans can easily be allocated.&#13;
&#13;
                       Moreover, I don't know whether this is entirely&#13;
&#13;
           correct, because it is based on what one hears, but the&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopian Government has the impression that these loans are&#13;
&#13;
           rather expensive, work out rather expensive, and are there-&#13;
&#13;
           fore a bit hesitant to use this very large amount of&#13;
&#13;
           Rbls := I5tm!hllion.   But, I must repeat, this is what I hear.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Expensive, in terms of interest rates?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SCHELTEMA.     Not officially in terms of inter-&#13;
&#13;
           est rates, but--&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     In terms of what the money must be spen&#13;
&#13;
           for?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SCHELTEMA:    Yes.     Indeed, yes.   That's what&#13;
&#13;
           I mean.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       Well, did your question, Dr. Donner, limit itself&#13;
&#13;
           to the loans from the--&#13;
&#13;
                       DR. DONNER:    Yes.    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     --SoviEt Bloc?&#13;
&#13;
                       DR. DONNER:    That's the biggest unexplained block.&#13;
&#13;
           There is a backlog from IBRD loans, and IDA credits, but an&#13;
&#13;
           explanation has been given in the documents.          And this, I&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                   14&#13;
           believe--      It is true that these Russian and Czech loans&#13;
&#13;
           are old ones .&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SCHELTEMA :         Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                         DR. DONNER:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SCHELTEMA:          The main project executed under&#13;
&#13;
           the Soviet loan is the oil refinery which is not yet&#13;
&#13;
           completed .&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. WOODS:       Thank you very much .&#13;
&#13;
                         DR. DONNER:       Since this I believe is an interesti ng&#13;
&#13;
           subj ect matter in general, in addition to being interesting&#13;
&#13;
           for Ethiopia, could we maybe hear something . from Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           McMahon about what the explanation. is forÂ· this faverable&#13;
&#13;
           picture we get here as to the costs of this project?&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. WOODS:       Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                         Mr . McMahon .&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. McMAHON :      I think there are several factors&#13;
&#13;
           that made the building cost cheap.              First of all, the&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopians wanted African standards and not Ethiopian&#13;
&#13;
           ones.   Their initial suggestion to us for students' resi-&#13;
&#13;
           dents was in the form of mud huts .             They wanted some mud hu ts&#13;
&#13;
           --the Czech construction out there .             This, we wouldn't go&#13;
&#13;
           along with.&#13;
                         We, eventual l y, persuaded them to accept a con-&#13;
&#13;
           crÂ·e'te block construction, and still insist upon keeping&#13;
&#13;
           the standards for students down to quite a             -~~s~~ble    level .&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                 15&#13;
&#13;
                        In the classrooms, they wanted to allow only one&#13;
&#13;
           square meter, about 11 square feet, to each student; which&#13;
&#13;
           we felt was far too small for secondary school students.&#13;
&#13;
           We tried to argue one and a half square meters with them,&#13;
&#13;
           and, in the end, we compromised on one and a quarter square&#13;
&#13;
           meters.&#13;
&#13;
                        Building costs in Ethiopia, too, are quite cheapo&#13;
&#13;
           There is plenty of labor, plenty of building construction&#13;
&#13;
           available"     They can make most of their own materialso            They&#13;
&#13;
           have their own cement factories.            They make their own&#13;
&#13;
           steel trusses for the roofs.         So that the amount of imported&#13;
&#13;
           material is kept down to a quite small amount.&#13;
&#13;
                        But the main factor was the desire of the&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopians to keep costs down to a minimum, and to get the&#13;
&#13;
           most that they possibly could for their money.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR.   WOODS~    A refreshing point of viewo&#13;
&#13;
                        D~    DONNER:    Yes, it is.     The   Eth~opian   Government&#13;
&#13;
           didn't try to bring about a demonstration, for its part?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:      Noo   No.    We had several meetings on&#13;
&#13;
           this to try to get them to raise their standards to what&#13;
&#13;
           we thought to be a reasonable standard in order to enable&#13;
&#13;
           the education to proceed smoothly.&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo WOODS:      And they did raise their standards&#13;
&#13;
           somewhat.&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo McMAHON:      Reluctantly, they did raise them;&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
           yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       We     eliminated the mud construction, for concrete&#13;
&#13;
           blocks.    And we raised the one square meter to one and a&#13;
&#13;
           quarter square meters.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:       So you might say, Dr. Donner, that&#13;
&#13;
           this Ethiopian affair is rather related to Ethiopian standard&#13;
&#13;
           whereas, the Tunisian affair was rather related to Western&#13;
&#13;
           European standards.&#13;
&#13;
                       Well, one of my regrets, I may say, Dr. Donner, is&#13;
&#13;
           that I    did~~t   J6in this Bank about six months before I did--&#13;
&#13;
           at the time Mr. Black originally wanted me to join it--with&#13;
&#13;
           the result that I would have been he.re at the discussion of&#13;
&#13;
           this famous, or infamous, Tunis educational loano         As it is,&#13;
&#13;
           I hear about it constantly, but had no participation in&#13;
&#13;
           it; and it must have been quite an interesting affairo            It&#13;
&#13;
           was approved, I think, in September or October of '62.&#13;
&#13;
                        Does that satisfy your inquiry?&#13;
&#13;
                        DR.   DONNER~    Yes.   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:      Any other Director?&#13;
&#13;
                        Dr. Lieftinck.&#13;
&#13;
                        DRo   LIEFTINCK~    Mr. Chairman, I warmly welcome&#13;
&#13;
           this proposal for the development credit to Ethiopia for&#13;
&#13;
           secondary vocational education.          I think if any country&#13;
&#13;
           qualifies for IDA support, I think it is Ethiopia with its&#13;
&#13;
           very low level of income per capita, and its small foreign&#13;
&#13;
           debt bearing capacity.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                          17&#13;
                        It is interesting to look at the budget expendi-&#13;
&#13;
           tures in Table 8 of the Annex, the economic report, in order&#13;
&#13;
           to get an impression of what the Government is doing.      And&#13;
&#13;
           we presently note that the item which has shown the greatest&#13;
&#13;
           increase is national defense.      If one compares this with the&#13;
&#13;
           very minor amount,which we have, spent by the Minister of&#13;
&#13;
           Agriculture, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and the&#13;
&#13;
           Minister of Public Works and Communications, one has the&#13;
&#13;
           impression that much more will have to be done in the economi&#13;
&#13;
           sectors than presently is the case.&#13;
&#13;
                        But I fully agree that this all is conditioned by&#13;
&#13;
           improvement of the scale and quality of education, primarily&#13;
&#13;
           in the secondary leveL&#13;
&#13;
                          I fully associate myself with the observation&#13;
&#13;
           made by Mr. Donner on the economic and financial aspects of&#13;
&#13;
           the project.&#13;
&#13;
                        I am very pleased to note that in this case the&#13;
&#13;
           project is adjusted to national conditions, which reflects&#13;
&#13;
           itself in the cost figures.&#13;
&#13;
                         I only have a few questions to ask in order to show&#13;
&#13;
           my interest in the project.&#13;
&#13;
                         It is mentioned in the technical report, which I&#13;
&#13;
           consider an excellent report, paragraph 16 on page 5, that&#13;
           11&#13;
                Enrollment of general secondary students in non-government&#13;
&#13;
           schools amounts to about 13% of the total but the number is&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
           not expected to rise substantially because of the high costs&#13;
&#13;
           involved in following the Ministry's new curriculum."&#13;
&#13;
                      Is my understanding correct:       that, this present&#13;
&#13;
           project, being financed by IDA, will only benefit the&#13;
&#13;
           government schools?     And I would like to ask what are the&#13;
&#13;
           expectations with respect to the non-government schools?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. WOODS:     Mr. McMahon, will you answer the ques t i n .&#13;
&#13;
                      DR. LIEETIN&lt;::K:    The second question is that I&#13;
&#13;
           noted that recurrent costs of the project will be on the&#13;
&#13;
           order of Eth$ 2 1/2 a year.       And I would like to inquire&#13;
&#13;
           whether education is free--primary and secondary education;&#13;
&#13;
           or, whether any fees have to be paid?&#13;
&#13;
                      And, thirdly, I do think that the actual success&#13;
&#13;
           of the whole prog:mm will depend, to a large extent, on the&#13;
&#13;
           success in reducing the drop-out rate, which is very high&#13;
&#13;
           also in the secondary schools.        And since this is, in my&#13;
&#13;
           opinion, such an overriding element in the results to be&#13;
&#13;
           ~hieved,   I would like to have some information, if possible,&#13;
&#13;
           what are the expectations in this respect, and what is being&#13;
&#13;
           done, or intended to be done, in order to reduce considerably&#13;
&#13;
           the drop-out rate.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. WOODS:     Thank you, Dr. Lieftinck.&#13;
&#13;
                      Mr. McMahon.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McMAHON:       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       On the three questions, Mr.     Chai~an,   paragraph 16&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                               19&#13;
&#13;
           deals with the high cost .of secondary education.         It is&#13;
&#13;
           higher than it was because we are now putting in practical&#13;
&#13;
           schemes into schools, and the cost of practical schemes&#13;
&#13;
           is very much higher than academic schemes.          And, for this&#13;
&#13;
           reason,    we didn't think--      Or, at any rat:e, we discussed&#13;
&#13;
           this with some private schools out there, and they felt&#13;
&#13;
           they would not be able to meet the new curriculum which&#13;
&#13;
           the Ministry were going to insist upon in private schools.&#13;
&#13;
                       For this reason, we feel that no expansion in&#13;
&#13;
           private schools is likely to take place.&#13;
&#13;
                       DR.   LIEFTINCK~    May I ask here what is the&#13;
&#13;
           character of these non-government schools?          Are they at a&#13;
&#13;
           higher level, or--&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:       They are on a lower level, and they&#13;
&#13;
           were run by religious bodies, mainly, with the idea of&#13;
&#13;
           producing that type of persono&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     None of the funds we are contemplating&#13;
&#13;
           providing here go to the non- government schools?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:       None at all.    They are all directed&#13;
&#13;
           at government schools.         That is true.&#13;
&#13;
                       The second point, about the recurrent costs.&#13;
&#13;
           Education is all freeo         There are no fees at all in the&#13;
&#13;
           schoolso&#13;
&#13;
                       The third point, about drop-out rate, this, of&#13;
&#13;
           course, is always a difficult matter in underdeveloped&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                              20&#13;
&#13;
           countries.     We hope, and we think, that the provision of&#13;
&#13;
           good equipment, and, particularly, the provision of the&#13;
&#13;
           better quality teacher, will reduce the drop-out rate.&#13;
&#13;
                        I understand that UNESCO have done an investigation&#13;
&#13;
           into this matter, and they take the view that an improvement&#13;
&#13;
           in teachers is likely to reduce the drop-out rate consider-&#13;
&#13;
           ably.&#13;
&#13;
                        DR. LIEFTINCK:      Nevertheless, I think that the&#13;
&#13;
           contribution that this project is expected to make--it&#13;
&#13;
           cannot be measured by the additional enrollment facilities&#13;
&#13;
           which it creates, particularly, by the number of people who&#13;
&#13;
           will have the full benefit by not dropping out.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. McMAHON:      Well, we think this:   that, the&#13;
&#13;
           effect of this will probably be that instead of having&#13;
&#13;
           11,000   students~-if       the present drop-out rate continued,&#13;
&#13;
           there would be 11,000 students finishing up at grade         7~Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           we think that 16,800 would still be in the primary schools&#13;
&#13;
           at grade 7, if we put in the better quality of primary&#13;
&#13;
           school teachers that we hope.&#13;
&#13;
                        So there should be an increase, a very, very sub-&#13;
&#13;
           stantial improvement in the drop-out rate, because of the in-&#13;
&#13;
           creased quality of teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR.   WOODS~     These estimates that we have, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           McMahon, are on the basis that the drop-out rate will improve&#13;
&#13;
                        MR"   McMAHON~    Yes, indeed.   Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                             21&#13;
&#13;
                     MRo WOODS:      That may be the answer to your ques-&#13;
&#13;
           tion, Dr. Lieftinck.      For whatever reason, this technical&#13;
&#13;
           report puts in the foundation piece that the drop-out rate&#13;
&#13;
           will decrease; that is, vzill improve.        And the reason given&#13;
&#13;
           is that the teaching will be better, and, presumably, the&#13;
&#13;
           facilities will be more attractive.&#13;
&#13;
                      Were there any other reasons?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McMAHON:        I think the facilities will be&#13;
&#13;
           one of them.,    There has been tremendous overcrowding in&#13;
&#13;
           schools, and if we increase the school capacity, and improve&#13;
&#13;
           the teachers, we think that this will keep students there.&#13;
&#13;
           I think many students just get tired of inferior equipment,&#13;
&#13;
           inferior accommodation, inferior students; and they leave for&#13;
&#13;
           those reasons.&#13;
&#13;
                        The failure rate, of course--apart from drop-out,&#13;
&#13;
           the failure rate of students is very high.         They don't get&#13;
&#13;
           promoted from one grade to the next, and this, again, should&#13;
&#13;
           be improved by teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                        DR. LIEFTINCK:      If I may, sir, I have understood&#13;
&#13;
           that the figures given in this report are figures for&#13;
&#13;
           additional enrollment.&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo McMAHON:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                        DR.. LIEFTINCK:     But not figures for additional&#13;
&#13;
           graduates.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, the ratio between enrollment and graduation&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                              22&#13;
&#13;
           may improve.&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:     Right.&#13;
                        DR. LIEFTINCK:     Or, is it different than--    I&#13;
&#13;
           assume that the figures given here are not only figures for&#13;
&#13;
           enrollment, but this counts for the fai:hures and the drop-&#13;
&#13;
           outs, and the estimated number of graduateso&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:     We have planned the schools on the&#13;
&#13;
           assumption, of course, that there will continue to be some&#13;
&#13;
           drop-outs.     There are some schools we have planned with, say,&#13;
&#13;
           a five-scream entry at grade 7; and this will taper off&#13;
&#13;
           to probably a three-or four-stream in the upper levels.&#13;
&#13;
           So we have to take into account in the planning of the&#13;
&#13;
           ~hools   some drop out.     The drop-out rate is a much smaller&#13;
&#13;
           rate than has been taking place in the past.&#13;
&#13;
                        The enrollments, of course, is the number of&#13;
&#13;
           places which are being made available in schools.        And we&#13;
&#13;
           hope they     will all be filledo We hope the drop out will&#13;
&#13;
           be kept down to fill all those places in the upper levels.&#13;
&#13;
                        We found out there that the facilities in the&#13;
&#13;
           upper grades of    schoo~     were not adequately used always      be~&#13;
&#13;
           cause of the big drop-out rate in the early yearso           You&#13;
&#13;
           find that the initial forms--grades 1 and grades 2--were&#13;
&#13;
           filled up with students; and the top ones were half empty.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:     You have a chart, haven't you, that&#13;
&#13;
           you were looking at, Mr. McMahon, that reflects the decrease&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            23&#13;
&#13;
           in the drop-out rate--the chart that puts the guesstimate&#13;
&#13;
           on how many?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR.. McMAHON:       Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:        I think that--   Dr. Lieftinck?&#13;
&#13;
           What is the number?        Annex 5?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR.   McMAHON~      Annex 5o&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:        Annex 5, Dr. Lieftinck ?&#13;
&#13;
                     You [Dr. Lieftinck] were addressing your questions,&#13;
&#13;
           I think, from the paragraph in the text which relates only&#13;
&#13;
           to enrollments o&#13;
&#13;
                     DR.    LIEFTINCK~     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:        And this chart, if I understand it&#13;
&#13;
           correctly, covers both--both enrollments and completions.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McMAHON:        Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:        Anyone else on this matter?&#13;
&#13;
                         Mr. Mirza.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. MIRZA:        Thank you, Mro Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     I, too, give my full and very warm support to this&#13;
&#13;
           very good project, and for a very great and worthy objective.&#13;
&#13;
           Indeed, this is one of those projects about which there can&#13;
&#13;
           hardly be any two opinions, about its urgency and about its&#13;
&#13;
           importanceo&#13;
&#13;
                     And I would particularly like to congratulate&#13;
&#13;
           you, Mro Chairmano     That is to say, to meet about two-thirds&#13;
&#13;
           of the total expenditures, that is not only the full&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            24&#13;
&#13;
           estimated foreign exchange costs, but, also, roughly, half&#13;
&#13;
           the local expenditureo&#13;
&#13;
                      I particularly want to welcome this feature, and&#13;
&#13;
           this fully meets the circumstances of this countryo&#13;
&#13;
                        I am a little bit upset by this contingency in the&#13;
&#13;
           consultants' fees, which are as high as 16%.          I wonder why&#13;
&#13;
           the consultants' fees, which is about a million dollars--&#13;
&#13;
           $:.92 million--considering the nature of this project&#13;
           (it is school construction and curriculum) that it should not&#13;
&#13;
           be so very expensive.     In my v#,ew, the consultants' know-how&#13;
&#13;
           should not be of that high, sophisticated-type, know-how;&#13;
&#13;
           like the one which we associate normally with industries.&#13;
&#13;
           I was wondering if there is any particular reason for this.&#13;
&#13;
                        And I would also like to see more of the technical&#13;
&#13;
           institutes    which~-according   to this   ~igure   before me, there&#13;
&#13;
           was going to be only one new construction, and only two&#13;
&#13;
           primary teacher training institutes.        While I am very happy&#13;
&#13;
           that there will be as many as 54 secondary schools, I wish&#13;
&#13;
           these, too, would have been a little more, considering the&#13;
&#13;
           serious shortage of the candidates for teachers in this&#13;
&#13;
           country.&#13;
                        I wonder if some observation could be made on this.&#13;
&#13;
                        Thank you, Mro Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:   Yes, Mr. Mirza.&#13;
&#13;
                        Can you respond to that, Mr. McMahon--to those&#13;
&#13;

                       MR.   McMAHON~               Well, on the question of consultants'&#13;
&#13;
           fees, Ethiopia is a very large and difficult country, and&#13;
&#13;
           the sites of the schools are spread throughout the countryo&#13;
&#13;
           The cost of supervision of these sites we think will be&#13;
&#13;
           quite high. Â· Compam&lt;l with the compact project in one building&#13;
&#13;
           site,   t.he consultants 1 fees for this supervision will be&#13;
&#13;
           relatively higho      We hope they will get it for less than the&#13;
&#13;
           figure we have quoted.                    But we feel that this is the sort&#13;
&#13;
           of figure that we would have to allow for at this stageo&#13;
                        tec h&gt;Â·..-vJ. .&#13;
                     On ~anus ~nst~tutes, we have put only two down.&#13;
&#13;
           We felt that because there had been no manpower survey in&#13;
&#13;
           the country which would justify the training of technicians--&#13;
&#13;
           it is expensive, very expensive, this training--we felt until&#13;
&#13;
           there was a' manpower survey that we could not justify the&#13;
                                  t"~~-J.&gt; \.-. ,.._ ; ( "' ),&#13;
           p:-ovision of extra tetanu-s- institutes at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:             Thank youo&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Thor.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. THOR:          Mr. Chairman, I would like to join my&#13;
&#13;
           colleagues here who have welcomed this IDA project for&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia.    I    welco~e       it; and I will support it.&#13;
&#13;
                       It was shocking to me to see that this very old&#13;
&#13;
           nation has still only $40 income per capita, and see how&#13;
&#13;
           slow the developing of the country has been.                    There is no&#13;
&#13;
           doubt that a better education, or increased education, will&#13;
&#13;
           be the greatest help to create understanding in the possibili y&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                          26&#13;
&#13;
           of developing the country.&#13;
&#13;
                     I have said that I welcome, and I will support&#13;
&#13;
           this project.     There is only one question in my mind here.&#13;
&#13;
           Will it mean that the success of this project will particu-&#13;
&#13;
           larly depend on whether the secondary schools will get their&#13;
&#13;
           material--the youngsters--to attend the schools?&#13;
&#13;
                     And I see that in the reference on page 4 that at&#13;
&#13;
           the present time;-for '63-'64, there are just 317,000 childre&#13;
&#13;
           attending the primary schools.       And of that 317,000, a&#13;
&#13;
           little less than 16,000 will continue up to the sixth or&#13;
&#13;
           through the sixth grade.       I see on the same page, though, tha --&#13;
&#13;
           it says there     that there is planned developments to "in-&#13;
&#13;
           crease the number of children in primary schools" and it&#13;
&#13;
           is planned that they will be 900,000 by 1969.&#13;
&#13;
                     My question is:      What is this plan?   Or, are they&#13;
&#13;
           so well based that they can be relieved therefrom to&#13;
&#13;
           succeed in giving the flow of younsters into the secondary&#13;
&#13;
           schools, which we are sppporting to be built?&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank youo&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:     Tpank you, Mr. Thor.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. McMahon.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McMAHON:     Well, we didn't like this plan of&#13;
&#13;
           theirs.   It wasn't   real~y   a plan.   It is a political decision&#13;
&#13;
           to provide primary school acconunodation for all the students&#13;
&#13;
           in the country.     The Addis Ababa Conference of some years&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                  27&#13;
&#13;
           ago   put this forward.&#13;
                       We don't think it is possible for them.        We&#13;
&#13;
           didn't think--and we discussed this with them, at length--&#13;
&#13;
           we didn't think it was possible for them to increase the&#13;
&#13;
           number of pupils from 300,000 to 900,000 in the next few&#13;
&#13;
           years.     What we discussed with them; what we would like to&#13;
&#13;
           see them do, would be to go in for a much more modest            in~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           crease in the number of students, say at the most SO%,&#13;
&#13;
           but, at the same time, use the teachers that they are putting&#13;
&#13;
           out to improve the quality of students coming out from those&#13;
&#13;
           schools.&#13;
                        I think this common sense approach will probably&#13;
&#13;
           prevail in Ethiopia.        I don't think they will get the&#13;
&#13;
           students up to that number.        I think that if they accept&#13;
&#13;
           these views, that they will       produc~   from the upper levels&#13;
&#13;
           of their primary    school~    students of adequate quality to&#13;
&#13;
           come to the secondary schools that we are financing.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. THOR:    Well, yes.    But I understand the&#13;
&#13;
           project is creating a little more than 20,000 classroom&#13;
&#13;
           seats for new secondary school pupils.          It creates seats.&#13;
                               1&#13;
           For instance, in        63- 1 64 it is just over 15,000.   The&#13;
&#13;
           planning of the government is to a little less than triple&#13;
&#13;
           the enrollment into primary       schoolsr ~Triple   the 15,000 is&#13;
&#13;
           only 45,000 six gradepupils coming through the sixth&#13;
&#13;
           grade.     And if we cannot rely upon this planning of triple&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           28&#13;
&#13;
           the number, it seemed to me that it is still        questiona~&#13;
           whether it is necessary to do something for the primary&#13;
&#13;
           school system, to make sure that what we are helping to do&#13;
&#13;
           in the secondary schools will succeed in getting enough&#13;
&#13;
           material.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:      I think that if they only keep the&#13;
&#13;
           present number of students in the primary schools at&#13;
&#13;
           300,000, and if they could improve the quality of those&#13;
&#13;
           without increasing the quantity, I think the output from&#13;
&#13;
           there will be adequate for the secondary schools which are&#13;
&#13;
           planned.    Because, you see, in the secondary schools when&#13;
&#13;
           the expansion is completed there will be only 51,000&#13;
&#13;
           altogether in the secondary schools.&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, your output which--the figure you have just&#13;
&#13;
           cpoted is the output each year.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. THOR:      Yes, of course.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR~   McMAHON:     While the 51,000 is for six grades&#13;
&#13;
           in the secondary schools.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. THOR:      Oh, I   se~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:       Thank you.&#13;

                       MR. T~:        Mr. Chairman, I also strongly support&#13;
&#13;
           this project.      I think it would be of great help for the&#13;
&#13;
           economy of Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
                       I have been, also, very much impressed by the low&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            29&#13;
           cost, the estimated cost per student for construction and&#13;
&#13;
           equipment, which is about only two-thirds of the cost in&#13;
&#13;
           Morocco, which has been costed already by the Bank and IDA&#13;
&#13;
           as being rather on the low side.&#13;
&#13;
                       But in this project, I particularly welcome the&#13;
&#13;
           inclusion of the practical teacher into an institute.&#13;
&#13;
           Unless I am wrong, Mr. Chairman, I think it is the first&#13;
&#13;
           time we have included such a thing in an education project.&#13;
&#13;
           And I would like to know what--once the teachers graduated--&#13;
&#13;
           what they would do exactly?         What will be their main object?&#13;
&#13;
           What are they going to teach?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:   Where are they going to teach?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. TAZI:    What are they going to teach.&#13;

                       MR. WOODS:    What?&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Ballantine, is this the first time we have&#13;
&#13;
           had this teacher training?&#13;

                       Join us, won't you, please?&#13;
&#13;
                       Is this the first      p~oject   with this teacher&#13;
&#13;
           training?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. BALLANTINE:       No, Mr. Chairman, we did do it&#13;
&#13;
           in Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:    We did it in Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. BALLANTINE:       Yes.   I recall that one.   And the&#13;
&#13;
           may have been others. But I know we did it in Pakistan.&#13;

           respond; or Mr. McMahon?        What are these teachers expected&#13;
&#13;
           to do when they graduate?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. BALLANTINE:     Mro McMahon is the specialist&#13;
&#13;
           in this.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:    What was the second point?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:     The second point was what will these&#13;
           teachers do?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:     Oh, yes.   There are, at the present,&#13;
&#13;
           in the secondary schools, p.o~t:eachers of practical subjects.&#13;
&#13;
           This is the primary reason for these teachers, too.                The&#13;
&#13;
           secondary schools will be made into comprehensive schools,&#13;
&#13;
           including practical SGhemes of woodwork, metal work, com-&#13;
&#13;
           merce--that kind of subject; and they will teach those.&#13;
&#13;
           They will also be trained for teaching in the technical&#13;
&#13;
           institutes, which will require much more specialized tratn-&#13;
&#13;
           ing in the     engineering aspects of machine      shop work;&#13;

           welding, fitting, and allied subjects of that kind.&#13;

           Ethiopian Government is making a very thorough survey of&#13;
&#13;
           the possibilities of this region, it is estimated that&#13;
&#13;
           ~oduction   of sugar will increase by about 45,000 tons, and&#13;
&#13;
           the production of the fiber will increase by 4500 tons,&#13;
&#13;
           once the project is completed.         This will take a period, I&#13;

                         MR. WOODS:      Both?   The sugar and the sisal&#13;
&#13;
           fib~r~ t.   Both _together?&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SAMII:      Both together; yes.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. WOODS:      So it might come up in the reasonably&#13;
&#13;
           near future.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. TAZI:    May I ask does it include, also, the&#13;
&#13;
           agricultural aspect of it, or only the industrial aspect?&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SAMII:      I am quite sure, and to my knowledge,&#13;
&#13;
           both the industrial and agricultural aspect4.          It includes,&#13;
&#13;
           also, the establishment of refining, I think.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. TAZI:     I particularly welcome .that, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. WOODS:      The best witness on that, of course,&#13;
&#13;
           would be von Hoffman; and you might pursue it with him.&#13;
&#13;
                         Thank you very much. [to Mr. Samii]&#13;
&#13;
                          Mr. Suzuki.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. SUZUKI:      Mr. Chainnan, I welcome this proposed&#13;
&#13;
           IDA credit to Ethiopia; especially, the point raised by&#13;
&#13;
           some of the Executive Directors before, the building cost .&#13;
&#13;
                         Some time ago, I raised a question on this matter--&#13;
&#13;
           after observing some developing countries--that the school&#13;
&#13;
           buildings would be modest.            Now, in this case, that is the&#13;
&#13;
           thing I wanted to expect.&#13;
                         And then another point was emphasis on equipment.&#13;
&#13;
                         Now, looking at the Annex, one-third of the for eign&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           33&#13;
           exchange cost is for equipment.     I think this is a great&#13;
&#13;
           improvement.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, with regard to the practical technical teach-&#13;
&#13;
           ing institute, at first I wondered why the allocation of the&#13;
&#13;
           funds for equipment is so small.     But then I notice that&#13;
&#13;
           the U. S. Government is going to give aid.     In some cases,&#13;
&#13;
           I notice that the U. S. aid     is interested in   par~icular&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           divisions of technical training; very often, they don 1 t&#13;
&#13;
           cover all departments of technical training institutes.&#13;
&#13;
           I hope, in this case, the funds allocated to this practical&#13;
&#13;
           technical teaching institute is so small, so the U. S.&#13;
&#13;
           Government will cover Â· almost all the activities of this&#13;
&#13;
           institute.&#13;
&#13;
                        And then,now, in the case of the education in&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia, the training of teachers is very important.        And&#13;
&#13;
           in one place I noticed that the school teachers move out&#13;
&#13;
           of schools.     Now, there must be some subsidies or scholar-&#13;
&#13;
           ships, or whatever assistance, given to students going to&#13;
&#13;
           training institutes; or school teachers' schools.       I wonder&#13;
&#13;
           what kind of obligations the graduates have.       In some cases,&#13;
&#13;
           in some countries, those who go to teachers' institutes--they&#13;
&#13;
           have obligations to teach at least for the same number of&#13;
&#13;
           years in the schools, or twice as many as.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, in this paper, I didn't see any such notes.&#13;
&#13;
                        What kind of obligations are attached?&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         34&#13;
&#13;
                     And then, looking at Annex 3, in this chart there&#13;
&#13;
           is one type of institute--'erade institute--that after eight&#13;
&#13;
           years; then 9, 10, 11 years, they are supposed to become&#13;
&#13;
           artisans and craftsmen.    I don't see an explanation about&#13;
&#13;
           what are the "trade institutes."&#13;
&#13;
                     Now, from the standpoint of looking for some ways&#13;
&#13;
           to increase productivity with the country, the name&#13;
&#13;
           "trade institute 1 " or the number of years they have to&#13;
&#13;
           spend; that is, 11 years altogebher, I suppose--this seems&#13;
&#13;
           to be very important, but I couldn't see any explanation.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:     Yes, Mr. Suzuki.&#13;
&#13;
                     Will you respond to those questions, Mr. McMahon?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McMAHON:     Well, the trade training, we are&#13;
&#13;
           attaching to two of the secondary schools--special facili-&#13;
&#13;
           ties for the training on a part-time day and evening basis&#13;
&#13;
           of trades people.&#13;
                     MR. SUZUKI:     Now, that is trade extension in that&#13;
&#13;
           one.   But this is a different one.    In the trade extension&#13;
&#13;
           they also have some explanation--about trade extension.&#13;
&#13;
           But this is not that.     It is "trade institutes."     The same&#13;
&#13;
           thing, or different?&#13;
                      MR. McMAHON:    It is the same thing.      We have, on&#13;
&#13;
            these two schools, these two secondary schools, general&#13;
&#13;
           secondary schools, special facilities which have been put&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                             35&#13;
           on to provide training for craftsmen and artisans on a&#13;
&#13;
           part-time day and evening basis.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     So it's the same thing.     Where is&#13;
&#13;
           the "extension," Mr. Suzuki?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SUZUKI:    Well, "trade extension," there is&#13;
&#13;
           explanation some place.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. KNAPP:     Paragraph 55.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SUZUKI:     Yes; 55, "Trade Extensions at Two&#13;
&#13;
           Secondary Schoolso 11     Is that--&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Is that the same thing?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     Yes; this is the same thing.     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SUZUKI:     That is trade extension.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     On the question of the teachers'&#13;
&#13;
           responsibility after training, there is no formal agreement&#13;
&#13;
           between the    training teachers and the government that they&#13;
&#13;
           will continue in teaching afterwards.       They have no such&#13;
&#13;
           bonding arrangements, and they don't want to put on bonding&#13;
&#13;
           arrangements at present.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Generally speaking, do you think it's&#13;
&#13;
           good practice to have these arrangements--that they will&#13;
&#13;
           continue?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     I don't think so.   I have experienced&#13;
&#13;
           these in one college in which I have been, in Iraq, and I&#13;
&#13;
           think it is a bum method.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                  36&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Urn-hum.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     I think they should put on proper&#13;
&#13;
           salary scales to attract teachers and keep them there.             I&#13;
&#13;
           think the   ~ bonding   is a bum method.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Urn-hum.&#13;
&#13;
                       Does that completely respond to you, Mr. Suzuki?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. SUZUKI:     Well, apparently, in developing coun-&#13;
&#13;
           tries, it is hard to raise the salaries of the school teach-&#13;
&#13;
           ers, it is hard to make it attractive. So, instead, they&#13;
&#13;
           include   goo~materials     from villages and towns, and then&#13;
&#13;
           give scholarships, and then they keep them in the teaching&#13;
&#13;
           profession for some years.          I noticed that this is quite&#13;
&#13;
           often done in many developing countries, even in Southeast&#13;
&#13;
           Asia.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS.:    It is an interesting point.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Rajan.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR.   RAJAN~   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                       I, too, join my colleagues in giving my warm sup-&#13;
&#13;
           port to this project.&#13;
&#13;
                       As was brought out in reply to Dr. Donner's ques-&#13;
&#13;
           tion, and it is made in the technical report, it is particu-&#13;
&#13;
           larly refreshing that the Ethiopian Government prefer the&#13;
&#13;
           most economic and minimum standards of buildings.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                             37&#13;
&#13;
                      I would just invite your reference to parao 70&#13;
&#13;
           of the technical report, in which it says, "Tendering is&#13;
&#13;
           usually public and advertised in the local papers; for the&#13;
&#13;
           proposed project the government will invite international&#13;
&#13;
           bidding for the supply of imported apparatus and equipment,&#13;
&#13;
           but because of the wide variation in conditions at the 78&#13;
&#13;
           building sites of the project, it will probably be advisable&#13;
&#13;
           to award contracts for the construction of buildings to&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopian contractors experienced in local conditions."&#13;
&#13;
                      Sir, I should have thought this is an eminently&#13;
&#13;
           suitable project in which local contractors really should&#13;
&#13;
           have been asked to bid.     Because, as the technical report&#13;
&#13;
           finds out, there are many large public--private and public&#13;
&#13;
           buildings in Addis Ababa of an excellent        standard â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢   There&#13;
&#13;
           is no dearth of experienced contractors.       And I do wish&#13;
&#13;
           that the staff may not have been so apologetic about it,&#13;
&#13;
           particularly when the cost estimates are so low, and the&#13;
&#13;
           buildings are being constructed at such minimum standards.&#13;
&#13;
                      I would now come to another point, on the .consulE-&#13;
&#13;
           ants8 fees.    I believe the consultants will be mainly the&#13;
&#13;
           architects .   It is quoted at $920,000, which, considering&#13;
&#13;
           that the total cost of building is only about $6oS million,&#13;
&#13;
           seems 1 j:o beÂ·_.somewhat on the high side.   And when we are&#13;
&#13;
           adopting minimum standards of construction, and using local&#13;
&#13;
           material and local contractors, I do not know whether it is&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         38&#13;
&#13;
           necessary to engage such highly costly, and highly priced&#13;
&#13;
           consultants.     I would like an explanation on this.&#13;
&#13;
                     And, also, I would make a reference to parao 61,&#13;
&#13;
           in which it is stated that "It is probably that an architect&#13;
&#13;
           may be available through bilateral aid from the Swedish&#13;
&#13;
           government        "   If so, there should be a saving in&#13;
&#13;
           respect to this item.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:     Yes, Mr. Rajan.&#13;
                        Would you respond to those last two questions?&#13;
&#13;
                        The first is an observation by Mr. Rajan.     But the&#13;
&#13;
           two questions are clear questions.&#13;
&#13;
                        Mr. McMAHON:     Yes.&#13;
                        Well, the architect,which is coming on bilateral&#13;
&#13;
           aid from the Swedish Government, will be attached to the&#13;
&#13;
           project unit in the Ministry.        And he will act as the&#13;
&#13;
           client's architect; that is to say, he will make sure that&#13;
&#13;
           the drawings .w hich are put forward to the Minis try are&#13;
&#13;
           suitable for the requirements of the schools.        He will work&#13;
&#13;
           with the project manager in supervising the consultants.&#13;
&#13;
                        On the question of the consultants' fees, I have&#13;
&#13;
           dealt with these partly.        I was advised by our architects&#13;
&#13;
           that the normal fee, based on building costs, would be&#13;
&#13;
           about 15%, and this--        What we have done is to take an over-&#13;
&#13;
           all 10% of the project, which is roughly the same figure.&#13;
&#13;
           It may be a little high.        But, as I say, for the very&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            39&#13;
           spread-out nature of the buildings, the amount of super-&#13;
&#13;
           vision which will be required--for example, some schools--&#13;
&#13;
           It took me two days to inspect one school.        I had to fly&#13;
&#13;
           there, inspect the school, and wait for the airplane to&#13;
&#13;
           cane back the next day. This, of course, if an arthitect&#13;
&#13;
           is going out to inspect the schools, and certify work,&#13;
&#13;
           will amount to a great deal of time in the end.         It is a very&#13;
&#13;
           unusual country.      Transportation is limited, very limited&#13;
&#13;
           indeed.     And I think the costs of these fees, the costs of&#13;
&#13;
           supervision, will be quite high, and might well come to the&#13;
&#13;
           figure we have quoted.         We felt we should play safe here and&#13;
&#13;
           make sure they had enough money to cover fees.         If they can&#13;
&#13;
           do it for less, then we shall be very happy.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:   Thank you.&#13;

           favor of this project, too.         It sounds very reasonable.     It&#13;
&#13;
           is not too costly and not to cheap, apparently.&#13;
&#13;
                        I think, really, that all the questions I would&#13;
&#13;
           have liked to ask have already been asked; so I have just&#13;
&#13;
           one left.     That is the question of the geographical implanta-&#13;
&#13;
           tion of these schools.&#13;
                        I see, in paragraph 57, that:      "31 secondary&#13;
&#13;
           schools and one primary teacher training institute are&#13;
&#13;
           situated in areas of low population density" and, according&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                40&#13;
           to this, "student hostels are therefore proposed for these."&#13;
&#13;
                      I see, too, of course, at the beginning of this&#13;
&#13;
           report, in the summary--that 1 s number iii :.: of' theÂ·   Sl3mlll~ry--&#13;
&#13;
           Where is it?    Here it is. Yes.       That:    "Hostel accommodation&#13;
&#13;
           for about 5% of all students has been included at 32 schools&#13;
&#13;
           after careful study of their geographical location in relatio&#13;
&#13;
           to catchment area."&#13;
&#13;
                      I understand perfectly that it could be necessary&#13;
&#13;
           to have a larger dispersion in the spreading of schools,&#13;
&#13;
           in order to meet the students where they are.           But if there&#13;
&#13;
           is a necessity, nevertheless, to build hostels to accommoda)be&#13;
&#13;
           them, is this large dispersion so necessary; as much neces-&#13;
&#13;
           sary as it could appear the first time?&#13;
&#13;
                      That's my question.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                      Would you respond to that?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McMAHON:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                      Well, there are some areas which have a rather&#13;
&#13;
           sparsely populated population there.           And you have got two&#13;
&#13;
           options:   Ymu'_,reither leave them without a school; or put a&#13;
&#13;
           school there with boarding facilities.&#13;
&#13;
                      If you put boarding facilities, it means that            ~ou&#13;
&#13;
           can collect enough students to fill the school.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. MALAPLATE:     Yes, I understand this.         But was&#13;
&#13;
           it necessary?&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   41&#13;
                             If we are looking at the map now, at the end of&#13;
&#13;
           the report, we will see that the students are very dispersed&#13;
&#13;
           in the country.           Could it not have been possible--if there&#13;
&#13;
           is in any way a necessity to board the students--to put them&#13;
&#13;
           closer to a town, or in a city or--              I see, for example&#13;
&#13;
           that you are constructing, I think, a new general school in&#13;
&#13;
           a small city called "Gid&lt;!ile!.P--I don't know how it is pro-&#13;
&#13;
           munced in Amharic or in the local language.               Number 36&#13;
&#13;
           at the end, at the south of the map.              And you will build a&#13;
&#13;
           new general school here, with a hostel, and you have ruready;&#13;
&#13;
           or, you will build at the same time in Arba Minch, a little&#13;
                            0-&#13;
           northea:t at this same location, at about 50 kilometers,&#13;
           at about 30 miles north of that, another school.                You will&#13;
&#13;
            extend a senior-junior Â·school.           I wonder what a "senior-&#13;
&#13;
            junior" school. is.           Do you have an answer to this?&#13;
&#13;
            Is that a senior-junior high school with a hostel              ~coommmda-&#13;
&#13;
            tion.          Both locations are close together.       Is it necessary&#13;
&#13;
            to have a school at           the place, and another higher school&#13;
&#13;
            at   ~;.:t   ;p l,. aÂ·c.: e so close; and not have all the school communi t&#13;
&#13;
            at the same place in the same area, particularly if the cost&#13;
&#13;
            of s upervision is so high?&#13;
                             MR. McMAHON:    This was considered in relation to&#13;
&#13;
            the cost of the project.            Your point is whether it would be&#13;
&#13;
            better to have those two schools on one site, and increase&#13;
&#13;
            the boarding facilitieso&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                               42&#13;
&#13;
                       In fact, in this case, it is cheaper to put up&#13;
&#13;
           a new junior secondary school, so as to collect the&#13;
&#13;
           students.    You can get a much larger proportion of day&#13;
&#13;
           students attending in the day.        You see, we have only got&#13;
&#13;
           5% of all students in boarding       facilities~    and boarding&#13;
&#13;
           facilities are quite expensive to run on a recurring basiso&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. MALAPLATE ~     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       MRo McMAHON:      It is cheaper; ". l:hoggh we have con-&#13;
&#13;
           sidered in many cases whether it is better to put all in&#13;
&#13;
           one school; or, in some cases, to have them separated.             .And,&#13;
&#13;
           there, it was a case for separation.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. MALAPLATE:     .And in the case, for example, of&#13;
&#13;
           this school in Neghelli--that is more south--in which case&#13;
&#13;
           you are building a       new juniorschool with a hostel--was&#13;
                                r&#13;
&#13;
           it necessary to'"do':that, sinbe. "it.1 iS._such a small part of&#13;
&#13;
           the students which will have to be brought here, 5%?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McMAHON:      It is 5% over-all.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. MALAPLATE:      Over-all.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:      Over-all; right through.     .And, of&#13;
&#13;
           course, some schools will have more than 5%.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. MALAPLATE:      In other words, we cannot suppose&#13;
&#13;
           that in any school half of the pupilfs will be boarded?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:      I donrt think they will ever reach&#13;
&#13;
           that proportion of half; no.&#13;
&#13;
                       There was also, in some cases, I might say, a&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                              43&#13;
&#13;
           little political pressure to put the schools in certain&#13;
&#13;
           places.    Not very much of this, but there was some of this, o&#13;
&#13;
           which i think we had to take account--about four or five&#13;
&#13;
           schools were in this category.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. MALAPLATE:     Thank you for that concession.&#13;
&#13;
                       [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. WOODS:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       Any other Director?&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Reid.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. REID:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                       I would , ai.so ~- !ike to support this national&#13;
&#13;
           project.    So many points have been covered; and the only&#13;
&#13;
           one that is bothering me is the point that the success of&#13;
&#13;
           the project will depend very much on the quality of the&#13;
&#13;
           primary school graduates.&#13;
&#13;
                       I am a bit concerned that if the government does&#13;
&#13;
           go ahead with its intention to triple the number of primary&#13;
&#13;
           school enrollees, the quality of the graduates from the&#13;
&#13;
           primary schools may decline or maybe not improve.          On the&#13;
&#13;
           other hand, the government's desire to triple the primary&#13;
&#13;
           school enrollment, which would still only bring it up to 28%,&#13;
&#13;
           is a very understandable objective.&#13;
&#13;
                       I was wondering whether there are any      a1~     agencies&#13;
&#13;
           involved in assisting the primary schools in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Are there, Mr. McMahon?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McMAHON:     No; nothing very much.    A little&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                   44&#13;
&#13;
           UNICEF, . particularly on the teacher training side, of&#13;
&#13;
           course.   They are providing staff for the primary teacher&#13;
&#13;
           training colleges--UNESCO/UNICEF; But nothing for certain&#13;
&#13;
           in primary schoolso&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. WOODS:        Nothing in particular.&#13;
&#13;
                        I wonder whether they will be getting aid from&#13;
&#13;
           anybody else, or whether they wouldn't. : Mr.        Rei.c;l,~   your&#13;
&#13;
           point, if I understand you correctly, is that with such&#13;
&#13;
           a mushrooming in the number of primary school students,&#13;
&#13;
           would there be perhaps some falling off in the quality.&#13;
&#13;
                        Have you any point you would like to express on&#13;
&#13;
           that, Mr. McMahon?&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo McMAHON:     We discussed this point with the&#13;
&#13;
           administration officials out       th~e.   They have hetween--&#13;
&#13;
           There are two factors:        there is the political factor to&#13;
&#13;
           provide every one with primary education, which is under-&#13;
&#13;
           standable.     And there is another point, about the quality&#13;
&#13;
           of the students going down, if they do put all these numbers&#13;
&#13;
           of people in.&#13;
&#13;
                        We hope that common sense will prevail, and that&#13;
&#13;
           they will compromise here and keep the numbers down to&#13;
&#13;
           something reasonable; and only expand their primary schools&#13;
&#13;
           as good trained teachers become availableo           We tried to&#13;
&#13;
           impress this upon them.&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo   WOODS~   I am afraid your question, Mro Reid, is&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                      45&#13;
&#13;
           one of those imponderables.       I don't know how it can be&#13;
&#13;
           answered.     Certainly, the desire and intention of the&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopian Government to provide wider facilities for&#13;
&#13;
           primary education is not only laudable, but ft is highly&#13;
&#13;
           desirable.     And the secondary system has to be enlarged.&#13;
&#13;
           I suppose there might be some by-product result of a lower&#13;
&#13;
           caliber.    But, if the primary school sys tern gets on a good&#13;
&#13;
           working basis, with good teachers, the opposite might also&#13;
&#13;
           be the resulto&#13;
&#13;
                        Have you anything else?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. REID :   Well, Mr. Chairman, it may raise the&#13;
&#13;
           general point about the emphasis-f ...    tbat,~ - reiat.ive       emphasis&#13;
&#13;
            should be placed on the     ptimary~ l.ev.el,   â&#128;¢alid: ::-   C)     t..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            the seronda ry level; that, there may be a danger of an&#13;
&#13;
           unbalance arising if perhaps sufficient attention is not&#13;
&#13;
           paid--not to increase the amount of the primary level, but&#13;
&#13;
            the caliber of the primary students.            And it may be that&#13;
&#13;
           it is just a question of how much foreign assistance from&#13;
&#13;
           multilateral and bilateral agencies should be directed to&#13;
&#13;
            the primary sector compared to the secondary sector.&#13;
&#13;
           And by "foreign assistance," I mean technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
            as well as construction costso&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:    It is a perfectly good question.&#13;
&#13;
                        Of course, we can't very well control what the&#13;
&#13;
            bilateral people are going to do.         In fact, we don't have&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           46&#13;
&#13;
           anything much to say about anything except what we do in this&#13;
&#13;
           Board Room.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, we have crossed the bridge, very recently,&#13;
&#13;
           in the staff level, of going forward faster in 1966 than we&#13;
&#13;
           did in 1965 in the matter of teacher training.      We have&#13;
&#13;
           "lowered," shall I say, Mr. Ballantine, a few of the hurdles&#13;
&#13;
           that our educational division had.      So that, to the extent&#13;
&#13;
           we may, in our small but nevertheless sincere way, participate&#13;
&#13;
           in approaching the problem you [to Mr. Reid] touch on, we&#13;
&#13;
           will be providing facilities to a greater extent.      There will&#13;
&#13;
           be more projects on teacher training in the upcoming year&#13;
&#13;
           than there have been in the past year.      It is a whoihly other&#13;
&#13;
           area, and I don't think, yet, we have got enough experience&#13;
&#13;
           in what we    rn ve set out to do to rn ve a broad discussion&#13;
           among ourselves in this area.     We started just about two&#13;
&#13;
           years ago--in March--to get into this educational area to a&#13;
                                       not&#13;
           greater extent, and we were/beginning to effectively partici-&#13;
&#13;
           pate in it for another six months; so that brought it to&#13;
&#13;
           September, a year ago last September.      So we have been&#13;
&#13;
           operating really for about a year,      or a little more than a&#13;
&#13;
           year, and I don't know how Mr. Knapp feels (he will speak&#13;
&#13;
           for himself), or Mr. Aldewereld; or Mr. Ballantine, who is&#13;
&#13;
           the Head of our Educational Division in the Projects Depart-&#13;
&#13;
           ment, but I have a feeling at least another year ought to go&#13;
&#13;
            by before we get into a broad general discussion about&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         47&#13;
&#13;
           enlarging our area of activity.&#13;
&#13;
                     In the first instance--for the benefit of Mr. Reid,&#13;
&#13;
           and others who weren't at this table two years ago--we&#13;
&#13;
           deliberately, and after discussion (and it was quite a&#13;
&#13;
           unanimity on this point), came to the conclusion that primary&#13;
&#13;
           education was not for us; it was the job of the country&#13;
&#13;
           itself, with such assistance as it could get bilaterally,&#13;
              from&#13;
           or/other multilateral agencieso But primary education, we&#13;
&#13;
           concluded, as far as the beginning of our program with&#13;
&#13;
           respect to educational facilities, was not an area for the&#13;
&#13;
           World Bank.   If the country itself, through its own taxing&#13;
&#13;
           and other money-raising activities, couldn't provide primary&#13;
&#13;
           education, why, certainly, we didnRt want to get in it.&#13;
&#13;
           And I don't think we were at a point of varying that.&#13;
&#13;
                     But your point [Mr. Reid's] is well-taken.     We&#13;
&#13;
           are going to be doing more in the matter of teachers, and&#13;
&#13;
           teachers are available for both primary and secondary, and&#13;
&#13;
           other levels of educationo&#13;
&#13;
                     Would you add anything to that, Mr. Knapp?&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. KNAPP:   No; I don't think so.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think we have got all we can chew at the moment&#13;
&#13;
           in the areas we have selected out for specilization.&#13;
&#13;
                     MRo WOODS~   I thought we ought to operate for at&#13;
&#13;
           least two years, ru.d maybe three years, to get a little&#13;
&#13;
           experience.   Since we have really been at this, at the end&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           48&#13;
&#13;
           of 1964, we have accumulated a very considerable amount of&#13;
&#13;
           experience.       And the discussions in the staff--various&#13;
&#13;
           alternatives in connection with various problems--are much&#13;
&#13;
           better informed, and much more sophisticated than they were&#13;
&#13;
           two or three years ago.&#13;
&#13;
                       Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, Dro Lieftinck.&#13;
&#13;
                       DR.    LIEFTINCK~   Mr. Chairman, I apologize for the&#13;
&#13;
           second turn.       But I would like to state that I had originally&#13;
&#13;
           the same question as Mro Reid raised.        And I felt that it&#13;
&#13;
           would be very difficult for the authorities to reach their&#13;
&#13;
           goal of increasing the number of primary pupils from 300,000&#13;
&#13;
           to 900,000 in the period of '65 to '69.        But I was very&#13;
&#13;
           much satisfied by the last sentence of paragraph 38, on&#13;
&#13;
           page 10 of tre technical report, where the staff makes a&#13;
&#13;
           rather courageous and blunt statement:        "Output of teachers&#13;
&#13;
           from existing training institutes during 1965-69 is expected&#13;
&#13;
           to be only 3,330; this falls so far short of requirements tha&#13;
&#13;
           full implementation of the government's policy is unrealistic.&#13;
&#13;
           A wiser policy is for an expansion in primary school teacher&#13;
&#13;
           training to which would be geared an expansion of primary&#13;
&#13;
           schools."&#13;
&#13;
                       I think that is exactly the point that should have&#13;
&#13;
           been made by the staff, and I fully agree.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. WOODS:     Thank you, Dr. Lieftinck.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY C NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                               49&#13;
&#13;
                            Mr. Merchant.&#13;
&#13;
                            MR. MERCHANT:   I am happy to participate in&#13;
&#13;
           approving this, Mr. Chairman.          I ask a question just out of&#13;
&#13;
           rurios:i:tY".Â·    I have noted, and I think it has been corrnnented&#13;
&#13;
           on, that the IDA credit in this case includes not only the&#13;
                                                           IJNC'iM)&#13;
           entire/foreign exchange component in the/project, but half&#13;
                   J&#13;
&#13;
           of the local currency expenditures entailed.           And the ques-&#13;
&#13;
            tion I ask, for information, is whether IDA has had sufficient&#13;
&#13;
           experience yet in financing educational projects            as to&#13;
&#13;
           find a general pattern or a tendency to necessarily meet&#13;
&#13;
           at least a portion of the local currency expenditures in s uch&#13;
&#13;
           projects, possibly by reason of the fact that the&#13;
&#13;
           most urgent and meritorious projects in this field may&#13;
&#13;
           well appear in countries where the per capita income is&#13;
&#13;
           relatively low, and the difficulty in mobilizing resources,&#13;
&#13;
           indigenous resources through taxation and so forth, places&#13;
&#13;
           very serious limits on the capabilities of the government&#13;
&#13;
            in question to embark on educational programs of a scope&#13;
&#13;
           and character which are obviously required for the develop-&#13;
&#13;
           ment of the country.&#13;
&#13;
                            Is this a tendency that seems to be a pattern?&#13;
&#13;
                            MR. WOODS:   That's an interesting point, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Merchant.&#13;
&#13;
                            Mr. Knapp and I have been discussing ito     I think&#13;
&#13;
           cr   would say we haven't got a pattern, as yet.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                              50&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Knapp, would you respond to this?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. KNAPP:      Well, I would like to start by&#13;
&#13;
           saying, of course, we don't like to finance local expendi-&#13;
&#13;
           ture on anything in any country unless there is a demon-&#13;
&#13;
           str~tion   in the country of a really good fiscal effort.         So&#13;
&#13;
            that's the starting point.&#13;
&#13;
                       Then, when you get on to looking at the projects,&#13;
&#13;
           I think we have found in the educational field that the edu-&#13;
&#13;
           cational budgets in these countries, and especially in the&#13;
&#13;
           poorer countries, tend to lay a pretty heavy burden; and it&#13;
&#13;
           encourages us to be sympathetic, if there was some basic&#13;
&#13;
           underlying fiscal performance, to help them in this area&#13;
&#13;
           by moving up toward figures of say 60/a.          In this case,&#13;
&#13;
            two-thirds--66 2/3's--is frankly on the high side.&#13;
&#13;
                        But a very poor country, and very heavy budgetary&#13;
&#13;
           problems, and a good fiscal effort.&#13;
&#13;
                        But I wouldn't say we have a formula to it.          It is&#13;
&#13;
           kind of looking at it .case by case in terms of, first, the&#13;
&#13;
            over-all pattern of the country's requirements; and then the&#13;
&#13;
            project basis.&#13;
&#13;
                        MRo MERCHANT:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. WOODS:   Thank you, Mr. Knapp.&#13;

&#13;
                     Thank you, gentlemen.     This resolution is adopted.&#13;
&#13;
                     I must say that it is very welcome, indeed, to&#13;
&#13;
           have this evidence of the care and thoughtfulness with which&#13;
&#13;
           the Directors have examined this document in connection&#13;
&#13;
           with this project on education.&#13;
&#13;
                      The Directors--in meeting, and     discussing, ~ .and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           asking questions, and finally approving or disapproving&#13;
&#13;
           these projects--perform a function that is necessary in&#13;
&#13;
           that regard.   But there is a very important periphery&#13;
&#13;
           function that is performed as a result of this type of dis-&#13;
&#13;
           cussion,uwhich is pretty clear evidence to the members of&#13;
&#13;
           the staff that their papers ought to be in good shape.       And I&#13;
&#13;
           am grateful for the extensive comment and the number of&#13;
&#13;
           questions this morning, which, without exception, indicated&#13;
&#13;
           a very real familiarity with the document.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think, perhaps--as was the case with me--this&#13;
&#13;
           education thing is still one of these that we are making&#13;
&#13;
           precedents on all the time.      But, thank you very much for&#13;

            Transcript of meeting of the Executive
            Directors of the IDA held on February 15, 1966
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The recommendation with respect to
            development credits for Ethiopia, which is the principal
            reason for the meeting this morning. The education credit is
            the second credit to Ethiopia and, together with the highway
            credit of 1963, will increase our total commitment to about
            $21 million as compared with total Bank loans of about $57
            million. In the past Bank financing has been repeatedly
            channeled into highway construction and telecommunications,
            with a small amount to the Development Bank of Ethiopia. The
            present education project and the prospective agricultural
            credit project and a water and sewage project for the city
            of Addis Ababa will certainly be welcome additions to the
            areas with which we have been associated with in the past
            and most likely will continue to be associated in the
            future. Bank pointed out that Ethiopia's performance in
            certain sector such as exports, transport and power, has
            been satisfactory. Perhaps most important, in the long run,
            are arrangements presently under negotiation with AID for an
            agro industrial survey for identification and preparation of
            projects. These are some of the indications that greater
            efforts are being made by the Ethiopian and outside agencies
            in the preparation of projects that might lead to higher
            levels of investment in the near future.
