&#13;
             MS. PIERCY:   Thank you.     I want to apologize for&#13;
&#13;
 the chair being a little bit late starting the meeting.         I&#13;
&#13;
 realized, like others, we were notified this morning that&#13;
&#13;
 we need to respond by 4 p.m. today on a no-objection basis&#13;
&#13;
 to the delay of one week in circulation of the Western&#13;
&#13;
 China Poverty Project Management Response, so we had to&#13;
&#13;
 get that in under the wire--but since it is a no-objection&#13;
&#13;
 basis, and it is my understanding that the Secretariat has&#13;
&#13;
 polled all the offices and there are no objections, so I&#13;
&#13;
 think we can assume that that delay will in fact be&#13;
&#13;
 approved.    So those are just the late-breaking&#13;
&#13;
 developments here.&#13;
&#13;
             The first item on our agenda today is discussion&#13;
&#13;
 of the draft paper, "Social Sector Protection Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy - From Safety Net to Spring Board."        This, you&#13;
&#13;
 will recall, was postponed from our May 8th meeting.&#13;
&#13;
             The CODE Subcommittee had an upstream&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, people will recall, when it was at the concept&#13;
&#13;
 stage in July of last year, as well as an informal&#13;
&#13;
 discussion--I think this was without a staff presentation-&#13;
&#13;
 -on the draft SSP in early May of this year, and I think&#13;
&#13;
 you will recall a summary of that May 3rd discussion which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           4&#13;
&#13;
 was circulated by Myles Wickstead by email to all CODE&#13;
&#13;
 members, and you will have seen my email suggesting that&#13;
&#13;
 we might want to focus our discussion today on the&#13;
&#13;
 following issues--first--and I repeat here, just for the&#13;
&#13;
 benefit of all of us being on the same page--the&#13;
&#13;
 incorporation of the entire social sector family in the&#13;
&#13;
 preparation and implementation of the Strategy; second,&#13;
&#13;
 the definition of social protection, and do we in fact all&#13;
&#13;
 have the same working definition and expectations on&#13;
&#13;
 social protection; third, the nature of and early results&#13;
&#13;
 from the evaluation of social funds; fourth, selectivity&#13;
&#13;
 and the selection of countries on which the Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 should focus if indeed we agree on a country selectivity&#13;
&#13;
 approach.&#13;
&#13;
             With that as backdrop, I'd like to turn to&#13;
&#13;
 Messrs. Holzmann and Jorgensen to present the Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy, and then we'll open the floor for a discussion&#13;
&#13;
 of these issues, as well as any additional issues that&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues may want to raise.       And let me at this point&#13;
&#13;
 acknowledge and very much appreciate the circulation of&#13;
&#13;
 comments from some chairs which preceded the meeting.      I&#13;
&#13;
 think that has probably helped the presenters as well to&#13;
&#13;
 get an indication of where we would like to focus.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               5&#13;
&#13;
             We also have a second item on the agenda today,&#13;
&#13;
 so just to give us a time frame, I am hoping that we might&#13;
&#13;
 be able to conclude this discussion by 4:30, unless we get&#13;
&#13;
 into issues that seem much larger, because we do then need&#13;
&#13;
 to take some time to review the OP/BP 2.30, Development&#13;
&#13;
 Assistance and Conflict.&#13;
&#13;
             With that, let me turn it over to you.       Thank&#13;
&#13;
 you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. HOLZMANN:   Mr. Doryan, who is the Vice&#13;
&#13;
 President for HD, is going to make the introduction.&#13;
&#13;
             MS. PIERCY:   I am sorry I didn't recognize your&#13;
&#13;
 presence.&#13;
&#13;
             Welcome.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. DORYAN:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             The team here, as you mentioned, Madam Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
 is headed by Robert Holzmann and Steve Jorgensen, and they&#13;
&#13;
 will do a much more thorough presentation.          We also have&#13;
&#13;
 here the team from the Social Sector Board--Alan Ruby,&#13;
&#13;
 Director for HD in East Asia; Michal Rutkowski, the Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Manager for ECA; Ana-Maria Arriagada, the Sector Manager&#13;
&#13;
 in LAC; Laura Fringenti, the alternative Sector Board&#13;
&#13;
 member for Africa; and Zafiris Tzannatos, the Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Manager in MENA.&#13;

&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           6&#13;
&#13;
           Let me make a few comments to start.     There is&#13;
&#13;
 one relevant issue at hand, and that is to define the&#13;
&#13;
 nature of the strategy we are dealing with today.     Is it&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's social strategy, or is it the Bank's social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy?&#13;
&#13;
           The answer to this bedrock question is essential&#13;
&#13;
 in order to have a common language during the discussions&#13;
&#13;
 this afternoon.   The premise from which the social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy was built is the latter and not the&#13;
&#13;
 former.   It is the whole Bank social protection strategy,&#13;
&#13;
 not the whole Bank social strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Now I will address three more specific issues&#13;
&#13;
 about a set of tradeoffs that have to be taken into&#13;
&#13;
 account and that define how selective or not we are in the&#13;
&#13;
 proposed strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           What are some of those three tradeoffs?     First,&#13;
&#13;
 is the strategy the minimum common denominator of the&#13;
&#13;
 conceptual and operational understanding that exists in&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and elsewhere, where it tries to push the&#13;
&#13;
 conceptual framework to be state of the art in thinking?&#13;
&#13;
 In this case, the latter was the decision, or at least,&#13;
&#13;
 that is what we wanted--propose a challenging and robust&#13;
&#13;
 conceptual framework to thread together pensions, labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                7&#13;
&#13;
 markets, social funds, social assistance, et cetera, into&#13;
&#13;
 a story called social protection.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, is the strategy like a big bag, where a&#13;
&#13;
 set of other issues not yet fully addressed in other&#13;
&#13;
 strategies are put into it, or is the strategy focused in&#13;
&#13;
 one area of thinking and policy such as social protection&#13;
&#13;
 and using a strong conceptual underpinning, social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management, concentrates on it?        The latter is our case.&#13;
&#13;
 However, there is a careful, short but clear mention of&#13;
&#13;
 how this is embedded in the global discussion of social&#13;
&#13;
 policy, on PRSP, on CDF, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
           And third and finally, does the strategy once&#13;
&#13;
 focus in one area, social protection, take sides from the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning in favor of a subset of instruments and&#13;
&#13;
 institutions, or does it seek to identify the most&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate mix in each country context?            The latter is&#13;
&#13;
 the case with this strategy, where informal, market-based,&#13;
&#13;
 and public arrangements are put under the lens of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction and supporting economic development in each&#13;
&#13;
 country context.&#13;
&#13;
           The word "spring board" from the title on is&#13;
&#13;
 intended precisely to show the dynamics of creating&#13;
&#13;
 inclusive societies that can prevent, mitigate, and cope&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  8&#13;
&#13;
 with risks.   Those societies can organize in order to&#13;
&#13;
 achieve their goals.&#13;
&#13;
            I thought that these few comments would be of&#13;
&#13;
 use to initiate later on the discussion, but let me pass&#13;
&#13;
 now to Robert Holzmann.&#13;
&#13;
            MS. PIERCY:   Might I ask if that's available in&#13;
&#13;
 writing?   I think it might be useful for our future&#13;
&#13;
 reference as well, and I really thank you for that very&#13;
&#13;
 sharp delineation of the context.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. DORYAN:   Sure.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. HOLZMANN:   Madam Chairperson, ladies and&#13;
&#13;
 gentlemen, thank you for giving us the opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
 discuss this Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper here&#13;
&#13;
 at CODE.   I would like to thank all of the EDs for their&#13;
&#13;
 comments and the encouragement received.           The SP family is&#13;
&#13;
 thankful and is looking forward to the discussion, as you&#13;
&#13;
 can see from the large representation of the regional&#13;
&#13;
 members of the family.     I am also thankful that the acting&#13;
&#13;
 heads of the Poverty and Social Development Group could&#13;
&#13;
 not make it to the meeting, because since the very&#13;
&#13;
 beginning, we had close interactions with their groups on&#13;
&#13;
 the Sector Strategy Paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           9&#13;
&#13;
             I would like to make three remarks in my opening&#13;
&#13;
 statement, one on the new definition of SP and the&#13;
&#13;
 underlying concept of social risk management, one on the&#13;
&#13;
 process, and one on strategic conclusions, and as always,&#13;
&#13;
 I will do the presentation and Steen will answer the&#13;
&#13;
 questions.    That's the way we organized it.&#13;
&#13;
             On the definition and concept, SP is a family at&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank, a new one, coming together only in late 1996,&#13;
&#13;
 which is traditionally defined as programs, social&#13;
&#13;
 insurance, labor market, intervention, social safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
 Traditions and abstract goals are important but&#13;
&#13;
 insufficient to base a strategy on which should be&#13;
&#13;
 operational while providing a breakthrough in the fight&#13;
&#13;
 against poverty.&#13;
&#13;
             For this reason, a new conceptual framework was&#13;
&#13;
 developed which includes what was traditionally understood&#13;
&#13;
 by SP but goes beyond.     First, it takes account of a&#13;
&#13;
 dynamic view of poverty which is linked with vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
 and risk.    Second, it sees the poor as much more exposed&#13;
&#13;
 to diverse risk while at the same time having the least&#13;
&#13;
 instruments to manage them.      And thirdly, it attempts to&#13;
&#13;
 address the causes as well as the symptoms of risk in&#13;
&#13;
 order to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            10&#13;
&#13;
             This thinking builds on the goals set out in the&#13;
&#13;
 Copenhagen Declaration and is in line with similar&#13;
&#13;
 concepts developed inside and outside the UN System,&#13;
&#13;
 namely, sustainable livelihood.        The new definition and&#13;
&#13;
 the underlying concept, social risk management, helps&#13;
&#13;
 merge the best which social and economic science have to&#13;
&#13;
 offer to effectively address poverty.&#13;
&#13;
             As you know since you have read the paper, the&#13;
&#13;
 new definition defines "social protection" as "public&#13;
&#13;
 intervention that assists individuals, households and&#13;
&#13;
 communities better manage risk, that provides support for&#13;
&#13;
 the critically poor."     This definition is, for example,&#13;
&#13;
 echoed in an issues paper on social protection produced&#13;
&#13;
 for DFID.    Similarly, the Development Committee in April&#13;
&#13;
 this year endorsed the issue of social protection&#13;
&#13;
 discussing progress in the new financial architecture.&#13;
&#13;
 This demonstrated a new definition and the concept had&#13;
&#13;
 become embraced by economists, social scientists and&#13;
&#13;
 policymakers dealing with SP inside and outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
             Second, on the process, the Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 Paper is the result of an interactive process among the&#13;
&#13;
 Network anchor and the regional staff, other Bank sectors,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         11&#13;
&#13;
 and external international partners over the last 20&#13;
&#13;
 months.&#13;
&#13;
           First, close consultation and presentation at&#13;
&#13;
 the respective Sector Boards were held with poverty,&#13;
&#13;
 social development, and gender boards, which received each&#13;
&#13;
 subsequent draft for review.      This draft was sent for&#13;
&#13;
 review, and written comments to related sectors,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly financial sector, public sector, and&#13;
&#13;
 infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, the preparation of the Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 Paper coincided with the drafting of the World Development&#13;
&#13;
 Report 2000.   This required close interaction with all&#13;
&#13;
 involved sectors, and the new conceptual framework on&#13;
&#13;
 social risk management features prominently in the WDR in&#13;
&#13;
 the "Security" chapter, which together with opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 and voice and empowerment constitutes the core element of&#13;
&#13;
 the report.&#13;
&#13;
           Thirdly, the concept and strategic thrust of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy paper was developed in interaction with the&#13;
&#13;
 regions, which concurrently drafted their own regional&#13;
&#13;
 papers, which resulted in feedback into the overall Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Paper.&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&#13;
           Fourth, the suggested conceptual framework of&#13;
&#13;
 the paper, social risk management, has already been tested&#13;
&#13;
 and successfully applied in various regions.       In LAC, six&#13;
&#13;
 country strategy papers have been finished this fiscal&#13;
&#13;
 year, amongst them Argentina, Mexico and Jamaica--and you&#13;
&#13;
 may wish afterward to ask Ana-Marie Arriagada to give her&#13;
&#13;
 views on that--and five more are envisaged for FY01.&#13;
&#13;
 Also, in the African regions, in various countries, the&#13;
&#13;
 approach has been successfully applied, including Togo and&#13;
&#13;
 Benin.&#13;
&#13;
           Fifth, based on the outline endorsed by this&#13;
&#13;
 Committee 11 months ago, we consulted widely with&#13;
&#13;
 international partners, including the Commission for&#13;
&#13;
 Social Development of the UN, UNICEF, ILO, UNDP, DFID,&#13;
&#13;
 GDZ, French Authority, USAT, and other bilaterals.&#13;
&#13;
           And last but not least, the paper has benefitted&#13;
&#13;
 from an external advisory panel consisting of&#13;
&#13;
 policymakers, academics, and NGOs from different regions.&#13;
&#13;
           On the strategic conclusion, my last point, the&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Strategy Paper comes out with a number of strategic&#13;
&#13;
 conclusions.   First, it sees social protection as a theme,&#13;
&#13;
 as gender as well as a sector.      As a theme, it requires&#13;
&#13;
 close interaction with other sectors of the Bank beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         13&#13;
&#13;
 other social sectors such as infrastructure and&#13;
&#13;
 agricultural development.     As a sector, it requires a&#13;
&#13;
 rethinking and reorientation of some of its work, and&#13;
&#13;
 examples include in the pension area, for example, to give&#13;
&#13;
 more emphasis to noncontributory income support to the&#13;
&#13;
 elderly; in the labor market, to look at unemployment&#13;
&#13;
 benefits beyond unemployment insurance; in the social&#13;
&#13;
 safety net area, to investigate strategies which provide&#13;
&#13;
 with coping assistance while helping with risk mitigation&#13;
&#13;
 and reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, social protection and social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management will reach out into new and promising areas&#13;
&#13;
 with limited Bank and global knowledge--for example,&#13;
&#13;
 strengthening the informal risk management arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 through the improvement of legal provisions--this seems to&#13;
&#13;
 be of particular importance for women and children--and&#13;
&#13;
 improving the linkages between the informal and market-&#13;
&#13;
 based arrangements where promising areas include linking&#13;
&#13;
 up community insurance and market-based insurance and&#13;
&#13;
 development marketplace provided grants for this, which is&#13;
&#13;
 undertaken together with the ILO.&#13;
&#13;
           Third, in order to use the scarce budgeted&#13;
&#13;
 resources of our client countries, social protection and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                14&#13;
&#13;
 social risk management endorses understanding of the main&#13;
&#13;
 risks the poor are confronted with.        As a simplified&#13;
&#13;
 example, if AIDS is the main risk in a country, leaving&#13;
&#13;
 many children and elderly without income support, this&#13;
&#13;
 requires a different approach than if the main risk is&#13;
&#13;
 flooding or drought.&#13;
&#13;
           And last but not least, this approach requires a&#13;
&#13;
 rethinking and a reassessment of our external and internal&#13;
&#13;
 partnerships for which the paper outlines a process with&#13;
&#13;
 well-defined criteria.&#13;
&#13;
           Ladies and gentlemen of CODE, with this Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Paper, we have attempted to move social&#13;
&#13;
 protection to the core of the development debate as well&#13;
&#13;
 as in the center of our poverty mission.           Wit this draft&#13;
&#13;
 of the paper, we don't consider that the work has been&#13;
&#13;
 done; we consider this a beginning.        There is much more&#13;
&#13;
 work to be done in the years to come.         But we are&#13;
&#13;
 confident that the new strategic doors have been opened,&#13;
&#13;
 and we look forward to the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Did Steen want to come in at this point?          Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           15&#13;
&#13;
            I might just underscore your point about this&#13;
&#13;
 being cross-cutting and in that sense not a sector.      The&#13;
&#13;
 same point arose when we were talking about the&#13;
&#13;
 preliminary work on the gender strategy, and I flag this&#13;
&#13;
 because I think it is something that we are wrestling&#13;
&#13;
 with.    Conceptually, it may be quite important, because if&#13;
&#13;
 we regard it as a sector, certain relationships&#13;
&#13;
 potentially flow from that, and what you are underscoring&#13;
&#13;
 both in the report and in the opening is that it has been&#13;
&#13;
 essential to this work to conceive of this in a very, very&#13;
&#13;
 cross-cutting way; so perhaps--and this may emerge more in&#13;
&#13;
 our discussion--we need to consciously not use, not term&#13;
&#13;
 this a "sector," but find another nomenclature that keeps&#13;
&#13;
 it distinct, because I see this as something that we&#13;
&#13;
 really are struggling with in these areas that inherently&#13;
&#13;
 reach across, and our success really will pivot on the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity to do so.    So I think that will probably be&#13;
&#13;
 further developed in discussion.&#13;
&#13;
            Bob Picciotto, did you want to come in at this&#13;
&#13;
 point?&#13;
&#13;
            MR. PICCIOTTO:    No.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                   16&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:    Very good.      Then, I will move&#13;
&#13;
 directly to my speakers list, and I have Koen Davidse as&#13;
&#13;
 the first speaker.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DAVIDSE:    Thanks, Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           With reference to the point you just made, I&#13;
&#13;
 think we earlier on discussed whether there is a need for&#13;
&#13;
 a TSP in addition to an SSP, in the sense that you simply&#13;
&#13;
 term some Thematic Strategy Papers and others Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Papers.   But I think in the end, we all&#13;
&#13;
 understand what we mean.&#13;
&#13;
           We have already shared some comments with staff,&#13;
&#13;
 and some comments relate to the points in the guidance&#13;
&#13;
 note you sent around, although I will be a bit more&#13;
&#13;
 socially protective of the authors on some points.            I will&#13;
&#13;
 refer to some of the points you made but go through--well,&#13;
&#13;
 I'll just go through them and say what I am focusing on.&#13;
&#13;
           First, on the definition question, we are very&#13;
&#13;
 pleased actually that already in the title, "Spring&#13;
&#13;
 Board," the document avoids the risk of isolating social&#13;
&#13;
 protection and seeing it as a solution.             It is not, since&#13;
&#13;
 a social protection focus basically indicates that growth&#13;
&#13;
 in itself is not enough, because it needs to be inclusive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            17&#13;
&#13;
           The concept of social risk management and the&#13;
&#13;
 combined focus on prevention, mitigation and coping in our&#13;
&#13;
 view has established a link to active, holistic poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction and has inspired the discussions on CDF, the&#13;
&#13;
 WDR, and PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
           Having said that--and that is the second point&#13;
&#13;
 on the cross-connections--we do agree with the people in&#13;
&#13;
 the CODE Subcommittee who said that sometimes the cross-&#13;
&#13;
 connections are not highlighted sufficiently.       I would&#13;
&#13;
 especially like to refer to gender, which the German&#13;
&#13;
 comments included.    We think this is the major lost&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity of the strategy.       There seems ample need and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity to beef up the attention to gender in this&#13;
&#13;
 document and in the programs that follow.&#13;
&#13;
           Another issue where the cross-connections are&#13;
&#13;
 actually well-made but should be clarified is on core&#13;
&#13;
 labor standards.   The core labor standards should be more&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly acknowledged, and more explicit assessment&#13;
&#13;
 should be made of what we do with them.&#13;
&#13;
           There is also an overall point which was made in&#13;
&#13;
 the guidance note which is more a generic SSP issue,&#13;
&#13;
 whether this is an advocacy document that tells us more&#13;
&#13;
 funds are needed, like in paragraphs 160 and 177, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                   18&#13;
&#13;
 whether this is an integrated view by Management of what&#13;
&#13;
 is important.    We feel that this document should basically&#13;
&#13;
 say that Management intends to do this at these costs.&#13;
&#13;
           We do feel that the document is very candid on&#13;
&#13;
 organizational issues and very clear, but we think these&#13;
&#13;
 tensions should be resolved before we get to see this&#13;
&#13;
 document at CODE.&#13;
&#13;
           On the issue of partnerships, we agree with&#13;
&#13;
 others that we like the focus on it, but we hope that more&#13;
&#13;
 can be added in terms of selectivity on the basis of what&#13;
&#13;
 other partners are doing, and maybe that should be done on&#13;
&#13;
 a country-by-country basis, but some indications can be&#13;
&#13;
 given on this.&#13;
&#13;
           On the PRSP, we welcome the strong link that is&#13;
&#13;
 made with the PRSP process in paragraph 85 and onward, but&#13;
&#13;
 what we already shared with staff is that we also fully&#13;
&#13;
 agree that the PRSP can be seen as, and I quote, "a way of&#13;
&#13;
 making the CDF operational that systematically links&#13;
&#13;
 diagnosis and public actions to outcomes."           The PRSP,&#13;
&#13;
 after all, is supposed to be the country strategy.          But&#13;
&#13;
 the document should reflect that it was the international&#13;
&#13;
 community represented in the IMF Committee and the&#13;
&#13;
 Development Committee that endorsed the PRSP effort.             The&#13;
&#13;

                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                          19&#13;
&#13;
 phrase "both organizations decided" is too limited and&#13;
&#13;
 should be revised because it creates the impression that&#13;
&#13;
 we have a document which is only owned by the Bretton&#13;
&#13;
 Woods institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           On the issue of selectivity which you raised in&#13;
&#13;
 your note, the fact that the strategy for social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management will be country-driven is in line with the&#13;
&#13;
 ownership idea of the PRSP, but we do hope that it will be&#13;
&#13;
 part of country dialogue where relevant, especially in the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP process.   In that sense, the Bank should own this a&#13;
&#13;
 little as well.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, we agree with others that paragraph 16&#13;
&#13;
 seems very optimistic about social funds while an OED&#13;
&#13;
 review is underway.     We feel that this review should be&#13;
&#13;
 reflected.   Perhaps OED can say something about where this&#13;
&#13;
 review is going.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           In the interest of efficiency, let me just say&#13;
&#13;
 that this chair strongly agrees with your points on gender&#13;
&#13;
 and core labor standards, indeed all of your points, and&#13;
&#13;
 particularly the importance of the country dialogue in&#13;
&#13;
 those cases where a country may not be at a stage where it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              20&#13;
&#13;
 places priority on a matter like gender, where our&#13;
&#13;
 international experience strongly indicates the&#13;
&#13;
 correlation with development effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
           Next I have Anna Brandt.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. BRANDT:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           We really welcome this discussion.        We were all&#13;
&#13;
 geared up to go a month ago, so we have been impatiently&#13;
&#13;
 waiting for this opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
           The social protection area or social protection&#13;
&#13;
 as a theme--because I do agree it is not a sector--is&#13;
&#13;
 something which my authorities attach great importance to,&#13;
&#13;
 and we would like to comment staff for a very&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive document.    We know that a lot of work and&#13;
&#13;
 dedication has gone into this effort.         I think we should&#13;
&#13;
 recognize that social protection and the social protection&#13;
&#13;
 area is a relatively new field of Bank involvement, and&#13;
&#13;
 producing a strategy for these activities is particularly&#13;
&#13;
 challenging against that background.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to firstly relate to some of the&#13;
&#13;
 questions that Jan put out in her email; I think that was&#13;
&#13;
 very helpful to try to focus us.       So I would like to first&#13;
&#13;
 say something about ownership and audience; secondly, on&#13;
&#13;
 the definition and linkages to social development; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             21&#13;
&#13;
 thirdly, on stock-taking, performance, and strategic&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity.   Then, after that, I have a few other&#13;
&#13;
 specific comments that were not raised in Jan's email that&#13;
&#13;
 I would like to mention also.&#13;
&#13;
           I was very grateful for Mr. Doryan's&#13;
&#13;
 introduction and emphasis that this is the Bank's Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Paper on social protection.        I think that is&#13;
&#13;
 something that we would whole-heartedly support.        I must&#13;
&#13;
 say, though, that in reading the document, you might be&#13;
&#13;
 fooled and interpret this more as a social protection&#13;
&#13;
 sector board strategy.    I think that in revising this&#13;
&#13;
 document after our discussion, it is very important that&#13;
&#13;
 we clean it up from this misunderstanding.&#13;
&#13;
           Just to mention a few paragraphs, paragraphs 2,&#13;
&#13;
 6, 7, 89, 91, 94, 99, 108, 124 are examples of where we&#13;
&#13;
 are talking about the social protection sector board will&#13;
&#13;
 do this, that, and the other, and I think it is important&#13;
&#13;
 that that is not the message that is given by the paper,&#13;
&#13;
 but rather that this is what the Bank is going to do in&#13;
&#13;
 the field of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
           I am also happy that a lot of representatives&#13;
&#13;
 from the various regions are here today, because&#13;
&#13;
 obviously, their buy-in into this strategy is extremely&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                 22&#13;
&#13;
 important; but I think also that some of the other&#13;
&#13;
 networks, especially ESSD and PREM, are also important&#13;
&#13;
 stakeholders in this strategy, since a lot of the social&#13;
&#13;
 protection activities relate very strongly to work that is&#13;
&#13;
 ongoing in those two Networks.         So I would have liked to&#13;
&#13;
 see a representative also from these two Networks.         Maybe&#13;
&#13;
 there is someone here--yes, okay--although it wasn't&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned.   Good.&#13;
&#13;
           When it comes to audience, which I think is&#13;
&#13;
 linked to this, I would like to say, as we have said on a&#13;
&#13;
 number of occasions when it comes to these SSPs, that&#13;
&#13;
 while we recognize the importance of the whole internal&#13;
&#13;
 consensus-building around an SSP, we also feel that it is&#13;
&#13;
 very important to focus on the external audience.         The&#13;
&#13;
 same way that the CASs have an external audience, we feel&#13;
&#13;
 also the SSPs have a potentially important external&#13;
&#13;
 audience, and we very much see these two instruments as&#13;
&#13;
 sort of mirror images.&#13;
&#13;
           And just to note that the Bank's full SSP on&#13;
&#13;
 Health, Nutrition, and Population managed very well, I&#13;
&#13;
 think, to balance these two roles of the internal and&#13;
&#13;
 external audiences, so I think that this is what we would&#13;
&#13;
 like to see also in the strategy.          I think cleaning up the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                   23&#13;
&#13;
 language in terms of what the social protection sector is&#13;
&#13;
 doing and not doing helps us make this more appealing to&#13;
&#13;
 an external audience.&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, the definition of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
 I think this is a fairly difficult issue.           We certainly&#13;
&#13;
 very much welcome the broadening of the definition of&#13;
&#13;
 social protection beyond the sort of traditional way of&#13;
&#13;
 looking at social protection.      We think that the risk&#13;
&#13;
 management framework is a very interesting one, a very&#13;
&#13;
 appealing one, but we do at the same time feel that it&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be put into a broader context.            By this, we mean-&#13;
&#13;
 -I think Koen touched upon this recently--linking more&#13;
&#13;
 clearly to the Program of Action adopted at the Copenhagen&#13;
&#13;
 Social Summit in 1995 would be one way of putting it more&#13;
&#13;
 into context.&#13;
&#13;
           There is a box on page 8, Box 2.2, that refers&#13;
&#13;
 to some of the commitments made in Copenhagen, but we&#13;
&#13;
 would suggest a complete description of what was agreed.&#13;
&#13;
 This agreed Program of Action forms the framework in which&#13;
&#13;
 we should put social protection in our minds.&#13;
&#13;
           We would also like to see an analysis of how the&#13;
&#13;
 Copenhagen principles have guided the Bank's work in&#13;
&#13;
 social protection over the last five years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                24&#13;
&#13;
             In Chapter 9, the follow-up to the Copenhagen&#13;
&#13;
 Summit is mentioned, and in this context, it would have&#13;
&#13;
 been interesting to get more elaboration on how the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 work in social protection will feed into this process.&#13;
&#13;
             Linked to this is also a reference to the&#13;
&#13;
 principles and good practice in social policy endorsed by&#13;
&#13;
 the Development Committee one year ago, and also, linkages&#13;
&#13;
 to these principles I think would have been beneficial for&#13;
&#13;
 our understanding of how social protection fits into the&#13;
&#13;
 broader context.&#13;
&#13;
             And quite frankly, we feel that social&#13;
&#13;
 protection is a necessary foundation for sustainable&#13;
&#13;
 development, and we would have liked this to be emphasized&#13;
&#13;
 in the definition.    So, while agreeing that a definition&#13;
&#13;
 based on social risk management is an appropriate one,&#13;
&#13;
 stressing the importance of social protection in a wider&#13;
&#13;
 framework I think is something that we would also like to&#13;
&#13;
 see here.&#13;
&#13;
             The WDR on poverty was mentioned by Robert&#13;
&#13;
 Holzmann, and there are clear linkages in the paper to&#13;
&#13;
 one aspect of the three-pronged approach to the WDR--the&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability and security issues.         That we think is good,&#13;
&#13;
 but we also feel that social protection is an important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              25&#13;
&#13;
 prerequisite for supporting the other two pillars in this&#13;
&#13;
 analysis, namely, the empowerment and the increased&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities for the poor.     So that is something that I&#13;
&#13;
 think could be expanded--it is not just security and&#13;
&#13;
 probability; it is the other aspects also of the widening&#13;
&#13;
 interpretation of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           When it comes to PRSPs, we feel that the&#13;
&#13;
 integration of social protection is a very important&#13;
&#13;
 measure to fight poverty.     As the paper says, this will be&#13;
&#13;
 very important going forward.      It is not just for HIPCs, I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to suggest--there was some confusing language--&#13;
&#13;
 it is for all low-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
           And we would actually argue for a more proactive&#13;
&#13;
 approach by the Bank in terms of stressing the importance&#13;
&#13;
 of social protection.    We would argue for inclusion of&#13;
&#13;
 social protection components in adjustment lending more&#13;
&#13;
 across the board than what is present at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
           We feel that the language in some instances is&#13;
&#13;
 not clear enough in proactivity.       I think on page 7 of the&#13;
&#13;
 summary and page 60 of the main text, there is language&#13;
&#13;
 along the lines of we would respond to governments'&#13;
&#13;
 demands or, even worse, I think, we would respond to&#13;
&#13;
 Country Directors' interests.      I think that obviously, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&#13;
 are a demand-driven institution and can't do anything that&#13;
&#13;
 the governments don't want, but I think a more proactive&#13;
&#13;
 approach here and not sort of leaving this important issue&#13;
&#13;
 in the hands of a Country Director's interest I think&#13;
&#13;
 would be appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
           Thirdly, the stock-taking and lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
 This is not specific to this SSP.       I think nearly all SSPs&#13;
&#13;
 that we have are a bit weak in this respect.        And I think&#13;
&#13;
 more elaboration about--even though we may just have a 10-&#13;
&#13;
 year experience in this field--I think more elaboration on&#13;
&#13;
 what our lessons are from past experience in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 guiding us for the future would have been appreciated--&#13;
&#13;
 what has worked well and what has worked less well in the&#13;
&#13;
 area of social protection so far.&#13;
&#13;
           Linked to this is an analysis of what other&#13;
&#13;
 partners are doing in this area.       There is a very useful&#13;
&#13;
 box on page 56, Box 7.1.    There, it is laid out how the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank will cooperate with its partners.         But I think it&#13;
&#13;
 would also have been nice to see what areas of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection should the Bank engage in based on, then,&#13;
&#13;
 first, the evaluation of the existing programs, secondly,&#13;
&#13;
 what other partners are doing, and thirdly, what our&#13;
&#13;
 comparative advantage is.     I think this is what should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  27&#13;
&#13;
 guide us in terms of strategic selectivity for the future,&#13;
&#13;
 and that is not sort of crystal-clear that we have these&#13;
&#13;
 building blocks and pointing directions for future&#13;
&#13;
 activities.&#13;
&#13;
           Related to this is a box on page 54, mentioning&#13;
&#13;
 UNDP's Global Program on Sustainable Development.           I think&#13;
&#13;
 that here, some more elaboration on the division of labor&#13;
&#13;
 between the Bank's strategy and in particular UNDP's work&#13;
&#13;
 in this area would have been interesting.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to commend the authors for Chapter&#13;
&#13;
 8, which gives suggested priorities and suggested&#13;
&#13;
 directions.   I think this is an attempt to a business plan&#13;
&#13;
 which is a lot better than we have seen in other SSPs we&#13;
&#13;
 have been discussing and is something that the Board has&#13;
&#13;
 often asked for.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is very good, and in particular Table&#13;
&#13;
 8.5 on page 67, which gives suggested monitorable&#13;
&#13;
 indicators, I think is very commendable.            But I do have&#13;
&#13;
 one comment on this.    I would have thought that the&#13;
&#13;
 natural conclusion of the analysis building up to this&#13;
&#13;
 Chapter 8 would have been that the Bank should increase&#13;
&#13;
 its focus on Africa.    Given the shortcomings of existing&#13;
&#13;
 social protection mechanisms and the poverty situation on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               28&#13;
&#13;
 this continent, we feel very strongly that the Bank needs&#13;
&#13;
 to increase its activities in this area in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
            In Box 2.3 on page 10, there is a reference to&#13;
&#13;
 the inability of African central governments to deliver&#13;
&#13;
 social protection services.     We firmly believe that it is&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's responsibility to help them improve in this&#13;
&#13;
 respect.&#13;
&#13;
            The question of public versus market-based&#13;
&#13;
 interventions is discussed in the SSP.         We would actually&#13;
&#13;
 like to see clearer language on the need to promote a&#13;
&#13;
 certain level of minimum provision of public services for&#13;
&#13;
 social protection.   We feel that in the Bank's policy&#13;
&#13;
 dialogue with clients, we need to emphasize this as a&#13;
&#13;
 government responsibility, both in terms of setting the&#13;
&#13;
 policy framework, for instance, on labor standards, but&#13;
&#13;
 also in terms of actual delivery of social protection, it&#13;
&#13;
 should be spelled out as a government responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
            Linked to this is, of course, addressing&#13;
&#13;
 capacity constraints, the efficiency of service delivery,&#13;
&#13;
 the absence of corruption and sound public management.&#13;
&#13;
 These issues are clearly identified by the poor themselves&#13;
&#13;
 in the "Voices of the Poor" study.        And when it comes to&#13;
&#13;
 private or market-based interventions, we would expect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            29&#13;
&#13;
 close cooperation with IFC and MIGA.        I think there was&#13;
&#13;
 very little on how the Bank links in with these other two&#13;
&#13;
 arms of the Bank Group in the private sector field.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, I would agree very much with my Dutch&#13;
&#13;
 colleague on gender.   I think on page 51 and 52, there is&#13;
&#13;
 reference to the right to own assets and the restrictions&#13;
&#13;
 that often exist for women on building up or inheriting&#13;
&#13;
 assets.   We fully support the Bank focusing greater&#13;
&#13;
 attention on these discriminating features of many legal&#13;
&#13;
 systems, but we also feel at the same time that the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy would have benefitted from similar gender-&#13;
&#13;
 disaggregated analyses and proposals for Bank actions in&#13;
&#13;
 other areas of social protection as well.&#13;
&#13;
           On labor markets, I have two specific comments.&#13;
&#13;
 We would encourage the Bank to do more analytical work on&#13;
&#13;
 the linkages between the freedom of association and the&#13;
&#13;
 right to collective bargaining on the one hand and&#13;
&#13;
 economic development and poverty reduction on the other.&#13;
&#13;
 There is a reference made on this in paragraph 115.&#13;
&#13;
           And second, referring to paragraph 120 on child&#13;
&#13;
 labor, we would suggest stronger language to the tune of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank actively working to eliminate the worst forms of&#13;
&#13;
 child labor.   We would also like to include actions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 situations.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I can quickly see that I can eliminate an&#13;
&#13;
 intervention from this chair, because all the points are&#13;
&#13;
 being covered, and I would just underscore in that regard&#13;
&#13;
 as the U.S. Chair your point on child labor and very much&#13;
&#13;
 so, I think a very important point on the other two&#13;
&#13;
 pillars brought out in the WDR, increased opportunity and&#13;
&#13;
 employment as well as the vulnerability.           I think that is&#13;
&#13;
 quite a viable linkage, and we should not restrict&#13;
&#13;
 ourselves too narrowly, because I think it does apply to&#13;
&#13;
 the other two as well. So thank you for that very broad&#13;
&#13;
 intervention.&#13;
&#13;
           Next, I have Matthias Meyer.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:    Thank you, Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't want to emphasize too much this general&#13;
&#13;
 problem of definition, except to give it kind of a&#13;
&#13;
 positive touch in the sense that I think it is obviously&#13;
&#13;
 both.   And actually, I guess we don't know yet exactly how&#13;
&#13;
 much beyond the core areas the Social Security Board and&#13;
&#13;
 the specialists working in these areas should have a main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             31&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility and how much they can have an influence on&#13;
&#13;
 other parts of the Bank, and these would be quite a few,&#13;
&#13;
 actually, in terms of finding new methods.         In other&#13;
&#13;
 words, I see somehow some core areas where this sector has&#13;
&#13;
 to become active and more active, and then a participation&#13;
&#13;
 through new methods and new analytical tools in other&#13;
&#13;
 areas of the Bank.    And that, of course, is always a big&#13;
&#13;
 question--how to do that and how to do it efficiently and&#13;
&#13;
 avoid duplications.&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, I would say at the outset that&#13;
&#13;
 what is really key is implementation, and I would just&#13;
&#13;
 like to refer to two examples of other strategies where I&#13;
&#13;
 feel that implementation is a big problem.&#13;
&#13;
           For instance, I am referring to "Fuel for&#13;
&#13;
 Thought," which had specific targets, had an&#13;
&#13;
 implementation plan, and when we look now at what has been&#13;
&#13;
 implemented over six months, we can see that the easy&#13;
&#13;
 parts have been implemented, and on the real critical&#13;
&#13;
 things, there has not been any advance at all.        And when&#13;
&#13;
 you talk about the people about this, they will tell you:&#13;
&#13;
 Look, we have a very small secretariat, we are not very&#13;
&#13;
 many people, and we have absolutely no real influence on&#13;
&#13;
 operations in the Bank.    So how to achieve that influence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 so that it really changes something and you can achieve&#13;
&#13;
 your targets--I think that is the critical question of any&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Strategy, and I guess the requirement to make the&#13;
&#13;
 claim on resources credible is to be able to show the ways&#13;
&#13;
 and the methods the Bank is going to adopt that approach&#13;
&#13;
 very specifically through indicators, through specific&#13;
&#13;
 personnel measures, through internal decisionmaking&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
           You have gone a long way in this to try to go in&#13;
&#13;
 that direction, but I think there is still, unfortunately,&#13;
&#13;
 a long way to go, because you have at least 20 or 25 other&#13;
&#13;
 groups making similar claims on the resources of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 and with several means.    So I think we have to become much&#13;
&#13;
 more demanding on how the Bank is going to translate any&#13;
&#13;
 new strategy into action.&#13;
&#13;
           The second example I would like to give--I&#13;
&#13;
 wasn't here this morning on the report of OED on "Vision&#13;
&#13;
 for Action," but I think it was a very similar problem.&#13;
&#13;
 In that case, even I guess the knowledge among Bank staff&#13;
&#13;
 as the first indicator is not so great, and secondly, the&#13;
&#13;
 perception in the country was even less clear on what&#13;
&#13;
 exactly the Bank wanted to achieve through this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 So the same thing is going to happen to you--in two or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           33&#13;
&#13;
 three years' time, there is going to be a team of&#13;
&#13;
 independent consultants going out to ask people in the&#13;
&#13;
 country, Now, what about the social security strategy of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank, and how many people know about it, how&#13;
&#13;
 completely will that have been translated into concrete&#13;
&#13;
 activities, and are you sure that with the present&#13;
&#13;
 strategy, in three years' time, there is going to be&#13;
&#13;
 important concrete ideas and actions left which are&#13;
&#13;
 testimony to this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           So here, of course, the question of budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 resources comes in, and there was a whole debate over&#13;
&#13;
 whether with each strategy there should be a budget or&#13;
&#13;
 not.   I don't necessarily think that is the moment to come&#13;
&#13;
 with a specific budget, but clearly such a strategy should&#13;
&#13;
 be reflected as a program in the budget, I think, or the&#13;
&#13;
 business plan and targets should be attached to it, and in&#13;
&#13;
 that sense, what you indicate as targets and indicators I&#13;
&#13;
 think is a very honorable and extraordinarily good effort,&#13;
&#13;
 but I guess the big question is should those preliminary&#13;
&#13;
 targets become binding targets, should the Bank adopt them&#13;
&#13;
 or not, or are they so preliminary that you really want to&#13;
&#13;
 experiment with them to find the right targets.    And then,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           34&#13;
&#13;
 once you really can define the targets in a credible way,&#13;
&#13;
 in a binding way, of course, it becomes a strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           I am not sure whether we are really at the first&#13;
&#13;
 stage, where we just try to experiment with targets or&#13;
&#13;
 whether we are really ready to define targets even if,&#13;
&#13;
 after a while, they will have to be changed.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, when one looks at the regional analysis&#13;
&#13;
 which you are making, it is actually quite thin.   I mean,&#13;
&#13;
 it is not quite clear what the regions really want to do&#13;
&#13;
 with this strategy.   It is much less thin and much more&#13;
&#13;
 convincing when one looks at the very important number of&#13;
&#13;
 countries where you are actually already involved.    There,&#13;
&#13;
 you have different categories of involvement, and it&#13;
&#13;
 actually would be interesting to know whether these&#13;
&#13;
 different categories really make a big difference and how&#13;
&#13;
 important that involvement is and how that is important&#13;
&#13;
 for the future.   Of course, that would also answer the&#13;
&#13;
 question of whether strategies should be very different&#13;
&#13;
 according to continents and countries, whether there is&#13;
&#13;
 really a need for this kind of analysis more in some&#13;
&#13;
 regions than in others, and another important question&#13;
&#13;
 which you have answered, actually, not very well, I think,&#13;
&#13;
 which is there seems to be in this document--and maybe I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         35&#13;
&#13;
 am wrong, because I haven't read it all--a certain bias&#13;
&#13;
 against informal ways of coping with risks.&#13;
&#13;
           There is the basic alternative that the state&#13;
&#13;
 intervenes or the market comes in, but then we have this&#13;
&#13;
 nice report going to Geneva 2000, which has a whole&#13;
&#13;
 chapter on social capital and how important additional&#13;
&#13;
 ways of building on social capital are to deal with&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability and deal with risk, because social capital&#13;
&#13;
 is particularly important to deal with vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
           So I would imagine that particularly in the case&#13;
&#13;
 of Africa, but in other areas, the way to use traditional&#13;
&#13;
 ways of coping with risks could become a very important&#13;
&#13;
 point of departure for designing strategies and not be&#13;
&#13;
 considered kind of a leftover of an old society which is&#13;
&#13;
 going to disappear anyhow.     But maybe I am wrong; maybe&#13;
&#13;
 these are things which we should forget because societies&#13;
&#13;
 are changing so quickly that we cannot rely on that kind&#13;
&#13;
 of social capital.   But at least an explanation I think&#13;
&#13;
 would be very important.&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, I share very much Anna's judgment&#13;
&#13;
 that you cannot be so demanding on the one side, with&#13;
&#13;
 basically new methods on the other side so pragmatic in&#13;
&#13;
 saying well, of course, what we are going to do is going&#13;

&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              36&#13;
&#13;
 to depend on resources, and it is going to depend on what&#13;
&#13;
 the Country Directors think and whether they think it is&#13;
&#13;
 important and what countries think.         I think that if the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank is convinced this is a basic method which has to be&#13;
&#13;
 applied and which is of high priority, then I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have to clearly in the strategy be more proactive and set&#13;
&#13;
 more precise goals and put the means behind it.&#13;
&#13;
           Of course, to the extent that you extend to a&#13;
&#13;
 lot of areas and to new analytical tools, the question of&#13;
&#13;
 duplication is very strong, and I think there has to be&#13;
&#13;
 some effort in defining maybe a little bit better how you&#13;
&#13;
 would intervene.   For instance, in terms of social funds,&#13;
&#13;
 social funds so far, I guess, have not been a main concern&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of social security.       You imply that there has to&#13;
&#13;
 be kind of a category of investments added to the social&#13;
&#13;
 fund concept--what are these, and how would this change&#13;
&#13;
 the nature of social funds as they exist now, and who&#13;
&#13;
 would take responsibility for it inside the Bank.        The&#13;
&#13;
 same, of course, in terms of micro enterprise, financial&#13;
&#13;
 sector activities, insurance activities, the question of&#13;
&#13;
 the disaster management facility.&#13;
&#13;
           Actually, the other day, I talked to people in&#13;
&#13;
 the environmental sector, and one of their preoccupations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         37&#13;
&#13;
 is the global environmental problems where, of course, it&#13;
&#13;
 is not only important to deal with countries in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 how they should reduce emissions, but also how they should&#13;
&#13;
 cope with the impact of disasters coming out of global&#13;
&#13;
 environmental problems. So in that sense, of course, they&#13;
&#13;
 deal with very similar issues, namely, how to do capacity-&#13;
&#13;
 building to prevent risks.&#13;
&#13;
           So I guess there is a whole internal Bank kind&#13;
&#13;
 of rearrangement of roles which in some way I think should&#13;
&#13;
 be defined a little more than what you are able to do at&#13;
&#13;
 this stage in this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           There is also a question of coherence in that&#13;
&#13;
 sense, but I know I am going to a little far here--I don't&#13;
&#13;
 want to insist too much--but we insist very much on these&#13;
&#13;
 core labor standards here and on how important it is to&#13;
&#13;
 stabilize in this field the situation of poor people.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, it might be that this has not much to do with what&#13;
&#13;
 was talked about this morning about flexibility in&#13;
&#13;
 Argentina and the labor market and reaching much higher&#13;
&#13;
 flexibility, but somewhere there is a point where we have&#13;
&#13;
 two faces.   We are insisting in terms of much better&#13;
&#13;
 market mechanisms on more flexibility, which practically&#13;
&#13;
 means less labor protection, and then we insist in other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  38&#13;
&#13;
 parts of the Bank    on creating higher protection.          I know&#13;
&#13;
 this is a question of informal and formal sectors, and&#13;
&#13;
 maybe we have totally tight areas, but somehow, there&#13;
&#13;
 could be a confusing message being given to the outside&#13;
&#13;
 world.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, on partnerships, again, I think you&#13;
&#13;
 have gone a far way here--you have gone much further than&#13;
&#13;
 many other people in the Bank in trying to point out what&#13;
&#13;
 the complementarities are, but even there, as Anna said&#13;
&#13;
 before, there is still some way to go.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:     I have a thought in listening to&#13;
&#13;
 your presentation and Anna's before you.             We may not get&#13;
&#13;
 to the rich variety of regional experience which is&#13;
&#13;
 arrayed here in the room in this discussion.            It may be&#13;
&#13;
 that it is provided for in other fora, and possibly when&#13;
&#13;
 the team comes back, they can comment on this; but if not,&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps we should arrange just an informal workshop which&#13;
&#13;
 would be an opportunity for those interested to hear some&#13;
&#13;
 of the experience regionally--you alluded to what Latin&#13;
&#13;
 America has done and the experience of Africa--so that the&#13;
&#13;
 Board could better understand at the level of application&#13;
&#13;
 in the region.   Maybe others who have yet to intervene&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            39&#13;
&#13;
 could comment on whether they think that would be useful,&#13;
&#13;
 because we have had such a stress in the interventions on&#13;
&#13;
 the importance of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
             The other comment I would make at this stage is&#13;
&#13;
 that I think, Matthias, some of the challenge that you&#13;
&#13;
 very appropriately frame almost goes to Senior Management&#13;
&#13;
 and us on the Board, because it goes to the reconciliation&#13;
&#13;
 of a number of strategies, thematic and sector strategies,&#13;
&#13;
 and how we allocate the resources.         Some of those&#13;
&#13;
 resources are embedded in the regional budgets, some       in&#13;
&#13;
 the network budgets, and I'm not clear whether, as we&#13;
&#13;
 approach the budget discussion which is impending, we as a&#13;
&#13;
 Board can even track the allocation--we can't track the&#13;
&#13;
 allocation now by theme--so I think your observation is&#13;
&#13;
 accurate.    We don't necessarily have clarity at the next&#13;
&#13;
 level across all of these strategies and regions as to how&#13;
&#13;
 we have aligned the corporate priorities despite the forum&#13;
&#13;
 that opens the year now.     So that may be yet--we can't&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily hold this team totally accountable to answer&#13;
&#13;
 those questions, but they are very important questions.&#13;
&#13;
             Next, I have Paulo Gomes.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. GOMES:   Thank you, Madam Chairperson.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                          40&#13;
&#13;
            Well, I feel the pain of Matthias on the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.   I think now in the Bank, people say&#13;
&#13;
 "Assume implementation."     That is why sometimes I am&#13;
&#13;
 personally very skeptical about the good initiatives here&#13;
&#13;
 in the Bank, because we have this budget problem.      This&#13;
&#13;
 chair has raised this issue several times, and we will do&#13;
&#13;
 it again during the budget discussion.&#13;
&#13;
            I think this is a very good piece of work, very&#13;
&#13;
 informative and useful, but I think people don't&#13;
&#13;
 understand that if you want to address this kind of issue,&#13;
&#13;
 you have to look at it in the specific context of the&#13;
&#13;
 continent or the country that you want to implement it in.&#13;
&#13;
 And in the case of Africa, for sure, you will be required&#13;
&#13;
 to look beyond the classical approach to public finance,&#13;
&#13;
 to look into the anthropological aspect of things, the way&#13;
&#13;
 the society functions--and it requires resources, and it&#13;
&#13;
 will not be possible to have quick results in this kind of&#13;
&#13;
 thing.   In the Bank now, the way we function is that we&#13;
&#13;
 want quick results, we want quick success stories, and we&#13;
&#13;
 don't provide the resources that people need to do their&#13;
&#13;
 jobs.    But maybe this will be a more pertinent discussion&#13;
&#13;
 during the budget discussion.       And I think that this&#13;
&#13;
 document will help us in the next discussion, because I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               41&#13;
&#13;
 think social protection is a very good tool for conflict&#13;
&#13;
 prevention, mainly in post-conflict, and I think Anna has&#13;
&#13;
 raised this problem.&#13;
&#13;
           Having said that, while I would like to focus on&#13;
&#13;
 social protection in Sub-Saharan Africa, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 thank the staff.   We benefitted extensively from our&#13;
&#13;
 discussion with them previous to this CODE meeting.           In&#13;
&#13;
 Sub-Saharan Africa, rural and informal economies are very&#13;
&#13;
 important.    The formal sector is very small.       Moreover,&#13;
&#13;
 employment in the formal is highly dependent on the state,&#13;
&#13;
 and you know now that the problem is compounded by the&#13;
&#13;
 current reform in the public administration in most&#13;
&#13;
 African countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Most African countries have some form of social&#13;
&#13;
 security arrangements for people who work in the public&#13;
&#13;
 sector or in the private sector.        These arrangements cover&#13;
&#13;
 a small percentage of the population.          An important&#13;
&#13;
 portion of the people, if not most, depend on informal&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms, as Matthias pointed out, internal social&#13;
&#13;
 security and risk management.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that this strategy paper does not say&#13;
&#13;
 much in terms of the Bank's plan of action in the sector&#13;
&#13;
 for Africa.   I think Anna has also underscored this issue.&#13;

 Only a brief summary of the social protection strategy is&#13;
&#13;
 provided in Annex E, page 104.       The core of the paper is&#13;
&#13;
 reflective of a development economy where a large segment&#13;
&#13;
 of the population has regular employment and appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 protection mechanisms.     The situation is completely&#13;
&#13;
 different in poor countries, for instance, in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
 Given the difference, are there plans for an appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 social protection mechanism to cover broad segments in the&#13;
&#13;
 poor countries?&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to come back also to the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 the Country Director.     This is why I am quite skeptical.&#13;
&#13;
 I don't see a Country Director giving adequate priority to&#13;
&#13;
 this kind of issue.    I think one would prefer to address&#13;
&#13;
 others issues.    I would like to know how you think it&#13;
&#13;
 could be mitigated and to have the Country Director really&#13;
&#13;
 involved and committed to helping those countries that&#13;
&#13;
 want to have support to address these kinds of problems.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the social protection strategy should&#13;
&#13;
 take into account this important aspect and find ways and&#13;
&#13;
 means to strengthen not just the formal but the informal&#13;
&#13;
 social risk management.     In that sense, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 know if you had a chance to discuss or work with the task&#13;

           Thank you, Madam Chairman.&#13;

           MS. PIERCY:    Thank you very much.&#13;

           Mr. Holden?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HOLDENN:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me say first of all that I like this&#13;
&#13;
 document, and I must say that in terms of the struggle&#13;
&#13;
 that we are all having with Sector Strategies versus&#13;
&#13;
 Thematic Strategies and so on, I must say that I tended to&#13;
&#13;
 see this one actually as a little more of a Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy with thematic overtones than as a Thematic&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy with sectoral implications.        So I part company&#13;
&#13;
 with some others on that.     But it did, I guess, mean I was&#13;
&#13;
 rather more comfortable than some others with what might&#13;
&#13;
 be seen as a relatively narrow focus.         I was persuaded&#13;
&#13;
 before we came, and I am even more persuaded now that&#13;
&#13;
 seeing this very much in terms of a social protection&#13;
&#13;
 focus rather than a much broader social policy is quite&#13;
&#13;
 legitimate.&#13;
&#13;
           I can agree, notwithstanding that point, with&#13;
&#13;
 most of what others have said, and I'll just very briefly&#13;
&#13;
 touch on a few issues.    On stock-taking, I very much agree&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         44&#13;
&#13;
 with Anna that notwithstanding the relative youth of the&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Board and so on, there is quite a bit of work that&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank has done in the area of pensions and so on.&#13;
&#13;
 Perhaps in our narrow manifestation, it would be useful to&#13;
&#13;
 see more of a stock-taking done on that.&#13;
&#13;
           On selectivity, I agree with several of my&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues.   Relatively, this is a good sector, but there&#13;
&#13;
 is quite some way to go.    And it does go into the whole&#13;
&#13;
 issue of budgeting and so on, which I'll touch on in a&#13;
&#13;
 moment.   We need to both know what others are doing, but&#13;
&#13;
 also a crisper discussion of what we are not going to do&#13;
&#13;
 and what we are going to leave to those others.&#13;
&#13;
           I agree with others, too, that the gender&#13;
&#13;
 dimension here in social protection does need to be&#13;
&#13;
 brought out more clearly.&#13;
&#13;
           On the question which we just touched on before,&#13;
&#13;
 I think, which is this whole question of the extent to&#13;
&#13;
 which these documents are legitimately advocacy pieces,&#13;
&#13;
 whether the Board is the intended audience, or Country&#13;
&#13;
 Directors or Senior Management, I suspect it is a bit of&#13;
&#13;
 an amalgam of all those things, and I must say that I am&#13;
&#13;
 still scratching my head on where I would even like to see&#13;
&#13;
 it, because I do think it is quite useful for us to e&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  45&#13;
&#13;
 exposed to some of the discussion.          I liked Annex F, which&#13;
&#13;
 is saying what we would like to do more of and where we&#13;
&#13;
 would scale back.    I would like Annex F even more if it&#13;
&#13;
 had an Annex F prime, assuming existing resources, what we&#13;
&#13;
 will be doing and what we won't be doing.            And I am not&#13;
&#13;
 sure I am entirely comfortable just seeing the product of&#13;
&#13;
 Senior Management's deliberations as between sectors, so I&#13;
&#13;
 can't actually offer much constructive comment there.           I&#13;
&#13;
 think it is a difficult exercise, and I suspect at the&#13;
&#13;
 end, it is going to be a highly iterative process, but&#13;
&#13;
 like Jan, I certainly feel very ill-prepared to make a&#13;
&#13;
 judgment in a few days in the budget context over this&#13;
&#13;
 area needing more and in this area, needing less.&#13;
&#13;
           One area where perhaps I have misread the&#13;
&#13;
 document somewhat, because it is an area where I am not&#13;
&#13;
 sure I agree with Anna, Matthias or Paulo, and that is&#13;
&#13;
 this question of the--well, I reference my comments to&#13;
&#13;
 Table 4.1, which I actually found a very useful diagnostic&#13;
&#13;
 of looking at market-based approaches, public sector&#13;
&#13;
 approaches, and informal arrangements.           My interpretation&#13;
&#13;
 of that document is rather the opposite, I think, of&#13;
&#13;
 Matthias', and that is that you can't have one-size-fits-&#13;
&#13;
 all, that it depends very much on the situation.           You have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             46&#13;
&#13;
 examples where certainly you could see excessive use of&#13;
&#13;
 formal or public social protection devices, at least&#13;
&#13;
 nominally--and there is an interesting discussion on the&#13;
&#13;
 incidence of many of those--as well as inadequate ones.&#13;
&#13;
 And I for one would add to that dimension that it depends&#13;
&#13;
 on where you start.    I agree with Paulo's comment that it&#13;
&#13;
 also depends in large part on the sociological and&#13;
&#13;
 cultural dimensions there, which steers me, I think, away&#13;
&#13;
 from Anna's position of sort of core minimum, this is&#13;
&#13;
 appropriately a role for the public sector.        I guess I&#13;
&#13;
 would say in that as in many other things that it depends.&#13;
&#13;
           And I suppose related to that, a very tricky&#13;
&#13;
 issue is this whole question of core labor standards,&#13;
&#13;
 which I think is clearly a critical and very difficult&#13;
&#13;
 issue for us, and I suppose if I had to say one thing on&#13;
&#13;
 that, I'd say as well as more discussion bringing in the&#13;
&#13;
 regional dimension for its own sake, it may be worth&#13;
&#13;
 putting aside some time to discuss that particular issue&#13;
&#13;
 as well, because I think it is a very difficult one for us&#13;
&#13;
 to grapple with but one that we must.         And I know there&#13;
&#13;
 are various views on it.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that's all I have to say at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
             Next, I have Mr. Balduino.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BALDUINO:   Thank you very much, Madam Chair.&#13;
&#13;
             I have the impression that the paper and the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion are somewhat hostage to the fact that we have&#13;
&#13;
 not yet totally defined a very important thing--for&#13;
&#13;
 instance, the relationship between the strategies and the&#13;
&#13;
 CASs and what a strategy is supposed to mean exactly and&#13;
&#13;
 what should we expect that a strategy should contain in&#13;
&#13;
 itself, and also the collection of strategies when they&#13;
&#13;
 are ready.&#13;
&#13;
             I think in the retreat--I will mention this&#13;
&#13;
 again; I mentioned it already in a previous meeting--in&#13;
&#13;
 the retreat, Joanne proposed an interesting model of the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship between the CAS and the strategies as to how&#13;
&#13;
 the strategies would contain best practices and so on, and&#13;
&#13;
 the CASs would draw, and if we could adopt some type of&#13;
&#13;
 model, it would be good to guide the discussions and also&#13;
&#13;
 to guide the preparation, because the team has been&#13;
&#13;
 working for 20 months on this paper, and if it is not&#13;
&#13;
 exactly appropriate, then it is a big waste of resources&#13;
&#13;
 and time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         48&#13;
&#13;
           We would see this strategy as more narrowly&#13;
&#13;
 defined, maybe in the same way as Louis Holden did, than&#13;
&#13;
 too broadly.   I was a bit concerned when I saw an email&#13;
&#13;
 with proposals to include the whole Copenhagen agenda into&#13;
&#13;
 a single paper.   I think it would be quite complicated.&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe in the end, when we have all the strategies&#13;
&#13;
 together, they together could amount to something close to&#13;
&#13;
 the Copenhagen agenda, but to pretend that the whole&#13;
&#13;
 agenda would be in one, single paper, when at the same&#13;
&#13;
 time we have other strategies on other issues of the&#13;
&#13;
 Copenhagen agenda, for instance, on health and so on,&#13;
&#13;
 would be a bit messy.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it would be ideal if in the end, one&#13;
&#13;
 strategy put side-by-side with the others would make a&#13;
&#13;
 coherent thing, with not too many cross-references and too&#13;
&#13;
 many overlaps that could make it complicated to implement.&#13;
&#13;
           So we would see as the audience of the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 basically the client countries and to a great extent also&#13;
&#13;
 the Country Directors or the regions because they are the&#13;
&#13;
 ones who prepare the CASs together with the countries, and&#13;
&#13;
 then the strategies would provide some ways of doing&#13;
&#13;
 things in the particular field.&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              49&#13;
&#13;
           So in this sense, we think that this strategy&#13;
&#13;
 should be more narrowly defined than it is now.        We think&#13;
&#13;
 it is appropriate to say that the concept of social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management applies to a whole sphere of sectors--that is&#13;
&#13;
 fine--so to have a chapter saying how it applies in&#13;
&#13;
 financial service, how it applies in macro economy, and&#13;
&#13;
 how it applies elsewhere is fine.       But on the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation part, we think it should be more focused on&#13;
&#13;
 social protection per se and how things can be done there.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me give you an example.        We think that a&#13;
&#13;
 chapter containing a section on how to implement it&#13;
&#13;
 outside does not seem to be very credible.         For example,&#13;
&#13;
 on page 45, there is a reference to the financial sector,&#13;
&#13;
 and in the end, you have the phrase, "The social&#13;
&#13;
 protection sector will make sure that management of risk&#13;
&#13;
 is included as a critical element in designing&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic and financial sector interventions."        Well,&#13;
&#13;
 this is not credible.    First of all, macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 interventions are designed in the IMF and not even in the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank.   Financial sector interventions are designed&#13;
&#13;
 by a very highly specialized set of people, some of whom&#13;
&#13;
 are in the Bank, some of whom are outside the Bank in the&#13;
&#13;
 BIS and so on, so there is no credibility in such a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              50&#13;
&#13;
 phrase.   And I think most of the phrases in this chapter&#13;
&#13;
 are of that measure, so I would propose that we just&#13;
&#13;
 eliminate the chapter altogether, and instead of that,&#13;
&#13;
 expand on other areas that would contain information that&#13;
&#13;
 is relevant to governments that are convinced that they&#13;
&#13;
 should pursue the concept of social risk management.&#13;
&#13;
           For example, on page 25, in paragraph 66, there&#13;
&#13;
 is this paragraph on Latin America, and it says that in&#13;
&#13;
 the case of Latin American countries, a "more market-based&#13;
&#13;
 risk mitigation" would be more appropriate.        Suppose,&#13;
&#13;
 then, a Latin American government agrees with that and&#13;
&#13;
 would like to implement the social risk concept.       There is&#13;
&#13;
 no real clue in the whole document as to how that is&#13;
&#13;
 supposed to be done and what are the best practices, what&#13;
&#13;
 are the main elements of a more market-based risk&#13;
&#13;
 mitigation.&#13;
&#13;
           So we would see a strategy that to be&#13;
&#13;
 immediately useful--part of it can be advocacy, but if it&#13;
&#13;
 is mostly advocacy, you may have a problem, and I think we&#13;
&#13;
 are still grappling with this question whether the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 wants to--I think Management may, but also maybe to a&#13;
&#13;
 larger extent members of the Board--to what extent we&#13;
&#13;
 should devise new ways of coercing countries to adopt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           51&#13;
&#13;
 certain strategies even though we know that this whole&#13;
&#13;
 issue of   ownership is unavoidable; otherwise, it will not&#13;
&#13;
 be effective--or, should we accept the demand-driven&#13;
&#13;
 aspect.    And then, instead of trying to "coerce"--I put it&#13;
&#13;
 in quotations--trying to be too proactive and trying to&#13;
&#13;
 force countries to adopt it, we should have a very&#13;
&#13;
 convincing case where they can be convinced and then adopt&#13;
&#13;
 it.&#13;
&#13;
            So it would be much easier if you had a chapter&#13;
&#13;
 on how to implement market-based social protection&#13;
&#13;
 networks, and if we are convincing enough, they will adopt&#13;
&#13;
 it, or maybe not because of some other domestic--but at&#13;
&#13;
 least in many countries, I think they are willing to&#13;
&#13;
 adopt.&#13;
&#13;
            So this is the main problem that we see with the&#13;
&#13;
 paper.    For some issues, like core labor standards, they&#13;
&#13;
 are so controversial, and I wonder if, really, we should&#13;
&#13;
 keep insisting on this and trying to force countries to&#13;
&#13;
 this way or, as many countries have said, should we talk&#13;
&#13;
 about these things in the ILO.&#13;
&#13;
            The section on "Countries of Emphasis" also has&#13;
&#13;
 the same problem--should we emphasize countries from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

           MS. PIERCY:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I think this point about the fact that we have&#13;
&#13;
 not defined or at least come to closure on defining the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship between CASs and strategies, or indeed, the&#13;
&#13;
 collection of strategies that we will reach at one point&#13;
&#13;
 and CASs, is a point very well-taken.         As I think about&#13;
&#13;
 the point made earlier about the external as well as the&#13;
&#13;
 internal audiences for these strategies, there is a bit of&#13;
&#13;
 a risk that in terms of the external, those in the field,&#13;
&#13;
 who see these as very important instruments, can embrace&#13;
&#13;
 them, but they can create a set of expectations which,&#13;
&#13;
 when you then mediate this back through our Country&#13;
&#13;
 Assistance Strategy process and the priorities defined at&#13;
&#13;
 the country level, there are some tensions there.&#13;
&#13;
           I think this is an issue very much before us and&#13;
&#13;
 very much incumbent on the Board to press further, so I&#13;
&#13;
 think that is a very important flag.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
            MR. CHEBIL:   I will be very brief.     With the&#13;
&#13;
 wealth of information, there isn't much to add.&#13;
&#13;
            I have just two points.      On page 32, on the&#13;
&#13;
 section on "Social Risk Management and Community-Driven&#13;
&#13;
 Development," this chair believes strongly in the role of&#13;
&#13;
 community in enhancing development and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation.   But I think that as much as we like it, the&#13;
&#13;
 incorporation of that section didn't make clear to us the&#13;
&#13;
 links or how we would achieve community-driven development&#13;
&#13;
 with social risk management.      So I think we need more&#13;
&#13;
 elaboration also on lessons learned, especially as we are&#13;
&#13;
 aware of many programs in Latin America and Africa in that&#13;
&#13;
 respect.   I think you could strengthen that section.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, the social risk management has in the past&#13;
&#13;
 been mostly focused on the role of the government.       We are&#13;
&#13;
 wondering to what extent there is a possibility to&#13;
&#13;
 incorporate the role or the challenges of more private&#13;
&#13;
 sector involvement and whether there is a role for the IFC&#13;
&#13;
 in this.&#13;
&#13;
            And last but not least, we fully support Jan's&#13;
&#13;
 proposal for perhaps organizing an informal workshop for&#13;
&#13;
 further dissemination of lessons learned and other&#13;
&#13;
 practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             54&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Actually, we have concluded the comments by&#13;
&#13;
 Committee members, and I do have interest from others as&#13;
&#13;
 well joining in.&#13;
&#13;
           I am going to suggest that we first go back&#13;
&#13;
 briefly to the team, because I think there are some&#13;
&#13;
 important questions that are already on the table that&#13;
&#13;
 others may have as well, and then return to a further set&#13;
&#13;
 of comments, because you have quite a lot of questions&#13;
&#13;
 already extant.&#13;
&#13;
           I expect that possibly some of the expectations&#13;
&#13;
 that we have may be a matter of what is elaborated in the&#13;
&#13;
 papers that are at the regional level that are not on the&#13;
&#13;
 table today versus what you can include in a document at&#13;
&#13;
 this level--I am sure that's a judgment call.       I think we&#13;
&#13;
 would be very interested in looking at the regional&#13;
&#13;
 strategies as well at the appropriate point for&#13;
&#13;
 information, not so much for direct input except for those&#13;
&#13;
 Executive Directors involved with each region.&#13;
&#13;
           But let me turn it back to you now.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. JORGENSEN:     I'm not sure--we could go&#13;
&#13;
 through it--there are many questions, and I don't want to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            55&#13;
&#13;
 take the air time of the rest of you, so I will try to&#13;
&#13;
 answer some of them.    It is not that I am ignoring the&#13;
&#13;
 rest, but I'll try to see if I can sort of summarize some&#13;
&#13;
 of them without really getting into the details.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   That's fine.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. JORGENSEN:    On the whole issue of theme and&#13;
&#13;
 sector, we clearly see it more like some people said, as a&#13;
&#13;
 sector with some thematic overtones that has thematic&#13;
&#13;
 importance across several sectors.&#13;
&#13;
           I think you heard the debate here, which is&#13;
&#13;
 where we ended up coming down.      It is a judgment call how&#13;
&#13;
 much we cover that, how much do we make it explicit, how&#13;
&#13;
 much do we make the linkages implicit, and I think this is&#13;
&#13;
 our best guess at where we square the circle.      We would&#13;
&#13;
 welcome--we have struggled with this all along, and it&#13;
&#13;
 becomes even more difficult at a regional level, because&#13;
&#13;
 that is really where also the mix between the different&#13;
&#13;
 sectors, as was mentioned by the African representative,&#13;
&#13;
 is very important in terms of making sure that we don't&#13;
&#13;
 just talk about the formal as we used to in the past, but&#13;
&#13;
 that we really looking at the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
           So I think this is our best guess at how we make&#13;
&#13;
 that balance, and we will go back and reflect and see how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                 56&#13;
&#13;
 we can do this, but we would welcome the Committee's view&#13;
&#13;
 on that, and I think you have heard the discussion, that&#13;
&#13;
 it is really a tradeoff and a challenge.           We cannot cover&#13;
&#13;
 everything, because the document also gets longer and&#13;
&#13;
 longer, so it is difficult.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to say that the way we have defined it--&#13;
&#13;
 and then you can say that--is that there is a theme that&#13;
&#13;
 is called "risk management and vulnerability," and that&#13;
&#13;
 theme, as was said in one of the last interventions, does&#13;
&#13;
 influence, or we would like to influence the thinking in&#13;
&#13;
 other sectors, but it is absolutely correct that we cannot&#13;
&#13;
 guarantee that financial interventions or macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 reforms would put it in.&#13;
&#13;
           But that is where we see our advocacy role very&#13;
&#13;
 strongly, whether it is through the PRSP process or&#13;
&#13;
 whichever process at country level, other CDF processes,&#13;
&#13;
 is to make sure that risk and vulnerability is taken into&#13;
&#13;
 account in the overall discussion.        That's really where we&#13;
&#13;
 see our advocacy role very strongly.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, once that has happened, we also have a&#13;
&#13;
 sectoral responsibility, which is that there are certain&#13;
&#13;
 interventions that this Sector Board is responsible for&#13;
&#13;
 the quality of and so on within our traditional areas, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              57&#13;
&#13;
 we do propose some minor expansions in that area; but that&#13;
&#13;
 is really where we say this is what we are responsible for&#13;
&#13;
 as a sector, and that is where the chapters on social&#13;
&#13;
 protection as a sector comes in and discusses that.&#13;
&#13;
             We completely accept the comment on gender.     I&#13;
&#13;
 think when we discussed this with the Gender Board, there&#13;
&#13;
 was a sense that we had mainstreamed gender, but we will&#13;
&#13;
 make it much more explicit in a rewrite, and we will also&#13;
&#13;
 link it up in that chapter on the cross-cutting, because&#13;
&#13;
 it needs to come out as a cross-cutting theme much more&#13;
&#13;
 strongly.&#13;
&#13;
             The advocacy may also be linked to the whole&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of Country Directors.        We could have written a&#13;
&#13;
 paper that had said these are the countries of emphasis,&#13;
&#13;
 from purely the Sector Boards sitting down and saying&#13;
&#13;
 these are the countries of emphasis that we think should&#13;
&#13;
 be important, the supply side.       What we tried to do was&#13;
&#13;
 balance that supply side of where we think from a global&#13;
&#13;
 perspective, looking across countries, it would be&#13;
&#13;
 important to have a discussion on social protection on,&#13;
&#13;
 but balancing it with what we know are the interests of&#13;
&#13;
 countries and often as translated by Country Directors.&#13;
&#13;
 You have to realize that when you talk about budgets, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              58&#13;
&#13;
 majority of the budget for the social protection sector is&#13;
&#13;
 not the Network budget; it is the budget that is allocated&#13;
&#13;
 in the Regions to these sectors.&#13;
&#13;
           So that is why we have this matrix where we try&#13;
&#13;
 to say there is importance, and there is opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
 There is importance in terms of what we think.        And there&#13;
&#13;
 is a group of countries that we defined, but that is where&#13;
&#13;
 we had to be very, very selective, because we don't feel&#13;
&#13;
 that it is useful to identify lots of countries that are&#13;
&#13;
 important but where there is not a lot of interest.        We&#13;
&#13;
 identify a few and say these are what we call advocacy&#13;
&#13;
 countries; these are countries where we will work very&#13;
&#13;
 strongly on trying to put social protection more on the&#13;
&#13;
 agenda through the PRSP process, whatever.         But those&#13;
&#13;
 countries have to be relatively few, and those countries&#13;
&#13;
 are selected by our regional colleagues, not by the people&#13;
&#13;
 in the Anchor.   This is done based on regional&#13;
&#13;
 discussions.&#13;
&#13;
           I think there are relatively few countries in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa--that does not reflect that we are less interested&#13;
&#13;
 in Africa, but again it reflects the reality of what the&#13;
&#13;
 Africa Region feels is doable at this point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              59&#13;
&#13;
           Again, we didn't hear anybody argue against the&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on Africa, so we will certainly incorporate that.&#13;
&#13;
 I think to many of us, that is very welcome. I       also think&#13;
&#13;
 it is important to highlight what was mentioned, that this&#13;
&#13;
 is difficult, because in Africa, you are not dealing with&#13;
&#13;
 the formal systems which we know a lot about.       I think it&#13;
&#13;
 is very important that we know a lot about formal, we know&#13;
&#13;
 some about market, and we know relatively little as an&#13;
&#13;
 institution on informal.     And that is really linked to the&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity.&#13;
&#13;
           I feel like saying to you that you can't have it&#13;
&#13;
 both ways, but that is probably a bit too strong.      If we&#13;
&#13;
 really get way into informal, but which identifies a few&#13;
&#13;
 areas in informal where the Bank has some experience and&#13;
&#13;
 some comparative advantage where we could really feel that&#13;
&#13;
 we could move forward relatively quickly, which is on the&#13;
&#13;
 legal side, it is on using social funds--I'm sure Bob will&#13;
&#13;
 talk about the evaluation that is going on--but I think&#13;
&#13;
 those are areas where we feel we can do something.      We&#13;
&#13;
 know a lot about market.     We will work with our&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues.    We know a lot about microfinance in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 We will work with our colleagues in those areas.      But if&#13;
&#13;
 we go too far in that direction, we feel that we would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               60&#13;
&#13;
 moving outside our areas of comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
 relatively quickly.   But we will do it, and we will see&#13;
&#13;
 what happens, and this is where we cannot give you that&#13;
&#13;
 list of exactly what partners will do what in the next&#13;
&#13;
 three years.   There, we have chosen to outline a process&#13;
&#13;
 by which we will find out how that is done.        We could give&#13;
&#13;
 you a list of things, but it would have to be taken with&#13;
&#13;
 such large grains of salt that I think it would be an&#13;
&#13;
 inedible sort of potion that we would put in front of you.&#13;
&#13;
 To try to predict what will happen in three years in this&#13;
&#13;
 area that is a relatively new and growing area is very&#13;
&#13;
 difficult.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to emphasize that we have identified a&#13;
&#13;
 group of countries where we see our role as advocacy, and&#13;
&#13;
 an advocacy role of this paper we feel is to put risk and&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability into the debate.      If it comes out of that&#13;
&#13;
 debate as a country priority, we stand ready to support&#13;
&#13;
 specific sectoral interventions that can help do that, and&#13;
&#13;
 we stand ready to support other sectors within the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 and with other partners to move this forward.&#13;
&#13;
           And I can tell you in the discussions with&#13;
&#13;
 external partners, this area of theme and sector that you&#13;
&#13;
 also struggle with today has been right at the center of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                   61&#13;
&#13;
 the debate, and as I said, this is the compromise that we&#13;
&#13;
 came up with.&#13;
&#13;
           On the stock-taking, we very much welcome&#13;
&#13;
 specific suggestions on how to do more.            We have mined the&#13;
&#13;
 OED experience extensively.     The first reaction we got&#13;
&#13;
 from OED, I think I can admit saying, was we don't know&#13;
&#13;
 anything about social protection.       It turned out they&#13;
&#13;
 actually know quite a bit, and they did very good work in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of providing us with the background that is included&#13;
&#13;
 in one of the annexes.&#13;
&#13;
           We also included an annex on our experience with&#13;
&#13;
 pension reform specifically, because there was a request&#13;
&#13;
 from I guess an earlier generation of the Board to do&#13;
&#13;
 this, but that is in there as well; plus we provided&#13;
&#13;
 stock-taking of the current portfolio.         So we feel that we&#13;
&#13;
 have gone a long way, but the way I heard the discussion&#13;
&#13;
 it is that we haven't drawn the conclusions strongly&#13;
&#13;
 enough out of that.&#13;
&#13;
           But it is a bit hard to draw conclusions on a&#13;
&#13;
 new framework.   We felt that it was a bit unjust to judge&#13;
&#13;
 past operations who were designed under a different&#13;
&#13;
 framework, judge them on the new framework.           So that was&#13;
&#13;
 the difficulty we had.    But we will work on trying to put&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           62&#13;
&#13;
 more output, and will take any specific suggestions on how&#13;
&#13;
 to do the stock-taking in a better and more creative way.&#13;
&#13;
           I can also tell you we did look very carefully&#13;
&#13;
 at all the other Sector Strategy Papers, and the&#13;
&#13;
 inspiration was not as great as we would have hoped.&#13;
&#13;
           The informal sector is very important, we&#13;
&#13;
 recognize it, but like I said, there are a lot of areas&#13;
&#13;
 here where we just don't know; it is going to be an&#13;
&#13;
 exploratory work.    And like someone pointed out in written&#13;
&#13;
 comments, we really need to base this on a lot of the&#13;
&#13;
 experience of NGOs and more informal groups and some of&#13;
&#13;
 the bilaterals who have worked a lot on this, and we will&#13;
&#13;
 move forward as we go, but again, we felt it was not&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate to really outline a very detailed strategy in&#13;
&#13;
 this.   But basically, what it says is we know it is&#13;
&#13;
 important, and we will work on it, and this is how we will&#13;
&#13;
 work on it.&#13;
&#13;
           There are two specific issues where we have&#13;
&#13;
 tried to balance the things, and, really, a Board&#13;
&#13;
 discussion is the appropriate forum to discuss them. One&#13;
&#13;
 is core labor standards, especially on child labor.     What&#13;
&#13;
 you have in here, again, is what we felt was the balance&#13;
&#13;
 we heard, for instance, in the informal Board seminar.&#13;

&#13;
 There was strong division between some of the larger Part&#13;
&#13;
 2 countries who made some points, and some of the larger&#13;
&#13;
 Point 1 countries made other comments, so I think this is&#13;
&#13;
 an appropriate discussion for the Board to have, and we&#13;
&#13;
 will obviously reflect that discussion.&#13;
&#13;
             I can tell you we are doing the work that&#13;
&#13;
 someone requested on the links between core labor&#13;
&#13;
 standards and development more broadly, and it is joint&#13;
&#13;
 work with the International Confederation of Free Trade&#13;
&#13;
 Unions and with the ILO on this, because this is again an&#13;
&#13;
 area where there are other agencies that have more&#13;
&#13;
 experience than we do.&#13;
&#13;
             Similarly on the minimum public provision,&#13;
&#13;
 again, I think that is a policy recommendation that the&#13;
&#13;
 paper could come out with, but again, that is really your&#13;
&#13;
 decision and your discussion.       We did not feel that it was&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate, taking into account the fiscal situation of&#13;
&#13;
 many countries.    This would just be undoable, we felt.&#13;
&#13;
 But we may not have looked hard enough; we may have&#13;
&#13;
 underestimated what can be done with limited resources.&#13;
&#13;
 So again, those are two areas where we look to you for&#13;
&#13;
 guidance.&#13;

&#13;
           It would be very useful to hear from our&#13;
&#13;
 regional colleagues on how is this implemented and is it&#13;
&#13;
 really relevant to the different Regions.          Again, the&#13;
&#13;
 balance is how much do we put in here, and there is a&#13;
&#13;
 whole paper on Latin America, and there are country case&#13;
&#13;
 studies now in these six countries that show what this&#13;
&#13;
 really means for Latin American countries now in these six&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   We have them in two African countries.        So we&#13;
&#13;
 know in those countries, but it really looks quite&#13;
&#13;
 different, even between Benin and Togo, which are&#13;
&#13;
 neighboring countries and very similar--the conclusions do&#13;
&#13;
 look different.   And that is really the role of the&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Paper, is how much is it the detailed work&#13;
&#13;
 program and how much--someone mentioned the link between&#13;
&#13;
 the Strategy Paper and the CAS.       This Strategy Paper is&#13;
&#13;
 going to look quite different as implemented in different&#13;
&#13;
 places.&#13;
&#13;
           I think I will leave it there, and we can answer&#13;
&#13;
 all the specific questions, but we would like to hear from&#13;
&#13;
 you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   That is very helpful, thank you,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think will help us focus Board discussion on this as&#13;
&#13;
 well.&#13;

&#13;
           On the second one, the minimum public provision,&#13;
&#13;
 that even gets into an issue on the IMF, because it is a&#13;
&#13;
 question of whether donors are prepared to provide some of&#13;
&#13;
 the gap, but the IMF won't take into account the donor&#13;
&#13;
 supplements of the budget in terms of the fiscal targets,&#13;
&#13;
 that creates an additional pressure in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 minimum public provision, and that is probably an&#13;
&#13;
 important discussion to pursue further.&#13;
&#13;
           I think Bob Picciotto wanted to come in, and&#13;
&#13;
 then I'll return to my list of speakers.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PICCIOTTO:    First of all, on the technical&#13;
&#13;
 seminar that we are proposing, Sonya Carvalho is here, and&#13;
&#13;
 she can answer any questions to bring OED's views as they&#13;
&#13;
 stand at this stage on the social fund review.     The study&#13;
&#13;
 is due to CODE in May 2001.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to take this opportunity to share&#13;
&#13;
 with you some general reactions to the paper.      Let me say&#13;
&#13;
 that we found it a very interesting paper, a very good&#13;
&#13;
 paper, and OED's comments have been taken into account,&#13;
&#13;
 but my comments are more generic.&#13;
&#13;
           In a sense, if we go back to what is an SSP,&#13;
&#13;
 this is not an SSP, and it cannot be an SSP; essentially,&#13;
&#13;
 it is a concept paper, for the reasons I will outline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         66&#13;
&#13;
 Basically, this is a new field of Bank involvement.&#13;
&#13;
 Beyond   [?]   , like Mr. Jordan [ph.], we are doing it&#13;
&#13;
 without knowing it--I think there really is something new&#13;
&#13;
 there, and it is new in the sense that it is Strategic&#13;
&#13;
 Compact territory along with social development and along&#13;
&#13;
 with participation and things like that, and the&#13;
&#13;
 strengthening of public sector management.&#13;
&#13;
           The question, though, which I think is implicit&#13;
&#13;
 in many of the comments is really whether or not all these&#13;
&#13;
 various initiatives are coherent--what is the coherence in&#13;
&#13;
 the approach here.&#13;
&#13;
           There is a sense in which the themes of this&#13;
&#13;
 paper may or may not fit what is coming out of the Social&#13;
&#13;
 Development Group in   terms of social assessments, and&#13;
&#13;
 basically, this paper is devoid of--you mentioned social&#13;
&#13;
 capital, but social organization does not appear--in other&#13;
&#13;
 words, in many ways, it is not a multidisciplinary&#13;
&#13;
 approach, and the approach taken is a social risk&#13;
&#13;
 framework.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, OED has long argued that we should be much&#13;
&#13;
 more sensitive to risk analysis; indeed, our&#13;
&#13;
 sustainability rating is an awkward way, perhaps, but it&#13;
&#13;
 is one way of trying to grapple with the issue of risk,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                67&#13;
&#13;
 and we need to do more work on this, and we do agree with&#13;
&#13;
 the paper that we need to dialogue much more with the&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Board.&#13;
&#13;
           But risk analysis, we have found at the project&#13;
&#13;
 level, at the corporate level, is a peculiarly difficult&#13;
&#13;
 thing to do.    We have talked about doing risk analysis in&#13;
&#13;
 projects for 50 years, and it has not been done all that&#13;
&#13;
 well.   We have been talking about a corporate risk&#13;
&#13;
 management strategy in the Bank, and we're having a hell&#13;
&#13;
 of a time grappling with it.&#13;
&#13;
           So I think it is really a very bold stroke and I&#13;
&#13;
 think an appropriate one--I am not against it--but I think&#13;
&#13;
 we must understand how complex the thing is and how&#13;
&#13;
 important a genuine multidisciplinary approach is needed&#13;
&#13;
 to find the right balance precisely between informal&#13;
&#13;
 arrangements, market-based arrangements, and public&#13;
&#13;
 action.&#13;
&#13;
           Is the role of the state in this area--of&#13;
&#13;
 course, it varies from country to country--but what is the&#13;
&#13;
 policy?   Are we ready in the Bank to articulate a policy&#13;
&#13;
 in the social protection area, or is it too early?        That&#13;
&#13;
 is I think the fundamental question.         There is an implicit&#13;
&#13;
 tone of subsidiarity here, but one gets the sense that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         68&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps, as Matthias highlighted, it doesn't emphasize&#13;
&#13;
 enough the informal arrangements and social capital, and&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps it is a bit more state-directed than perhaps the&#13;
&#13;
 PSM strategy is.&#13;
&#13;
           These are questions.       It would be useful to&#13;
&#13;
 ensure, Eduardo, that it is clear what the limits of the&#13;
&#13;
 paper are, but how coherent it is with the other Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategies which are emerging, I think remains a question.&#13;
&#13;
           Generally speaking, there is a policy gap--we&#13;
&#13;
 have talked about the Sector Strategy doing four things--&#13;
&#13;
 policy, performance, programs, and partnerships.       On&#13;
&#13;
 policy, and given the fact that all Sector Strategy Papers&#13;
&#13;
 refer to poverty reduction as the overarching theme, all&#13;
&#13;
 SSPs are handicapped by the fact that we still haven't&#13;
&#13;
 sorted out what the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 is given that the WDR is yet to be finalized.       And&#13;
&#13;
 specifically here, this is one of the three pillars of the&#13;
&#13;
 new WDR--security.    But the tradeoff to security and&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment in particular and security and opportunity--&#13;
&#13;
 this is the point I was alluding to earlier--what is the&#13;
&#13;
 balance between social protection and the other Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  69&#13;
&#13;
           So there is a policy gap, and in fact, as you&#13;
&#13;
 have noted, there is no policy as far as I can tell, or&#13;
&#13;
 any policy document yet on this whole area.           The question,&#13;
&#13;
 though, it seems to me is when would it be appropriate--&#13;
&#13;
 while we don't have it now, when will we have a genuine&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Strategy.   I think I would be quite         [?]   to find&#13;
&#13;
 we don't have one now, because we don't have policies&#13;
&#13;
 without foundations.    But the fact is it would be useful&#13;
&#13;
 to have a plan which would provide the right connections&#13;
&#13;
 to the various elements of these Sector Strategies on the&#13;
&#13;
 policy side in particular.      And this is not only in&#13;
&#13;
 general but also with respect to pension reform, with&#13;
&#13;
 respect to social funds, with respect to labor markets,&#13;
&#13;
 and all the other specific subsectors in which this&#13;
&#13;
 activity is being conducted.&#13;
&#13;
           So, given the policy gap which reflects an&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation gap about which OED is partly responsible--I&#13;
&#13;
 think we admit that; we haven't done enough work on this--&#13;
&#13;
 I think research is gearing up and has done quite a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 good work, but I really think the timeÃ&#138;line of what needs&#13;
&#13;
 to be done to produce sharper strategies--because I must&#13;
&#13;
 say that I think the risk framework is essentially one way&#13;
&#13;
 of shielding our ignorance of the sector.           I think we need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           70&#13;
&#13;
 to be clear on what this really means in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 specific subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
           Given that, it is not surprising that the&#13;
&#13;
 program dimension and the partnership dimension are very&#13;
&#13;
 well-treated here but could not be treated more&#13;
&#13;
 specifically given the early state of the art in this&#13;
&#13;
 sector.   Again, I think it is an infant industry, and it&#13;
&#13;
 deserves to be protected.     I think it is a very important&#13;
&#13;
 thing for the future of the Bank, as many of you have&#13;
&#13;
 already highlighted, so the sector does deserve support,&#13;
&#13;
 and perhaps a lot of the questions cannot be answered&#13;
&#13;
 right away, but we need to create the atmosphere in which&#13;
&#13;
 there is genuine learning and genuine interaction between&#13;
&#13;
 all parts of the Bank on this very important thing which&#13;
&#13;
 has really changed the face of the Bank, the so-called&#13;
&#13;
 Bank with a human face.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I am going to go back to my list of speakers now&#13;
&#13;
 and call on Ms. Sayed.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. SAYED:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           We actually sent in some comments, maybe it's&#13;
&#13;
 about a month ago now, and I guess with all the changes of&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              71&#13;
&#13;
 the meetings and so on, they got lost in the shuffle.        So&#13;
&#13;
 I'll make a few points from those comments, because&#13;
&#13;
 already quite a bit has been said.&#13;
&#13;
           This chair feels that this is a very good,&#13;
&#13;
 though, and extensive strategy document, and we do want to&#13;
&#13;
 commend the authors for this in-depth view that they have&#13;
&#13;
 taken in a relatively new area of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           We found the concept of social risk management&#13;
&#13;
 to be intellectually challenging.       We like the link that&#13;
&#13;
 was made to poverty alleviation directly as well as the&#13;
&#13;
 link upward to macroeconomic policies.         Indeed, this is&#13;
&#13;
 something the PRSPs are struggling with as well as the CDF&#13;
&#13;
 and others; so we would certainly like to give credit to&#13;
&#13;
 the authors of this paper for this as well as for--I don't&#13;
&#13;
 know how strong it is--but at least for maybe giving birth&#13;
&#13;
 to one of the three pillars of the poverty WDR.        I think&#13;
&#13;
 that here also, some credit should be given to this paper.&#13;
&#13;
           We don't think that this risk management&#13;
&#13;
 approach is too narrow, actually.       Like others, indeed, if&#13;
&#13;
 we have any criticism of the concept, it is that it may be&#13;
&#13;
 a little bit too broad.    Spanning everything from exchange&#13;
&#13;
 rate policies to scholarships for the poor, the framework&#13;
&#13;
 may run the risk of not having focus and becoming&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                          72&#13;
&#13;
 operationally difficult to explain, let alone to&#13;
&#13;
 implement.   But overall, we actually agree with Louis&#13;
&#13;
 Holden on the broadness and attractiveness of this&#13;
&#13;
 concept.&#13;
&#13;
            One question we had was about the balancing of&#13;
&#13;
 the three strategies of the social risk management, the&#13;
&#13;
 prevention, mitigation, and coping.        We would be&#13;
&#13;
 interested in knowing a little bit of some good examples&#13;
&#13;
 or better practices of this; what some countries have done&#13;
&#13;
 in trying to balance these three strategies, either&#13;
&#13;
 developing or developed.    I think the paper may benefit&#13;
&#13;
 from putting in some more examples on that.&#13;
&#13;
            On the question of SSPs are meant to be strategy&#13;
&#13;
 documents versus financing, we actually found Chapter 8,&#13;
&#13;
 like Anna, to be a very good chapter, and again, one of&#13;
&#13;
 the first and few attempts of SSPs to do this kind of&#13;
&#13;
 assessment and getting down to something of a business&#13;
&#13;
 plan, because indeed the Board and the CODE have asked for&#13;
&#13;
 this in the past, so I think some credit is also due&#13;
&#13;
 there.&#13;
&#13;
            Personally, I think that going beyond that may&#13;
&#13;
 be difficult in these kinds of papers, and we may want to&#13;
&#13;
 discuss that at the Committee or the Subcommittee as to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 how something like this could be improved.           But we did&#13;
&#13;
 like Chapter 8.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, a very minor comment.           The document is&#13;
&#13;
 a bit long, and it is kind of difficult reading.           I know&#13;
&#13;
 the sector may find it difficult.       I am imagining a&#13;
&#13;
 Minister picking this up and trying to go through it.             So&#13;
&#13;
 whatever can be done to get this a little bit more&#13;
&#13;
 readable, with more country examples interspersed here and&#13;
&#13;
 there, may be beneficial.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           [Mr. Meyer assumed the chair.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:    Mr. Venghaus?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. VENGHAUS:    Thanks.&#13;
&#13;
           Just very briefly, we distributed our comments&#13;
&#13;
 electronically, so I am not going to repeat them here.            I&#13;
&#13;
 have just two issues.&#13;
&#13;
           One, we also found this a rather academic paper,&#13;
&#13;
 and perhaps a shorter and more readable version would be&#13;
&#13;
 highly appreciated from our side.       One aspect, social&#13;
&#13;
 protection and the role of information technology--I know&#13;
&#13;
 you are working on that, but it is not reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
 document, or perhaps you could just give some idea of how&#13;
&#13;
 that works together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                74&#13;
&#13;
           And following the discussion of today, I think&#13;
&#13;
 it would be really useful to have in the near future a&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on core labor standards and how to include that&#13;
&#13;
 in the Bank's work.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           We have now Mr. Nikitsenka.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. NIKITSENKA:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to say that our chair is very&#13;
&#13;
 interested in this paper, too, and we had today a staff&#13;
&#13;
 meeting dedicated to this discussion.         At this stage, I do&#13;
&#13;
 not want to repeat what has been said, but I would say&#13;
&#13;
 that my colleagues emphasized during our staff meeting the&#13;
&#13;
 importance of going to the experiences of the regions in&#13;
&#13;
 the countries, because social policies and social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy are very sensitive depending on where&#13;
&#13;
 you are--in the former Soviet Union, in Africa, or in&#13;
&#13;
 Latin America--and you can have social or historic&#13;
&#13;
 constraints which will determine where you can actually go&#13;
&#13;
 and cannot go.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, the question arises how far should the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank go in social protection, because if you look at page&#13;
&#13;
 9, you will see from the chart that the volume of social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                          75&#13;
&#13;
 protection lending has increased from the period 1992-1995&#13;
&#13;
 from $500 million to $3.5 billion, which means seven&#13;
&#13;
 times.   If you go at this pace, the Bank will appear to&#13;
&#13;
 become kind of a social insurance company, and two-thirds&#13;
&#13;
 of the lending already is linked to it.&#13;
&#13;
           Actually, the growth problem is one of the key&#13;
&#13;
 problems for creation of possibilities for fighting&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and social protection, and we feel that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should do more in creating possibilities in the countries&#13;
&#13;
 for the middle class to be an engine for higher living&#13;
&#13;
 standards.   In this area, the Bank should do more, so we&#13;
&#13;
 want to know if there is any perception in this strategy&#13;
&#13;
 about the ceilings and how far the Bank in principle can&#13;
&#13;
 go.&#13;
&#13;
           The last point relates to the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
 We feel that today the informal sector has become more and&#13;
&#13;
 more important, both because we have a lot of post-&#13;
&#13;
 conflict countries; and second, in the former Soviet&#13;
&#13;
 Union, in countries like Ukraine, say, we believe that&#13;
&#13;
 more than half the GDP is produced by the informal sector,&#13;
&#13;
 and if nobody actually takes into account social&#13;
&#13;
 protection for people who are producing wealth, actually,&#13;
&#13;
 informally, then who will do it?       The Bank is the only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               76&#13;
&#13;
 institution which can actually take care of this problem.&#13;
&#13;
 The government, of course, which deals with the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
 should not take the main responsibility for the informal&#13;
&#13;
 sector.   We strongly recommend that this issue be taken&#13;
&#13;
 care of very thoroughly.      Instead of just putting that it&#13;
&#13;
 is important, the strategy should be clear-cut what the&#13;
&#13;
 government should do in this area and how and what is the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's role.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER: Which would imply that we would have&#13;
&#13;
 regional strategies, I guess, which are more specific than&#13;
&#13;
 what we have now.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. NIKITSENKA:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:     Mr. Chen?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. CHEN:    Thank you, Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me start by thanking staff for this&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive and informative report.           I will be brief.&#13;
&#13;
           First, on informal instruments and social funds,&#13;
&#13;
 I associate myself with the view that Ms. Jan Piercy&#13;
&#13;
 circulated in her email last week, that some evaluation on&#13;
&#13;
 the effectiveness of social funds should be conducted&#13;
&#13;
 before we could further decide on scaling up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  77&#13;
&#13;
           On financing needs, I also agree with Jan's&#13;
&#13;
 email that approval of budget financing should be made as&#13;
&#13;
 part of an overall Bank strategy exercise, and&#13;
&#13;
 consultation with borrowing countries on the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 should be conducted.&#13;
&#13;
           In addition, I think that some study on&#13;
&#13;
 developed countries' experience in social protection seems&#13;
&#13;
 very much needed.&#13;
&#13;
           On labor standards, I wonder if it is the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 mandate to deal with the labor standards issue.             I&#13;
&#13;
 remember that many Ministers expressed strong reservations&#13;
&#13;
 on this issue during previous Annual Meetings and&#13;
&#13;
 Development Committee meetings, and also, quite a few&#13;
&#13;
 Executive Directors indicated their concerns on several&#13;
&#13;
 occasions.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that the Bank should follow the lead of&#13;
&#13;
 the ILO and UNICEF on labor standards and child labor&#13;
&#13;
 issues, rather than to intervene in these issues too much.&#13;
&#13;
           On selectivity, I share the views on selectivity&#13;
&#13;
 expressed by previous chairs.        Nowadays, many people talk&#13;
&#13;
 about selectivity, but few mention how to implement the&#13;
&#13;
 principle of selectivity into practice.              So I think the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank is charged with more and more responsibilities and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             78&#13;
&#13;
 activities, and the problem is how do we put the principle&#13;
&#13;
 of selectivity into practice.&#13;
&#13;
             In particular, I support the proposal made by&#13;
&#13;
 the Brazilian chair that the strategy should be narrowly&#13;
&#13;
 defined, with a focus on carefully identifying issues to&#13;
&#13;
 make the strategy more implementable, and I also share the&#13;
&#13;
 Saudi chair's view that we should be more realistic on the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of this very complicated strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. MEYER:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Now, we have Mr. Rivera.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. RIVERA:   Thank you, Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             I like very much the innovative character of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy as well as that it is, in a nutshell, CDF-&#13;
&#13;
 correct.    It clearly applies all the principles of the&#13;
&#13;
 CDF.   As Mr. Picciotto said, this is just an emerging&#13;
&#13;
 topic; it is very new, and therefore, the strategy is a&#13;
&#13;
 little bit up in the air and has to come down.      And please&#13;
&#13;
 don't take my comments as too critical, but this is what I&#13;
&#13;
 am trying to elaborate a little bit.&#13;
&#13;
             I think the strategy is too broad in scope on&#13;
&#13;
 one side, and on the other side, it is too narrow in&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    Mr. Balduino clearly explained to us why it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                79&#13;
&#13;
 too broad in scope.     It tries to capture macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 risk management, financial analysis risk management, which&#13;
&#13;
 are at the core of dealing with stabilization in the&#13;
&#13;
 financial sector and in the macro, and it tries to apply&#13;
&#13;
 this also to the social sectors.         It is too narrow in&#13;
&#13;
 scope, in approach, because for example, there are lots of&#13;
&#13;
 labor market issues that don't need stochastic approaches&#13;
&#13;
 to be dealt with.&#13;
&#13;
            In particular, let me tell you that in Latin&#13;
&#13;
 America--and in Africa, it is probably also the case--but&#13;
&#13;
 in Latin America, labor markets are half and half, more or&#13;
&#13;
 less, informal and formal.       And talking about labor&#13;
&#13;
 standards, the formal sector is overregulated, has too&#13;
&#13;
 many standards, and is very inflexible, and that is why&#13;
&#13;
 the employment problem is so large in Latin America.            I&#13;
&#13;
 think Costa Rica is a case-in-point, and also, Argentina&#13;
&#13;
 has a very big issue of the overregulation of labor&#13;
&#13;
 markets.   So flexibility is very important as well as&#13;
&#13;
 deregulation.&#13;
&#13;
            For example, on the safety net, a very big issue&#13;
&#13;
 is the management of safety nets and the incentive&#13;
&#13;
 structure to put the safety nets in place.           This has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                80&#13;
&#13;
 little to do with uncertainty and the risk management&#13;
&#13;
 approach to social protection.&#13;
&#13;
           I also think that the strategy has not taken&#13;
&#13;
 very well stock of the evidence.        When I attended the last&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation seminar in OED, there were a couple of people&#13;
&#13;
 from MIT who were very good, who were doing evaluation of&#13;
&#13;
 social safety nets, and they came up with the following&#13;
&#13;
 conclusion.   There are perverse incentives in the&#13;
&#13;
 formation and the production of safety nets.           On the one&#13;
&#13;
 hand, the governments love safety nets because they are&#13;
&#13;
 quick money that they can utilize to get political&#13;
&#13;
 dividends.    On the other hand, staff also loves safety&#13;
&#13;
 nets, because they immediately have the ownership of the&#13;
&#13;
 government, and they can pass the projects very quickly&#13;
&#13;
 through the Board and get them approved.            Everybody is&#13;
&#13;
 happy, but the poverty reduction impact, and especially&#13;
&#13;
 the permanent impact on poverty reduction of the safety&#13;
&#13;
 nets is very dubious, to say the least.&#13;
&#13;
           Those are my two comments.         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we can get back to staff for a&#13;
&#13;
 second short round, because we do have very little time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               81&#13;
&#13;
 for a second topic this afternoon, so we are already in&#13;
&#13;
 this meeting running into resource problems.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't know how you want to organize it, but&#13;
&#13;
 please go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HOLZMANN:     Mr. Chairman, if you would allow-&#13;
&#13;
 -because one of the comments raised the buy-in from other&#13;
&#13;
 sectors--if you could give two minutes to the Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Board as well as Ashras and the Social Development Boards&#13;
&#13;
 about that buy-in, because that was raised, simply to put&#13;
&#13;
 this away from the discussion so we can concentrate on&#13;
&#13;
 something else.&#13;
&#13;
           Tamar?&#13;
&#13;
           MS. ATINC:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           My name is Tamar Atinc, and I am acting for Mike&#13;
&#13;
 Walton, the Poverty Director.&#13;
&#13;
           Actually, a lot of people have already commented&#13;
&#13;
 on the linkage between poverty and Poverty Reduction&#13;
&#13;
 Strategies and the Social Protection Strategy Paper.        Both&#13;
&#13;
 in process and in content, there was a lot of interaction&#13;
&#13;
 between the Poverty Board and in general, people working&#13;
&#13;
 on issues of poverty reduction in the Bank and the Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Board on Social Protection.      And as other people have&#13;
&#13;
 commented, the World Development Report has also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                            82&#13;
&#13;
 benefitted from this collaboration.        Actually, the&#13;
&#13;
 development of this pillar as one of the three pillars of&#13;
&#13;
 the World Development Report benefitted greatly from the&#13;
&#13;
 work that was undertaken by our colleagues in writing the&#13;
&#13;
 Social Risk Management Framework.&#13;
&#13;
           So there has been extensive discussion on this&#13;
&#13;
 concept at the Poverty Board, and we fully endorse the&#13;
&#13;
 direction that our colleagues have taken on board.&#13;
&#13;
           There have been a number of discussions about&#13;
&#13;
 the application of the framework, and I think some&#13;
&#13;
 Executive Directors have commented as well on this,&#13;
&#13;
 whether it is too broad or too narrow.         At the Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Board, we see the clear linkages between the Social Risk&#13;
&#13;
 Management Framework and the broader goal of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Where we had some misgivings was in the broad&#13;
&#13;
 application of the Social Risk Management Framework.        I&#13;
&#13;
 think we are ending up having too many overall frameworks&#13;
&#13;
 in the Bank, and with the Social Risk Management Framework&#13;
&#13;
 and its broad application, we might yet again be risking&#13;
&#13;
 establishing yet another broad framework that takes&#13;
&#13;
 precedence over everything else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
           So we would be in favor of a somewhat more&#13;
&#13;
 limited application of the framework, and personally--I&#13;
&#13;
 don't know if I speak for Mike Walton in this case--but I&#13;
&#13;
 do like the interpretation of the social risk management&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of the concept of vulnerability, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
 see it as one of the three pillars of the Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Reduction Strategy as articulated in the World Development&#13;
&#13;
 Framework.&#13;
&#13;
           There are certainly linkages to the other two&#13;
&#13;
 pillars, but again I think we overdo it by linking&#13;
&#13;
 everything to everything else.      There is something to be&#13;
&#13;
 said for defining and delimiting concepts to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Who is next?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. GHANI:   My name is Ashras Ghani, and I am&#13;
&#13;
 from the Social Development Anchor.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to bring to your attention that the&#13;
&#13;
 Social Development Family has been extensively involved in&#13;
&#13;
 the dialogue on social protection, and the way we have&#13;
&#13;
 approached it is that this is a very useful framework, but&#13;
&#13;
 at a very general level of abstraction, as a framework&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily has to be, and its translation into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                         84&#13;
&#13;
 implementation requires understanding of context, it&#13;
&#13;
 requires understanding of social relationships, and that&#13;
&#13;
 is how we see the linkage with social capital on the one&#13;
&#13;
 hand, and with empowerment and opportunity on the other.&#13;
&#13;
 The way we approach it, we see that analysis of the social&#13;
&#13;
 risk is the first step toward going to address the&#13;
&#13;
 question of empowerment.    If the risks to people are not&#13;
&#13;
 sufficiently underlined, and the sources of those risks&#13;
&#13;
 are not identified as to whether they reside in the social&#13;
&#13;
 structure, in the governance systems, or in the economy,&#13;
&#13;
 we will not be able to come with strategies of empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 that are really grounded in context.&#13;
&#13;
           The same applies to questions of opportunity--&#13;
&#13;
 namely, what are the constraints, and how would we propose&#13;
&#13;
 overcoming those constraints in very specific ways.&#13;
&#13;
           As far as the question that Mr. Picciotto raised&#13;
&#13;
 regarding linkage between social risk management and&#13;
&#13;
 social assessments, one thing that social assessments do&#13;
&#13;
 is to assess from the perspective of the user their access&#13;
&#13;
 to the system, whether it is benefits or whether overall&#13;
&#13;
 participation, and the key to that again is to ground this&#13;
&#13;
 in an analysis of risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               85&#13;
&#13;
           So we see this as being very useful to enable us&#13;
&#13;
 to move forward.   The question, of course, is that in&#13;
&#13;
 practice, it means multiple levels, and that is where the&#13;
&#13;
 question of broadness and narrowness really becomes a key&#13;
&#13;
 challenge--in other words, how do we balance an approach&#13;
&#13;
 that is quite broad in theoretical terms with something&#13;
&#13;
 that is very concrete operationally.         Hence, we have been&#13;
&#13;
 collaborating with social protection to gather the type of&#13;
&#13;
 evidence both from developed countries and from developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries in terms of what is the best mix.         And of&#13;
&#13;
 course, the key question there is affordability, because&#13;
&#13;
 what has come from the experience of the developed&#13;
&#13;
 countries is that since the eighties, people have been&#13;
&#13;
 refusing to pay their taxes to underwrite expansion of the&#13;
&#13;
 social protection.    So it has become an overall challenge&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of balancing those versus the types of&#13;
&#13;
 situations; and the other is, of course, the slogan of how&#13;
&#13;
 do we do more with less, which is the question of&#13;
&#13;
 efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
           It is in those regards that we are collaborating&#13;
&#13;
 across a series of Bank instruments from investment&#13;
&#13;
 projects to structural adjustment to see how this&#13;
&#13;
 framework can be translated into very concrete operations.&#13;

&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Yes, go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. JORGENSEN:    I think I owe some specific&#13;
&#13;
 answers, or to say what will we do, what did we take out&#13;
&#13;
 of here, and the specific changes that we will go back and&#13;
&#13;
 do.   So I will go through that briefly,           if that's okay,&#13;
&#13;
 and then Bob Holzmann will try to link it up.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to start where he is going to start.           I&#13;
&#13;
 really think that a detailed discussion of the fantastic&#13;
&#13;
 amount of regional work that has been done by our&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues here could really be useful, because that is&#13;
&#13;
 really where the strategy translates into action.           It is&#13;
&#13;
 very hard to do, especially if we are going to write a&#13;
&#13;
 shorter document and have more country examples and then&#13;
&#13;
 also make it specific to the very wide variety of&#13;
&#13;
 situations, and I think the comments reflect that very&#13;
&#13;
 well.&#13;
&#13;
           We will make a better cross-connection to&#13;
&#13;
 gender.   We have commitment from our colleagues in the&#13;
&#13;
 gender family that they will help us write it so it is&#13;
&#13;
 better.&#13;
&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                 87&#13;
&#13;
           We will reflect the fact that it is the whole&#13;
&#13;
 international community that owns the PRSP process.&#13;
&#13;
           We will make better linkages to Copenhagen.         I&#13;
&#13;
 think it has become quite clear that we don't have to deal&#13;
&#13;
 with everything, but we will make the linkages very&#13;
&#13;
 clearly, and better links to Geneva 2000.          We are actually&#13;
&#13;
 co-authors on the Geneva 2000 paper, so I hope there is no&#13;
&#13;
 inconsistency, because then I think it is inconsistency in&#13;
&#13;
 my head, among other things. So I hope it is there, but we&#13;
&#13;
 will go back and make absolutely sure that this is&#13;
&#13;
 reflected.   Also, things have changed in the last two&#13;
&#13;
 months since we wrote this draft, and in a sense, Geneva&#13;
&#13;
 2000 is a moving target in that aspect.&#13;
&#13;
           We will make cross-references where appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 to the other Sector Strategies that exist or are under&#13;
&#13;
 development, so we'll say this is really where that topic&#13;
&#13;
 will be dealt with, but make the reference and not pretend&#13;
&#13;
 to be writing the Financial Sector Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           We will try to draw more specific lessons from&#13;
&#13;
 the stock-taking, and we will try to see what are the&#13;
&#13;
 specific things--we will mine the data more, and I'm sure&#13;
&#13;
 we can rely on assistance from our OED colleagues in doing&#13;
&#13;
 that further.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
            Someone mentioned the links with IFC and MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
 This has been discussed with the IFC and MIGA, and we&#13;
&#13;
 received very little feedback from them.           But as we get&#13;
&#13;
 more into the private sector, as the whole issue of&#13;
&#13;
 community development, for instance, is also being taken&#13;
&#13;
 up by IFC, I think there will be more and more interfaces.&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe we need to ask the question again to just make&#13;
&#13;
 absolutely sure that they are still doing that; that is at&#13;
&#13;
 least what we would propose to do on that.&#13;
&#13;
            On the implementation, I think we tried to&#13;
&#13;
 strike a balance and be realistic on what is in there, and&#13;
&#13;
 that is the indicators.    I hope we are a little more than&#13;
&#13;
 an infant industry, but we certainly don't have all the&#13;
&#13;
 answers at this point, but we will again go back and&#13;
&#13;
 discuss.   This really comes out of the regions in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 making absolutely sure that those indicators are correct,&#13;
&#13;
 but they were, like I said, four months ago.&#13;
&#13;
            On the social fund evaluation, I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 important to stress that we don't go into this cold.          We&#13;
&#13;
 have just completed jointly with the PREM Poverty Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Board a six-country evaluation of the impact on service&#13;
&#13;
 deliver and sustainability and poverty targeting of social&#13;
&#13;
 funds.   So we aren't going into this cold, but we will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                          89&#13;
&#13;
 make the cross-reference.     In fact, OED is basing their&#13;
&#13;
 assessment on that evaluation and taking it further and&#13;
&#13;
 looking at more specific institutional issues, but we will&#13;
&#13;
 make that cross-reference so it is clear that we aren't&#13;
&#13;
 going into this blind.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, we will make the links to micro finance&#13;
&#13;
 and disaster management more explicitly.&#13;
&#13;
           We will review the sections on the informal to&#13;
&#13;
 see what more we can say, but I want to emphasize that we&#13;
&#13;
 are quite clear that we don't have all the answers in this&#13;
&#13;
 area, and it is something we need to go on an exploratory.&#13;
&#13;
 But again, the regional discussions will bring that out&#13;
&#13;
 more clearly.&#13;
&#13;
           We will certainly make clearer linkages to the&#13;
&#13;
 community-driven development, and we are sorry if that&#13;
&#13;
 didn't come across strongly enough.&#13;
&#13;
           We will try to give more examples, but again,&#13;
&#13;
 this is really in our view better done in the regional&#13;
&#13;
 paper.   It is always a challenge, because we want a short,&#13;
&#13;
 crisp document, but it also has to be interesting.     We&#13;
&#13;
 will strive to put more in, but there is a tradeoff&#13;
&#13;
 between that and length at some point.&#13;

&#13;
           What is the limit to social protection--we will&#13;
&#13;
 address that; how far can we go.       We are one of the&#13;
&#13;
 sectors that is very happy when our lending numbers drop,&#13;
&#13;
 because it means that there is less crisis in the world,&#13;
&#13;
 because like someone said, safety nets are big--temporary&#13;
&#13;
 interventions are a big part of that hump you see in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of lending numbers.   In fact, we agree that it is both too&#13;
&#13;
 narrow and too broad.    I think that many of the labor&#13;
&#13;
 market issues go beyond risk.      That is why we have a dual&#13;
&#13;
 definition of risk and protection.&#13;
&#13;
           On core labor standards, I don't think anybody&#13;
&#13;
 would disagree with the statement that we need to make&#13;
&#13;
 labor markets more inclusive and nondiscriminatory.        I&#13;
&#13;
 think if we can keep the debate around the development&#13;
&#13;
 issues, that is what we propose to do, not specifically&#13;
&#13;
 address labor standards--but that again is a discussion&#13;
&#13;
 that I would encourage you to have, and we will reflect&#13;
&#13;
 whatever the outcome is.    But that is why we focused on&#13;
&#13;
 that, on the inclusiveness and on the links.       That is what&#13;
&#13;
 links us to growth.   And that is exactly why we want to&#13;
&#13;
 expand the framework, because we feel that, as has been&#13;
&#13;
 the experience with safety nets, if they are just designed&#13;
&#13;
 to cope as temporary measures they will not really reduce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                91&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.   That is why we are trying to move from the&#13;
&#13;
 safety net to the spring board.       There are actually some&#13;
&#13;
 very interesting examples in Latin America and in Mexico&#13;
&#13;
 of programs that try to do both--provide the temporary but&#13;
&#13;
 also the more permanent poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            Those are some of the specific things that I&#13;
&#13;
 will do, and we will go back and rework this based on&#13;
&#13;
 those things, and then, I think the regional dimension&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be brought out at some point.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. HOLZMANN:   There is little more to add to&#13;
&#13;
 this already good summing up.      I think I would link up&#13;
&#13;
 what I stopped saying in my introduction.          This is the&#13;
&#13;
 beginning and not the end of development of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   Since it is a new sector, and we are trying a&#13;
&#13;
 new approach which in our view--and also, everything we&#13;
&#13;
 have heard from our international partners--is better able&#13;
&#13;
 to lead to sustainable poverty reduction.          We cannot have&#13;
&#13;
 all the answers at the very beginning.         It is something&#13;
&#13;
 which was also reflected in the many discussions which we&#13;
&#13;
 had; it is the beginning of the process, not the end of&#13;
&#13;
 it.&#13;
&#13;
            In order to do a step forward, what we need from&#13;
&#13;
 you is now to give a clearer delineation of where you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               92&#13;
&#13;
 think we should move.    I have heard many good comments,&#13;
&#13;
 and I agree with most of them, but the question is where&#13;
&#13;
 do you see us coming out, and here, I would like to get a&#13;
&#13;
 bit more guidance at the level of selectivity, since we&#13;
&#13;
 had a very animated discussion with Ms. Brandt, and if we&#13;
&#13;
 were to introduce her whole list, the paper would double&#13;
&#13;
 and not halve, as some of them require, so I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 see where we should move.&#13;
&#13;
           The second issue has to do with accountability.&#13;
&#13;
 The question came up that it is the Bank's Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 Paper, and I agree with that, but at the end of the day,&#13;
&#13;
 it is the Board which is accountable, so accountable in&#13;
&#13;
 the sense that if we promise something in the paper, the&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Strategy Board has to deliver.         So the breadth of&#13;
&#13;
 our involvement and the accountability must be linked with&#13;
&#13;
 the budget, and that is the reason why we included&#13;
&#13;
 something about what we can do under certain budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 provisions and what we cannot do.       This is simply to tell&#13;
&#13;
 you where we are able to move and not able to move.&#13;
&#13;
           A second point I would like to make is that I&#13;
&#13;
 followed very closely the discussion in the Boards with&#13;
&#13;
 regard to Sector Strategy Papers and CASs, and Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Papers versus policy papers.         I understand it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                 93&#13;
&#13;
 the Strategy Paper which highlights the broad directions&#13;
&#13;
 and comes down with a few examples, but it is not a policy&#13;
&#13;
 paper, which details for each of the areas, like pension,&#13;
&#13;
 labor market, whatever it is, what actually needs to be&#13;
&#13;
 done.&#13;
&#13;
           This is unfortunate--we would like to do it--but&#13;
&#13;
 this would be a much longer exercise of many more years.&#13;
&#13;
 I think, based on the Strategy Paper, then, policy papers&#13;
&#13;
 do emerge, and some of the products in this direction, we&#13;
&#13;
 have out in the area of pensions the        [?]    product, we can&#13;
&#13;
 look at the Board, which essentially tries to distill the&#13;
&#13;
 experiences in this area and then puts forward policy&#13;
&#13;
 direction, and we want to do the same in the labor market,&#13;
&#13;
 social funds, and social safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
           Since the regional papers are very important, I&#13;
&#13;
 really encourage the Board and CODE to stage a discussion&#13;
&#13;
 of the regional experiences early on before we start with&#13;
&#13;
 the rewrite, because the discussion there and your&#13;
&#13;
 understanding would help us in order to find out where you&#13;
&#13;
 want to do more at the global strategy paper and where you&#13;
&#13;
 want some of the regional strategy papers to broaden.&#13;
&#13;
           Three areas are mentioned where essentially it&#13;
&#13;
 is your discussion that we would take on board for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             94&#13;
&#13;
 rewriting the paper on core labor standards.       Here, our&#13;
&#13;
 view was that we reflect what is roughly the broad&#13;
&#13;
 compromise decision, which is not enough for some and too&#13;
&#13;
 much for others, but that we develop a complementary&#13;
&#13;
 position on labor standards, trying to find out where&#13;
&#13;
 voluntary standards stand and what can be done.      Voluntary&#13;
&#13;
 standards or market-driven standards are a very important&#13;
&#13;
 new development, and just this morning, we had a three-&#13;
&#13;
 hour seminar on voluntary standards and what can be done.&#13;
&#13;
 This is something where we wanted to link up also with ILO&#13;
&#13;
 and with the institutions who are doing it, because I&#13;
&#13;
 think this is something which is closer to the&#13;
&#13;
 arrangements of the Bank, to the Articles of Agreement,&#13;
&#13;
 and this is something which is perhaps less intrusive.&#13;
&#13;
           A second one, a discussion where you see the&#13;
&#13;
 role of the government is the discussion we had with Ms.&#13;
&#13;
 Brandt about minimum provisions, where we have the feeling&#13;
&#13;
 that if a request or a demand is made on countries of&#13;
&#13;
 minimum provisions, the financial resources must be there;&#13;
&#13;
 if the are not there, providing guarantees for minimum&#13;
&#13;
 provisions can be counterproductive, and we would very&#13;
&#13;
 much like the guidance of the Board there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               95&#13;
&#13;
           And last but not least, the advocacy role versus&#13;
&#13;
 the sector role, or the thematic role versus the role&#13;
&#13;
 which is limited to social protection.         I also heard from&#13;
&#13;
 the chair about you should not talk about macroeconomics,&#13;
&#13;
 you should not talk about inflation, important as it is.&#13;
&#13;
 But I recall clearly the discussions with client countries&#13;
&#13;
 or with groups in client countries where they will say,&#13;
&#13;
 "If we hadn't had this inflation of 400 percent, with our&#13;
&#13;
 informal mechanism, we would have been able to cope well;&#13;
&#13;
 it was the macroeconomic development which got us into&#13;
&#13;
 this mess."&#13;
&#13;
           I think this is something that we always have to&#13;
&#13;
 alert politicians about, that macroeconomic stability is&#13;
&#13;
 very important, and to do social protection afterward, we&#13;
&#13;
 are only cleaning up; we are not able to get people out in&#13;
&#13;
 the long run.&#13;
&#13;
           So on the three areas, we would like to get your&#13;
&#13;
 guidance, and on the seminar, I am looking forward,&#13;
&#13;
 because I think this would provide you with more&#13;
&#13;
 understanding of how far the Sector Strategy has already&#13;
&#13;
 had impacts in regions as well as on countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you very much for all of your comments.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
           I think we have to sum up now.           I am a little&#13;
&#13;
 bit uneasy about this discussion--sorry--Mr. Balduino, go&#13;
&#13;
 ahead.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BALDUINO:    I'm sorry.      Just one point.    I&#13;
&#13;
 think the interventions of the two sectors reenforce even&#13;
&#13;
 more my impression that there is a level of generality&#13;
&#13;
 still far from implementability.       I am thinking of Bob's&#13;
&#13;
 intervention that this looks more like a concept paper&#13;
&#13;
 really than a strategy.    It just occurred to me that maybe&#13;
&#13;
 it is that, and maybe we should say that instead of a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy--or are those just words?        To what extent should&#13;
&#13;
 we try to be coherent with our different concepts and&#13;
&#13;
 apply them appropriately or not in that case?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   This is exactly the uneasiness I&#13;
&#13;
 wanted to express.&#13;
&#13;
           Who else wants to come in on this?          Yes, Koen?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DAVIDSE:    I have another point.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   Okay.    Mr. Underwood, first, and&#13;
&#13;
 then Koen has another point.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. UNDERWOOD:    Exactly on this point, I think&#13;
&#13;
 the idea behind Sector Strategy Papers is that in some&#13;
&#13;
 sense they are living documents.       You do them, you&#13;
&#13;
 implement them, you get feedback from what happened and go&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              97&#13;
&#13;
 on.   This is the first one but certainly not the last&#13;
&#13;
 Sector Strategy Paper in this area.          It is a starting&#13;
&#13;
 point.   So in our view, it is a Strategy Paper more than a&#13;
&#13;
 concept paper.   It is the first Strategy Paper in a new&#13;
&#13;
 area.    We are trying some new things, but I think it fits&#13;
&#13;
 well with what we have thought of Strategy Papers in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of this is--as the point that Ms. Brandt was making--this&#13;
&#13;
 is Management-endorsed; by the time it gets here, this is&#13;
&#13;
 something that Management agrees to.          We do not send&#13;
&#13;
 Strategy Papers forward until that is true.&#13;
&#13;
            It is a corporate priority--now, that doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 mean that it is a priority of every country, getting back&#13;
&#13;
 to the CAS issue.    We make choices at the CAS level of&#13;
&#13;
 whether this particular instrument is one that we are&#13;
&#13;
 going to use.    But I don't think we would want to pull&#13;
&#13;
 back and just call this a concept paper.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. MEYER:    Koen?&#13;
&#13;
            MR. DAVIDSE:    Two points.       First of all, I am&#13;
&#13;
 glad to hear it is a corporate priority, but I still get&#13;
&#13;
 the impression from the presentations that the Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Board is telling us we could do this with that kind of&#13;
&#13;
 money, and we could do that with this kind of money, and&#13;
&#13;
 that gives us the impression that we have a choice in how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                98&#13;
&#13;
 far it is a priority.       We really would like, by the time&#13;
&#13;
 we discuss it at the Board, a clear Management view on how&#13;
&#13;
 far this is a priority, because the parts on the&#13;
&#13;
 constraints in the paper are very relevant, but it needs&#13;
&#13;
 to be resolved, and I think it needs to be resolved at the&#13;
&#13;
 Management level, and the Board will express itself on&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
            And the second point, if I may, I was very&#13;
&#13;
 interested to hear on labor standards what Robert Holzmann&#13;
&#13;
 said on voluntary standards.         I vividly remember&#13;
&#13;
 discussions when I was in India between UNICEF and ILO on&#13;
&#13;
 private sector standards, where UNICEF basically supported&#13;
&#13;
 private sector carpet labels, and ILO said, "This is not&#13;
&#13;
 our role; it is a private sector issue."              So I wonder&#13;
&#13;
 whether the Bank really has a role in that kind of&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, but maybe I misunderstood.&#13;
&#13;
            Thanks.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. MEYER:     I think we really have to sum up&#13;
&#13;
 now, and I hope I express the view of most of you when I&#13;
&#13;
 say that this is an extremely interesting and obviously&#13;
&#13;
 well-thought-through paper you have presented.             At the&#13;
&#13;
 same time, we have a very hard time to know what to do&#13;
&#13;
 with it.   If the same paper appears at the Board, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                              (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               99&#13;
&#13;
 Board approves it, what does it really mean for the future&#13;
&#13;
 of this type of activity as part of all the other&#13;
&#13;
 activities of the Bank is not quite clear to me.&#13;
&#13;
           So on the one hand, it was said that this is not&#13;
&#13;
 the final strategy, and strategies are revised after a&#13;
&#13;
 while, and so on.    That is fine.       But at the same time, I&#13;
&#13;
 hope that when we engage resources in the Bank, we engage&#13;
&#13;
 them in functional strategies; so that somehow, we have to&#13;
&#13;
 attribute a certain degree of certainty and certain goals&#13;
&#13;
 to strategies which should be reflected in a certain&#13;
&#13;
 priority which is given inside the Bank, and it is not&#13;
&#13;
 just something that you forget about once it is written,&#13;
&#13;
 and the Board approves it--which I know is not your&#13;
&#13;
 intention, but unfortunately, that is what happens to some&#13;
&#13;
 of the strategies in the Bank right now.&#13;
&#13;
           So we do have a real problem of relating Sector&#13;
&#13;
 Strategies--and there are many of them--to country&#13;
&#13;
 strategies, and it shouldn't just be a free-for-all.         It&#13;
&#13;
 shouldn't be just a menu which, in a country, they say,&#13;
&#13;
 oh, no, we don't want to know anything about social&#13;
&#13;
 protection, or we don't want to know anything about this.&#13;
&#13;
 I think there should be a little bit more of a sense of an&#13;
&#13;
 institution which attributes a certain priority to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               100&#13;
&#13;
 specific goals, which doesn't mean that the countries buy&#13;
&#13;
 into it, but certainly, the Country Directors in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should buy into it in terms of productivity in those&#13;
&#13;
 sectors and in terms of coherence of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 intervention.&#13;
&#13;
           So I think that somehow, that question is--this&#13;
&#13;
 is not the first time this question has come up.        This is&#13;
&#13;
 the question that we face each time.&#13;
&#13;
           So, what to do with it?       On the one side, we&#13;
&#13;
 know that there are policy gaps.       I think the integration&#13;
&#13;
 into a Poverty Reduction Strategy, which we in fact don't&#13;
&#13;
 have because we haven't seen the World Development Report,&#13;
&#13;
 we have not changed the guidelines, we have just an&#13;
&#13;
 emerging process of PRSPs, but we really don't know what&#13;
&#13;
 they are--maybe some do, but I don't.         So that basically,&#13;
&#13;
 it is a strategy which is part of a moving process.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand, I think we are also told--and&#13;
&#13;
 I think it is a very interesting conclusion--that of&#13;
&#13;
 course, we have to revise them, and specific policies then&#13;
&#13;
 have to come out which can be defined better.&#13;
&#13;
           I would say that in a way, you described the&#13;
&#13;
 fact that this is not a one-size-fits-all strategy very&#13;
&#13;
 well when you say that there is an advocacy role in some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               101&#13;
&#13;
 parts of it.   I mean, advocacy inside the Bank is very&#13;
&#13;
 good, although sometimes we would like to see advocacy on&#13;
&#13;
 the outside, because after a while, the advocacy has to&#13;
&#13;
 become policy.   We cannot be a group of people where each&#13;
&#13;
 part of the Bank sees itself as advocating different goals&#13;
&#13;
 in respect to other parts of the Bank, because I think&#13;
&#13;
 that kind of process has to be transformed into decisions&#13;
&#13;
 and not just remain advocacy.&#13;
&#13;
           So in that sense, one of the possibilities I can&#13;
&#13;
 see is that this is being accepted as kind of a--whatever&#13;
&#13;
 it is called--whether it is a strategy or a concept or a&#13;
&#13;
 first strategy for this specific them and sector.       But&#13;
&#13;
 then, there is kind of a follow-up which is now already&#13;
&#13;
 anticipated, and you try to define a sense of direction of&#13;
&#13;
 where this is going in terms, for instance, of attacking&#13;
&#13;
 certain policies in the Bank and providing new policies.&#13;
&#13;
 There are the obvious traditional fields of your activity,&#13;
&#13;
 but there are also the other fields--for instance, the&#13;
&#13;
 question of protection of labor and labor standards and&#13;
&#13;
 many other areas where probably, in time, guidance and&#13;
&#13;
 policies are required.&#13;
&#13;
           So there is the question also of whether a&#13;
&#13;
 regional focus would be important.        So maybe one next step&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                           102&#13;
&#13;
 is to have, let's say, a better-defined or         more&#13;
&#13;
 operational regional focus or focus by certain country&#13;
&#13;
 groups.   Sometimes I'm not sure--and I think I mentioned&#13;
&#13;
 this in the case of education, where the regional focus is&#13;
&#13;
 always the best one.   Maybe we have different categories&#13;
&#13;
 of countries across the Regions which are at different&#13;
&#13;
 stages of importance of the informal sector, of&#13;
&#13;
 traditional society, or of the modern sector, and across&#13;
&#13;
 Regions, they are much more similar in terms of risk&#13;
&#13;
 factors than specific Regions.      That would also be a way&#13;
&#13;
 to go to look much more into this.&#13;
&#13;
           But somehow, I think it will be important to&#13;
&#13;
 give that sense of where the process is going, and in that&#13;
&#13;
 sense, I think we can overcome the question of whether&#13;
&#13;
 this should be more narrow or broader, because basically,&#13;
&#13;
 what we have to define are certain products in the future.&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, I would like to close this&#13;
&#13;
 meeting, but I am not totally sure whether, before this&#13;
&#13;
 goes to the Board, it wouldn't be good to have some kind&#13;
&#13;
 of an informal meeting or seminar--I think there is&#13;
&#13;
 something which is anticipated, right--where maybe this&#13;
&#13;
 kind of purpose or the way this is being looked at in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of other strategies and in terms of future policies&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                               103&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank and also in terms of the precise budget impact&#13;
&#13;
 and what it means in terms of the resources which the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 puts into this effort is being given kind of a focus, and&#13;
&#13;
 in that sense, we get a much better sense of what we are&#13;
&#13;
 going to approve in a Board meeting later on.&#13;
&#13;
           Anna, maybe you have a much better idea.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. BRANDT:   No, not a better idea.      I just&#13;
&#13;
 wanted a bit of specificity when it comes to timing and a&#13;
&#13;
 final Board endorsement of this Strategy Paper, because I&#13;
&#13;
 do think it is a Strategy Paper--we should not dilute&#13;
&#13;
 that--and there are lots of very good things in here.        But&#13;
&#13;
 I think also the messages from the Committee have been&#13;
&#13;
 fairly precise in terms of areas where we would like to&#13;
&#13;
 see some revisions to the document.        And I would disagree&#13;
&#13;
 with Mr. Holzmann that my comments would imply that it has&#13;
&#13;
 to double in length.    I think that was not at all the gist&#13;
&#13;
 of my comments.   But I do think Mr. Jorgensen pointed to a&#13;
&#13;
 few areas where you will try to be more precise and&#13;
&#13;
 specific, and I would want to know what kind of timetable&#13;
&#13;
 we have ahead of us in terms of a revision of the document&#13;
&#13;
 and then a final Board endorsement.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't think we should be talking about a&#13;
&#13;
 budget in relation to SSP; we have not done so in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  104&#13;
&#13;
 past, and I think that leads us into an area which is not&#13;
&#13;
 really the idea or intention of the SSP.           But I would very&#13;
&#13;
 much like to focus on the issue of accountability and the&#13;
&#13;
 fact that this is a document--as we have now heard several&#13;
&#13;
 times during the course of this afternoon's discussion--&#13;
&#13;
 this is a document that Senior Management stands fully&#13;
&#13;
 behind, which also means that Senior Management is&#13;
&#13;
 accountable, not the Sector Board.        I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 emphasize that, and I think that is important when it&#13;
&#13;
 comes to budget implications also, this is something that&#13;
&#13;
 should be implemented in the Regions, so it is not correct&#13;
&#13;
 to say that the resources that are needed must be under&#13;
&#13;
 the Sector Board's envelope.      So I think that is an&#13;
&#13;
 important distinction to make.      But please, if we could&#13;
&#13;
 have some clarifications on the timetable going ahead, I&#13;
&#13;
 think that would be good.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:    Do we have to give those&#13;
&#13;
 clarifications, or does Management have to give those&#13;
&#13;
 clarifications?&#13;
&#13;
           Go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DORYAN:   Probably the idea would be that&#13;
&#13;
 sometime during the month of July, there could be a&#13;
&#13;
 version that incorporates the 10 or 15 points that Steen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             105&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned, and it was a synthesis of the very specific&#13;
&#13;
 concerns plus the synthesis you did in relation to how to&#13;
&#13;
 show the next stages.    And if that would be a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
 document that could go to the Board, it would be great.&#13;
&#13;
           For those who are interested in the work already&#13;
&#13;
 done in the Regions, we could try to do some activity in&#13;
&#13;
 that respect, and that would allow us to move forward and&#13;
&#13;
 see this as a living document, but taking stock of what&#13;
&#13;
 has already happened so far.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't know if that is reasonable for&#13;
&#13;
 everybody.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:    Just to exemplify that, if you take,&#13;
&#13;
 for instance, the indicators, these are obviously&#13;
&#13;
 indicators which are preliminary but in a sense, they are&#13;
&#13;
 indicators which, if they are really approved, they are&#13;
&#13;
 going to have very specific implications in the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 work; otherwise they would not be very valuable.      So if we&#13;
&#13;
 say that the degree of penetration of I don't know what&#13;
&#13;
 has to be so much percent in that Region, that means that&#13;
&#13;
 work has to be done to get there.       I am not totally sure&#13;
&#13;
 at this stage whether anybody has looked into these&#13;
&#13;
 indicators and figured out whether these can be attained&#13;
&#13;
 by the Regions, by the operational departments, or whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                             106&#13;
&#13;
 this is something which we can really look at as something&#13;
&#13;
 operational in two or three years and look back at whether&#13;
&#13;
 they have been achieved or not, or whether they have to be&#13;
&#13;
 discussed in the broader framework.&#13;
&#13;
            Yes?&#13;
&#13;
            MR. JORGENSEN:    The indicators that are here are&#13;
&#13;
 based on our discussions with the Regions and the other&#13;
&#13;
 sectors.   So this is our best guess right now at what is&#13;
&#13;
 going to be implementable.&#13;
&#13;
            I think we are much more confident on the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank column than we are on the country column; obviously,&#13;
&#13;
 that is where a lot of other things will happen.         If we&#13;
&#13;
 have another global financial crisis, things will look&#13;
&#13;
 quite different.   And we stand by them, the Sector Board&#13;
&#13;
 stands by them, and Senior Management has endorsed them in&#13;
&#13;
 the Operations Policy Committee, and each of the regional&#13;
&#13;
 vice presidents and the sectorals have committed to this.&#13;
&#13;
            So this is the Bank's view.        What I said was&#13;
&#13;
 that I would do another re-check just to make sure,&#13;
&#13;
 because things could have changed in the last four months.&#13;
&#13;
 That is the other problem.      Every time months apply,&#13;
&#13;
 things change in the world, and that is why at some point-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                              107&#13;
&#13;
 -I really appreciate Ms. Brandt's comment on trying to get&#13;
&#13;
 some deadlines on when we will do this.&#13;
&#13;
           We could come back with a revised document by&#13;
&#13;
 July, sometime in the month of July, that would try to&#13;
&#13;
 incorporate these things, but there are a couple of areas&#13;
&#13;
 where it really requires a much broader discussion where&#13;
&#13;
 the document would not change.      I want to make that clear.&#13;
&#13;
 We do not propose to change the language on labor&#13;
&#13;
 standards at this point until we get specific directions&#13;
&#13;
 from the Board to change it; but we would do all the other&#13;
&#13;
 things and really try to link it up and try to do the&#13;
&#13;
 country examples and the things I mentioned.        That would&#13;
&#13;
 be doable.&#13;
&#13;
           But this has been endorsed.        This is not taken&#13;
&#13;
 out of the air.   It took a long, very hard process and a&#13;
&#13;
 lot of to-ing and fro-ing on how much these are stretched&#13;
&#13;
 targets--because in a sense, if we meet all the targets,&#13;
&#13;
 we haven't been aggressive enough.        So we hope that we do&#13;
&#13;
 come back to you in a year's time and say we met this but&#13;
&#13;
 not that, because if we met them all, we weren't&#13;
&#13;
 aggressive enough.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]                                  108&#13;
&#13;
             MR. MEYER:   All right.     So we are back in July&#13;
&#13;
 with a revised version, and then for a decision in the&#13;
&#13;
 Board somewhere in August-September.         Is that all right?&#13;
&#13;
             We will have a green sheet which I hope will&#13;
&#13;
 reflect this discussion and give some guidance for the&#13;
&#13;
 revision.&#13;
&#13;
             With that, I think we can close this meeting.         I&#13;
&#13;
 am not sure whether you should come back in the revised&#13;
&#13;
 version with something on labor standards, or whether that&#13;
&#13;
 is already a compromise, or be more specific on this&#13;
&#13;
 something which has to be worked on.         Okay.&#13;
