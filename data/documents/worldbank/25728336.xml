A.    DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
I.    The Trust Fund will support the implementation of the Bank's Trade Strategy&#13;
which was discussed by the Bank's Executive Board of Directors on June 9, 2011 (the the&#13;
"Bank's Trade Strategy"). The Trust Fund will help to finance work programs developed&#13;
by the Bank's regions, networks and other operational units that work on trade. The work&#13;
programs will be designed to respond to client demand for assistance and to pro-actively&#13;
analyze issues anticipating future demand and the provision of public goods (global&#13;
analysis and advocacy), that fall under the four pillars of the Bank's Trade Strategy,&#13;
namely: (i) trade competitiveness and diversification; (ii) trade facilitation, transport&#13;
logistics and trade finance; (iii) support for market access and international trade&#13;
cooperation; and (iv) managing shocks and promoting greater inclusion. The work&#13;
programs will be aligned to country and regional strategies to reflect development&#13;
priorities. Cross-cutting issues of importance to developing countries, including trade&#13;
linkages with gender, environment, regional integration and poverty will also be included&#13;
in the work programs. Specific types of activities to be funded include, inter alia, the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) policy analysis and diagnostics to support country programs;&#13;
(b) technical assistance;&#13;
(c) research;&#13;
(d) capacity building and training at the country level;&#13;

(b) For Recipient-executed activities, the Trust Fund will provide grants that may&#13;

firms, procure goods, negotiate contracts, make payments, submit progress&#13;
reports and audited financial reports to the Bank, all in accordance with the&#13;
terms and conditions contained in a Grant Agreement signed between the Bank&#13;

consultants and workshop participants, etc.);&#13;
(g) media, workshop, conference and meeting expenses (including external&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Governance Structure under the Trust Fund&#13;
The following governance terms will apply to the Trust Fund:&#13;
A.    Bank Aid for Trade Partnership and Coordination Council&#13;
The Trust Fund is established as one of the components of the partnership (the&#13;
"Partnership") convened through the Bank Aid for Trade Coordination Council (the&#13;
"Council"). At its inception, the Partnership consisted of two components, the Multi-Donor&#13;
Trust Fund for the Trade Facilitation Facility (TFO71220) and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
for Trade and Development (TF No. 070745), but was expected to expand to include one&#13;
or more additional trust funds established by the Bank in support of the Partnership (the&#13;
"Partnership Trust Funds").&#13;
The Partnership represents a collaborative effort on the part of the Bank and Donors to&#13;
make the international trading system more supportive of economic development and help&#13;
countries use trade to achieve economic growth and reduce poverty.&#13;
The Council comprises a representative from the Bank and each of the Donors who have&#13;
entered into administration agreements/arrangements with the Bank for Contributions to&#13;
the Partnership Trust Funds, which includes all members of the respective trust fund&#13;
Steering Committees, where applicable. The Council is chaired by the Director of the&#13;
Bank's International Trade Department. The Council may invite representatives of other&#13;
stakeholders, such as the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Assistance&#13;
for Least Developed Countries, regional development banks, the World Customs&#13;
Organization or other international organizations to its meetings to promote greater&#13;
coordination.&#13;
The Council meets annually, as convened by the Bank, in conjunction with Steering&#13;
Committee/Consultative Group meetings of the Partnership Trust Funds. Any decisions are&#13;
made by consensus. The Council has the following roles:&#13;
*  To discuss the strategic directions of the Partnership and the programs supported&#13;
by the Partnership Trust Funds (the "Partnership Programs")&#13;
*  To exchange knowledge, views, ideas and lessons learned about the Partnership&#13;
Programs, as well as members' respective Aid for Trade programs&#13;
*  To discuss broader ways to collaborate on Aid for Trade issues among the Council&#13;
members and with other stakeholders, such as international organizations,&#13;
multilateral development banks, regional economic commissions, private sector&#13;
organizations, and recipient governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 11 -&#13;
The Council does not make decisions regarding the Partnership Trust Funds, which are&#13;
governed in accordance with the terms of their respective administration&#13;
agreements/arrangements with the Bank. The Bank's International Trade Department will&#13;
provide administrative support to the Partnership and Council, including convening&#13;
meetings, preparing minutes and keeping records.&#13;
B.    Trade Council of the Bank's Trade Strategy (as defined in Annex 1)&#13;
The Trade Council of the Bank's Trade Strategy (the "Trade Strategy Council") oversees&#13;
implementation of the Bank's Trade Strategy. The Trade Strategy Council comprises the&#13;
leaders of Bank's regional trade practices/units, operational directors/managers of Bank's&#13;
units that undertake significant trade activities, as well as central units. The Trade Strategy&#13;
Council is chaired by the Director of the Bank's International Trade Department.&#13;
The Trade Strategy Council, as a whole, does not make decisions regarding the Trust Fund.&#13;
However, a sub-committee of the Trade Strategy Council is the main governance body of&#13;
the Trust Fund, as described below.&#13;
C.    Sub-Committee of the Trade Strategy Council&#13;
A sub-committee of the Trade Strategy Council (the "Sub-Committee") acts as the main&#13;
governance body of the Trust Fund. The Sub-Committee is chaired by the Chair of the&#13;
Trade Strategy Council (the Director of the World Bank International Trade Department)&#13;
and is comprised of Bank members of the Trade Strategy Council as determined by the&#13;
Chair by making requests for membership to leaders of Bank units with active trade&#13;
programs. Any decisions are made by consensus.&#13;
The Sub-Committee has the following roles:&#13;
*  To decide on the allocation of resources of the Trust Fund to the Bank's regions,&#13;
networks and other operational units&#13;
*  To review, provide feedback, and approve the work programs of the regions,&#13;
networks and other World Bank operational units receiving funding under the Trust&#13;
Fund, ensuring coordination between the sectors&#13;
*  To receive (from the TTL of the Trust Fund) and review annual reports on the&#13;
outputs and outcomes from the work programs of the Bank's regions, networks and&#13;
other operational units receiving funding under the Trust Fund.&#13;
D.    Consultative Group&#13;
The Consultative Group is established for the purposes of annual progress reporting and&#13;
stocktaking to the donors under the Trust Fund. The Consultative Group comprises&#13;
representative(s) from each donor contributing to the Trust Fund, the Director of the Bank's&#13;
International Trade Department, a senior staff member from DEC and a senior staff&#13;
member(s) from the regions who will represent the rest of the Bank. At the discretion of&#13;
the Director of the Bank's International Trade Department, other donors who may show an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 12 -&#13;
interest in contributing to Trust Fund will be invited to Consultative Group meetings with&#13;
observer status. The Consultative Group is chaired by the Director of the International&#13;
Trade Department.&#13;
The Consultative Group meets annually, as convened by the Bank. It receives (from the&#13;
TTL of the Trust Fund) the work programs (including indicative budgets) of the regions,&#13;
networks and other Bank operational units receiving funding from the Trust Fund, as well&#13;
as annual reports on the outputs and outcomes. Members of the Consultative Group will&#13;
be given an opportunity to comment on these documents, with the understanding that&#13;
decisions on work programs and allocation of resources will be made by the Sub-&#13;
Committee, as noted in Section C above.&#13;
E.    Program Management&#13;
The Trust Fund will rely on the existing management structure of the Bank. The Bank's&#13;
International Trade Department will be the managing unit and its Sector Manager will&#13;
appoint the task team leader ("TTL") to administer the trust fund and to ensure that the&#13;
following roles are carried out within the managing unit:&#13;
*  Providing administrative services for the Sub-Committee and Consultative Group,&#13;
including convening meetings, preparing minutes, keeping records, and&#13;
administering the allocation of resources as approved by the Sub-Committee&#13;
*  Monitoring all activities of the Trust Fund, including commitments and&#13;
disbursements&#13;
*  Compiling  annual work   programs (including  indicative  budgets) and&#13;
output/outcome reports from the regions, networks and other Bank operational&#13;
units and submitting them to the Sub-Committee for approval and to Consultative&#13;
Group for information and comments (for consideration by the Sub-Committee)&#13;
*  Serving as focal point for communications with members of the Sub-Committee&#13;
and the Consultative Group&#13;
*  Coordinating the process of bringing new donors into the trust fund.&#13;
