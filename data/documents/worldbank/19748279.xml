       Africa Social Safety Net and Social Protection Assessment Series&#13;
&#13;
Until recently, most countries in Africa implemented safety nets and social protection programs only on an&#13;
ad hoc basis. In the wake of the global economic, food and fuel price crises starting in 2008, however,&#13;
policymakers in Africa began to increasingly view safety nets as core instruments for reducing poverty,&#13;
addressing inequality, and helping poor and vulnerable households to manage risk more effectively.&#13;
During FY2009-2013, to support governments in their quest to understand better how to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of safety nets in their countries, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Africa Region undertook&#13;
social safety net or social protection assessments in a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2014&#13;
assessments have been completed or are under preparation for over 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
These assessments analyze the status of social protection programs and safety nets, their strengths and&#13;
weaknesses and identify areas for improvement, all with the aim of helping governments and donors to&#13;
strengthen African safety net systems and social protection programs to protect and promote poor and&#13;
vulnerable people. They were all carried-out with the explicit aim of informing governmentsâ&#128;&#153; social&#13;
protection policies and programs. With the results of analytical work like these assessments and other&#13;
types of support, safety nets and social protection programs are rapidly changing across Africa. For a&#13;
cross-country regional review, please see "Reducing Poverty and Investing in People: The New Role of&#13;
Safety Nets in Africa," which pulls together the findings and lessons learned from these assessments and&#13;
other recent studies of safety net programs in Africa.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Abstract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This assessment shows that Mozambique social protection system is developing. While&#13;
programs to address most of the risks identified exist, there are still major gaps. Poor&#13;
families with children are not adequately supported, there is no significant youth program,&#13;
and subsistence farmers and other workers are not properly protected against recurrent&#13;
shocks. The government spends a considerable amount of its resources on social protection&#13;
but most are absorbed by untargeted subsidies and pensions that benefit only a few. This&#13;
assessment suggests that it will be necessary to address three mutually complimentary&#13;
issues: developing effective mechanisms to maximize the impact of social protection on&#13;
reducing poverty; rationalizing public expenditures while filling existing program gaps; and&#13;
strengthening institutional arrangements. In order to address the multiple challenges&#13;
Mozambique faces to support particularly vulnerable groups and reduce extreme poverty&#13;
and food insecurity, the report proposes a gradual approach framed in the existing social&#13;
protection strategy approved by the Government in 2010.&#13;

This study was prepared by JosÃ© SilvÃ©rio Marques (World Bank Consultant), under the&#13;
guidance of Manuel Salazar (Task Manager, Lead Social Protection Specialist, World Bank).&#13;
The initial findings of the assessment were presented and discussed at a stakeholder&#13;
workshop organized by the MMAS and INAS in Namaacha, on May 11 and 12, 2011. An&#13;
early version of the report was shared and discussed in Maputo with Government officials&#13;
and Development Partners on September 28 and 29, 2011 respectively. The final version of&#13;
the report was presented and discussed during the International Conference â&#128;&#156;Social&#13;
Protection Weekâ&#128;&#157;, held in Maputo, Mozambique in June 2012. The assessment counted&#13;
with the support of Vasco Molini (World Bank, Poverty Economist). Ana Lukau (Program&#13;
Assistant, AFTSP) has helped with the formatting of the report. The team would like to&#13;
thank for the support received from Government officials working on social protection&#13;
programs, development partners that are supporting the strengthening of the Social&#13;
Protection System, and other stakeholders that participated in the workshops where the&#13;
report was discussed. The team would also like to thank the ILO and UNICEF for providing&#13;
valuable information and commenting on different stages of the report. The team would&#13;
like to thank in particular for the support received from the Honorable Iolanda Cintura,&#13;
Minister of MMAS, and Lucia Bernardete Mairosse, Executive Director of INAS and their&#13;
staffs.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
I.     Context, Purpose, and Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s economy grew by about 7.5 percent per year between 1992 and&#13;
2009. Poverty fell from over 70 percent to about 60 percent between 1996 and 2003.&#13;
However, progress in reducing poverty over the last few years has substantially lower&#13;
because growth was less inclusive with no visible gains in production and productivity in&#13;
labor-intensive sectors particularly in subsistence agriculture. Poverty incidence is still&#13;
affecting more than half of the Mozambican population is still poor. With a population of&#13;
22.9 million and per capita income of only US$471, Mozambique remains one the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
poorest countries. Food represents more than two-thirds of the average consumption of&#13;
poor households. It is estimated that about 20 percent of the population is food-insecure,&#13;
and almost half of children under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished. Extremely poor&#13;
and vulnerable households are highly exposed both to seasonal shocks (like the annual dry&#13;
season) and to frequent but unpredictable non-seasonal shocks (like cyclones, floods, or&#13;
significant variations in fuel or food prices). The recent economic slowdown may have&#13;
reversed some of the earlier gains in poverty reduction and has negatively affected&#13;
household consumption. This is a clear indication that Mozambique needs an effective&#13;
social protection system (SPS) to protect and promote the most vulnerable from the&#13;
negative effects of shocks and to foster their inclusion in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic and social&#13;
development process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.     Early in 2010, the government approved the National Basic Social Security Strategy&#13;
(SeguranÃ§a Social BÃ¡sica or ENSSB) covering the period 2010 to 2014. The ENSSB aims to&#13;
extend social protection coverage with the objective of including poor and vulnerable&#13;
populations in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s development process. The ENSSB has four parts:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               vii&#13;
&amp;#12;       (i) Direct Social Action, in which the government has made further efforts to&#13;
organize social assistance interventions. These are mainly transfer programs for the poor&#13;
and vulnerable who are unable to work, as well as short-term, in-kind transfers provided in&#13;
response to temporary vulnerabilities and other social welfare services. The Ministry of&#13;
Women and Social Action (MMAS) and the National Institute of Social Action (INAS) are&#13;
responsible for the interventions in this category including the main unconditional cash&#13;
transfer program, the Food Subsidy Program (Programa Subsidio de Alimentos or PSA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (ii) Education Social Action, managed by the Ministry of Education. This includes&#13;
social protection programs such as school feeding that aim to facilitate access to basic&#13;
education, thus increasing enrollment and attendance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (iii) Health Social Action, overseen by the Ministry of Health. This includes measures&#13;
and programs to promote access to basic health care for vulnerable groups (such as people&#13;
with HIV) as well as nutrition interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (iv) Productive Social Action, a cross-sectoral approach that aims to increase access&#13;
to income-generating opportunities for the poor and vulnerable who are able to work&#13;
through employment and livelihood interventions, including public works and social funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.     Even though the ENSSB provides a framework for the future development of&#13;
comprehensive safety net interventions, most of its operational aspects are still being&#13;
defined, especially those in the Direct Action and Productive Social Action areas. Several&#13;
studies or evaluations have been done of specific programs or target groups, but there is&#13;
still no comprehensive analysis of the social protection landscape in Mozambique with a&#13;
vision of an effective social protection system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     The objective of this study is to assist the Government of Mozambique in the&#13;
consolidation and implementation of the ENSSB by reviewing of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s social safety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                viii&#13;
&amp;#12;net programs and social protection expenditures and by seeking to answer the following&#13;
questions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        a. How adequate is the social protection system to meet the needs of the various&#13;
             groups that require assistance?&#13;
        b. How cost-effective are the social protection programs?&#13;
        c. How responsive is the social protection system in addressing emerging&#13;
             vulnerabilities?&#13;
        d. Is the range of existing programs appropriate for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s needs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.     To meet its objectives, the study uses the so-called lifecycle (or life-course) analysis&#13;
and is organized as follows. After a brief discussion in Chapter I of the main risks facing&#13;
families in Mozambique and of the conceptual framework underpinning this assessment,&#13;
Chapter II identifies the main vulnerable groups, discusses the principal risks that these&#13;
groups and households in general face, and estimates the number of individuals or&#13;
households who are at risk. Chapter III reviews the principal programs that are in place to&#13;
address these risks. Chapter IV assesses the adequacy of the social protection system by&#13;
analyzing the following: (i) spending and budget arrangements; (ii) program coverage, gaps,&#13;
and overlaps; (iii) the generosity of benefits; (iv) targeting and selection mechanisms; (v)&#13;
cost-effectiveness; (vi) institutional and coordination arrangements; (vii) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; and (viii) sustainability. Chapter V presents the conclusion and&#13;
recommendations. Annex I presents the questionnaire that we used to collect information&#13;
on the social assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.    Risks, Groups at Risk and Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.     The poor (or the near poor) is usually the most vulnerable group in a society because&#13;
it does not have the assets (human and physical) to respond to adverse shocks, and&#13;
therefore after a shock has a high probability of becoming poorer (or poor). The IOF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               ix&#13;
&amp;#12;2008/09 indicates that in Mozambique not only over one-half of the population remains&#13;
poor, but also that a large share is near the poverty line. Over 60 percent of all&#13;
Mozambicans are below the poverty line plus 10 percent, and two-thirds are below the&#13;
poverty line plus 25 percent; in the Northern Region nearly 80 percent are below the&#13;
poverty line plus 25 percent. This makes these Mozambicans very vulnerable to small&#13;
variations in income, either seasonal or annual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.      Mozambique is highly vulnerable to shocks either recurrent natural disasters,&#13;
particularly droughts, floods, and cyclones or predictable seasonal shocks (lean season) 1.&#13;
According to a 2007 FAO assessment, 20 of the 128 districts in the country are â&#128;&#156;highly prone&#13;
to droughtâ&#128;&#157;, 30 to flooding, and 7 to both. Poor and nearly poor households are also&#13;
exposed to annual seasonal shocks and a significant proportion of households, especially&#13;
those in rural areas, are exposed to food insecurity.2 This pattern is particularly marked in&#13;
rural areas of the four provinces in central Mozambique. It is estimated that about 40&#13;
percent more calories are consumed in good months compared with the lean season 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.      Conditions of poor households differ in urban and rural areas. On average close to&#13;
80 percent of primary income in the country comes from agricultural activities, which is&#13;
highly seasonal and susceptible to climatic shocks. However, while about 90 percent of&#13;
employment in rural areas consist of farmers and a minor proportion of agricultural wage,&#13;
about two thirds of urban residents obtain their primary income from non-agricultural&#13;
activities. This results in the urban poor being more exposed to economic shocks,&#13;
unemployment and low income instead of seasonal or climatic shocks. Indeed, food prices&#13;
and the financial crises were the main shocks in urban areas in 2008/09 affecting more than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  In the last twenty years, Mozambique experienced 8 major droughts, 16 major floods, 2 costal floods/storm&#13;
surges, and 9 tropical cyclones, causing loss of live and severe economic damage. "EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED&#13;

&amp;#12;50 percent of urban residents and exacerbating food insecurity4. While rural households&#13;
were also affected by food prices (at a lower rate), these households are regularly exposed&#13;
to seasonal shocks as well as frequent climate-related shocks (droughts, floods, etc.) which&#13;
also increase their food insecurity5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.    Assessment of the Social Protection System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Government of Mozambique has taken important steps in the last few years to&#13;
put in place a framework to strengthen the SPS. This legal and policy framework is very&#13;
much aligned with the current international best practice. Indeed, the new World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Social Protection Strategy for 2012-22 under discussion calls for building social protection&#13;
systems, not only a collection of social assistance and insurance programs, which should&#13;
provide three basic functions: prevention, protection and promotion. Prevention&#13;
corresponds to the GOMâ&#128;&#153;s Compulsory and Complementary Social Security; Protection to&#13;
Direct, Education, and Health Social Action; and Promotion to Productive Social Action. The&#13;
complexity of building social protection systems should not be underestimated. It entails&#13;
many different actors and preferences, programs, policies, instruments, institutions,&#13;
financing, and often difficult trade-offs. The pace of construction of social protection&#13;
systems must therefore be adequate to each countryâ&#128;&#153;s institutional and finan cial conditions&#13;
and capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.     Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system is a â&#128;&#156;work in progressâ&#128;&#157;. From the&#13;
assessment made, it can be concluded that there are still important program gaps,&#13;
particularly programs for poor families with children, for youth at risk, and to help seasonal&#13;
agricultural workers and the urban unemployed; many programs have low coverage and&#13;
generosity; there is program fragmentation (i.e., various pension plans) and duplication&#13;

&amp;#12;(assistance programs); MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pensions and fuel subsidies absorb a large share of social&#13;
protection expenditures and do not benefit the poor; and there is substantial room to&#13;
improve targeting and beneficiary selection mechanisms and increase program cost-&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.    Estimates of spending according to the GOMâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection Framework in dicate&#13;
that about 44 percent is spent on Basic Social Security and 56 percent on Compulsory Social&#13;
Security (excluding subsidies). Within Basic Social Security, Direct Social Action programs&#13;
absorb 35.6 percent of spending; Education Social Action, 43.9 percent; Health Social&#13;
Action, 13.1 percent; and Productive Social Action, 7.4 percent. External resources finances&#13;
two-thirds of Basic Social Security. External resources finance one-third of Direct Social&#13;
Action; two-thirds of Education Social Action; 90 percent of Health Social Action; and 69&#13;
percent of Productive Social Action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.    The major social assistance programs in Mozambique have low coverage relative to&#13;
the number of individuals at risk, including the unconditional cash transfers (PSA) and the&#13;
other INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs, school lunches, HIV/AIDS programs, and food for work. INSS has low&#13;
coverage as it covers less than 5 percent of the labor force and 88 percent of elderly have&#13;
no pension. Out of the 37 programs for which some information has been obtained, 5&#13;
programs have been identified with high coverage, 1 with fair coverage, and 31 with low&#13;
coverage. MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pension plans cover all public employees and therefore are classified as&#13;
having high coverage, though public employees and their dependents represent less than 3&#13;
percent of the population. The other programs with high coverage are the micronutrients&#13;
programs which according to MOHâ&#128;&#153;s Surveillance Program cover all the â&#128;&#156;intendedâ&#128;&#157; target&#13;
group though many children continue to suffer from malnutrition (44 percent of the under&#13;
five are stunt). The program classified with fair coverage is adult education, as it covers 1.1&#13;
million adults of the estimated 5.9 million illiterate adults in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xii&#13;
&amp;#12;13.    The expenditure data and the program coverage data indicates that major program&#13;
gaps include those for poor families with children, programs for youth, and programs for&#13;
the working poor, particularly those facing recurrent weather related shocks. On the other&#13;
hand, there is fragmentation and duplication of social assistance programs and poor&#13;
program coordination which rests effectiveness to social protection spending. For instance,&#13;
there is fragmentation of youth and training programs and there are three major pension&#13;
plans operated by MOF and INSS. Moreover, INAS has been implementing microcredit and&#13;
training programs, and building schools and health posts while other institutions in the&#13;
government are specialized in these areas. There is lack of coordination between INAS and&#13;
the institutions in charge of education, health, youth, training, and microenterprise&#13;
programs. There is also lack of coordination between public entities and NGOs and other&#13;
civil society organizations which leads to duplication of efforts. Some analysts have&#13;
indicated that there is significant level of program fragmentation and duplication and un-&#13;
coordinated activities on the part of NGOs working in the social sectors. For instance in the&#13;
health sector, there is a number of international organizations, donors, and NGOs active in&#13;
the sector (PEPFAR, Clinton Foundation, Save the Children, Bill Gates Foundation, etc.) that&#13;
use their own implementation mechanisms and financing channels other than the state&#13;
budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.    Most assistance programs are not generous. PSA generosity (defined as the amount&#13;
of transfer divided by Q1 household food expenditure) is below the median for a sample of&#13;
countries with similar transfer programs. PSA transfers only cover a small share (24 percent)&#13;
of the food requirements of the poorest families. Likewise, the minimum INSS pension only&#13;
cover the basic food needs of the poorest family but no other essential goods and services.&#13;
Even the families of those receiving the average INSS pension might be below the poverty&#13;
line if the pension is their only source of income. MOF pensions are more generous as its&#13;
retirees can afford expenditures of better off (Q4) households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;15.    The targeting accuracy of major social assistance programs is quite poor, though two&#13;
caveats are in order. First, the distribution of poverty across quintiles is quite flat, therefore&#13;
reaching the poorest of the poor is a greater targeting challenge in Mozambique than in&#13;
countries where this group is more easily identified; secondly, the large share of population&#13;
involved in informal sector and subsistence farming activities makes it also more challenging&#13;
to target on the basis of income or consumption measures compared to countries with&#13;
larger formal sectors and monetized economies. With these caveats in mind, the targeting&#13;
accuracy of the two programs that are designed to reach the poor and for which there is&#13;
information on targeting results (PSA and PASD) is quite low. Therefore INAS should&#13;
improve its beneficiary selection mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16.    Program fragmentation and duplication and lack of coordination of interventions&#13;
rest cost-effectiveness to the social protection system. On the other hand, INASâ&#128;&#153;s major&#13;
programs (PSA, PGR, PBST) have high administrative costs and some program (PBST, PGR)&#13;
have little lasting poverty impact. Poor targeting also contribute to low cost-effectiveness as&#13;
the benefits end up in the hands of some better off while some of the neediest are excluded&#13;
from the programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.    MMAS and INAS are in need of substantial institutional strengthening, particularly&#13;
now that heavy demands are being placed on them for the development and&#13;
implementation of the National Strategy of Basic Social Security (ENSSB). Coordination of&#13;
interventions also remains a challenge. There is still is a lack of coordination across sectors,&#13;
with most programs unable to exploit the synergy that could be generated from closer&#13;
coordination in program design and implementation. At local level, challenges remain to&#13;
coordinate the actions on the ground because of the lack of clear definition of roles of the&#13;
different actors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.    Despite progress made in recent years in developing monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) systems in Mozambique, weaknesses remain as a consequence of an abundance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xiv&#13;
&amp;#12;processes and methodologies. At the central level, three distinct systems exist for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the Economic and Social Plan (PES), PARPA and the Sector&#13;
Strategic Plans. The system to monitor the execution of the PES (known as balance do PES)&#13;
is the most entrenched at all level of government and indeed it has been a major source of&#13;
information for this study. These national systems are in turn supported by a multitude of&#13;
sectoral and provincial systems that have not benefited from a consistent methodology or&#13;
standardization. The development of a culture of management by results and monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of policies and programs is a process that requires continued commitment&#13;
and effort from the GOM authorities and investment in information systems and staff&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.    Mozambique is a poor country and it will continue to require foreign support for&#13;
many years to come. As discussed, external resources finances about two-thirds of Basic&#13;
Social Security. This heavy dependence on external resources raises issues of program&#13;
sustainability over the longer term and calls for using existing resources in the more&#13;
efficient and effective possible way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.    Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.    The Government of Mozambique has taken important steps in the last few years to&#13;
put in place a framework to strengthen the social protection system. This legal and policy&#13;
framework is very much in keeping with the current international best practice. Indeed, the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s forthcoming Social Protection Strategy for 2012-22 calls for building social&#13;
protection systems rather than just a collection of social assistance and insurance programs.&#13;
It also specifies that these systems should provide three basic functions: prevention,&#13;
protection and promotion. Prevention corresponds to the GOMâ&#128;&#153;s Compulsory and&#13;
Complementary Social Security; Protection to Direct, Education, and Health Social Action;&#13;
and Promotion to Productive Social Action. The complexity of building social protection&#13;
systems should not be underestimated. It entails many different actors, preferences,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xv&#13;
&amp;#12;programs, policies, instruments, institutions, and financing and often requires policymakers&#13;
to make difficult trade-offs. Therefore, the pace at which a social protection system can be&#13;
built must depend on the specific institutional and financial conditions and capabilities of&#13;
the country in question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.    Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system is â&#128;&#156;work in progressâ&#128;&#157;. From the assessment&#13;
made it can be concluded that the Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s SPS: (i) is not very adequate to meet the&#13;
needs of the population as there are many small, fragmented programs and a small number&#13;
of people receive significant benefits and the majority little or nothing; (ii) is not cost-&#13;
effective as the major assistance programs are poorly targeted and have high administrative&#13;
costs; (iii) is not responsive to emerging vulnerabilities as most programs have low&#13;
coverage and generosity; and (iv) does not have the adequate range of programs to meet&#13;
the needs of different groups since there are still important program gaps, particularly&#13;
programs for poor families with children, for youth at risk, and to help seasonal agricultural&#13;
workers and the urban unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.    In Mozambique, following the Namaachaâ&#128;&#153;s workshop in May 2011, the MMAS and&#13;
INAS have developed a proposal to restructure their programs. The proposal establishes&#13;
four areas of intervention: (i) monetary transfers for an unlimited time that will comprise a&#13;
Program of Basic Social Subsidies (Programa de Subsidio Social BÃ¡sico) based on an&#13;
expanded PSA; (ii) monetary transfers for limited time that will include the Program de&#13;
Apoio Social Directo (PASD) divided into an ad hoc component and a long-term support&#13;
component; (iii) social assistance services for vulnerable and abandoned children, elderly&#13;
people, victims of violence, and the homeless that will include a Program of Institutional&#13;
Attention (public nurseries/kindergartens and support centers for the elderly, the&#13;
handicapped, and repatriate) and a Program of Family Orientation and Reunification; and&#13;
(iv) productive social action in the form of a labor-intensive public works program and a&#13;
component of support to the Development of Income Generation Activities Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                xvi&#13;
&amp;#12;23.    The MMAS/INAS proposal, which was recently approved by the Cabinet, is an&#13;
important step towards developing a vision of an integrated social protection system in&#13;
Mozambique that: (i) responds effectively and flexibly not only to existing risks but also to&#13;
shocks; (ii) exploits synergies between programs and is based on shared operational&#13;
platforms to increase programsâ&#128;&#153; impact and cost-effectiveness; and (iii) includes a unified&#13;
social insurance program, rationalized social assistance programs, effective labor market&#13;
programs, and closer links between programs and social and productive services. The&#13;
discussion in this study suggests that it will be necessary to address three mutually&#13;
complimentary issues in order to achieve this vision: developing effective mechanisms and&#13;
processes to maximize the impact of SP interventions in terms of reducing poverty;&#13;
rationalizing public expenditures while filling existing program gaps; and strengthening&#13;
institutional arrangements. It is also important to keep in mind that the most important&#13;
strategy for reducing the vulnerability and poverty of Mozambican families, which is the&#13;
major objective of the social protection system, is to continue to pursue growth-oriented,&#13;
job-creating, pro-poor policies. Having a stable job that pays a reasonable wage is the main&#13;
way for individuals and their households to rise out of or avoid falling into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.    Given its capacity and resources limitations, the GOM should address these issues in&#13;
three stages. In the first stage, the GOM could focus on: (i) consolidating the basic social&#13;
assistance system by restructuring the PSA (into a new Basic Social Subsidy Program),&#13;
implementing a labor-intensive public works program that will help the poor to survive&#13;
during the lean season and will fill part of the programmatic gap, and strengthening the&#13;
traditional social services; (ii) improving processes and mechanisms (by creating a new&#13;
operational platform) to increase the cost-effectiveness of interventions; and (iii) deepening&#13;
the social security reforms. In the second stage, the GOM should consider introducing an&#13;
unconditional transfer program for poor families with children (particularly for labor-poor&#13;
families) to fill the other part of the programmatic gap. This program and the PSA transfer&#13;
program would both be based on the new operational platform and would be linked with&#13;
education, health, and other related services and with public works, training programs, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xvii&#13;
&amp;#12;other income-generation activities. The third stage would focus on evaluating the new&#13;
programs, tightening the links between programs and services, and strengthening&#13;
coordination mechanisms with NGOs. Reducing program fragmentation and duplication&#13;
should be a goal during all three stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.      First Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.     During this first stage the focus should be on consolidating the basic social assistance&#13;
system and implementing a labor-intensive public works program that will help the poor to&#13;
survive during the lean season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.      Consolidating the Basic Social Assistance System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     Consolidating the basic social assistance system should be done gradually. The focus&#13;
of social action activities should be a combination of the Basic Social Subsidy Program and&#13;
the Productive Social Action Program. The former would be a reformed and enhanced PSA,&#13;
while the latter would consist of a labor-intensive public works program. It is expected that&#13;
these two programs will account for over 80 percent of the social assistance budget during&#13;
the first few years of this stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.     A strategic combination of public works programs and cash transfers would provide&#13;
vulnerable groups with access to productive, income-generating activities and to social&#13;
services. The public works would provide vulnerable groups with seasonal work and a&#13;
predictable source of income, thus helping them to smooth their consumption and avoid&#13;
the need to make negative investment decisions (such as selling off their assets or eating&#13;
less food) while also improving their wellbeing. In the medium term, participation in public&#13;
works program is expected to help vulnerable households to accumulate assets, thus&#13;
making it more feasible for them to adopt more productive income-generating activities.&#13;
The reformed PSA would continue to be a permanent intervention implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             xviii&#13;
&amp;#12;throughout the year, albeit with some adjustments to its targeting mechanisms and to the&#13;
controls over the disbursement of funds. Gradually, it may be possible to make both&#13;
interventions linked on the use by beneficiary households of education, health, and&#13;
nutrition services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.    Consolidating the basic social assistance system would involve adjusting and&#13;
consolidating the PSA, scaling up the labor-intensive public works program, and&#13;
strengthening social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a.     Basic Social Subsidy Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.    The Basic Social Benefit, which will build on the existing Food Subsidy Program, will&#13;
have a greater focus on children as the indirect beneficiaries (as dependents) of this&#13;
transfer. Only those households that include no able-bodied people of working age and&#13;
have no other source of support (such as pensions) will be eligible. The level of the transfer&#13;
will be reviewed to ensure effectiveness of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.    The transfer, which will be allocated by household, will consist of a baseline amount&#13;
plus 25 percent for each dependent up to a maximum of four dependents. This formula is&#13;
used to ensure that the minimum needs of each individual are met, using as proxy&#13;
estimates of the IOF, in its approach to poverty lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
b.     Implementing a Labor-intensive Public Works Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.    INASâ&#128;&#153;s Public Works Program with Intensive Use of Manpower, which is being&#13;
developed by the GOM with the support of the World Bank, is one of the main interventions&#13;
of the Productive Social Action pillar of the Basic Social Assistance Strategy. This is expected&#13;
to be supplemented by other programs related to income generation in the second stage of&#13;
the reform. Its target population is the chronically food-insecure whose situation is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xix&#13;
&amp;#12;aggravated periodically by droughts and floods as well as the able-bodied unemployed. The&#13;
objective is to stabilize income and to reduce vulnerability to future shocks by providing&#13;
monetary transfers in exchange for temporary work. The program will be implemented&#13;
during the dry season or during other times when rural workers cannot find work in&#13;
agriculture and when food insecurity is higher. In urban areas, this seasonal aspect of food&#13;
security does not exist, but certain types of work need to be performed at certain times of&#13;
the year (for example, drainage ditches need to be cleaned around February/March).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c.      Strengthening Social Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32.     It is important to keep in mind that, when new social assistance programs are&#13;
implemented, there is a danger of crowding out resources for the traditional social services,&#13;
which serve abandoned children, orphans, foster children and other children in the care of&#13;
the state, the disabled, the homeless, and the indigent elderly. These programs are the&#13;
foundation of social protection and should always be given a high priority by the&#13;
government. In Mozambique these programs include the social services provided by the&#13;
MMAS, residential care for needy children, the elderly, and the disabled provided by INASâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Unidades Sociais, and the (ad hoc) emergency assistance by INASâ&#128;&#153;s Direct Social Assistance&#13;
Program. The GOM is also responsible for regulating the provision of these services by the&#13;
private sector, NGOs, and faith-based organizations. Therefore, these programs and&#13;
services should be adequately resourced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.   Establishing a New Operational Platform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33.     The ILO and INAS have signed an agreement recently to develop and implement a&#13;
new management information system (MIS). This will create a unified central beneficiary&#13;
database (registry) and will help to improve the management of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs. This is a&#13;
very important development. The MIS will be based in Maputo, with access to all of the 30&#13;
INAS delegations, and will benefit from the most recent IT, communication, and safety and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xx&#13;
&amp;#12;safeguard technologies. The applications will be web based. The system will cover five&#13;
processes: system management; beneficiary management; subsidies payment&#13;
management; subsidies finance management; and statistical reports management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34.    The reformed PSA will use this new platform. In addition, INAS should review its&#13;
targeting and beneficiary selection mechanisms, payment mechanisms, grievance and&#13;
appeal processes, program recertification and exit rules, and program monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems as discussed in detail in Chapter V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.   Reforming Social Security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.    Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s pension system has several significant shortcomings including&#13;
fragmentation, the low coverage and modest benefits of the INSS, and increasing public&#13;
expenditure on the MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pensions. The GOM has begun to reform the social security&#13;
system with the support of the World Bank and ILO with the aim of slowly reducing&#13;
fragmentation and merging the existing plans over the longer term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36.    The World Bank is helping to reform the MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pension plans, including by&#13;
conducting functional and actuarial studies. ILO is supporting the reform of the INSS to&#13;
ensure its long-term financial viability. So far the INSS has revised its investment portfolio&#13;
and is developing an investment strategy. It is improving the way in which it registers its&#13;
contributors and is strengthening collection methods. It is also conducting an actuarial study&#13;
based on the audited accounts of 2004-08, and it plans to reform its organizational&#13;
structure and introduce a modern management information system (MIS). In addition, the&#13;
INSS should aim to increase its coverage of the labor force. The priority should be to ensure&#13;
that all private sector firms contribute to the system and delinquency rates are reduced.&#13;
Next it should seek to cover the self-employed, initially by concentrating on the easier-to-&#13;
reach organized professional groups such as lawyers or engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxi&#13;
&amp;#12;B.     Second Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37.    In this stage, the authorities should focus on complementing the revamped PSA&#13;
transfer program for the elderly poor and others unable to work (social pension) with a&#13;
transfer program for poor families with children, both based on the new operational&#13;
platform. They should also link these transfer programs with education, health, and other&#13;
social services and link labor-intensive public works programs with training, credit,&#13;
insurance, and other financial services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.     Social Pensions and Transfers to Families with Children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38.    The MMAS and INAS propose dividing the PASD into two interventions: a short-&#13;
term, ad hoc transfer for families and a long-term transfer (Apoio Prolongado) for specific&#13;
groups such as families with children with nutritional deficiencies, child-headed households,&#13;
the chronically ill (bed-ridden) and women heads of household who are temporarily unable&#13;
to work. However, we recommend that this long-term component should be included as&#13;
part of a new transfer using the PSA operational platform. Specifically, we recommend that&#13;
the GOM consider developing two unconditional cash transfers based on the common PSA&#13;
operational platform (see the first stage) and filling the other programmatic gap as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·       Social Pension (PensÃ£o Social) for the elderly poor who have no children in&#13;
their household, the disabled, and the chronically ill who are unable to work and have no&#13;
pensions or other source of income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·       Support to Children (Apoio as CrianÃ§as) for poor families (particularly labor-&#13;
poor families) with children aged 0 to 17 years and child-headed households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             xxii&#13;
&amp;#12;39.    Target Groups. The first target group is already being covered by PSA. The number&#13;
of the elderly as well as other potential beneficiaries (people with chronic diseases, unable&#13;
to work, and living without children) would need to be determined. The second target&#13;
group is poor families with children (particularly labor-poor families such as those with a&#13;
single earner, a high dependency ratio, or partial or temporary incapacities) or child-headed&#13;
households. The aim of targeting these groups would be to break the inter-generational&#13;
transmission of poverty by increasing poor familiesâ&#128;&#153; access to food, health, education, and&#13;
other services. OVC should be included in this group rather than being treated as a separate&#13;
group, and priority should be given to households headed by children. The elderly who live&#13;
with children should also be included in this group as well as poor pregnant women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.    Benefit Level. The benefit of the program should be consistent with its objectives.&#13;
The Social Pension should provide an amount sufficient to buy a meaningful share of the&#13;
beneficiaryâ&#128;&#153;s food needs. The transfer to poor families with children should provide&#13;
additional resources to improve the childrenâ&#128;&#153;s nutritional status, health, and educational&#13;
attainment. Two concerns are at play here. One is whether the transfer undermines existing&#13;
informal coping arrangements instead of complementing them. The other concern is what&#13;
some authors have called â&#128;&#156;leap-froggingâ&#128;&#157; when the transfer makes beneficiary families&#13;
richer than their neighbors, thus creating tension within the community. This could be a real&#13;
problem in many communities given that, as discussed, the distribution of consumption is&#13;
quite flat in Mozambique. This problem can be minimized by keeping the transfer as low as&#13;
consistent with achieving its objective and providing other benefits in kind (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.    The Social Pension should cover a significant share of the cost of the actualized Q1&#13;
food basket and should be periodically actualized. The transfer to families with children&#13;
should include this base amount plus an additional amount for each child up to a given limit&#13;
on the number of children to take into account economies of scale and avoid unwanted&#13;
incentives, like those that exist in the current PSA system. It is important to stress that the&#13;
difference between what is being suggested and the existing PSA is that the reformed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxiii&#13;
&amp;#12;version would clearly identify the target groups (families with children and people in need&#13;
of a social pension), would focus on families with children, and would ensure that&#13;
complementary services are made available to break the inter-generational transmission of&#13;
poverty by leveraging transfers and investment in human capital (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.    Establishing Links between Transfers and Other Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42.    The Social Pension and the Support to Children transfer programs should establish&#13;
close links with education, health, and other services (e.g., birth registry). Indeed, under&#13;
Decree 85/09 (Articles 11-14) which regulates the Basic Social Security Subsystem it is&#13;
already contemplated that poor people should have free access to several services. The&#13;
Decree declares that health services must be provided free to pregnant women, children&#13;
under the age of 5, the elderly, the disabled, and people with chronic diseases or suffering&#13;
from HIV/AIDS, leprosy, or tuberculosis. On education, it reiterates that primary education&#13;
is free to all children (who also have access to free textbooks) and that children in need&#13;
should have access to school lunches and get support for educational materials. In Article 2,&#13;
the Regulation states that this provision will materialize â&#128;&#156;gradually, taking into account the&#13;
economic conditions of the country.â&#128;&#157; To ensure that there are synergies between all social&#13;
programs and services in Mozambique, the beneficiaries of the Social Pension and the&#13;
Support to Children programs should be automatically eligible for free health services (and&#13;
medicine) and for free primary schooling, textbooks, uniforms, school materials, and (when&#13;
available) school lunches as well as for free birth registration when required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
43.    Given existing institutional limitations and resource constraints, these efforts to&#13;
strengthen the links between the unconditional transfer programs and education, health,&#13;
and other services should be made initially in a selected number of districts or communities&#13;
where significant improvements can be made in the existing health and education services&#13;
that can gradually be extended to the rest of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxiv&#13;
&amp;#12;44.    Communication is very important for achieving the objectives of the Support for&#13;
Children unconditional cash transfer. Each community should be fully briefed on the&#13;
purpose of the program. Communities should help ensure that the families that are selected&#13;
as beneficiaries are those that are most in need and that families headed by children, OVC,&#13;
children with nutritional problems, and poor pregnant women are included. Furthermore,&#13;
the beneficiary families must be made aware of what is expected of them â&#128;&#147; that the diet of&#13;
the family must improve and that the children must attend school and visit health clinics&#13;
regularly. This will require trained staff and resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.     Developing Links with Labor-intensive Public Works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45.    Policymakers should establish close links between the labor-intensive public works&#13;
program and other services and programs that can help its beneficiaries to rise out of&#13;
poverty. A recent DFID study stressed the need to focus on helping the poorest to rise out&#13;
of poverty. It suggested that the program should not only provide beneficiaries predictable&#13;
transfers in return for their labor but also include training or technical assistance so that&#13;
beneficiaries can improve or develop their skills. These services may also include a savings&#13;
component combined with financial literacy training. Once beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; financial literacy is&#13;
assured, microcredit for agricultural production or income-generating activities can&#13;
gradually be introduced. This microcredit component can build on the experience of Village&#13;
Savings and Loan Associations in which groups of women provide collateral for each other&#13;
to take out small loans while learning about savings, credit, and running a small enterprise.&#13;
It may also include some simple form of micro-insurance added directly to the savings&#13;
element (perhaps consisting of life insurance and funeral expenses). Again the program may&#13;
build on pre-existing forms of mutual insurance such as funeral associations. It is important&#13;
to stress that all of these services should be provided by specialized agencies and that the&#13;
MMAS and INAS should not try to duplicate these services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxv&#13;
&amp;#12;D.     Third Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46.    In the third stage, the GOM should evaluate the new programs, make any&#13;
corrections suggested by the evaluations, expand the successful interventions to reach as&#13;
many eligible beneficiaries as resources permit, and tighten the links with other programs&#13;
and services. Coordination with the NGOs should be strengthened, and the fragmentation&#13;
and duplication of interventions reduced even further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.     Institutional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47.    To implement all the activities contemplated in the three stages, it will be necessary&#13;
for the MMAS and INAS to be substantially strengthened. Several studies have revealed&#13;
some of the organizational weaknesses of the MMAS and INAS. Some measures have been&#13;
implemented to address INASâ&#128;&#153;s weaknesses. For example, financial controls are being&#13;
improved. An existing internal audit unit was recently strengthened, and the budget&#13;
management system e-SISTAFE is now operating in 11 of INAS 30 regional offices (in all&#13;
provincial capitals). As discussed, the ILO is supporting INAS in developing and&#13;
implementing a new MIS. INAS is also working on a new organization scheme and a plan for&#13;
staff development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.    There are many plans and coordinating bodies in Mozambique, but there is still a&#13;
lack of coordination across sectors, with most programs unable to exploit the synergies that&#13;
could be generated from closer coordination in designing and implementing programs. At&#13;
the local level, this is a challenge because of the absence of clear definitions of the roles of&#13;
the different actors. There is a need to establish clear roles and responsibilities for all those&#13;
involved in program implementation as well as an appropriate system of incentives and&#13;
accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxvi&#13;
&amp;#12;49.    The Decree that regulates the basic social security sub-system (Decree No. 85/2009)&#13;
in Article 5 also created the Council for the Coordination of the Basic Social Security&#13;
Subsystem. This inter-sectoral body comprises the ministries that oversee Direct Social&#13;
Action (MMAS), Education Social Action (the Ministry of Education), Health Social Action&#13;
(the Ministry of Health), and those that oversee Productive Social Action (the Ministries of&#13;
Planning and Development, Agriculture, Labor, Public Works and Housing, and State&#13;
Administration) as well as the private and public entities involved in providing social&#13;
assistance. The Council is mandated to coordinate the implementation of the basic social&#13;
security sub-system. It has the potential to play an important role in coordinating programs&#13;
across sectors and in creating the synergies necessary to leverage resources and increase&#13;
the effectiveness of social protection interventions. Therefore, it should be established as&#13;
soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50.    Social protection information also needs to be improved. All major social assistance&#13;
programs should have adequate management and M&amp;E systems. INASâ&#128;&#153;s budget should&#13;
include all of its program expenditures instead of these being buried under General State&#13;
Obligations as is currently the case. Future household surveys should include questions that&#13;
would yield the necessary information to evaluate the incidence of the major social&#13;
assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;            Chapter 1: Context, Purpose, and Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
A.        Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
51.       Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s economy grew by about 7.5 percent per year between 1992 and&#13;
2009 and poverty fell from over 70 percent to about 60 percent between 1996 and 2003.&#13;
However, progress in reducing poverty over the last few years has been substantially lower&#13;
because growth was less inclusive with no visible gains in production and productivity in&#13;
labor-intensive sectors particularly in subsistence agriculture.6 Poverty incidence is still&#13;
affecting more than half of Mozambicans. With a population of 22.9 million and per capita&#13;
income of only US$471, Mozambique remains one the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest countries (Table 1.1).&#13;
Food represents more than two-thirds of the average consumption of poor households. It is&#13;
estimated that about 20 percent of the population is food-insecure, and almost half of&#13;
children under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished. Extremely poor and vulnerable&#13;
households are highly exposed both to seasonal shocks (like the annual dry season) and to&#13;
frequent but unpredictable non-seasonal shocks (like cyclones, floods, or significant&#13;
variations in fuel or food prices). The recent economic slowdown may have reversed some&#13;
of the earlier gains in poverty reduction and has negatively affected household&#13;
consumption. This is a clear indication that Mozambique needs an effective social&#13;
protection system (SPS) to protect and promote the most vulnerable from the negative&#13;
effects of shocks and to foster their inclusion in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic and social&#13;
development process.&#13;

&#13;
52.     The Government of Mozambique (GOM) has made progress in developing a general&#13;
framework for social protection but still faces the challenge of putting it into operation an&#13;
effective strategy. Law 4 of 2007 organized social protection in Mozambique into three&#13;
pillars: basic, compulsory, and complementary social security. Basic social security&#13;
essentially consists of non-contributory transfers and other welfare services. Compulsory&#13;
social security is basically social insurance for formal workers and public servants, which is&#13;
currently very limited in coverage. Complementary social security is insurance that would&#13;
complement, on a voluntary basis, the compulsory pillar; it has yet to be developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
53.     Early in 2010, the government approved the National Basic Social Security Strategy&#13;
(SeguranÃ§a Social BÃ¡sica or ENSSB) covering the period 2010 to 2014. The ENSSB aims to&#13;
extend social protection coverage with the objective of including poor and vulnerable&#13;
populations in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s development process. The ENSSB has four parts:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (i) Direct Social Action, in which the government has made further efforts to&#13;
organize social assistance interventions. These are mainly transfer programs for the poor&#13;
and vulnerable who are unable to work, as well as short-term, in-kind transfers provided in&#13;
response to temporary vulnerabilities and other social welfare services. The Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      2&#13;
&amp;#12;Women and Social Action (MMAS) and the National Institute of Social Action (INAS) are&#13;
responsible for the interventions in this category including the main unconditional cash&#13;
transfer program, the Food Subsidy Program (Programa Subsidio de Alimentos or PSA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (ii) Education Social Action, managed by the Ministry of Education. This includes&#13;
social protection programs such as school feeding that aim to facilitate access to basic&#13;
education, thus increasing enrollment and attendance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (iii) Health Social Action, overseen by the Ministry of Health. This includes measures&#13;
and programs to promote access to basic health care for vulnerable groups (such as people&#13;
with HIV) as well as nutrition interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       (iv) Productive Social Action, a cross-sectoral approach that aims to increase access&#13;
to income-generating opportunities for the poor and vulnerable who are able to work&#13;
through employment and livelihood interventions, including public works and social funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54.    Even though the ENSSB provides a framework for the future development of&#13;
comprehensive safety net interventions, most of its operational aspects are still being&#13;
defined, especially those in the Direct Action and Productive Social Action areas. Several&#13;
studies or evaluations have been done of specific programs or target groups, but there is&#13;
still no comprehensive analysis of the social protection landscape in Mozambique with a&#13;
vision of an effective social protection system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.     Purpose&#13;
&#13;

55.    The objective of this study is to assist the Government of Mozambique in the&#13;
consolidation and implementation of the ENSSB by reviewing of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s social safety&#13;
net programs and social protection expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;56.         To meet its objectives, the study uses the so-called lifecycle (or life-course) analysis&#13;
and is organized as follows. After a brief discussion in Chapter I of the main risks facing&#13;
families in Mozambique and of the conceptual framework underpinning this assessment,&#13;
Chapter II identifies the main vulnerable groups, discusses the principal risks that these&#13;
groups and households in general face, and estimates the number of individuals or&#13;
households who are at risk. Chapter III reviews the principal programs that are in place to&#13;
address these risks. Chapter IV assesses the adequacy of the social protection system by&#13;
analyzing the following: (i) spending and budget arrangements; (ii) program coverage, gaps,&#13;
and overlaps; (iii) the generosity of benefits; (iv) targeting and selection mechanisms; (v)&#13;
cost-effectiveness; (vi) institutional and coordination arrangements; (vii) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; and (viii) sustainability. Chapter V presents the conclusion and&#13;
recommendations. Annex I presents the questionnaire that we used to collect information&#13;
on the social assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.          Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
57.         The poor and vulnerable in Mozambique face a series of risks. These risks result&#13;
from: (i) macroeconomic disturbances and consequent variations in employment, income,&#13;
and consumption; (ii) natural disasters and seasonal climate-related shocks; and (iii)&#13;
microeconomic conditions that expose the poorest families to a series of adverse situations.&#13;
The social protection system (SPS) must minimize the impact of these risks through an&#13;
integrated strategy that involves social and market insurance, self-insurance, and self-&#13;
protection as well as fiscal policies, sectoral policies, and natural disaster management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58.         In order to diminish the risks associated with cyclical variations in economic activity,&#13;
an integral approach to social protection (SP) is needed.7 For example, policy options for&#13;
mitigating the impact of terms of trade deterioration include resorting to market insurance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
    See De Ferranti et al (2000), p. 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    4&#13;
&amp;#12;mechanisms such as future contracts in the international markets and self-insurance&#13;
mechanisms such as the diversification of external trade. Options for addressing the&#13;
volatility of private capital include using contingent lines of credit. On the other hand, in&#13;
order to minimize the adverse impact of fluctuations in economic activity, it is important to&#13;
contain fiscal expenditures in times of economic expansion so that it is possible to increase&#13;
expenditures in times of recession. Maintaining a solid financial system is fundamental to&#13;
ensuring that the depositorsâ&#128;&#153; funds are preserved and that credit and other services are&#13;
available to firms and families, particularly during difficult economic periods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59.      Mozambique is highly vulnerable to recurrent natural disasters, particularly&#13;
droughts, floods, and cyclones. In the last 20 years, Mozambique has experienced eight&#13;
major droughts, sixteen major floods, two coastal floods or storm surges, and nine tropical&#13;
cyclones, all of which caused loss of life and severe economic damage.8 Therefore, it is&#13;
necessary to invest in national infrastructure to reduce its vulnerability to natural disasters&#13;
and to develop and implement sound land use and natural resource management policies.&#13;
In order to prevent or mitigate these climate-related risks, it is sometimes necessary to&#13;
resettle populations living in high-risk zones and to adopt civic education and disaster&#13;
preparedness programs. When disaster strikes, emergency relief plans must be capable of&#13;
responding rapidly to assist victims, minimize shocks, and begin the restoration of&#13;
livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.      Microeconomic vulnerability exists when poor households face risks related to the&#13;
conditions in which they live.9 These risks can involve a lack of assets, employment, income-&#13;
generating opportunities, and/or access to basic services. They can also consist of other&#13;
conditions that can affect certain groups such as the elderly; orphaned, abandoned, or&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;

Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.&#13;
9&#13;
  Risks may be classified as idiosyncratic when they only affect one individual or household (i.e. death of the&#13;
breadwinner) or covariate when they affect several households or even the whole country (i.e. the recent oil&#13;
price shock).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&amp;#12;abused children; the physically disabled; or the chronically ill including those living with&#13;
HIV/AIDS. Existing microeconomic vulnerabilities can magnify the impact of macroeconomic&#13;
disturbances or natural disasters. For example, if poor workers have no skills, then they may&#13;
find it difficult to secure employment in good economic times, but in bad economic times,&#13;
their chances will be even lower because there will be a large pool of well-qualified job&#13;
seekers competing for fewer jobs. On the other hand, individuals and families can adopt&#13;
certain coping strategies to diminish their vulnerability to macroeconomic risks associated&#13;
with changes in economic activity or natural disasters. For example, if one member of a&#13;
farmerâ&#128;&#153;s family is employed in a non-agricultural job, this diversifies the familyâ&#128;&#153;s sources of&#13;
income. Other coping strategies include opening a savings account (diversification of&#13;
assets), participating in a training course (investment in human capital), and contributing to&#13;
a pension (insurance). These are self-insurance, self-protection, and market insurance&#13;
strategies at the individual level, all of which help to mitigate the negative effects of risks&#13;
that may affect entire communities or even the entire country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
61.        This assessment of Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system focuses primarily on&#13;
these microeconomic risks affecting poor families, but it also discusses the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
vulnerability to natural disasters and seasonal climate-related shocks. It is based on an&#13;
analytical framework of social risk management (SRM)10 developed by the World Bank in&#13;
the early 2000s. Social risk management aims at reducing key risks and breaking the inter-&#13;
generational cycle of poverty and vulnerability (see Box 1.1). Risk management consists of&#13;
choosing the most appropriate risk reduction, mitigation, and coping strategies to minimize&#13;
the adverse impact of social risks. In practice, social protection includes social insurance (SI)&#13;
measures such as unemployment, disability, or sickness benefits or old age pension that&#13;
mitigate risks; social assistance programs (SA) such as transfers in cash or kind, subsidies,&#13;
and workfare that help people to cope with risks; and programs that build human capital&#13;
such as conditional cash transfers, labor-intensive public works, and other programs that, by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
     Holzmann and Jorgensen (2000).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                6&#13;
&amp;#12;helping integrate poor and vulnerable people into the labor market, reduce risk in the first&#13;
place.&#13;
                                      Box 1.1: Risk and Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
The terms risk and vulnerability are sometimes used interchangeably because people or households that are&#13;
at risk are usually considered to be vulnerable, and vice versa. Risk is the probability of a loss or injury. Its&#13;
potential negative impact can occur as the result of some present process or future event. In the context of&#13;
poverty analysis, vulnerability is defined by the World Bank as the probability or risk today of being in poverty&#13;
or of falling into deeper poverty in the future. It is a key dimension of welfare, since a risk of large changes in&#13;
income can prompt households to reduce their investments in productive assets and human capital. Because&#13;
vulnerability can influence household behavior and coping strategies, it is an important factor to consider&#13;
when devising poverty reduction policies. For example, the fear of bad weather conditions or the fear of being&#13;
expelled from the land that they cultivate can deter vulnerable households from investing in more risky but&#13;
higher productivity crops and thus reduce their capacity to generate income.&#13;

62.        There is no single recipe for how to configure an effective social protection system.&#13;
An effective SPS may vary from one country to another and in time. For example, systems in&#13;
low-income countries may consist only of a set of core social assistance programs for the&#13;
very poor, such as a cash transfer or food-for-work program or insurance for old age.&#13;
Systems in middle-income countries may include more sophisticated programs such as&#13;
conditional cash transfers (CCTs), disability insurance, and active labor market programs&#13;
(that help young people transition from school to work, or that provide training or job&#13;
search assistance). Systems in high-income countries may also include health and&#13;
unemployment insurance and more comprehensive labor market policies.11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63.        In reviewing this assessment of Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s current social protection system, it is&#13;
important to bear in mind the attributes of a "good" social protection system. A recent&#13;
World Bank study has identified the attributes of a good social safety net system (or set of&#13;
social assistance programs) as follows: 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
     Grosh et al (2008) p.415.&#13;
12&#13;
     Ibid, p. 373.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;   ï&#130;·   Appropriateness. The range of social assistance programs and the balance between&#13;
them and other elements of public policies must respond to particular needs of the country.&#13;
Each program must fit the particular circumstances of the country. The total amount of&#13;
resources allocated to the social protection system and how they are distributed must be in&#13;
accordance with the risk profile of the country and the fiscal space.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Adequacy (generosity). The safety net must cover all groups at risk and in need of&#13;
assistance, particularly the poor and those at risk of falling into poverty. Individual programs&#13;
must cover the entire target population and provide meaningful benefits to whichever&#13;
subset of the population they are meant to assist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Equity (incidence). The safety net should give equal treatment to people in similar&#13;
situations (horizontal equity) and greater benefits to the poorest families (vertical equity).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Cost-effectiveness. The safety net programs should channel most of the resources&#13;
to their intended target group. Administrative costs should be reasonable. Program&#13;
fragmentation and duplication should be avoided. Social assistance programs should be run&#13;
efficiently with the minimum resources required to achieve the desired impact but with&#13;
sufficient resources to carry out all program functions well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Compatibility with desired incentives. Social assistance programs provide benefits&#13;
to people and thereby influence their behavior. Programs must not provide incentives that&#13;
alter the behavior of individuals in undesirable ways (for example, encouraging them to&#13;
work less).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Sustainability. The safety net should be sustainable from a fiscal, administrative, and&#13;
political perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;      ï&#130;·   Evolution. The range and appropriate balance of programs will change as the&#13;
economy grows, as other elements of policy develop, or when shocks occur. The&#13;
management of specific programs should also evolve as problems are solved and new&#13;
standards are set.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64.       Most of these attributes should also be present in social insurance systems. For&#13;
example, social insurance systems should be adequate enough to help recipients to smooth&#13;
their consumption, equitable, cost-effective, and sustainable, and should not provide any&#13;
undesirable incentives. Chapter IV of this paper will refer to these attributes in evaluating&#13;
Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system and in answering the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;·   How adequate is the social protection system to meet the needs of the various groups&#13;
that require assistance?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;·   How cost-effective are the social protection programs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;·   How responsive is the social protection system in addressing emerging&#13;
vulnerabilities?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Is the range of existing programs appropriate for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s needs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;                         Chapter 2: Analysis of Risks and Vulnerabilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65.         In this section, the most vulnerable groups in Mozambique and the principal risks&#13;
that they face during their lifecycle are identified. It focuses on the major risks facing&#13;
individuals and families that, if they are not addressed, can perpetuate the inter-&#13;
generational transmission of poverty. The identification of risk is done on the basis of the&#13;
analysis of the situation of the poor and vulnerable groups in the country, drawing&#13;
extensively on the IOF 2008/09 and existing studies. The final list of risk and vulnerable&#13;
groups was arrived at after consulting with key public institutions, partners, and other&#13;
stakeholders involved in Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system and incorporating their&#13;
suggestions to the initial list presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.          Major Risks and Vulnerable Groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66.         The major risks facing households are falling into or being trapped in poverty. Poor&#13;
households are more vulnerable to shocks than rich ones because they lack the resource&#13;
base and assets to overcome the negative impact of these shocks. This section discusses&#13;
poverty incidence, the determinants of poverty and their relation to householdâ&#128;&#153;s wealth ,&#13;
and the shocks and food insecurity experienced by Mozambicansâ&#128;&#153; households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.          Poverty, Determinants of Poverty, and Wealth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
67.         Between 1997 and 2003, Mozambique succeeded in reducing poverty (measured by&#13;
consumption) from 69 percent to 54 percent in 2003. This was a result of broad-based,&#13;
labor-intensive, private-sector-led growth. At the same time, increased investments in&#13;
social and economic infrastructure extended access to public services to previously&#13;
underserved Mozambicans and improved their welfare.13&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
     World Bank (2008), Vol. I, p. xiv.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;68.     The major determinants of poverty in Mozambique are demographic, educational,&#13;
and occupational factors. According the World Bank Poverty Assessment of 2008, poorer&#13;
households tend to be larger, have a higher proportion of children, have a higher&#13;
dependency ratio, contain a higher proportion of disabled adults, be predominantly rural,&#13;
and have less education. Female-headed households have a higher representation in the&#13;
bottom quintiles.14 Education is strongly correlated with higher consumption of households,&#13;
and households whose heads work in agriculture are among the poorest.15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69.     A similar analysis conducted by Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development comparing IOF 2008/09 and IAF 2002/03 concluded that the determinants of&#13;
poverty continue to be related to the demographic, educational, occupational, and&#13;
geographical characteristics of households.16 Having few household members and working&#13;
in the transport and service sectors including public services (as compared to agriculture)&#13;
were both consistently associated with lower poverty. Returns to education were also&#13;
higher if the level of education of household members is higher.17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70.     Poorer households tend to spend a higher share of their budget on food and have&#13;
fewer assets (wealth).18 Indeed, a recent study on food security and vulnerability conducted&#13;
by the World Food Program (WFP) found a close relationship between the lack of asset&#13;
ownership and poverty.19 The study concluded that â&#128;&#156;There is a clear relationship between&#13;
asset wealth and household food security as measured by food consumption, suggesting&#13;
that asset ownership can be efficiently used to target households for food assistance. As&#13;
asset wealth decreases, the percentage of households with acceptable consumption also&#13;

&amp;#12;decreases, from 87 percent for asset rich, 74 percent for asset medium households and 60&#13;
percent for asset poor households.â&#128;&#157;20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
71.     The Ministry of Planning and Developmentâ&#128;&#153;s Third National Poverty Assessment of&#13;
2010 also found that the regions with the biggest increases in household asset ownership&#13;
between IAF02 and IOF08 had also generally seen the largest reductions in poverty. The&#13;
study found that the increase in ownership of consumer durables has been larger in the&#13;
south, particularly in comparison to the rural central region of the country, and that there&#13;
was a negative correlation between the two variables. 21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72.     There is little difference in the level of per capita consumption or expenditures&#13;
among the lowest four quintiles of wealth in Mozambique. Figure 2.1 plots food&#13;
consumption and total consumption per capita by wealth quintiles from IOF 08/09.22 As can&#13;
be observed, the distribution of per capita consumption (total and food) is almost flat for&#13;
the first four quintiles. The implication of this is that it is difficult to differentiate the poor&#13;
from the near poor based solely on the basis of consumption expenditure or income.&#13;

   This study does not use the 2008/2009 consumption data to build the household quintiles due to the&#13;
relevant underestimation identified by a preliminary overview on the data done by the World Bank. According&#13;
to this overview about 25 percent of household consume less than 1000 calories per capita daily while&#13;
showing characteristics typical of non-poor households such as relatively high education and above the&#13;
average ownership of assets. As a substitute it was used the Filmer and Pritchett asset index which takes into&#13;
account asset ownership and housing. The index was obtained by aggregating the asset information through a&#13;
factor component procedure. (see Filmer and Pritchett, 2001).&#13;

2.         Poverty, Food Insecurity, and Shocks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
73.        The poor (or the near-poor) are usually the most vulnerable group in a society&#13;
because they do not have the assets (either human or physical) to respond to adverse&#13;
shocks and, therefore, have a high probability of becoming poorer (or poor). As discussed&#13;
above in Box 1.1, in the context of poverty analysis, vulnerability is the probability or risk&#13;
today of being in poverty or of falling into deeper poverty in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74.        According to the Poverty and Vulnerability Survey (PVS) conducted by the World&#13;
Bank in 2006, the most common covariate risks facing Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s households were&#13;
shocks caused by climatic changes or natural disasters (such as droughts or floods), a&#13;
downturn in the local economy, a sudden worsening of the internal terms of trade, or a&#13;
health crisis (such as cholera). The main idiosyncratic shocks included hunger, the illness or&#13;
death of a family member, unemployment, and the loss of crops. The seasonality of&#13;
vulnerability affected both communities and individuals.23 The most common shocks,&#13;

&amp;#12;particularly for the poorest households in urban and rural areas, were the illness of a family&#13;
member and drought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
75.        Geographic factors affect vulnerability. Table 2.1 shows the prevalence of household&#13;
food insecurity by province as well as vulnerability to natural adverse weather conditions.&#13;
The highest percentage of the acutely food-insecure is found in Cabo Delgado (39 percent),&#13;
followed by Gaza (34 percent) and Maputo (28 percent) provinces (see Box 2.1). The highest&#13;
percentage of chronically food-insecure households is found in Tete (45 percent) and&#13;
ZambÃ©zia (45 percent) provinces, followed by Niassa (44 percent). Nampula province has&#13;
the highest percentage of better-off households (35 percent), followed by Sofala (27&#13;
percent) and Maputo (24 percent) provinces. Overall, the highest percentages of acute plus&#13;
chronic food-insecure households are found equally in Niassa, Cabo Delgado, and Tete&#13;
provinces.24 Niassa is exposed to cyclones and Cabo Delgado and Tete to droughts.&#13;

&amp;#12;                      Box 2.1: The Characteristics of Food-insecure Households&#13;
The determination of food insecurity is based on a cluster analysis of the following three variables from the&#13;
household data: Food consumption score (a measure of current household food security); number of&#13;
different types of assets (a measure of wealth or ability to access food); and coping strategies index (a&#13;
measure of stress on the household, related to food access). The characteristics of acute and chronic food&#13;
insecurity are detailed below.&#13;
&#13;
Acute food insecurity â&#128;&#147; These households are characterized by having 4 people on average. They are the most&#13;
likely to be headed by a woman (32 percent) or an elderly person (22 percent) as well as to have a disabled&#13;
member (15 percent) or chronically ill member (8 percent). They are also the most likely to have experienced&#13;
the recent death of a household member (6 percent). Seventeen percent of the households are hosting&#13;
orphans which are not different from the other groups. About half the households have access to drinking&#13;
water from improved sources while only 7 percent have adequate sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Only 84 percent of these households have access to arable land while 65 percent live in rural areas. Just over&#13;
half own any livestock. More than 40 percent of the households are asset poor while 46 percent of their&#13;
monthly expenditure is for food, the highest of all groups. Only 9 percent are receiving assistance through a&#13;
program. Nearly 20 percent of the households reported an unusual event or shock that affected their food&#13;
security in the 6 months prior to the survey, the highest of all groups. The main shocks reported were:&#13;
poor/irregular rainfall (45 percent); theft or loss of assets (19 percent); the high price of inputs (15 percent);&#13;
and wild animal attacks (11 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Chronic food insecurity â&#128;&#147; These households are characterized by having 4 people on average.&#13;
Only 12 percent are headed by a woman and 20 percent headed by an elderly person, the second highest of&#13;
all groups. Eleven percent have a disabled member, 5 percent have a chronically ill member and only 4&#13;
percent have experienced the recent death of a member. Seventeen percent are hosting orphans. Less than&#13;
half of these households access drinking water from improved sources, the lowest of all groups while only&#13;
7 percent have adequate sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Around 93 percent of these households have access to arable land while 68 percent live in rural areas â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
highest of all groups for both. While more than 60 percent own any livestock more than 40 percent of the&#13;
households are asset poor and 45 percent of their monthly expenditure is for food, the second highest of all&#13;
groups. Only 6 percent are receiving assistance through a program which is the lowest of all groups. Ten&#13;
percent of these households reported an unusual event or shock that affected their food security in the 6&#13;
months prior to the survey, the second highest of all groups. The main shocks reported were: Poor/irregular&#13;
rainfall (45 percent); Death of a family member (16 percent); Wild animal attacks (14 percent); Chronic illness&#13;
of HH member (14 percent).&#13;

76.      Mozambique is highly vulnerable to shocks either recurrent natural disasters,&#13;
particularly droughts, floods, and cyclones or predictable seasonal shocks (lean season) 25.&#13;
&#13;
25&#13;
  In the last twenty years, Mozambique experienced 8 major droughts, 16 major floods, 2 costal floods/storm&#13;
surges, and 9 tropical cyclones, causing loss of live and severe economic damage. "EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED&#13;

&amp;#12;According to a 2007 FAO assessment, 20 of the 128 districts in the country are â&#128;&#156;highly prone&#13;
to droughtâ&#128;&#157;, 30 to flooding, and 7 to both. Poor and nearly poor households are also&#13;
exposed to annual seasonal shocks and a significant proportion of households, especially&#13;
those in rural areas, are exposed to food insecurity.26 During the months of December&#13;
through March, an increase number of households experience food shortages peaking at&#13;
over 40 percent during the months of January and February then increasing until post&#13;
harvest in August to start increasing again (Chart 2.3). This pattern is particularly marked in&#13;
rural areas of the four provinces in central Mozambique. It is estimated that about 40&#13;
percent more calories are consumed in good months compared with the lean season 27.&#13;

77.    In Mozambique, a large share of the population is near the poverty line. Figure 2.3&#13;
shows that over 60 percent of all Mozambicans are below the poverty line plus 10 percent,&#13;
and two-thirds are below the poverty line plus 25 percent. In the Northern region, nearly 80&#13;
percent are below the poverty line plus 25 percent. This makes these Mozambicans very&#13;
vulnerable to small variations in income, whether seasonal or annual.&#13;

78.    According to data from IOF 08/09, for the households the most important shock that&#13;
occurred in the last five years was an increase in food prices (reported by 36.5 percent of&#13;
the households); this was followed by drought (19.8 percent) and some idiosyncratic shocks&#13;
such death of another household member (10.8 percent ) or illness (8.1 percent) ( Chart&#13;
2.1). Increase in food prices affected more urban households, as some households in rural&#13;
areas might be net producers. The poorest households were affected relatively more than&#13;
richer households by agricultural pests, drought, cyclones, floods and low producer prices.&#13;

 79.    A recent study 28 estimates the relative impact of six shocks (death, floods and&#13;
 cyclones, illness, agricultural pests, drought, and theft) on the chronic and transient&#13;
 poverty, by comparing household food expenditures per person per day to regional food&#13;
 poverty lines29. Of the three climatic shocks considered in the study, floods and cyclones&#13;
 have the strongest impact on household expenditures, reducing them by about 32 percent.&#13;
 Agricultural pests and drought are estimated to have an impact of approximately 17&#13;
 percent. However, the impact on householdsâ&#128;&#153; expenditure from idiosyncratic shocks is&#13;
 even higher. It is estimated that the death of a breadwinner may cause a reduction in&#13;
 householdâ&#128;&#153;s expenditure by mover 50 percent, while illness would reduce it in about 25&#13;
 percent.&#13;

Economics, Virginia Tech, February 2011.&#13;
29&#13;
   Food expenditures are estimated based on observed household assets and exposure to shocks (Annex 1).&#13;
Households which are estimated to fall below the food poverty line based on asset levels in the absence of&#13;
shocks are considered to be chronically poor. Households estimated to fall below the food poverty line after&#13;
exposure to shocks are defined as the transient poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          19&#13;
&amp;#12;80.   Ex-ante simulations predict that the impact of covariate shocks is significant in terms&#13;
of poverty headcount. Flood and cyclones would increase poverty rates by more than 2&#13;
percentage points. Higher impacts are expected in Nampula, ZambÃ©zia and Sofala, as they&#13;
are coastal provinces and are also exposed to annual flooding of the Zambezi river and&#13;
Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s cyclone season. Drought is estimated to increase national poverty rate by 2&#13;
percentage points, with the highest impact in the rural areas of Southern and Central&#13;
provinces, a much drier regions than the north and experiencing recurrent periods of&#13;
draught. Finally, agricultural pests have a smaller impact in transient poverty by an&#13;
estimated of 1.2 percentage points; rural areas in the northern and central provinces suffer&#13;
the highest impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
81.   In sum, Mozambique has maintained a fairly stable economy and political&#13;
environment since the end of the civil war in 1992. However, while receiving considerable&#13;
recognition for its reconstruction efforts and structural reforms, Mozambique still suffers&#13;
for a national poverty which affects more than half of its population. Many Mozambicans&#13;
are near the poverty line as the distribution of poverty is quite flat in the lowest four&#13;
quintiles of the consumption distribution. Geography determines the extent to which a&#13;
population is exposed to shocks and food insecurity. The implication of this is that it is&#13;
difficult to differentiate the poor from the near poor based solely on consumption&#13;
expenditures or income. Furthermore, efforts to address poverty and food insecurity in&#13;
Mozambique are further complicated by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to shocks. This&#13;
suggests that, in addition to geographic factors, household characteristics are very&#13;
important in targeting programs on the poor, but at the same time a key elements in an SP&#13;
strategy are seasonal and unexpected shocks affecting vast proportions of the poor.&#13;

&amp;#12;B.      Lifecycle Risk Analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
82.     The principal risks that poor and vulnerable Mozambicans face during their lifecycle&#13;
are discussed below. The review focuses on the major risks that, if not addressed, can&#13;
perpetuate the inter-generational transmission of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      0-5 Years Old&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
83.     The main risks that poor children 0-5 years old face are that they are born with low&#13;
weight, experience debilitating and life-threatening diseases, and have an inadequate diet&#13;
and lack early stimulation, both of which will impair their development and may perpetuate&#13;
their poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
84.     Poor Maternal and Child Care. The health of an infant depends on the health of the&#13;
mother. To promote the birth of healthy babies, the health authorities must ensure, first,&#13;
that reproductive health services are available so that all pregnancies are wanted&#13;
pregnancies and that pregnancies are sufficiently spaced. In Mozambique, 18.4 percent of&#13;
women (married or in a relationship) have unsatisfied needs for contraception services.30&#13;
Second, pregnant women should receive early and regular prenatal controls. The World&#13;
Health Organization (WHO) has established that all pregnant women should receive at least&#13;
four controls and immunization against tetanus. In Mozambique, 92.3 percent of pregnant&#13;
women received prenatal care at least once (99 percent in urban areas and 89.7 percent in&#13;
rural areas),31 and 79.3 percent of mothers were protected against tetanus (84 percent in&#13;
urban areas and 77.4 percent in rural areas).32 However, DHS 2003 indicated than only 53&#13;
percent of women attended four or more prenatal consultations.33 Third, the delivery of&#13;

                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;babies should be assisted by skilled attendants, but this is the case in only 55.3 percent of&#13;
births in Mozambique (78.3 percent in urban areas and 45.9 percent in rural areas).34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
85.        These gaps in medical attention translate into high maternal mortality rates, into&#13;
babies with low weight and whose resistance to diseases is low and/or who do not develop&#13;
well, and into high neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality rates (Table 2.2). According to the&#13;
National Assessment of Needs in Maternal and Newborn Health in Mozambique (AvaliaÃ§Ã£o&#13;
Nacional de Necessidades em SaÃºde Materna e Neonatal em MoÃ§ambique , ANN) of&#13;
2007/2008, the leading causes of institutional neonatal death are prematurity (50 percent),&#13;
acute asphyxia (32 percent), and neonatal sepsis (29 percent).35 These data show the&#13;
consequences of poor health and inadequate care during pregnancy, birth, and the first&#13;
days after birth, and the urgent need to increase the coverage of institutional deliveries and&#13;
essential newborn care.&#13;

&#13;
86.        Data from MICS 2008, DHS 2003, and DHS 1997 indicate that, while maternal and&#13;
under-5 mortality rates have been declining over the past 15 years, the pace of the decline&#13;
over the most recent five-year period has been slower than in previous periods. The data&#13;
also show that the rates remain high: maternal mortality at 408 per 100,000 and the&#13;
mortality of children under the age of 5 at 157 per 1,000 (average of the last 10 years). This&#13;

&amp;#12;compares with an average of 590 per 100,000 and 113 per 1,000 respectively for the low&#13;
income countries.36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
87.     Mortality rates vary widely between provinces (Table 2.2). For instance, Zambezia&#13;
has the highest under-5 mortality rate (206 per 1,000) while the province of Maputo has the&#13;
lowest rate (103 per 1,000). The National Survey on Causes of Mortality in Mozambique&#13;
2007/8 indicates that malaria is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5&#13;
(42.3 percent), followed by AIDS (13.4 percent), pneumonia (6.4 percent), and diarrhea (5.9&#13;
percent).37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88.     One of the interventions that contribute the most to the reducing infant mortality is&#13;
vaccination because it helps to reduce the incidence of preventable diseases. Data from the&#13;
MICS 2008 show progress in vaccination coverage of children under the age of 1 against the&#13;
major preventable diseases for BCG by 87 percent, DPT-3 dose by 71 percent, polio-3 dose&#13;
by 70 percent, and measles by 64 percent, though the increase in coverage has recently&#13;
decelerated.38 Similarly, the use of mosquito nets is one of the most effective ways to&#13;
prevent malaria, and there has been significant progress in this area with the percentage of&#13;
children under the age of 5 sleeping under a mosquito net increasing from 10 percent in&#13;
2003 to 42 percent (22.8 percent under a treated net) in 2008, with a faster increase in rural&#13;
areas.39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.     Malnutrition in Children. Low weight at birth because of inadequate food intake by&#13;
mothers can lead to the premature death of their babies or poor development in the early&#13;
years of life. In Mozambique, 16 percent of children are born with low weight (15.8 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
   World Development Indicators (WDI). It should be noted that the comparable WDI maternal mortality ratio&#13;
estimate for Mozambique is 550 per 100,000.&#13;

&amp;#12;in urban and 16.1 percent in rural areas).40 A lack of breastfeeding, low food intake in&#13;
infants, and inadequate feeding practices are critical risks for children because they can lead&#13;
to stunted development, illness, and early death. WHO recommends mothers to start&#13;
breastfeeding within the first hour of their babyâ&#128;&#153;s life and exclusively during the first six&#13;
months. In Mozambique, while 63.2 percent of children were breastfed within the first hour&#13;
(59.6 percent in urban areas and 64.7 percent in rural areas), only 37 percent of the children&#13;
were breastfed exclusively from birth to five months (34 percent in urban areas and 38&#13;
percent in rural areas).41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90.     As in other developing countries, anemia and micronutrient deficiencies are serious&#13;
public health risks in Mozambique. Anemia is an indicator of poor nutrition, poor health,&#13;
and an increased risk of maternal and child mortality. Although the primary cause of anemia&#13;
is iron deficiency, this often coexists with a number of other causes, such as malaria,&#13;
parasitic infection, HIV/AIDS, and nutritional deficiencies.42 Vitamin A deficiency in pregnant&#13;
women causes night blindness and may increase the risk of maternal mortality, while in&#13;
children it is a leading cause of preventable blindness and increases the risk of disease and&#13;
death from severe infections. DHS 2003 indicated that only one in five women in&#13;
Mozambique received vitamin A after giving birth and only 39 took iron supplements.&#13;
Among children aged 6 to 59 months, one-half consumed vitamin A supplements while the&#13;
other half consumed foods rich in vitamins.43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
91.     According to MICS 2008, the high prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children&#13;
aged 0 to 6 months (21.4 percent) may be related to one or more of the following factors:&#13;
(i) poor nutritional status of the mother before and during pregnancy; (ii) the babyâ&#128;&#153;s low&#13;
weight at birth; (iii) illness; and (iv) the child not being exclusively breastfed.44 The level of&#13;

&amp;#12;chronic malnutrition increases for children aged 2 years old (53 percent) and then declines&#13;
for four year olds (42.1 percent). Table 2.3 indicates that chronic malnutrition for children&#13;
under the age of 5 is 43.7 percent (1.7 million children in 2010), 46.8 percent for boys&#13;
(917,809) and 40.7 percent for girls (804,764), ranging from a low of 24.9 percent in the city&#13;
of Maputo to 55.7 percent in Cabo Delgado.45&#13;

92.        Lack of Birth Registration. The United Nationsâ&#128;&#153; Convention on the Rights of the Child&#13;
states that every child has the right to a name and a nationality and the right to protection&#13;
from being deprived of his or her identity. Birth registration is a fundamental way to secure&#13;
these rights. Children who are not registered are not only â&#128;&#156;invisibleâ&#128;&#157; but from an&#13;
institutional and legal standpoint they are â&#128;&#156;non-existent.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
93.        In Mozambique, Article 26 of the Law 7/2008 on the Promotion and Protection of&#13;
the Rights of the Child states that all children have the rights to a name of their own and to&#13;
a family surname, to be registered, and to have a nationality. The Law also states that all&#13;
health units are obliged to identify any newborn infant and to provide him or her with a&#13;
birth certificate. However, only 30.8 percent of children under the age of 5 are registered,&#13;
with boys and girls having similar percentages (31 percent and 30.7 respectively). This&#13;
implies that there are 2.7 million children under the age of 5 who are not registered (1.3&#13;
million boys and 1.4 million girls). Registration is higher in urban areas (38.5 percent) than in&#13;
rural areas (27.8 percent). While 47.7 percent of those in the richest quintile are registered,&#13;
&#13;
45&#13;
     Population estimates for 2010 are from National Institute of Statistics (2010b), Quadro 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          25&#13;
&amp;#12;only 19.5 percent of those in the poorest quintiles are.46 Figure 2.4 indicates that the major&#13;
reasons given in surveys by those in the poorest quintiles for not registering their children&#13;
are distance (the registration centers are a long way away), cost (registering is too&#13;
expensive), and complexity (the registering process is too complicated). However, the&#13;
survey does not capture key cultural considerations. A senior education official indicated&#13;
that, while the GOM has established registry offices in many health clinics, parents do not&#13;
immediately register their newborn because it is customary first to consult with other family&#13;
members and even the community before a name is given to the baby. This process can&#13;
take months in some cases, thus making the registration process more difficult.&#13;

94.        Lack of Early Childhood Stimulation. As was made clear in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s World&#13;
Development Report 2006, there is solid evidence that early childhood development (ECD)&#13;
programs benefit poor children and families. Nutritional supplementation and stimulation&#13;

&amp;#12;interventions administrated concurrently, especially to poor children under the age of 2&#13;
years old, can help malnourished children to catch up with other children with â&#128;&#156;normalâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
development.47 Early stimulation, enrollment in pre-primary school, and participation in&#13;
other learning and school readiness activities also help children to develop and perform&#13;
better when they enter primary school. In Mozambique, only 31 percent of children under&#13;
the age of 5 (29.2 percent boys and 32.5 percent girls) were involved in (four or more)&#13;
activities that promote learning and school readiness (32.5 percent in urban areas and 30.2&#13;
percent in rural areas).48 Over one-quarter of the children (28 percent) were not living with&#13;
their biological fathers.49 In addition, only 3 percent of children under the age of 5 had&#13;
childrenâ&#128;&#153;s books at home (6 percent in urban areas and 2 percent in rural areas). 50 Indeed,&#13;
32.5 percent of children under the age of 5 were left with inadequate care (either alone or&#13;
in the care of children under 10 years old).51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
95.     In Mozambique, pre-school education is provided in the crÃ¨ches and kindergartens&#13;
mostly run by private institutions or community organizations. The Ministry of Women and&#13;
Social Action (MMAS) also runs some pre-school facilities (escolinhas). This level of&#13;
education is not compulsory. Ministry of Education officials in charge of the primary and&#13;
pre-primary levels have estimated that current pre-school net enrollment is only between 4&#13;
and 5 percent.52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
96.     In sum, while there has been progress in maternal and infant care during the last 15&#13;
years, the rate of progress has slowed down in recent years, and the maternal and under-5&#13;
mortality rates remain high compared to other low income countries. The vast majority of&#13;
children in Mozambique have no access to early child development or pre-school programs.&#13;

97.    For children of primary and secondary school age, the major risks are not attending&#13;
school because they did not enroll in the first place or because they were forced to drop out&#13;
of school for financial, early pregnancy, or other reasons. Another risk is that children&#13;
attend school but learn little. A low level of schooling almost invariably leads to poor job&#13;
market prospects, low salaries, and, possibly, a life in poverty. Within this group there are&#13;
several particularly vulnerable types of children that require special support including&#13;
orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) due to HIV/AIDS, abused and abandoned children,&#13;
child workers, children with disabilities, children who are sexually exploited and/or victims&#13;
of trafficking, and teens who are pregnant and/or in an early marriage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98.    Low School Attendance. Primary education in Mozambique is compulsory and free. It&#13;
is divided into two levels: lower primary (EP1), which consists of five years of schooling&#13;
(Grades 1 to 5), and upper primary (EP2), which comprises two years (Grades 6 and 7). The&#13;
official age for starting school is 6 years old, though late entrance has been the norm.&#13;
General secondary education is divided into two cycles: the first cycle (ESG1) comprises&#13;
three years (Grades 8 to 10), while the second cycle (ESG2) comprises two years (Grades 11&#13;
and 12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99.    Enrollment in primary school has increased sharply in recent years, but a significant&#13;
number of children still do not attend school. According to the Ministry of Education, in&#13;
2010 there were over 5 million children attending 13,434 primary schools and over 600,000&#13;
students attending 493 secondary schools (Table 2.4). At the primary level, most schooling&#13;
is provided by the public sector, whereas at the secondary level the private sector is the&#13;
majority supplier at the ESG2 level. Girlsâ&#128;&#153; enrollment is lower than that of boys at these&#13;
education levels. Late entrance and overage continues to be the norm. Over one-tenth of&#13;
those attending EP1 were older than 12 years.&#13;

100.          Using data on enrollment rates and population data from MICS 2008 and from&#13;
UNESCO for 2010, it is estimated that, at the primary level, there are 855,463 children aged&#13;
6 to 12 who do not attend school (404,729 and 450,734 girls). This corresponds to about 19&#13;
percent of the cohort (Table 2.5).53 At the secondary level, it is estimated that 944,164&#13;
children aged 13 to 17 are not in school (396,774 boys and 547,390 girls). This corresponds&#13;
to about 36 percent of the cohort. Girls have lower attendance rates than boys at both the&#13;
primary and secondary level, with a ratio of girls to boys of 0.97 in primary and 0.98 in&#13;
secondary school. For the 13 to 17 cohorts, there are nearly 40 percent more girls who are&#13;
out of school than boys, because more boys than girls are attending primary school.&#13;

primary school age who are out of school. A World Bank study found 785,376 primary-&#13;
school-age children out of school (345,596 boys and 439,780 girls) in 2009. 54On the other&#13;
hand, UNESCO data show the rate of primary-school-age children out of school as having&#13;
been 7.5 percent in 2010 (4.9 percent for boys and 10.2 percent for girls). This would reduce&#13;
the total number of children out of school to 343,239 (112,043 boys and 232,196 girls).&#13;
There is general agreement among all education observers that there has been a sharp&#13;
increase in enrollment in recent years that has contributed to high pupil-teacher ratios (see&#13;
below). Indeed, many primary schools have to operate in more than one shift because of&#13;
the shortage of school places at the primary level. According to a recent World Bank report,&#13;
a major achievement has been the reduction in late entrance and increase enrollment of&#13;
children aged 6 to 7 years as well as an increase in the primary school completion rate (at&#13;
the end of grade 7) from 34 percent in 2004 to 48 percent in 2009.55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102.       MICS 2008 data plotted in Figure 2.5 indicate that the number of primary-school-age&#13;
(6 to 12 years) children in the poorest quintile (Q1) who are out of school is over five times&#13;
the number in the richest quintile (Q5). Similarly, at secondary level, the number of children&#13;
aged 7 to 13 in the poorest quintile who are out of school is more than twice that of&#13;
children in the richest quintile.&#13;

103.   Since 2003, public primary education has been free and compulsory for all children&#13;
in Mozambique. The government also provides textbooks for primary education students. A&#13;
few primary public schools (5 percent) offer school lunches. Nonetheless, the cost of&#13;
schooling is not free for parents because of the opportunity cost of childrenâ&#128;&#153;s time and&#13;
other direct costs that the families must incur such as uniforms, school materials, additional&#13;
books, transport, and any other fees collected by the school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
104.   Table 2.6 presents estimates of the direct cost for parents of sending their children&#13;
to primary and secondary school. First note that many children do not attend school&#13;
because the school is too far away, they have other duties in the family or need to work to&#13;
bring in income, or the family simply cannot afford to send them to school. Of those that go&#13;
to school, the IOF 2008/09 data indicate that the annual cost for parents in the poorest&#13;
quintile of sending a child to primary and secondary school is 2.3 percent and 8 percent of&#13;
the householdâ&#128;&#153;s per capita food costs respectively. While the direct cost at the primary level&#13;
does not appear to be high, one person in the family may have to go without food for 8 days&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   31&#13;
&amp;#12;to pay for the schooling costs of one child. At the secondary level, one person will have to&#13;
go without food for 28 days to pay for the schooling cost of one child. For poor families,&#13;
particularly those in rural areas living on subsistence agriculture, an added difficulty is the&#13;
need to produce the cash on time to pay for these expenses.&#13;

105.     Poor families report that the major problems that students experience in school are&#13;
a lack of school materials (26 percent) and a lack of uniforms (20 percent) (Table 2.7). One&#13;
in four poor children also complains about the lack of physical facilities or the poor state of&#13;
schools. In urban areas, only 12 percent of students report problems with the physical&#13;
facilities compared to 24 percent in rural areas.&#13;

&amp;#12;106.         Low School Achievement. Mozambique participates in the regional student&#13;
achievement test conducted by the SACMEQ consortium.56 The test is administered to&#13;
students in grade 6 in reading and mathematics. Table 2.8 compares the performance of&#13;
Mozambican students with the average obtained by students in other SACMEQ countries.&#13;
As can be seen, their scores declined in both reading and mathematics between 2000 and&#13;
2007 and were below the average for the SACMEQ countries.&#13;

107.         This poor student performance is the result of a number of circumstances including&#13;
environmental factors and school conditions. The sharp increase in primary school&#13;
enrollments in recent years contributed to a high pupil-teacher ratio in public schools, with&#13;
an average of 58.4 pupils per teacher at the primary level (Table 2.9). Teacher training also&#13;
presents challenges. UNESCO reports that only about three-quarters of all teachers in&#13;
Mozambique at the primary and secondary levels are trained.&#13;

  The Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) Consortium&#13;
consists of 15 Ministries of Education in Southern and Eastern Africa: Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,&#13;
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, the Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia,&#13;
Zanzibar, and Zimbabwe.&#13;
&#13;

                                                            33&#13;
&amp;#12;108.     Access to textbooks has also been a challenge. Between 2000 and 2007, the&#13;
proportion of sixth graders without textbooks increased from 6.3 percent to 8.2 percent,&#13;
and students who had to share two books from 20.3 percent to 24.9 percent. Sixth graders&#13;
who had exclusive access to a textbook went down to 52.8 percent from 53.2 percent&#13;
during the same period.57 The Ministry of Education with the support of the Education&#13;
Support Fund (FASE) has been making a substantial investment in textbooks and has been&#13;
distributing between 12 million to 14 million books annually to primary schools (grades 1-7)&#13;
(see Chapter III below).58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
109.     Vulnerable Children and Teens. In Mozambique 42 percent of children aged 0 to 17&#13;
do not live with both of their parents and 14.6 percent do not live with their biological&#13;
parents. This is one of the consequences of the AIDS epidemic. A large proportion of&#13;
children, 17.1 percent or 2,061,866 (1,035,090 boys and 1,026,776 girls) are orphaned and&#13;
vulnerable (OVC) due to AIDS.59 Children who have lost one or both parents comprise 12.2&#13;
percent of the 0 to 17 cohort, a total of 1,447,053 orphans (717,982 boys and 729,071 girls).&#13;
There is not much gender difference among OVC - 17.3 percent are boys and 16.9 percent&#13;
girls. The prevalence of OVC is higher in urban areas (19.6 percent) than in rural areas (16&#13;
percent). The differences among provinces are larger, however, with a high of 30.7 percent&#13;
in Gaza and a low of 8.7 percent in Nissan. Children who have lost their parents to AIDS are&#13;
often subject to neglect, abuse, stigma, and discrimination as well as facing other risks that&#13;
affect poor children such as under-nutrition, low school attendance, and child labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
110.     Three percent of children aged 10 to 14 years have lost both parents to AIDS (double&#13;
orphans). Of these, 77 percent are currently attending school. This can be compared with&#13;

children have experienced the death of either parent, if either parent is chronically ill, or if an adult (aged 18 â&#128;&#147;&#13;
59) in the household has died (after being chronically ill) or was chronically ill in the year prior to the survey&#13;
(MICS 2008, p. 128).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;the 87 percent of children of the same age group who are not orphans and who live with at&#13;
least one parent who are attending school. Data by household wealth quintile indicates that&#13;
the poorest double orphans have lower school attendance than those in the higher quintiles&#13;
and also lower attendance than all other children who are living with at least one parent. In&#13;
the same cohort (10 to 14 years old), 24.6 percent are orphaned or vulnerable due to AIDS.&#13;
This group has an 82 percent school attendance rate compared to 85 percent for children&#13;
who are neither orphaned nor vulnerable. Once again, the attendance rate is higher for&#13;
children in wealthier households (Figure 2.6).&#13;

111.   Child Labor. Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s Child Protection Act of 2008 bans child labor and any&#13;
kind of work for children under 15 years of age, and the Labor Law states that employers&#13;
cannot employ children aged 15 to 18 years in risky tasks. The Labor Law also states that the&#13;
normal working period for a minor should not exceed 38 hours a week and 7 hours a day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
112.   The following information on child labor comes from the MICS survey. A child is&#13;
considered to be involved in child labor if, during the week prior to the survey, the following&#13;
occurred: (i) for children aged 5 to 11 years old, at least an hour of economic work or 28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  35&#13;
&amp;#12;hours of domestic work per week and (ii) for children aged 12 to 14 years old, at least 14&#13;
hours of economic work or 28 hours of domestic work per week. On this basis, 22 percent&#13;
or 1,381,036 children aged 5 to 14 years old in Mozambique are involved in child labor.&#13;
Most of them are involved in their familyâ&#128;&#153;s businesses (16 percent). A higher proportion of&#13;
girls (24 percent or 745,979) are involved in child labor than boys (21 percent or 635,057).&#13;
Girls are more frequently engaged in domestic tasks. On the other hand, similar proportions&#13;
of boys and girls are involved in work related to small-scale family businesses. In rural areas,&#13;
25 percent of children are engaged in child labor, compared with 15 percent in urban areas.&#13;
Lower proportions of children in the richest quintiles are engaged in child labor than those&#13;
in the poorest quintiles.60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
113.       Data from the IOF 2008/09 corroborates the MICS findings that child work is&#13;
widespread and that it mostly involves the poor. Figure 2.7 shows that 28.7 percent of&#13;
children aged 7 to 14 had worked in the week prior to the survey interview. This ranged&#13;
from 37 percent for the poorest families (Q1) to 9 percent for the richest (Q5). Child work is&#13;
more prevalent in rural areas (35 percent) than in urban areas (13 percent).&#13;

114.        Children with Disabilities. Nearly one in six children (13.5 percent) aged 2 to 9 has at&#13;
least one disability (6.2 million) in Mozambique. The difference between urban areas (15&#13;
percent) and rural areas (13 percent) is small. A serious delay in sitting, standing, or walking&#13;
is the disability that was most frequently reported. The other reported disabilities were not&#13;
understanding instructions, apparent hearing difficulties, not speaking and not making&#13;
themselves understood, and having seizures, going rigid, or losing consciousness.61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
115.        Sexual Exploitation of Children and Trafficking. The Law on the Trafficking of Persons&#13;
Especially Women and Children that was approved in 2008 makes trafficking a crime and&#13;
brings Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s legislation in line with international treaties. Nonetheless, major&#13;
challenges remain. According to the US Department of Stateâ&#128;&#153;s Trafficking in Persons Report&#13;
2010, â&#128;&#156;Mozambique is a source and, to a much lesser extent, a destination country for men,&#13;
women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced&#13;

to neighboring countries. According to the report:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
116.     â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦the Government of Mozambique does not fully comply with the minimum&#13;
standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.&#13;
Despite these efforts, including work on the development of implementing regulations for&#13;
its new anti-trafficking law, the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to&#13;
address human trafficking, particularly efforts to prosecute or convict trafficking offenders&#13;
as it has done in the past, or to investigate continuing reports of government officialsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
complicity in trafficking crimes.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&#13;
117.     The report places Mozambique on Tier 2 Watch List.63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
118.     Child Marriage and Teen Pregnancy. As the report accompanying the MICS 2008&#13;
data stresses, child marriage is a violation of human rights. â&#128;&#156;It compromises girlsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
development because it frequently results in early pregnancy and social isolation, little&#13;
education and poor vocational training, and thereby reinforces the incidence and nature of&#13;
poverty among women.â&#128;&#157;64 In Mozambique, marriage before the age of 16 is illegal.&#13;
However, the capacity to enforce the law is limited, and â&#128;&#156;traditional marriagesâ&#128;&#157; remain&#13;
common under customary law. The percentage of women aged 15 to 49 who married&#13;

Tier 2 countries whose governments do not fully comply with the TVPAâ&#128;&#153;s minimum standards, but are making&#13;
significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards. Tier 2 watch list countries whose&#13;
governments do not fully comply with the TVPAâ&#128;&#153;s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to&#13;
bring themselves into compliance with those standards, and: a) the absolute number of victims of severe&#13;
forms of trafficking is very significant or is significantly increasing; b) there is a failure to provide evidence of&#13;
increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year; or, c) the&#13;
determination that a country is making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with minimum&#13;
standards was based on commitments by the country to take additional future steps over the next year.&#13;
Tier 3 countries whose governments do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making&#13;

&amp;#12;before the age 15 of is 17.7 percent, with the proportion in rural areas (21.4 percent) being&#13;
higher than that in urban areas (11.2 percent). Nearly 40 percent of women aged 15 to 19&#13;
are already married or in a traditional union.65 And a similar percentage (41 percent) of girls&#13;
aged 15 to 19 have a child or are pregnant (DHS 2003). Pregnancies at an early age put both&#13;
the mother and the child at risk, often forcing poor young mothers to leave school in order&#13;
to work and maintain their children. It is also one of the major factors in the inter-&#13;
generational transmission of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
119.       In sum, while enrollments at primary school level have increased significantly in&#13;
recent years, Mozambique faces important challenges in improving the quality of education&#13;
that children are receiving. There are many orphans and vulnerable children as well as other&#13;
vulnerable groups such as child workers and abused and sexually exploited children who&#13;
should receive priority attention from the GOM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 3.        18-24 Years Old&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
120.       The principal risk facing young people is leaving school without enough skills to get a&#13;
good and stable job. Most young people with no skills remain jobless and some get in&#13;
trouble with the law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
121.       Vulnerable and Jobless Youth. School dropout rates at the primary level are very high&#13;
â&#128;&#146; 64 percent (63 percent for boys and 65 percent for girls),66 and attendance rates at the&#13;
secondary level are very low. Consequently, there are near 1 million children aged 13 to 17&#13;
years old who are not in school. Therefore, it is not surprising that a large proportion of&#13;
young people (those aged 18 to 24), who number 2.5 million, are illiterate. The illiteracy&#13;
rate for those aged 15 to 19 is 29.9 percent (21.9 percent for men and 37.1 percent for&#13;
women), and for those aged 20 to 24, it increases to 38.6 percent (22 percent for men and&#13;

&amp;#12;51.9 percent for women). Most of these youths are working with their families, working in&#13;
the informal market, or â&#128;&#156;doing nothing,â&#128;&#157; Though those with some qualifications might be&#13;
looking for their first job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
122.       There is no recent labor market information on youth unemployment or jobless&#13;
youth. In most countries, youth unemployment is much higher than overall unemployment,&#13;
as young people have difficulty in obtaining their first job. In South Africa, for instance, the&#13;
authorities indicated recently that between 40 to 50 percent of young people aged 17 to 25&#13;
were unemployed.67 In Mozambique, the Ministry of Labor reported in 2005 that, of all&#13;
those unemployed (desemprego registrado), 75 percent were looking for their first job,&#13;
while 25 percent were looking for a new job. In Maputo City, nearly one-half of the&#13;
unemployed were looking for their first job while the other half was looking for a new job,&#13;
while in Cabo Delgado, 85 percent were looking for their first job and 15 percent for a new&#13;
job.68 Overall unemployment was 19 percent, and the unemployment rate for the 15 to 19&#13;
year old cohort was 37 percent (Table 2.10). Overall unemployment for women was much&#13;
higher than for men, particularly in urban areas. However, all of these figures should be&#13;
interpreted in the light of an economy that has very high levels of informality and poverty.&#13;

126.       Young People in Conflict with the Law. Young people who are not working or&#13;
studying are not acquiring the skills to ensure their future economic autonomy and social&#13;
inclusion. Some of these youths occupy their time in illicit or criminal activities. Indeed,&#13;
according to the Ministry of Justice data, about one-third of the prison population is&#13;
comprised of people aged between 16 and 21.69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
127.       In sum, many young people who are out of school are illiterate and lack the skills&#13;
necessary to obtain good and stable jobs. These youths are working in the informal sector,&#13;
are still looking for their first job, are â&#128;&#156;doing nothing,â&#128;&#157; or are occupying their time in&#13;
criminal activities.&#13;

agricultural and informal sectors in very low-productivity activities where they cannot earn&#13;
enough to cover their basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
129.       Working Poor. As of 2010, Mozambique had a population of 22.4 million and an&#13;
economically active population (aged 15 years and older) of about 11 million (55 percent).70&#13;
Over 85 percent of the population aged 15 and older in the lowest quintile (Q1) who were&#13;
surveyed for the IOF 2008/09 had worked in the previous week (Table 2.14). Ten percent&#13;
did not work but reported that they had a job, and the remaining percent were not&#13;
available to work or were unemployed. In the richest quintiles, there was a lower&#13;
proportion of people with a job (58.5 percent) and higher proportion of people not available&#13;
to work or unemployed (36 percent). A similar contrast can be seen between urban and&#13;
rural areas, with rural areas having higher proportions of working people than urban areas.&#13;

131.    Most of the poorest workers (Q1) are self-employed and have no employees (54&#13;
percent) or are unpaid family workers (44 percent) (Figure 2.8). These are among the most&#13;
insecure, unstable occupations, often associated with the informal labor market. The richest&#13;
workers are mostly self-employed and employ other workers (35 percent), work for the&#13;
private sector (25 percent), or work for the government or the public sector (16 percent). In&#13;
urban areas, the majority of those who are working are self-employed have no workers&#13;
(percent) followed by unpaid family workers (21 percent), and workers in the private sector&#13;
(19 percent). In rural areas, the majority are self-employed with no workers followed by&#13;
unpaid family workers (43 percent).&#13;

132.       According to the informal sector survey conducted by the INE in 2004 (INFOR 2004),&#13;
threeâ&#128;&#147;quarters of the labor force in Mozambique worked in the informal sector, 8 percent&#13;
were employed in formal activities, and 17 were unemployed (Table 2.16). The formal&#13;
sector workers were concentrated in the urban areas (75 percent), while the informal sector&#13;
predominates in the rural areas (78 percent). In urban areas, half of the labor force was&#13;
engaged in informal sector activities, while in rural areas, 87 percent of the workers were&#13;
informal.71 In all provinces, more than half of the labor force was in informal activities, with&#13;
the exception of Maputo Province and Maputo City where only 27.4 percent and 49 percent&#13;
respectively were in the informal sector. 72&#13;

&amp;#12;133.     Of the total number of informal workers, 59 percent were women and 41 percent&#13;
were men.73 Approximately 91 percent of informal workers were in agriculture, 2 percent in&#13;
industry and construction, 5 percent in trade and tourism, and the remaining 2 percent in&#13;
other services.74 Nearly one-half of the informal sector workers were located in the Central&#13;
region (45.6 percent), one-third in the North, and the remaining 21 percent in the South.75&#13;
In the Central region, most informal activities were in agriculture (47 percent), while in the&#13;
South they were in trade and tourism (54.9 percent) and other services (57 percent) and in&#13;
the North they were in agriculture (35 percent) and industry and construction (29&#13;

134.     Lack of Human Capital. Low-paid jobs are often associated with low capital&#13;
endowments (both human and physical). Mozambique still has high illiteracy rates,&#13;
particularly among those in working age. For example, 48.1 percent of the population aged&#13;
15 years and over (or 5.9 million people) do not know how to read or write, and female&#13;

&amp;#12;illiteracy rates (62.7 percent) are twice that of males (31.4 percent). Figure 2.9 reveals a&#13;
relative peak for the 35-39 cohort which may be related to the children that missed school&#13;
because of the war. It also indicates that illiteracy is lower among younger cohorts, a result&#13;
of the recent advances in the education system. Nonetheless, about 30 percent of those in&#13;
the 15 to 19 age group cannot read or write.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
135.       Subsistence Farmers. Data from IOF 08/09 indicates that poverty in Mozambique&#13;
continues to be concentrated in rural areas, where two-thirds of the Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
population lives. Livelihoods in rural areas depend on agriculture, which is dominated by&#13;
low-input smallholder rain-fed farms that grow mostly food crops (such as maize and&#13;
cassava). According to the most recent agricultural survey (TIA 2008), there are 3.7 million&#13;
small farms, nearly one-quarter of which are managed by women. Poverty is concentrated&#13;
in some provinces in central Mozambique that are subject to periodic devastating droughts&#13;
and floods. As the majority of the poor in rural areas consists of subsistence farmers,&#13;
increasing agricultural productivity and access to markets are critical to boosting food&#13;
production and agricultural growth and to reducing rural poverty. 77&#13;

136.    Major constraints to sustaining agriculture productivity increases include low&#13;
adoption rates by Mozambique farmers of productivity-enhancing agricultural technologies&#13;
coupled with a lack of sufficient agricultural services and rural financial services. Only&#13;
around 3 percent of farmers countrywide have adopted irrigation, improved plant varieties,&#13;
fertilizer, and mechanization.78 In 2008, only 8.3 percent and 2.6 percent of farms received&#13;
the benefit of any extension services or credit respectively.79 Among the poorest farmers&#13;
(Q1), only 1.9 percent received any credit (Figure 2.10).80 Indeed, IOF 08/09 reveals that&#13;
only 3.3 percent of households in rural have a bank account compared with 36.3 percent in&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
137.    According to IOF 2008/09, of those who work (9.1 million), 46 percent are in the&#13;
lowest two quintiles (4.2 million) and are unlikely to make enough income to meet their&#13;
basic needs (Figure 2.11). Over 97 percent of these (in Q1 and Q2) are self-employed and&#13;

138.   In sum, of the 9.1 million Mozambicans that work, 4.2 million are likely to be poor.&#13;
The great majority of these work in the informal sector (self-employed with no workers or&#13;
as unpaid family workers) and in low-productivity agriculture activities, and many are&#13;
among the 5.9 million who are illiterate.&#13;

139.   The main risk for senior citizens is if they have no pension when they leave the labor&#13;
market and must depend on family, social assistance programs, or charity for their survival.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
140.   No Pension. Mozambique has three main social security plans. Two are offered by&#13;
the Ministry of Finance and Public Administration (MOF) to civil servants and the military,&#13;
and the third is managed by the National Institute of Social Security (INSS) for all private&#13;
sector employees. Both systems cover old age, accidents, and death. The MOF plans also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;offer health and funeral benefits and pensions for exceptional services to the state and for&#13;
those in the military who die in service (pensÃ£o de sangre), while the INSS has recently&#13;
introduce a maternity benefit.&#13;
&#13;

141.       The coverage of the pension system is quite low (Table 2.17). Together the MOF and&#13;
the INSS plans only cover 4 percent of the economic active population (EAP), about 5&#13;
percent of the occupied EAP, and 29 percent of the salaried EAP. The private sector&#13;
compliance rate with the INSS is low with only 43 percent of salaried workers in the private&#13;
sector contributing to the INSS plan.&#13;

pension in 2009, which meant that 88.2 percent or 900,000 elderly had no old age&#13;
pension.81 As expected, most of the seniors without a pension are in the poorest quintiles as&#13;

143.    In sum, a large number of poor elderly Mozambicans have no old age pension and&#13;
must depend on their families, service institutions, and the GOMâ&#128;&#153;s social assistance for their&#13;
survival.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      Household Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
144.    The major risks facing households are falling or being trapped into poverty, having&#13;
no access to quality health services and suffering from HIV/AIDS and other infectious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      51&#13;
&amp;#12;diseases, being disabled, being a victim of domestic violence or having suffered gender&#13;
discrimination, and lacking access to basic services. Households in Mozambique are also&#13;
exposed to recurrent natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145.      Poverty. Over one-half of all 22.4 million Mozambicans live in poverty. Life&#13;
expectancy at birth is only 48 years â&#128;&#146; 47 for males and 49 for females.82 As already&#13;
discussed, among the most vulnerable groups are children in poverty, the disabled, those&#13;
living with HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, and the elderly. Table 2.19 presents the&#13;
distribution of age groups by quintile. When comparing the distribution of those in the poor&#13;
quintiles and their representation in the overall population (two right-hand columns), it is&#13;
clear that the children 0- 5 years old are disproportionately represented among the two&#13;
poorest quintiles. Also the elderly are disproportionately represented in the poorest quintile&#13;
(Q1).&#13;

146.      Over one-quarter of all households (30 percent) are headed by women.83 Compared&#13;
to male heads of households, more female heads of households tend to be poor, have less&#13;
education, have higher dependency rates, and are â&#128;&#156;self-employedâ&#128;&#157; with no employees,&#13;
most of whom work in subsistence agriculture (Table 2.20). Many of these families are&#13;

147.   Lack of Access to Health Care. Poor Mozambicans suffer more from poor health but&#13;
seek care less often than richer people. Table 2.21 indicates that about 14 percent of&#13;
respondents had been ill in the two weeks prior to the survey interview â&#128;&#146; 15.1 percent of&#13;
people in the poorest quintile compared with 10.8 percent of the richest quintile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
148.   Since 1985, patients seeking care in public facilities have had to pay a flat rate fee&#13;
per prescription in rural areas and a cost-related price for drugs in urban areas. In practice,&#13;
public facilities run out of medicines and patients must purchase them from private sources.&#13;
By law, health services should be provided free of cost to the following groups: pregnant&#13;
women, mothers and their newborns, children under the age of 5, war veterans, blood&#13;
donors, disabled people unable to work, retired people and pensioners, domestic servants,&#13;
the unemployed, and people with no means of subsistence. Disease-specific fee exemptions&#13;
include tuberculosis, leprosy, trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), chronic psychological&#13;
disorders, and HIV/AIDS testing, counseling and treatment. However, a tracking survey&#13;
conducted in 2002 concluded that compliance with these provisions varied widely among&#13;
health facilities. Since 2007 consultation fees have been officially fixed at MT 0.5 to MT 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     53&#13;
&amp;#12;and drugs costs at MT 5 (MT 2.5 in some rural areas). 84 Data from IOF 2008/09 indicate that&#13;
families in the poorest quintile paid MT 2 on average for each visit to public facilities and&#13;
spent MT 14 for medicines during the preceding month. On the other hand, the poorest&#13;
families (in Q1) spent MT 67 on average for each visit to a traditional healer. It should be&#13;
noted that, during the preceding month, members of the poorest families made only three&#13;
times as many visits to public health facilities as to traditional healers.&#13;

149.        Of the 13.9 percent of people (15.1 percent of those in Q1) who got sick during the&#13;
two weeks previous to the survey interview, 34.7 percent did not visit a health facility (45.5&#13;
percent in Q1) (Table 2.21). Of these, about 30 percent mentioned that they did not visit a&#13;
facility because it was not necessary (21.8 percent for Q1), 37.5 percent because it was too&#13;
far away (47.8 percent in Q1), 9.6 percent because it was too expensive (10.1 percent in&#13;
Q1), 8 percent because of a lack of transportation (8.9 percent for in Q1), and 14.5 percent&#13;
because of other reasons (11.4 percent in Q1) (Figure 2.13).&#13;

&amp;#12;150.       Of those that got sick, two-thirds visited a health facility or healer (54.5 percent in&#13;
the poorest quintile and 85.5 percent in the richest quintile). The great majority of&#13;
Mozambicans have no health insurance. In the IOF 2008/09 data, there are only 6,000&#13;
families from the richest quintile who had health insurance. Therefore, the majority of&#13;
families use public health facilities when they are sick. Indeed, 80 percent of those who got&#13;
ill visited a health post or health center and another 13 percent a public hospital. Even&#13;
those in the richest quintile visit public facilities, 88.2 percent, with a large proportion of&#13;
them (29.7 percent) visiting public hospitals (Table 2.21).&#13;

151.       About two-thirds of those who visited health facilities reported that they did not&#13;
encounter any problems. Of the third who did report problems, nearly half (46 percent)&#13;
mentioned a â&#128;&#156;long waiting timeâ&#128;&#157;, 22 percent mentioned a lack of medicines, and 16 percent&#13;
mentioned â&#128;&#156;unsuccessful treatment.â&#128;&#157; While no respondents mentioned the direct cost of&#13;
health services as a major problem when visiting the facility, it is important to keep in mind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         55&#13;
&amp;#12;that many poor people who get sick do not seek care because of the long distance they&#13;
have to travel to get to the facilities, a lack of transportation, and because it is â&#128;&#156;too&#13;
expensive.â&#128;&#157; However, the survey also indicated that poor families are prepared to pay a&#13;
traditional healer several times as much as they must pay for a visit to a public facility.85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
152.     Therefore, the data from IOF 2008/09 seem to indicate that the overwhelming&#13;
problem in health comes from the supply side, though it is necessary to keep in mind that&#13;
for a poor family any charge is a burden and might prevent them from seeking care in a&#13;
timely manner. In rural areas, this is even more problematic for poor families because of the&#13;
transportation costs they need to incur to reach a health facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153.     Increasing HIV/AIDS and Other Infectious Diseases. Southern Africa has the highest&#13;
HIV prevalence rates in the world. While Mozambique is not on the top of the list, it still has&#13;
very high rates (Table 2.22).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to the 2009 National Survey on Prevalence, Behavioral Risks, and Information&#13;
about HIV and AIDS in Mozambique (INSIDA), 11.5 percent of Mozambicans aged 15 to 49&#13;
are HIV-positive (1.2 million). Higher HIV prevalence is found in urban areas (15.9 percent)&#13;
than in rural areas (9.2 percent). Overall, 13.1 percent of women and 9.2 percent of men&#13;
aged 15 to 49 are HIV-positive. HIV prevalence is higher among women than men in both&#13;
urban and rural areas; women have a prevalence rate of 18.4 percent in urban areas and of&#13;
10.7 percent in rural areas and men of 12.8 percent urban areas and of 7.2 percent in rural&#13;
areas. HIV prevalence for both men and women generally increases with age. Young women&#13;
(15-24 years) are at risk of sexual exploitation (as well as infection from older husbands); in&#13;
fact according to USAIDS, they have a prevalence rate much higher than young men (15-24&#13;
years), 8.5 percent compared to 2.8 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
85&#13;
  This finding needs to be analyzed in more detail and confirmed on the ground. It is possible that&#13;
transportation costs and availability and cost of medicines may also be at play here, with the traditional healer&#13;
being located closer to home and with medicines included in the cost of the visit.&#13;

154.       The 2009 round of INSIDA revealed that the dynamics of the HIV epidemic differ in&#13;
the three Mozambican regions. The Northern region has a considerably lower prevalence&#13;
rate than the rest of the country, with a stable trend, the Central region has a relatively&#13;
higher prevalence, with a slightly declining trend; and the Southern region has a relatively&#13;
greater prevalence, with a growing trend (Figure 2.14).86&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
155.       Other infectious diseases also pose important challenges to health authorities,&#13;
including tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and measles. The estimated annual incidence of all&#13;
forms of TB in Mozambique is 431 cases per 100,000, a rate above the average incidence of&#13;
356 cases per 100,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria accounts for approximately 44&#13;
percent of all outpatient consultations, 57 percent of inpatient admissions, and almost 30&#13;
percent of in-hospital deaths. Malaria is also a major problem affecting pregnant women in&#13;
rural areas and contributes to at least 30 percent of maternal deaths. During the last three&#13;
years, the number of measles cases reported each year has nearly doubled from 272 to 530.&#13;
To address this surge, health authorities have modified the national campaign strategy to&#13;

156.     Many of the poor who are HIV positive also suffer from TB. It is estimated that two-&#13;
thirds of all people diagnosed with TB are infected with HIV.88 For poor people who suffer&#13;
from these diseases and often from hunger, the situation is unbearable. As the WFP has put&#13;
it, â&#128;&#156;Many of Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s poorest are burdened with the combination of widespread food&#13;
and nutrition insecurity and infectious diseases, most importantly HIV and AIDS and&#13;
tuberculosis (TB). While HIV/AIDS, TB, and hunger are pernicious enough in their own right,&#13;
the combination creates a dangerous vicious cycle that hastens morbidity and mortality&#13;
among affected individuals and calls for a more complex, targeted and encompassing&#13;
approach.â&#128;&#157;89 As of December 2009, approximately 168,000 people were receiving&#13;

500,000 adults in need of ART treatment.90&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
157.     People with Disabilities. According to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2008 Poverty Assessment for&#13;
Mozambique, poorer households (Q1) tend to include a higher proportion of disabled&#13;
adults, which adds to their burden of dependency.91 While the prevalence of disability in all&#13;
households is estimated at 7 percent, households in the poorest quintile have a disability&#13;
prevalence of 10 percent compared with a prevalence of 5 percent for the households in&#13;
the richest quintile.92&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
158.     Mozambique has not yet signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of&#13;
People with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.93 The National Policy for People with&#13;
Disabilities gives the Ministry of Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Affairs and Social Welfare (MMAS) the&#13;
responsibility for guaranteeing social protection coverage to people with disabilities and&#13;
their families through measures that encourage their autonomy and integration into the&#13;
community. Poor people with disabilities are eligible for the PSA, a monthly unconditional&#13;
cash transfer program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
159.     Domestic Violence and Gender Discrimination. According to MICS 2008, in&#13;
Mozambique there is some acceptance of domestic violence. Some forms of violence are&#13;
rooted in gender inequalities. Over one-third of women (36 percent) aged 15 to 49 believe&#13;
that a husband has right to beat his wife/partner for at least one of five reasons - when the&#13;
woman leaves without saying goodbye to her husband, does not look after the children&#13;
properly, argues with her husband, refuses to have sex with her husband, or burns the food.&#13;
Acceptance of domestic violence is more common in rural areas (39 percent) than in urban&#13;
areas (31 percent).&#13;

&amp;#12;160.       Lack of Basic Services. During the last several years, the GOM has made significant&#13;
efforts to bring basic services to the population, but major challenges remain. Table 2.23&#13;
presents estimates of household access to improved sources of drinking water, improved&#13;
sanitation facilities, and electricity. There are still 57 percent of households that have no&#13;
access to improved water or 2,628,581 people (403,711 in urban areas and 2,292,490 in&#13;
rural areas). Meanwhile, 81 percent have no access to improved sanitation facilities or&#13;
3,721,517 people (706,829 in urban areas and 3,080,636 in rural areas), and 88 percent&#13;
have no access to electricity or 4,071,778 people (838,969 in urban areas and 3,232,809 in&#13;
rural areas).&#13;

161.       Natural Disasters and Climate Change. Mozambique ranks third among those African&#13;
countries most exposed to risks from multiple weather-related hazards because it suffers&#13;
from periodic droughts, cyclones, and floods. According a recent World Bank report, as&#13;
much as 58 percent of the population and more than 37 percent of GDP are at risk from two&#13;
or more hazards. Floods, epidemics, and cyclones are the most frequent disasters, although&#13;
droughts affect by far the largest number of people.94 Table 2.24 summarizes the frequency&#13;
and direct impact of the major natural disasters experienced in Mozambique since 1992.&#13;

162.         According to the World Bank report, climate change will increase extreme weather&#13;
patterns, based on observed trends and future scenarios. Critical sectors that will be at&#13;
increasing risk from climate change include agriculture, infrastructure, power, water and&#13;
sanitation, and health and nutrition. The impact of climate change over the next 40 years&#13;
could lead to a 2 to 4 percent decrease in the yields of Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s major crops.95&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
163.         In sum, one half of the Mozambique population is poor, with poverty particularly&#13;
affecting children 0- 5 years old and the elderly. Poverty incidence is also higher among&#13;
women heads of households, many of whom are involved in subsistence agriculture. The&#13;
poor tend to get ill more often and have more difficulty accessing health care, mostly due to&#13;
supply constraints. The HIV epidemic continues to devastate Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s households and&#13;
communities, and only about one-third of those in need are receiving ART. Other challenges&#13;
include meeting the needs of people with disabilities, reducing domestic violence,&#13;
extending access to basic services to the many households that still do not have them, and&#13;
minimizing the impact of recurrent natural disasters.&#13;

&amp;#12;         Chapter 3: Public Policies and Programs to Address the Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
164.   In this section, we briefly analyze the policies and programs implemented by the&#13;
Government of Mozambique to minimize the impact of the recent global crises, particularly&#13;
on the most vulnerable groups, and discuss how households have dealt with the crisis. We&#13;
then discuss in turn the various public programs that are being implemented to address the&#13;
risks and the vulnerabilities faced by each age group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s Response to the Global Economic Crises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
165.   In mid-2000s, the world experienced a major crisis that began with a sharp increase&#13;
in food and fuel prices and was followed in 2008 by the collapse of major financial&#13;
institutions, a sharp economic contraction, and increased unemployment worldwide.&#13;
Mozambique did not escape the adverse impact of the global crisis, even though its growth&#13;
rates remained high (Figure 3.1). As a result of the sharp rise in fuel and food prices and the&#13;
deterioration of terms of trade, GDP growth decelerated in 2008 and in 2009 as exports&#13;
dropped sharply but has since recovered. Inflation, after dropping in 2009 because of a&#13;
reduction in commodity prices and the introduction of fuel subsidies, it accelerated in 2010,&#13;
partly due to the nominal devaluation of the Mozambique currency, the Metical. In&#13;
addition, there was a significant reduction in external financing for the budget, including in&#13;
grant financing (Figure 3.2).&#13;

166.       While the financial crisis did not affect Mozambique as severely as other countries,&#13;
the food and fuel crises did. A joint GOM and World Bank study estimated that between&#13;
July 2006 and July 2008 the prices of gasoline and wheat increased by 53 percent and 108&#13;
percent respectively in Maputo and the price of rice more than tripled in Beira.96 The study&#13;
concluded that the adverse impact of the fuel and food price increases was greater in urban&#13;
centers than in rural areas.&#13;

167.       To minimize the adverse impact of the global crisis, in 2008 and 2009 the GOM took&#13;
a series of monetary and fiscal measures to stimulate economic growth and employment&#13;
creation. To support the fiscal accounts and the balance of payments, the government&#13;
asked the World Bank to increase the size of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC-6)&#13;

most vulnerable population:&#13;

       ï&#130;·   The coverage of the unconditional cash transfer program (PSA) was expanded from&#13;
           96,582 direct beneficiaries in 2006 to 143,455 in 2008 and to 217,683 in 2010 as the&#13;
           Netherlands and the UK began supporting the program.&#13;
&#13;

       ï&#130;·   The INSS minimum pension was increased by 12 percent in 2009 and another 11&#13;
           percent in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The minimum wage was increased by 14 percent in 2009, by 10 percent in 2010, and&#13;

&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   Reduce the import tariff on raw grains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   The Ministry of Agriculture launched the Agricultural Production Action Plan (Plano&#13;
         de AcÃ§Ã£o da ProduÃ§Ã£o AgrÃ­cola, PAPA) which provides, among other things,&#13;
         subsidized agricultural inputs to small-scale farmers (in kind or through vouchers).&#13;
         The program is supported by the UNâ&#128;&#153;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and&#13;
         the European Union (EU).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Food- for-work programs were launched with the support of the WFP particularly to&#13;
         support the most food-insecure families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
169.     However, the GOM committed to eliminating the fuel subsidies, and in 2010 the&#13;
pump price of gasoline increased on several occasions.99 To compensate for the elimination&#13;
of the fuel subsidies, the GOM is in the process of making operational a set of measures, at&#13;
the core of which is the ENSSB and the urban poverty reduction strategy.&#13;

2.       Householdsâ&#128;&#153; Responses to the Crises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
170.     According to data from the IOF 2008/09, from the perspective of households, the&#13;
most important shock that occurred in the last three years was an increase in food prices&#13;
(reported by 36.5 percent of the households). This was followed by drought (19.8 percent)&#13;
and some idiosyncratic shocks such as the death of another household member (10.8&#13;
percent) or illness (8.1 percent) (Table 3.1). The increase in food prices affected urban&#13;
households more than those in rural areas, probably because some households in rural&#13;
areas are net producers of food. The poorest households were affected more than richer&#13;
households by agricultural pests, drought, cyclones, floods, and low producer prices.&#13;
&#13;
98&#13;
   There are about 11 minimum wages depending on occupation; for agriculture is 1682 MT and for financial&#13;
services 3,483, with an average of about MT 2,350 in 2010.&#13;

171.   A Poverty and Vulnerability Survey (PVS) conducted by the World Bank in 2006&#13;
found that the most common coping strategy in both urban and rural areas, with little&#13;
variation across income groups, is to seek help from family and friends. Selling household&#13;
goods and assets was more common in rural areas than in urban areas, despite rural&#13;
households generally having fewer assets. Households in rural areas were also much more&#13;
likely to do nothing and merely try to get by. In rural areas, coping usually includes daily&#13;
casual labor. Urban dwellers also resort to casual labor, usually loading and carrying goods&#13;
in markets. Other coping options in urban areas include selling assets or pawning them,&#13;
reducing food consumption, or borrowing or begging for money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
172.   The proximity of extended families and a householdâ&#128;&#153;s close ties with them, good&#13;
relations with neighbors and friends, and access to social, economic, and political elites&#13;
were seen as crucial for a householdâ&#128;&#153;s ability to weather shocks and risks. Such networks&#13;
can give household access to financial assistance (such as remittances), material support,&#13;
assets, and livelihood opportunities outside the household and the community. According&#13;
to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2008 Poverty Study, these social networks are based on th e capacity to&#13;
reciprocate, something that many of the poorest lack, thus leaving them with few means to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       66&#13;
&amp;#12;cope.100 Nonetheless, these informal coping mechanisms (social capital) must be taken into&#13;
account when designing social protection interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
173.       Table 3.2 details household coping strategies during the recent shocks. When faced&#13;
with food price increases, 25 percent of the households (23 percent in Q1) reduced their&#13;
food intake, 15 percent (17 percent in Q1) lowered the quality of their food, 13 percent (12&#13;
percent in Q1) cut their non-food expenditures, and 43 percent (45 percent in Q1) did&#13;
nothing. For other covariate shocks (such as drought, agricultural pests, and floods), the&#13;
main coping strategy was in general to reduce the amount of food consumed and this&#13;
applied to all quintiles. In the case of cyclones and floods, 10 percent and 14 percent of&#13;
households respectively mentioned that they had received help from the government. For&#13;
idiosyncratic shocks (the death or illness of a household member or the death of the head&#13;
of the household), households used a combination of coping strategies, with the majority&#13;
doing nothing. Some support from the government was mentioned by those in the poorest&#13;
quintiles in the case of an accident to or illness of a household member.&#13;

174.   In sum, Mozambique did not escape the adverse impact of the global crisis,&#13;
experiencing a decline in foreign aid to the budget and a sharp increase in food and fuel&#13;
prices. While the government attempted to protect the most vulnerable population from&#13;
the price hikes by increasing transfers, the minimum wage, and pensions, in the end they&#13;
were forced to implement untargeted fuel and other subsidies that had a high fiscal cost.&#13;
Householdsâ&#128;&#153; coping strategies included reducing the amount of food that they consumed&#13;
and the quality of food that they purchased and cutting back on their non-food expenses.&#13;

B.     Public Programs to Address Risks and Vulnerabilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
175.   The main public programs being executed to address the risks and vulnerabilities&#13;
identified are discussed below. While most of the programs covered here are being&#13;
implemented by public agencies, many of these programs count with the cooperation of the&#13;
partners and civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              69&#13;
&amp;#12;1.      Programs for 0 to 5 Year Olds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
176.    The Ministry of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s Child Health and Nutrition Program (SaÃºde e NutriÃ§Ã£o da&#13;
CrianÃ§a) is the main program for this age group. It is supported by UNICEF and several&#13;
NGOs. The program cost MT 248.8 million in 2010 and comprises micronutrients,&#13;
deworming, and nutrition rehabilitation interventions.101 In addition, programs for this age&#13;
group include kindergartens for abandoned and orphaned children run by INAS, pre-schools&#13;
run by the MMSA, and the National Birth Registration Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
177.    Micro-nutrient Supplementation with Vitamin A (Micronutrientes Vitamina A) â&#128;&#146;&#13;
Ministry of Health/UNICEF/Helen Keller International. The aim of this program is to reduce&#13;
infant mortality by reducing the incidence of diarrhea, measles, and upper respiratory tract&#13;
infections. The target groups for the Vitamin A supplementation program are children aged&#13;
between 6 months to 59 months (16.4 percent of the total population) and pregnant&#13;
women. Supplementation is provided through health clinics (well child clinics or ante natal&#13;
clinics) and during Child Health Week.102 Children receive supplementation every six&#13;
months, and pregnant women receive one dose during their pregnancy. In 2010&#13;
approximately 4 million children between the ages of 6 and 59 months received&#13;
supplementation (achieving the targets set by the Ministry of Health) and 1.2 million&#13;
pregnant women (also achieving the target set by the health authorities). UNICEF has&#13;
estimated the annual cost of supplementation per child to be US$1.2.103 In 2011 the&#13;
Ministry of Health is implementing the program with support from UNICEF and Helen Keller&#13;
International (HKI).&#13;

    Child Health Week is coordinated by the Ministry of Health and is a nationwide campaign to mobilize the&#13;
population to make use of all primary health services, including antenatal care, vaccinations, and&#13;
micronutrient supplementation. The campaign takes these services into communities and encourages them to&#13;
make greater use of health facilities. Child Health Week campaigns are held twice a year.&#13;

&amp;#12;178.          Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (Ferro/acido fÃ³lico) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of&#13;
Health/UNICEF. This program is managed by the Ministry of Health with support from&#13;
UNICEF. It aims to reduce maternal mortality, improve neo-natal outcomes, and reduce&#13;
anemia in pregnant women and adolescent girls aged between 15 and 19 years old. Data&#13;
from the 2010 Nutrition Department Annual Report indicate that 1.4 million girls and young&#13;
women were reached through the antenatal clinics and during Child Health Weeks. 104&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
179.          De-worming Program (DesparasitaÃ§Ã£o) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Health/UNICEF/SC/HKI. The de-&#13;
worming program targets children between the ages of 12 months and 59 months and&#13;
pregnant women. The program is managed by the Ministry of Health and supported by&#13;
UNICEF, Save the Children (SC), and HKI. The aim of the program is to reduce child and&#13;
maternal mortality by reducing the severity of anemia and diarrhea in children and&#13;
pregnant women. The children are reached through the health clinics and the women&#13;
through antenatal clinics. In addition, de-worming is offered to both children and pregnant&#13;
women during Child Health Week campaigns. In 2010 approximately 1.5 million children&#13;
were reached through the regular health clinics and more than double, 3.5 million, through&#13;
the Child Health Weeks, making a total of 5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
180.          Nutrition Rehabilitation Program. (Programa Nacional de ReabilitaÃ§Ã£o Nutricional) â&#128;&#146;&#13;
Ministry of Health/SC/UNICEF. The Ministry of Health runs a comprehensive nutrition&#13;
rehabilitation program for children and adults who are severely malnourished. It consists of&#13;
two components. The first is facility-based treatment for complex cases of severe acute&#13;
malnutrition (SAM) where patients are treated with high-energy protein formulas and&#13;
infection control. Treatment is carried out in all health facilities that have the capacity to&#13;
admit patients. The rehabilitation products are supplied by UNICEF through the Ministry of&#13;
Healthâ&#128;&#153;s distribution system. The second component is community-based management&#13;
(CMAM) in which cases of less complicated SAM are given ready to use therapeutic foods&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;(RUTF) to treat their severe under-nutrition at home. The community-based management&#13;
of SAM is still not available in all provinces and is currently being piloted by Save the&#13;
Children/UNICEF and the Ministry of Health. In 2010 the program treated 84,309 outpatient&#13;
children with moderate and acute malnutrition and 13,806 inpatient children with acute&#13;
malnutrition. The WFP is proposing (from 2011) to provide take-home dry rations of Corn&#13;
Soya Blend + (CSB+) for malnourished pregnant and lactating women, children (aged 6&#13;
months to 15 years) and people living with HIV and/or TB. The WFP program will be rolled&#13;
out in seven provinces in the country.105&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
181.    Social Units for Young Children (Unidades Sociais â&#128;&#147;InfantÃ¡rios) â&#128;&#146; INAS). Social service&#13;
institutions house people who are living in absolute poverty and have been abandoned or&#13;
marginalized. These include orphanages, homes for the elderly, and transit centers for the&#13;
disabled. INAS manages a number of these institutions, but there are also social service&#13;
institutions that are managed by religious or charitable organizations. The MMAS has&#13;
oversight of all of these institutions and provides them with minimum assistance. In 2010&#13;
INAS directly managed eight nurseries catering to 574 children. It is estimated that the cost&#13;
of running these centers was MT 6.1 million in 2010.106&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
182.    Kinders (Centros Infantis e Escolinhas) â&#128;&#146; MMAS. There are 663 community pre-&#13;
schools (escolinhas) and 197 children centers (15 of them in the public sector) that together&#13;
catered to 69,312 children (1,869 children in public centers) in 2010. As already mentioned,&#13;
net pre-primary enrollment is only between 4 to 5 percent. The Ministry of Education is fully&#13;
aware of the importance of ECD and pre-primary education and is developing an integrated&#13;
strategy for this education level with the support of the World Bank.&#13;

&amp;#12;183.   National Registration Plan (Plano Nacional de Registro de Nascimento) â&#128;&#146; DNRN/&#13;
Ministry of Justice/UNICEF/Government of Netherlands. This plan was launched in 2005 and&#13;
is being implemented by the Ministry of Justiceâ&#128;&#153;s National Directorate of National&#13;
Registration with the support of UNICEF and the Dutch Government. In 2010, registration&#13;
campaigns were carried out in 42 rural districts, while routine registration systems were&#13;
strengthened in 76 rural districts. Media spots were produced to promote awareness of the&#13;
need for birth registration. The program has registered 699,622 children and invested MT&#13;
24.2 million in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.     Programs for 6-17 Year Olds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
184.   For this age group, there are several programs that give support directly to schools&#13;
as well as programs for orphans and vulnerable children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
185.   Direct Support to Schools (Apoio Directo a Escolas). This program, which was&#13;
initiated in 2003, is managed by the Ministry of Educationâ&#128;&#153;s Special Programs Directorate. It&#13;
provides direct financing to schools, in part to compensate them for the elimination of&#13;
primary schools fees. The formula to assign the resources is not fixed and aims to favor&#13;
schools in poorest areas and in more need of support. Generally it provides schools with&#13;
US$5 to US$6 per class (turma) plus US$1 to US$3 per student per year. It seeks also to&#13;
provide a minimum of resources (floor) to each school. The allocations are made twice a&#13;
year so that enrollment and schoolsâ&#128;&#153; needs can be checked. In 2010 the program provided&#13;
MT 549 million to primary schools, MT 210 during the first allocation and MT 339 million&#13;
during the second allocation, and benefitted 5.2 million primary school children. In addition,&#13;
the program is also providing some direct support to secondary schools and to technical&#13;
education, which in 2010 reached MT 59 million, for a total program investment of MT 608&#13;
million. The program is mostly financed by the Education Sector Support Fund (FASE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             73&#13;
&amp;#12;186.    School Books (Livro Escolar). This program provides the required books free of cost&#13;
to all students in primary schools (grades 1-7). For students in grades 1 and 2, it provides all&#13;
required books every year since they are exercise books, and for students in grades 3-7, it&#13;
provides the required textbooks. The schools receive 100 percent of the required exercise&#13;
books for grades 1 and 2 and one-third of the required books for all other grades as books&#13;
are assumed to last three years. In 2010, the program distributed 14.2 million books (82&#13;
titles) and 162,500 teacher manuals at a cost of MT 680 million. To lower the cost of the&#13;
program, the GOM has bought the rights to eight titles and is in the process of acquiring the&#13;
rights to another 20 titles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
187.    School Feeding (AlimentaÃ§Ã£o Escolar) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Education/WFP. This program&#13;
provides school feeding to students attending boarding schools (Lares de Estudantes e&#13;
Internatos) run by the Ministry of Education as well as to a few number of primary schools.&#13;
The GOM finances the boarding schools from its own resources and the WFP provides in-&#13;
kind supplies for the primary school feeding program. In 2010 the program covered 421,034&#13;
children (8 percent of the 5,189,601children in primary school) in 841 primary schools (5&#13;
percent of the 13,434 existing public primary schools) at a cost of MT 300 million. 107&#13;
According to the Ministry of Education, the schools are selected on the basis of the&#13;
Secretariat for Food Security and Nutritionâ&#128;&#152;s nutrition and food vulnerability mapping. The&#13;
Ministry of Education is currently developing a national school lunch program ( Programa&#13;
Nacional de Lanche Escolar) with World Bank support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
188.    Child-friendly Schools (Escolas Amigas das CrianÃ§as) Ministry of Education/UNICEF.&#13;
This program is implemented by the GOM with the support of UNICEF and provides safe&#13;
water and adequate sanitation facilities to all schools in the targeted districts, among other&#13;
interventions. The introduction of community-led total sanitation (CLTS) in schools and the&#13;
training of key implementing non-governmental organizations and governmental staff has&#13;
&#13;
107&#13;
   Data on total number of schools and students are from Ministry of Education (2010b). Support from WFP&#13;
reported by Ministry of Finance (2010) (Table V-4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                   74&#13;
&amp;#12;led to an improvement of sanitation in schools. UNICEFâ&#128;&#153;s Child-friendly Schools Annual Field&#13;
Assessment Report shows that considerable progress has been made in terms of increasing&#13;
enrollment and retention rates and improving the educational performance of children in&#13;
the five school districts where the program has been implemented (Maganja da Costa, Buzi,&#13;
Mossurize, Changara, and Chibuto).108 According to UNICEF, the program reached 370,000&#13;
children with an investment of MT 127 million in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
189.       National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (Plano de AcÃ§Ã£o&#13;
Nacional para as CrianÃ§as Ã&#147;rfÃ£s e VulnerÃ¡veis) â&#128;&#147; MMAS. The Plan of Action on Orphans and&#13;
Vulnerable Children (PACOV) under the auspices of the Ministry for Women and Social&#13;
Action (MMAS) was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2006. The first PACOV covered&#13;
the period 2006 to 2010. UNICEF contributed MT 40.3 million in food aid to the program,&#13;
which reached 252,258 children in 2010. PACOV II has been prepared on the basis of a 2010&#13;
evaluation of the implementation of PACOV. The central premise of PACOV is that the&#13;
needs of the orphaned and vulnerable children are interdependent, and therefore, a variety&#13;
of coordinated interventions are required in order to make a significant difference to these&#13;
childrenâ&#128;&#153;s lives. The Action Plan identified six areas as fundamental: (i) health; (ii) education;&#13;
(iii) nutritional and food support; (iv) financial support; (v) legal support; and (vi) psycho-&#13;
social support (Figure 3.3). The GOM has determined that at least three of these basic&#13;
needs must be satisfied by any given program or project aiming at supporting orphaned and&#13;
vulnerable children. The GOM recognizes that a number of state and non-state actors are&#13;
needed to fulfill the needs of vulnerable children. The evaluation of PACOV drew attention&#13;
to the lack of resources for coordination and monitoring of the Action Plan by the MMAS,&#13;
especially in regard to the interventions of the non-state actors. In addition, the lack of clear&#13;
budgeting and monitoring of the financial resources allocated to the Plan of Action makes it&#13;
difficult to track social expenditure for orphans and vulnerable children. These issues are&#13;

190.       U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has been&#13;
providing funding in Mozambique for HIV and AIDS programs since 2006. The implementing&#13;
partners of PEPFAR programs are American NGOs based in Mozambique.109 PEPFAR&#13;
provides funding for several different aspects of the fight against AIDs. The first aspect is&#13;
prevention, including programs that (i) prevent mother-to-child transmission; (ii) promote&#13;
abstinence, faithfulness, and the delay of sexual experience; (iii) specifically target high-risk&#13;
or high-transmitter groups with condoms and other prevention measures; and (iv) ensure&#13;
blood, biomedical, and injection safety. The second aspect is care, including (i) mobilizing&#13;
and supporting local responses; (ii) standardizing essential services for orphans and&#13;
vulnerable children; and (iii) strengthening the enabling environment and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
109&#13;
      These partners may work with government services or directly with community-based organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       76&#13;
&amp;#12;response. The third aspect is treatment, including (i) technical assistance and training to&#13;
strengthen pharmaceutical logistics information and control systems to ensure a reliable&#13;
supply of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and (ii) the procurement of ARV drugs approved by the&#13;
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is reported that PEPFAR is supporting about one-&#13;
quarter of a million children, but no cost estimates are available.110&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
191.       Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children Program (Apoio aos Ã&#147;rfÃ£os e CrianÃ§as&#13;
VulnerÃ¡veis) â&#128;&#146; MMAS/ PMA. In 2006, the MMAS and the WFP signed a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding that formalized their cooperation in terms of programming for orphans and&#13;
vulnerable children. The WFP provides food assistance to OVC under the umbrella of this&#13;
agreement, which is delivered by partners (usually NGOs and community-based&#13;
organizations). The Orphans and Vulnerable Children Program is implemented in the&#13;
provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Sofala, and Tete. Children eligible for the&#13;
program need to be 0 to 18 years of age and living in poor households. The program gives&#13;
priority to child heads of vulnerable households and women heads of households. The&#13;
majority of children in the program are affected by HIV and AIDS. According to the WFP,&#13;
48,937 children benefitted from the program in 2010 (44,294 children through the&#13;
community programs and 4,643 children in institutions) at a cost of MT 315 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
192.       Prevention and Combat of HIV/AIDS (PrevenÃ§Ã£o e Combate do HIV/SIDA) â&#128;&#146; Ministry&#13;
of Education. This program, which is financed through the Education Support Fund (FASE),&#13;
supports the implementation of the Sectoral Plan for HIV/AIDS-Sector of Education, which is&#13;
part of the National Strategic Plan to Combat HIV/AIDS of the National Council to Combat&#13;
AIDS (CNCS). It supports research that can lead to quality improvements and innovation in&#13;
the prevention and combat of AIDS and the training of teachers and education managers to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
193.     Children with Disabilities (CrianÃ§as com DeficiÃªncia). The Law on Promoting and&#13;
Protecting the Rights of the Child states that children with disabilities have the right to&#13;
special or specialized education at school and to specialized care in the national health&#13;
system. Health units and public and private establishments are obliged to provide special&#13;
care, medical treatment, and rehabilitation for children with disabilities. The National Policy&#13;
for People with Disabilities gives the MMAS the responsibility to promote effective&#13;
integration of children with disabilities in preschool activities. In 2010, the MMAS supported&#13;
2,384 children with disabilities; in addition, 309 students were enrolled in its three special&#13;
schools and 89 were enrolled in the Institute for the Visually Impaired.112&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
194.     Special Education (EducaÃ§Ã£o Especial). The National Education Policy envisages the&#13;
possibility of children with slight disabilities attending normal schools and of children with&#13;
serious disabilities attending special schools. This requires that the education services must&#13;
identify children with special needs before they start their school career and promote the&#13;
training of teachers to work with these children. The obligation of the national education&#13;
system to guarantee educational opportunities for all people with disabilities is restated in&#13;
the Policy for People with Disabilities. As per the Ministry of Educationâ&#128;&#153;s National Strategic&#13;
Plan, special education is provided within regular schools. In 2010, there were about 74,000&#13;
children with special needs attending regular schools. In that year, the Ministry of Education&#13;
trained 400 teachers in special education and 96 school staff in inclusive education. It also&#13;
concluded the Regional Resources Centers for Special Education of Gaza, Nampula, and&#13;
Tete.113&#13;

Zero de PrevenÃ§Ã£o de ViolÃªncia Contra as CrianÃ§as) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Education/Ministry of the&#13;
Interior/MMAS/UNICEF/SC). The campaign is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Education,&#13;
the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs and is&#13;
implemented with the support of partners and NGOs. Two programs were implemented in&#13;
2010 as part of this campaign: Prevention and Response to Violence Against Children&#13;
(PrevenÃ§Ã£o e Resposta a ViolÃªncia Contra as CrianÃ§as) with the support of UNICEF at a cost&#13;
of MT 9.1 million and the Prevention Of Child Trafficking (PrevenÃ§Ã£o do Trafico de CrianÃ§as)&#13;
with the support of Save the Children at a cost of MT 900,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.     Programs for 18 to 24 Year Olds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
196.   For this age group, there are scholarship programs and youth programs run by the&#13;
Ministry of Youth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
197.   Institute for Study Grants (Instituto de Bolsas de Estudo) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Education.&#13;
This Institute was created in 2007 and began operating in 2008. The purpose was to unify&#13;
under one roof the management of scholarships that were dispersed by many different&#13;
government institutions. A scholarship regulation was developed, approved, and published.&#13;
The Institute (IBE) is a financially autonomous institution under the Ministry of Education.&#13;
The IBE grants scholarships based on â&#128;&#156;needâ&#128;&#157; and academic performance. The awarding of&#13;
the scholarship is decentralized to the provincial commissions. Every year the scholarships&#13;
are advertised in the major news media. Candidates then apply, and the provincial&#13;
commissions select a number of beneficiaries that depends on the amount of resources&#13;
available. In 2010, IBE had 1,200 beneficiaries studying within the country and 1,000&#13;
studying abroad with the financial support of development partners. Scholarships are for&#13;
four to five years depending on the courses of study in question, and the amount covers&#13;
tuition and living expenses (about MT 3,000 per month for 12 months of living expenses). Of&#13;
the beneficiaries studying in Mozambique, about 60 percent were studying in public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              79&#13;
&amp;#12;universities (where tuition is about MT 5,000 per month) and 40 percent in private&#13;
institutions (where tuition is about MT 13,600 per month). Of the 1,200 internal&#13;
scholarships, only 25 were for poor students in secondary school as scholarships at this level&#13;
are awarded only in very special circumstances. In 2010, the IBE invested MT 180.9 million&#13;
in scholarships. The IBE is now considering developing a student loan program, while the&#13;
Ministry of Education is currently discussing the introduction of a program of study grants&#13;
for children attending classes above 7th grade. The objective would be to retain children&#13;
from the poorest households in school.114&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
198.        Other Scholarships (Outras Bolsas de Estudo). Other institutions continue to offer&#13;
scholarships outside the IBE. Some are in specialized fields such in tourism or science and&#13;
technology while others are of general interest. The amount invested in these scholarships&#13;
in 2010 was MT 303.3 million.115&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
199.        Youth Initiative Fund (Fundo de Iniciativas Juvenis). In the area of youth, the Ministry&#13;
of Youth and Sports (MJD) has prioritized the strengthening of the youth association&#13;
movement and the development of programs for the generation of employment and self-&#13;
employment. Specific activities undertaken by the MJD include the dissemination of the&#13;
Cheringoma Declaration (which emanated from the second youth conference held on&#13;
October 2008 in the district of Sofala) and the beginning of a review of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s Youth&#13;
Policy and Strategy. The Youth Initiative Fund is a microcredit program that aims to develop&#13;
entrepreneurship skills and creation of capabilities among young people aged 15 to 35 to&#13;
enable them to generate self-employment opportunities mainly in the areas of agriculture,&#13;
food processing, and commerce and garment manufacturing. It is a demand-driven credit&#13;
program with youths receiving training and support in implementing their business plans.&#13;
The Fund is managed at the provincial level. Between 2006 and 2010 it supported 139&#13;

&amp;#12;projects in the provinces of Cabo Delgado (1), Niassa (2), Nampula (32), ZambÃ©zia (19), Tete&#13;
(5), Manica (3), Sofala (5), Inhambane (7), Gaza (1), Maputo ProvÃ­ncia (33), and Cidade de&#13;
Maputo (31) at a cost of MT 7 million. The program is fragmented, and cost recovery is&#13;
believed to be quite low. In Maputo, the Ministry is partnering with the General Union of&#13;
Cooperatives (Union Geral de Cooperativas) to manage the program under the auspices of&#13;
the UK Commonwealth Youth Program to improve results and increase cost recovery. The&#13;
MJD is seeking US$15 million to finance the program over the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
200.       The Busy Generation Program (GeraÃ§Ã£o Biz Program) â&#128;&#146; MJD/Ministry of&#13;
Education/Ministry of Health/UNFPA The program was designed and developed by young&#13;
people, who named it to reflect their â&#128;&#156;busy generation.â&#128;&#157; It aims to increase the awareness&#13;
of young people both in and out of school of sexual and reproductive health issues and to&#13;
encourage the adoption of safe, responsible, and gender-sensitive sexual and reproductive&#13;
behavior. The project is implemented by the provincial directorates of the Ministries of&#13;
Youth and Sports, Health, and Education, with the support of youth associations, NGOs, the&#13;
UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Pathfinder International, the Embassy of Norway, the&#13;
Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and the Danish International&#13;
Development Agency.116 In 2010, the program reached 54,000 young people in school and&#13;
out of school and invested MT 8.3 million.117&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.         Programs for 25 to 59 Year Olds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
201.       There are several programs aimed at increasing the literacy and skills of&#13;
Mozambicans in this age group and at helping the poor to obtain better jobs or to establish&#13;
a small business.&#13;

&amp;#12;202.       Income Generation Program (GeraÃ§Ã£o de Rendimento) â&#128;&#146; INAS. INASâ&#128;&#153;s Income&#13;
Generation Program (PGR), which dates from 1998, creates mechanisms to provide training&#13;
and micro-credit to individuals or groups that have the ability to participate in income-&#13;
generating activities or self-employment. Socioeconomic criteria are used to select the&#13;
beneficiaries in local communities. In 2010, 12,072 people (8,356 of whom were women)&#13;
benefitted from the program at a cost of MT 39.5 million. The program has a very low cost&#13;
recovery record and its impact is unknown. 118&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
203.       Social Benefit for Work (Beneficio Social pelo Trabalho) â&#128;&#146; INAS. This program was&#13;
designed to transfer the beneficiaries of the PSA who were capable of working to another&#13;
scheme that would integrate them into the workplace. Before INAS suspended the program&#13;
in 2011, pending a thorough review of its programs, it provides employers with a subsidy of&#13;
MT 450 a month to hire them. The agreement between INAS and the employers was that,&#13;
after the 12-month period, INAS would provide 70 percent of the beneficiaries with income-&#13;
generating opportunities and the employer would absorb the remaining 30 percent into its&#13;
workforce. A total of 4,029 people (including 3,243 women) benefitted from this scheme in&#13;
2010, at a cost to INAS of MT 27.3 million. Although there has been no formal evaluation of&#13;
the program, INAS managers recognize that there have been problems with coordination&#13;
between INAS and the employers, resulting in a lack of absorption of people into the&#13;
workforce after the 12-month period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
204.       Adult Education (EducaÃ§Ã£o de Adultos) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Education. The Adult Education&#13;
program run by the Ministry of Education aims to reduce adult illiteracy from 48 percent to&#13;
30 percent by 2014. In 2010, the Ministry of Education recruited 32,090 literacy teachers to&#13;
run 3,724 literacy and adult education units for a stipend of MT 550 per month. In 2010,&#13;
484,685 people (382,887 of whom were women) participated in the regular program. If&#13;

&amp;#12;other programs for increasing literary are considered (Alfa-radio stage, PROFASA, and&#13;
others), about 1.1 million people are expected to be reached by the program.119&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
205.    National Employment and Professional Development Institute (Instituto Nacional de&#13;
Emprego e FormaÃ§Ã£o Profissional) â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Labor. The INEFP has a mandate to recruit&#13;
and place people who are unemployed with registered employers who are looking for staff.&#13;
It also offers short professional training courses through its 11 provincial professional&#13;
training centers. In 2010, the INEFP helped to place 52,359 people in jobs (10,470 of whom&#13;
were women) through employment centers. Overall, the INEFP operates with a staff of 38&#13;
trainers. It offers training only in basic skills. The minimum requirement that a candidate&#13;
must meet to attend training is to know how to read and write. Generally, there is no&#13;
charge for the courses, but in some cases a â&#128;&#156;minimumâ&#128;&#157; charge may apply and no stipend to&#13;
poor students is offered. Responsibility for the courses and budgets are decentralized to&#13;
the provincial centers and are thus very fragmented. In 2010, the INEFP provided training to&#13;
8,555 people (other public and private bodies trained another 69,000 people). In addition, it&#13;
provided training in the provinces of Sofala and Tete to 261 people through its mobile&#13;
unit.120 Recently the INEFP has trained 11,000 workers for MOSAL the new aluminum&#13;
company of Mozambique, and is now training 120 workers for VAL Tete, a coal company. It&#13;
has implemented several courses with ILO and UNDP financing.121 In 2010, the INEFP&#13;
invested MT 23.6 million. The INEFP has been a beneficiary of the Technical and Vocational&#13;
Education and Training Project being implemented with the support of the World Bank&#13;
(US$27.4 million between 2006 and 2011). The projectâ&#128;&#153;s objectives are to help to transform&#13;
the existing technical and vocational education training system into a demand-led training&#13;
system and to provide beneficiaries with more market-relevant skills and better economic&#13;
opportunities. The project is developing or has already created: (i) an Institutional&#13;

206.       Agricultural Inputs Voucher Program (Senhas para Insumos AgrÃ­colas) â&#128;&#146;&#13;
GOM/FAO/USAID. The program is funded by the European Union and is implemented in five&#13;
provinces and 17 districts of Mozambique. It is implemented by the GOM and FAO in&#13;
collaboration, with the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) providing&#13;
technical assistance and coordination with suppliers and agro-dealers. USAID provided&#13;
funds for the initial design and preparation of the program. The goal of the program is to&#13;
promote the use of fertilizer and improved varieties of seed by smallholder farmers to&#13;
increase production of food crops and thus increase their incomes. Since smallholder&#13;
farmers in most cases cannot afford the cost of the inputs, they are given a discount&#13;
voucher to increase their direct purchasing power and make the inputs more affordable and&#13;
thus attractive to them. In order to encourage the establishment of input markets and&#13;
distribution networks, the inputs are supplied by private sector agro-dealers. In 2009/10,&#13;
the program distributed 20,626 vouchers to farmers to buy improved seeds and fertilizers â&#128;&#146;&#13;
12,926 vouchers for maize and 7,700 for rice production. The subsidies amounted to MT&#13;
42.9 million, with farmers contributing with an additional MT 21.3 million for the purchase&#13;
of inputs.122&#13;

&amp;#12;5.     Programs for People aged 60 Years and Older&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
207.   For the elderly, there are old age pension programs and two INAS programs, the&#13;
Food Subsidy Program (PSA) that targets, among others, the elderly poor and the Centers of&#13;
Support to the Elderly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
208.   Pensions (PensÃµes). As mentioned in Chapter II of this report, Mozambique has three&#13;
major pension plans: the National Institute of Social Security (INSS), which covers the&#13;
private sector, and two MOF plans that cover civil servants and the military. This is part of&#13;
the compulsory social protection regime established in Article 6 of Law no 4/2007 on Social&#13;
Protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
209.   The INSS was created in 1990 with a mandate to protect private sector workers&#13;
against the risk of the partial or total reduction of their work income by granting subsidies&#13;
covering disease, invalidity, old age, and death. The system covers all salaried workers,&#13;
whether nationals or foreign residents, as well as their dependent family members. Law&#13;
4/2007 of February 7 makes it obligatory for all employed workers and self-employed&#13;
workers to be affiliated with the INSS. According to Regulation of Obligatory Social Security&#13;
Decree 53/2007 of December 3, the affiliation of domestic employees, artists, sportsmen&#13;
and women, and agricultural workers will be determined by the Minister of Labor taking&#13;
into account the INSSâ&#128;&#153;s capacity. The INSS still has to develop a strategy to incorporate self-&#13;
employed workers. The rate of contribution to the INSS is 7 percent of a personâ&#128;&#153;s wage, 3&#13;
percent paid by the worker and 4 percent paid by the employer. Workers' contributions are&#13;
deducted directly from their wages every month and, together with their employerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution, is paid to the INSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
210.   Table 3.3 indicates that fewer than half of the contributors (enterprises) enrolled in&#13;
the INSS pension system are active, while only one-third of the beneficiaries (workers) are&#13;
active. As a result, the INSS covers less than 3 percent of the labor force. It is estimated that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               85&#13;
&amp;#12;the employed labor force in 2009 constituted 9 million people, and of this total, 340,000&#13;
worked in the public sector and 3.4 million were unpaid family workers. The remaining 5.3&#13;
million are the INSSâ&#128;&#153;s potential affiliates. Since there were only 239,304 active members in&#13;
the INSS in 2009, the potential to increase coverage is very large (5 million workers). Even&#13;
considering only those working for private firms, an estimated 700,000 workers, the INSS&#13;
could triple its coverage.&#13;

211.       The INSSâ&#128;&#153;s retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women. Contributors with more&#13;
than 30 years of membership or 300 months of contributions may also retire. In 2009, over&#13;
one-half (51 percent) of INSS expenditures were on old age pensions (Table 3.4) that&#13;
benefitted 13,773 retirees.123 Old age, invalidity, and survivor pensions amount to 86&#13;
percent of its expenditure and the remainder to various subsidies. Overall, the INSSâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
spending in 2009 was MT 689.8 million, equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP.&#13;

  212.     The MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pension plans are also financed by a payroll contribution from each civil&#13;
  servant of 7 percent of their salary. The plan for civil servants is regulated by the General&#13;
  Statute of State Employees (EGFE), Decree 14/87 of May 20, and the military plan is&#13;
  regulated by the Social Security Regulations of the Armed Forces of Mozambique approved&#13;
  by Decree 3/86 of June 25. The military pensions have been given to those who fought in&#13;
  the independence war (about 46,000) and to those who fought in the 16-year civil war&#13;
  (about 30,000). These beneficiaries obviously did not contribute to their pensions. In the&#13;
  case of the civil servantsâ&#128;&#153; plan, in addition to the 7 percent retirement contribution, civil&#13;
  servants contribute 1.5 percent for medical insurance and 0.5 percent for the funeral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        87&#13;
&amp;#12;subsidy. The medical insurance provides them with free care in public facilities. Civil&#13;
servants may also obtain support for treatment abroad, but access to this benefit is not&#13;
clearly regulated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
213.   For civil servants, retirement is granted after 35 years of services or upon reaching&#13;
the age of 55 for women and 60 for men and having at least 15 years of service. After 35&#13;
years of service, civil servants no longer have to contribute to the system. For those with 35&#13;
years of service, the replacement rate is 100 percent of their last salary, while for those with&#13;
fewer years of service, the replacement rate is given by the following formula: years of&#13;
service/35* last salary). According to MOF officials, contributions (from civil servants) cover&#13;
only about one-third of MOF expenditures on both plans. In 2010 the GOM spent MT 5,646&#13;
million, equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP, on both plans to the benefit of 34,293 civil and&#13;
75,923 military retirees (Table 3.5).&#13;

214.    Food Subsidy Program (Programa de Subsidio de Alimentos) â&#128;&#146; INAS. This program,&#13;
the PSA, provides a regular transfer to people who are unable to work and who live in&#13;
poverty. The PSA is the only regular, governmental, non-contributory social transfer in&#13;
Mozambique. Specifically, the program targets the elderly, the disabled, and people with&#13;
chronic diseases and their dependents. The PSA is a national program, but its coverage in&#13;
the remote rural areas is low, and the geographic expansion of the program is a priority for&#13;
the National Institute of Social Action (INAS). The transfer ranges from MT 100 for a one-&#13;
person household to MT 300 for a household of five people or more â&#128;&#146; in other words, one&#13;
direct beneficiary and four or more indirect beneficiaries (see Table 4.13 below). The new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    89&#13;
&amp;#12;payment scale became effective in January 2008 and represents an increase from MT 70 to&#13;
MT 100 (single person household) and from MT 140 to MT 300 in the last level (four or&#13;
more indirect beneficiaries). In 2010, the PSA reached 217,683 direct beneficiaries (139,818&#13;
of whom were women) and 236,451 indirect beneficiaries for a total of 454,134&#13;
beneficiaries at a cost of MT 389.1 million. Of the total number of beneficiaries, 94 percent&#13;
are elderly, 5 percent disabled, and 1 percent chronically ill.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
215.    Social Service Institutions and Old Age Homes (Unidades Sociais-Centros de Apoio a&#13;
Velhice) â&#128;&#146; INAS. Social service institutions house people who are living in absolute poverty&#13;
and have been abandoned or marginalized. These include old peopleâ&#128;&#153;s homes. INAS directly&#13;
manages 12 old age homes. In 2010 it provided services to 835 people at a cost of MT 7.6&#13;
million.124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      Programs for Household Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
216.    There are several programs that aim at addressing the vulnerabilities of poor&#13;
households related to health, disability, gender discrimination, lack of basic services, and&#13;
natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
217.    Direct Social Assistance (Apoio Social Directo) â&#128;&#146; INAS. The PASD program aims to&#13;
provide financial, material, and psychosocial support to individuals or groups of individuals&#13;
in a situation of absolute poverty. It focuses specifically on orphaned and vulnerable&#13;
children, malnourished pregnant women, needy twin children, children with nutritional&#13;
problems, abandoned children, the chronically ill, needy families, and victims of natural&#13;
disasters and other serious unexpected incidents. In 2010 the number of beneficiaries of&#13;
Direct Social Assistance was 26,628 (including 14,422 females) at a cost of MT 58.6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
124&#13;
   Estimates by the author based on total spending reported by INAS and the spending projections on social&#13;
services from MMAS (2011).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    90&#13;
&amp;#12;million.125 About 38 percent of the beneficiaries were orphans, 15 percent twins, 11 percent&#13;
undernourished children, 8 percent children whose mother could not breastfeed, 5 percent&#13;
people with disabilities, 4 percent elderly, and 3 percent child heads of households. The&#13;
PASD is a national program but the actual coverage is low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
218.       National AIDS Council (ComissÃ£o Nacional Combate SIDA). The GOM has approved&#13;
several important instruments to strengthen the combat against HIV/AIDS. In 2007 the&#13;
GOM approved the Strategy of Nutritional Support for People Living with HIV/AIDS and&#13;
Other Chronic Diseases. Then, in December 2008, it approved the National Strategy to&#13;
Speed Up HIV Prevention, which stresses the need to take urgent measures to expand&#13;
programs designed to increase knowledge and change behavior that puts the population at&#13;
risk of HIV infection. Finally in 2010 it approved the National Strategic Plan III to Combat the&#13;
Pandemic.126&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
219.       The GOM is commitment to ensuring universal access to treatment by HIV/AIDS&#13;
patients. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been decentralized and integrated into the&#13;
health system as well as the prevention of mother to child transmission, and counseling and&#13;
testing. This has resulted, in a relatively short period of time, in a significant increase in&#13;
coverage of both adults and children. People living with HIV who initiate ART and have&#13;
nutritional needs now have access to food support (see below). People living with HIV also&#13;
saw their rights better protected through Law No. 12/2009 of March 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
220.       According to the Minister of Health, of the 425,089 adult patients (over 15 years old)&#13;
that need ART, 156,688 (37 percent) were receiving it in 2009. In the same year, there were&#13;
47,800 children in need of treatment, and 13,510 (28 percent) were receiving it. Coverage&#13;
varied widely among the regions. While 43 percent of children and 65 percent of adults&#13;
were covered in the Southern region, the corresponding coverage rates were 13 percent&#13;

221.    The National AIDS Council develops and coordinates AIDS policies and programs. In&#13;
the past it had a grant facility for civil society and non-state actors, but now it is mainly&#13;
working with the public sector in mainstreaming policymaking and coordination. Its budget&#13;
in 2010 was MT 252.6 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
222.    Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PrevenÃ§Ã£o TransmissÃ£o de SIDA&#13;
â&#128;&#146; Ministry of Health. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission is one of the priorities of&#13;
the prevention component in the strategy for reducing HIV/AIDS and is managed by the&#13;
Ministry of Health through the National Health System. The estimated number of HIV-&#13;
positive pregnant women is around 150,000 per year. The PMTCT program, which has&#13;
national coverage, was started in 2002. By 2010, 909 health facilities were offering PMTCT&#13;
programs (or 83 percent of the 1,090 health facilities with antenatal care services). In 2010,&#13;
624,949 pregnant women attended antenatal services for the first time and, of those,&#13;
464,524 (74 percent) received counseling and testing. Of all HIV-positive pregnant women&#13;
in the country, 32,676 (41 percent) received ART.128 The main reasons for the low coverage&#13;
of the PMTCT are the low percentage of women who attend antenatal clinics and the&#13;
limited availability of PMTCT treatment within the health system.129&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
223.    Basic Food Basket for People in ART (Senhas para a Cesta BÃ¡sica Nutricional) â&#128;&#146; In&#13;
2009 the government introduced a food voucher program (Cesta BÃ¡sica) for those taking&#13;
ART and with nutrition deficiencies. Initially the Cesta BÃ¡sica program aimed to reach 3,500&#13;
malnourished people in 11 provincial capital cities during the first six months of treatment.&#13;
The voucher system seeks to reduce the logistical and operational overheads of traditional&#13;

&amp;#12;food delivery mechanisms and to empower local markets by using resources at the targeted&#13;
sites. In 2010 the government asked the WFP to support the expansion of the Cesta BÃ¡sica&#13;
to 51 additional health facilities to provide vouchers for food to an additional 3,500&#13;
malnourished people living with HIV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
224.    Support to People with Chronic Illness (Apoio a Pessoas com DoenÃ§as CrÃ³nicas) -&#13;
PMA. Under the Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 2008-2011, the WFP supports&#13;
the national response to HIV and AIDS by providing nutritional support to an estimated&#13;
30,000 moderately malnourished ART clients per year. During the first six months of their&#13;
treatment, the WTF provides beneficiaries with food to help them with their nutritional&#13;
recovery and drug adherence. The WFP food assistance is distributed in collaboration with&#13;
the Ministry of Health through the existing public health delivery system and through a&#13;
wide range of NGOs. The monthly food support includes 25kg of cereals, 5kg of pulses, and&#13;
10kg of corn soya blend (CSB). The GOM has indicated that it would like to gradually&#13;
substitute the delivery of food items with the voucher system wherever feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
225.    Social Units for the Handicapped (Unidades Sociais Centros de Transito) â&#128;&#146; INAS.&#13;
Social service institutions include transit centers for the disabled. As of 2010, the MMAS&#13;
managed six of these institutions, which catered to 303 people. It is estimated that the cost&#13;
of running these centers was MT 1.9 million in 2010.130&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
226.    Domestic Violence. In December 2009, the President of Mozambique promulgated&#13;
the Law against Domestic Violence (Law No. 29/2008), which made domestic violence a&#13;
crime in Mozambique. This brought Mozambique closer to being in line with the Convention&#13;
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The GOM now&#13;
has the mandate to ensure the protection of women and children against abuse and sexual&#13;

&amp;#12;exploitation at home and in the community. The law emphasizes prevention but increases&#13;
the sanctions for offenders and requires the GOM to provide assistance to the victims.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
227.    The MMAS runs a series of programs to empower women. It has conducted 15&#13;
workshops to disseminate the national and international Instruments for the Defense of the&#13;
Human Rights of Women, held 48 dissemination sessions on the National Plan for&#13;
Preventing and Combating Violence against Women involving 1,868 people, and has chaired&#13;
five training sessions for journalists, police, and community leaders on violence and human&#13;
rights. In addition, it initiated the construction of six pilot Women Training Centers and&#13;
inaugurated a Center for the Promotion of Women for an association of 115 craftswomen in&#13;
the district of Palma in Cabo Delgado province. It has also identified premises for two&#13;
shelters (centers of refuge) for women victims of violence, one being in the district of Caia&#13;
and another in Beira City, in the provÃ­nce of Sofala.131&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
228.    Women Entrepreneurship (PotenciaÃ§Ã£o de Habilidades Empresariais Femininas) â&#128;&#146;&#13;
MMAS/ADB). This program, which aims to empower women, is supported by the African&#13;
Development Bank (ADB). In 2010, it supported 4,500 women organized in 350 groups or&#13;
associations in the provinces of Sofala and Manica. In 2010 the program invested MT 28.5&#13;
million.132&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
229.    Subsidies. The GOM has three types of major subsidies â&#128;&#146; on fuel, on wheat flour for&#13;
bread, and to cover the operating deficits of various public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
230.    Mozambique has traditionally adjusted fuel prices once per month based on a&#13;
market-based formula. At the peak of the food and fuel price shock in February 2008, the&#13;
government introduced an adjustment factor that kept fuel prices below market prices. In&#13;

   The numbers covered come from a direct communication with MMAS, while the amount invested comes&#13;
from Ministry of Finance (2010).&#13;

&amp;#12;April 2009 it froze retailer prices and asked fuel importers to continue to provide fuel below&#13;
market prices. In March 2010, the government began gradually increasing the prices of all&#13;
petroleum products other than diesel to market levels in August 2010, with a cumulative&#13;
price increase of 73 percent. Diesel prices were raised by 38 percent in May 2010 but&#13;
remain below market levels.133&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
231.       An agreement between the GOM and fuel importers to settle outstanding claims for&#13;
2008 and 2009 became effective in February 2010. The GOM also paid compensation for&#13;
below-market fuel prices in 2010 until the end of May 2010. The fuel subsidy has resulted in&#13;
higher than estimated budgetary costs in 2010 (1.4 percent instead of 0.6 percent of GDP).&#13;
Table 3.6 details the cost of the fuel subsidies in 2010 as well as the cost of the subsidies for&#13;
bread (0.02 percent of GDP) and of those to cover the operational deficit of 5 public&#13;
enterprises, namely Radio Mozambique (RÃ¡dio de Mozambique), Mozambique Television&#13;
(TelevisÃ£o de Mozambique), Public Transports of Maputo (Transportes PÃºblicos do Maputo),&#13;
Public Transports of Beira (Transportes PÃºblicos da Beira), and Chockwe Hydraulic&#13;
(HidrÃ¡ulica de Chockwe).&#13;

&amp;#12;232.       Community Development (Desenvolvimento ComunitÃ¡rio) â&#128;&#146; INAS. The Community&#13;
Development Program managed by INAS aims to promote socioeconomic development in&#13;
local communities by supporting households and individuals that are living in absolute&#13;
poverty. In addition, the program seeks to construct and maintain minor community&#13;
infrastructure (for example, classrooms, health facilities, and water points). In 2010, the&#13;
program executed 19 projects that benefitted 49,852 people at a cost of MT 18.6 million.&#13;
However, INAS has identified some problems with the program including a lack of resources&#13;
to carry out inspections and monitoring, a lack of impact evaluations, and the complexity&#13;
involved in the coordinating the activities of the program without adequate staff and&#13;
expertise. INAS has suspended the implementation of this program in 2011 pending a&#13;
thorough review of its program portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
233.       Risk Reduction â&#128;&#146; INGC/WFP. In 2010, the GOM through the National Institute for the&#13;
Management of Natural Disasters (INGC) continued to implement the Master Plan for the&#13;
Management, Prevention, and Mitigation of Natural Disasters (Plano Director de GestÃ£o de&#13;
PrevenÃ§Ã£o e MitigaÃ§Ã£o das Calamidades). This plan seeks to: (i) reduce the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
vulnerability to natural disasters; (ii) guarantee a rapid response to emergency situations&#13;
and post-disaster reconstruction; and (iii) promote the reintegration into society of those&#13;
who are adversely affected. In 2010, there was no major disaster so the INGC continued to&#13;
support victims of previous disasters (the 2007 and 2008 Zambezi and Save river floods) and&#13;
poor families in situation of food insecurity with the support of the WFP.134&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
234.       The Reduction of Risks and Emergency Readiness (Fortalecimento da ReduÃ§Ã£o de&#13;
Riscos de Calamidades e da ProntidÃ£o para EmergÃªncia). This is a joint UN program initiated&#13;
in 2008 that aims to strengthen Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to mitigate the humanitarian&#13;
impact of emergencies on vulnerable populations. The program focuses on strengthening&#13;
institutional frameworks and systems for disaster preparedness, response, and disaster risk&#13;

&amp;#12;reduction at the national, provincial, district, and community levels. It supports the GOM in&#13;
mainstreaming disaster management plans and policies and in developing and promoting&#13;
cross-sectoral dialogue. The WFP is: (i) supporting the provision and installation of&#13;
telecommunications equipment in the regional centers and training of workers to operate&#13;
it; (ii) providing support to the Eduardo Mondlane University to carry out the mapping and&#13;
identification of risk assessment capabilities in the INGC; (iii) facilitating the involvement of&#13;
rural communities in the implementation of disaster mitigation activities in selected areas,&#13;
particularly districts in the southern provinces that are susceptible to cyclical droughts.&#13;
These activities include the conservation of agriculture, small-scale irrigation projects, and&#13;
the increased adoption of grain or crops that are tolerant to droughts and disease and pest-&#13;
resistant. Many activities are carried out through food-for-work schemes in which labor&#13;
comes from the community itself.135 In 2010, 4,000 households participated in the program,&#13;
and the overall cost of the program was MT 109.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
235.       Protection and Promotion of Livelihoods (PromoÃ§Ã£o e ProtecÃ§Ã£o de MÃ©dios de Vida).&#13;
This program, which was initiated in the mid-1970s, is implemented by the WFP and aims to&#13;
prevent and mitigate natural disasters and reduce the impact of climate change. It focuses&#13;
on the arid areas prone to natural disasters and areas of food insecurity in accordance with&#13;
the directives of SETSAN. It is a food-for-work program that helps communities to build&#13;
small dams, irrigation schemes, access roads, bridges, classrooms, and waiting houses for&#13;
pregnant women. The program covers 400 to 800 households per district. The INGC targets&#13;
those districts that contain the most vulnerable populations. The beneficiaries remain in the&#13;
program for six to eight months.&#13;

      Information received directly from the WFP (questionnaire).&#13;

&amp;#12;236.   Climate Change Adaptation (Programa Conjunto da NaÃ§Ãµes Unidas em ValorizaÃ§Ã£o&#13;
Ambiental e AdaptaÃ§Ã£o Ã s MudanÃ§as ClimÃ¡ticas em MoÃ§ambique). This program is&#13;
implemented with WFP support. It aims to reduce the risk that climate change will&#13;
adversely affect vulnerable areas by incorporating environmental aspects in programs and&#13;
plans at the central and local levels. It further aims to increase the adaptability of&#13;
communities by strengthening the mechanisms of management and diversification of their&#13;
way of life. It focuses on the region along the Limpopo basin, with an emphasis on the&#13;
Chicualacuala district (arid and semi-arid) in the Gaza province. The WFP is: (i) providing&#13;
expertise and leadership in the area of disaster management and vulnerability mapping; (ii)&#13;
leading the process of analyzing vulnerability and compiling an information base about food&#13;
security; and (iii) supporting disaster risk analysis and mapping. Most of the activities are&#13;
being executed through food-for-work schemes. It is expected to reach 1,000 households&#13;
per year and to provide food for work for nine months. The overall cost of the program is&#13;
expected to be US$7 million over a three-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
237.   In sum, Mozambique has a large number of social protection programs that seek to&#13;
address all of the major risks that we identified in Chapter II. However, there is&#13;
fragmentation among programs and some duplication while at the same time there are&#13;
some important program gaps. These issues are further discussed in Chapter IV.&#13;

&amp;#12;            Chapter 4: Assessment of the Social Protection System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
238.   In this section, we assess Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection system, focusing on&#13;
spending and budget arrangements; coverage, gaps, and overlaps; generosity; targeting and&#13;
selection mechanisms; cost-effectiveness; institutional and coordination arrangements;&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; and sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     Spending and Budget Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
239.   In view of the drop in external financing and the large responsibilities assumed with&#13;
fuel subsidies, the GOM was forced to cut back on the budgets of the Ministry of Education,&#13;
the Ministry of Health, and the MMAS in 2010. However, INASâ&#128;&#153;s expenditures were&#13;
increased as the governments of the Netherlands and the UK began supporting the PSA.&#13;
Here we briefly review expenditures on education, health, and social protection (SP) and&#13;
existing arrangements for budget execution. Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s social protection (SP) spending&#13;
is benchmarked against its neighboring countries and we analyze the allocation of SP&#13;
expenditures by age groups, SP spending according to the GOMâ&#128;&#153;s three SP pillars (basic,&#13;
compulsory, and complementary social security) and its sources of funding, and spending&#13;
according to the World Bank SP classification.&#13;

240.    In 2010, the GOM spent 6.3 percent of GDP on education, down from 6.6 percent in&#13;
2009. However, this was still higher than the average of 5 percent of GDP for all the&#13;
developing countries of Sub-Saharan (Table 4.2).136 According to the Reports on the&#13;
Execution of the State Budget for 2008, 2009 and 2010, total education spending&#13;
(consolidated for all levels of government) corresponds to one-fifth of overall public&#13;
spending.137 About 21 percent of education spending was financed from external sources in&#13;
2010, a decline from 30 percent in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, the absolute amount of&#13;
external financing remained almost flat, and financing from domestic sources increased by&#13;
170 percent.138 External financing includes all programs financed with external resources&#13;
that are classified as investments. These investment programs include subsidies for those&#13;
working on literacy campaigns and support for education supervision, teacher training, and&#13;
institutional building. While the average execution during the last two years of recurrent&#13;
expenditures and local financing was 99 percent and 94 percent respectively, the execution&#13;
of external financing was only 69 percent. This shortfall in external execution contributed to&#13;
an overall execution rate of 89 percent.&#13;

241.     Table 4.3 shows the distribution of education expenditures by level of education.&#13;
Unfortunately, three-quarters of total expenditures are not assigned to a particular level of&#13;
education in the Report on the Execution of the Budget. It can be assumed that most of this&#13;
unassigned amount was used to pay teachersâ&#128;&#153; salaries.139 However information on the&#13;
execution of the budget of the Priority Programs (Table VI) indicates that the share of higher&#13;
education in total education spending increased from 12.9 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in&#13;
2010, while the share of general education declined from 87.1 percent to 83 percent. Table&#13;
4.3 shows that the fastest growing budgets were those for secondary and preprimary&#13;
education though from lower bases than the primary and tertiary levels. For all levels of&#13;
education, the execution of recurrent expenditures was 100 percent, the execution of local&#13;
financing was over 90 percent of the budgeted amounts, while the execution of external&#13;
financing was only between 60 and 76 percent of the amount budgeted. Of total external&#13;
resources, 32 percent financed primary education, 13 percent financed secondary, 6&#13;
&#13;
139&#13;
   Of the total amount not assigned to a specific level, 90 percent was recurrent spending and 10 percent was&#13;
investment, of which about one-third was financed by external sources. Since in most education systems,&#13;
teachersâ&#128;&#153; salaries constitute the bulk of recurrent costs and the allocations in the table for primary and&#13;
secondary education show relatively low recurrent costs, it is reasonable to conclude that most of these funds&#13;
were used to pay for teacherâ&#128;&#153;s salaries.&#13;
&#13;

                                                      105&#13;
&amp;#12;percent financed tertiary, 1 percent financed pre-primary, and 47 percent financed â&#128;&#156;other&#13;
expenditures.â&#128;&#157; While most (91 percent) of pre-primary education expenditure in 2008 and&#13;
2009 was financed by external sources, in 2010 external resources financed less than one-&#13;
third of total expenditures. At the primary level, most (95 percent) of the overall&#13;
expenditure was financed from external sources in 2010 and 2008, though in 2009,&#13;
financing was evenly divided between local and external sources. At the secondary level,&#13;
again most of the expenditures (92 percent) were financed by external sources between&#13;
2008 and 2010. Finally at the tertiary level, three-quarters of the expenditures were&#13;
financed by local resources.&#13;

242.       Public health expenditures (consolidated for all levels of government) as a share of&#13;
GDP in Mozambique declined from 3 percent in 2008 to 2.9 percent in 2009, and to 2.5&#13;
percent in 2010 (Table 4.4). They are now lower than the average of 2.6 percent of GDP for&#13;
the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.140 Within total health expenditures, 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

      It is reported that an important share of project financing remains off-budget. See UNICEF (2011), p. 81.&#13;

&amp;#12;percent financed HIV/AIDs programs (Conselho Nacional Combate a HIV/SIDA) and the&#13;
other 97 percent financed the Ministry of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s programs. The budget of the National&#13;
Council to Combat AIDS (CNCS) has been cut in half since 2008 because of a sharp drop in&#13;
external financing. The Ministry of Health and CNCS budgets combined constitute only 8&#13;
percent of total public spending. About 40 percent of health spending was financed from&#13;
external sources in 2010, down from 54 percent in 2008. Indeed between 2008 and 2010&#13;
the absolute amount of external financing declined by 15 percent, while domestic finance&#13;
increased by 58 percent.141 Similarly to the situation in the education sector, while 99&#13;
percent and 97 percent of recurrent expenditures and local financing were executed on&#13;
average during the last three years, the execution of external financing was only 60 percent&#13;
of the amount budgeted. The shortfall in external execution contributed to an overall&#13;
execution rate of 74 percent, though budget execution has been improving in recent years.&#13;

&amp;#12;243.   Table 4.5 presents the distribution of health expenditures by level of medical care.&#13;
Public health absorbs 35 percent of total Ministry of Health expenditures, general and&#13;
specialized hospitals absorb 16 percent, and the remaining 48 percent is not allocated to&#13;
any health level in the Report of Budgetary Execution. The overall share of public health&#13;
declined from 44 percent in 2008 to 35 percent in 2010, while the share of hospitals and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;othersâ&#128;&#157; has been increasing. Indeed, the budget of public health declined by 8 percent&#13;
between 2008 and 2010, while the budget of general and specialized hospitals increased by&#13;
61 percent and 26 percent respectively during the same period. The budget for public&#13;
health is financed almost 50/50 by external and local resources, while 88 percent of the&#13;
general hospital budget is financed by local resources and 12 percent from external sources,&#13;
and 99 percent of the specialized hospital budget is financed by local sources and 1 percent&#13;
from external sources. Of total external financing for the health budget received during the&#13;
last three years, 35 percent was allocated to public health, 63 percent to â&#128;&#156;other,â&#128;&#157; and about&#13;
2 percent to hospitals. The execution of the budget for the different levels is once again&#13;
mostly a function of the execution of external finance. Total budget execution ranged from&#13;
75 percent for public health to 99 percent for specialized hospitals and, in general, it has&#13;
been improving.&#13;

244.    Public expenditure in social safety nets in Mozambique is relatively low, but there is&#13;
significant scope to improve the effectiveness of current spending. The national budget&#13;
expenditure for social protection accounted for 2.8 percent of the GDP in 2010, from which&#13;
about 0.7 percentage points correspond to social assistance programs (mostly non-&#13;
contributory transfers) and more than 2 percent are pensions. This figure excludes&#13;
programs financed by development partners, and other social assistance interventions&#13;
under the education and health sectors. If these expenditures were taken into account,&#13;
social protection would reach about 3.8 percent of the GDP in 2010. Social assistance would&#13;
count for 1.8 percent which, compared with other African countries, is still relatively low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;when compare with neighbor countries. These figures exclude fuel and other subsidies,&#13;
estimated in about 1 percent of the GDP in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
245.    The budgets and executed expenditures for 2008 to 2010 for the MMAS and INAS&#13;
are summarized in Table 4.6. It shows the expenditures at the central, provincial, and local&#13;
levels including INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs (PASD, PBST, PGR, DC, and Unidades Sociais).142 During this&#13;
period, the consolidated expenditures represented about 1.3 percent of total GOM&#13;
expenditures and 0.4 percent of GDP. INAS represents about two-thirds of the combined&#13;
expenditures of INAS and the MMAS (including programs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142&#13;
   In the case of MMAS, this includes the Provincial Directorate of Women and Social Action (DirecÃ§Ã£o&#13;
Provincial da Mulher e da AcÃ§Ã£o Social) and in the case of the INAS, it includes its Provincial Offices or&#13;
Delegations (DelegaÃ§Ãµes Provinciais). INAS programs are shown separately in the table because they are&#13;
budgeted as part of the Government Transfer to Families under General State Obligations ( Encargos Gerais do&#13;
Estado).&#13;

&amp;#12;246.       The MMASâ&#128;&#153;s executed budget has declined by 28 percent, from MT 456 million in&#13;
2008 to MT 327 million in 2010. Both local and external financing for â&#128;&#156;investmentâ&#128;&#157; (in other&#13;
words, programs) declined by over 50 percent, while recurrent expenditures increased by&#13;
19 percent. In contrast, INASâ&#128;&#153;s expenditures have more than doubled over the last three&#13;
years, as the GOM increased the value of the transfer provided by the PSA and the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s coverage with the support of the Governments of the UK and the Netherlands.&#13;
Indeed, the fastest growing expenditures were those of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs. In 2010, external&#13;
finance represented 29 percent of total MMAS and INAS combined expenditures. In 2010&#13;
there was a large over-execution of the budget by INAS (158 percent) as the original budget&#13;
underestimated the amount of external financing spent on the PSA. However, for all&#13;
programs excluding the PSA, execution averaged only 76 percent of the amount budgeted.&#13;
Of the PSA revised budget, which amounted to MT 521.9 million, only MT 389 million were&#13;
executed or 75 percent.143 This reflects the weak execution capacity of INASâ&#128;&#153;s delegations.&#13;

 248.      Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of family transfers (excluding pensions) by level of&#13;
 government. It can be seen that in the last three years about 45 percent of the resources&#13;
 were distributed directly to the provinces and the remaining amount was managed at&#13;
 central level. The trend in Mozambique is to further decentralize resource management to&#13;
 the provincial and district level as the State Financial Administration System (Sistema de&#13;
 AdministraÃ§Ã£o Financeira do Estado, SISTAFE) is gradually expanding to all districts.&#13;

249.       The SISTAFE was created in 2002 (Law 9/2002 of February 12) and its regulations&#13;
were approved in 2004 (Decree 23/2004 of August 20).144 Provinces and districts operate as&#13;
agencies of the central government ministries on a devolved basis. They are collectively&#13;
referred to as local governments and operate under the local government laws and&#13;
regulations, although they also fall under the remit of the SISTAFE. Since 2007, the&#13;
computerized and integrated System of State Finance Administration, commonly known as&#13;
â&#128;&#156;e-SISTAFE,â&#128;&#157; has been rolled out at district level. This allows for expenditures to be directly&#13;
executed via the integrated budget, payment, and accounting system of e-SISTAFE.&#13;
Payments are made according to the programming, commitment, liquidation, and payment&#13;
steps and following the internal control procedures built into the system. Payments are&#13;
made directly from the single treasury account and are accounted for in the e-SISTAFE.&#13;

&amp;#12;250.     Since the implementation of e-SISTAFE, improvements have been seen in the&#13;
following areas: (i) increased use of direct budget execution; (ii) the expansion of e-SISTAFE&#13;
to the district level; (iii) a reduction in the use of commercial bank accounts; and (iv) the&#13;
decentralization of payrolls beginning in 2008. A census of pension beneficiaries has also&#13;
been performed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       Allocation of Resources by Age Group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
251.     Table 4.8 presents the distribution of social protection spending by age group and&#13;
the corresponding distribution of poverty. In 2010, fuel subsidies accounted for 28 percent&#13;
and MOF pension plans for 34 percent of total social protection spending. The amount&#13;
spent on the fuel subsidies was larger than the amount of SP spending on all the other age&#13;
groups (0-59) combined. The over 60 age cohort absorbed 68 percent of total spending on&#13;
all of the age groups, but it accounted only for 5.9 percent of the poor population (Q1). On&#13;
the other hand, children (0 to 17 years) represented over 55 percent of the poor (Q1) and&#13;
received only 25 percent of the spending on all of the age groups. Indeed, relatively little is&#13;
spent on the 0 to 5 age cohort, which comprises 24 percent of the poor (those in the lowest&#13;
quintile, Q1) but receives less than 3 percent of the amount that is spent on all of the age&#13;
groups. This is an indication that programs for families with children may be underfinanced&#13;
while spending on to programs for seniors is disproportionate. The MOF pension plans&#13;
contribute greatly to this result. More importantly, the amount spent on pensions only&#13;
benefit a selected group of people as over 88 percent of those aged over 60 receive no&#13;
pension (900,000 people). Therefore, 47 percent of the social protection resources&#13;
(excluding fuel subsidies) benefit 124,000 people aged over 60 who are better off than most&#13;
other Mozambicans,145 while the remaining 53 percent of SP resources are expected to&#13;
benefit the remaining 22 million Mozambicans, half of whom are poor. Even if pensions are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145&#13;
   Section V below shows that the average military or civil pension is equivalent to or higher than the total&#13;
consumption of Q4 households, though it is also important to recall that there is not a very big difference&#13;
between Q1 and Q4 consumption expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      117&#13;
&amp;#12;excluded from the over 60 age group and only social assistance programs are taken into&#13;
consideration (see Table 4.8), this group still receives 11.2 percent of the resources&#13;
allocated to all the age groups while accounting for only 5.9 percent of the poor (those in&#13;
Q1). In contrast, the 0 to 5 age group receives only 7.9 percent of the resources but&#13;
constitutes 23.5 percent of the poor.&#13;

252.        In sum, Mozambique spends a significant amount of its resources on social&#13;
protection. However, most of these resources are absorbed by MOF pension plans and fuel&#13;
subsidies, neither of which benefits the poor. On the other hand, programs for children and&#13;
youth seem to be relatively unattended. Available information suggests that spending on&#13;
social assistance in Mozambique is lower than the average for the other Sub-Saharan&#13;
African countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;3.     Spending and Financing by GOMâ&#128;&#153;s Social Protection Pillars&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
253.   The distribution of social protection resources between the three pillars of the&#13;
GOMâ&#128;&#153;s social protection framework is detailed in Table 4.9. As it can be seen, 30 percent of&#13;
overall social protection spending is allocated to basic social security, 38.2 percent to&#13;
compulsory social security (pensions), and the remaining 31.7 percent on subsidies (fuel,&#13;
public enterprises, and bread). If subsidies are excluded, 44.2 percent is spent on basic&#13;
social security and 55.8 percent on compulsory social security. Within basic social security,&#13;
Direct Action programs absorb 35.6 percent of spending; Education Social Action, 43.9&#13;
percent; Health Social Action, 13.1 percent; and Productive Social Action, 7.4 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
254.   External financing of social protection is shown in the last two columns of Table 4.9.&#13;
These estimates should be viewed with caution since they do not take directly into account:&#13;
(i) the overall external support to the GOM budget; (ii) the local resources that support the&#13;
implementation of programs but could not be identified as part of the financing of&#13;
individual programs/projects; and (iii) the external financing in kind or cash that is not&#13;
recorded in the budget. The estimates indicate that external resources finance about two-&#13;
thirds of basic social security, with 54 percent of external financing being allocated to&#13;
Education Social Action, 19 percent to Direct Social Action, 19 percent to Health Social&#13;
Action, and 8 percent to Productive Social Action. While external resources finance one-&#13;
third of Direct Social Action, they finance two-thirds of Education Social Action, 90 percent&#13;
of Health Social Action, and 69 percent of the Productive Social Action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
255.   In sum, basic social protection is dependent on external financing for two-thirds of&#13;
its financing. External resources finance one-third of Direct Social Action, two-thirds of&#13;
Education Social Action, 90 percent of Health Social Action, and 69 percent of Productive&#13;
Social Action.&#13;

&amp;#12;B.     Coverage, Gaps, and Overlaps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
257.   To provide some indication of whether the coverage of existing programs is high,&#13;
medium, or low, Table 4.11 presents estimates of the size of at-risk groups and the&#13;
coverage of each program. Out of the 37 programs for which some information has been&#13;
obtained, five programs have been identified as having high coverage, one with medium&#13;
coverage, and 31 with low coverage. Generally, the major social assistance programs in&#13;
Mozambique have low coverage relative to the number of individuals at risk, including the&#13;
unconditional cash transfers (PSA) and the other INAS programs, school lunches, HIV/AIDS&#13;
programs, training and scholarship programs, and the food for work program. The INSS has&#13;
low coverage given that it covers less than 5 percent of the labor force and that 88 percent&#13;
of the elderly have no pension. The MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pension plans cover all public employees and&#13;
therefore are classified as having high coverage, but public employees and their dependents&#13;
represent less than 3 percent of the population. The other programs with high coverage are&#13;
the micronutrient programs, which according to the Ministry of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s Surveillance&#13;
Program cover all the â&#128;&#156;intendedâ&#128;&#157; target groups though many children continue to suffer&#13;
from malnutrition (44 percent of those under the age of 5 are stunted). The program that is&#13;
classified as having medium coverage is adult education as it covers 1.1 million of the&#13;
estimated 5.9 million illiterate adults in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
258.   The expenditure data in the previous section and the program coverage data&#13;
indicate that some major program gaps exist. Those who remain largely uncovered by the&#13;
SP system in Mozambique are poor families with children, young people, and the working&#13;
poor, particularly those facing recurrent weather-related shocks. Another problem with the&#13;
system is that there is fragmentation and duplication of social insurance and social&#13;
assistance programs and little coordination among them that limits the effectiveness of&#13;
social protection spending. For instance, there are many, fragmented youth training&#13;
programs, and there are three major pension plans operated by the MOF and the INSS. INAS&#13;
has been implementing microcredit and training programs and building schools and health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              123&#13;
&amp;#12;posts even though other institutions in the government are specialists in these areas. There&#13;
is lack of coordination between INAS and the institutions in charge of education, health,&#13;
youth, training, and microenterprise programs. There is also lack of coordination between&#13;
public entities and NGOs and other civil society organizations that leads to much duplication&#13;
of efforts. Some analysts have indicated that there is a significant level of fragmentation and&#13;
duplication of efforts among programs and a lack of coordination between programs run by&#13;
NGOs working in the social sectors. For instance in the health sector, a number of&#13;
international organizations, donors, and NGOs are active in the sector (PEPFAR, the Clinton&#13;
Foundation, Save the Children, and the Bill Gates Foundation) and they all use their own&#13;
implementation mechanisms and financing channels rather than the state budget.146&#13;

&amp;#12;259.      In sum, the majority of programs in Mozambique have low coverage, and there are&#13;
important gaps in programming for poor families with children, young people, and the&#13;
working poor, particularly those facing recurrent weather related shocks. There is also&#13;
fragmentation and duplication of efforts among social protection programs and a lack of&#13;
coordination among programs that limits the effectiveness of social protection spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.        Generosity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
260.      Two issues related to program generosity are discussed in this subsection: (i)&#13;
whether the existing social protection programs are sufficiently generous to have the&#13;
expected impact or (ii) they are too generous and give the beneficiaries a disincentive to&#13;
work and save. A third concern relates to the sustainability of these programs, which will be&#13;
discussed below in Section H. To address these issues, we compare the benefits paid by the&#13;
major social insurance and social assistance programs with international benchmarks. We&#13;
focus on the PSA and pension plans, the major programs for which comparative information&#13;
exists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
261.      In the case of PSA, the program is designed to target those who cannot work&#13;
including the elderly poor, those with chronic illnesses or disabilities, and poor pregnant&#13;
women. Therefore, it cannot create a disincentive to work. According to INAS, 94 percent of&#13;
PSA beneficiaries are the elderly, 5 percent disabled, and 1 percent the chronically ill.147&#13;
Also, the program specifies that, if there is a person in the beneficiaryâ&#128;&#153;s household who&#13;
works or receives any other income (including seasonal income), in order for the beneficiary&#13;
to be eligible for PSA, the monthly per capita income of the household cannot exceed MT&#13;
100.148 Therefore, the focus of this discussion is on whether the benefits are large enough&#13;
to help beneficiary families to cover their basic needs.&#13;

&amp;#12;262.     Table 4.12 shows estimates of the generosity of various types of social assistance&#13;
programs in 19 countries as reported in a recent World Bank study. Program generosity is&#13;
defined as the program transfer divided by the average consumption expenditures&#13;
(excluding durables, housing, and health care) of the poorest households (those in Q1).&#13;

  e/ Family allowances. Cash transfer for families with children. Family allowances can take various forms,&#13;
  such as means-tested child benefits, birth grants, or universal transfers for all children under a fixed age.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
263.     The PSA is similar in concept to a social pension as it targets those who cannot work.&#13;
Table 4.14 shows the PSA transfer per month, which varies according to family size. The&#13;
actual average size of the PSA beneficiary family is two people,149 and these families receive&#13;
a transfer of MT 150 per month. To approximate the consumption expenditures excluding&#13;
durables, housing, and health care, only the consumption of food is considered. A family of&#13;
two in the poorest quintile (Q1) has a monthly food consumption of MT 630 (MT 10.5 per&#13;
capita per day). In this case, PSA generosity is 24 percent (150/630). This is below the&#13;
median of social pension programs (27 percent) in Table 4.13. In fact, if this PSA beneficiary&#13;
family in Q1 has no other source of income, the transfer will only cover seven days of food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
149&#13;
   In 2010, the PSA benefitted 217, 683 people directly (139,818 women and 77,865 men) and 236,451&#13;
indirect beneficiaries, close to a 1 to 1 ratio. During the first quarter of 2011 there were 214,811 direct&#13;
beneficiaries and 174,466, a ratio slightly below one (INAS (2010).&#13;

&amp;#12;during the month, with no money left over to pay for food for the remaining 23 days or for&#13;
other necessities.&#13;

264.      In this context, it is important to note that these estimates refer to 2008/09 prices&#13;
when the IOF 2008/09 was carried out. However, PSA transfers have not been adjusted&#13;
since January 2008, though Decree 19/93 of August 25 required that PSA benefits should be&#13;
adjusted annually. Indeed, the benefit was supposed to be kept at 30 percent of the&#13;
minimum wage, which in 2010 averaged MT 2,350,150 but the value of the PSA transfer&#13;
today is only 4 percent of the minimum wage. According to MMAS/INAS, since 2008 the&#13;
value of the transfer has declined by 26 percent.151&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
265.      The average and minimum retirement pension paid by the INSS in 2009 was MT&#13;
2,130 and 1,442 per month respectively. The replacement rate of the old age pension is 22&#13;
percent of the average taxable wage.152 The minimum pension corresponds to what the&#13;
average Q1 household spends monthly on food but only to 79 percent of its total monthly&#13;
expenditures. The average pension covers the total monthly expenditures of a Q2 family.&#13;
Therefore if the â&#128;&#156;averageâ&#128;&#157; pensionerâ&#128;&#153;s income consists only of the pension, the family&#13;
would fall below the poverty line. MOF pensions are more generous: the average monthly&#13;
pension paid by the MOF in 2009 was MT 3,728 (MT 3,130 to civil servants and MT 3,998 to&#13;

&amp;#12;the military), which is 75 percent more than the INSS average pension. The average civil and&#13;
military pensions cover 100 percent and 135 percent the total expenditures of a Q4 family&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
266.   In sum, Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s major social assistance programs are not generous. The PSA&#13;
transfers only cover a small share (24 percent) of the food requirements of the poorest&#13;
families. The generosity of the PSA is below the median for countries with similar programs.&#13;
Similarly, the minimum INSS pension only covers the basic food needs of the poorest&#13;
families but no other essential goods and services. Even the families of those receiving the&#13;
average INSS pension are likely to be below the poverty line if the pension is their only&#13;
source of income. The MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pensions are more generous as its retirees can afford&#13;
expenditures equivalent to Q4 households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.     Targeting and Selection Mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
267.   The major social assistance programs in Mozambique target their beneficiaries&#13;
based on categorical definitions. The PSA targets the elderly, those with chronic illnesses or&#13;
disabilities, and poor pregnant women who cannot work. The PASD provides short-term&#13;
support to poor people or households who experience some shock (such as a death, illness,&#13;
unemployment, or a house fire) as well as to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). Some&#13;
of the beneficiaries of INASâ&#128;&#153;s PBST and PGR are those that were beneficiaries of other&#13;
programs (such as the PSA) but who are now able to work. While most of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs&#13;
have set an income threshold to determine illegibility to participate, in practice this&#13;
requirement is not applied. Food-for-work programs beneficiaries are selected by&#13;
geographic targeting (for example, zones affected by disaster or arid and semi-arid areas)&#13;
and/or self-selection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              129&#13;
&amp;#12;268.    Beneficiary selection for INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs is made with the support of permanentes.&#13;
These are people from the local community who are trained by INAS to assess and process&#13;
applications, mobilize beneficiaries, and tell local beneficiaries when they will receive their&#13;
monthly cash payments. They also witness the distribution of payments made by INASâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
staff in their delegation or sub-delegation and can also collect and sign for payments for&#13;
beneficiaries who are unable to be present themselves on the payment date. Permanentes&#13;
are paid a monthly stipend of MT 500 (recently increased from MT 300). They are not&#13;
employees of INAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
269.    Benefit incidence analysis is helpful in evaluating the targeting efficiency of the&#13;
social assistance programs, or the extent to which the poor benefit from the programs. The&#13;
benefit incidence of a public program can be determined from a concentration curve, which&#13;
shows the share of total resources (vertical axis) going to percentages of the population&#13;
ranked by per capita consumption, income, or wealth (horizontal axis).153 A program in&#13;
which an equal amount of benefits is received by each quintile would have a straight 45&#13;
degree concentration line. A pro-poor program would be represented by a concentration&#13;
curve located above the 45 degree line curve. A program would be progressive if its&#13;
concentration curve is above the concentration curve of consumption. If the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
concentration curve lay between the diagonal and the consumptionâ&#128;&#153;s concentration curve,&#13;
then the program would not be pro-poor, although it would be progressive. If it lay below&#13;
the consumptionâ&#128;&#153;s concentration curve, it would not only not be pro-poor but it would also&#13;
be regressive in the sense that its distribution would be worse than the existing distribution&#13;
of consumption and thus would contribute to increasing inequity in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153&#13;
   Since the IOF 08/09 does not provide information on the amount of resources that each quintile receives&#13;
from the programs but only information on participation, it is assumed as customary in the analysis for these&#13;
type of programs that benefits are equally distributed among the participants. In this case benefit incidence&#13;
and beneficiary incidence are identical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     130&#13;
&amp;#12;270.   As this analysis is applied to programs in Mozambique, two caveats must be borne in&#13;
mind. As discussed in Chapter II, the distribution of consumption expenditures across&#13;
quintiles is quite flat in Mozambique, which means that reaching the poorest of the poor is&#13;
a greater targeting challenge in Mozambique than in countries where this group is more&#13;
easily identifiable. Second, the large share of population involved in the informal sector and&#13;
subsistence farming activities makes it more challenging to target on the basis of income or&#13;
consumption measures than in countries with larger formal sectors and monetized&#13;
economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
271.   In Mozambique, there is available information on the targeting outcomes for only&#13;
two assistance programs that can be considered to be designed to benefit the poor â&#128;&#146; the&#13;
PSA and the PSAD. However, while the primary objective of a program may not be&#13;
â&#128;&#156;targetingâ&#128;&#157; the poor, a concentration curve can be drawn to evaluate the extent to which&#13;
the poor are in fact accessing the program or to measure the share of the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
benefits that is received by the poorest quintiles. This type of analysis helps to understand&#13;
which groups might benefit from different public programs or subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
272.   Figure 4.2 depicts the concentration curves for the PSA and the PSAD constructed&#13;
with data from IOF 2008/09. The dotted line is the concentration curve (Lorenz curve) of&#13;
consumption. The concentration curves of these programs are above the consumption&#13;
concentration curve and therefore both are progressive. However, the concentration curves&#13;
move around the 45 degree line and by looking at the graph it is not possible to say whether&#13;
the programs are well targeted to the poor or are pro-poor (see below).&#13;

273.   Figure 4.3 depicts the concentration curves for the use of different kinds of health&#13;
facilities (public health centers or posts, public hospitals, and private clinics) by different&#13;
income groups, also constructed with information from IOF 2008/09. It shows that public&#13;
health centers and posts are mostly used by the poor as the concentration curve is above&#13;
the 45 degree line. Public hospitals, on the other hand, are mostly used by the non-poor&#13;
and are not pro-poor but are progressive (because the concentration curve is above the&#13;
consumption curve), while private clinics are not pro-poor and regressive. The policy&#13;
implication is that, to favor the poor, the government should concentrate its health&#13;
spending on health centers and health posts rather than on hospitals.&#13;

274.    The targeting accuracy of a program can be determined from the concentration&#13;
index. This index is calculated from the concentration curve in a similar way as the Gini&#13;
coefficient is calculated from the distribution of per capita consumption (or income).&#13;
Negative values of the concentration index indicate that a program is pro-poor. The larger&#13;
the index, in absolute terms, the more accurate is the program in reaching the poor. Figure&#13;
4.4 shows the concentration indices for the PSA, the PASD, the retirement pension, and&#13;
other programs for which there is information in the IOF 2008/09. It can be seen the PSA is&#13;
pro-poor while the PASD is not pro-poor but both are on the borderline between being pro-&#13;
poor and not pro-poor. The pension programs in general are not pro-poor, nor is having&#13;
access to university or using electricity or purchasing gasoline or diesel.154 On the other&#13;
hand, primary education and primary health care are clearly pro-poor.&#13;
&#13;

   This is based on the number of household members that responded that they had received a retirement&#13;
pension (uma pensÃ£o de reforma) the previous month and households that mentioned that they had paid for&#13;
the use of electricity and purchased gasoline or diesel during the last month.&#13;

&amp;#12;275.    To evaluate whether the program helps to improve equity, a progressivity index can&#13;
be calculated155. Table 4.14 presents the progressivity index for each program from the&#13;
most accurate program in reaching the poor (public health centers/posts) to the least&#13;
accurate in reaching the poor. As can be observed, there are several programs that are not&#13;
pro-poor and regressive. This implies that the distribution of benefits (access or use) is&#13;
worse than the existing distribution of consumption, meaning that it is aggravating existing&#13;
inequities. Indeed, it can be observed that the retirement pension program is not only not&#13;
pro-poor but also regressive as only 7 percent of those with a retirement pension are in the&#13;
two poorest quintiles while 74 percent are in the two richer quintiles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
276.    Summing up, and keeping in mind the caveats made at the beginning of this section,&#13;
the targeting accuracy of the two programs that are intended to reach the poor (the PSA&#13;
and the PASD) is poor. Therefore there is a need to improve the INASâ&#128;&#153;s beneficiary selection&#13;
mechanisms. Similarly, not only are the fuel subsidies not pro poor but they are actually&#13;
regressive and should be eliminated as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.      Cost-effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
277.    The administrative cost of the programs gives an indication of whether they are&#13;
cost-effective or not. Table 4.15 presents the administrative costs of different types of social&#13;
assistance programs from a variety of countries, as reported in a recent World Bank&#13;
study.156 As can be observed, the range of administrative costs is quite wide, which makes&#13;
comparisons difficult. Moreover, a program can have relatively high administrative costs&#13;
because of its small scale and its low benefits or because it is new and has high start-up&#13;
costs. On the other hand, a program may have low administrative costs because it does not&#13;
invest in key activities such as staff training, communications, auditing and controls,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
155&#13;
    Progressivity is equal to the programâ&#128;&#153;s concentration index minus the Gini coefficient of consumption. A&#13;
program that improves equity presents negative values in its progressivity index.&#13;

&amp;#12;information management, and monitoring and evaluation systems. As a result, the World&#13;
Bank study suggests developing an index of administrative expenditures to take some of&#13;
these aspects into consideration. The proposed index is calculated by multiplying the&#13;
generosity of program by the percentage of administrative costs in the total program&#13;
cost.157&#13;

278.       INASâ&#128;&#153;s assistance programs have high administrative costs. A 2008 study estimated&#13;
that the PSAâ&#128;&#153;s administrative costs in four INAA delegations (Maxixe, Nampula, Beira, and&#13;
Angoche) ranged from 32 percent to 50 percent of total costs.158 Another study conducted&#13;
in 2010 by the MMASâ&#128;&#153;s Administration and Finance Department in 13 INASâ&#128;&#153;s delegations&#13;
found that administrative costs averaged 38 percent of the total cost, ranging from 51&#13;
percent in Maxixe to 24 percent in Nampula.159 In Maxixe, it cost MT 1 to deliver MT 1 to&#13;
the beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
279.       Table 4.16 shows the administrative costs of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs. The data have to be&#13;
treated with caution because, as INAS has indicated, many of INASâ&#128;&#153;s staff work in more than&#13;
one program, which means that it is not easy to separate administrative costs by program.&#13;
The PSAâ&#128;&#153;s administrative costs averaged about 30 percent in the last three years. The World&#13;
Bank study reports the administrative costs of the Namibia Old age pension as being 9.5&#13;

280.        Following the procedure suggested by the World Bank study, an index of&#13;
administrative costs can be calculated for the PSA. Recall that PSA generosity was estimated&#13;
at 24 percent and that administrative costs as a percentage of total cost were 30.7 percent&#13;
in 2010 (Table 4.16). This yields an index of administrative costs of 7.4 (=24*0.307), which&#13;
compares with indices ranging from 0.5 to 2.25 with a median value of 1.1 for 10 social&#13;
assistance programs in various parts of the world for which information is reported in the&#13;
World Bank study.161 Consequently, it can be seen that the administrative costs of the PSA&#13;
are quite high by these standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;281.       Nor are other INAS programs cost-effective. The administrative costs of the PBST are&#13;
about 28 percent of total costs, those of the PGR are 19 percent, those of the PASD are 10&#13;
percent, and there is no information for the PDC. More important, however, is that these&#13;
programs do not achieve their objectives. A recent ILO study reviewed these programs in&#13;
detail and came to the following conclusions:162&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The Social Benefit for Work Program (PBST) is intended as a transitory program, with&#13;
           beneficiaries eventually getting a full-time job with their employers or setting&#13;
           themselves up in some other income-generating activities. However, partner&#13;
           employers do not fulfill their obligations in the program, meaning that the PBST does&#13;
           not achieve its aim to ensure that beneficiaries graduate from the program. INAS&#13;
           staff do not carry out a sufficient number of supervisory visits to beneficiaries. INAS&#13;
           has no mechanism for assessing whether the intended reduction in the level of&#13;
           beneficiaryâ&#128;&#153;s dependency is achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·   The Income Generation Program (PGR) also has a low success rate. Most income-&#13;
           generating projects funded by micro-credits provided by the PGR fail. The program&#13;
           has no clear graduation criteria. Beneficiaries are required to join in groups, most of&#13;
           which fail to make a success of their enterprises. Beneficiaries also do not repay the&#13;
           loans that they receive under the program. INAS plays an active role in&#13;
           implementing income-generating projects, but most INAS staff have no expertise in&#13;
           income generation.&#13;

&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   The Community Development Program (PDC) operates as a development program at&#13;
         the community level. It is based on a principle of community participation, not social&#13;
         assistance. There are no clear graduation criteria. The available data on the number&#13;
         of beneficiaries involves double counting because they assume that all members of a&#13;
         community benefit from each project in their community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
282.     INAS is fully aware of these problems. Indeed, as indicated in Chapter III, INAS has&#13;
recently suspended the PBST and the PDC while it considers how to better align existing&#13;
social assistance programs with the Basic Social Security Strategy (see Chapter V).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
283.     On the social security side, the INSS has suffered from serious governance and&#13;
management problems, including poor administrative, financial, and investment policies.&#13;
The World Bank and the ILO are helping the government to address these problems and to&#13;
reform the social security system (see Chapter V).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
284.     In sum, there is substantial room to increase the cost-effectiveness of Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
social protection programs and obtain more impact or â&#128;&#156;bang for the buck.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F.       Institutional and Coordination Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
285.     The MMAS has two National Directorates â&#128;&#146; the National Directorate for Social&#13;
Action (DNAS) and the National Directorate for Women (DNM). At the provincial level, it has&#13;
the Provincial Directorates of Women and Social Action (DPMAS), and it also has 128&#13;
District Services for Health, Women, and Social Action (DDMAS). The MMAS has identified&#13;
the following constraints to its operations: (i) the lack of qualified and trained staff; (ii) the&#13;
absence of infrastructure; (iii) the lack of equipment and material; (iv) the need for an&#13;
information system to support planning and monitoring and evaluation; and (v) the low&#13;
level of awareness in other sectors of the contribution that they could make to addressing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                139&#13;
&amp;#12;the needs of vulnerable groups.163 As of May 2011, the MMAS had 1,504 staff (859 of whom&#13;
were women), 13 percent in the central office and the remaining in 87 percent in the 11&#13;
provincial delegations. About one-quarter of its staff (23 percent) have only a primary&#13;
education or less, two-thirds have a secondary education, 8 percent have a licenciatura, five&#13;
people have a masters degree, and one has a doctoral degree.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
286.    INAS reports facing the following challenges: (i) a lack of trained staff in the&#13;
delegations including the weak technical capacity of staff in administration and finance; (ii)&#13;
a lack of resources to provide training to the delegation staff; (iii) a lack of transport to&#13;
support program activities; and (iv) poor facilities in some delegations.164 INAS indicates&#13;
that it has found it difficult to coordinate its 30 district delegations. It is seeking to establish&#13;
some hierarchy within these delegations to facilitate coordination. INAS has 944 staff, 9&#13;
percent at central offices and the remainder in its delegations. As of May 2011, INAS had&#13;
142 managers (21 at the central office), 330 operational staff (20 at the central office), and&#13;
the remainder being assistance staff. Of the 330 operational staff, 222 work in assistance&#13;
programs and 108 in development programs. Among these, there are 102 social workers, six&#13;
with a licenciatura, two with some higher education, two with specialized training, 76 with a&#13;
secondary education, and the remaining 16 with a primary education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
287.    There have been several studies that have explored how to improve the INAS&#13;
organization. The most recent study was financed by the UK Department for International&#13;
Development (DFID) in 2007. It highlighted the following critical issues: (i) a lack of a formal&#13;
organizational structure, (ii) inexplicit functional levels, (iii) unassigned responsibilities, (iv)&#13;
unclear reporting and delegation of authority, (v) undefined roles and duties, and (vi)&#13;
informal management styles.165&#13;

&amp;#12;288.   The ILO is supporting the development and implementation of a new management&#13;
information system for INAS, and UNICEF is helping to evaluate the impact of the PSA (see&#13;
Chapter V). Financial controls are being increased. An existing internal audit unit was&#13;
recently strengthened, and the budget management system e-SISTAFE is now in operation&#13;
in 11 of the 30 regional INAS offices (in all provincial capitals). Five districts in which INAS&#13;
operates still have no electricity, and therefore they cannot operate the e-SISTAFE. INAS is&#13;
working on a new organic scheme and a plan for staff development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
289.   Coordinating with other institutions remains a major challenge. According to INAS, in&#13;
the area of direct social assistance to vulnerable groups, for instance, there are many NGOs&#13;
and faith-based organizations working in Mozambique, mostly uncoordinated and&#13;
unregulated. Even within the government sector, INASâ&#128;&#153;s social assistance programs were&#13;
designed without any input from other sectors. For instance, under the auspices of the PDC&#13;
and at the request of the communities, INAS has helped to build schools and health posts,&#13;
even though these are activities that correspond to the Ministries of Education and Health.&#13;
As a result, this has often left INAS with no resources left over to financing its own social&#13;
assistance activities in those communities. In general, INASâ&#128;&#153;s social assistance and&#13;
development programs are not coordinated with any other health or education projects or&#13;
with training or microcredit institutions. There are no referral protocols in place so each&#13;
program functions like an island.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
290.   In sum, the MMAS and INAS are in need of substantial institutional strengthening,&#13;
particularly now that heavy demands are being placed on them for the development and&#13;
implementation of the National Strategy of Basic Social Security (ENSSB). There is still is a&#13;
lack of coordination across sectors, with most programs unable to exploit the synergies that&#13;
could be generated from closer coordination in program design and implementation.&#13;
Coordinating interventions also remains a challenge at the local level because there is no&#13;
clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the different actors. In general, there is a&#13;
lack of a clear system of incentives and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               141&#13;
&amp;#12;G.         Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
291.       There have been some positive developments as Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s public sector&#13;
gradually develops a culture of results-oriented management and a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (M&amp;E) system. To monitor the implementation and impact of PARPA I, a M&amp;E&#13;
system was developed. A short version of this framework known as the Performance&#13;
Assessment Framework is used to monitor general budget support. The PARPA is evaluated&#13;
by means of mid-year and annual joint donor reviews and a final impact evaluation&#13;
(RelatÃ³rio de AvaliaÃ§Ã£o de Impacto) that assesses progress in each of the pillars and in the&#13;
cross-cutting thematic areas. The Joint Review (RevisÃ£o Conjunta) is the mechanism through&#13;
which the government, donors, and civil society evaluate the implementation of PARPA.166&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
292.       The GOM budget is being prepared on a programmatic basis and is becoming more&#13;
closely linked to the various planning instruments such as the Five-Year Government&#13;
Program (Programa Quinquenal do Governo, or PQG) and the Annual Economic and Social&#13;
Plans. A major effort was made during the 2007 to 2009 period to develop program&#13;
budgeting, and since then a technical group comprising staff from the Ministry of Planning&#13;
and Development and the Ministry of Finance has been formed to steer the process.167 The&#13;
execution of the state budget is monitored quarterly and annually by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance through the State Budget Execution Report (RelatÃ³rio de ExecuÃ§Ã£o do OrÃ§amento&#13;
do Estado); externally it is audited by the Administrative Tribunal, which publishes the&#13;
Consolidated State Accounts (Conta Geral do Estado).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
293.       The Ministry of Finance has strengthened its district offices to decentralize budget&#13;
preparation and execution at the district level using the e-SISTAFE system. Under the&#13;
current decentralized system, the Treasury releases amounts in response to demands from&#13;
the sectors regarding the extent and timing of their needs. This is the case for both current&#13;

&amp;#12;and investment expenditures. According to the MOF, the weekly requests are reliable and&#13;
reflect real sector needs.168&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
294.     Despite the progress made in recent years in developing M&amp;E in Mozambique,&#13;
weaknesses remain because of the continued existence of a multitude of processes and&#13;
methodologies. At the central level, three distinct systems exist for monitoring and&#13;
evaluating the Economic and Social Plan (PES), PARPA, and the Sectoral Strategic Plans. The&#13;
system to monitor the execution of the PES is the most entrenched at all levels of&#13;
government and has been a major source of information for this study. These national&#13;
systems are in turn supported by a multitude of sectoral and provincial systems that have&#13;
no consistent methodology or standardization.169&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
295.     At the program level, very few interventions count with adequate information and&#13;
an M&amp;E system, most of which are pilot programs financed by donors. A major initiative&#13;
directly related to social protection is the impact evaluation of the PSA being conducted&#13;
with UNICEF support. It began with a baseline survey in 2008 and continued with a follow-&#13;
up survey in 2009 and is designed to measure over time differences in a range of social and&#13;
economic indicators between a group of new beneficiaries and a control group.170&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
296.     In sum, the development of a culture of evidence-based policymaking and&#13;
management by results is a process that requires continued commitment and effort from&#13;
the GOM and investment in information and M&amp;E systems and staff training.&#13;

&amp;#12;H.     Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
297.   Mozambique is a poor country and will continue to require foreign support for many&#13;
years to come. About 45 percent of the GOM budget is financed by external resources, one-&#13;
third of which are grants (15 percent of the budget). Mozambique currently has 19 Partners&#13;
of Programmatic Support (Parceiros de Apoio ProgramÃ¡tico), which have disbursed over&#13;
US$400 million in each of the last three years to support the GOM budget. These partners&#13;
stipulate that at least 65 percent of the budget resources must be allocated to agriculture,&#13;
rural development, infrastructure (roads, water, and sanitation), good governance, and&#13;
other priority areas for reducing absolute poverty, including social assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
298.   As discussed above, external resources finances about two-thirds of basic social&#13;
security, with 54 percent of external financing going to Education Social Action, 19 percent&#13;
to Direct Social Action, 19 percent to Health Social Action, and 8 percent to Productive&#13;
Social Action. While external resources finance one-third of Direct Social Action, they&#13;
finance two-thirds of Education Social Action, 90 percent of Health Social Action, and 69&#13;
percent of Productive Social Action. This heavy dependence on external resources raises the&#13;
question of whether these programs are sustainable over the longer term and points to the&#13;
need to use existing resources in the most efficient and effective way possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
299.   Subsidies are a sensitive issue in all countries and Mozambique is no exception. The&#13;
GOM is fully aware that they are absorbing large amount of resources (one-third of total&#13;
social protection spending) and are crowding out other programs that could be better&#13;
targeted to the poorest Mozambicans. As subsidies are being rationalized, it is hoped that&#13;
greater fiscal space will become available for social assistance programs. At the same time,&#13;
the GOM should continue to rationalize social assistance programs to increase the efficiency&#13;
of resource use and to reform the pension system to ensure its longer-term financial&#13;
viability (see Chapter V). The GOM recognizes that, while â&#128;&#156;foreign aid flows are still high,&#13;
they are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and may decrease in real terms over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              144&#13;
&amp;#12;medium term. To address this uncertainty, it is essential that the State continues in the&#13;
coming years its efforts to increase internal revenue collections and be able to cope with a&#13;
possible fall in external aid and continues to invest in priority areas for combating&#13;
poverty.â&#128;&#157;171&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.         Summary Assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
300.       The Mozambique social protection system is a â&#128;&#156;work in progress.â&#128;&#157; On the basis of&#13;
the foregoing analysis, it can be concluded that, while Mozambique has programs to&#13;
address most of the risks identified in this report, there are still major gaps. Poor families&#13;
with children are not adequately supported, there is no significant youth program, and&#13;
subsistence farmers and other workers are not properly protected against recurrent shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
301.       While Mozambique spends a considerable amount of its resources on social&#13;
protection, most are absorbed by untargeted subsidies and MOF pensions that benefit only&#13;
a few but absorb about one-third of total social protection spending. In contrast, relatively&#13;
little is spent on young children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
302.       The major social assistance programs and the pension plan for the private sector&#13;
have limited coverage and generosity. There is program fragmentation and duplication and&#13;
many uncoordinated activities that diminish the programsâ&#128;&#153; impact. The targeting accuracy&#13;
of the two programs that are intended to reach the poor (the PSA and the PASD) is weak.&#13;
Also, the major programs are not cost-effective. The PSA has very high administrative costs&#13;
and the so-called â&#128;&#156;developmentalâ&#128;&#157; programs of INAS are also not cost-effective. Moreover,&#13;
potential synergies among the social assistance programs are not exploited. Table 4.17&#13;
summarizes the major findings of this assessment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
303.    The Government of Mozambique has taken important steps in the last few years to&#13;
put in place a framework to strengthen the social protection system. As mentioned in&#13;
Chapter I, in 2007, the GOM approved Law No 4/2007 on Social Protection, which&#13;
established three levels of protection: (i) basic social protection; (ii) compulsory social&#13;
protection; and (iii) complementary social protection. In 2009 it approved the Regulations&#13;
of the Basic Social Protection System (Decree 85/2009) and, in the early 2010, the National&#13;
Strategy of Basic Social Security (ENSSB), which consists of four components: (i) direct social&#13;
action; (ii) education social action; (iii) health social action; and (iv) productive social action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
304.    This legal and policy framework is very much in keeping with the current&#13;
international best practice (Table 5.1). Indeed, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s forthcoming Social&#13;
Protection Strategy for 2012-22 calls for building social protection systems rather than just a&#13;
collection of social assistance and insurance programs. It also specifies that these systems&#13;
should provide three basic functions:172&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
172&#13;
    In general terms, prevention is the equivalent of risk mitigation in the SRM framework discussed in Chapter&#13;
I, protection is equivalent to coping, and promotion to risk reduction (Samson et al, 2006, p. 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     147&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   Prevention against drops in well-being from income and expenditure shocks. In the&#13;
    social protection domain, prevention is usually achieved through social insurance&#13;
    programs â&#128;&#147; such as unemployment and disability insurance, old age pensions, and&#13;
    scalable public works programsâ&#128;&#147; that lessen the impact of shocks on individuals and&#13;
    families and enable them to smooth their consumption over their lifecycles. But&#13;
    complementary programs â&#128;&#147; such as crop and weather insurance and health&#13;
    insurance â&#128;&#147; are also extremely important for prevention. This corresponds roughly&#13;
    to risk mitigation under the social risk management (SRM) approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Protection from destitution and catastrophic losses of human capital. Social&#13;
    assistance programs (including cash transfers, school feeding, and targeted food&#13;
    assistance and subsidies) protect poor individuals and families from irreversible and&#13;
    catastrophic losses of human capital (by withdrawing children from school or&#13;
    foregoing health care), which is essential for both individual wellbeing and broader&#13;
    economic growth. At the same time, these programs reduce the socioeconomic&#13;
    harm caused by acute inequality. This parallels the risk coping under the SRM&#13;
    approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Promotion of improved opportunities and livelihoods, notably by connecting&#13;
    individuals with better jobs. Institutions that promote opportunity are often&#13;
    integrated with those supporting prevention and protection. Labor market&#13;
    activation programs provide unemployment benefits while building workersâ&#128;&#153; skills to&#13;
    increase their employability. Conditional cash transfers give recipients an incentive&#13;
    to invest in their human capital by encouraging demand for education and health&#13;
    and help to reduce gender inequalities. And public works programs provide workers&#13;
    with cash payments for building and rehabilitating vital infrastructure, thus investing&#13;
    in both human and physical capital. Equally important for promotion are the indirect&#13;
    effects of preventive and protective programs. By reducing householdsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          148&#13;
&amp;#12;           vulnerability, they allow them to be more innovative and to take productive risks.&#13;
           This relates to risk reduction under the SRM approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
305.       According to the World Bank, social protection systems enhance equity (by providing&#13;
individuals with the means to secure their rights and to deliver on their obligations),&#13;
efficiency (through better designed tax/financing arrangements, economies of scale, and&#13;
common platforms such as registries), and effectiveness (through harmonized incentives&#13;
and fewer unintended consequence on behavior). Ideally, these systems would be&#13;
characterized by a mix of public and private providers depending on the extent to which&#13;
private institutions are providing socially desirable levels of protection, prevention, and&#13;
promotion in any given country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
306.       The complexity of building social protection systems should not be underestimated.&#13;
It entails many different actors, preferences, programs, policies, instruments, institutions,&#13;
and financing and often requires policymakers to make difficult trade-offs. Therefore, the&#13;
pace at which a social protection system can be built must depend on the specific&#13;
institutional and financial conditions and capabilities of the country in question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
307.       In Mozambique, following the Namaachaâ&#128;&#153;s workshop in May 2011, the MMAS and&#13;
INAS have developed a proposal to restructure their programs.173 The proposal establishes&#13;
four areas of intervention: (i) monetary transfers for an unlimited time that will comprise a&#13;
Program of Basic Social Subsidies (Programa de Subsidio Social BÃ¡sico) based on an&#13;
expanded PSA; (ii) monetary transfers for limited time that will include the Program de&#13;
Apoio Social Directo (PASD) divided into an ad hoc component and a long-term support&#13;
component; (iii) social assistance services for vulnerable and abandoned children, elderly&#13;
people, victims of violence, and the homeless that will include a Program of Institutional&#13;
Attention (public nurseries/kindergartens and support centers for the elderly, the&#13;
&#13;
173&#13;
      Ministry of Women and Social Assistance (2011b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         149&#13;
&amp;#12;handicapped, and repatriate) and a Program of Family Orientation and Reunification; and&#13;
(iv) productive social action in the form of a labor-intensive public works program and a&#13;
component of support to the Development of Income Generation Activities Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
308.   The MMAS/INAS proposal, which was recently approved by the Cabinet, is an&#13;
important step towards developing a vision of an integrated social protection system in&#13;
Mozambique that: (i) responds effectively and flexibly not only to existing risks but also to&#13;
shocks; (ii) exploits synergies between programs and is based on shared operational&#13;
platforms to increase programsâ&#128;&#153; impact and cost-effectiveness; and (iii) includes a unified&#13;
social insurance program, rationalized social assistance programs, effective labor market&#13;
programs, and closer links between programs and social and productive services. The&#13;
discussion in this study suggests that it will be necessary to address three mutually&#13;
complimentary issues in order to achieve this vision: developing effective mechanisms and&#13;
processes to maximize the impact of SP interventions in terms of reducing poverty;&#13;
rationalizing public expenditures while filling existing program gaps; and strengthening&#13;
institutional arrangements. It is also important to keep in mind that the most important&#13;
strategy for reducing the vulnerability and poverty of Mozambican families, which is the&#13;
major objective of the social protection system, is to continue to pursue growth-oriented,&#13;
job-creating, pro-poor policies. Having a stable job that pays a reasonable wage is the main&#13;
way for individuals and their households to rise out of or avoid falling into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
309.   Given its capacity and resources limitations, the GOM should address these issues in&#13;
three stages. In the first stage, the GOM could focus on: (i) consolidating the basic social&#13;
assistance system by restructuring the PSA (into a new Basic Social Subsidy Program),&#13;
implementing a labor-intensive public works program that will help the poor to survive&#13;
during the lean season and will fill part of the programmatic gap, and strengthening the&#13;
traditional social services; (ii) improving processes and mechanisms (by creating a new&#13;
operational platform) to increase the cost-effectiveness of interventions; and (iii) deepening&#13;
the social security reforms. In the second stage, the GOM should consider introducing an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              150&#13;
&amp;#12;unconditional transfer program for poor families with children (particularly for labor-poor&#13;
families) to fill the other part of the programmatic gap. This program and the PSA transfer&#13;
program would both be based on the new operational platform and would be linked with&#13;
education, health, and other related services and with public works, training programs, and&#13;
other income-generation activities. The third stage would focus on evaluating the new&#13;
programs, tightening the links between programs and services, and strengthening&#13;
coordination mechanisms with NGOs. Reducing program fragmentation and duplication&#13;
should be a goal during all three stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     First Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
310.   During this first stage the focus should be on consolidating the basic social assistance&#13;
system and implementing a labor-intensive public works program that will help the poor to&#13;
survive during the lean season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     Consolidating the Basic Social Assistance System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
311.   Consolidating the basic social assistance system should be done gradually. The focus&#13;
of social action activities should be a combination of the Basic Social Subsidy Program and&#13;
the Productive Social Action Program. The former would be a reformed and enhanced PSA,&#13;
while the latter would consist of a labor-intensive public works program. It is expected that&#13;
these two programs will account for over 80 percent of the social assistance budget during&#13;
the first few years of this stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
312.   A strategic combination of public works programs and cash transfers would provide&#13;
vulnerable groups with access to productive, income-generating activities and to social&#13;
services. The public works would provide vulnerable groups with seasonal work and a&#13;
predictable source of income, thus helping them to smooth their consumption and avoid&#13;
the need to make negative investment decisions (such as selling off their assets or eating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             151&#13;
&amp;#12;less food) while also improving their wellbeing. In the medium term, participation in public&#13;
works program is expected to help vulnerable households to accumulate assets, thus&#13;
making it more feasible for them to adopt more productive income-generating activities.&#13;
The reformed PSA would continue to be a permanent intervention implemented&#13;
throughout the year, albeit with some adjustments to its targeting mechanisms and to the&#13;
controls over the disbursement of funds. Gradually, it may be possible to make both&#13;
interventions linked on the use by beneficiary households of education, health, and&#13;
nutrition services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
313.   Consolidating the basic social assistance system would involve adjusting and&#13;
consolidating the PSA, scaling up the labor-intensive public works program, and&#13;
strengthening social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a.     Basic Social Subsidy Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
314.   The Basic Social Benefit, which will build on the existing Food Subsidy Program, will&#13;
have a greater focus on children as the indirect beneficiaries (as dependents) of this&#13;
transfer. Only those households that include no able-bodied people of working age and&#13;
have no other source of support (such as pensions) will be eligible. The level of the transfer&#13;
will be reviewed to ensure effectiveness of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
315.   The transfer, which will be allocated by household, will consist of a baseline amount&#13;
plus 25 percent for each dependent up to a maximum of four dependents. This formula is&#13;
used to ensure that the minimum needs of each individual are met, using as proxy&#13;
estimates of the IOF, in its approach to poverty lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              152&#13;
&amp;#12;b.     Implementing a Labor-intensive Public Works Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
316.   INASâ&#128;&#153;s Public Works Program with Intensive Use of Manpower, which is being&#13;
developed by the GOM with the support of the World Bank, is one of the main interventions&#13;
of the Productive Social Action pillar of the Basic Social Assistance Strategy. This is expected&#13;
to be supplemented by other programs related to income generation in the second stage of&#13;
the reform. Its target population is the chronically food-insecure whose situation is&#13;
aggravated periodically by droughts and floods as well as the able-bodied unemployed. The&#13;
objective is to stabilize income and to reduce vulnerability to future shocks by providing&#13;
monetary transfers in exchange for temporary work. The program will be implemented&#13;
during the dry season or during other times when rural workers cannot find work in&#13;
agriculture and when food insecurity is higher. In urban areas, this seasonal aspect of food&#13;
security does not exist, but certain types of work need to be performed at certain times of&#13;
the year (for example, drainage ditches need to be cleaned around February/March).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c.     Strengthening Social Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
317.   It is important to keep in mind that, when new social assistance programs are&#13;
implemented, there is a danger of crowding out resources for the traditional social services,&#13;
which serve abandoned children, orphans, foster children and other children in the care of&#13;
the state, the disabled, the homeless, and the indigent elderly. These programs are the&#13;
foundation of social protection and should always be given a high priority by the&#13;
government. In Mozambique these programs include the social services provided by the&#13;
MMAS, residential care for needy children, the elderly, and the disabled provided by INASâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Unidades Sociais, and the (ad hoc) emergency assistance by INASâ&#128;&#153;s Direct Social Assistance&#13;
Program. The GOM is also responsible for regulating the provision of these services by the&#13;
private sector, NGOs, and faith-based organizations. Therefore, these programs and&#13;
services should be adequately resourced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              153&#13;
&amp;#12;2.         Establishing a New Operational Platform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
318.       The ILO and INAS have signed an agreement recently to develop and implement a&#13;
new management information system (MIS). This will create a unified central beneficiary&#13;
database (registry) and will help to improve the management of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs. This is a&#13;
very important development. The MIS will be based in Maputo, with access to all of the 30&#13;
INAS delegations, and will benefit from the most recent IT, communication, and safety and&#13;
safeguard technologies. The applications will be web based. The system will cover five&#13;
processes: system management; beneficiary management; subsidies payment&#13;
management; subsidies finance management; and statistical reports management. Each&#13;
process is subdivided into sub-processes as follows:174&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      System management: create/update user profiles and entity profiles; analyze requests&#13;
       from users and update user access levels; access control and tracking; update system&#13;
       parameters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Beneficiary management: register demand for subsidies and create beneficiary profiles;&#13;
       verify beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; identification; analyze subsidy demand and waiting list&#13;
       management; update beneficiary profiles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Subsidies payment management: generate reports on the payment of subsidies by&#13;
       delegations and by paying agents; manage the budgeting process; obtain cash, verify&#13;
       subsidies report, and provide cash to paying agent; distribute subsidies and control&#13;
       payments; gather data on changes in beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Subsidies finance management: prepare budget request for subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
174&#13;
      ILO (2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                154&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   Report management: generate statistical reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
319.   The reformed PSA will use this new platform. In addition, INAS should review its&#13;
targeting and beneficiary selection mechanisms, payment mechanisms, grievance and&#13;
appeal processes, program recertification and exit rules, and program monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
320.   Targeting and Beneficiary Selection. In a country like Mozambique with widespread&#13;
poverty and a flat distribution of poverty among the lowest three or four quintiles, it is very&#13;
difficult to use income/consumption criteria to target the neediest. As discussed, the&#13;
beneficiaries of INASâ&#128;&#153;s programs are selected by means of referrals from the local&#13;
authorities and the permanentes, which has led to significant inclusion and exclusion errors&#13;
in both the PSA and PASD. Improving targeting will require selecting a clearly identifiable&#13;
target group, setting clear and realistic eligibility criteria, and adopting selection&#13;
mechanisms that minimize errors of inclusion. If the authorities feel that the existing&#13;
selection mechanism can be improved, then they must identify its current weak points and&#13;
correct them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
321.   An alternative way to select beneficiaries of long-term transfers is to involve the&#13;
local community in selecting the beneficiary families. Combining geographical, community,&#13;
and categorical selection can minimize exclusion and inclusion errors. This could be done in&#13;
two steps. First, the GOM would identify the poorest districts in the country and within this&#13;
the poorest communities using an impartial and transparent method. In many countries,&#13;
the poorest districts and communities are identified by means of poverty or food insecurity&#13;
maps. Second, each community council would be asked to identify those whom the council&#13;
believes to be eligible for the program. The number of beneficiaries selected could be&#13;
directly related to the size of the community (number of families) and to the overall number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               155&#13;
&amp;#12;of beneficiaries to be included in the program. For some programs such as the social&#13;
pension, selection would include everyone within the community who fit the criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
322.   Payments. Currently, the PSAâ&#128;&#153;s payments are supposed to be made monthly though&#13;
in some cases INAS is not able to keep to the schedule for various reasons. Payments could&#13;
be made bi-monthly to cut back on administrative costs and to ensure that beneficiaries can&#13;
rely on receiving the benefit on time. INAS should continue to explore ways of reducing the&#13;
cost of making and collecting payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
323.   Grievances and Appeal Mechanisms. All programs should have grievance and appeal&#13;
procedures, for example, for those applicants who believe that they have been incorrectly&#13;
ruled as ineligible for the program or that they are receiving an incorrect amount. There&#13;
should also be procedures for reporting program fraud or other irregularities. All potential&#13;
beneficiaries should be given information on their rights and obligations with regard to&#13;
recertification, continued eligibility, exiting the program, and how to file a complaint or&#13;
appeal. Those individuals chosen to hear the appeals should be completely independent&#13;
from those managing the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
324.   Recertification and Exit. The unified registry of beneficiaries will make it possible for&#13;
program administrators to keep track of any changes in the circumstances of the&#13;
beneficiaries. This will enable them to take them off the payment list if they are no longer&#13;
eligible and to avoid making payments to â&#128;&#156;ghostâ&#128;&#157; beneficiaries. Having a process of periodic&#13;
recertification of beneficiaries also makes it possible for new eligible applicants to be&#13;
accepted into the program. How often recertification ought to take place will depend on,&#13;
inter alia, the objectives of the program, the eligibility requirements, and how quickly&#13;
eligibility status (such as poverty, nutritional status, or illness) may change, and the costs of&#13;
implementing the recertification process. The rules for exiting all programs should be clearly&#13;
established and enforced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               156&#13;
&amp;#12;325.       Monitoring and Evaluation. UNICEF is currently conducting an impact evaluation of&#13;
the PSA. In a 2008 baseline survey and a follow-up survey in 2009, it tracked a group of new&#13;
beneficiaries and a control group to measure differences between them in a range of social&#13;
and economic indicators.175 Building on this initiative, the GOM should ensure that all major&#13;
social assistance programs should be monitored for implementation progress and be&#13;
evaluated for their impact on a regular basis. Strong and credible monitoring and evaluation&#13;
systems yield essential information that can increase the programâ&#128;&#153;s cost-effectiveness and&#13;
improve its performance.176 The development of this kind of a culture of management by&#13;
results will require continued commitment and effort from the MMAS and INAS authorities&#13;
as well as investment in information systems and staff training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.         Reforming Social Security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
326.       Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s pension system has several significant shortcomings including&#13;
fragmentation, the low coverage and modest benefits of the INSS, and increasing public&#13;
expenditure on the MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pensions. The GOM has begun to reform the social security&#13;
system with the support of the World Bank and ILO with the aim of slowly reducing&#13;
fragmentation and merging the existing plans over the longer term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
327.       The World Bank is helping to reform the MOFâ&#128;&#153;s pension plans, including by&#13;
conducting functional and actuarial studies. ILO is supporting the reform of the INSS to&#13;
ensure its long-term financial viability. So far the INSS has revised its investment portfolio&#13;
and is developing an investment strategy. It is improving the way in which it registers its&#13;
contributors and is strengthening collection methods. It is also conducting an actuarial study&#13;
based on the audited accounts of 2004-08, and it plans to reform its organizational&#13;
structure and introduce a modern management information system (MIS). In addition, the&#13;
INSS should aim to increase its coverage of the labor force. The priority should be to ensure&#13;

&amp;#12;that all private sector firms contribute to the system and delinquency rates are reduced.&#13;
Next it should seek to cover the self-employed, initially by concentrating on the easier-to-&#13;
reach organized professional groups such as lawyers or engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       Second Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
328.     In this stage, the authorities should focus on complementing the revamped PSA&#13;
transfer program for the elderly poor and others unable to work (social pension) with a&#13;
transfer program for poor families with children, both based on the new operational&#13;
platform. They should also link these transfer programs with education, health, and other&#13;
social services and link labor-intensive public works programs with training, credit,&#13;
insurance, and other financial services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       Social Pensions and Transfers to Families with Children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
329.     The MMAS and INAS propose dividing the PASD into two interventions: a short-&#13;
term, ad hoc transfer for families and a long-term transfer (Apoio Prolongado) for specific&#13;
groups such as families with children with nutritional deficiencies, child-headed households,&#13;
the chronically ill (bed-ridden) and women heads of household who are temporarily unable&#13;
to work. However, we recommend that this long-term component should be included as&#13;
part of a new transfer using the PSA operational platform. Specifically, we recommend that&#13;
the GOM consider developing two unconditional cash transfers based on the common PSA&#13;
operational platform (see the first stage) and filling the other programmatic gap as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Social Pension (PensÃ£o Social) for the elderly poor who have no children in their&#13;
         household, the disabled, and the chronically ill who are unable to work and have no&#13;
         pensions or other source of income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               158&#13;
&amp;#12;   ï&#130;·   Support to Children (Apoio as CrianÃ§as) for poor families (particularly labor-poor&#13;
       families) with children aged 0 to 17 years and child-headed households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
330.   Target Groups. The first target group is already being covered by PSA. It is&#13;
estimated that there are 305,372 people aged 60 and over in the poorest quintile and&#13;
497,800 people aged 60 and over in the two poorest quintiles. The number of the elderly as&#13;
well as other potential beneficiaries (people with chronic diseases, unable to work, and&#13;
living without children) would need to be determined. The second target group is poor&#13;
families with children (particularly labor-poor families such as those with a single earner, a&#13;
high dependency ratio, or partial or temporary incapacities) or child-headed households.&#13;
The aim of targeting these groups would be to break the inter-generational transmission of&#13;
poverty by increasing poor familiesâ&#128;&#153; access to food, health, education, and other services.&#13;
OVC should be included in this group rather than being treated as a separate group, and&#13;
priority should be given to households headed by children. The elderly who live with&#13;
children should also be included in this group as well as poor pregnant women. It is&#13;
estimated that there are about 2.8 million children between the ages of 0 and 17 in the&#13;
poorest quintile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
331.   Benefit Level. The benefit of the program should be consistent with its objectives.&#13;
The Social Pension should provide an amount sufficient to buy a meaningful share of the&#13;
beneficiaryâ&#128;&#153;s food needs. The transfer to poor families with children should provide&#13;
additional resources to improve the childrenâ&#128;&#153;s nutritional status, health, and educational&#13;
attainment. Two concerns are at play here. One is whether the transfer undermines existing&#13;
informal coping arrangements instead of complementing them. The other concern is what&#13;
some authors have called â&#128;&#156;leap-froggingâ&#128;&#157; when the transfer makes beneficiary families&#13;
richer than their neighbors, thus creating tension within the community. This could be a real&#13;
problem in many communities given that, as discussed, the distribution of consumption is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              159&#13;
&amp;#12;quite flat in Mozambique. This problem can be minimized by keeping the transfer as low as&#13;
consistent with achieving its objective and providing other benefits in kind (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
332.   The Social Pension should cover a significant share of the cost of the actualized Q1&#13;
food basket and should be periodically actualized. The transfer to families with children&#13;
should include this base amount plus an additional amount for each child up to a given limit&#13;
on the number of children to take into account economies of scale and avoid unwanted&#13;
incentives, like those that exist in the current PSA system. It is important to stress that the&#13;
difference between what is being suggested and the existing PSA is that the reformed&#13;
version would clearly identify the target groups (families with children and people in need&#13;
of a social pension), would focus on families with children, and would ensure that&#13;
complementary services are made available to break the inter-generational transmission of&#13;
poverty by leveraging transfers and investment in human capital (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.     Establishing Links between Transfers and Other Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
333.   The Social Pension and the Support to Children transfer programs should establish&#13;
close links with education, health, and other services (e.g., birth registry). Indeed, under&#13;
Decree 85/09 (Articles 11-14) which regulates the Basic Social Security Subsystem it is&#13;
already contemplated that poor people should have free access to several services. The&#13;
Decree declares that health services must be provided free to pregnant women, children&#13;
under the age of 5, the elderly, the disabled, and people with chronic diseases or suffering&#13;
from HIV/AIDS, leprosy, or tuberculosis. On education, it reiterates that primary education&#13;
is free to all children (who also have access to free textbooks) and that children in need&#13;
should have access to school lunches and get support for educational materials. In Article 2,&#13;
the Regulation states that this provision will materialize â&#128;&#156;gradually, taking into account the&#13;
economic conditions of the country.â&#128;&#157; To ensure that there are synergies between all social&#13;
programs and services in Mozambique, the beneficiaries of the Social Pension and the&#13;
Support to Children programs should be automatically eligible for free health services (and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              160&#13;
&amp;#12;medicine) and for free primary schooling, textbooks, uniforms, school materials, and (when&#13;
available) school lunches as well as for free birth registration when required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
334.       Given existing institutional limitations and resource constraints, these efforts to&#13;
strengthen the links between the unconditional transfer programs and education, health,&#13;
and other services should be made initially in a selected number of districts or communities&#13;
where significant improvements can be made in the existing health and education services&#13;
that can gradually be extended to the rest of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
335.       Communication is very important for achieving the objectives of the Support for&#13;
Children unconditional cash transfer. Each community should be fully briefed on the&#13;
purpose of the program. Communities should help ensure that the families that are selected&#13;
as beneficiaries are those that are most in need and that families headed by children, OVC,&#13;
children with nutritional problems, and poor pregnant women are included. Furthermore,&#13;
the beneficiary families must be made aware of what is expected of them â&#128;&#147; that the diet of&#13;
the family must improve and that the children must attend school and visit health clinics&#13;
regularly. This will require trained staff and resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.         Developing Links with Labor-intensive Public Works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
336.       Policymakers should establish close links between the labor-intensive public works&#13;
program and other services and programs that can help its beneficiaries to rise out of&#13;
poverty. A recent DFID study stressed the need to focus on helping the poorest to rise out&#13;
of poverty.177 It suggested that the program should not only provide beneficiaries&#13;
predictable transfers in return for their labor but also include training or technical&#13;
assistance so that beneficiaries can improve or develop their skills. These services may also&#13;
include a savings component combined with financial literacy training. Once beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 161&#13;
&amp;#12;financial literacy is assured, microcredit for agricultural production or income-generating&#13;
activities can gradually be introduced. This microcredit component can build on the&#13;
experience of Village Savings and Loan Associations in which groups of women provide&#13;
collateral for each other to take out small loans while learning about savings, credit, and&#13;
running a small enterprise.178 It may also include some simple form of micro-insurance&#13;
added directly to the savings element (perhaps consisting of life insurance and funeral&#13;
expenses). Again the program may build on pre-existing forms of mutual insurance such as&#13;
funeral associations.179 It is important to stress that all of these services should be provided&#13;
by specialized agencies and that the MMAS and INAS should not try to duplicate these&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.          Third Stage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
337.        In the third stage, the GOM should evaluate the new programs, make any&#13;
corrections suggested by the evaluations, expand the successful interventions to reach as&#13;
many eligible beneficiaries as resources permit, and tighten the links with other programs&#13;
and services. Coordination with the NGOs should be strengthened, and the fragmentation&#13;
and duplication of interventions reduced even further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.          Institutional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
338.        To implement all the activities contemplated in the three stages, it will be necessary&#13;
for the MMAS and INAS to be substantially strengthened. Several studies have revealed&#13;
some of the organizational weaknesses of the MMAS and INAS. Some measures have been&#13;
implemented to address INASâ&#128;&#153;s weaknesses. For example, financial controls are being&#13;
improved. An existing internal audit unit was recently strengthened, and the budget&#13;
management system e-SISTAFE is now operating in 11 of INAS 30 regional offices (in all&#13;

                                                 162&#13;
&amp;#12;provincial capitals). As discussed, the ILO is supporting INAS in developing and&#13;
implementing a new MIS. INAS is also working on a new organization scheme and a plan for&#13;
staff development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
339.   There are many plans and coordinating bodies in Mozambique, but there is still a&#13;
lack of coordination across sectors, with most programs unable to exploit the synergies that&#13;
could be generated from closer coordination in designing and implementing programs. At&#13;
the local level, this is a challenge because of the absence of clear definitions of the roles of&#13;
the different actors. There is a need to establish clear roles and responsibilities for all those&#13;
involved in program implementation as well as an appropriate system of incentives and&#13;
accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
340.   The Decree that regulates the basic social security sub-system (Decree No. 85/2009)&#13;
in Article 5 also created the Council for the Coordination of the Basic Social Security&#13;
Subsystem. This inter-sectoral body comprises the ministries that oversee Direct Social&#13;
Action (MMAS), Education Social Action (the Ministry of Education), Health Social Action&#13;
(the Ministry of Health), and those that oversee Productive Social Action (the Ministries of&#13;
Planning and Development, Agriculture, Labor, Public Works and Housing, and State&#13;
Administration) as well as the private and public entities involved in providing social&#13;
assistance. The Council is mandated to coordinate the implementation of the basic social&#13;
security sub-system. It has the potential to play an important role in coordinating programs&#13;
across sectors and in creating the synergies necessary to leverage resources and increase&#13;
the effectiveness of social protection interventions. Therefore, it should be established as&#13;
soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               163&#13;
&amp;#12;341.   Social protection information also needs to be improved. All major social assistance&#13;
programs should have adequate management and M&amp;E systems. INASâ&#128;&#153;s budget should&#13;
include all of its program expenditures instead of these being buried under General State&#13;
Obligations as is currently the case. Future household surveys should include questions that&#13;
would yield the necessary information to evaluate the incidence of the major social&#13;
assistance programs.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This assessment shows that Mozambique social protection system is developing. While&#13;
programs to address most of the risks identified exist, there are still major gaps. Poor families&#13;
with children are not adequately supported, there is no significant youth program, and&#13;
subsistence farmers and other workers are not properly protected against recurrent shocks.&#13;
The government spends a considerable amount of its resources on social protection but most&#13;
are absorbed by untargeted subsidies and pensions that benefit only a few. This assessment&#13;
suggests that it will be necessary to address three mutually complimentary issues: developing&#13;
effective mechanisms to maximize the impact of social protection on reducing poverty;&#13;
rationalizing public expenditures while filling existing program gaps; and strengthening&#13;
institutional arrangements. In order to address the multiple challenges Mozambique faces to&#13;
support particularly vulnerable groups and reduce extreme poverty and food insecurity, the&#13;
report proposes a gradual approach framed in the existing social protection strategy approved&#13;
by the Government in 2010.&#13;

            approved by the Government in 2010.
