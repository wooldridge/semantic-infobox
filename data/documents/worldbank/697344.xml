1. ABSOLUTE POVERTY IN CEINA&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1       China is widely recognized for its achievements in reducing absolute poverty&#13;
since the adoption of a broad program of rural economic reforms beginning in 1978. It&#13;
is estimated that, since that year, some 170 million Chinese escaped absolute poverty and&#13;
that the share of total population living in absolute poverty declined to less than 10 percent&#13;
by the middle of the 1980s. The form of poverty also changed over this period, from large&#13;
numbers of poor spread widely across the countryside to pockets of poverty in remote&#13;
resource-deficient areas. This change in the form of poverty required a change in the&#13;
govemment's approach to reducing poverty, and the Bank Group has been an active&#13;
participant in the design of the government's new national strategy for reducing absolute&#13;
poverty in the 1990s. As one of several means of operationalizing that new strategy, the&#13;
Government of China has requested Bank Group assistance in financing a poverty reduction&#13;
project in the poorest upland counties of the southwestern provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou&#13;
and Yunnan.&#13;
B. RURAL ABsoLuTE POVERTY&#13;
1.2       Background.  Rural economic reforms, including the adoption of the&#13;
production responsibility system, the dismantling of the commune system, agricultural&#13;
product price increases and market liberalization, were associated with dramatic rural&#13;
economic growth during 1978-85. The 1992 Bank Group study, China: Strategies for&#13;
Reducing Povery  in the 1990s (hereafter, Strategies),1/ concluded that broad&#13;
participation in that reform-driven rural economic growth brought about the tremendous&#13;
reduction in absolute poverty, from roughly 270 million poor in 1978 to about 100 million&#13;
in 1985, or from one third to about one tenth of the total rural population. Average rural&#13;
per capita income grew at an average annual rate of 13 percent in real terms during this&#13;
period, and increased a total of more than 140 percent. The gross value of agricultural&#13;
output increased by a total of 60 percent in real terms, at an average annual rate of&#13;
7 percent, or more than double the total growth and rate of the previous decade. Perhaps&#13;
most impressive was the increase in township and village enterprise (TVE) output and&#13;
employment levels. TVE output values appear to have increased fivefold in real terms&#13;
during 1978-85 (although part of this increase is explained by a broadening of the&#13;
definition of township and village enterprise beginning in 1984), and employment more&#13;

1.3       Correlates of Poverty. Absolute poverty in China is now concentrated in&#13;
resource-constrained remote upland areas. Since virtually all of China's rural population&#13;
received land use rights as part of the implementation of the production responsibility&#13;
system during the early 1980s, there are few if any landless laborers. Instead, the majority&#13;
of the rurl poor are now concentrated in resource-deficient areas, and comprise entire&#13;
communities located mostly in upland sections of the interior provinces of northern,&#13;
northwestern and southwestern China. Although these poor have land use rights, in most&#13;
cases the land itself is of such low quality that it is not possible to achieve subsistence&#13;
levels of crop production. Consequently, most poor consume grain and other subsistence&#13;
foods beyond their own production levels, and are negatively affected by price increases&#13;
for these products. The poorest households are typically those further disadvantaged by&#13;
high dependency ratios, ill health and other difficulties. Minority peoples are known to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
represent a highly disproportionate share of the rural poor. Available evidence does not&#13;
suggest that women are greatly overrepresented among the poor, although poverty certainly&#13;
does exacerbate society-wide problems of lower rates of female participation in education,&#13;
higher relative female infant mortality rates, and higher rates of maternal mortality.&#13;
1.4       The educational and health status of China's remaining absolute poor are&#13;
deplorable. At least 50 percent of the boys in many of China's poorest towns and villages&#13;
and, particularly in some minority areas, nearly 100 percent of the girls do not attend&#13;
school and will not achieve literacy. The infant mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio&#13;
in very poor counties-which exceed 10 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively-are at least&#13;
50 to 100 percent greater than the national average, and are much greater yet in the poorest&#13;
townships and villages. Incidence of several infectious and endemic diseases, including&#13;
tuberculosis and iodine deficiency disorders, is concentrated in poor and remote areas.&#13;
Roughly 50 percent of children in households at or below the absolute poverty line are at&#13;
least mildly malnourished (stunted), and iron, vitamin A, and other micronutrient&#13;
deficiencies remain a severe problem among the poor. As many as 90 percent of poor&#13;
children suffer chronic worm infections.&#13;
1.5       Recent Trends. The incidence of rural absolute poverty does not appear to&#13;
have significantly declined during the second half of the 1980s.  A number of&#13;
macroeconomic developments stymied concerted government efforts to reduce poverty&#13;
during 1985-90: (a) sharply increased prices for grain and other subsistence goods&#13;
adversely affected the real incomes of the majority of the rural poor; (b) rapid growth of&#13;
the working age population exceeded the expansion of employment opportunities,&#13;
contributing to a temporary worsening of rural underemployment (during 1989-90);&#13;
(c) economic growth was greater in the higher-income coastal provinces than in the lower-&#13;
income inland northwestern and southwestern provinces; and (d) rural income levels&#13;
stagnated during the second half of the 1980s (the average annual growth rate of real per&#13;
capita rural income declined to only 1 percent during 1985-90). In addition, fiscal&#13;
decentralization passed an increasing share of the costs of rural social and relief services&#13;
to local governments. While successful in better-off areas, this fiscal reform put pressure&#13;
on the limited revenues of poor area governments. In the absence of adequate levels of&#13;
appropriately earmarked funding from higher levels of government, poor-area local&#13;
governments have been unable to support either adequate social services or economic&#13;
growth.&#13;
1.6       The key obstacle to reducing poverty during 1985-90, however, was the&#13;
absence of meaningful levels of agricultural growth and rural enterprise development in the&#13;
upland areas. Many of the rural poor in 1978 resided in less remote and less hilly areas,&#13;
where increased application of fertilizer, irrigation, better seed and other modern inputs&#13;
could bring about rapid productivity gains, and so were able to participate in the rapid&#13;
agricultural growth of 1978-84. However, the quick reductions of poverty through&#13;
agricultural growth were largely exhausted by end-1984. Most of the residual poor have&#13;
remained trapped in more remote upland areas where agricultural productivity gains have&#13;
proven far more problematic. Measured on a per capita basis, output of grain and&#13;
subsistence foods in such areas failed to sustain any significant increase during the 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Although the agriculture sector did expand in real terms during 1985-89, increased output&#13;
of nongrain crops and animal and aquatic products, products that few of the poor either&#13;
produce or consume in significant quantities, accounted for virtually all of the modest&#13;
growth that did occur. By comparison, the very strong annual growth during 1978-84 of&#13;
per capita production of grain and oilseeds-which are the subsistence crops of most&#13;
immediate importance to the poor-turned negative during 1985-89.&#13;
1.7        TVEs, an important source of employment in the rural economy as a whole,&#13;
have developed very slowly in poor areas. In the early 1980s, TVE employment actually&#13;
decreased in poor areas as the commune system was dismantled and workers could no&#13;
longer be paid in work points instead of cash. Employment rose only after a 1984 policy&#13;
initiative supporting private rural enterprise opened opportunities for small, family firms&#13;
particularly suited to the small market niches available in poor areas. However, by 1990,&#13;
only 4 percent of the rural labor force in China's 120 poorest counties had found&#13;
employment in rural enterprises, in contrast to the 22 percent finding such employment in&#13;
the nation as a whole. Restraints on labor mobility were relaxed during the 1980s,&#13;
enabling an increasing number of the rural poor to share in national TVE growth by&#13;
migrating to employment opportunities where they occur. Unfortunately, after tremendous&#13;
growth during 1978-88, TVE employment declined in 1989 and 1990 in response to the&#13;
government's strong deflationary measures implemented in those two years. It is believed&#13;
that the absolute poor were among the first to lose their jobs during the temporary decline&#13;
in TVE employment.&#13;
1.8        Current Status. Official government estimates indicate that the number of&#13;
absolute poor has declined to about 80 million, or less than 7 percent of the total&#13;
population, during the early 1990s. Although an independent estimate of the current&#13;
number of absolute poor has not been undertaken, extraordinarily strong overall economic&#13;
growth, coupled with a resurgence of rural income growth and TVE employment during&#13;
1990-93, would certainly have been consistent with a substantial decline in absolute&#13;
poverty.l/ As shown in Table 1.2, the growth rate of real rural income recovered from&#13;
only 1 percent during 1985-90 to 4 percent during 1990-93. TVE employment, having&#13;
declined in 1989 and 1990, also increased sharply during 1991-93, expanding by 10 million&#13;
jobs each year. Grain production also increased strongly during 1990-93, leading to a&#13;
temporary decline in the market price of grain, with consequential benefits for the absolute&#13;
poor. However, while it appears that the incidence of absolute poverty did decline during&#13;

2/  Strategies estimated the incidence of absolute poverty for each year 1978 and 1980-90. Unfortunately,&#13;
changes in the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) calculation of mral income beginning in 1991 do not&#13;
allow for a simple extension of the methodologies employed in Strategies To estimate the incidence of&#13;
absolute poverty in 1991-93. Instead, the Bank Group's Policy Research Department (Poverty and&#13;
Human Resources Division; PRDPH) has initiated work with SSB to establish an updated methodology&#13;
for estimating poverty in the 1990s. Initial results of the PRDPH and SSB work suggests that the "head&#13;
count' incidence of absolute poverty may have declined slightly during 1990-92, but there was a&#13;
significant worsening of the severity of remaining poverty during those same years (i.e., the poverty&#13;
gap increased).&#13;

C. TE GOVEaNmErr'S POVERTY REDuCTION PROGRAM&#13;
1.9       Institutions. The Chinese government has a strong commitment to poverty&#13;
reduction, and most government ministries and agencies have special poverty reduction&#13;
responsibilities and projects. The Ministry of Civil Affairs provides disaster relief and&#13;
income maintenance support, and coordinates the distribution of relief grain through the&#13;
Ministry of Domestic Trade's Grain Bureau system. The State Education Commission and&#13;
the Ministry of Public Health administer some special programs to improve the education&#13;
and health status of the poor. The newly established Agricultural Development Bank of&#13;
China offers subsidized loans for poor-area development through a variety of funds&#13;
administered by provincial bank branches and their networks of county and lower-level&#13;
banks (until mid-1994, these funds were administered by the Agricultural Bank of China&#13;
and several other banks). The State Planning Commission administers a Food-for-Work&#13;
Program, which assists with the building of roads and riverine transport, drinldng water&#13;
systems, irrigation works and other capital construction in poor areas. In addition, each&#13;
of 27 central ministries and agencies has its own special poor-area project and every&#13;
province has its own specially-funded programs.&#13;
1.10      The State Council's Leading Group for Poverty Reduction (LGPR) was&#13;
established in 1986, in part to provide greater coherence to these many poverty reduction&#13;
initiatives and, in particular, to expedite economic development in the poor areas. Since&#13;
its establishment, LGPR and its executive agency, the Poor Area Development Office&#13;
(PADO), have emerged as the principal advocates of China's rural poor and are now the&#13;
I/  Official SSB data show that the proportion of nul households with avego nominal per capita inomes&#13;
of lows than 150 yuan (which is le thn half the government's official absolute poverty line) increasd&#13;
from 0.73 percent in 1990 to 0.83 pewcent in 1992.&#13;

- 6 -&#13;
key agencies responsible for coordinating the nation's $1 billion in annual funding for&#13;
poverty reduction programs. The State Council funds another three poverty reduction units&#13;
that operate within the LGPR orbit: the China Development Foundation for Poor Areas,&#13;
the Cadre Training Center, and the Economic Development Service Center. Provinces,&#13;
prefectures, and counties have all established Leading Groups and PADOs after the central&#13;
model, and many townships have a "designated person" to handle poverty reduction work.&#13;
1.11      Strategy. While continuing preexisting rural social and relief services, the&#13;
poverty reduction strategy adopted during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) introduced&#13;
a new emphasis on economic development programs in the poor areas. The Government's&#13;
commitment to sustained efforts to eradicate poverty also figured prominently in the Eighth&#13;
Five-Year Plan (1991-95). During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the Government&#13;
reconfirmed and extended LGPR's central role as the coordinating body responsible for&#13;
poverty measurement and research, project planning and monitoring, and management not&#13;
only of domestic funding but also of bilateral and multilateral assistance for poverty&#13;
reduction. The poverty reduction strategy announced in the Eighth Five-Year Plan&#13;
highlighted (a) a continued emphasis on developing the productive capacity of poor-area&#13;
agriculture and rural enterprise through subsidized loans, (b) better targeting of assistance&#13;
to reach the poorest of the poor, and (c) improved management and coordination of&#13;
poverty reduction activities.&#13;
1.12      The government's poverty reduction strategy has been further defined and&#13;
substantially updated through the newly issued National Seven-Year (1994-2000) Plan for&#13;
Poverty Reduction (8-7 Plan). The 8-7 Plan recognizes that the significant reduction and&#13;
change in nature of absolute poverty (para. 1.1) makes it more practical and fiscally less&#13;
burdensome to target increased development and social services assistance to China's&#13;
remaining absolute poor. In near complete agreement with Strategies' recommendations&#13;
for reducing poverty in the 1990s, the 8-7 Plan calls for:&#13;
(a)  institution building and policy reform, including a strengthening of the&#13;
institutions responsible for implementing explicit poverty reduction projects&#13;
and programs, the establishment of an independent and objective poverty&#13;
monitoring system, the concentration of available funding in the poorest&#13;
counties (a number of relatively well-off counties and provinces will be&#13;
"graduated" from the new poverty reduction program), and improved access&#13;
of the poor to employment opportunities outside the poor areas;&#13;
(b)  greater investment in the development of human capital, including more&#13;
central government funding for health, nutrition, education, and relief services&#13;
in the poorest areas; and&#13;
(c)  continued investment in poor-area agricultural, rural enterprise, road and other&#13;
rural infrastructure development projects.&#13;
1.13      Ofricially Designated Poor Counties. In 1986, using Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(MOA) county-level rural income data, LGPR developed a national roster of 331 poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
counties eligible for development assistance. A county was identified as poor if its 1985&#13;
average rural per capita income fell below poverty lines of Y 300, Y 200, or Y 150,&#13;
depending on other locational or political factors. Average per capita grain production of&#13;
less than 200 kg was also adopted as a second key indicator of poverty. In addition to the&#13;
national roster, 368 provincially designated poor counties, eligible for provincial funding,&#13;
were selected on the basis of poverty lines determined by the provinces. Province-specific&#13;
poverty lines used during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period ranged from Y 150 in Yunnan&#13;
to Y 400 in Jiangsu. In addition to drawing up a roster of poor counties, most provinces&#13;
have identified townships in otherwise well-off counties as eligible for special assistance.&#13;
As evidenced by the wide difference in qualifying income levels (Y 150 to Y 400), the&#13;
provincial rosters include a number of counties that are relatively poor by provincial&#13;
standards but that would not qualify as absolutely poor by the national minimum standard.&#13;
That provinces created their own special programs testifies to a concern with relative&#13;
poverty and, in many instances, to provincial budgetary strength. On the other hand, the&#13;
provincial roster does, in some cases, compensate for the incorrect exclusion of counties&#13;
with average per capita income levels below the national minimum standard. The Yunnan&#13;
provincial roster, for example, includes all the counties that should have received central&#13;
government support for absolute poverty reduction (that is, 15 counties with average per&#13;
capita income of between Y 120 to Y 150 in 1985).&#13;
1.14       While a very large proportion of the rural population within the officially&#13;
designated poor counties must have been poor, this definition of poverty failed to capture&#13;
the poor in otherwise well-off counties.A/  Based solely on 1985 income data,&#13;
furthermore, the method did not adequately correct for single-year aberrations in county&#13;
rural income levels. Strategies has also observed that the regionalization of poverty&#13;
evidenced by the MOA county-level rural income data is significantly different from that&#13;
indicated by the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) provincial rural income distribution data.&#13;
Notwithstanding these important issues, it is certain that the combined list of officially&#13;
designated poor counties captures the core of remaining absolute poverty in China.&#13;
Furthermore, under the new 8-7 Plan, the list of officially designated poor counties has&#13;
been reduced from 699 to 592, and a number of relatively well-off counties and provinces&#13;
will be 'graduated" from the new poverty reduction program (para. 1.12).&#13;
D. ORIGIN OF TE PROJEcr&#13;
1.15       Through the preparation  of Strategies and its public release at the&#13;
"International Conference on Poverty Issues in China" (held in Beijing in October 1992),&#13;
close collaboration with the Chinese government has been established and the Bank Group&#13;
has played an active role in the development of the new national strategy for reducing&#13;
absolute poverty in the 1990s (para. 1.12). At the conclusion of the conference, State&#13;
4/  Based on three-year (1981-83) average township-level runl per capita income data, the Research Center&#13;
for Rural Development (RCRD) had earlier identified 50 million absolute poor residing in about 7,000&#13;
townships, situated in 225 counties in 11 mountainous regions. While a preferred means of monitoring&#13;
poverty, the RCRD township-level mothodology was not an operationally viable mechanism for&#13;
targeting China's poverty reduction progrm. In 1986 LGPR switched to the county level for the&#13;
purposes of poverty reduction programs and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Councilor Chen Junsheng (the Govemment of China's senior policymaker for agriculture,&#13;
rural development, and poverty reduction) and senior Bank Group staff announced the&#13;
proposal to operationalize Strategies' recommendations for reducing poverty in the 1990s&#13;
through a Bank Group-assisted project to reduce poverty in southwestern China. It was&#13;
decided at that time that the project would take a multisectoral approach to reducing&#13;
absolute poverty in the worst-affected upland areas of Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.&#13;
Consistent with one of the principal themes of the conference, it was also agreed that the&#13;
project would encourage community participation during preparation and implementation&#13;
and that all interested international agencies, both official and nongovemmental, would be&#13;
invited to participate in project preparation, funding and implementation. Supported by&#13;
a generous Japan: Policy and Human Resources Development Fund grant, project&#13;
preparation included local and international consultants and five missions to China during&#13;
July 1993 to December 1994.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLvENMWr&#13;
1.16      The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy in that it directly&#13;
addresses two of the Bank Group's top operational priorities in China, namely poverty&#13;
reduction and environmental protection. Bank Group participation in the project will&#13;
greatly assist the realization of the government's 8-7 Plan and it is expected that, if&#13;
successful, the project will become a prototype for extension to the remainder of China's&#13;
poor areas and the overall poverty reduction program. Bank Group involvement in the&#13;
project will also play a catalytic function in the establishment of an independent national-&#13;
level poverty monitoring system. In addition, Bank Group participation is helping to focus&#13;
the project's rural development component toward the development and provision of an&#13;
integrated package of environmentally sound andfarmer-determined technologies for more&#13;
productive upland agriculture.&#13;
F. BANK GROUP SECrOR WORK AND LENDING OPERAnoNS&#13;
1.17      During the early and mid-1980s, the first Country Economic Report and the&#13;
Gansu Provincial Study devoted much analysis to China's income distribution and the&#13;
physical well-being of the Chinese population and the poor.5/ A number of Bank Group-&#13;
supported projects during these years, including the Gansu Provincial Development Project&#13;
(Loan 2812-CHA and Credit 1793-CHA) and the Northern Irrigation Project (Credit 1885-&#13;
CHA), directly helped reduce poverty by providing opportunities for voluntary resettlement&#13;
to newly irrigated areas for hundreds of thousands of absolute poor residing in rainfed&#13;
upland areas of the Loess Plateau. The Gansu Provincial Development Project also&#13;
included a very effective rural education subproject that targeted the absolute poor. More&#13;
generally, the Bank Group's program of agricultural investments (about 40 projects in all),&#13;
buttressed by projects supporting agricultural education, rural health care and rural water&#13;
supply, played a significant role in raising rural incomes and living standards during the&#13;
1980s.&#13;

1.18      Completion of Strategies contributed to making poverty reduction a more&#13;
explicit focus of Bank Group lending in China in the early 1990s. Bank Group-supported&#13;
poverty reduction activities, channeled to areas of concentrated poverty in central and&#13;
western China, now include poor-area health, education, rural water supply and hygiene,&#13;
and numerous agricultural projects and agricultural project subcomponents. The Rural&#13;
Health Workers Development Project (Credit 2539-CHA) aims at better-quality health&#13;
services, improved health status, and the development of new financing models for health&#13;
services in the poorest areas. The Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Project&#13;
(Credit 2655-CHA) addresses the malnutrition, epidemic disease and high maternal and&#13;
infant mortality rates that remain widespread among China's absolute poor. The Infectious&#13;
Diseases Project (Credit 2317-CHA) seeks to reduce the incidence and risk of infection of&#13;
two severe diseases that are most prevalent in poor areas. The Education Development in&#13;
Poor Provinces (Credit 2339-CHA) and Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas&#13;
(Credit 2651 -CHA) projects are helping to improve primary and lower-secondary education&#13;
and schools in poor counties and villages. By increasing coverage of safe water supply and&#13;
sanitation, health and hygiene services, the Rural Water and Sanitation Project (Credit&#13;
2336-CHA) improves health and productivity of some of the poorest and most needy&#13;
inhabitants of rural China. The Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project (Credit&#13;
2616-CHA) seeks to double real income levels for the 1.2 million rural poor in the targeted&#13;
watersheds by increasing agricultural productivity. The Shaanxi Agricultural Development&#13;
(Credit 1997-CHA), Henan Agricultural Development (Credit 2242-CHA), Tarim Basin&#13;
(Credit 2294), Guangdong Agricultural Development (Credit 2307-CHA) and Sichuan&#13;
Agricultural Development (Credit 2411-CHA) projects include poverty reduction&#13;
subprojects in several extremely poor counties. Attacking poverty through single-sector&#13;
programs, these projects and project components have made a real and sustainable&#13;
contribution to poverty reduction. However, no Bank Group-supported project in China&#13;
has as yet used a focused, multisectoral rural development approach to attack absolute&#13;
poverty in a severely resource-deficient area where single-sector programs cannot achieve&#13;
sustained poverty reduction.&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PiEVIOuS BANK GROUP OPERAToNS&#13;
1.19      The Bank Group's experience with a large number of multisectoral rural-&#13;
development-cum-poverty-reduction projects has not been entirely successful in terms of&#13;
impact or sustainability. An extensive OED review of two decades of Bank Group&#13;
experience with rural development projects documents that the complexity of project design&#13;
and implementation and problems with institutional coordination have been the principal&#13;
causes of mixed results.&amp;/ This confirms the warning of the Bank Group's 1975 Rural&#13;
Development Sector Policy Paper that such projects tend to suffer from a program design&#13;
that is too ambitious and complex, calling for exceptional leadership that cannot always be&#13;
made available on a sustained basis. Recognizing that these institutional difficulties are&#13;
inherent to multisectoral projects, the OED analysis favors the approach of 'implementing&#13;
separate project components in different ministries as though they were separate projects,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
but with a coordinating unit located in a nonsector ministry such as Planning or the&#13;
President's Office' and emphasizes the importance of long-term institution building. The&#13;
OED report also highlights the importance of (a) strong government commitment to the&#13;
project and a favorable macroeconomic cnvironment, (b) relying primarily on locally&#13;
proven technical innovations (the results of research and trials were often not available in&#13;
time to have an impact on concurrent projects), (c) retaining flexibility in program design&#13;
during implementation (i.e., after the time of appraisal), and (d) supplementing the Bank&#13;
Group's own inputs, during design and supervision, to cover the full range of skills&#13;
required by a multisectoral project. A more recent OED review of the Aga Khan Rural&#13;
Support Program (AKRSP), on the other hand, concludes that 'rural development can be&#13;
made to work' with proper project design and implementation.2/ Additional key lessons&#13;
from the successful AKRSP experience are the importance of (e) a comprehensive&#13;
monitoring and evaluation process and (f) full community participation.&#13;
1.20      Project design and plans for organization and management have carefully taken&#13;
these lessons into consideration. Most importantly, LGPR, which is an interministerial&#13;
office of the State Council, will be responsible for coordinating project design and, through&#13;
the provincial and county Project Management Offices (PMOs) and Leading Groups (LGs),&#13;
monitoring implementation. During the course of project preparation, LGPR's World&#13;
Bank Project Office (WBPO) was established with Bureau-level status and approved for&#13;
30 professional-level staff positions. The county PMOs, in close collaboration with the&#13;
sectoral bureaus and agencies, would be responsible for the actual implementation of the&#13;
project. This approach, in a somewhat simpler form, has been validated in previous Bank&#13;
Group projects in China.S/ In addition, the project enjoys strong government support&#13;
and a favorable macroeconomic environment, relies primarily on an integrated package of&#13;
proven technologies, and would establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation&#13;
process. It is believed that current Bank Group procedures provide adequate allowance for&#13;
changes to project design during the course of implementation. Lastly, the project&#13;
encourages community participation by enabling households to make key decisions during&#13;
project design and implementation.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. NATuRAL REsouRcEs, LAND USE AND POVERTY&#13;
2.1       Location. The project would take place in 35 mountainous and remote poor&#13;
counties of Yunnan (10 counties), Guizhou (13) and Guangxi (12). These counties, which&#13;
are all nationally designated poor counties under the 8-7 Plan (para. 1.14), stretch over&#13;
700 kilometers (km) from northeast Yunnan on the southern bank of the Yangtze River to&#13;
the northwest corner of Guangxi bordering Viet Nam. The project counties in Guangxi&#13;
and Guizhou are located along the axis of the new Nanning-to-Kunming rail line (now&#13;
scheduled for completion in 1996), and should benefit from this major improvement to&#13;
transport capacity. In contrast, there is no rail link passing through northeast Yunnan, and&#13;
transport to and from the project counties in the Zhaotong Prefecture region is expected&#13;
to remain constrained. The project villages have a farm population of 635,000 households&#13;
and cover an area of some 22,000 km2. The project area is shown in the map Project&#13;
Counties (IBRD No. 26524) and summary project area statistics are given in Annex 1.&#13;
2.2       Poverty and Environmental Destruction. Livelihood systems in the project&#13;
area are based on subsistence farming, with only intermittent access to very small amounts&#13;
of cash from both agricultural and off-farm origin. The project villages form pockets of&#13;
rural poverty subject to an unfavorable natural resource base and long distances to markets&#13;
and services. It is not coincidental that the project-area poor reside in a region of&#13;
mounting environmental degradation-these poor have little alternative but to extract their&#13;
meager livelihood on some of the nation's least productive but most ecologicaUy fragile&#13;
lands. The poor are both the perpetrators of upland environmental destruction, abetted by&#13;
sometimes adverse government policy, and the victims of that destruction in that it further&#13;
diminishes agricultural potential.&#13;
Land Use and Poverty&#13;
2.3       The low-elevation karst ranges of southwest Guizhou and northwest Guangxi&#13;
make up the southern half of the project area. The Yunnan-Guizhou karst plateau, actuaUy&#13;
a rugged mountainous region with elevations from 1,500 meters (m) in Guizhou to&#13;
2,300 m in Yunnan, comprises the northern half of the project area. Both regions face&#13;
similar severe environmental constraints: (a) only a small portion of the total land area is&#13;
suitable for crop production; (b) the hydrological regime, together with elevation, restricts&#13;
paddy and double-cropping and has hampered previous attempts to intensify corn&#13;
production; and (c) the large remaining land area is ineffectively utilized and heavily&#13;
degraded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.4       Flat Land. In the karst ranges, the cultivated flat land is typically restricted&#13;
to 1 to 5 hectare (ha) patches located in "sink holes" between karst peaks, and accounts&#13;
for only 5 percent of the total land area. The available flat land in the project area&#13;
amounts to only 0.06 ha per capita, or about half the national average of 0.1 ha per capita.&#13;
The highly uneven hydrological regime of these sink holes precludes paddy cultivation, and&#13;
often restricts cropping patterns to one crop of corn, followed by a marginal crop that is&#13;
exposed to flooding hazards. A much greater proportion, about 20 percent, of the total&#13;
land area of the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau is cultivated. Although one tenth of a hectare&#13;
is available per capita on the plateau, the distinctly cold climate, in combination with a&#13;
prolonged dry season (extending late into spring), allows only one crop of corn in most&#13;
upland poor villages. Fields located above 2,100 m of elevation are planted to potatoes&#13;
and buckwheat. Some paddy is grown in valleys below 1,500 m of elevation, but it is&#13;
often at least partly rainfed. (Detailed data on climate, soils and agricultural land use are&#13;
presented in Annex ).&#13;
2.5       Sloped Land. Steep rocky slopes with a degraded vegetative cover comprise&#13;
at least three quarters of the project total land area. These sloped lands are officially&#13;
considered to be forest land (about 50 percent), pasture (about 30 percent) and "wasteland"&#13;
(the remaining 20 percent of sloped land). However, actual forest cover is found mostly&#13;
in a limited number of government-backed reforestation areas that comprise less than&#13;
20 percent of the area considered to be forest land. Half of the pasture land, located on&#13;
open karst, has very low potential. Unused or unallocated land is officially classified as&#13;
"wasteland," and is severely affected by unsustainable land use practices.&#13;
2.6       Environmental Destruction. The absence of secure land tenure rights has&#13;
been identified as a major cause of environmental degradation of the sloped lands in the&#13;
project area. Marked environmental degradation is ongoing in better-off villages, where&#13;
farmers are extending cash crops on erodible slopes, and uncontrolled animal numbers&#13;
result in extensive and highly visible overgrazing. Poorer villages have seen a clear&#13;
decline in their agricultural resource base during the last several decades. Unbalanced&#13;
farming practices have depleted karst soils from their originally fairly high ferility levels,&#13;
and recovery from the heavy deforestation of the Great Leap Forward period (1958-59)&#13;
will be a lengthy process that has only recently begun. Large tracts of terraces built on&#13;
erodible soils are now in disrepair and, following decollectivization in the early 1980s,&#13;
water conservancy facilities in the project area have not always been adequately&#13;
maintained.&#13;
2.7       Previous policies of restricted out-migration, in combination with an increasing&#13;
population, have resulted in locally heavy population pressure, particularly on the Yunnan-&#13;
Guizhou plateau. The population density reaches a maximum of 270 people per km2 at the&#13;
meeting point between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. Most of the fragile wasteland in&#13;
this region is in fact already planted to food crops, contributing to extensive soil erosion&#13;
and frequent landslides.&#13;
2.8       Agricultural Support Services.  Chemical fertilizers, including urea and&#13;
phosphate, are widely available in project townships. However, availability of seeds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
seedlings and animal production services is still limited. There are supply problems for&#13;
seed for the principal crop, corn, and marketing channels for seeds of secondary food&#13;
crops, including potato, have only recently been set up. Most tree crop nurseries only&#13;
support government-backed planting programs, and acceptable-quality livestock breeds and&#13;
reliable veterinary services are not usually available outside of county seats and better-off&#13;
townships.&#13;
2.9       The agricultural extension service does not have the financial resources and&#13;
qualified staff that would be needed to address the diverse physical and human environment&#13;
in mountain areas. Programs typically take the form of campaigns to promote the use of&#13;
subsidized agricultural inputs, and no formal credit is available to many households for&#13;
farming activities. In the absence of a national research program on karst and mountain&#13;
environments in southwest China, the only technology package available for extension is&#13;
plastic sheeting for hybrid corn.&#13;
2.10      Grain Availability and Cash Income.  Nonhybrid varieties, with yields&#13;
averaging only about 2 tons per ha, occupy 60 to 95 percent of project counties' corn area.&#13;
Consistent with these low yields and the limited cultivated area per capita, more than half&#13;
the population in the project villages produced less than 150 kg of grain per capita during&#13;
1991-93. Between 10 to 50 kg per capita of relief grain are brought into the project&#13;
counties annually, but these quantities are not sufficient to raise per capita grain availability&#13;
to the 200 kg per capita minimum necessary for basic subsistence. The consequential&#13;
widespread moderate to severe malnutrition has been a chronic problem in the project areas&#13;
since population growth rates, although steadily decreasing, have more than offset the&#13;
modest increases in grain production over the last decade.&#13;
2.11      More than 80 percent of project households live below the poverty line of&#13;
Y 320. In five of the eight project counties in northeast Yunnan, average rural per capita&#13;
net income is less than Y 160. Since most income is in kind and consumed on-farm, entire&#13;
households typically have cash incomes of only Y 150 to Y 300 ($15 to $35) per year.&#13;
Sources of cash income, apart from irregular off-farm activities such as local coal mining&#13;
and labor mobility to urban areas, mainly consist of occasional animal sales and collection&#13;
of forest products. Households with very limited land area, with high dependency ratios&#13;
or impoverished by medical fees for family illness, or with no farm animals left, have&#13;
incomes far less than these average figures.&#13;
Upland Agricultural Development Potential&#13;
2.12      Despite their unfavorable natural resource base, there is promise for increasing&#13;
the agricultural productivity of the project upland poor. There is some potential for the&#13;
rehabilitation of natural resources and the prevention of their further degradation. The&#13;
national strategy for rural poverty reduction has recently shifted from the singular objective&#13;
of reaching grain self-sufficiency in favor of increasing income-earning capacity through&#13;
improved, diversified farming systems with animal husbandry, cash crops, particularly tree&#13;
crops, and off-farm income. Market opportunities for these various alternative activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
are now reaching the project area. Perhaps most importantly, it should now be possible&#13;
to improve farmers' land use rights for sloped land and particularly wastelands (para. 2.5).&#13;
2.13      Corn-based farming systems can, to some degree, be intensified.  With&#13;
carefully applied research, it should be possible to develop hybrid corn varieties that better&#13;
suit upland farmers' consumption tastes. Where coal on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and&#13;
fuelwood in the karst ranges are available to be used as fuel, corn stalks can be processed&#13;
for use as animal feed. At the same time, low-cost improved technologies should be&#13;
developed for a varied range of other food crops. Integrated with increased animal and&#13;
tree crop production, these several technologies would markedly improve income levels&#13;
and nutritional status.&#13;
2.14      In addition, throughout the project area, there are numerous localized&#13;
opportunities with considerable agricultural development potential. In the karst ranges, for&#13;
example, 25 percent of the area is made up of gently sloped limestone hills bearing red&#13;
earths, which are suitable to paddy terraces and to orchard and tea development. In&#13;
northeast Yunnan, the deep valleys of the Yangtze River system face an arid climate, but&#13;
the less remote valleys have potential for developing tropical products once drinking water&#13;
and irrigation facilities have been rehabilitated or expanded. Appropriate investment in&#13;
these opportunities should be balanced with support for improved and diversified poor-&#13;
household farming systems.&#13;
B. SociAL SERVICEs&#13;
2.15      Education. Despite impressive gains in educational attainment on a national&#13;
level, the educational status in the project areas is abysmally low. Official figures indicate&#13;
that while in China primary school enrollment is on average 98 percent, in project areas&#13;
only 60 percent of the 7-15 age cohort have ever enrolled in primary school. Of these&#13;
children, about 65 percent are boys. As with enrollment rates, completion rates vary&#13;
considerably. While the national average for primary school completion is about&#13;
82 percent, completion in project townships (which include project areas and better-off&#13;
nonproject administrative villages) can be as low as 45 percent. Furthermore, SSB survey&#13;
data covering the poorest households in the project areas (para. 3.39) suggest that among&#13;
the 13-15 age cohort, only 20 percent of the boys and 5 percent of the girls graduated from&#13;
primary school. In addition, minorities, more so than nonminorities, experience lower&#13;
educational attainment. Given the above, it is no surprise that many do not achieve&#13;
literacy (para. 1.4).&#13;
2.16      Low educational status among those in the project areas reflects the reality that&#13;
access to primary education for the poor is quite limited and those services that exist suffer&#13;
in terms of quality. While the central government provides financial transfers to the poor&#13;
areas of China, these resources are not adequate to meet all primary education needs, and&#13;
financing of education is mainly the responsibility of local governments and communities.&#13;
As part of their cost-recovery process, these local entities have required that families pay&#13;
for children to attend school. Although this fee is modest (about $5 per school year), it&#13;
represents nearly 25 percent of average rural per capita income in the poorest areas,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
thereby hindering access of many children to school. In addition, parents often have to&#13;
pay boarding and transportation for children in grades six and above. This, combined with&#13;
the perceived opportunity cost of forgone household labor, greatly decreases access to&#13;
primary education, especially for females. Limited funds have also resulted in a lack of&#13;
primary school places and dilapidated school buildings.&#13;
2.17       Along with insufficient access, the delivery of primary education suffers from&#13;
inadequate teacher training, insufficient books and instructional equipment, and poor&#13;
management. Preservice and inservice training courses in China focus on teaching subject&#13;
matter and methods appropriate for large urban schools, but few courses are offered for&#13;
teachers on the methods and techniques required for small and ethnically mixed rural&#13;
schools. There is little practice in multigrade or multisubject teaching techniques, or in&#13;
bilingual education. In addition, on average, most of these teachers are lower-secondary&#13;
school graduates and some did not even graduate from primary school. Thus, a portion&#13;
of the teachers in poor rural areas do not have the basic academic background to acquire&#13;
adequate teaching skills.&#13;
2.18      Health. As with education, while China has made tremendous progress in&#13;
enhancing the health of its population, improvements have been uneven and have occurred&#13;
primarily in urban areas. Infant mortality, maternal mortality, and nutritional status are&#13;
far worse in project areas compared to the national average and better-off areas (para. 1.4).&#13;
The poor health status of those in the project areas stems from a combination of limited&#13;
access to health services and the low quality of services provided.&#13;
2.19       In the context of insufficient levels of govemment support combined with&#13;
severe poverty, access to health care in the project areas is hindered by the fee-for-service&#13;
provision of most health services, the dilapidated and insufficient number of health clinics,&#13;
an inadequate quantity and flow of pharmaceuticals and supplies. SSB survey data indicate&#13;
that approximately 90 percent of the poorest in project areas cannot afford to pay for&#13;
medical services. Almost half of the project villages do not have a health post, so villagers&#13;
must travel on average at least 4 km to reach a health facility. The village health clinics&#13;
and township hospitals that exist are invariably dilapidated. Furthermore, often health&#13;
facilities do not have an adequate stock of pharmaceuticals and lack essential equipment&#13;
to provide even the basics of health care.&#13;
2.20      The quality of the health services that reach the poor population greatly suffers&#13;
because of inadequate training on the part of providers, insufficient monetary incentives&#13;
to provide quality care, and poor planning and management. The care practices and skills&#13;
of health staff at all, but particularly at lower levels, is problematic. Salaries for health&#13;
workers are insufficient, resulting in low retention rates and workers splitting their time&#13;
between health tasks and other income-earning activities. Furthermore, reliable data on&#13;
mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status that are important in designing and evaluating&#13;
health and nutrition interventions are lacking.&#13;
2.21       The Benefits of Targeting Social Services to the Poor. The benefits of&#13;
targeting education and health interventions to the poor are well known. Basic investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
in human resources are key ingredients for effective poverty reduction. Thes investments&#13;
complement one another-a healthy and well-fed child learns more in school. They also&#13;
enhance a person's ability to be productive and to earn income. Fortunately, relatively&#13;
modest and well-targeted investments in human resources have proven to be very effective&#13;
in increasing literacy and wages in the case of education and in decreasing health outcomes&#13;
such as morbidity and mortality.&#13;
C. RURAL INDFRASUC1URE&#13;
2.22      The government's Food-for-Work Program (para. 1.9) has provided a total of&#13;
Y 10 billion during 1984-93 for the construction of roads, water supply facilities, and other&#13;
infrastructure in China's poor areas. Achievements have been significant: since the late&#13;
1980s, 1,500 townships have been linked to the network of rural roads; about 56 million&#13;
of the rural poor have been served with basic water supply systems; and over 1 million ha&#13;
of land have been rehabilitated through soil and water conservation works and served with&#13;
irrigation facilities. However, some 1,700 townships and 17,000 administrative villages&#13;
have yet to be served with rural roads, and there remain some 50 million inhabitants in the&#13;
poor regions without access to potable water. About 13 percent of rural households have&#13;
yet to be served with even some rudimentary form of electricity supply. The remaining&#13;
unserviced areas include the very poorest regions. Extending infrastructure coverage to&#13;
these areas will be more challenging, both technically and financially, because of the&#13;
remoteness of these thinly populated villages located in difficult, mountainous terrain.&#13;
2.23      Despite the success of the Food-for-Work Program, the environmental&#13;
degradation and lack of rural infrastructure in the poorest villages of southwest China make&#13;
living conditions harsh and arduous. Inhabitants in these regions often have to cover long&#13;
distances by foot and labor through steep terrain to reach the nearest source of drinking&#13;
water, and even there the water source may be contaminated or contain high levels of&#13;
fluoride. The nearest dirt roads are reached only after some kilometers of steep climb and&#13;
descent by jungle tracks, and considerable labor is expended by villagers in bringing their&#13;
small amounts of agricultural and forest products to the nearest farmers' market. Lack of&#13;
access to basic facilities such as water supply, roads, electricity and telecommunications&#13;
constitutes a severe constraint to the increased productivity and improved well-being of the&#13;
poorest communities in these remote villages.&#13;
2.24      Paved roads reach all project county towns and dirt roads reach almost all&#13;
project townships, but only 60 percent of all administrative villages in project townships&#13;
(and a much smaller percentage of project villages themselves) have any road access. The&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of water systems is particularly urgent in the Guangxi and&#13;
Guizhou project counties where more than half of project villages face seasonal drinking&#13;
water shortages and a very small proportion of cultivated land is irrigated. Roughly half&#13;
the project administrative villages have access to electricity, and about one quarter to&#13;
telephone networks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
D. LABOR MARKS, EMLoYMENT AND TVE DEvELoPMENT&#13;
2.25      Labor Markets. Rural underemployment is a major challenge for the Chinese&#13;
government, and agricultural job creation, which is expected to increase only marginally&#13;
in the 1990s (less than 1 percent per year at best), cannot solve the problem. The&#13;
difficulty is worst in the upland counties of Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and other western&#13;
provinces, where there are large pools of surplus laborers. Project data indicate that more&#13;
than one third of the rural population in the project areas are chronically underemployed&#13;
(i.e., classified as "surplus workers").&#13;
2.26      A profile of the underemployed in project areas has identified a large pool of&#13;
potentially productive workers, provided they are offered rudimentary training. At least&#13;
half of these underemployed are illiterate or have only completed primary school&#13;
education. Three quarters of the underemployed in the project area are between the ages&#13;
of 16 to 35, and nearly half are ethnic minority people who speak local dialects.&#13;
2.27      TVE Development. The TVE sector has been one of the most dynamic&#13;
elements of the economic boom in China over the past 15 years. TVEs are a promising&#13;
source of employment for the rural underemployed (paras. 1.7 and 1.8). Nationally, TVE&#13;
sales revenues amounted to Y 474 billion in the first quarter of 1994, a real increase of&#13;
more than 50 percent over the comparable period in 1993. TVE employment has&#13;
continued to expand, providing jobs to more than 123 million workers, or some 28 percent&#13;
of the national rural labor force, in 1993.&#13;
2.28      Although TVE development in China's central and western regions was weak&#13;
during the early 1980s, there has been surprisingly strong TVE growth in these regions in&#13;
the more recent past, with increases in output value of 50 and 70 percent, respectively.&#13;
Buoyed by rapid TVE growth in Guangxi's coastal, municipal and eastern areas, TVE&#13;
employment increased sharply from 11 percent of Guangxi's rural labor force to more than&#13;
19 percent in 1993. Although TVE employment continues to represent a relatively low&#13;
share of the total rural labor force in Guizhou and Yunnan, viz., about 9 percent, or just&#13;
one third of the 1993 national average, such employment has grown rapidly in recent&#13;
years.&#13;
2.29      Despite very rapid growth at the provincial level, significant barriers remain&#13;
that block the development of agroprocessing, mineral processing, handicraft and other&#13;
industries in the poor upland project areas. Project county TVE and Labor Bureau staff&#13;
attribute the lack of TVE development to the lack of investment credit and working capital&#13;
and poorly developed infrastructure. While TVE managers may be attracted by relatively&#13;
low wage costs and the availability of agricultural and mineral raw materials, these&#13;
advantages are often not sufficient to overcome the lack of financing, roads, reliable&#13;
electricity supply and other basic requirements.&#13;
2.30      While the development of new railroad links and improved rural roads are&#13;
promising developments for future TVE investment, upland counties with high&#13;
concentrations of absolute poor could continue to be overlooked. The production and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
employment potential of these counties is illustrated by TVE development in Puding&#13;
County (Guizhou). Recently established labor-intensive TVEs include carpet weaving and&#13;
embroidery, and together these types of TVEs should be able to create a substantial&#13;
number of jobs over the next three years. These TVEs have begun to experiment with&#13;
innovative business practices such as "satellite factories," which would create home-based&#13;
jobs in project areas. Despite large numbers of orders for their products, these ventures&#13;
have been unable to attract sufficient investment credit or working capital. Other TVEs&#13;
throughout the project area, such as marble factories and fruit processing plants, have&#13;
significant job creation potential but remain underfunded.&#13;
2.31      Labor Mobility. Local TVEs cannot create sufficient numbers of jobs for the&#13;
large number of rural surplus laborers in upland counties, and many unemployed people&#13;
turn to labor mobility as an alternative. However, poor households in upland counties&#13;
suffer from serious labor-market barriers that raise the risks of labor mobility and lower&#13;
the returns. Faced with limited local employment opportunities and little information about&#13;
jobs in distant markets, tens of thousands of surplus laborers from upland households use&#13;
informal labor mobility channels to find work. Households report having to liquidate&#13;
assets or take on additional debt from local sources to finance frequently unsuccessful job&#13;
searches. There are a few traditional village networks with urban connections to provide&#13;
support to migrants, such as those available to surplus laborers from Sichuan and Zhejiang&#13;
provinces, but these are not yet well developed in most of the project counties.&#13;
2.32      Existing government-organized channels have not been focused on helping the&#13;
millions of underemployed upland migrants eager to find jobs in urban markets. Until&#13;
recently, the priority of provincial labor bureaus has instead been the redeployment of&#13;
unemployed workers from state-owned enterprises in urban areas. Both spontaneous and&#13;
government-organized channels now exist, but Ministry of Labor officials believe that the&#13;
largest share of migrants from poor upland households use the riskier spontaneous&#13;
channels. The Yunnan Provincial Labor Bureau, for example, organized the migration of&#13;
48,000 rural workers in 1993, but estimates that an additional 300,000 people left their&#13;
place of origin without assistance. The Guizhou Provincial Labor Bureau found jobs for&#13;
60,000 people in 1992, mostly in the toy, fireworks and electronics factories and service&#13;
industries of Guangdong. An additional 220,000 reportedly used spontaneous channels,&#13;
with many heading for the highly competitive and rapidly growing urban labor markets in&#13;
Shanghai and Guangzhou.&#13;
2.33      One reason for large-scale spontaneous labor mobility is that wage rate&#13;
differences between poor rural areas and prosperous urban and rural areas have grown,&#13;
from a 300 percent difference in 1982 to about 600 percent at present. The large wage&#13;
rate gap holds the promise of large remittances as a source of cash income for upland poor&#13;
households and the local economy. The Ministry of Labor estimated that 37 million rural&#13;
migrants in 23 large cities remitted Y 75 billion to their families. Per capita remittances&#13;
of Y 2,000 are far greater than per capita income for poor households in upland counties&#13;
(viz., Y 320 or less), and would alone be more than sufficient to achieve the 8-7 Plan&#13;
target for per capita income (of Y 500 in 1992 constant yuan) for such families. The&#13;
Guizhou Labor Bureau reported remittances of more than Y 2 billion, sent by 800,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
women and 200,000 men outside the province. In some cases, the remittances exceed the&#13;
county govemment's own annual revenues. Village interviews revealed that, even without&#13;
remittances from migrants, the upland household benefits significantly from just the&#13;
decreased demand on its meager food supply.&#13;
2.34      The potential gains from labor mobility hide significant risks that present&#13;
special challenges to indigenous peoples and women from upland areas, and for their urban&#13;
destinations. Rural workers migrating through spontaneous channels often work in coal&#13;
mines, construction sites and assembly lines and are increasingly vulnerable to illness,&#13;
accidents, sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation. The number of fires and other&#13;
on-site accidents in China has increased markedly in recent years, and in 1993 more than&#13;
2,400 people died, thousands more were injured and there was $130 million in property&#13;
damage from reported fires and accidents. Growing urban labor markets in the Yangtze&#13;
and Pearl River Deltas and southem Guangxi need large numbers of low-skill labor for&#13;
new and expanding plants. However, the presence of millions of migrants has increased&#13;
the already severe strains on urban housing, water, sewer, communications, transportation&#13;
and other services in these areas. While they recognize the economic benefits of migrant&#13;
workers, municipal authorities in many cities are concerned with the risk of large and&#13;
expanding slums in urban and peri-urban areas.&#13;
E. INCIDENCE OF POVERTY&#13;
2.35      Poverty Monitoring. An independent and effective poverty monitoring system&#13;
is vital in obtaining an accurate identification of the poor, in analyzing the accuracy of&#13;
targeting benefits, and in assessing the impact of poverty reduction activities.&#13;
Unfortunately, much work has yet to be done to establish reliable and comprehensive&#13;
estimates of poverty. Strategies found that, depending on the data source for per capita&#13;
income, estimates of poverty incidence at the provincial level can vary as much as&#13;
50 percent. While SSB administers a comprehensive rural household survey that gathers&#13;
data on provincial averages, it does not provide information at the county level-an&#13;
absolute necessity in identifying the poor and for evaluating changes in poverty. It also&#13;
does not include sufficient information on important correlates of poverty such as&#13;
household expenditures, education, health, labor mobility and credit experience. While&#13;
other sources of data exist that could augment information obtained through the SSB rural&#13;
household survey, some of that information is not collected on a systematic basis and very&#13;
little data exist on the characteristics of the bottom 5 to 10 percent of the income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
F. EThNc MnoRmr&#13;
2.36      Chinese law recognizes 55 ethnic minority groups with a total population of&#13;
about 91 million in 1990, of which about three quarters (69 million) resided in autonomous&#13;
counties, prefectures or regions. The autonomous areas have special governance features,&#13;
including requirements for minority representation in the local People's Congress and in&#13;
the local government administration. In addition, they are given special taxation and other&#13;
rights. Regardless of where they live, minority people may have other special privileges,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
such as exemption from family-size limits. As is true of all rural Chinese, minority people&#13;
have clear rights to, and effective control over, their lands and associated natural&#13;
resources.&#13;
2.37      The complex set of historical forces that traditionally marginalized China's&#13;
ethnic minorities economically have not been fully overcome by 45 years of development.&#13;
Thus, although minority people comprise less than one tenth of the total population, they&#13;
are estimated to represent between 40 and 50 percent of the number of absolute poor.&#13;
Some 257 of the 592 8-7 Plan poor counties (para. 1.14), furthermore, are minority&#13;
autonomous counties. Minority groups, including the Miao, Yao, Buyi, Zhuang and&#13;
others, represent just over one third of the population of Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan,&#13;
and comprise half the total number of project beneficiaries. In Guizhou, the population&#13;
of some project-area karst townships is composed of 60 percent Buyi households. Minority&#13;
people comprise 90 percent or more of the beneficiary population in most project&#13;
townships in Guangxi.&#13;
2.38      Geographical location and the resulting economic barriers are two of the most&#13;
important reasons for a high incidence of minority households among the absolute poor in&#13;
project areas. The lack of rural roads as well as cultural and language differences also&#13;
limit interaction with growing sectors of the economy. Marginal land, rapid deforestation&#13;
and rapid population growth combine to limit productivity and per capita income. The&#13;
process of agricultural innovation has favored areas with more flat land and adequate&#13;
irrigation, low-cost transportation, and better-developed markets, and has developed&#13;
technologies that do not fit the unique circumstances faced by the absolute poor and upland&#13;
people.&#13;
2.39      Long-term prospects are not favorable for most of the more than 1.4 million&#13;
project-area minority people. With inadequate bilingual education opportunities, and&#13;
school fees that limit access to schools in many cases, educational attainment can be very&#13;
limited. Market information gaps also restrict the household's ability to take advantage of&#13;
local and distant off-farm opportunities.&#13;
2.40      To ensure appropriate design of component activities, a process of detailed&#13;
consultation was conducted in upland communities involving village leaders, a sample of&#13;
the poorest households, village teachers, health practitioners and other members of the&#13;
community, with special attention paid to minority people. During project development,&#13;
an independent field investigation in Guangxi and Guizhou by a cultural anthropologist led&#13;
to suggestions regarding health, education and labor mobility component design and&#13;
implementation, and these were incorporated into specific component activities. NGO&#13;
(viz., Ford Foundation in Beijing and CARE Australia) staff also participated in project&#13;
preparation missions and advised on community and minority people's informed&#13;
participation in project design and implementation. Senior staff, from the national,&#13;
provincial and local levels, of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission have also&#13;
participated in project preparation and are included in the provincial and local project&#13;
leading groups (PLGs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2.41      Mechanisms have been designed to permit ongoing participation of minority&#13;
households in project areas and, since 80 percent of pilot villages comprise minority&#13;
groups, unexpected adverse impacts on minority households and villages would be detected&#13;
during the early stages of project implementation and addressed in a participatory way with&#13;
the communities. A village labor-mobility management committee would be established&#13;
to develop (a) transparent candidate selection criteria that ensure equal access to&#13;
employment opportunities to minority people, and (b) procedures that orient households&#13;
in the local language to the voluntary nature, benefits and risks of participation in labor-&#13;
mobility activities. Interviews with minority households confirmed that labor-mobility&#13;
candidates would prefer to be placed in self-selecting groups and share dormitory rooms&#13;
(Annex 4). For the social services component, strategies and a monitoring plan have been&#13;
developed to ensure that activities promote participation of minority people, including&#13;
bilingual primary school education and bilingual training of teachers (Annex 2, paras. 13,&#13;
26 and 27). The health subcomponent would serve to supplement well-established&#13;
traditional medicine practices in the project area. Minority people would have equal access&#13;
to all technical assistance, resources, services and infrastructure provided under other&#13;
project components.&#13;
G. SELECIlON OF PROJECr CoUNTIES, TowNsEps AND VILLAGES&#13;
2.42      Counties. About 25 million, or nearly one third, of China's remaining&#13;
absolute poor reside in the remote upland areas of Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. The&#13;
149 poor counties in these three provinces also comprise one quarter of the nationally&#13;
designated 8-7 Plan poor counties (para. 1.14). The 35 project counties are among the&#13;
poorest of the 8-7 Plan counties, with average rural per capita income levels ranging&#13;
between Y 160 to Y 310 and per capita grain production averaging about 200 to 220 kg&#13;
per capita. The contrasts between poverty incidence, income levels and grain production&#13;
for the project counties and the averages for the Guangxi Autonomous Region and China&#13;
are shown in Table 2.1. The incidence of rural poverty in the Guangxi project counties&#13;
is three times the provincial average and about six times the national average. Average&#13;
rural per capita income and grain production in the project counties are also substantially&#13;
less than the provincial and national averages.&#13;
2.43      Townships and Villages. The project area consists of 290 townships and&#13;
1,798 administrative villages, and comprises the poorest half of the townships in the 35&#13;
project counties and the poorer half of the administrative villages in the 290 project&#13;
townships. Principal criteria for the selection of project townships and administrative&#13;
villages were per capita income levels and grain production (below average) and the&#13;
proportion of indigenous peoples (above average). As illustrated in the maps Guangxi&#13;
Project Counties and Municipalities (IBRD No. 26629) and Puding County (Guizhou)&#13;
Project Areas (IBRD No. 26525), an effort was also made to select townships and&#13;
administrative villages in contiguous project-area blocks in order to improve ease of project&#13;
implementation. (All natural villages in the project administrative villages are included in&#13;
the project.)&#13;

2.44      The exclusion of half of the townships and three quarters of the administrative&#13;
villages in the project counties allowed for the targeting of adequate levels of investment&#13;
to the poorest villages with the greatest number of indigenous peoples. As shown in Table&#13;
2.1, nearly four fifths of the rural population in the Guangxi project townships are&#13;
absolutely poor-considerably more than the proportion (three fifths) for the Guangxi&#13;
counties. Average rural per capita income and grain production in the Guangxi project&#13;
townships are also substantially less than the provincial and national averages. In Puding&#13;
County (Guizhou), project data show that 1992 per capita agricultural output value was&#13;
20 percent greater in nonproject townships (Y 330) than in the project townships (Y 274).&#13;
Per capita grain production was 12 percent greater, and the structure of grain production&#13;
included far more preferred grain (i.e., wheat and rice), in Puding's nonproject townships&#13;
than in the project townships.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTvES AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1       The principal objectives of the project are to: (a) demonstrate the effectiveness&#13;
of a focused, multisectoral rural development project approach to poverty reduction, (b)&#13;
facilitate a "market-friendly" increase in labor mobility from the poor areas to better-off&#13;
rural and rapidly growing urban areas, (c) upgrade poverty monitoring at the national and&#13;
local levels, and (d) significantly reduce absolute poverty in 35 of the very poorest counties&#13;
in southwestern China.  The project would also stabilize or even reverse upland&#13;
environmental destruction through land and pasture improvement and soil conservation&#13;
works, and encourage greater local community participation by enabling households to&#13;
make key decisions during project design and implementation.&#13;
3.2       At present, the LGPR system at the central, provincial and local levels&#13;
(a) administers a large program of official development assistance (grants, credit and&#13;
standard loans) through the national banking system and (b) coordinates a very wide variety&#13;
of special poor-area projects and specially funded programs supported by each of 27&#13;
central ministries and agencies (para. 1.9). These existing poverty reduction programs&#13;
include nearly all sectors and known approaches to poverty reduction. However, the&#13;
various approaches have rarely been integrated at the local level, and the effectiveness of&#13;
an integrated multisectoral package of poverty reduction initiatives has certainly never been&#13;
tested on a large scale in the very poorest upland areas of China. Though much smaller&#13;
in scale and more limited in content than the proposed project, a small number of&#13;
integrated multisectoral rural development projects have been supported in China by&#13;
several international agencies including UNDP, IFAD, WFP and FAO. The successful&#13;
implementation and favorable impact of these smaller projects suggests that the proposed&#13;
project's integrated multisectoral approach will, particularly for the most severely affected&#13;
resource-deficient areas, prove far more effective in achieving a sustainable reduction of&#13;
China's remaining absolute poverty than have most existing unintegrated poverty reduction&#13;
programs. It is therefore expected that the Bank Group-supported project will become the&#13;
prototype for extension to the majority of China's other poor areas and to the overall&#13;
poverty reduction program.&#13;
B. DESCRIPION&#13;
3.3       The project would comprise the following six components:&#13;
(a)  social services, including (i) increasing the access and quality of primary&#13;
education provided to the poor through facilities construction, tuition&#13;
payments, teacher and management training, and the provision of textbooks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
and instructional equipment; and (ii) enhancing the availability and delivery&#13;
of primary and curative health care to the poor through health clinic and&#13;
township hospital renovation and construction, the establishment of a village&#13;
health cooperative fund, the strengthening of public health programs in disease&#13;
prevention and control and maternal and child health, and enhancing the&#13;
management capabilities of health administrators at the county and provincial&#13;
level;&#13;
(b)  labor mobility, through a voluntary system of enhanced rural labor mobility&#13;
for the upland absolute poor, supported by skill training through an enterprise&#13;
reimbursement system, a computerized demand-driven job placement system&#13;
emphasizing local markets, monitoring of worker safety and living conditions,&#13;
and reporting of abuses and grievances;&#13;
(c)  rural infrastructure, including the labor-intensive construction of rural roads,&#13;
safe drinking water supply systems, small-scale irrigation, agricultural&#13;
drainage works, biogas digesters, and rural electrification;&#13;
(d)  land and farmer development, using menus of crop and livestock activities&#13;
to increase upland agricultural productivity and reverse the trend of&#13;
environmental degradation through (i) extension of improved agriculture and&#13;
smallholder livestock management techniques and inputs, (ii) establishment of&#13;
tree crop nurseries and provision of saplings and tree crop management&#13;
extension (for high-altitude and red-soil varieties), (iii) intensification of staple&#13;
crop production on the modest amount of available flat land, (iv) terracing for&#13;
improved water and soil conservation, and (v) the support of provincial and&#13;
regional research;&#13;
(e)  TVE development, through support for TVEs consisting of investment credit&#13;
for labor-intensive, commercially viable agroprocessing, mineral, service and&#13;
handicraft industries that have strong backward linkages to poor households&#13;
and meet environmental safeguards; and,&#13;
(f)  institution building and poverty monitoring, through (i) improving LGPR&#13;
and PADOs' capabilities in project design and implementation, procurement,&#13;
accounting, and monitoring and evaluation; and (ii) establishing an objective&#13;
poverty monitoring system for the project areas by using improved SSB survey&#13;
instruments to provide a credible and comprehensive poverty profile, analyze&#13;
the accuracy of the targeting of benefits to the absolute poor, and measure and&#13;
evaluate the impact of the project's individual components.&#13;
The project would also directly link the economies of the project upland counties with&#13;
China's fast-growing coastal zones. For this purpose and in support of the labor mobility&#13;
component, the IBRD loan of $47.5 million would assist urban and agricultural&#13;
development activities in Beihai, Nanning and Fangcheng (Guangxi Province). Aided by&#13;
the IBRD loan, the three cities would provide at least 37,000 full-time and 17,000 seasonal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
job opportunities (over a six-year period) for the absolute poor from the project's upland&#13;
areas.&#13;
C. DETrAnFD FEATURES&#13;
Social Services&#13;
3.4       The project would facilitate the development of locally funded and managed&#13;
education and health systems for the absolute poor at the village level. The education and&#13;
health subcomponents concentrate investment in village-level basic infrastructure,&#13;
q   upgrading the quality and reliability of services, and the development of mechanisms to&#13;
ensure access to social services by the absolute poor. Both the education and health&#13;
subcomponents include mechanisms to ensure sustainability, and would completely phase&#13;
out project funding for tuition assistance, nutrition supplementation and medical assistance&#13;
by the final year of project implementation (see Annex 9, Table 10).&#13;
3.5        Education Subcomponent.  The project would address low educational&#13;
attainment among those in project areas by enhancing the delivery of primary education&#13;
to the poor. This would occur through (a) primary school renovation and construction,&#13;
(b) supporting tuition assistance and nutritional supplements for poor students, (c) the&#13;
provision of textbooks, instructional equipment and furniture, and (d) teacher and&#13;
management training. The government has recently established the national target of&#13;
universal nine-year primary education by the year 2000.  Therefore, due to the&#13;
disproportionately low levels of female enrollment and retention (para. 1.4) in the project&#13;
area, the project by definition strongly favors girls' education.&#13;
3.6        To increase access to primary education for the poor, approximately 2,400&#13;
teaching points, along with 320 center schools,l/ would be rehabilitated or constructed&#13;
and assistance in the form of beds, sheets, and cookware for 16,600 students per year&#13;
would be supported. Furthermore, because building schools does not guarantee higher&#13;
enrollment and retention rates, and in response to prohibitive school fees, the project would&#13;
provide tuition assistance equaling 60 to 100 percent of fees for 540,000 student years, or&#13;
on average, for 90,000 students per year of the project. To ensure sustainability, the&#13;
number of students receiving project tuition assistance and nutrition supplementation would&#13;
decrease during project implementation. As an additional incentive for children to attend&#13;
school and in order to enhance their ability to learn, the project would support an in-school&#13;
supplementary nutrition program to avert increased malnutrition during the interharvest&#13;
season (March to May) for 205,000 student per season or, on average, for 34,167 students&#13;
per year. To ensure proper targeting, teachers and village leaders would play a lead role&#13;
in the selection of students to benefit from tuition and nutrition assistance. The project&#13;
would also provide salaries to support 2,170 new teachers in the rural areas. To encourage&#13;
1/  A teaching point is defined as a one-room school with a teacher who teaches multiple grades or subjects&#13;
at the same time. A center school typically consists of six to eight classrooms, student and teacher&#13;
dormitories, and a physical education area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
the education of girls, a special effort would be made, over both the short and long term,&#13;
to attract qualified female teachers who could serve as role models.&#13;
3.7       To enhance the quality of primary education, approximately 12,000 teachers&#13;
would be provided with (a) full-time qualification training, (b) inservice qualification&#13;
training through correspondence education, and (c) brief periods of intensive subject-&#13;
specific inservice training (such as teaching skills necessary for multigrades and&#13;
multisubjects). In order to significantly enhance the delivery of primary education in&#13;
minority areas, approximately 3,450 teachers would be trained in bilingual teaching&#13;
methods. Training in school and educational system management would also be given to&#13;
approximately 2,800 primary school principals and educational administrators.&#13;
Furthermore, the project would equip primary schools with 900,000 library books, 2,000&#13;
sets of instructional equipment, and about 200,000 sets of tables and chairs. To enhance&#13;
project management, 13 sets of computers and printers would be provided. An assurance&#13;
was obtained at negotiations that arrangements acceptable to the Bank Group would be&#13;
made for financing, on a grant basis, the annual tuition fees for approximately 90,(000&#13;
primary school children per year, selected on the basis of criteria acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
3.8       Health Subcomponent. The project would strengthen the health network by&#13;
increasing the accessibility and enhancing the quality of health services provided to the&#13;
poor at the village and township level. This would occur primarily through facility&#13;
construction and renovation, the establishment of a cooperative health fund, training of&#13;
health personnel, strengthening of public health programs in disease prevention and control&#13;
and maternal and child health (MCH), and enhancing the management capabilities of health&#13;
administrators at the county and provincial level (Annex 31.&#13;
3.9       At the village level, the health system would be improved to more effectively&#13;
and efficiently deliver primary health care to the poor. To increase access to primary care,&#13;
the project, during its first 18 months, would either upgrade existing health clinics or&#13;
construct new ones. The project would also establish a village cooperative health fund to&#13;
provide sustainable access to basic preventive medicine and supplies. The fund would&#13;
consist of approximately Y 6 (in 1995 yuan) per capita and would be composed of annual&#13;
contributions and monies obtained through the discounted sale (equaling approximately&#13;
30 percent of cost) of pharmaceuticals (Annex 3!. Throughout the project life, the project&#13;
contribution to the fund would decrease and the community contribution would increase.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that cooperative health-care funds would be&#13;
established and thereafter maintained and adequatety funded in all project villages. To&#13;
enhance the quality of services provided, a standard set of essential equipment would be&#13;
supplied to 1,700 village health clinics. Furthermore, about 1,750 village health aides&#13;
would be trained in the delivery of primary health care in activities such as the prevention&#13;
and management of communicable diseases, health education, and support and supervision&#13;
of birth attendants. A monthly salary increment of Y 65 to Y 80 would be provided to&#13;
those village health aides who receive training; if the health aide performs according to&#13;
standard, a bonus equaling 20 percent of annual salary would be given. Training would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
also be provided to about 3,500 birth attendants in pregnancy case management and&#13;
delivery.&#13;
3.10      The health network at the township level would be strengthened to not only&#13;
provide preventive but also affordable curative health care to the poor. Access to health&#13;
services at the township level would be enhanced through expanding and improving&#13;
approximately 300 township hospitals and by subsidizing some medical services provided&#13;
to the poor. Both access and quality would be improved by (a) providing a basic set of&#13;
equipment to about 300 township hospitals, and (b) training and providing monetary&#13;
incentives to two to five existing township health workers at each hospital to undertake&#13;
preventive-care activities.&#13;
3.11      The project would also include assistance for both the disease prevention and&#13;
control and MCH programs that span village and township levels. The disease prevention&#13;
and control program would be strengthened to include (a) an effective disease surveillance&#13;
system that would systematize birth, death, and communicable disease reporting, and&#13;
(b) activities to ensure safe drinking water such as the chemical treatment and periodic&#13;
assessment of water sources. In addition, vaccines and medication would be provided for&#13;
the control of typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and neonatal tetanus. The project would assist&#13;
the MCH program by providing (a) monetary incentives to health workers and to mothers&#13;
for undertaking appropriate prenatal care and delivery practices and (b) financing to offset&#13;
the cost of complicated pregnancies that require referral to township and county hospitals.&#13;
In addition, under the MCH program, the project would develop a routine monitoring&#13;
system for childhood nutritional status.&#13;
3.12      Finally, the project would address deficiencies in health network management&#13;
at the county and provincial level through providing training to health administrators in&#13;
overall health network management, disease monitoring and control, and nutrition&#13;
surveillance. Approximately 210 persons will be trained at the county and 20 at the&#13;
provincial level.&#13;
Enhanced Rural Labor Mobility&#13;
3.13      The project would establish a voluntary labor mobility system to provide&#13;
employment to about 343,000 upland surplus laborers over six years, and provide an&#13;
important testing ground for assisting the organized flow of rural laborers into China's fast-&#13;
growing cities. Project activities build on existing institutional arrangements and systems&#13;
of the provincial Labor Bureaus, with adjustments to target upland-poor surplus laborers.&#13;
The four elements of the labor mobility system are: (a) village orientation, (b) on-the-job&#13;
training by enterprises on a cost-reimbursement basis, (c) job placement, and&#13;
(d) monitoring worker rights, job safety and living conditions. County Labor Bureaus&#13;
would target project-area poor households with the most surplus labor. Incentives and&#13;
emphasis on local job placement would encourage county Labor Bureaus to provide a&#13;
representative share of job opportunities to ethnic minorities and women. (See Annex 4&#13;
for indicative provincial and sectoral job targets.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.14      Special care would be taken to minimize the risks inherent to labor mobility.&#13;
Safety records and work conditions of joint ventures with fewer than 100 employees would&#13;
be reviewed before workers are placed, since these enterprises have the most frequently&#13;
reported cases of worker abuse and accidents (para. 2.34). The provincial and county&#13;
offices of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) would provide the project's female&#13;
migrant laborers with a special orientation on the risks of labor mobility, including sexual&#13;
exploitation. A monitoring system focusing on fair treatment of workers and workplace&#13;
safety has been designed, based on provincial and county Labor Bureau experiences.&#13;
LGPR, provincial Labor Bureaus and ACWF would be responsible for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities. Indicators would include: (a) wage and remittance levels, (b) job&#13;
safety records, (c) dormitory conditions, (d) conditions faced by women and ethnic&#13;
minority workers, (e) resolution of labor disputes involving migrants, (f) cost per job&#13;
created, (g) contract completion rates, and (h) cost recovery rates. To the greatest extent&#13;
possible, women and ethnic minorities would be placed in jobs in project counties in order&#13;
to facilitate monitoring. A comprehensive monitoring and reporting system is (a) currently&#13;
being tested in the pilot phase (para. 3.17), and (b) carefully documented in WBPO's&#13;
Labor Mobility Feasibility Study Report (November 1994). Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that (a) labor mobility would be strictly voluntary and undertaken only on the&#13;
basis of consultation procedures and relocation arrangements acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group; (b) a monitoring and reporting system satisfactory to the Bank Group, focusing on&#13;
fair treatment of workers and workplace safety, would be finalized and implemented at the&#13;
county, provincial and national levels no later than September 15, 1995; and&#13;
(c) commencing September 15, 1995, LGPR would prepare and submit a detailed labor&#13;
mobility component monitoring report to the Bank Group by March 15 and September 15&#13;
of each year.&#13;
3.15      Cost recovery through payroll deductions and remittances would contribute to&#13;
a sustainable labor mobility system. The project would conduct village visits to ensure that&#13;
these mechanisms do not cause undue hardship on upland households. Provincial and&#13;
county Labor Bureaus estimate that costs will range from Y 700 per job for local&#13;
placement to Y 2,000 for distant markets with slightly greater skill training requirements&#13;
(see Annex 4, Table 4). Fixed-cost investments amount to only Y 100 per migrant for the&#13;
first six years.&#13;
3.16      The project would establish a computerized management information system&#13;
to match surplus laborers with job opportunities. This information system would enable&#13;
a new business-oriented joint entity (para. 4.5), consisting of LGPR and the Ministry of&#13;
Labor (MOL), to spearhead labor migration from the poor project counties to fast-growing,&#13;
highly competitive markets such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. County Labor Bureaus and&#13;
TVE Bureaus would ensure that TVEs supported by the project would hire low-skill&#13;
workers through the labor mobility system. The joint entity formed by LGPR and MOL&#13;
would manage a central labor mobility component fund of Y 111 million to (a) establish&#13;
a job placement system for interprovincial labor mobility and (b) provide county Labor&#13;
Bureau staff training. LGPR would propose policy and regulatory changes to facilitate the&#13;
safe transfer of upland surplus laborers to established enterprises. These may include tax&#13;
holidays, other fiscal incentives, and a guaranteed share of work permits in large labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
markets. Effective legal sanctions would also be suggested for cases of worker abuse,&#13;
building on recently strengthened national labor regulations and increased numbers of&#13;
Labor Bureau monitoring staff.&#13;
3.17      A one-year pilot phase would allow the project to test labor mobility strategies&#13;
in local, provincial and distant markets before large-scale operations are undertaken. The&#13;
project would evaluate the use of groups, alternative remittance channels to ensure the safe&#13;
transfer of remittances, payroll deductions to cover costs, and the effectiveness of&#13;
monitoring techniques and remedies. The pilot phase would also permit the project to&#13;
incorporate findings from labor mobility research supported by MOL and the Ford&#13;
Foundation (see Annex 4!.&#13;
3.18      Guangxi Municipal Employment Development Subcomponent. A $47.5&#13;
million IBRD loan for urban and agricultural development activities in Beihai, Nanning and&#13;
Fangcheng (Guangxi Province) would support the labor mobility component (see Annex 5!.&#13;
A poverty-reduction enterprise development zone for labor-intensive industries,&#13;
unsubsidized low-cost housing schemes (slum improvement and dormitory construction for&#13;
migrant workers), mariculture, agriculture, and fast-growing tree plantations would be&#13;
supported by the subcomponent. As part of the municipal development effort, enterprises&#13;
would provide at least 37,000 full-time and 17,000 seasonal jobs in labor-intensive&#13;
industries, suburban forestry plantations, orchards and vegetable production bases, urban&#13;
infrastructure construction and other activities over a six-year period to the absolute poor&#13;
from the project's upland areas. (The 37,000 full-time positions are included in the overall&#13;
labor mobility component target of 343,000 positions.) Subcomponent activities would be&#13;
evaluated on the basis of cost per job created, income and remittance levels, and cost&#13;
recovery, and would not be related in any way to resettlement or relocation programs.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that participating project enterprises would be&#13;
eligible for financing under the project only upon agreement with Beihai, Nanning or&#13;
Fangcheng municipality that the enterprise would adopt a business development plan&#13;
providing that at least 70 percent of the full-time jobs created in those enterprises would&#13;
be reserved for the absolute poor from the project's upland counties.&#13;
3.19      The subcomponent's two most innovative activities are the Beihai Poverty&#13;
Reduction Enterprise Zone (BPREZ) and low-cost housing in Nanning and Fangcheng.&#13;
BPREZ would provide serviced land or factory building space under preleasing agreements&#13;
for about 40 firms and create permanent employment for 8,000 migrant workers.&#13;
Incentives would be offered to small- and medium-size, nonpolluting, labor-intensive&#13;
enterprises. Based on a preliminary review, these are likely to be in the garment, food&#13;
processing and component manufacturing sectors.  Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that (a) Beihai Municipality would undertake a program of site and building&#13;
sales and leases for BPREZ satisfactory to the Bank Group, and (b) funding would be made&#13;
available only against expenditures for buildings that would be rented or sold when&#13;
acceptable prelease or presale agreements, as appropriate, have been concluded with&#13;
respect to at least 50 percent of the floor space of the building concerned. In Nanning,&#13;
low-income dormitory housing would be provided on a vacant 4.3 ha site in Beihu District&#13;
for 29,000 single migrant workers, while Fangcheng would provide housing for 17,500&#13;
migrants on a 3.5 ha site. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the low-income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
housing provided under the project would be (a) designed and constructed according to&#13;
criteria satisfactory to the Bank Group, and (b) exclusively rented for a period not less&#13;
than 10 years following completion to migrant workers from poor areas, of which not less&#13;
than 70 percent would be workers from the project counties in Guangxi.&#13;
Rural Infrastructure&#13;
3.20      The project would support the construction of rural roads, water supply&#13;
systems, small-scale irrigation, agricultural drainage, soil conservation works, biogas&#13;
digesters and small-scale rural electrification (see Annex 6).&#13;
3.21      Roads and Water Supply. The project would construct about 1,600 km of&#13;
class IV and lower-grade gravel roads in order to link 565 villages in remote mountainous&#13;
areas to the existing network of county roads. Roads would have a minimum formation&#13;
width of 4.5 m and a 3.5-m-wide carriageway designed for 10-ton vehicular loading.&#13;
Low-cost water supply facilities would be provided to 663,000 people in 990 villages.&#13;
Facilities would include piped systems with public hydrants, rain collectors, and water&#13;
storages to sustain supply up to 100 days in the dry seasons. Systems would be designed&#13;
to supply 25 to 40 liters per capita per day and would meet current water quality standards&#13;
for rural water supply in China.&#13;
3.22      Power. The project would also address the power needs of project areas by&#13;
increasing access to electricity and altemative forms of energy. To meet the power&#13;
required for agroprocessing, other light industry and mining, 197 km of 35 kV and 675 km&#13;
of 10 kV transmission lines and associated transformers and equipment, as well as two&#13;
minihydro plants would be installed. About 2,400 biogas digesters for cooking and&#13;
lighting would be provided to decrease dependence on scarce fuelwood. The project would&#13;
also provide some 2,840 improved stoves, which could reduce household fuelwood&#13;
consumption by up to 50 percent.&#13;
3.23      Soil Conservation, Irrigation and Drainage.  The project would also&#13;
construct and improve soil conservation, irrigation and drainage works for 15,600 ha of&#13;
existing and new rice paddy and upland crops. Irrigation improvement would include the&#13;
upgrading of the Fengguo Reservoir in Yunnan Province through increasing the storage&#13;
capacity of the existing reservoir, constructing 3 km of trunk tunnel canal and completing&#13;
the canal system, and terracing of land to be brought under irrigation. An assurance was&#13;
obtained at negotiations that any dams improved under the project exceeding 10 m in&#13;
height or 2.5 million cubic meters in storage volume would be subject to dam safety&#13;
review. All dams rehabilitated or constructed under the project would subsequently be&#13;
maintained and inspected periodically in accordance with sound engineering practices,&#13;
under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
Land and Farmer Development&#13;
3.24      The objective of the land and farmer development component is to create a&#13;
substantial and sustainable increase in the agricultural incomes of the more than 600,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
households in the project area. This would be achieved through the development of&#13;
improved integrated land use systems including environmentally sound and farmer-&#13;
determined technologies for food, cash and tree crops, household animal husbandry&#13;
activities, land development, and aquaculture, and through increased access to agricultural&#13;
extension and inputs such as seeds. The project would support (a) the establishment of a&#13;
wide range of tree crops that would provide cash income over the long term while helping&#13;
to control soil erosion, (b) household animal husbandry that would be a source of cash&#13;
income in the near term (and supply organic fertilizer), and (c) land development and&#13;
improved food production as a means of increasing household food supplies and cash&#13;
incomes. Agricultural development activities supported and monitored by the project will&#13;
be integrated into comprehensive village-development schemes. Technologies would be&#13;
selected in order to maintain low levels of economic and production risks for farmers.&#13;
Households would select activities from a menu of agricultural investment options, and&#13;
would be expected to diversify into at least two agricultural activities. Investments would&#13;
cover the initial two to five years before the first marketable crop is harvested. An upper&#13;
limit in the investment per household has been established to allow equitable access to&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
3.25      Tree Crops and Forestry. Most project households would take part in the&#13;
development of some 35 species of perennial crops on 56,100 ha of steeply sloped&#13;
"wastelands. " These wastelands are at present either under degraded vegetation cover or&#13;
planted with very low-yield corn. One fourth of this area would be planted to nut trees&#13;
and one fourth to tree and bush species, which are adapted to shallow karst soils or to&#13;
higher elevations, such as Eucommia, bamboo or Sichuan pepper. Low-elevation red-soil&#13;
hills would be planted to tea and fruit trees. In addition, some 4,700 ha of mulberry and&#13;
10,100 ha of annual cash crops, one third of it being medicinal plants, would gradually&#13;
replace corn on lower-yielding fields. Some 11,200 ha of timber plantations and 8,200 ha&#13;
of regenerative fuelwood forest in karst villages would also be developed. (A complete&#13;
list of species names, related products and areas is provided in Annex 7.) It is believed&#13;
that long-term tenure rights are essential to the improved and more sustainable utilization&#13;
of wastelands, and that those lands should be contracted to poor area farmers free of&#13;
charge. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that project farmers would receive use&#13;
rights for a term of not less than 50 years for the wastelands and other lands they plant&#13;
to perennial crops under the project.&#13;
3.26      Most plantations would be village production bases, 1 to 5 ha in size, under&#13;
individual contracts with project households.  Technical assistance for production&#13;
technology, transport and marketing would be provided by the extension service or by fruit&#13;
companies to farmers joining bases, as well as to farmers planting a small number of trees&#13;
in their home gardens. Densities and fertilizer application rates would be selected in order&#13;
to ensure the quality and longevity of tree crop production. Technical support, including&#13;
selection of varieties, plantation design and soil analysis, would be provided by province&#13;
and county specialists. The project would establish a sustainable network of nurseries,&#13;
including a central nursery set up in each project county and village nurseries managed by&#13;
specialized farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
3.27      Animal Husbandry. The project would also assist some 300,000 households&#13;
to develop animal breeding and fattening activities including 88,000 cattle, 230,000 goats,&#13;
100,000 pigs and 640,000 chickens. The southern half of the project area would focus on&#13;
goats. On-farm fodder production would be developed to provide 70 percent of the&#13;
requirements of incremental animal numbers in Guangxi, and 35 percent in Yunnan and&#13;
Guizhou. This fodder production would be based on local trees interplanted with food&#13;
crops, on a range of both local and introduced forage species intercropped with newly&#13;
planted orchards, and on 2,900 ha of upgraded pasture in Yunnan. Some 79,000&#13;
households would build ammoniated straw tanks for feeding corn stalks to cattle and goats.&#13;
Part of the corn stalk and other crop residues would be processed into feed by 200 small&#13;
electrical milling machines in administrative villages. A few counties would expand their&#13;
ongoing pond and cage fish culture activities in order to include project households.&#13;
3.28      Food Crops. Land development, using farmers' own labor, would comprise&#13;
the rehabilitation of some 4,200 ha of terraces. The terracing of upland areas in Yunnan&#13;
would be combined with small water tanks to allow supplementary irrigation during the&#13;
spring drought. A package including fertilizers and seeds would be provided during the&#13;
first year of village project activities to improve corn production on 41,300 ha, and potato&#13;
seed would be supplied for 2,300 ha in Yunnan. Some county seed companies would be&#13;
upgraded in order to supply quality seeds adapted to farmers' needs and taste preferences.&#13;
An assurance was obtained at negotiations that project farmers would receive exclusive&#13;
land use rights for a term of not less than 30 years for existing cropland they develop or&#13;
improve under the project.&#13;
3.29      Extension and Training. A total of 3,600 farmers would form an expanded&#13;
network of demonstration households with 180 ha of demonstration fields on their farms.&#13;
These households would be trained as farmer-technicians specializing in tree crops or&#13;
animal husbandry. A representative number of new demonstration households would be&#13;
minority people and women farmers. In addition, 320,000 farmers would attend an&#13;
average of four days of technical and management training. The project would also&#13;
provide 290 small pickups to enable technicians to increase their visits to project villages&#13;
and demonstration households and to facilitate transportation of input supplies. About&#13;
1,200 township technicians would join annual five-day training sessions in county extension&#13;
centers, and 350 county-level technicians would be trained in the counties or in provincial&#13;
capitals. The project would also assist the provincial research institutes to initiate on-farm&#13;
research. This research work would help identify farmers' needs in land use improvement&#13;
in karst and high-elevation areas, and would design specific low-cost technologies. The&#13;
project would encourage the transfer of these technologies through revised county extension&#13;
plans.&#13;
TVE Development&#13;
3.30      TVEs are a cost-effective means of creating stable jobs for unskilled workers&#13;
and spurring economic development in small towns and rural areas. All TVE investments&#13;
provisionally accepted for inclusion in this project were proposed, and are sponsored by,&#13;
local governments in the project provinces, counties, townships, and villages. They were&#13;
subjected to five selection criteria to maximize benefits to the poor: (a) cost per job&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
created, (b) commercial feasibility, (c) worker safety and environmental risks, (d) skills&#13;
training, and (e) backward linkages to poor households. Selected TVEs would add&#13;
significant local value to existing and planned agriculture and mineral production.&#13;
Commercial feasibility has been analyzed by reviewing trends in demand and prices in&#13;
local, regional and national markets. Proposed TVEs that did not meet the five criteria&#13;
and were eliminated included a blast furnace, lead processing, sulfur and nitrate mines and&#13;
cement plants. About one third of the proposals were rejected, and another third were&#13;
modified during preparation. Inevitable replacement proposals would be subjected to the&#13;
same criteria and process during project implementation.&#13;
3.31      TVE Portfolio Composition.  The TVE component would support 209&#13;
enterprises, amounting to a total investment of Y 478 million. The component would&#13;
support expansion or creation of 95 agroprocessing firms, 26 mining operations,&#13;
8 companies providing services, and 4 handicraft manufacturers, creating 29,500 low-skill&#13;
jobs in local towns. Agroprocessing activities include silk reeling, forest products, tea,&#13;
fruits and a wide range of local food and medicinal products. The average TVE&#13;
investment would be Y 2.2 million, and would provide employment for 140 upland&#13;
migrants, at a cost of Y 25,500 ($3,000) per job. Women would make up at least&#13;
80 percent of the labor force in some sectors, such as carpet weaving, embroidery and fruit&#13;
processing.&#13;
3.32      Seventy-six farmers' markets would be established to provide poor farmers in&#13;
project areas with affordable access to inputs and profitable outlets for products. These&#13;
represent a total investment of about Y 30 million, at a unit cost of Y 390,000. The&#13;
location of farmers' markets would be linked to rural road construction. Each province&#13;
has selected three farmers' markets for the one-year pilot phase, which would be evaluated&#13;
based on the following: (a) access to affordable inputs by poor households, (b) market&#13;
prices for products made by poor farmers, and (c) market occupancy rates and financial&#13;
sustainability. Based on an evaluation of the nine pilot farmers' markets, adjustments&#13;
would be made to the design, number and location of the remaining markets in latter years&#13;
of the project.&#13;
3.33      Backward Linkages. TVEs would be integrated to agricultural activities&#13;
supported by the project. This strategy ensures that economic gains from value-added&#13;
processing would support the local economy and absorb surplus labor. It also guarantees&#13;
a local market for crops such as longan and silkworm cocoons. Since backward linkages&#13;
offer significant benefits, a key indicator of TVE success would be the share of raw&#13;
materials provided by farmers from project areas.&#13;
3.34      Worker Safety and Environmental Risks. All TVEs would meet existing&#13;
national environmental standards for water, soil, and air quality and noise pollution. The&#13;
TVE feasibility studies include assessment of environmental risks and risk-abatement&#13;
precautions. The studies have been reviewed by the provincial and county Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureaus (EPBs), which must approve new and expanded TVE facilities under&#13;
national regulations. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the provincial EPBs&#13;
would (a) deternine which of these TVEs would require effluent treatment facilities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(b) review and approve the final designs of the necessary effluent treatment facilides prior&#13;
to beginning construcdon, and (c) supervise the plant's implementation and maintenance&#13;
of effluent monitoring and treatment systems. PMO environmental assessment and&#13;
monitoring units (EUs, para. 4.4) would also confirm that the appropriate EPB has issued&#13;
full environmental clearance for each TVE.&#13;
3.35      Key monitoring indicators include wage and remittance levels, enterprise&#13;
profitability and worker safety records. In addition, in cases in which land acquisition is&#13;
required for TVE development, the payment of timely and adequate compensation will be&#13;
monitored, based on Chinese regulations and Bank Group policy. Food processing TVEs&#13;
would be subject to regular sanitary inspections by local health authorities. In accordance&#13;
with Bank Group regulations, no TVEs will be involved in tobacco production or&#13;
processing.&#13;
Institution Building and Poverty Monitoring&#13;
3.36      Institution Building. Careful implementation of the project requires that the&#13;
PADOs and PMOs be greatly strengthened, particularly at the central and provincial levels.&#13;
To this end, an institutional development program to strengthen the PADOs and PMOs&#13;
would be implemented as an integral part of the project. The program would include:&#13;
(a) institutional design, including the design of organizational setup, definition of functions&#13;
and formulation of policies and procedures; (b) human resource development, including&#13;
training and technical assistance; (c) provision of facilities, including office space, office&#13;
furniture and equipment and vehicles; and (d) development of a computer-based&#13;
information system to facilitate project management. Due to the program-lending nature&#13;
of the project, special attention would be paid to upgrading the PADOs' and PMOs'&#13;
abilities in development planning, project selection and appraisal, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of project implementation.&#13;
3.37      Research, Training and Technical Assistance. The project would fund&#13;
research, local and overseas training, study tours and technical assistance comprising both&#13;
foreign and local consultants. Each project component (except for rural infrastructure and&#13;
TVE development) includes research, training and technical assistance (Annex 9). Except&#13;
for technical assistance for institution building ($1 million), all project technical assistance&#13;
would support project preparation and implementation. An assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that (a) all training, including study tours, and research under the project&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with training and research programs agreed with the&#13;
Bank Group, and (b) the WBPO would provide an annual plan to the Bank Group by&#13;
December I of each year that would include a list of proposed research, training, study&#13;
tours and technical assistance for the coming year.&#13;
3.38      Poverty Monitoring. The establishment of an objective poverty-monitoring&#13;
system is essential to achieving the project's principal objective of demonstrating the&#13;
effectiveness of a focused, multisectoral, rural development project approach to poverty&#13;
reduction. In collaboration with ongoing PRDPH work with SSB (para. 1.8), the project&#13;
would develop such a system for the project areas using improved survey instruments. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
system would provide a credible and comprehensive poverty profile for the project areas,&#13;
analyze the accuracy of targeting benefits to the absolute poor, and measure and evaluate&#13;
the impact of the project's individual components. It would provide an important testing&#13;
ground for assisting in the establishment of a national poverty monitoring system that&#13;
would, in turn, serve as a crucial underpinning for the government's overall poverty-&#13;
reduction program.&#13;
3.39      The four main elements of the poverty monitoring system are (a) upgrading&#13;
SSB's existing rural household survey, (b) carrying out pilot, baseline and annual follow-up&#13;
surveys, (c) processing and analyzing the collected survey data, and (d) disseminating&#13;
findings and information (Annex 8!. The project poverty-monitoring system would build&#13;
upon SSB's existing survey instruments, with adjustments to target project areas, by&#13;
decreasing the number of entries and by improving individual and community modules to&#13;
incorporate important questions on household expenditure, education, health, labor mobility&#13;
and credit experience. A pilot area survey of 600 of the poorest project households was&#13;
completed in September 1994 to provide a socioeconomic profile of the absolute poor. For&#13;
the baseline and annual follow-up surveys, SSB would design, test and modify&#13;
questionnaires during the first half of 1995. The baseline survey would be undertaken in&#13;
December 1995 and follow-up surveys would be carried out annually in December for the&#13;
remainder of the project. LGPR and SSB would collaborate on data processing and&#13;
analysis and the publication of an annual summary report.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.40      Feasibility studies have been completed for the three provinces and all 35&#13;
project counties, including representative designs for all the subprojects, and&#13;
comprehensive development plans for 105 administrative villages. The three provincial&#13;
studies and the studies for 11 of the 35 counties have been thoroughly reviewed by the&#13;
Bank Group (5 counties) and WBPO and provincial PMOs (all 11 counties) prior to and&#13;
during appraisal.  Extensive revisions have been made in accordance with the&#13;
recommendations of these reviews. In accordance with the principles and standards agreed&#13;
during the project preparation and appraisal, the provincial PMOs have now thoroughly&#13;
reviewed the remainder of the feasibility studies. Implementation of (a) pilot programs for&#13;
the labor mobility and social services components, (b) several of the comprehensive village&#13;
development program in selected counties, (c) the full range of project components in&#13;
Mashan County, and (d) institution building at the central and provincial levels began in&#13;
January 1995. During the early stages of implementation, and in accordance with the&#13;
govemment's basic investment project review and approval process and Bank Group&#13;
regulations, detailed implementation plans and engineering designs for each project&#13;
component would be carefully reviewed by the PMOs at all levels and concerned technical&#13;
departments.&#13;
3.41      Feasibility studies for the Guangxi municipal employment development&#13;
subcomponent have also been completed and appraised by the Bank Group. Representative&#13;
designs and detailed layouts have been completed for the BPREZ, low-income housing,&#13;
aquaculture, forestry and agriculture subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
E. IMPLEMNTAnON SCHEDULE&#13;
3.42      The project would be implemented during a period of six years beginning in&#13;
August 1995, with completion in July 2001. The social services component would be&#13;
implemented in a five-year period. Except for the livestock and aquaculture subprojects,&#13;
which would be finished in three years beginning in 1995, the land and farmer&#13;
development component would be phased over a six-year period.  For the rural&#13;
infrastructure component, the water supply and fuel-saving stove subprojects would be&#13;
completed in three years, while the power, roads and irrigation subprojects would be&#13;
scheduled over five years. Rural industrial and agroprocessing projects would also be&#13;
scheduled for five years due to the flexibility needed to respond to the changing market&#13;
situation. The labor mobility component would be implemented in two phases, with&#13;
careful review scheduled between the phases (para. 3.17). A phased approach is also&#13;
designed for the farmers' markets subproject (para. 3.32). Implementation of the Guangxi&#13;
municipal employment development subcomponent activities would be completed within&#13;
three to five years, depending upon the activity.&#13;
F. PRoJEcr CoT   AND FINANCING&#13;
3.43      Costs. The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at Y 4.23 billion ($486.4 million). The foreign exchange costs are estimated to&#13;
be Y 1.27 billion ($146 million), or 30 percent of the total. Taxes and duties are not&#13;
included in the estimated costs. The cost estimates are based on unit prices currently&#13;
prevailing in the project area and derived from typical designs (paras. 3.40 and 3.41).&#13;
Base cost is expressed in January 1995 prices. Physical contingencies average about&#13;
5 percent of base cost. Price contingency estimates average about 25 percent of base cost,&#13;
and have been calculated for both foreign and local costs using the Bank Group's estimated&#13;
annual escalation factors (reported in para. 9 of Annex 5).  Physical and price&#13;
contingencies amount to $1 11 million and represent 30 percent of the base cost. Estimated&#13;
project costs are summarized in Table 3.1 and detailed in Annex 9.&#13;
3.44      FSnancing. The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 128.6 million ($200 million&#13;
equivalent) and IBRD Loan of $47.5 million would cover about 51 percent of total project&#13;
costs and all of the foreign exchange component. The remaining project costs would be&#13;
financed by central and local govemments and the beneficiaries as follows:&#13;

G. PRocuREmEO&#13;
3.45         Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.2.&#13;
3.46         Works.  Civil works worth about $211.2 million would be required for the&#13;
project, including earth and stone work, structures for irrigation and rural water supply&#13;
systems, roads and rural electricity, buildings, and crop establishment and livestock&#13;
maintenance. These works would be scattered over 40 counties and municipalities and&#13;
carried out over four years, and would be too dispersed to be of interest to international&#13;
construction companies. As a result, no ICB procurement of works is planned. Instead,&#13;
about $70 million of civil works would be procured through national competitive bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank Group for construction of roads and larger&#13;
structures and buildings. The maximum size of contract to be let through NCB would be&#13;
no more than $2.5 million. Other civil works amounting to about $51 million, comprising&#13;
land development, minor structures and buildings, and village roads, would be too small,&#13;
labor-intensive, and widely scattered to be suitable for competitive contracting, and would&#13;
be undertaken through force account by local labor forces (mostly farmers) mobilized by&#13;
counties and townships. Crop establishment ($75 million) and livestock maintenance ($16&#13;
million) works would be undertaken through force account by participating farmers.&#13;
3.47         Goods. Goods worth about $143.6 million would be required for the project.&#13;
International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for steel, fertlizer,&#13;
plastic sheeting, vehicles, and computers (about $42 million, or nearly one third of all&#13;
goods). Qualified domestic bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a 15 percent&#13;
preference in bid evaluation, or customs duties and import tax payable by a nonexempt&#13;

- 39 -&#13;
3.48      NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank Group, in which foreign suppliers may&#13;
participate, would be used to procure contracts under $200,000 totaling about $73 million&#13;
worth of goods, including small agricultural and agroprocessing machinery and equipment&#13;
(totaling about $22 million), school, health and other office equipment (totaling about $5&#13;
million), and some construction materials, agricultural inputs, and most breeding stock&#13;
(totaling about $47 million). Due to its limited shelf life and the need to supply numerous&#13;
scattered project sites and the limited handling and storage capacity in the project area,&#13;
cement would be procured under NCB in small batches not exceeding 100 tons per batch.&#13;
Therefore, following annual NCB, provincial and county PMOs would place orders with&#13;
cement suppliers covering their annual needs, with deliveries staged to suit the&#13;
requirements during the year. Pesticides and specialized agroprocessing and research&#13;
equipment ($7 million) would be procured though limited international bidding since there&#13;
are only a limited number of suppliers of such specialized items who could offer&#13;
competitive prices. (ICB would therefore not be the most economic and efficient method&#13;
of procurement for such products.) All contracts under $50,000 for goods would be&#13;
procured through national shopping in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group. National shopping would total $15.4 million and would cover some breeding&#13;
animals and fattening pigs, seeds and seedlings, and small quantities of equipment,&#13;
instruments and miscellaneous goods.&#13;
3.49      Other Procurement.  Tuition assistance, nutrition supplementation, and&#13;
medical assistance ($20.3 million), labor training and placement ($51.2 million), and&#13;
research, training, and technical assistance ($29.9 million) would be carried out based on&#13;
programs agreed with the Bank Group. Consultants would be employed in accordance&#13;
with the Bank Group Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.2/ Certain incremental&#13;
recurrent operating costs of project management would be paid against an agreed schedule&#13;
of costs.&#13;
3.50      Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. Bidding documents for works&#13;
contracts estimated to exceed $2 million in value and goods packages in excess of&#13;
$200,000 would be subject to prior review by the Bank Group. This would cover&#13;
approximately 20 goods packages over the six-year implementation period. Consistent with&#13;
the relatively small size and diverse nature of the goods, this would represent about&#13;
30 percent of total goods by value. Bidding documents for the first three works and goods&#13;
contracts to be let through NCB in each province, and consultants' contracts estimated to&#13;
exceed $100,000 in the case of firms and $50,000 in the case of individual consultants,&#13;
would also be subject to prior review by the Bank Group. Standard bidding documents&#13;
approved by the Bank Group would be used.J/ Other contracts would be subject to&#13;

3.51      Proceeds of the Bank Group loan and credit would be disbursed as summarized&#13;
in Table 3.3. Disbursement for vehicles, farm machinery, equipment for agroprocessing&#13;
and other TVEs, equipment and instruments for the health and education component,&#13;
breeding stock, construction materials, laboratory equipment, fertilizer, farm chemicals,&#13;
and plastic sheeting would be at 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of imported&#13;
items and 100 percent of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured items. Disbursement&#13;
for other goods procured locally would be 75 percent. Disbursement for tuition assistance&#13;
and medical assistance would be at 100 percent of total costs (see Annex 9, Tables 2, 3&#13;
and 10). Overseas and domestic training, study tours, and international and domestic&#13;
consultant services would also be 100 percent of total costs. Disbursement for labor&#13;
training and placement under the labor mobility component would be 70 percent of total&#13;
costs (see Annex 9, Table 4). Disbursement for research and project management would&#13;
be at 50 percent of total costs. Disbursement for crop establishment, livestock and&#13;
aquaculture tending, irrigation works, terracing, water supply, roads, rural electrification,&#13;
biogas, fuel-saving stoves would average 26 percent of total expenditures. Disbursement&#13;
for the Guangxi municipal employment development subcomponent would be made only&#13;
from the Bank loan.&#13;
3.52      Disbursement for the first three contracts for goods and works under NCB for&#13;
each province, for works contracts over $2 million equivalent, goods contracts over&#13;
$200,000 equivalent, and for consultancy contracts over $100,000 equivalent for firms and&#13;
$50,000 equivalent for individuals would be made on the basis of full documentation.&#13;
Disbursement for contracts for works, goods, and consultant contracts below those amounts&#13;
and all training would be on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
Disbursements would also be made against SOEs in the case of tuition and medical&#13;
assistance, labor training and placement, research, project management, study tours, and&#13;
works carried out by farmers. SOEs would be supported by progress reports showing&#13;
physical quantities and unit prices (the latter would be updated annually by WBPO and&#13;
provincial PMOs and reviewed by the Bank Group). Supporting documentation would be&#13;
retained by PMOs and made available to Bank Group supervision missions.&#13;
3.53      The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001 and the closing date&#13;
would be December 31, 2001. China enjoys a favorable record in project implementation&#13;
and disbursement superior to Bank Group and Asia averages. The project disbursement&#13;
profile is consistent with other rural development projects in China. The estimated&#13;
disbursement schedule is given in Annex 11.&#13;
3.54      Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement, two Special Accounts, one for&#13;
the credit and one for the loan, will be established in a bank acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;
The Special Account for the credit will have an authorized allocation of $11 million, which&#13;
is the four-month estimated average disbursement through that Account. The Special&#13;
Account for the loan will have an authorized allocation of $3 million. Applications for&#13;

3.55      Retroactive Financing. Due to the need to (a) initiate the social services,&#13;
labor mobility, and institution-building components; (b) establish tree nurseries and&#13;
undertake some land preparation; (c) begin the full range of activities and the village&#13;
comprehensive development programs in selected "prototype" counties (e.g., Mashan&#13;
County in Guangxi); and (d) test selected activities under the Guangxi municipal&#13;
employment development subcomponent prior to the startup of the other project&#13;
components, retroactive financing is recommended for expenditures incurred for these&#13;
activities after January 1, 1995 and before the date of signing of the Loan/Credit&#13;
Agreements. The total disbursable amount would be up to $24.75 million equivalent.&#13;

component expenditures. These records would be forwarded regularly to WBPO, whose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
financial section would consolidate the accounts for review and audit. Assurances were&#13;
obtained that consolidated accounts would be maintained for annual auditing by auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank Group and that the audited accounts, including the Special Account,&#13;
together with the auditor's report would be submitted to the Bank Group within six months&#13;
of the close of each fiscal year. Audited accounts would include details on: use of the&#13;
Special Account, withdrawals from the Loan/Credit account made on the basis of SOEs,&#13;
and the auditors' opinion as to whether such withdrawals were made against expenditures&#13;
eligible for Bank Group disbursement.&#13;
J. ENViRONMETAL AND SOCIAL IMPAcr&#13;
3.57      Overall, the project is expected to have a favorable environmental impact. The&#13;
land and farmer development component would make significant contributions to the&#13;
mitigation of the existing environmental problems in the project areas of severe soil erosion&#13;
and degraded vegetative cover (para. 6.5). To avoid one of the few potential negative&#13;
impacts of project activities, assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) pesticides&#13;
to be provided under the project would be approved by the Bank Group and would be&#13;
stored and handled in accordance with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank Group, and&#13;
(b) all project actvities would comply with environmental standards satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank Group, necessary mitigation actions would be taken, and actions taken to fulfill the&#13;
recommendations contained in the Environmental Assessment Report would be included in&#13;
the annual work programs forwarded to the Bank Group.&#13;
3.58      Other components would take all necessary actions to minimize negative effects&#13;
on the environment.  One of the five TVE selection criteria examines the likely&#13;
environmental impact, and this has led to the elimination of several proposed ventures&#13;
(para. 3.30). TVEs supported by the project would address environmental issues during&#13;
the design stage by submitting plans to the provincial and county EPBs, thereby meeting&#13;
national pollution control requirements. During this review process, special attention has&#13;
been and would be given to controlling emissions and effluents that are byproducts of&#13;
production processes. Food processing TVEs would also be subject to regular sanitary&#13;
inspections by local health authorities. In addition, all housing and enterprise activities&#13;
supported by the Guangxi municipal employment development subcomponent would take&#13;
precautions to minimize and control emissions and effluents.&#13;
3.59      TVE establishment and expansion and other project activities would require&#13;
acquisition of less than 350 ha of cultivated land. Current land acquisition plans do not&#13;
require the involuntary resettlement of people, and the Bank Group would not approve&#13;
(during project implementation) any changes to the project or land acquisition plans that&#13;
would require involuntary resettlement of people.  Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that (a) all proposed land acquisition required for project activities would be&#13;
reviewed by county, prefectural or provincial land administration bureaus in accordance&#13;
with existing national regulations; (b) the existing land administration system for valuation&#13;
of land and other assets affected by the project would be used, with plans for compensation&#13;
in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group; and (c) land&#13;
acquisition and compensation actvities undertaken due to project activities would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
monitored by the PMOs and included in the semiannual progress reports to be provided&#13;
to the Bank Group (para. 4.17).&#13;
3.60      Social Aspects.  The project's components also directly address the&#13;
fundamental social problems in the project area of grossly inadequate educational&#13;
attainment, excessive morbidity and mortality, severe underemployment, and the lack of&#13;
access to roads, safe drinking water and electricity. During project preparation, there has&#13;
been careful targeting of the poorest upland counties, townships and villages, and the&#13;
project has a correspondingly high share of ethnic minorities, far in excess of the national&#13;
and provincial shares (para. 2.36). The education subcomponent includes inservice&#13;
bilingual education training and the recruitment of women teachers and administrators, and&#13;
strongly favors girls' primary education (para. 3.5).&#13;
3.61      The most significant social risks are related to the participation of large&#13;
numbers of women and indigenous people in the innovative labor mobility component.&#13;
Special attention has been given to the enterprise selection process and orientation of&#13;
voluntary migrants, and an important role has been defined for ACWF in this process&#13;
(para. 3.14). Incentives would be provided to encourage local TVEs to provide low-skill&#13;
employment to representative numbers of women and indigenous people consistent with&#13;
their large share of the project population, and all new low-skill jobs created by TVEs that&#13;
receive support from the project would be filled in large part with women and minorities&#13;
in coordination with the local Labor Bureau. This affirmative-action approach would not&#13;
have negative effects since many sectors, such as handicrafts and agroprocessing, tend to&#13;
have 60 to 80 percent female staff. The emphasis on local labor markets for more&#13;
vulnerable groups such as women and indigenous people would minimize job turnover due&#13;
to inappropriate placement and the risk of sexual exploitation, which is more prominent&#13;
in large coastal labor markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1       Summary. LGPR and its World Bank Project Office (WBPO) would have&#13;
principal responsibility for overall project implementation. At the provincial level, Project&#13;
Leading Groups (PLGs) have been set up to (a) mobilize institutional, technical and&#13;
financial resources and support for the preparation and implementation of the project; and&#13;
(b) provide a critical coordination and monitoring function.  In addition, Project&#13;
Management Offices (PMOs) have been established to ensure effective and timely&#13;
implementation of the project. The complexity of the project requires that WBPO and&#13;
provincial PMOs be greatly strengthened. An institutional development program to&#13;
strengthen WBPO and provincial PMOs would be implemented as an integral part of the&#13;
project (para. 3.36). At the county level, PLGs and PMOs have also been set up. The&#13;
several technical Bureaus directly involved in the project would, in close cooperation with&#13;
the township government and their offices at the administrative village level, play a key&#13;
role in the day-to-day implementation of the project. At both the central and provincial&#13;
levels, Technical Advisory Groups have been set up to provide technical support for the&#13;
project implementation. The general organization of the project is shown in Chart 1.&#13;
4.2       Central Level. The project is an integral part of the government's 8-7 Plan&#13;
(para. 1.12), and LGPR would be the decision-making body of the project and would take&#13;
full responsibility in coordinating various government agencies in the implementation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
4.3       WBPO would serve as the secretariat for LGPR on all project-related matters,&#13;
and would be responsible for the management of overall project implementation. WBPO&#13;
would provide guidance and assistance to PMOs at lower levels in subproject selection and&#13;
appraisal, and would have responsibility for overall project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
WBPO would also be directly responsible for the implementation of the interprovincial part&#13;
of the labor mobility component and part of the institutional development component of the&#13;
project. Other responsibilities of WBPO include: arranging combined procurement under&#13;
ICB and international shopping; preparing applications for withdrawals from the credit and&#13;
loan proceeds; arranging the preparation of consolidated accounting, auditing and progress&#13;
reports, including the implementation completion report; coordinating institutional&#13;
development aspects, particularly overseas training, study tours and technical assistance;&#13;
and providing liaison with the Bank. During the course of project preparation, LGPR's&#13;
WBPO was established with Bureau-level status and approved for 30 professional-level&#13;
staff positions. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that WBPO would be staffed&#13;
at levels, and maintained with functions and responsibilities, acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
4.4       Two Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) have been set up at the national level&#13;
to provide technical support to LGPR and WBPO. Comprised of senior staff of the&#13;
Chinese Academy of Sciences, one TAG provides support on both key technical issues for&#13;
project preparation and implementation. The other TAG, which is primarily staffed with&#13;
senior consultants with a great deal of experience in the preparation and implementation&#13;
of the Bank Group's projects in China, provides support on detailed technical issues and&#13;
issues related to the organization of project implementation. In addition, the Chinese&#13;
Academy of Sciences (CAS) has sent at least one staff to each of the 35 project counties.&#13;
These CAS staff have taken positions as deputy county heads, and are responsible for&#13;
technical issues of the project. Also, in close collaboration with WBPO, SSB is directly&#13;
involved in the design and implementation of the project's poverty monitoring&#13;
subcomponent (para. 3.39). Environmental assessment and monitoring units (EUs) would&#13;
be established within the central and provincial PMOs in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference that were finalized during negotiations. The terms of reference require that&#13;
funding for individual TVEs be made available by the project provinces only after the EU&#13;
has confirmed that the appropriate EPB has issued full environmental clearances for the&#13;
proposed enterprise. The EU will also include a land acquisition specialist to advise on&#13;
the implementation of timely compensation of people affected by project land acquisition&#13;
(para. 3.59).&#13;
4.5       A new joint entity formed by LGPR and MOL would manage the project's&#13;
central labor mobility component fund to (a) establish a job placement system for&#13;
interprovincial labor mobility and (b) provide provincial and county Labor Bureau staff&#13;
with management training. A separate consultative body would be established consisting&#13;
of representatives of ACWF, the Public Security Bureau, the Ministry of Communications&#13;
and the Ministry of Industry. The formation of the new entity would minimize the effects&#13;
of bureaucratic tendencies and avoid high fees and ineffective monitoring systems in the&#13;
existing system. The joint entity's activities would be managed in a businesslike manner,&#13;
monitoring the responses of enterprises to training reimbursement and other incentives and&#13;
developing a plan for long-term financial self-sufficiency. It would be more responsive&#13;
to the needs of women and ethnic minorities, developing effective safeguards to minimize&#13;
special risks faced by these groups. Training and specialized technical assistance needs for&#13;
the joint entity and county labor bureaus would be included in the overall project training&#13;
and technical assistance programs. It would also build links to existing labor mobility&#13;
research institutions and, based on project experiences, offer policy recommendations.&#13;
4.6       Provincial Level. PLGs have been established in each of the three project&#13;
provinces. PLGs are headed by a vice governor in charge of poverty reduction and&#13;
assisted by representatives from the provincial PADO, Planning Commission and Finance&#13;
Bureau, the several technical Bureaus directly involved in the project (including the&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry, Health, Education, Labor and Statistical Bureaus), ACWF, and the&#13;
Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC). The main responsibilities of the PLGs&#13;
are to formulate project-related policies and plans, approve subproject designs, and&#13;
mobilize institutional, technical and financial resources and support for the implementation&#13;
of the project. PLGs would also provide a critical coordination and monitoring function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
4.7       Similar to WBPO at the central level, PMOs have been set up at the provincial&#13;
level. In close association with provincial PADOs, provincial PMOs serve as the&#13;
secretariat for PLGs and would manage the implementation of the project in their&#13;
corresponding provinces. PMOs would (a) review and approve feasibility studies prepared&#13;
by the project counties, (b) draw up annual work programs and budgets, (c) review and&#13;
approve lower-level PMO work plans, (d) approve disbursement of Bank Group and&#13;
govemment funds to local govemment accounts, (e) arrange the preparation and submit to&#13;
the central project office detailed project accounts, audits, withdrawal applications and&#13;
progress reports, (f) arrange common procurement, and (g) undertake project monitoring&#13;
of physical and financial progress and evaluations of project impact. Provincial PMOs&#13;
would also directly implement the provincial part of the institutional-development&#13;
component (para 3.36) and coordinate the research program of the land and farmer&#13;
development component (para 3.29). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
provincial PMOs would (a) be staffed at levels, and maintained with functions and&#13;
responsibilities, acceptable to the Bank Group, and (b) prepare and furnish a detailed&#13;
annual budget and work plan, including training, acceptable to the Bank Group, by&#13;
December 1 of each year, for project implementation the following year.&#13;
4.8      In order to take full advantage of the Ministry of Labor's existing information&#13;
network and nationwide hierarchy of Labor Bureaus, the provincial Labor Bureaus, in&#13;
conjunction with PMOs, would continue to play a leading role in the final preparation and&#13;
the implementation of the labor mobility component. Similarly, the provincial Health and&#13;
Educational Bureaus would also take a leading role in the preparation and implementation&#13;
of the social services component in order to secure reasonable consistency among the&#13;
counties and to improve the overall quality of implementation. For the project's other&#13;
components, the chain of command would directly link the provincial PMOs with county&#13;
level organizations (instead of going through provincial bureaus) in order to ensure&#13;
adequate coordination at the county-level and below. Support from all provincial agencies&#13;
(including the Labor, Health, and Education Bureaus) would be secured through the&#13;
function of the provincial PLGs. To provide technical support to provincial PLGs and&#13;
PMOs, TAGs comprising experts and senior consultants in various fields have also been&#13;
set up at the provincial level.&#13;
4.9       County Level and Below. PLGs have also been established at both the county&#13;
and township levels in order to fully mobilize existing institutional resources and guarantee&#13;
coordination among various agencies and units. Chaired by the county magistrate, the&#13;
county PLGs would take full responsibility for project implementation in their respective&#13;
county. County PMOs, chaired by deputy county magistrates responsible for poverty&#13;
reduction, have also been set up. The county PMOs function as the secretariat for the&#13;
county PLGs, and serve as the contact with project organizations at higher levels. The&#13;
county PMOs would also be responsible for project monitoring and evaluation, financial&#13;
management, arrangement of common procurement and distribution of goods and services&#13;
procured, and common training components in conjunction with line agencies at the county&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
4.10      County technical bureaus directly involved in the project would, in close&#13;
cooperation with Township Project Work Stations (TPWS) and Village Project Execution&#13;
Groups, be responsible for the day-to-day execution of the project in their corresponding&#13;
area. Under the leadership of the county PLG and PMO, the Health and Education&#13;
Bureaus would be responsible for the social services component; the Labor Bureaus for the&#13;
labor mobility component; the Agriculture, Water Resources, Forestry Bureaus and other&#13;
relevant bureaus for the land and farmers development component; and the Power,&#13;
Transportation, and Industry and Commerce Administration Bureaus for the rural&#13;
infrastructure component. Execution of the TVE development component would be the&#13;
responsibility of the county TVE Bureau and several other bureaus with responsibility for&#13;
rural industry. Responsibilities of these implementing agencies include planning, financial&#13;
management, procurement, disbursement, quality control, monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
encouraging farmers to participate in the project. Local nongovernmental organizations,&#13;
such as ACWF, would also be involved in the implementation of the project in activities&#13;
such as farmers' training and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
4.11      Various economic entities would be engaged in the implementation of the&#13;
project. In addition to individual project farm households, joint household entities with&#13;
various forms of ownership would be engaged in more commercially oriented agriculture&#13;
and forestry activities, e.g., fruit production. Joint ventures, between farmers and local&#13;
businesses, would also engage in commercially oriented production. For project activities&#13;
in mining, manufacturing, processing and service industries, TVEs with various forms of&#13;
ownership would play a dominant role. In addition, local employment agencies would be&#13;
engaged in the labor mobility activities.&#13;
4.12      Guangxi Municipal Employment Development Subcomponent.  The&#13;
organizational arrangement for implementation of the Guangxi municipal employment&#13;
development subcomponent would be the same as that for the rest of the project at the&#13;
central and provincial levels. At the municipal level, the standard PLG and PMO have&#13;
been set up in Beihai, Nanning and Fangcheng. In Beihai, where the proposed subprojects&#13;
would support a poverty reduction experimental program, the Rural Reform Experimental&#13;
Area Office would also play a key role in project management. Execution of the&#13;
subprojects would be carried out by various bureaus and enterprises of the three&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.13      Flow of Funds. MOF would onlend (a) the proceeds of the IDA credit to the&#13;
central PADO and the governments of the three project provinces, and (b) the IBRD loan&#13;
directly to Guangxi. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) MOF would onlend&#13;
the proceeds of the IDA credit to the governments of the three project provinces at&#13;
2 percent interest rate a year with a repayment period of 20 years, including a 6-year&#13;
grace period, (b) MOF would onlend the IBRD loan at the IBRD rate directly to Guangxi&#13;
Province, and (c) the foreign exchange risk would be borne by the provincial governments&#13;
and central PADO (for the interprovincial labor mobility component to be implemented&#13;
directly by WBPO). MOF would also manage both Special Accounts. A portion of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Bank Group funds onlent to the provinces would be used directly by the provinces to cover&#13;
the costs of institutional development, research, technical assistance, training, equipment,&#13;
management expenses and labor mobility activities. The provincial Finance Departments,&#13;
representing the provincial governments, would channel the remaining funds successively&#13;
to prefecture, municipal, county and township governments through their internal financial&#13;
system. Onlending to farmers and enterprises would be only for activities that have been&#13;
appraised and approved by the project implementing agencies. An assurance was obtained&#13;
at negotiations that onlending to TVEs and project enterprises in Beihai, Fangcheng and&#13;
Nanning (excluding enterprises responsible for labor mobility actvities) would be at&#13;
interest rates no less than the prevailing rate on ADBC loans for similar purposes.&#13;
C. ExECUTION OF PROJECT WORKS&#13;
4.14      Construction of minor works would be undertaken by participating poor&#13;
farmers or contracted out to construction enterprises depending on the component and local&#13;
circumstances. Land development and crop establishment would also be carried out by the&#13;
farmers participating in the project. Work teams from participating villages would be&#13;
organized to carry out labor-intensive works such as terracing and some road construction.&#13;
Larger works, such as large structures for irrigation systems and rural infrastructure and&#13;
larger buildings, would be contracted to construction companies. For the labor mobility&#13;
component, employment agencies of various kinds would carry out activities such as&#13;
collection of employment information, market promotion, and training and placement of&#13;
the laborers. Provision of initial training and monitoring of the employment conditions&#13;
would be the responsibilities of WBPO, provincial and county PMOs and Labor Bureaus,&#13;
and ACWF at various levels. The institutional development component and the centralized&#13;
taining and TA activities would be carried out by the WBPO and the provincial PMOs.&#13;
4.15      Prior to implementation, the provincial PMOs would further evaluate all the&#13;
county-level project feasibility studies (including representative designs for various types&#13;
of subprojects) to ensure that they are consistent with overall project objectives (para 3.40).&#13;
Criteria agreed during appraisal would be followed in the evaluation. Provincial line&#13;
agencies and TAGs would be mobilized to provide technical inputs in the reviewing&#13;
process. WBPO would (a) provide overall guidance and undertake a final quality check&#13;
as part of the evaluation and (b) present a summary of the outcome of the review process&#13;
to the Bank Group before September 1995. Detailed planning and design of subprojects&#13;
would be carried out by the respective implementing agencies and qualified design&#13;
institutes at various levels and reviewed according to domestic procedures. The provincial&#13;
PMOs should review at least two designs for each subproject in each project county.&#13;
Annual work programs and budget would be prepared based on the detailed designs and&#13;
sent to the Bank for review before December 1 of each year. To achieve the necessary&#13;
flexibility in project design and implementation, an assurance was obtained at negotiations&#13;
that WBPO and provincial PMOs would undertake a mid-term review of the project jointly&#13;
with the Bank Group by June 30, 1997.&#13;

4.16      To organize and initiate project implementation, the Bank Group and WBPO&#13;
would conduct a Project Launch Workshop in China for staff of provincial and county&#13;
PMOs. The purpose of the workshop would be to review the total program for&#13;
implementation and to clarify tasks and responsibilities at each level. Topics would include&#13;
Bank Group guidelines and procedures for procurement and disbursement, financial&#13;
management, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and computerized project planning&#13;
and management.&#13;
E. MONITORING, EVALUATON, AND REPoRTING&#13;
4.17      WBPO and provincial, municipal and county PMOs would monitor the&#13;
project's overall progress and impact, and evaluate the economic and financial benefits&#13;
from each component. Current accounts of physical and financial process for each&#13;
component would be kept to allow comparisons with management projections. The&#13;
project's impact on the incomes and physical well-being of project farmers would be&#13;
systematically monitored under the project's poverty monitoring component. Special&#13;
attention would be given to the effects of project activities on women and ethnic minorities.&#13;
A vision of what a project community would look like after project completion, a list of&#13;
key monitoring indicators for physical progress and project expenditures, and a plan for&#13;
Bank supervision are given in Annex 13. Information would be submitted by county&#13;
PMOs to provincial PMOs, then to WBPO, which would prepare consolidated semiannual&#13;
progress reports for submission to the Bank Group. In addition to routine reporting,&#13;
WBPO and PMOs would undertake on-site supervision at least twice a year.&#13;
Interprovincial and intercounty supervision would also be carried out periodically.&#13;
Findings of this on-site supervision, including problems identified and corrective actions&#13;
required, would be presented in the semiannual progress reports. Project completion&#13;
reports would be prepared for each component as they are completed. WBPO would&#13;
prepare, and submit to the Bank Group no later than three months following the closing&#13;
date, a final implementation completion report for the whole project based on the county,&#13;
municipal and provincial completion reports.&#13;

5. PRODUCTION AND MARKETS&#13;
A. PRODUCION&#13;
5.1      Incremental production under the project (Table 5.1) would derive from&#13;
(a) improved land use management by introducing more sustainable cultivation and&#13;
conservation technologies in the uplands; (b) increased crop yields by providing quality&#13;
seeds and other inputs, and integrated land improvement with supplementary irrigation and&#13;
drainage; (c) expansion of tree crop production areas, through reclamation of unused or&#13;
underutilized lands; (d) increased livestock production through improved management and&#13;
support of smalUholder animal husbandry; (e) improved access to agricultural extension and&#13;
input supply systems; and (f) increased availability of financial resources and improved&#13;
technologies for township and village enterprises.&#13;
5.2       Food and Cash Crops. The project would significantly increase yields and&#13;
output of grain, fodder and cash crops. Terracing, improvement of low-yield fields, and&#13;
extension programs would be the main factors contributing to the expected yield increases&#13;
of 38 percent for corn, 46 percent for potato, and 107 percent for fodder. Even greater&#13;
corn yield increases could be achieved through the extension of modern inputs, particularly&#13;
hybrid seeds and plastic sheeting, but this would entail much greater production costs and&#13;
risks for poor upland farmers. Therefore, improved conventional varieties with much&#13;
lower input costs would be encouraged during the initial years of the project. At full&#13;
development, production would increase by 122,710 tons of corn, 120,000 tons of sweet&#13;
potatoes and cassava, and about 10,000 tons of paddy and winter grains. The area planted&#13;
to paddy would increase slightly, while that of corn and tubers would decrease as they&#13;
would be gradually replaced by new mulberry trees and other cash crops. In addition, the&#13;
project would support the development of 10,124 ha of annual cash crops, resulting in&#13;
incremental output at full development of about 15,818 tons of medicinal herbs, 113,765&#13;
tons of sugarcane, and 19,434 tons of vegetables and other cash crops.&#13;
5.3       Tree Crops and Forestry. Most project households would take part in the&#13;
development of a wide variety of tree and bush crops on about 87,000 ha of sloped terrain.&#13;
The introduction of high-quality seedlings, balanced fertilizer applications, supplementary&#13;
irrigation, and improved harvesting practices under the project would greatly increase&#13;
yields of marketable fruit. At full development, annual incremental production would&#13;
include about 16,000 tons of longan, 60,400 tons of walnuts, chestnuts and gingko,&#13;
45,000 tons of oranges and pomelo, 22,000 tons of apples, 2,400 tons of tea, and 237,400&#13;
and 78,000 cubic meters of timber and fuelwood.&#13;
5.4       Animal Husbandry. The project would support smallholder activities in&#13;
breeding or fattening of an incremental 88,000 cattle, 226,000 goats, and 100,000 pigs to&#13;
&#13;

provide organic fertilizer for crops and income generation for about 186,650 households.&#13;
About 70 percent of required animal feed would be produced on-farm from local trees, a&#13;
wide range of both local and introduced forage species, and more efficient use of corn stalk&#13;
(para. 3.27). Using improved breeds and feeds, and improved smallholder management&#13;
techniques, the incremental production of beef, pork and mutton would reach about&#13;
29,300, 11,048 and 5,700 tons, respectively. In addition, the project would support&#13;
production of several local breeds of chicken and household beekeeping.&#13;
5.5       Sericulture and Aquaculture.  The project would assist about 76,000&#13;
households to plant mulberry on 5,100 ha. At full development, mulberry production&#13;
would be sufficient to produce about 8,140 tons of fresh silk cocoons. The project would&#13;
also improve silk cocoon quality by improving household-level management, collection and&#13;
drying facilities, and supporting sericulture training for technicians and farmers. About&#13;
267 ha of fishponds would also be developed in the project counties. At full development,&#13;
total fish production would be over 1,000 tons per year.&#13;
5.6       Township and Village Enterprises. Under the project, 15 fruit processing&#13;
plants would produce about 18,000 tons per year of juice and dried, frozen and canned&#13;
fruit. Cold storage facilities with an annual capacity of 5,000 tons of fruit would be&#13;
constructed under the project. TVEs would also process or produce 4,300 tons of tea,&#13;
2,200 tons of sugar, 50,000 pieces of leather, about 18,000 cubic meters of forest products&#13;
and 600 tons of raw silk per year. In addition, there would be 26 plants for marble,&#13;
granite, and other construction materials for local sale. Up to 76 farmers' markets would&#13;
be built to provide market access to farmers in the project areas.&#13;
B.   NxR&#13;
5.7       The project area is chronically deficient in the production and availability of&#13;
most basic food crops and products, including grain, vegetable oil, and meat, critically&#13;
depends on continued government supplies of relief grain (para. 2.10). Previous policies&#13;
have emphasized food self-sufficiency, but have largely failed to achieve the desired effect&#13;
in poor upland counties where farmers attempt to produce grain on unsuitably steep and&#13;
rocky land. Most project incremental grain, vegetable oil and meat output would therefore&#13;
be consumed on the farm or sold to local markets. The market prospects for tree crops&#13;
and other cash crops under the project are also favorable since (a) fruit and nuts have very&#13;
high income elasticities of demand, (b) locational shifts in orchard crops and mulberry&#13;
favor production in the project areas since urbanization and industrialization continue to&#13;
increase factor prices for production in coastal areas, (c) the unusual geographical&#13;
conditions of the project area make it possible to exploit a number of seasonal niches, and&#13;
(d) total incremental production of each crop would account for a fraction of total&#13;
provincial production since the project is producing a large range of crops across a widely&#13;
dispersed geographic area. Consequently, local demand within the project area and south&#13;
China is expected to absorb all of the grain, fodder, timber, and aquaculture production&#13;
and most of the orchard, livestock, and sericulture production. A small balance would be&#13;
exported to other parts of China or nearby foreign markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
5.8       During the past decade, government reforms have strongly emphasized&#13;
liberalization of marketing channels. As a result, nearly all agricultural commodities&#13;
produced under the project are now largely deregulated and, at least in part, traded through&#13;
the free-market system. Project farmers would be able to sell their products to (a) vendors&#13;
and households at local farmers' markets, (b) private traders, (c) agents from government&#13;
marketing enterprises, and (d) local agroprocessing industries.&#13;
5.9       Silk. China produced 660,000 tons of silk cocoon in 1992, and is moving&#13;
from heavy reliance on raw silk exports to processed goods that capture additional value&#13;
added from domestic manufacturing. At present, the three provinces account for less than&#13;
5 percent of China's total cocoon production, but their significant comparative advantage&#13;
in land and labor are consistent with an increased market share. Project incremental&#13;
production, which would amount to less than 10 percent of total current production in the&#13;
three provinces, would be sold primarily to the prefectural and county-level branch offices&#13;
of the China National Silk Import and Export Corporation (CNSIEC). CNSIEC fully&#13;
controls China's silk exports and pricing.&#13;
5.10      TVE Outputs. All agroprocessing feasibility studies would include a review&#13;
of commercial viability, and it is expected that incremental production would be absorbed&#13;
without difficulties through existing domestic and export markets. Given the high income&#13;
elasticity of demand for processed fruit, vegetables and meat, expected growth in per&#13;
capita income would lead to increased sales of processed goods from local TVEs. While&#13;
most TVE production will meet local demand, small amounts of fruit, silk and medicinal&#13;
herbs would be exported through existing channels. Construction materials would be&#13;
largely absorbed by high local demand from the booming construction industry.&#13;
C. PRICES&#13;
5.11      China's agricultural price reforms over the past decade have freed many&#13;
agricultural commodities from state control and increased the procurement prices of those&#13;
goods still subject to state marketing channels. In 1993, only 10 to 15 percent of the retail&#13;
value of agricultural commodities was reportedly traded at official state prices. Similarly,&#13;
in the project area, most agricultural commodity prices reflect market supply and demand,&#13;
and are broadly consistent with world market prices. Immediately after the harvest season,&#13;
for example, the free-market price of corn in the project area is about Y 0.95/kg, or about&#13;
10 percent greater than world prices. Silk prices, which are controlled by CNSIEC, are&#13;
an exception. However, CNSIEC's current pricing structure provides strong incentive for&#13;
mulberry and silkworm production in the project area.&#13;

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1       The project would improve the income levels and physical well-being of about&#13;
2.8 million absolute poor inhabitants of southwest China. The main project benefits would&#13;
be (a) increased income levels by improving upland agricultural productivity through a&#13;
participatory approach, (b) better access to off-farm employment opportunities through the&#13;
development of TVEs and labor mobility, (c) improved access to social and other basic&#13;
services by increasing access to markets, safe drinking water, electric power, education,&#13;
health and other social services, (d) stabilization and reversal of upland environmental&#13;
destruction through land improvement and natural resource conservation works, and (e)&#13;
improved (i) poverty project design and implementation capacity and (ii) poverty&#13;
monitoring at the project and national levels.&#13;
6.2      Increased Income and Employment. The project would directly increase&#13;
beneficiary household incomes through (a) increasing production of grain, cash and tree&#13;
crops and livestock, and (b) providing greater opportunity for off-farm employment in local&#13;
TVEs and more distant job markets. Farm productivity increases would derive from the&#13;
combined effect of increased investment intensity, improved technology, and integrated&#13;
village development programs. Off-farm employment opportunities would be provided to&#13;
about 343,000 upland poor in rural enterprise within their counties (67,000 jobs), within&#13;
their provinces (162,000 jobs), and outside their provinces (114,000 jobs). These jobs&#13;
would provide annual net incomes per migrant of at least Y 355, Y 500, and Y 610&#13;
respectively. In combination with expected increases in on-farm family income, it is&#13;
estimated that average annual per capita income in the project areas would double to about&#13;
Y 690 (in constant 1992 yuan) at full development.&#13;
6.3      Improved Social and Other Basic Services. The planned investments in&#13;
social services would provide basic education, health and nutrition services. The project&#13;
would directly improve primary education for some 600,000 children in the project areas&#13;
(and indirectly benefit another 600,000 children outside project areas who would use&#13;
township school facilities upgraded by the project). Measures including tuition assistance&#13;
and in-school nutrition intervention would enable about 220,000 absolutely poor children&#13;
to enroll in schools and complete their primary education. Similarly, village health care&#13;
funds would greatly augment the delivery of basic health services to project area children&#13;
and adults. It is expected that infant mortality rates would be reduced from more than 10&#13;
percent at present to less than 4 percent at full development, and maternal mortality would&#13;
be reduced by more than 50 percent. The incidence of endemic diseases, such as iodine&#13;
deficiency and fluoridosis, would also be reduced by more than 50 percent. Gravel roads&#13;
would link 565 project villages to the existing network of county roads. In addition to&#13;
providing job opportunities to the local inhabitants, the construction of these rural roads&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
would provide isolated villages much improved access to markets, which will induce higher&#13;
levels of agricultural production and marketing. Provision of safe drinking water to some&#13;
663,000 project beneficiaries would reduce the incidence of diarrheal and other water-&#13;
related diseases, and would reduce the time and labor women are required to spend&#13;
supplying water for their families and livestock.&#13;
6.4       Enhanced Beneficiary and Community Participation. From the outset of&#13;
preparation, the project adopted a participatory strategy in which upland farmers helped&#13;
design a menu of options to address their development needs. By emphasizing integrated&#13;
village development, the project would aim at demonstrating and strengthening the capacity&#13;
of village organizations to manage their own resources. The integrated village production&#13;
system, once established, should become a key factor in sustaining the land and farmer&#13;
development. Particular attention has also been given to ensuring that ethnic minorities&#13;
and women are actively involved in the project and derive positive benefits.&#13;
6.5       Environ mental Protection. The project would have a positive effect on the&#13;
environment through subproject investments in land-terracing works, water storage,&#13;
agroforestry, and on-farm soil conservation works. Most importantly, project households&#13;
would take part in planting and maintenance of tree and bush species on more than 87,000&#13;
ha of steeply sloped hillsides and wastelands. Tree and bush species would better protect&#13;
the remaining soil on these fragile hills, and would provide greater financial retums over&#13;
the medium and longer term.  Together, these investments would reverse further&#13;
degradation of the fragile ecosystem, restore natural vegetative cover, reduce runoff and&#13;
soil loss, and improve soil fertility.&#13;
B. CosT AND RENT RECOVERY&#13;
6.6       Cost recovery for the land and farmer development component would involve&#13;
several elements. The cost of chemical fertilizer, agrochemicals, feed concentrates and&#13;
other agricultural and livestock inputs would be recovered by repayments from&#13;
beneficiaries. Some of the costs of research and training would be recovered either by fees&#13;
levied directly on beneficiaries or through taxes paid on project production. Services&#13;
provided by veterinary and other agricultural services support staff would be recovered&#13;
through service fees. The costs for the labor mobility component would be recovered&#13;
through wage deductibles paid by those laborers successfully placed under the project. The&#13;
cost recovery analysis of the representative village programs shows that, at present tax&#13;
rates, project charges would be sufficient to cover project costs with a recovery index of&#13;
102 percent. Rent recovery averages 45 percent at full development and 72 percent&#13;
discounted over the life of the project (Annex 12 .&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.7       Financial and economic analysis for the project was carried out based on&#13;
analysis of representative village programs (including labor mobility activities) and selected&#13;
representative TVE subprojects. The village programs are representive of the project&#13;
area's two major types of geographical and climatical conditions, viz., the karst range&#13;
region and the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau. Financial and economic rates of return were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
estimated for the village programs and for individual project activities under the programs.&#13;
Farm model analysis was also carried out to assess the financial impact of the programs&#13;
on the farm households. The selected TVE investments include silk reeling, fruit&#13;
processing subprojects and manufacturing subprojects based on local mineral deposits. All&#13;
of the subprojects are labor intensive, reflecting the project's strong employment emphasis.&#13;
6.8       Flnancial Analysis. The analysis indicates that financial rates of return (FRR)&#13;
for the village programs are in the range of about 40 percent, with FRRs for various&#13;
activities ranging from 11 to 72 percent (Annex 12). The high financial returns of the&#13;
programs would provide adequate incentives for farmers to adopt the strategies proposed&#13;
by the project. Farm model analysis for the programs illustrates that with an average&#13;
investment of Y 589 per person (Y 446 excluding labor mobility), farmers' per capita&#13;
annual grain production would increase from approximately 215 kg at present to 300 kg&#13;
at full development. During the same period, it is expected that farmers' annual per capita&#13;
net income would double from approximately Y 370 to Y 770 in real terms (i.e., greatly&#13;
exceeding the per capita income target established by the 8-7 Plan). The farm model&#13;
analysis also illustrates that even in the early years of the project, net cash income&#13;
generated by the labor mobility, livestock and cash crop activities would be more than&#13;
enough to meet cash requirements of intensified grain production. In contrast to many&#13;
previous poverty reduction programs in southwest China, this project's village program&#13;
would be financially sustainable.&#13;
6.9       The financial analysis indicates that the FRR for the labor mobility component&#13;
is about 70 percent, even after assuming a full year postponement of the revenue stream,&#13;
very conservative estimates of the job retention rate (viz., 60 percent by the fourth year&#13;
of employment), and very generous living expenses (60 percent of the total wage income).&#13;
The strong FRR is consistent with the extreme wage rate differentials between poor rural&#13;
areas and more prosperous urban and rural areas (para 2.33), and strongly confirms project&#13;
support for labor mobility. For the TVE component, the FRRs range between 19 percent&#13;
to 21 percent. The relatively high returns would be more than adequate to meet interest&#13;
and loan repayment obligations and guarantee attractive rates of return to equity investors.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis shows that all FRRs are relatively robust to wide changes in input and&#13;
output prices (Annex 12).&#13;
6.10      Economic Analysis. Economic farm gate prices are calculated for tradable&#13;
commodities and inputs using border prices as reported in the Bank Group's commodity&#13;
price forecasts, adjusted for transportation and marketing margins. For nontradable items,&#13;
financial farm gate prices were assumed to represent economic prices where markets are&#13;
not regulated. The shadow wage rate for unskilled labor has been estimated at Y 4 per&#13;
day, reflecting high unemployment in the project area. Investment costs are expressed in&#13;
economic values through the application of conversion factors. AU economic values are&#13;
converted to local currency at the official exchange rate of Y 8.7. A project life of 20&#13;
years is assumed.&#13;
6.11      The project-wide economic analysis excludes the education, health, rural&#13;
infrastructure, institution building and poverty monitoring subcomponents and components&#13;
because it is impractical to quantify their benefits. However, these activities are essential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
to the long term success and sustainability of the project and no doubt have very high&#13;
economic and social returns. Estimated ERRs for the projects's other activities are about&#13;
40 percent for the village programs, 86 percent for the labor mobility component, and 32&#13;
to 45 percent for the subprojects under the TVE development component. For the project&#13;
as a whole, the ERR is estimated at 36 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the&#13;
ERRs are relatively robust to wide changes in input and output prices (Annex 12, Table&#13;
11).&#13;
D. RISKS&#13;
6.12      The project addresses problems of chronic absolute poverty and natural&#13;
resource degradation in an area where previous single-sector interventions have not led to&#13;
sustainable reductions in poverty. The greatest strength of the project-its focussed&#13;
multisectoral rural development approach-comes at the inherent cost of greater than&#13;
average complexity and greater difficulties in implementation. This risk was acknowledged&#13;
prior to the outset of project preparation (para 1.19), and has been effectively countered&#13;
by (a) the project's unique organizational and management structure (para 1.20), (b) a&#13;
strong institution and implementation capacity building program (para 3.36), and (c) the&#13;
full involvement of the beneficiaries and village communities in the design and&#13;
implementation of the project (para 6.4). In addition, the project relies on an integrated&#13;
package of proven technologies and interventions. County level governments, where&#13;
leadership required for effective implementation is more sustainable due to the local&#13;
importance of the project, have extensive experience with these technologies and&#13;
interventions. Although the project would still be of above-average complexity, this risk&#13;
is acceptable since the project's design is so closely linked to the 8-7 Plan.&#13;
6.13      The individual project components also have specific associated risks. For the&#13;
land and farmer development component, there is a risk of slower than expected adoption&#13;
of improved farming practices, resulting in slower realization of economic and&#13;
environmental benefits. However, the improved techniques would (a) be integrated with&#13;
existing local farming practices, (b) require limited material inputs, and (c) be introduced,&#13;
in some cases, on a pilot basis. The project's emphasis on strengthening the extension&#13;
service through technical assistance and provision of required subject-matter specialists,&#13;
and training of farmer-technicians and demonstration households is also designed to&#13;
minimize these risks (para 3.29).&#13;
6.14      The labor mobility and TVE components face three risks: (a) institutional&#13;
coordination demands, (b) sudden changes in market conditions, and (c) weak monitoring&#13;
of worker conditions. To assist the joint entity formed by LGPR and MOL, a consultative&#13;
body would be established, involving the ACWF, the Public Security Bureau and the&#13;
Ministries of Construction and Industry, to address these risks. A pilot phase evaluation&#13;
would also identify operational issues such as remittance channels and worker treatment,&#13;
and make necessary adjustments (Annex 4, paras. 66-71). The diversified portfolio of&#13;
small scale TVEs has been developed with attention to commercial viability. While&#13;
specific TVEs face higher demand and price fluctuations (notably silk reeling), the majority&#13;
of products are intended for use in growing local and provincial markets.&#13;

Education Subcomponent&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The development of human capital through improving the delivery of primary&#13;
education is a vital ingredient for effective poverty reduction in China. High enrollment&#13;
and completion rates in primary education are clearly associated with increases in&#13;
productivity, income and growth in developing countries. Many studies show that&#13;
education (plus experience) is one of the most important statistical determinants of workers'&#13;
rewards in the labor market. Furthermore, there is a synergistic interaction between&#13;
investments in basic education and improvements in other important correlates of poverty.&#13;
Enhanced education leads to improved health. The education of girls is particularly&#13;
important because the more educated a woman, the lower her fertility. Female education&#13;
also results in higher child survival rates. The more educated the parents, particularly the&#13;
mother, the lower is maternal mortality and the healthier is the child. In addition, the&#13;
enhanced provision of basic education results in greater adoption rates of new agricultural&#13;
technology.&#13;
2.    Overall, China has made tremendous progress in enhancing the educational status of&#13;
its population. However, progress has been uneven and there are significant areas of China&#13;
where educational attainment is very low. This project, by supporting well-targeted&#13;
investments in primary education, is assisting the Government in its integrated approach to&#13;
reduce poverty. This subcomponent would enhance the provision of primary education to&#13;
the poor in project areas through: primary school renovation and construction; supporting&#13;
tuition assistance and in-school nutritional supplements for poor students; the provision of&#13;
textbooks, instructional equipment and furniture, and teacher and management training. By&#13;
the end of the project, primary school enrollment and completion rates would increase by&#13;
10 - 20 percent.&#13;
Sector Background&#13;
3.    Compared with other developing countries, China's success in providing a&#13;
comprehensive schooling system to its population has been remarkable. Enrollment rates in&#13;
the first nine years of schooling are higher than in most other lower income countries with&#13;
more than 95 percent of the 6 - 11 age cohort enrolled in primary school and over 60&#13;
percent of the 12-15 age cohort in lower secondary school. As a result, literacy rates are&#13;
higher than in most countries with similar levels of economic development. On a national&#13;
level, it is estimated that the literacy rate for those 15 years of age and older is over 80&#13;
percent and is close to 93 percent among the 15 to 25 year age group. However, these&#13;
impressive national level statistics conceal severe regional inequities in educational&#13;
attainment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                                    Annex 2&#13;
4.     In 1986, China passed a "Compulsory Education Law" to mandate universal basic&#13;
education. 12 Under this law, local governments were given education finance&#13;
responsibilities to manage their budgets and were encouraged to use local resources more&#13;
efficiently. Consequently, at the national level, while the share of total education&#13;
expenditure to total expenditure has remained roughly the same during the past decade, the&#13;
share of the non-center contribution to education has increased and the level of&#13;
contributions from the center has declined (Figure 1). While the goal of compulsory&#13;
education in most large cities and coastal areas has been achieved, due to severe poverty&#13;
and thus low levels of local govermment and private resources in rural areas, the educational&#13;
status of poor children has remained deplorable. Therefore, in the project areas poverty has&#13;
diminished sources for education finance and reinforced a vicious cycle: poverty results in&#13;
illiteracy which, in tum, reduces access of the poor to better income eaming opportunities.&#13;

Education Issues Within Project Provinces&#13;
5.     Due to insufficient access and inadequate quality, the project areas experience low&#13;
enrollment and completion rates with educational attainment almost always worse among&#13;
minorities and females. The average net enrollment rate (NER) in project townships is&#13;
Universal education refers to six years of primary education plus three years of junior secondary education.&#13;
2 The State Education Commission (SEdC) recently announced its plan to implement the universal basic education&#13;
program by year 2000. The phased program would enable 85% of the school age population to complete primary&#13;
school and enroll in junior middle school. The remaining 15% of the people- living in poverty-stricken areas with poor&#13;
education facilities - will have a lower education target: three to six years in primary school.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

about ten percent below the provincial average. (Table 1.1) 3  Because township averages&#13;
include at least one third of better-off villages outside project areas, they overestimate the&#13;
enrollment rate of school children in project areas. In addition, school enrollment rate&#13;
estimates tend to include everyone on the first day of class even though they might not&#13;
return. This practice consistently overestimates the number of poor and minorities&#13;
attending school. Of the 600 poorest households (where 78 percent are minorities) in our&#13;
project areas, the average enrollment rate is 55 percent (65 percent among boys and 45&#13;
percent among girls).&#13;
6.    Along with low enrollment, the project areas experience low completion rates.&#13;
Completion rates in provinces where the project is occurring are about 10 percent below the&#13;
national average (except for Guangxi) (Table 1.1). Among the poorest project townships,&#13;
more than one half of the children who enrolled in primary school had failed to finish the&#13;
primary cycle. These numbers tend to overestimate the completion rate due to the&#13;
inclusion of non-project villages. Furthermore, SSB survey data indicates that in the poorest&#13;
project areas about 39 percent of the 7-15 age cohort have never enrolled in primary&#13;
school; of these children about 60 percent are girls. This same source of data demonstrates&#13;
that among the 13-15 age cohort, only 20 percent of the boys and 5 percent of the girls&#13;
graduated from primary school.&#13;
7.    Low completion rates underscore high repetition and dropout rates among rural poor&#13;
particularly among and girls and minorities. For example, a feasibility study for the project&#13;
in the province of Guishou suggests that 80 percent of school age dropouts in the project&#13;
area are girls. Although the lack of statistics on minorities makes it difficult to establish&#13;
more than an anecdotal case, SSB data indicates that upland minorities have lower school&#13;
enrollment and completion rates. Given the above, it is not surprising that in the project&#13;
areas approximately 35 percent of the population is illiterate. Seventy percent of which&#13;
reside in the poorest, remote or minority areas and 78 percent of which are women.&#13;
NER = (those in the age group who are in school / population of school age group)* I 00%.&#13;
4 Completion rate = the percentage of those who start school in Ist grade reach graduation.&#13;
Graduation rate in stead of the completion rate is used by SEdC as one of the indicators to measure the degree&#13;
of universalization of primary education. However, graduation rate only refer to percentage of children in 5th&#13;
grade who pass the graduation exams, and hence does not account for repetition and dropouts.&#13;

8.      Given the low  level of educational attainment in poor areas it is not surprising that&#13;
access to basic education is problematic. Poverty combined with annual school fees are a&#13;
major hinderance to basic education for those in the project areas. The average school fee&#13;
of approximately Y70 per child is often prohibitive for families with annual per capita&#13;
income less than Y300.5 Furthermore, there are often additional costs, such as boarding&#13;
and transportation for families to incur. In Guangxi, approximately 71 percent of school age&#13;
children do not enroll or drop out of primary school because parents cannot afford the&#13;
direct costs associated with school enrollment. In addition to school fees and expenses for&#13;
boarding and transportation, families also perceive an opportunity cost in the form of&#13;
foregone household labor of children who are in school. This issue is particularly relevant&#13;
as an obstacle to girls education where there is often a perceived irrelevance of primary&#13;
school curricula to women's employment possibilities.&#13;
B By the Education Law, no tuition can be collected at any public primary schools. However, schools charge&#13;
fees primarily for textbooks and to cover part of their operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                                    Annex 2&#13;
9.     Another issue hindering access of those in project areas to education is the&#13;
insufficient number and dilapidated condition of school facilities. Little money exists for&#13;
facility construction and renovation. The lack of complete schools (grades 1 - 6) and&#13;
teaching points at the village level often deter enrollment of children. Furthermore, in most&#13;
administrative villages, students attend shelterless schools or ones that are poorly&#13;
maintained and ill-equipped. Most of the schools were either built in the 1970s or&#13;
converted from grain storage and warehouses and have not been maintained or repaired. At&#13;
the township centers, complete primary schools (grades 1 to 6) often exist. However,&#13;
facilities in these areas are often inadequate and there is a perennial shortage of classrooms&#13;
and boarding space, and there are more than fifty students in classrooms built for half that&#13;
number. As a result, students often deter enrollment. In addition, low maintenance and&#13;
little renovation has resulted in the dilapidated conditions of existing township schools.&#13;
10.    Along with access issues, the delivery of basic primary education suffers from&#13;
inadequate teacher training. In Guizhou, due to the shortage of qualified teachers, about 51&#13;
percent of primary school teachers are hired as either locally supported (Minban6) or&#13;
substitute (Daike') teachers. Compared to regular (Gongban8.) teachers, Minban teachers&#13;
have lower pay scales and no retirement benefits; however, they usually enjoy a minimum&#13;
income of more than 100 yuan per month (about half of which is paid from county budget&#13;
and the rest by township funds), a significant cash income in poor areas. Starting from&#13;
early 1980s, local government stopped recruiting minban teachers. The number of Minban&#13;
teachers has decreased due to teacher attrition and upgrade to Gongban. Therefore,&#13;
substitute teachers account for increasing share of the non-gongban teachers. When salaries&#13;
are low, these teachers are likely to supplement their incomes by other pursuits, such as&#13;
working on their own lands or running small shops as sideline activities, a practice that&#13;
increases teachers' absenteeism and shorten effective teaching hours.&#13;
6 In our project areas, before June 1993, half of a Minban teacher's salary was paid by the county budget,&#13;
the other half was paid by township budget and collective levies. Since most poor townships were unable to&#13;
pay their teachers, counties have taken their full responsibilities in Minban teachers' salary payment since&#13;
June 1993.&#13;
' Due to local governments' inability to finance teachers salaries, "affordable" teachers are hired under&#13;
contracts to substitute regular teachers with half the salary, and perhaps less than half the experience and&#13;
training. These teachers are usually paid by village collective levies. Their salaries range from Y50-70&#13;
monthly.&#13;
S some minban teachers have changed their status to gongban after they pass qualify examinations since&#13;
early 1980s, and this has greatly encouraged minban teachers to pursuit professional improvement mostly on&#13;
their own initiatives.&#13;

11.   Most of these teachers are lower-secondary school graduates; and some did not even&#13;
graduate from primary school. Not only do they lack the background knowledge of subject&#13;
matter, but also the academic background to acquire adequate teaching skills. In addition,&#13;
teachers in minority areas often have inadequate training in bilingual education and thus&#13;
further discourage retention of the minority students.  Insufficient number of teachers and&#13;
low quality of teaching often reinforce the negative perceptions about the value of&#13;
education, and hence further reduce enrollment rate.&#13;

Subcomponent Project Description&#13;
12.  In the project areas, widespread poverty has diminished the pool of local government&#13;
resources available to provide basic education and the ability of parents to pay even the&#13;
modest of tuition. This combined with the perceived opportunity cost of sending children to&#13;
school has resulted in difficult access for the absolute poor, particularly minorities and girls,&#13;
and the low quality of those education services delivered.&#13;
13.   The education subcomponent would increase the access and quality of basic&#13;
education for school-aged children in project areas. This would occur through: (a)&#13;
upgrading school facilities, (b) providing tuition and boarding assistance and a seasonal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                                 Annex 2&#13;
school nutrition program, (c) eliciting community support through covenants in production&#13;
contracts under the project and promotion campaigns; (d) providing adequate textbooks and&#13;
instructional equipment; (e) training of teachers and education system managers; (f)&#13;
providing salaries for additional teachers; (g) adopting an affirmative action approach to&#13;
recruit female and minority teachers; and (h) institution building and technical assistance to&#13;
enhance ability of local education offices to implement the project. Education activities&#13;
would be integrated with other project initiatives, such as the agricultural development and&#13;
health components, to increase effectiveness, sustainability and local commitment to&#13;
universal education.&#13;
14.   Key indicators, including enrollment and completion rates - particularly those of&#13;
girls, and the rate of certified teachers, should reach county average at the end of the&#13;
project. Provincial education bureaus would assist county bureaus in the design and&#13;
implementation of the component. The component investment is about Y217 million over&#13;
five years, representing 7.8 percent of total project base costs. A distribution of project&#13;
investment would be school facility upgrading (49.7 percent), assistantships and the&#13;
nutrition program (28.6 percent), books and equipment (10 percent), teacher and&#13;
management training (8 percent), and project implementation and technical assistance (3.7&#13;
percent). The main features of each component are described below.&#13;
Facilities Upgrading (Base cost Y108 million)&#13;
15.   Additional Teaching Points. The lack of village primary education facilities make&#13;
teaching points a high investment priority. To increase primary school enrollment and&#13;
improve school attendance, particularly that of girls, building more teaching points or&#13;
completing those incomplete village schools is an effective response, provided that schools&#13;
are located within children's walking distance (within 2 km). About Y57.2 million (base&#13;
cost) would be used to rehabilitate or construct about 2,400 school points. Each teaching&#13;
point would accommodate at least 5 students up to grade 3.&#13;
16.   Upgrading Village Center Schools. About Y48.7 million would be used to finance&#13;
civil works such as renovation, rehabilitation, and urgently needed new construction of 320&#13;
center schools in administrative villages.9 About 40 percent of the funds would be used to&#13;
repair and renovate existing facilities and about 60 percent for construction of new&#13;
additional classrooms, student dormitories, sanitary facilities, and teachers' office and&#13;
dormitories.&#13;
9 A typical village center school often includes a two-story building with 6 to 8 classrooms, student and&#13;
teacher dormitories, sanitary facility, and a simply equipped area for physical education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                 Annex 2&#13;
Assistance to Students (base cost Y62.15 million)&#13;
17.   Tuition Assistance. One important lesson is that building more schools does not&#13;
guarantee higher enrollment and retention rates. To encourage perennially out-of-school&#13;
children to seek education is at least as important as increasing the supply of schools.&#13;
School fees often account for one quarter of the family's annual income. For these&#13;
children, reducing direct costs to education is an important step in increasing educational&#13;
attainment.&#13;
18.   About Y38.16 million (base cost) would be used for assisting students with fees and&#13;
textbooks. The main selection criteria for the recipients is that their annual family per&#13;
capita income or grain consumption is below the average in project areas. Those from&#13;
families disadvantaged by chronic illness, illiteracy, or natural disasters, or with disabled&#13;
family member(s), would be given priority. Girls would account for no less than 50&#13;
percent of those selected. The program would be phased out over six years'". It is&#13;
estimated that about 540,000 children/years would be waived for 60-100 percent of school&#13;
fees. During project implementation (including pilot projects in 1995), 5 percent, 30&#13;
percent, 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent of the target children would&#13;
enroll in the program. A transparent and effective implementation program would be&#13;
developed based on clearly defined criteria to ensure appropriate targeting.&#13;
19.   Community participation would play a central role. School teachers and natural&#13;
village leaders would coordinate in selecting recipients. The selection would be balanced&#13;
and checked by township education and project offices, and submitted to the county&#13;
education project office for approval. The final selection would be posted at local schools&#13;
and would be subject to evaluation by local villagers. The county education project office&#13;
would deliver the textbooks to schools based on the approved name-lists or reimburse&#13;
schools with fees when schools ensure the enrollment and retention of these children.&#13;
20.   In-School Supplementary Nutrition Program. Another important reason for the&#13;
deferred enrollment among children from absolute poor families was the lack of food&#13;
during the hunger season (March to May). An in-school supplementary nutrition program&#13;
to avert increased malnutrition during the interharvest would be cost-effective in alleviating&#13;
short-term hunger and its adverse effect on leaming for poor children. The selection&#13;
criteria and the detailed implementation plan would be similar to that for providing tuition&#13;
' It is expected that the implementation of the SWPRP would bring out increased family income and local&#13;
resource, thus local communities' ability to support basic education. A detailed phased program, including&#13;
support for basic education through taxes on incremental production under the project, would be worked out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-                               Annex 2&#13;
assistance. About Y21.5 million (base cost) would be used to finance the component and&#13;
benefit 205,000 children/years. Schools would be reimbursed for grains and relevant&#13;
expenses by county education project offices, and subject to supervision of village&#13;
communities.&#13;
21.   Boarding Facility. Approximately Y2.5 million would be used for administrative&#13;
village center schools to purchase beds, sheets, and cook-wares to accommodate 16,600&#13;
students per year from remote villages. Most of these students are of grades 4 - 6 and have&#13;
to come to village center school to complete their primary study (nearby teaching points&#13;
usually offer classes up to grade 3).&#13;
22.   Community Support. The above strategies of assisting students would be most&#13;
effective when combined with mobilizing community support. Sending children to school&#13;
should be a precondition for a household or a village community to participate in the&#13;
project. Furthermore, education promotion campaigns would help parents understand the&#13;
value of education and the greater benefits of sending their children to school. School&#13;
teachers would work with local leaders and women's federation to incorporate education&#13;
promotion into the adult "Illiteracy Elimination Campaign. When parents are active in the&#13;
educational process, it is more likely that their children will attend school. In remote rural&#13;
areas, community consensus often plays an important role. When taxes have to be&#13;
collected, voluntary labor has to be supplied, and other donations have to be made, it is&#13;
important to have support from whole community. At the same time, efforts should be&#13;
made to reduce the opportunity costs perceived by families. Strategies include establishing&#13;
preschools within the primary schools to increase girls attendance and to expose younger&#13;
children to the school environment; and instituting some communal labor-sharing&#13;
arrangement for grazing goats and cattle.&#13;
Books, Instructional Equipment and Furniture (Base cost Y20 million).&#13;
23.  In order to further decrease the direct costs of schooling, the project would equip&#13;
rural schools in project areas with books and equipment kits to Standard Three level.&#13;
About 900,000 books, 2,000 sets of instructional equipment (mainly for since education),&#13;
and about 200,000 sets of tables and chairs would be purchased under the project.&#13;
Teacher and Management Training (Base cost Y17.56 million)&#13;
24.   Adequately trained teachers and managers are vital to providing quality education.&#13;
Therefore, under the project, various programs will be offered to enhance the capabilities of&#13;
teachers and education managers. Nearly 18,200 person/times of in-province training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
provided to approximately 10,000 participants would be carried out through one-year and&#13;
short-term in-service courses. A limited number of study tours would be provided in areas&#13;
of girls and bilingual education. Priority will be given to selecting domestic locations&#13;
which are good examples in these areas.&#13;
25.   Teacher Qualification Training. This portion of the sub-component would include:&#13;
(a) full-time qualification training, (b) in-service qualification training through&#13;
correspondence education, and (c) brief periods of intensive subject-specific in-service&#13;
training (such as those on teaching skills of multi-grades and multi-subjects). The project&#13;
would provide training for 12,000 teachers/years for both full-time and part-time teachers.&#13;
Priority would be given to teachers who are post-secondary graduates".&#13;
26.   Bilingual Education Training. Under the project, 3,376 teachers/years from non-&#13;
sinicized minority villages will be trained in bilingual teaching methods. The project would&#13;
emphasize bilingual education targeting non-sinicized minority groups in project areas.&#13;
Language is the second hurdle (next to poverty) hindering non-sinicized minority children&#13;
in obtaining education. Many of them often fall behind the education program from the&#13;
first year; others manage to get through the elementary school system without ever&#13;
mastering Han Chinese. Bilingual education programs exist in three provinces (particularly&#13;
at provincial or county minority schools - minzhu xiaoxue- where only few can attend), but&#13;
fail to reach many children living in isolated mountainous villages. Discussions with&#13;
various education officials, along with local villagers, led to three general provisions to&#13;
primary education in non-sinicized minority areas. These include (a) the use of home&#13;
language as the medium of instruction at lower grades, (b) proficiency of Han Chinese&#13;
upon graduation, (c) teachers' training of bilingual teaching skills to achieve the above&#13;
goals.&#13;
27.   Programs of bilingual education in primary schools are trying to address not the&#13;
issue of ethnic histories or culture, but the necessity for effective primary education in&#13;
minority communities. In addition, mobility in society or simply broader economic&#13;
networks will require working in Han Chinese. It is commonly recognized among&#13;
educators that home language can serve best the medium of instruction at the beginning. In&#13;
providing bilingual education it is effective to use home language first and then switch to&#13;
Han Chinese later. Given the already significant amount of instruction time already&#13;
allocated to Han Chinese study (generally about 45 percent of the instruction time at rural&#13;
primary schools), some raise the concern that time further divided between two languages&#13;
may lower levels of achievement in either language. One effective measure found in these&#13;
areas is to establishing preschool within primary schools, not only to "baby-sit" young&#13;
" Teachers with less than post-secondary general education would spend most of the training time on&#13;
academic remediation. Therefore, it would be cost-effective to give training priority to teachers who are post-&#13;
secondary graduates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                              Annex 2&#13;
siblings for students, but to prepare young children with a new language and the learning&#13;
environment. Areas that are accomplishing the first goal are often failing in the second,&#13;
because they use local language for all purposes except reading texts aloud. Home&#13;
language, used as the medium of instruction, continues to be the "study aid" throughout the&#13;
primary cycle. Thus many young adult elementary school graduates are unable to express&#13;
themselves in Han Chinese or had already lost any useful knowledge of Han Chinese. To&#13;
avoid this issue, teachers in these areas must be trained in effective bilingual teaching&#13;
methods.&#13;
28.   Policy of Affirmative Action. The project would provide monies (Yl.4 million) to&#13;
hire an estimated 1,467 qualified teachers. In the long term, emphasis would be placed on&#13;
policies to encourage qualified teachers to work in isolated areas. In general, the sheer lack&#13;
of facilities in poor schools discourage teachers to relocate and remain in rural areas.&#13;
Incentive policies would include: (a) improving working and living conditions for teachers&#13;
at rural schools; (b) giving priority in teacher college recruitment to enroll candidates who&#13;
are from, and more likely to return to, absolute poor communities; and (c) providing&#13;
additional benefits to attract qualified female teachers, who can serve as role models for&#13;
young girls. Provincial Education Commissions (PECs) have committed to recruit more&#13;
students from poor areas and have initiated programs to encourage graduates, particularly&#13;
women, to work in remote rural areas. Therefore, the teacher training subcomponent would&#13;
be phased out during the project implementation, and incremental demand for teachers&#13;
would be supplemented gradually through PECs' formal recruitment and assignment of the&#13;
graduates.&#13;
29.   Management Training. In-service training would also be provided to 3,112&#13;
person/years of primary school principals and educational administrators in project areas.&#13;
The professional development of primary school management has been given a high priority&#13;
in the design of the component. These training include (a) short school-based generic&#13;
activities on a regular and recurrent basis, (b) regular retraining of principals in educffon&#13;
districts and at teachers centers and institutions for generic upgrading, or (c) training for&#13;
specific objectives, such as delivering bilingual education, assisting students through fees&#13;
waiving or in-school nutrition programs, (d) and regular, intensive upgrading of&#13;
administrators at county level for six-week blocks of time. Training would also be&#13;
coordinated with other aspects of the project, including civil works and delivery of&#13;
equipment, materials and books.&#13;
Institution Building and TA (Base cost Y7.9 million)&#13;
30.   The project would develop local management capabilities for the primary education&#13;
system at county, township and village level through staff training, the provision of&#13;
equipment and expert services. Training for local education managers would include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                               Annex 2&#13;
modem techniques and methods in education management and resource utilization,&#13;
supervision and monitoring methods, study of lessons and experiences gained from both&#13;
project and other areas to develop local policies, and problem-solving skills targeting&#13;
project areas. County education managers would also be trained in the use of computers&#13;
and software for data collection, processing, and basic analysis to assist education&#13;
management and supervision.&#13;
31.   Under the project, provincial education bureaus would provide the lead role in&#13;
technical assistance for the design and implementation of education activities. The&#13;
involvement of provincial education bureaus is essential in order to (a) maintain the&#13;
technical standards and content of the intervention carried out under the component, (b)&#13;
coordinate teacher and management training at the provincial level, and (c) monitor and&#13;
evaluate project activities. It is hoped that the provincial bureaus would be able to&#13;
contribute additional financial resources to expand secondary education coverage (building&#13;
upon the project component). Additionally, the provincial bureaus would assist in ensuring&#13;
that there would be no deterioration in basic education status in non-project counties (which&#13;
might be brought about by the diversion of funding from non-project counties).&#13;
Sustainability of the Component&#13;
32.   Investments in school places, equipment, and teacher training are easily accepted.&#13;
However, strategies concerning tuition assistance and in-school nutrition interventions are&#13;
often resisted. The most common argument against the approach is that it is unsustainable&#13;
in the long-run. This view point underestimates the government's and local communities'&#13;
commitment and ability to support basic education in poor areas. First, although the project&#13;
can help with the up-front investment in increasing supplies, it is governments' obligation&#13;
to fund most of school recurrent costs in the long-run, and provide universal primary&#13;
education, with or without the project. According to the World Bank (1992) report, to fully&#13;
fund the requirements (including recurrent costs) of universal education in the poor areas,&#13;
would only cost about 0.5 percent of total government expenditure in 1992. With the&#13;
project, the government should only reach the goal sooner. Hence, the government has the&#13;
ability to accomplish the goal. In its 8-7 plan, the government has demonstrated its&#13;
commitment. Second, it is not on the supply side that the problem of sustainability is to be&#13;
found. The major constraint on sustainability resides rather in the area of maintaining&#13;
demand. Poverty is the main but not the sole reason for the low demand for education.&#13;
The most effective way to increase demand for education is through demonstration of its&#13;
benefits and mobilization of local community support. Strategies to sustain the delivery of&#13;
quality primary education to all school-age children in the poor areas should be sought from&#13;
both the supply and demand side of education. The development of these strategies must&#13;
also take into account the diverse cultural, economic and demographic factors and rely on&#13;
participation of communities and local governments.&#13;

Health Sector Subcomponent&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Health and poverty are closely linked.  Basic investments in health are key&#13;
ingredients for effective poverty reduction. Enhancing the health of the poor not only&#13;
provides the immediate welfare gain of relief from physical suffering but improves their&#13;
ability to be productive and earn income. Thus, progress in health status can help lift&#13;
a person from poverty and can impact a country's economic performance and growth.&#13;
2.    Fortunately, relatively modest investments in basic preventive health care have&#13;
proven to be extremely cost-effective. These basic health interventions should be, at&#13;
least in part, provided by the Government because: (a) the poor cannot always afford&#13;
health care that would improve their productivity and well-being; (b) some actions that&#13;
produce health are pure public goods or create large positive externalities - private&#13;
markets would not produce them at all or would produce too little; and (c) market&#13;
failures in health care and health insurance mean that Government intervention can raise&#13;
welfare by improving how those markets function.'&#13;
3.    Overall, China has made tremendous strides in enhancing the health of its&#13;
population. However, progress has been uneven and there are areas of China where&#13;
health status is abysmally low. This project by targeting basic health services to the&#13;
absolute poor seeks to assist the Government in raising the health status and thus the&#13;
productivity of the most needy.&#13;
Sector Background&#13;
4.    China has obtained a national health status comparable to many middle income&#13;
countries with an infant mortality rate (IMR) of 35 per 1000 live births, a maternal&#13;
mortality ratio (MMR) of 88 per 100,000 live births, and a life expectancy at birth of 69&#13;
years.2 Furthermore, according to the World Bank's World Development Report (WDR)&#13;
1993 measure of the burden of disease, China's per capita losses from disease are less&#13;
I World Bank, 1993. World Development Report.&#13;
2 These represent official figures. IMR is from the unadjusted 1990 Census - first six months' births and deaths.&#13;
MMR rates are estimated from the 1989-91 Maternal Mortality Surveillance summary by region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                                Annex 3&#13;
than those of any region except the established market economies and the formerly&#13;
socialist economies of Europe. However, these national averages obscure significant&#13;
regional variations with health status almost always worse in rural parts of the country.&#13;
5.    While the absolute poor in China have never had sufficient access to health&#13;
services, what services were available may have decreased during the 1980s due to a&#13;
relative reduction in public financing for health and the institution of the fee for service&#13;
health care versus commune system. During the 1980s, the Govermnent began to require&#13;
that health services recover an increasing part of their costs, thus, there has been a&#13;
tendency on the part of providers to emphasize lucrative, and often unnecessary tests,&#13;
drugs and clinical services at the expense of preventive care. This problem is illustrated&#13;
by the fact that real per capita health spending (from all sources-budgets, fees and&#13;
insurance) rose faster (11 percent) than economic growth (8.7 percent) between 1980 and&#13;
1988, budgetary spending declined from 30 percent of the total health spending to 19&#13;
percent during the same time period.&#13;
6.    Besides a relative decline in financing, the nrual areas have suffered from&#13;
deteriorating health infrastructure, decreasing personnel and, at times, slowing declines&#13;
and even reversals in the prevalence of some diseases. While in China, on average, the&#13;
number of health institutions and number of personnel and doctors increased each year&#13;
from the mid-1970s through the 1980s, this was not the case in the rural townships and&#13;
villages. The number of township health centers and hospitals declined by about 15&#13;
percent from a peak of 55,000 in the early 1980s to 47,400 in the mid-1980s.&#13;
Furthermore, Government support for rural doctors decreased by 45 percent in real terms&#13;
during 1979-87 and the number of village level doctors and midwives declined from 2.2&#13;
million in 1975 to 1.7 million in 1988.3&#13;
7.    From the above, it is not surprising that while morbidity and mortality from&#13;
infectious and communicable diseases continue to decline for China as a whole, levels&#13;
of these diseases are much higher in poor areas. While data about disease trends in these&#13;
areas may not be reliable, data based on provincial averages show that there are&#13;
substantial parts of China where declines in the prevalence of some diseases have slowed&#13;
(tuberculosis) and even reversed (schistosomiasis, iodine deficiency disorders and&#13;
fluorosis)4. Even where deterioration of health status may not have occurred, there are&#13;

still some poor areas where between 10 and 20 percent of the population suffers high&#13;
levels of acute respiratory disease, tuberculosis, pneumonia, dysentery, parasitic diseases&#13;
and micronutrient deficiencies5.&#13;
Health Issues in Project Provinces&#13;
8.     Health issues in project areas mirror the rural health problems mentioned above&#13;
but perhaps may be more severe given the fact that project activity is focussed on the&#13;
poorest of the poor. Compared to the national average and better-off areas, health status&#13;
in project provinces is abysmally low. For example, while the IMR per 1,000 live births&#13;
in Beijing, Jilin, and Shandong is 11, 27, and 17 respectively, the IMR in Guizhou,&#13;
Guangxi, and Yunnan is 68, 60, and 74. Similarly, MMRs for the first group of&#13;
provinces are 40, 47, and 40 respectively, while for the second group MMRs&#13;
approximate 170, 73, 170. Given that the project targets the poorest townships in the&#13;
poorest counties within the Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, it is certain that&#13;
corresponding indicators are even lower in project areas 6.&#13;
9.     From  the above indicators, it is no surprise that health expenditures in project&#13;
areas are quite low. For example, China, on average, spends approximately $11 per&#13;
capita for health care of which approximately $6.5 of this figure represents public sector&#13;
expenditures. In the project counties, annual per capita health expenditures is only about&#13;
11 cents in Guizhou, 17 cents in Guangxi, and 44 cents in Yunnan7. SSB survey data&#13;
(para. 3.39) found that approximately 90 percent of the poorest in the project areas&#13;
cannot afford to pay for medical services. Almost half of the project villages do not have&#13;
a health post, so villagers must travel on average at least 4 km to reach a health facility.&#13;
10.    Consistent with high levels of poverty and low levels of health sector financing&#13;
and an inadequate number of facilities, project areas suffer from dilapidated facilities,&#13;
insufficient equipment, grossly inadequate salaries and numbers of personnel, inadequate&#13;
training, and a health system which suffers from ineffective management and&#13;
coordination. These issues are explained in greater detail in the following section.&#13;

6 A survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Health in 1989 found that infant mortality exceeded 100 per 1000&#13;
and maternal mortality exceeded 300 per 100,000 in some poor and remote areas of China. Furthermore, analysis&#13;
undertaken in the World Bank's document China, Strategies for Reducing Poverty in the 1990s argues that due to, among&#13;
other things, sampling techniques and the inability to accurately report mortality in the poor areas, these rates are even&#13;
higher.&#13;

Project Description&#13;
11.   The project responds to the above health sector issues by financing health facility&#13;
construction and renovation, health worker and birth attendant training, salary increments&#13;
for health workers, funding for primary health care medicine and supplies, and activities&#13;
to strengthen disease prevention and control, maternal and child health care and health&#13;
system management. The base cost of the health subcomponent is Y178.3 million,&#13;
including Y109.3 million for village level development, Y43.8 million for township level&#13;
development, Y9.2 million for Disease Prevention and Control, Y7.8 million for&#13;
Maternal and Child Health, Y3.9 million for County Level Supervision and Management,&#13;
and Y4.3 million for Provincial Level Supervision and Management.&#13;
Village Level Development&#13;
12.   Village Health Clinic Renovation and Construction (Base Cost Y23,027,650).&#13;
Almost half of the project villages do not have a health post and those that exist are&#13;
invariably dilapidated. During the first 18 months of the project, all villages would&#13;
either upgrade existing health clinics or construct new ones. The standard for the village&#13;
health post is four rooms with a total area of 50 square meters. The cost of construction&#13;
for a typical health clinic is estimated to be about Y250 to Y300 per square meter.&#13;
Approximately 1,700 village health posts would be built or upgraded.&#13;
13.   Equipment for the Village Health Post (Base Cost Y6,908,000). Many of the&#13;
village health posts lack essential equipment to provide even the basic of health care.&#13;
Thus, a standard set of equipment (Table 1) would be provided to each village health&#13;
post.&#13;
14.   Training for Village Health Workers and Birth Attendants (Base Cost&#13;
Y10,464,000 of which Y6,278,400 is for village health worker training and 4,185,600&#13;
for birth attendant training). The care practices and skills of health staff at all, but&#13;
particularly lower levels, is problematic. For example, treatment of common illnesses&#13;
such as pneumonia or diarrhea is often inappropriate. Furthermore, complications and&#13;
high risk conditions in pregnancy, such as anemia, are often not managed correctly,&#13;
monitoring of labor is rarely done, and referral of emergencies is not planned in advance.&#13;
Approximately 1,750 health workers and 3,500 birth attendants would be provided&#13;
training.&#13;
a.  Training for Village Health Aides. In response to inadequate training, the&#13;
project would provide training for new and existing health aides. Approximately&#13;
1,750 new health aides, one per village, would be trained during the first three&#13;
years of the project. The selection criteria for new health aides is: minimum&#13;
junior high school education, under 30 years of age, and native to the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                              Annex 3&#13;
area. The project would provide full tuition and living expenses at a cost of&#13;
Y3,600 per person. Prior to training the health aide must agree, via a signed&#13;
contract, to return to her home village for a minimum of 6 years of service.&#13;
The project would retrain existing health aides under 50 years of age with at least&#13;
a junior high school education level who are willing to attend a one-year re-&#13;
training program at selected health schools. One existing health worker would&#13;
be retrained with the objective of having a maximnum of two aides per village&#13;
including the newly trained aides. The estimated cost for the one year re-training&#13;
is Y1,800 not including living expenses. During training the health worker would&#13;
receive a salary for living expenses.&#13;
b.    Training of Birth Attendants.  For each of the project villages, an&#13;
average of two to three birth attendants would be trained for a total of six&#13;
months. Selection criteria would require that trainees be women over age 18,&#13;
with a minimum of elementary school education. Preference would be given to&#13;
those already in practice as birth attendants. The attendants would be qualified to&#13;
receive payment from the case management fund under the Maternal and Child&#13;
portion of this project. The Birth Attendants would: manage pregnancy, birth,&#13;
and post-partum care; conduct delivery; and assist village health workers in&#13;
providing primary health care.&#13;
15.   Salary  Increment for Existing  and  New  Village  Health  Workers&#13;
(Y21,987,000). In all project areas health worker salaries are abysmally low resulting&#13;
in low retention rates or health workers splitting their time between health tasks and other&#13;
income generating activities such as farming. In order to off-set the low salary, the&#13;
project would provide a salary increment to 4,101 health workers. During the initial three&#13;
years, the project would provide all the salary in the cases of Guangxi and Guizhou (in&#13;
both of these provinces there currently is no village health aide salary) and in Yunnan,&#13;
where village health aides currently receive Y20 to Y50, a portion of the salary. The&#13;
base salary of all village health workers would be 80 percent of the proposed monthly&#13;
salary of Y80- YIOO. If the village health aide performs according to standard, the&#13;
remaining 20 percent would also be given on an annual basis. Additional monies would&#13;
be provided to health workers for immunization, birth and death reporting and disease&#13;
surveillance.&#13;
16.   Village Health Care Cooperative Fund (Base Cost Y46,922,614). At the village&#13;
level, the stock of essential curative and preventive medicines and supplies is incomplete&#13;
and insufficient. In response to this problem, a health care cooperative would be created&#13;
to insure the availability of curative and preventive medicines and supplies. The fund&#13;
would have three revenue streams: (i) funds from the project, provided on a decreasing&#13;
per capita basis, (ii) community contributions, which increase as a share of total funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                             Annex 3&#13;
over a five-year period, and (iii) revenues from the sale of curative and preventive&#13;
medicines at discounted prices (See Chart #1 for the projected flow of funds over the&#13;
five-year period). Individual members would be charged 30 percent of the actual cost&#13;
of medicines and supplies.&#13;

17.   The cooperative fund would be managed by the preventive health service at the&#13;
township hospital. The township public health worker assigned to each administrative&#13;
village would have fund oversight responsibility. Fund operations would be monitored&#13;
by a village health fund committee.&#13;
18.  In order to ensure appropriate operation of fund, the following guidelines would&#13;
be instituted: (a) for each case, the medical condition, medications used, and amount of&#13;
co-payment fee collected would be documented; (b) the resupply of pharmaceutical would&#13;
be based on actual record of utilization thereby guarding against shortages and&#13;
oversupply. The fund would purchase a six month supply of medication and supplies.&#13;
Every three months the fund would be charged for the resupply of stock. To ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                             Annex 3&#13;
appropriate inventory as well as to encourage appropriate use of pharmaceutical, 30&#13;
essential and commonly used medications would be procured and resupplied with the&#13;
health fund (Table 2). The list of essential drugs is a modified version recommended by&#13;
the World Health Organization. In addition, approved locally produced low-cost&#13;
traditional medicines could be obtained by the village health aide; (c) the periodic review&#13;
by the township village health supervisor of the appropriateness of the medication usage;&#13;
and (d) the compilation of an annual statistical summary of usage pattern of all village&#13;
health clinics to detect outlyers.&#13;
Township Level Development&#13;
19.   Construction and Expansion of Township Hospitals (Base Cost Y19,106,000).&#13;
While the majority of the project townships have existing hospitals, for practical&#13;
purposes, they are outpatient clinics with a few beds and are in dilapidated condition. In&#13;
response to these small and deteriorated facilities, the project would rehabilitate and&#13;
expand existing township hospitals. Currently, the size of these hospitals ranges from&#13;
100 to 400 square meters. The project would expand each township hospital by&#13;
approximately 200 square meters which would house the preventive service office. This&#13;
additional space would house a training classroom for village health workers, and&#13;
increase outpatient and pharmacy facilities.&#13;
20.   Equipment for Township Hospitals (Base Cost Y9,280,000 for standard set of&#13;
equipment; Y1,260 for x-ray machines; and Y4,350,000 for motorcycles). Many of the&#13;
township hospitals lack basic equipment. Thus, the project would provide basic sets of&#13;
equipment to approximately 290 hospitals (Table 3). The project would also provide&#13;
x-ray equipment to 70 township center hospitals and 290 motorcycles for village visits&#13;
to transport vaccines.&#13;
21.   Township Health Workers Training. (Base Cost Y4,350,000). Similar to the&#13;
situation with village health workers, the training for township health workers is&#13;
inadequate. Approximately two existing township health workers at each of the project&#13;
township hospitals would be reassigned from clinical work to become full-time preventive&#13;
health workers. During the project period, each newly reassigned preventive service staff&#13;
would receive a total of six to nine months training at the health school, anti-epidemic&#13;
station and child health office. Other clinic staff would receive one to two months&#13;
training related to preventive services.&#13;
22.   Salary Assistance For The Township Preventive Health Care Workers (Base&#13;
Cost Y5,421,600). To off-set the low salaries of township preventive health care&#13;
workers, the project would provide a salary top-off to the 753 full-time preventive health&#13;
care workers of Y100 over their base salary of Y100-200 provided by the local&#13;
government. These township preventive health care workers would: (a) support and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                             Anne_  3&#13;
supervise village level primary health care activities; (b) provide training for the village&#13;
level health workers; (c) conduct surveillance for disease, water quality, and health&#13;
statistics; (d) supervise and take part in managing the village health cooperative fund; and&#13;
(e) provide disease surveillance and reporting at the township level.&#13;
23.   Enhancing Access to Medical Service at the Township Hospital. The high&#13;
costs of services often impede access of the poor to township hospitals. In order to&#13;
enhance access of the poor to hospital services, the poor would only pay for the cost of&#13;
services, not including any related profits generated by delivery of health care services.&#13;
For selected conditions related to maternal and child health, such as post-partum&#13;
complications and neonatal pneumonia, the cost of the care could be provided by the&#13;
MCH case management fund. Each province would develop a detailed procedure to&#13;
assure improved access of the poor to township medical service.&#13;
Disease Prevention and Control&#13;
24.   Disease Surveillance System. (Cost Y1,750,000). Reliable data on mortality&#13;
and morbidity is very important for designing and evaluating health interventions. The&#13;
project would implement a disease surveillance system which would systematize birth,&#13;
death, and communicable disease reporting and undertake investigation of communicable&#13;
disease outbreaks. The estimated cost of the disease surveillance system is based on the&#13;
population covered and 20 percent additional cost for administrative and outbreak&#13;
investigations.&#13;
25.   Seroprevalence Survey for Communicable Disease (Base Cost Y1,312,500).&#13;
To monitor the pattern of major communicable diseases with high outbreak potential,&#13;
a serological survey would be conducted each year for: measles, meningitis, and&#13;
encephalitis.&#13;
26.   Cold Storage Unit (Base Cost Y875,000). To ensure safe storage of vaccine,&#13;
cold storage units would be provided (one per county). The estimated cost of each unit&#13;
is Y25,000.&#13;
27.   Vaccine and Special Medication (Base Cost Y3,500,000). To enhance the&#13;
control of Typhoid Fever, and TB, and the reduction of neonatal tetanus, the project&#13;
would provide: (a) vaccine for Typhoid Fever in endemic areas - estimated 60,000&#13;
persons per year at Y5 per person; (b) Tetanus for pregnant women - estimated at YO.5&#13;
per person for 6,000-10,000 women per province each year; and (c) medication for TB&#13;
case management; chemotherapy for each case requires Y250 of medication per year.&#13;
The estimated case load within the project areas is about 3000 cases for each province.&#13;
All activities would be implemented by village health workers under the supervision of&#13;
the township preventive health service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                              Annex 3&#13;
28.   Water Monitoring Equipment (Base Cost Y1,050,000). To  provide proper&#13;
monitoring and control of safe drinking water the project would provide a periodic&#13;
assessment of all local common drinking water. Each county would receive a set of&#13;
instruments to monitor water quality. The cost per set is 30,000 yuan.&#13;
29.   Chemical Treatment for Drinking Water Source (Base Cost Y709, 116).&#13;
Chemicals would be provided on a routine basis to treat village water supply. A village&#13;
health worker would conduct the treatment. The estimated water treatment chemical cost&#13;
is approximately YO.25 per person per year.&#13;
Maternal and Child Health&#13;
30.   MCH Case Management (Base Cost Y7,500,000). To enhance pre-natal care&#13;
and routine child care and decrease child delivery complications, the village health&#13;
worker and birth attendant would be paid for each pregnancy and delivery that was&#13;
managed up to the practice standard. In addition, because a major reason for the lack&#13;
of utilization of MCH service is the inability of poor households to purchase health&#13;
worker services, project monies would also finance nominal incentives for the utilization&#13;
of MCH primary health services. The estimated cost is Y25 per delivery: the health&#13;
worker or the birth attendant would receive Y17 for providing pre-natal care and clean&#13;
delivery, and the mother would receive Y6 for taking part in the program. In addition,&#13;
about 8 percent of the MCH management monies would be set aside for the medical care&#13;
cost of complicated pregnancies, delivery and neonatal care requiring referral to&#13;
township and county hospitals. The administrative procedures for this portion of the&#13;
health project would be developed and supervised by the county MCH office.&#13;
31.   Nutrition Surveillance (Base Cost Y340,000). To develop a routine monitoring&#13;
system for childhood nutritional status as part of project monitoring activities, a subset&#13;
of the project villages would be used as monitoring sites. At those sites, the village&#13;
health aides would routinely measure and record the height and weight of infants and&#13;
children at a certain age. The scope of this surveillance system is about 1/10 of all&#13;
project villages. The cost would equal approximately Y400-500 each year for the village&#13;
health aides to conduct the measurements based on a cost of YO.5 per measurement&#13;
recorded. The surveillance system would be managed by the county and provincial MCH&#13;
office. An annual summary would be the main output of this surveillance system.&#13;
County Level Project Management&#13;
32.   County Staff Training (Base Cost Y840,000) To address inadequate health care&#13;
management at the county level, under the project, all key project personnel at each&#13;
county would receive an average of four months of management training. Approximately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                             Annex 3&#13;
six persons from each county would be trained at an average cost of Y1000 per month&#13;
of training.&#13;
33.   Project Management Office Equipment (Base Cost Y950,000) All county&#13;
health and provincial project offices would receive one set of office equipment which&#13;
includes: a personal computer and printer. The estimated cost for this equipment is&#13;
Y25,000 per set.&#13;
Provincial Level Project Management&#13;
34.   Technical Assistance  (Base Cost Y738,000).  The project would provide&#13;
approximnately 36 advisors or consultants to assist in program development and&#13;
monitoring. Advice would be sought concerning, among other things, training content&#13;
for the village health aides and birth attendants, system improvement for disease&#13;
monitoring and control, nutrition surveillance system training and implementation, and&#13;
program management. To the extent possible, the three project provinces would share&#13;
resources in the utilization of technical assistance. The estimated cost is Y87,000 per&#13;
foreign consultant, and Y18,000 per domestic consultant based on an average period of&#13;
2 to 3 weeks.&#13;
35.   Study Tours. (Base Cost Y840,000). For each province, approximately 7 study&#13;
tour opportunities would be provided for county or provincial project staff to visit other&#13;
developing countries where there has been successful reform or development of primary&#13;
health care. This activity is budgeted at Y40,000 per trip.&#13;
36.   Provincial Staff Training (Base Cost Y72,000). Six key personnel from each&#13;
provincial project office would receive training dealing with the management of the&#13;
various new activities. The average cost is Y4,000 per person trained.&#13;
37.   Management Fee (Base Cost Y2,634,802). Project management would occur&#13;
through the health office at the provincial level. Project monies would support routine&#13;
office expenditures such as printing, supplies, telephone, local travel for project support&#13;
and supervision for the World Bank loan office within the Bureau of Public Health. No&#13;
salaries would be charged to the project for provincial level management.&#13;
38.   Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost Y2,100,000). In order to monitor and&#13;
evaluate project impact, major indicators such as infant mortality, maternal mortality, and&#13;
nutritional status would be collected at the start, middle and end of the project. The&#13;
majority of the monitoring activities would be conducted within the health system with&#13;
supervision and support from outside institutions. This part of the evaluation cost is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

mainly intended for measuring activities outside of the project areas for comparison&#13;
purpose. Within the project areas, the cost of monitoring, to an extent, can be charged&#13;
to the project at the county level as part of the disease surveillance activities.&#13;

Southwest China Poverty Reduction Project&#13;
Labor Mobility Component&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     This component is part of an integrated approach to reduce absolute poverty in upland areas of&#13;
Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces. A cost-effective labor mobility system which responds to&#13;
employer requirements and the needs of migrants is a powerful means of poverty reduction. Labor&#13;
mobility activities do not involve any temporary or permanent resettlement of families or mandatory&#13;
relocation of individuals. This is a strictly voluntary program for individual surplus laborers built on&#13;
existing Labor Bureau activities.'&#13;
2.     This component would address existing labor market imperfections with a system of "pump&#13;
priming" interventions to improve the flow of market information to poor upland households in project&#13;
counties. The first step would be an affirmative action approach to assist 343,000 surplus laborers to&#13;
obtain employment in fastgrowing urban labor markets.&#13;
3.     The Labor Mobility Component would provide safeguards as part of an organized market-&#13;
friendly means to allow the absolute poor to gain a share of benefits from the large scale rural-to-urban&#13;
migration already underway. It would (a) provide incentives to firms and training centers to provide&#13;
basic vocational training and (b) locate safe, stable off-farm employment opportunities for 343,000&#13;
upland surplus laborers. Wage earners would be encouraged to remit funds to their households in&#13;
project areas through secure channels to cover labor mobility costs, school fees, medical expenses,&#13;
agricultural inputs and other expenses. Special safeguards would be developed to protect the most&#13;
vulnerable migrants, including the large numbers of women and minorities expected to take advantage&#13;
of the labor mobility opportunity.&#13;
Recent History of Labor Mobility&#13;
4.     Large scale migration began in the late 1980s, encouraged by increasingly liberalized labor&#13;
markets and rapid economic growth in coastal urban centers. Millions of rural surplus laborers have&#13;
few alternatives: agricultural jobs are only expected to grow marginally in the 1990s (at about 0.8&#13;
percent per year), compared to annual growth of 2.5 percent from  1985 to 1990.2  There is an&#13;
enormous economic incentive to move to the cities: those who obtain jobs in urban areas can earn ten&#13;
to twenty times more than the per capita income of those who remain in upland villages.3 There are&#13;

also incentives for the firms, as local wage costs in coastal markets have risen. If labor mobility&#13;
restrictions return, many firms would face the daunting task of replacing cheap migrant labor with&#13;
labor-replacing machinery.'&#13;
5.      An in-depth study of the issues contributing to poverty in China recommended a series of&#13;
strategies to reduce absolute poverty during the 1990s. The study suggested, among other initiatives,&#13;
that "all opportunities for expanding out-migration of surplus labor from the poor areas be explored".'&#13;
Labor market specialists attending an international seminar in Beijing in 1992 reviewed the findings of&#13;
the study and similar investigations. These experts confirmed the critical need for policies and projects&#13;
to promote orderly out-migration from upland areas to fastgrowing cities.&#13;
6.      A  1994 study by the China Industrial Information Institute reveals important characteristics of&#13;
urban labor markets. Specific labor markets are growing rapidly, including export-oriented textiles,&#13;
electronic assembly and toy factories. Even for sectors with slower growth, urban industrial expansion&#13;
provides tens of thousands of new jobs in shipyards, industrial, commercial, hotel and municipal&#13;
construction. At the same time, the number of reported labor disputes has increased dramatically,&#13;
especially in joint ventures in southern coastal areas.&#13;
7.      There are three important market failures which limit the ability of surplus laborers from poor&#13;
upland households in project areas to take part in growing urban labor markets. The most important&#13;
constraint is the lack of timely, reliable labor market information. The importance of informal&#13;
networks and brokerage firms in providing information about jobs was confirmed by a review of Labor&#13;
Bureau statistics representing 810,000 migrant workers working in Jiangsu, Dongguan, Guangzhou and&#13;
Zhejiang. In Jiangsu, 80 percent of migrants used these channels, while it is more than 90 percent in&#13;
the other labor markets.6 Most upland households with surplus laborers do no have such social&#13;
networks or other ways to find out about job opportunities in nearby towns or distant cities -- and this&#13;
is especially true for minority groups.7&#13;
8.      Upland households with surplus laborers face two additional labor market imperfections: (a)&#13;
the lack of rudimentary knowledge and skills required by urban growth pole jobs, and (b) inadequate&#13;
funds for a job search outside the local area. A review of the qualifications of employed migrant&#13;
workers in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian found that only 13.3 percent had not completed&#13;
primary school.8 In contrast, the adult illiteracy rate in project areas in Yunnan is about 47 percent.9&#13;

A 1994 State Statistics Bureau (SSB) survey of 600 households in project areas found that 56 percent&#13;
of adults were illiterate, and another 19 percent did not complete primary school. The high share of&#13;
ethnic minority people in project areas also means that many lack strong Han language skills.&#13;
Scale of Labor Mobility&#13;
9.      The scale of informal labor migration is much greater than labor mobility through organized&#13;
channels. Ministry of Labor (MOL) researchers set interprovincial migration at 20 million, with an&#13;
additional 35 million shifting locally.'Â° The Ministry of Agriculture's Office of Rural Reform&#13;
estimates 70 million seasonal and permanent migrants in 1994, a 10 percent increase from the previous&#13;
year. The Urban Construction Ministry's 1990 survey estimated that there were 37 to 40 million rural&#13;
laborers working in cities.&#13;
10.   In the three project provinces, migrants using informal channels far outnumber those who rely&#13;
on governmental programs. The Yunnan Provincial Labor Bureau organized the migration of 48,000&#13;
workers in 1993, but estimates that an additional 300,000 people searched for jobs without assistance.&#13;
The Guizhou Provincial Labor Bureau found employment for 60,000 people in 1992, mostly in the toy,&#13;
fireworks and electronics factories and service industries of Guangdong. An additional 220,000 used&#13;
spontaneous channels." MOL officials believe that a large share of migrants using the riskier channels&#13;
are from poor upland households.&#13;
11.    The magnitude of the problem continues to grow in project areas. A 1994 study by the Leading&#13;
Group on Poverty Reduction (LGPR) found that about 2.2 million people in project areas depend&#13;
primarily on income generated by agricultural activities. Of this population, 738,000 (33.5 percent) are&#13;
classified as surplus laborers. According to Yunnan Provincial Labor Bureau officials, 400,000 people&#13;
are unemployed (22 percent of the rural work force). In poor counties, the situation is more&#13;
pronounced: Wuding County officials estimate that 40 percent of rural workers are surplus laborers&#13;
during periods of peak labor demand. A 1994 SSB sample survey found that 53 percent of adults were&#13;
interested in jobs outside the village, and most would accept a monthly wage of only Y100.&#13;
12.   A profile of surplus laborers in project areas identifies a large pool of potentially productive&#13;
workers, although the need for basic skills training is clear. Government estimates show that more than&#13;
75 percent of surplus laborers are between the ages of 16 and 35. Thirty-five percent of these&#13;
unemployed people have completed primary school education, with another 15 percent classified as&#13;
illiterate.&#13;

13.    There is widespread acceptance that the urban population will continue to grow rapidly, despite&#13;
more favorable general demographic trends.'2  A  1992 Bank Group study points out that "(due to) a&#13;
delayed response to fertility trends of the 1970s, the absolute annual increase in the total working age&#13;
population declined from about 19 million during the first half of the 1980s to about 14 million during&#13;
the second half."'3 Since the "one child policy" is prevalent in urban areas, much of the anticipated&#13;
growth in the urban population will be the result of migration from rural areas.&#13;
14.    Specific estimates of the contribution of migrant labor in rapid urban population growth differ&#13;
markedly. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the urban population is expected to&#13;
grow by 377 million by 2010. This translates into the need to create 17 to 18 million urban jobs&#13;
annually.'4  A  State Council Development Research Center survey of 22 cities and counties in five&#13;
southwestern provinces estimates that there would be 32 million surplus laborers by that time.'5&#13;
Causes of Labor Mobility&#13;
15.    There are five causes for massive rural-to-urban migration: (a) worsening terms of trade and&#13;
living conditions in uplands counties of the southwestern and western provinces, (b) labor-intensive joint&#13;
ventures and township and village enterprises (TVEs) spawned by economic liberalization and financial&#13;
reform, (c) an unprecedented construction, investment and production boom in many southern coastal&#13;
cities, and moderate growth in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, (d) relaxation of worker permit and&#13;
residency restrictions in many towns and cities, and (e) official reconsideration of urban employment&#13;
policies.&#13;
16.    Rural Terms of Trade  There is strong evidence that the gap between rural and urban incomes&#13;
is widening. In 1978, urban per capita cash income was 2.33 times greater than the rural equivalent.&#13;
Following a drop to only 1.71 in 1984, the ratio has risen steeply to 2.54 by 1993. While real rural&#13;
income grew by 3.2 percent to Y910 in 1993, urban per capita income increased by 10.2 percent to&#13;
almost Y2300. 16 With non-wage factors such as grain and housing subsidies, the gap is even greater.&#13;
17.    There are indications that regional disparities are large and growing. According to a 1991 SSB&#13;
study, 29.2 percent of those under the poverty line are in the Southwest Provinces, while only 1.2&#13;
percent are in the southern provinces (Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan).'7 Wage rate differences&#13;
12/ This consensus can be seen in the results of the Seminar on Rural Migration sponsored by the Institute of Rural Development. It brought together&#13;
analysts and government officials to review the situation. (Journal of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, No. 113. No. 5, 1994)&#13;

figure.&#13;

between rural areas in different provinces have also grown. A nationwide survey of 67,000 households&#13;
found that the gap had jumped from a 300 percent difference in 1982 to 560 percent by 1993. 1i&#13;
18.    TVE and Joint Venture Growth  TVEs have been one of the most dynamic sectors of the&#13;
economic boom in China in the past ten years. In the first quarter of 1994, TVE sales amounted to&#13;
Y494 billion ($57 billion), an increase of 83 percent over the first three months of 1993. The&#13;
Southwest Provinces have shown surprisingly rapid TVE growth: fixed asset investment in Guangxi&#13;
grew from Y7.2 billion to Y14.2 billion during 1993, representing real growth of 72 percent."9 TVEs&#13;
also make an important contribution to local employment, providing jobs for 11 percent of the rural&#13;
work force in Yunnan and almost 10 percent in Guizhou. However, TVEs have not kept pace in project&#13;
areas, due to the lack of basic infrastructure and investment capital has blocked the development of&#13;
agroprocessing, mineral processing and other industries.&#13;
19.    Joint venture investments have also jumped dramatically. Direct foreign investment was $25.8&#13;
billion in 1993 and $14.7 billion for the first half of 1994.2Â° This represents a substantial increase&#13;
from  1991, when foreign investment amounted to disbursements of $4.4 billion and commitments of&#13;
$12 billion. The majority were ventures involving less than half a million dollars in foreign funding.&#13;
In 1994, 5,500 new foreign investments were approved, mostly in labor-intensive manufacturing&#13;
industries such as toys, textiles and electronics.&#13;
20.    Changes in Urban Labor Market Policies  Urban workers have historically received favorable&#13;
treatment. The "iron rice bowl" system for urban workers has been characterized by (a) lifetime&#13;
employment with subsidies for housing, grain and health care, (b) wages which were not linked to&#13;
productivity, and (c) strict enforcement of the "hukou" residency registration system. The risk of urban&#13;
upheaval led to strict enforcement of residency registration from 1949 through the late 1970s.2'&#13;
21.    The economic reforms of the late 1970s led to increased demand for low skill laborers and a&#13;
more flexible interpretation of residency. When urban unemployment declined to nominal levels in&#13;
1983, millions of rural workers were permitted to migrate, temporarily or permanently, to the cities.&#13;
By 1984, there were few restrictions, as long as rural migrants could provide their own grain supply.&#13;
A 1986 CASS review of 90,000 laborers in 100 villages in four coastal provinces revealed that rural-to-&#13;
urban migration was an established practice, with migrants making up 17.6 percent of the labor force.&#13;
22.    To accommodate the demand for low skilled laborers, new legal definitions were developed for&#13;
rural laborers in urban firms. These include "workers outside the plan" and "rotation workers". These&#13;
workers can earn comparable wages, although non-wage benefits are limited. The system gained greater&#13;

legitimacy following State Council pronouncements in 1986, since it was consistent with state-owned&#13;
enterprise reforms giving firms control over hiring, wage levels and benefits. In August, 1989, it was&#13;
estimated that state-owned enterprises employed 13.3 million "temporary workers and workers outside&#13;
the plan" (of a total work force of 99.6 million).22 However, the urban social service safety net for&#13;
registered workers does not provide for rural migrants -- their safety net "consists of no more than a&#13;
ticket back to their area of origin. "23 A 1992 campaign against "the three irons" (the "iron rice bowl",&#13;
the "iron post" of lifelong tenure for enterprise officials, and the "iron wage packet" and subsidies)&#13;
reportedly met with widespread worker unrest.24&#13;
Effects of Labor Mobility&#13;
23.    Benefits of Labor Mobility  Interviews in upland counties in Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces&#13;
revealed that the household would benefit greatly by the decreased demand on its meager food supply,&#13;
even without remiUtances from migrants.2I Chronic grain deficits at the village and household level&#13;
increase the urgency of labor migration. Remittances are frequently used for basic necessities such as&#13;
farm inputs, school fees, medical expenses, and improvements to the walls and roof of the house. A&#13;
small share of remittances is often saved for the migrant worker, who typically returns to the area after&#13;
three to five years. These funds become the working capital for the migrant to establish a small&#13;
enterprise.26 Table 1 presents a list of benefits and risks from the household's perspective.&#13;
24.    Reported remittance levels reveal the promise of labor mobility as a source of cash income for&#13;
upland poor households and the local economy. The MOL estimated that 37 million rural migrants in&#13;
23 large cities remitted Y75 billion to their families. The annual per capita contribution of Y2000 per&#13;
migrant is far greater than per capita income for other rural households in poor counties (Y300) and&#13;
would help to meet the goal of Y500 established by the National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan. The&#13;
Guizhou Labor Bureau reported remittances of more than Y2 billion, sent by 800,000 women and&#13;
200,000 men outside the province. In some cases the remittances exceeded the county government's&#13;
own annual revenues.27&#13;
25.    Risks of Labor Mobility  Low skilled rural workers using spontaneous channels to find jobs are&#13;
extremely vulnerable to illness, accidents, hidden payroll reductions and other calamities -- in coal&#13;
mines, construction work and assembly line jobs. They often face unsafe working conditions,&#13;
substandard housing, unscrupulous firms, prostitution, and physical abuse. The number of fires and&#13;

other on-site accidents which were reported increased markedly to 38,000 in 1993, as the number of&#13;
joint ventures jumped to 170,000. More than 2400 people died, 5900 were injured and property losses&#13;
amounted to $130 million. In the first half of 1994, more than 1,000 fatalities from  fires have been&#13;
reported, primarily in factories on the southern coast.28 Risks tend to be higher for upland minorities&#13;
and women, due to language difficulties and the growing prostitution trade in some cities.&#13;
26.    Large scale informal migration has contributed to a myriad of urban problems and resulted in&#13;
worker abuses. The arrival of millions of migrants has caused serious strains on urban housing, water,&#13;
sewer, communications, transportation and health systems. Beijing municipal authorities estimate that&#13;
migrants are responsible for 70 percent of crime in parts of the city.29  Although additional housing&#13;
stock is being constructed in cities such as Nanning (in Guangxi Autonomous Region), the rapid&#13;
increased demand for low income housing by migrants has led to the first signs of urban slums.&#13;
27.    Organized labor mobility also poses major organizational challenges for the upland counties as&#13;
well as municipalities which receive large numbers of migrants. Most project county governments do&#13;
not have a training system for surplus laborers, and they lack the funds required to independently&#13;
finance contract arrangements or send representatives to distant labor markets.30 In these counties&#13;
there are few traditional village networks with urban connections, like those in Sichuan and Zhejiang&#13;
Provinces.3' On the receiving end, housing stock is extremely limited and transportation systems can&#13;
be overwhelmed by seasonal demand caused by migrants.&#13;

Government Responses to Labor Mobility&#13;
28.    The scale of rural-to-urban migration and the potential for instability which it represents have&#13;
led to two major policy initiatives in the last two years. The National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan&#13;
(1994) targets the elimination of absolute poverty in China by the Year 2000. The plan calls for&#13;
development of an "organized manpower exports to channel the transfer of manpower out of&#13;
impoverished areas", including employment and technical training. It establishes a goal of moving "a&#13;
single able-bodied member of each household into township and town enterprises or into developed&#13;
areas". This confirms an objective of the new seven year plan, which calls for improved access of the&#13;
poor to employment opportunities outside the poor areas.33&#13;
29.    In 1993, the State Council assigned the responsibility for managing rural labor mobility to the&#13;
Ministries of Labor and Communications.34 Provincial and county labor bureaus have historically been&#13;
responsible for redeployment of urban workers laid off from state-owned enterprises. The MOL has&#13;
kept the urban unemployment rate below 2.5 percent for the past decade, through skills training and&#13;
redeployment of unemployed workers. The MOL responded to the new assignment in November, 1993&#13;
with the Orderly Trans-regional Floating of Rural Labor". This has two objectives: (a) to foster and&#13;
develop the labor markets and (b) to strengthen the Labor Bureau employment service system. The&#13;

33/ This represents a major shift in labor market policies. From 1949 to the late 1970s, urban capital-intensive projects such as the "Third Line" and&#13;

State Council's allocation of Y15 million to the LGPR in 1994 to support interprovincial job placement&#13;
activities confirms its interest in addressing the issue in the short term.&#13;
30.    While there are clear signs of government support, the cost of complying with administrative&#13;
requirements is expensive for both the individual worker and the factory. Fees to the worker's village&#13;
or town can amount to Y300 to Y500, for certificates for family planning, education, and physical&#13;
examination. At the destination, there are additional fees. A work permit costs Y60 and the temporary&#13;
urban residency fee paid by the factory for local infrastructure construction and maintenance can be as&#13;
high as Y350.35 Average costs for the job search through spontaneous channels and employment&#13;
agencies range from Y150 to Y200, and there are reports of widespread abuses in the form of much&#13;
higher informal charges in some labor markets.&#13;
31.    Government willingness to experiment has encouraged new institutional arrangements, including&#13;
employment agencies and regional labor mobility information networks. County and provincial labor&#13;
bureau representation offices have sprung up in major coastal markets to gain a foothold in booming&#13;
urban labor markets. The MOL's Institute of Labor Studies and the Ministry of Agriculture's Office&#13;
of Rural Reform Experimental Areas have taken the lead in managing labor market initiatives.36&#13;
Lessons from the Guangban Municipality Labor Mobility System&#13;
32.    An innovative rural labor mobility initiative in Guanghan Municipality (Sichuan Province) was&#13;
recently highlighted by the National Conference on Rural Labor Resources (See Table 2). Six elements&#13;
have contributed to success: (a) municipal agents in coastal markets, (b) an inventory of surplus&#13;
laborers, (c) short-term skills training in municipal workshops, (d) the use of group contracts, (e)&#13;
carefully planned transportation, and (f) the use of market-oriented labor companies.37&#13;
Rural Labor Migrant Profiles in Proiect Areas&#13;
33.    Rural migrants are typically 16 to 35 years of age, have not completed primary education, and&#13;
have only rudimentary skills. About 50 percent find jobs in small township enterprises, joint ventures&#13;
or private firms, and the remainder work on construction sites or mines.38 Most women find jobs in&#13;
toy and electronics assembly plants, fireworks production and service industries. A 1994 report by the&#13;
Municipality of Shanghai of 113,000 migrant laborers revealed that 64 percent work in textiles,&#13;
construction and heavy industry, 9 percent are employed in machinery repair shops, 8 percent are sales&#13;

staff, and 19 percent fall into other categories. One in eight adults in project areas searched for work&#13;
outside the village, with 33 percent remaining outside for more than 6 months.39&#13;
Table 2: Lessons from Guanghan Municipality&#13;
Seven principles can be extracted from the Guanghan efforts. An effective provincial&#13;
rural labor mobility strategy should attempt to:&#13;
*     Reach the greatest number of surplus laborers for the least cost&#13;
*     Target surplus laborers from poor counties&#13;
*     Develop a cost recovery system&#13;
*     Monitor work place safety and living conditions of the worker&#13;
*      Evaluate enterprise satisfaction with migrant workers&#13;
*      Monitor the effects of labor mobility on the household and village&#13;
*      Adjust rapidly to labor market changes&#13;
34.    Most migrants see urban employment as a short-term economic opportunity, rather than a&#13;
permanent change in residency. Local officials and researchers agree that the majority of rural migrants&#13;
return to upland counties after three to five years, although a significant number marry and remain in&#13;
cities, About 5 percent leave after three months, and an additional 5 percent return before the first one-&#13;
year contract is completed, due to health problems or an inability to adjust to the new setting.4'&#13;
Component Objectives and Activities&#13;
35.    Based on labor market demand and upland surplus labor profiles, the Labor Mobility component&#13;
establishes a cost-effective, market-oriented mechanism to: (a) identify job opportunities in local and&#13;
distant markets for up to 343,000 absolute poor from upland areas over five years and (b) provide basic&#13;
vocational skills and logistical support for voluntary migrants. The system builds on the experience and&#13;
infrastructure of county labor bureaus, and provides necessary safeguards and a monitoring system to&#13;
insure the safety and welfare of workers. Base costs for the component are Y395 million over six&#13;
years, representing 14 percent of project base costs.&#13;
36.    The Labor Mobility component is consistent with government plans to decontrol labor markets&#13;
and remove barriers to rural-to-urban labor mobility. It can provide an important testing ground for&#13;
assisting the flow of rural laborers into China's fast growing small and medium size cities as well as&#13;
large urban centers. Project activities will benefit from ongoing experiments and studies conducted by&#13;
the Ministries of Labor and Agriculture, with support from the Ford Foundation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -                                  Annex 4&#13;
37.   The Labor Mobility Component would improve the effectiveness and outreach of the existing&#13;
labor mobility system by developing:  (a) targeting strategies to reach the absolute poor, (b) a&#13;
computerized information system to provide job market information to project counties, (c) basic&#13;
vocational skills training by reimbursing firms for training costs and by developing links to training&#13;
centers, (d) monitoring systems, and (e) financing and remittance arrangements. (See Table 6 for a&#13;
summary of the labor mobility system.)&#13;
38.   These five elements would contribute to an orderly, safe, productive rural labor transfer without&#13;
leading to a "managed labor system". The project would provide workers with basic skills (by&#13;
reimbursing enterprises for costs) and a one-year contract, renewable based on the needs of the firm&#13;
and the performance of the worker. Firms would receive short term financial incentives and assurances&#13;
of prompt problem resolution from the MOL. It is a "market friendly" approach with adequate&#13;
safeguards and institutional development activities to insure adjustments based on evaluation findings&#13;
and labor market changes. A one-year pilot phase would enable LGPR, the MOL, provincial and&#13;
county labor bureaus to adjust implementation based on expected changes in the regulatory framework&#13;
and labor markets (Annex 4, paras 66-68).41&#13;
39.   Targeting and Orientation  A transparent labor mobility promotion system would be developed&#13;
based on clearly defined criteria to insure appropriate targeting. Community participation would play&#13;
a central role. Administrative and natural village leaders would coordinate planning and promotion&#13;
activities with county labor bureau officials. The project would target surplus laborers who have little&#13;
or no experience working outside the community and come from households with the most surplus&#13;
laborers.&#13;
40.   Candidates would not need a high school diploma, since most of the jobs require vocational&#13;
skills which can be provided by the enterprises (Annex para 46). Agreement has been reached with&#13;
provincial labor bureaus that 50 percent of the migrants assisted under the project will have less than&#13;
complete primary school education. This will effectively target poor households. Incentives and&#13;
emphasis on local job placement for women and ethnic minorities would encourage county labor bureaus&#13;
to provide these groups with a representative share of job opportunities.&#13;
41.   The provincial offices of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) would provide women&#13;
with an orientation session on the risks of labor mobility, including sexual exploitation, crime and&#13;
enforcement of workers' legal rights. When local conditions warrant, these orientation sessions would&#13;
be offered in minority languages. In some project counties, the ACWF already facilitates women's&#13;
labor mobility to nearby towns, counties and provinces for domestic work and factory jobs.42&#13;
42.   Mashan County (Guangxi) is one of the "prototype counties" appraised by a September, 1994&#13;
Bank Group mission. Mashan County has established village committees to select, orient and mobilize&#13;
labor mobility candidates. The village committees have proposed four selection criteria to choose&#13;

candidates: (a) the number of surplus laborers in the household, (b) voluntary commitment to complete&#13;
a one-year contract, (c) the health of the laborer and (d) household acceptance of the financial obligation&#13;
involved. An orientation to the labor mobility component for all households with surplus laborers would&#13;
be part of the transparent system developed by Mashan County.&#13;
43.   Labor Market Information System  To locate the highest possible number of appropriate jobs,&#13;
a diversified job identification strategy would be developed for target counties in coordination with&#13;
provincial labor bureau officials. The bureaus would coordinate with counterparts in fast-growing&#13;
markets such as Guangdong and Beihai, as well as working with TVEs in nearby towns. Important&#13;
sources of information on employment opportunities would include labor bureau and private employment&#13;
agencies, construction contractors, private firms, joint ventures and municipal governments.&#13;
44.   The management information system would be established to link provincial and county offices&#13;
with LGPR and Provincial Labor Bureau representatives in major labor markets. This computerized&#13;
system would monitor changes in the scale of demand, skills mix and contract legal requirements.&#13;
Projected labor requirements would be collected on a regular basis from municipalities (including&#13;
Shanghai, Beihai, Nanning and Fangcheng) for public works such as construction of roads, port&#13;
facilities, low income housing, sewer systems, and potable water systems.&#13;
45.   Selection of participating factories would be based on specific criteria which emphasize safety&#13;
records and working conditions. Special care would be taken to review safety records and worker&#13;
conditions in joint ventures with less than 100 workers, since these are the enterprises with the most&#13;
frequently reported cases of worker abuse and accidents. Some types of factories with especially poor&#13;
worker safety records, such as fireworks production, would be subject to special review.&#13;
46.   Enterr rise Reimbursement for Skills Training  The project's emphasis on skills training is&#13;
consistent with the National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan. The two forms of training provided by the&#13;
component reflect the Bank Group's experiences in vocational training. The first type of training is an&#13;
orientation to urban life, including a simple aptitude test adapted to candidates with low literacy skills&#13;
(Annex 4 para 40). Labor mobility candidates would be classified into key skills categories based on&#13;
abilities, preferences and expected levels of demand. Basic skills training would be provided by the&#13;
enterprises which participate in the labor mobility system, and they would receive reimbursement for&#13;
training costs incurred during the first two months. Interviews with enterprises in Dongguan and&#13;
Qingyuan (Guangdong) and Beihai (Guangxi), and Pudong (Shanghai) reveal that a reimbursement&#13;
strategy would be the most effective means of providing rural migrants with assembly line production&#13;
and other skills. Alternative training channels such as the use of existing training centers would be&#13;
reviewed during the one-year pilot phase.&#13;
47.   Labor Market Selection There are three segments of labor markets which offer appropriate job&#13;
opportunities to the upland poor during the next five to ten years: (a) large urban centers in the Yangtze&#13;
River and Pearl River Deltas, (b) fast growing urban centers in Guangxi, and (c) TVEs in project&#13;
provinces. These would provide full-time jobs which would be relatively easy to monitor. Other&#13;
opportunities as "temporary" and "floating" workers (such as porters, construction workers, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

seasonal agricultural day labor), do not offer a cost-effective, secure solution to the need for jobs for&#13;
the upland poor, and are not pursued by LGPR or the Labor Bureaus.&#13;
48.    Labor Market Opportunities in Large Cities   Shanghai, Guangzhou and rapidly expanding&#13;
satellite industrial zones such as Dongguan and Qingyuan are promising markets for rural migrants&#13;
assisted under the project. The Municipality of Shanghai has a current immigrant population of 3.3&#13;
million and estimates an annual increase of 11.4 percent in demand for labor-intensive industries,&#13;
services (hotels, restaurants), cargo handling and trades. The Pudong (Shanghai) Labor Bureau believes&#13;
that 85,000 to 90,000 upland migrants could be absorbed from project areas over a six-year period.&#13;
Construction, textiles and other labor-intensive manufactured goods are leading the economic sectors.&#13;
The Pearl River Delta labor market (including Guangzhou) already includes more than 6 million migrant&#13;
workers and is growing at an annual rate of 8 percent. Growth industries include toys, electronics&#13;
assembly, and construction.43&#13;
49.    Guangxi Municipal Employment Development Subcomponent  The second market segment&#13;
includes three fast growing cities in Guangxi Province -- Nanning, Beihai and Fangcheng. Nanning's&#13;
diversified industrial base and relative proximity to upland counties provides a ready market for surplus&#13;
laborers. According to Beihai Municipality, industrial sectors with large annual growth rates and&#13;
significant low skilled labor demand are feed processing, beverage manufacture and raw materials&#13;
processing." Fangcheng's port development should spur growth in other areas, creating thousands&#13;
of jobs for migrants. (See Annex 5 for additional information on subcomponent activities, investments&#13;
and employment generation.)&#13;
50.    To take advantage of these markets, the project would provide a $47.5 million hard loan for&#13;
urban development and agriculture activities in Nanning, Beihai and Fangcheng. It would support&#13;
development of a "poverty reduction industrial zone" for labor-intensive industries (Beihai),&#13;
unsubsidized low cost housing (Nanning slum improvement; dormitory construction for migrant workers&#13;
in Nanning and Fangcheng), mariculture (Beihai) and fast-growing variety tree plantations (Nanning).&#13;
Over a six-year period, these projects would provide more than 19,000 full-time and 17,500 seasonal&#13;
jobs for upland surplus laborers.45  The cost per permanent job generated (Y25,000) is comparable to&#13;
the average for TVE job creation under the project. This subcomponent does not require any&#13;
resettlement or relocation activities.&#13;
51.    TVE Labor Markets The rapid growth of local TVEs is also a labor mobility opportunity for&#13;
the upland poor. TVE employment has grown from 11 percent of total employment in Guangxi in 1990&#13;
to more than 19 percent in 1993, buoyed by rapid TVE growth in coastal areas. However, TVE&#13;

Annex 5).&#13;
45/ Due to their links to other project activities and relative proximity to urban areas, the 17,500 seasonal jobs created by the Guangxi Metropolitan&#13;
Employment Development Subcomponent could be monitored effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -                                       Annex 4&#13;
workers continue to represent a relatively low share of the total workforce in Guizhou and Yunnan&#13;
(slightly more than the national TVE share of 9 percent in 1980). Investment comparisons reveal a&#13;
chronic lack of capital for TVEs in Southwest China, due in part to inadequate transportation and a&#13;
weak industrial base.   TVE fixed asset loan applications in Guizhou from  1985 to 1990 were Y710&#13;
million, but only Y260 million was financed by banks. Total TVE investment in Guizhou in 1993&#13;
amounted to Y830 million, a per capita investment of Y28.5. By comparison, TVE investment in the&#13;
Eastern region reached Y130.2 billion, equal to a per capita investment of Y395.&#13;
52.    The provincial and county TVE and labor bureaus have agreed that all low skilled jobs created&#13;
by TVE expansion or establishment which are financed by the project will be offered to migrants from&#13;
project areas. For some project counties, such as Puding County (Guizhou), this is equivalent to 60&#13;
percent of the target established for labor mobility for the six-year project. Investments supported by&#13;
the TVE component would lead to the creation of 29,500 jobs in project areas, with more than 75&#13;
percent during the first three years of the project.&#13;
53.    The TVE component would support 209 enterprises, amounting to a total investment of Y478&#13;
million. The component would support expansion or creation of 123 agroprocessing firms, 26 mining&#13;
operations, 8 companies providing services, and 4 handicrafts manufacturers in local towns.&#13;
Agroprocessing activities include silk reeling, forest products, tea, fruits and a wide range of local food&#13;
and medicinal products. The average TVE investment would be Y2.2 million, and would provide&#13;
employment for 140 upland migrants, at a cost of Y25,500 per job. Women would make up at least&#13;
80 percent of the labor force in some sectors, such as carpet weaving, embroidery and fruit processing.&#13;
54.    Job Identification: Indicative Targets    It is estimated that local TVEs would employ&#13;
approximately 25 percent of the workers, with 50 percent absorbed by TVEs and state-owned&#13;
enterprises within the province and the remaining workers placed in other provinces. The indicative&#13;
targets (presented in Table 3) are based on a six-year project which divides the labor markets by&#13;
destination and type of firm. Estimates are based on county and provincial Labor Bureau experience,&#13;
as well as labor market growth, historical demand for low skilled workers, a recent governmnit estimate&#13;
of the number of surplus laborers in project areas, and very conservative drop-out rate estimates.46&#13;
46/ Calculations in Table 3 are based on three assumptions: (a) the phasing of targets over the six year period is 8% for the first year, 12% for the second&#13;
year, and 20% for the subsequent four years, for a total of 343,000; (b) the Guangxi Subcomponent is phased in as 5,000 workers the first year, 10,000&#13;
the second year, and the remaining initial grup of 4,000 during the third year; and (c) drop-out rates are 40% by the end of the second year for each&#13;
cohort.&#13;

55.   Worker Safety Monitoring   A monitoring plan focusing on fair treatment of workers and&#13;
workplace safety has been designed by the LGPR and MOL, based on five years of provincial and&#13;
county labor bureau experiences. The LGPR, provincial labor bureaus and the ACWF would each&#13;
responsible for specific monitoring, reporting and evaluation activities. Incentives would be established&#13;
to encourage county labor bureaus to place women and ethnic minorities. The preference would be to&#13;
place more vulnerable groups with local firms, where monitoring would be the direct responsibility of&#13;
local county labor bureaus.&#13;
56.   Indicators of component effectiveness are:  (a) wage and remittance levels, (b) job safety&#13;
records, (c) dormitory conditions, (d) conditions faced by women workers, (e) resolution of labor&#13;
disputes involving migrants, (f) cost per job created, (g) handling of overtime assignments to migrant&#13;
workers, and (h) contract completion rates. The All-China Women's Federation would develop a&#13;
special monitoring system to detect cases of sexual exploitation and report them to the authorities. The&#13;
safety performance of joint ventures with less than 100 employees would be monitored with greater&#13;
frequency.&#13;
57.   When monitoring agencies detect unsafe working or living conditions, the project will ensure&#13;
that corrective actions are taken and the appropriate authorities are informed (including the Public&#13;
Security Bureau and the Ministry of Industry). In January, 1995, the MOL issued more stringent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -                                         Annex 4&#13;
regulations for worker safety and worker legal rights, with increased penalties for violations.4 These&#13;
new standards provide the legal basis for seeking remedies for unfairly treated workers and improving&#13;
working and living conditions.&#13;
58.    Financial Arrangements  The project would establish a financially sound system  for rural-to-&#13;
urban labor mobility which emphasizes cost coverage. Significant cost recovery would be achieved&#13;
through payroll deductions for workers placed in enterprises with more than 50 workers. Mechanisms&#13;
which insure the security of remittances from migrants to upland households would also be established,&#13;
possibly through a voucher system. Table 4 below presents the procedures and practices which would&#13;
be adopted to insure an acceptable level of cost recovery.&#13;
59.    Two of the most important techniques to promote significant cost coverage would be (a) the use&#13;
of groups and (b) a household and village responsibility system with credible incentives and sanctions.&#13;
Groups of 5 to 10 labor mobility candidates would be established during orientation. These self-&#13;
selecting groups would select a group leader who would be responsible for group discipline, including&#13;
on-the-job performance and timely cost recovery contributions through secure channels to the LGPR,&#13;
local Labor Bureau, or their designates.&#13;
60.    The use of peer groups is similar to the informal system  used by some enterprises to offer&#13;
recruitment fees to workers who return from Spring Festival with relatives or friends who are offered&#13;
limited training and a one-year contract. This mechanism's success is due to the chance for peers to&#13;
discuss the benefits and risks of a specific labor mobility opportunity. Groups have also been effective&#13;
as a joint liability system in several successful formal and informal group-based savings and credit&#13;
systems serving the poor throughout Asia and Latin America. The concept of migrant groups has also&#13;
been widely accepted by households with surplus laborers, village leaders, LGPR component designers&#13;
and county and provincial Labor Bureau representatives.&#13;
61.    The second cost recovery technique would be a shared responsibility system  involving the&#13;
migrant, the group, the household and the village. If migrants from a village perform poorly in terms&#13;
of work, discipline or on-time cost coverage, the village committee would be expected to take&#13;
immediate action to correct the situation. Incentives would include increased access to labor mobility&#13;
slots, while sanctions would entail temporary suspension from component participation. This approach&#13;
would build on historic practices of shared labor arrangements and mutual food security in the upland&#13;
villages. The use of groups is considered to be an effective means of preserving social cohesion and&#13;
establishing a support group for more vulnerable migrants, such as women and ethnic minorities (mainly&#13;
Miao, Buyi, Zhuang and Yi).48 In addition, villages have experience in mutual responsibility from&#13;

1.    Sufficient income to cover costs within 12 to 18 months would be a consideration in job selection.&#13;
2.    Shared responsibilitv and hinh visibility Responsibility for the loan will be given to the worker, the group,&#13;
the household, and the village committee (para 60).&#13;
3.    Rewards for strong performance Villages, townships, counties and provinces will be rewarded by the&#13;
program based on cost recovery, based on Central Labor Mobility component incentive schemes.&#13;
4.    Groups of candidates would be organized during village orientation to share responsibility for on-time&#13;
payments and for organizing remittances (para 59).&#13;
5.    A village committee responsibilitv system would be employed, including performance-based rewards and&#13;
credible sanctions. Failure to remedy the problems could result in suspension from component activities until&#13;
effective corrective actions are taken (para 60).&#13;
6.    In-kind support would be provided for services, work and residency fees by LGPR or the local Labor&#13;
Bureau. Cash provided to migrants would be limited to food and personal goods during the first two months.&#13;
7.    A Reserve Fund would be set up to cover the costs of transportation to the village of origin for those&#13;
migrants unable to adjust to the new work environment (estimated to be around 10% for the first two years,&#13;
based on provincial and county Labor Bureau experiences from 1991 to 1994.)5&#13;
8.    Payroll deduction systems would be used under appropriate conditions.&#13;
9.    Secure remittance channels would be developed by the joint entity (possibly based on a voucher system) to&#13;
insure that households receive the full amount sent.&#13;
10.   Careful control through computerized records would allow county Labor Bureaus to notify village committees&#13;
of upcoming payments.&#13;
62.    The net financial gains for the upland household would be a key indicator of component success.&#13;
The estimated financial rate of return, using very conservative figures, is 91 percent due largely to the&#13;
existing wage rate differentials for rural and urban low skilled jobs, and could easily cover costs within&#13;
12 to 18 months (Annex 12). The component's monitoring system would detect cases in which cost&#13;
recovery mechanisms cause undue hardship on upland households. A pilot phase evaluation would&#13;

project's central Labor Mobility component fund of Y1 11 million, including a Y15 million grant from&#13;
the  State  Council.   Its responsibilities would  be (a) to  establish  a job  placement system  for&#13;
interprovincial labor mobility, including (i) labor market analysis outside the project provinces and (ii)&#13;
51! Figures in the Table 5 are based on the following: (a) training fee covers a 10-day orientation (cases of 50) and a special orientadon for interprovisl&#13;
migrants; (b) interprovincial transportation is based on the cost of a roundtrip train ticket (hard seat) from Guiyang to Shanghai; (c) registration fees include&#13;
the family planning card, identification card, temporary residential card, temporary worker permit, and provincial border card; (d) accommodations are&#13;
for two months during and after placement; (e) work and residency permits are included in the registraton fee; (f) settling-in allowance covers food expenses&#13;
for two months; (g) reserve fund is based on a drop-out rate of 9%.&#13;

a computerized dissemination system to provide timely information to project counties and provinces,&#13;
and (b) to provide training on operations, reporting and procedures to county labor bureau staff. A&#13;
consultative body would be established, consisting of representatives of the ACWF, the Public Security&#13;
Bureau and the Ministries of Construction and Industry. The new joint entity has been designed to&#13;
minimize bureaucratic tendencies and avoid high fees which are prevalent in some existing institutional&#13;
labor mobility channels. It would also overcome traditional biases against more remote counties,&#13;
women and ethnic minorities, and develop effective safeguards.&#13;
64.   To accomplish these objectives, the joint entity would be responsible for seven activities. The&#13;
first would be to provide training and technical assistance to county and provincial Labor Bureau&#13;
personnel in aptitude testing, financial management, market development and counseling (with special&#13;
attention to the needs of women and ethnic minorities from orientation through placement). Specific&#13;
skills required include management of information systems (for market demand, surplus labor statistics&#13;
and skills inventories), curriculum development, trainee certification, marketing and labor dispute&#13;
resolution. Both pre-job training for new staff and periodic activities to upgrade and broaden the skills&#13;
of existing staff members would be provided. Other activities would include:&#13;
*     Seminars and exchanges between county and provincial labor bureau staff would be organized.&#13;
The joint entity would also participate in seminars on MOL and MOA labor mobility&#13;
experimental projects underway throughout the country, sponsored in part by the Ford&#13;
Foundation.52&#13;
*     Monitoring systems for worker safety and dormitory conditions would be developed. The joint&#13;
entity would coordinate these activities with local ACWF offices.&#13;
*     Secure remittance channels would be developed and tested by the joint entity, sharing results&#13;
with county and provincial Labor Bureaus.&#13;
*     Evaluation of the one-year pilot phase would be coordinated by the joint entity, enabling village&#13;
leaders, county and provincial Labor Bureau staff and outside experts to participate in the&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
*     Management and Financial Audits would be arranged by the joint entity, to insure that effective&#13;
management systems are in place at the county, provincial and central levels.&#13;
*     Labor Mobility Policy and Regulatory Framework Recommendations would be reviewed by the&#13;
joint entity, as part of the evaluation activities, and a report would be issued to LGPR, MOL&#13;
and the Bank Group.&#13;
65.   Progress in Institutional Development In August, 1994, the LGPR took four steps which&#13;
demonstrate a strong commitment to the Labor Mobility component, including: (a) establishment of&#13;

a Labor Mobility Division staffed with one professional and two assistants, (b) allocation of Y1 11&#13;
million from central project funds to support component activities, (c) negotiation of a Y15 million State&#13;
Council grant for the labor mobility component, and (d) discussions with the Municipality of Shanghai&#13;
concerning contracts for low skilled workers. The LGPR and the Bank Group also completed the first&#13;
phase of a labor market demand study, focusing on job opportunities for low skilled upland laborers in&#13;
Shanghai and Guangzhou.&#13;
66.    Pilot Phase  Preparations by LGPR, MOL and the Bank Group have set the stage for a one-year&#13;
pilot phase which would allow for experimentation before large scale operations are undertaken. The&#13;
project would evaluate the following innovative elements of the labor mobility system during the pilot&#13;
phase: (i) the use of groups for mobilization, orientation and monitoring; (ii) alternative remittance&#13;
channels, (iii) the potential for cost recovery through payroll deductions, (iv) monitoring systems for&#13;
the factory, dormitory and upland village, (v) legal remedies for worker safety and rights violations,&#13;
and (vi) the effectiveness of staff training, technical assistance and networking activities.&#13;
67.    The pilot phase would also permit the project to incorporate findings from  labor mobility&#13;
research supported by the MOL and the Ford Foundation. Since there are 556 low income counties&#13;
outside the project areas which could benefit from project experiences, the pilot phase will be carefully&#13;
documented.53 In addition, pilot activities have been supported by retroactive financing since January,&#13;
1995, providing early experiences upon which to base component design adjustments.&#13;
68.    Village level monitoring during the pilot phase is critical for three reasons: (i) the effectiveness&#13;
of targeting poor households with the most surplus laborers, (ii) detection of any unexpected seasonal&#13;
labor shortages, and (iii) the increasing incidence of kidnapping young women for forced marriage,&#13;
disguised as an informal labor mobility program. "Abductions" were frequently cited in interviews with&#13;
ethnic minority households.'&#13;
69.    Risks  There are six risks associated with assisting surplus laborers from upland counties to&#13;
enter large urban markets: (a) difficulties with monitoring worker safety and living conditions, (b)&#13;
challenges in the face of dynamic market demand, (c) problems with migrant worker adjustment to&#13;
urban life and factory work, (d) increased urban unemployment from failing state-owned enterprises,&#13;
(e) potential new controls on labor mobility, and (f) macroeconomic risks such as inflation and controls&#13;
on foreign investment.&#13;
70.    The possibility of large scale layoffs of state-owned enterprise employees could affect major&#13;
urban markets. State-owned enterprises employ 103 million people and suffer losses of Y30 billion to&#13;
Y50 billion annually.55 The government recently decided to implement economic and financial&#13;

stabilization policies for state-owned enterprises in the largest 18 cities to update technologies, remove&#13;
excessive social burdens and provide development funds to minimize urban unemployment risks.&#13;
71.   Ongoing collaboration between LGPR, MOL and the Bank Group have identified and responded&#13;
to these risks. Monitoring systems (Annex 4, para 55-57) and the computerized market information&#13;
management system (Annex 4, para 44) address the first two risks. Orientation sessions by the LGPR,&#13;
county labor bureau and the ACWF respond to the third concern (Annex 4, para 41). The joint entity's&#13;
consultative body (Annex 4, para 63) and policy orientation (Annex 4, para 64) address the other risks.&#13;
72.   The LGPR, MOL and Bank Group recognize that this innovative component faces higher than&#13;
normal risks due to the high level of vulnerability of the clients and the nature of labor mobility&#13;
activities in a changing economic and legal setting -- and the component has been designed to minimize&#13;
these risks to the greatest possible degree. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) labor&#13;
mobility would be undertaken only on a strictly voluntary basis, and (b) an adequate monitoring and&#13;
reporting system, focusing on fair treatment of workers and workplace safety, would be designed and&#13;
implemented.&#13;
Integration with Other ComDonents&#13;
73.   Labor Mobility component activities would be integrated with other project components both&#13;
directly and indirectly. Direct links with enterprises supported under the TVE component have already&#13;
been developed (See Annex 4, para 53 for detailed information). The Rural Infrastructure component&#13;
would identify a large number of potential labor migrants, based on performance in component&#13;
activities. Since household interviews revealed that remittances are often used for health care expenses&#13;
and school fees, the Social Services component would be supported by labor mobility. Finally,&#13;
information from the Poverty Monitoring component would provide a means of confirming village level&#13;
effects of labor mobility.&#13;

China&#13;
Southwest China Povertv Reduction Project&#13;
Guangxi Municipal Employment Development Subcomponent&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Rural-Urban Migration A key element of China's strategy to alleviate absolute poverty&#13;
among southwest China's upland communities is to develop their labor exports in order to&#13;
generate remittances and relieve population pressures in the poor households. A labor market&#13;
for migrant workers has already emerged, with millions employed in China's major centers of&#13;
economic growth such as Guangdong and the Yangtze Delta. Migrants, male and female, are&#13;
employed mainly in labor intensive sectors such as construction, stevedoring and light industry.&#13;
In the established formal markets, local labor bureaus intervene to regulate the flow and monitor&#13;
working conditions but the majority of migrants (some 80 percent) venture out informally,&#13;
sometimes with families. After decades of strict controls many coastal cities are now actively&#13;
encouraging immigration. The surge in growth caused by China's adoption of a market based&#13;
economy is generating millions of jobs that cannot be filled by city labor forces constrained by&#13;
urban family planning controls and underproductive due to lifelong habits of restrictive labor&#13;
practices and soft budget constraints in state owned enterprises.&#13;
2.    Populous provinces like Sichuan have long-established access to the coastal province labor&#13;
markets but, for reasons due mainly to remoteness, Guangxi and its poor neighbors account for&#13;
only two percent of migrants in the Shanghai market for example. Such markets seek supplies&#13;
of educated, capable labor provided through reliable mechanisms. Guangxi labor lacks the links&#13;
to major areas of demand, even within province, partly due to a relatively undeveloped labor&#13;
bureau intermediary role. The project would help establish an intermediary mechanism for both&#13;
interprovincial and intraprovincial movement for workers from Guangxi's poor areas and from&#13;
twelve targeted poor counties in particular.&#13;
3.    China's cities in general are just beginning to face the prospect of major population&#13;
fluctuations. Their strictly planned urban settlements make little provision for unregistered&#13;
residents "outside the plan". In wealthier cities the employing enterprises provide simple&#13;
dormitory accommodation and basic services including canteens to migrant workers.&#13;
Construction contractors -- often successful bidders from other cities -- move in their teams en-&#13;
bloc and set up camps on site for their workers. In less wealthy cities such as Nanning, capital&#13;
of Guangxi Province, many industries can not provide accommodation and migrants are left to&#13;
their own initiatives - renting space where available, lodging with relatives or compatriots,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

setting up squatter settlements, and -- in the semi-tropical conditions of the region -- even&#13;
sleeping on the streets.&#13;
Guan,exi Urban Development&#13;
4.          China's local government managers bear much of the brunt of economic reform's&#13;
practical consequences. Recent fiscal reforms have reduced the share of tax revenue retained&#13;
by local governments, exacerbating the tax base weaknesses of less developed cities. Price&#13;
controls on public services and utilities constrain revenues and the ability to expand services.&#13;
At the same time the separation of government and industry (and the separation of taxes and&#13;
profits) is increasingly reducing local governments' former control over investment decision&#13;
making, yet attraction of new industry and external investment is crucial to growth. Guangxi's&#13;
attraction is based on typical local tax exemption incentives but which, together with low wage&#13;
rates and good transport services, appeal to relocating or expanding enterprises anticipating a&#13;
boom in the development of the southwestern region. These conditions are also attractive to&#13;
enterprises no longer competitive in higher cost areas such as Guangzhou and Shanghai.&#13;
5.    Growth has come late to Guangxi Province, western neighbor to burgeoning Guangdong&#13;
and the home, in its mountainous region, to many of China's absolute poor. Guangxi's economy&#13;
was declared open only in 1992 but the province is losing no time in pursuing its natural&#13;
advantages -- in particular its position as the head of the transport corridor serving the entire&#13;
southwest region, including Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, known as the "Great Southwest".&#13;
Like the established economic centers elsewhere, Guangxi's nascent industrial sectors also&#13;
require migrant labor, but the absence of formal markets in context of financially weak local&#13;
government is leading to informal squatter settlements and social welfare concerns.&#13;
6.    Housing in Guangxi's cities has typically been the responsibility of enterprises under the&#13;
direction of the housing bureau. As a key element of enterprise reform in China, housing and&#13;
social security responsibilities are to be transferred to the public sector and various ad hoc&#13;
arrangements have emerged to finance such undertakings. Most housing programs continue to&#13;
be subsidized and are severely limited by the shortage of local government finance. Formal&#13;
housing availability in Guangxi's cities is below the national average for similar sized cities of&#13;
equivalent rank.&#13;
7.    Migration within Guangxi therefore faces the problems of finding jobs and&#13;
accommodation, and avoiding becoming a burden on strained city services and welfare systems.&#13;
The Guangxi municipal employment development subcomponent aims to minimize the risks&#13;
associated with these problems in experimental efforts to provide jobs and accommodation&#13;
without creating additional burdens for the municipalities concerned.  The participating&#13;
municipalities of Beihai, Fangcheng and Nanning (the provincial capital) account for over 40&#13;
percent of Guangxi's GDP and offer good prospects for new jobs and sustained employment.&#13;
Details of the respective municipal economies are given in Attachment 1 which illustrates key&#13;

differences among them. In particular, Nanning has a broad industrial base, growing quickly&#13;
but a low wage structure and a severe housing shortage. Fangcheng is the location of the major&#13;
seaport serving the Great Southwest and is expected to grow rapidly but, with a small tax base&#13;
and many competing investment needs, has little to spare for housing. Beihai, long known as&#13;
a resort area and also a port, recently has been the focus of much speculation in real estate&#13;
development and is now attempting to diversify its economy into light industry.&#13;
Subcomponent Description&#13;
8.    Subcomponent Objectives   The objectives of the Guangxi Municipal Employment&#13;
Development (GX-MEDS) subcomponent are to: (a) create secure job opportunities in the&#13;
municipalities of Beihai, Fangcheng and Nanning for migrant workers from Guangxi's poor&#13;
upland areas, and (b) demonstrate low-income housing options for single migrant workers. The&#13;
three municipalities expect to absorb some 350,000 migrant workers over the next five years,&#13;
mainly through informal channels. SWPRP's Labor Mobility Component would attempt to bring&#13;
about 20 percent of the migrants within an organized labor mobility system serving twelve&#13;
targeted upland poverty counties (more fully described in Annex 4). In support of this effort,&#13;
the municipalities have committed to offer incentives to new enterprises willing to employ the&#13;
workers from this source.  At the same time they require help to develop employment&#13;
opportunities and accommodation facilities for migrants. In Beihai the project would support&#13;
job creation initiatives in urban and rural enterprises. In Fangcheng and Nanning (the provincial&#13;
capital) the project would support low income rental housing development for single workers as&#13;
well as job creation in rural enterprises. The eight subprojects and their expected employment&#13;
impacts are summarized in Table 1 below. A small technical assistance and training fund would&#13;
be held by the Guangxi Project Management Office for financing of key technical assistance and&#13;
training needs of the project enterprises.&#13;
Estimated Subcomponent Cost Summary and Financing Plan&#13;
9.    The subcomponent is estimated to cost in total about Y751.4 million (US$ 85 million&#13;
equivalent), including land, and physical and price contingencies (see Table 2 below for cost&#13;
summary). Base costs are estimated in December 1994 prices. Physical contingencies average&#13;
6,5 percent of the base cost. Price contingencies, averaging 19.5 percent, have been calculated&#13;
for both foreign and local costs using Bank estimated escalation factors/'.&#13;

originating mainly from the project counties.&#13;
/c       Low income housing projects not aimed at direct employment generation but would provide 36,500 living spaces for migrant workers,&#13;
70 percent of which would be from project counties (Nanning 29,000 and Fangcbeng 17,500). Rural and urban enterprises supported&#13;
by the subcomponent would provide dormitories for their permanent workers (about 15,000 spaces) and camps for seasonal workers.&#13;
10.      The Bank would finance 55 percent of the estimated total project costs (excluding taxes&#13;
and interest during construction) of Y740 million (US$85 million equivalent) on standard IBRD&#13;
terms. Assurances were provided at negotiations that (a) the Government would onlend the&#13;
proceeds of the IBRD loan to Beihai, Fangcheng and Nanning municipalities on terms&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank Group, and (b) the municipalities would onlend the proceeds to the&#13;
project enterprises on terms at least equivalent to the current comparable terms available from&#13;
the Agricultural Bank of China. Local counterpart funds would be provided by the participating&#13;
enterprise (33 percent), and other sources including local government budget (12 percent). The&#13;
loan proceeds would be allocated approximately as follows:&#13;

11.   Disbursements of the loan would cover:&#13;
a.    55 percent of total expenditures for civil works (including force account);&#13;
b.    100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment, goods,&#13;
materials and breeding stock or 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for&#13;
locally manufactured equipment, goods, materials and breeding stock, and 75&#13;
percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and&#13;
C.    100 percent of expenditures for consulting services and staff training.&#13;
12.   Disbursement would be made against priced contracts for the works, materials and&#13;
equipment, and against actual costs of travel and subsistence, tuition and training fees for staff&#13;
training in China or abroad (Annex 5, para 65 for procurement details). Reimbursements for&#13;
expenditures for goods and civil works not exceeding US$200,000 and US$2,000,000&#13;
respectively, would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE) subject to the terms&#13;
established for SWPRP (SAR para 3.51). To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account would&#13;
be opened for the purposes of GX-MEDS with an initial deposit of US$3 million, the estimated&#13;
average expenditure for a four-month period.&#13;
13.   Accounts and Audits. Records of all project expenditures would be maintained by the&#13;
project management office (PMO) in participating units and forwarded to the Provincial PMO&#13;
for incorporation into consolidated project accounts, which would be audited annually by the&#13;
State Audit Administration (SAR para 3.56). The audited accounts would also include details&#13;
of withdrawals from the Special Account made on the basis of SOEs, and the auditors opinion&#13;
as to whether such withdrawals were against expenditures eligible for reimbursement by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;

14.     Five sectoral initiatives would be supported under GX-MEDS.  Following are detailed&#13;
descriptions of each initiative covering the objectives, content, estimated costs, and financing&#13;
and implementation arrangements as well as expected benefits and environmental impact.&#13;
Poverty Reduction Enterprise Zone (Beihai)&#13;
15.     Objectives. The objectives of the Beihai poverty reduction enterprise zone (BPREZ) are&#13;
to create stable employment for migrant workers from the target poverty group, and to provide&#13;
incentives to small and medium sized, labor intensive enterprises to locate their permanent&#13;
operations in Beihai. The 10 ha zone would provide a variety of rental and purchase options&#13;
in the form of serviced land or factory building space together with worker dormitory space to&#13;
small and  medium   sized  enterprises  wishing  to  locate  operations  in  Beihai.   Enterprises&#13;
specializing in non-polluting, light industrial manufacturing using labor intensive processes would&#13;
be targeted.&#13;
16.     A total of some 40 firms employing about 8,000 permanent workers in total are expected&#13;
to locate in BPREZ. Ten firms ranging from garment manufacturing to food processing and&#13;
component manufacturing had expressed potential interest at time of appraisal. Beihai has&#13;
become in recent times the destination of a number of investors anticipating opportunities in the&#13;
economic growth stemming from the development of the Southwest China Region. It has the&#13;
second largest seaport facilities in Guangxi (after Fangcheng) with some 2 million tons of annual&#13;
general cargo capacity. Fixed asset investment in Beihai in 1993/94 was Y1.36 billion, and&#13;
construction and enterprises employed an estimated 530,000 migrant laborers in 1993 (in contrast&#13;
to the registered municipal population of 1.3 million).&#13;
17.     Subproiect Description.  A  marketing study is underway that will help attract suitable&#13;
firms and optimize BPREZ investment plans. The marketing strategy would generally follow&#13;
the experience of the Qingyuan (Guangdong) Experimental Economic Zone/2. The physical&#13;
assets of the Zone Authority would be established on a 10.6 ha serviced area contiguous with&#13;
other land in a 6 km2 area zoned for light industry and mixed use purposes located in the Gaode&#13;
District about five kilometers from the municipal CBD. Power, telecommunications and water&#13;
supplies, and drainage, sewerage and garbage services are already available off site. Based on&#13;
/2     The "Qingyuan Experimental Economic Zone for Supporting the Poverty Stricken Areas' is a development by Qingyuan&#13;
Municipality located about 58 km north of Guangzhou, adjoining the N107 National Road. A first phase 9.6 km' area has been developed&#13;
by the municipality since 1992 in cooperation with poor counties in upland Guangdong and elsewhere. Land in the fully serviced zone is&#13;
leased to light industrial and service sector enterprises. The zone provides cheap land (currently Y230 per m2) and access to low cost,&#13;
productive labor. At full scale (18.6 km') about 2000 enterprises are anticipated in total which would provide about 200,000 jobs for a total&#13;
investment esimated at Y15 bilion (i.e. Y75,000 per job). The zone allows poorer coundes access to well located industrial sites which&#13;
can be developed with foreign and local joint venture partners. Profits and taxes generted by such enterprises are allocated to the poor&#13;
counties concerned according to their equity holdings. In addidon the labor used by the enterprises by agreement must be drawn from the&#13;
labor pools of the poor counties. Currently some 100 enterprises have been established or have begun development to date. The established&#13;
enterprises reportedly employ about 6,000 workers of which one half are migrants although many are from outside Guangdong Province.&#13;
Participating enterprises enjoy up to 10 years of graduated local (income) tax exemptions and enterprises hiring migrant labor enjoy a&#13;
discount on their land lease purchase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -                                Annex 5&#13;
preliminary demand estimates, site development would include construction on about 5.6 ha of&#13;
up to 48,000 m2 of floor space in standard multi-story factory and warehouse buildings, together&#13;
with 21,000 m2 dormitory accommodation for workers and staff. About one half of the floor&#13;
space is expected to be rented by smaller firms, while the remainder is expected to be sold to&#13;
small-medium sized firms requiring customized space. Assurances were given at negotiations&#13;
that Beihai Municipality would undertake a program of site and building sales and leases for&#13;
BPREZ satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
18.   Estimated Costs and Financing. The BPREZ project is estimated to cost about Y1 16&#13;
million (US$ 13.2 million equivalent), including land, and physical and price contingencies.&#13;
Base costs are estimated in Dec. 1994 prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at ten&#13;
percent of the base cost. Price contingencies have been calculated for both foreign and local&#13;
costs using Bank estimated escalation factors (Annex 5, para 9). The Bank Group would finance&#13;
55 percent of the estimated total subproject costs.&#13;
19.  Implementation Arrangements. The project would be implemented and operated by the&#13;
BPREZ Management Committee, an autonomous enterprise owned jointly by national, provincial&#13;
and municipal government-owned entities (Annex 5, para 62). The BPREZ Management&#13;
Committee would include five departments responsible for engineering, leasing, property&#13;
management, administration, finance and accounting, and labor management. Supplies and&#13;
services for construction of the BPREZ assets and facilities would be procured through local&#13;
competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group. Assurances were given at&#13;
negotiations that disbursements against expenditures for buildings that would be rented or sold&#13;
under the BPREZ project would be on condition that acceptable pre-lease or pre-sale&#13;
agreements, as appropriate, have been concluded with respect to at least 50 percent of thefloor&#13;
space of the building concerned.&#13;
20.   EmDloyment. Enterprises in BPREZ would be required to employ workers from poverty&#13;
stricken regions and Guangxi target poverty counties in particular. The migrant workers would&#13;
chiefly fill laboring and semiskilled positions. Management, technical and skilled workers would&#13;
be recruited freely by the enterprises. The ratio of acceptance of migrant workers to the&#13;
workforce will directly affect the preferential treatment enjoyed by the enterprises. About 70&#13;
percent of the anticipated 8,000 person workforce employed in BPREZ is expected to be&#13;
migrants from poor areas. Workers would be organized and provided through the local Labor&#13;
Bureau intermediation system supported by SWPRP (See Annex 4 for labor mobility system).&#13;
Accommodation would be available for migrant workers in dormitories on site owned or leased&#13;
by the enterprises. Dormitory standards would be equivalent to the low income housing&#13;
standards established under the Guangxi subcomponent (Annex 5, para 26).&#13;

Total       8L000               100.0&#13;
22.   Environmental Impact. Beihai Municipality is fully conscious of the vulnerability of the&#13;
municipal area to environmental pollution and has completed a comprehensive environmental&#13;
impact assessment of the various proposed subprojects. The Beihai coastal area (comprising&#13;
some 128,000 kmi) is now relatively unpolluted and particularly rich in marine resources&#13;
(including unique shellfish species and pearl culture). Beihai is also a popular beach resort and&#13;
conference center. Air quality is very good and extensive groundwater resources are available.&#13;
Although one of China's 14 designated "open coastal cities", industrial output forms a minor&#13;
share of Beihai's GDP which is largely based on agriculture and fisheries, and in recent years,&#13;
residential real estate development. A small concentration of heavy industry is located close to&#13;
the port area about 20 km from the city proper, and oil and gas development is occurring about&#13;
20 nautical miles offshore. A light industry zone has been established in Gaode District (site&#13;
of BPREZ) on vacant, marginal agricultural land. No resettlement of existing tenants is required&#13;
for BPREZ. Other concentrations of light industry are developing in various townships of the&#13;
municipality's rural hinterland. In the recently developed urban area a separate sewerage&#13;
network has been installed and a treatment facility is planned for implementation and operation&#13;
prior to 2000. New enterprises must file an environmental impact assessment and undertake&#13;
mitigating measures as part of the investment in order to comply with stipulated discharge&#13;
standards.&#13;
23.   Enterprises locating in BPREZ are intended mainly to be non-polluting light industries&#13;
and would be required to conform to established discharge standards. Waste discharges from&#13;
BPREZ would be passed following on-site primary treatment to the municipal collection systems&#13;
for disposal. Waste water (containing chiefly organic wastes) is currently discharged through&#13;
an outlet to the sea, and solid waste is stored at the municipal dump.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -                                  Annex 5&#13;
Low-income Housing (Fangcheng and Nanning)&#13;
24.   Objectives. The objective of the low income housing component is to provide affordable&#13;
accommodation to single migrant workers without public subsidy. Urban housing is generally&#13;
in short supply in the Guangxi project cities which were granted open economic status only in&#13;
1992. The past generally low level of economic activity in Guangxi is reflected in the low level&#13;
of infrastructure and housing in its cities/3. Current housing was developed under past economic&#13;
plans by the city enterprises coordinated by the municipal housing bureau. Housing demands&#13;
outside the plan stemming from migrant workers could not be met and the project cities are&#13;
marked by extensive informal squatter settlements consisting of makeshift housing and unpaved&#13;
access. Older settlements have access to municipal services but newer settlements have none.&#13;
25.   Subproject Description. The past restrictions on migrant labor movement have been&#13;
lifted and cities are free to determine their own strategies to accommodate migrants. The&#13;
Guangxi municipal govermnents recognize the importance of migrant labor inputs to their city's&#13;
growing economic activity and competitiveness, and have adopted an open policy. The three&#13;
project cities anticipate the arrival of some 350,000 migrants over the next five years, mostly&#13;
seeking employment speculatively. Among these arrivals would be about 50,000 migrants&#13;
sponsored by the project under the Labor Bureau's administration. Some arrivals would be&#13;
accommodated in enterprise dormitories; the remainder would seek accommodation from the&#13;
market. In view of the constrained market and in order not to worsen housing conditions due&#13;
to demands by the sponsored migrants, low income housing settlement enterprises would be&#13;
established by both Nanning and Fangcheng Municipalities/4.&#13;
26.   The Nanning project would provide accommodation on a vacant 4.3 ha site in the Beihu&#13;
District for 29,000 migrant workers (male and female), and the Fangcheng project would&#13;
provide for 17,500 on 3.3 ha of vacant reclaimed land close to downtown. The sites are close&#13;
to arterial roads and public transport services. The settlements, intended to serve single migrants&#13;
without families, would be based on typical dormitory style accommodation with shared rooms,&#13;
toilet and kitchen facilities arranged in seven or eight story, fully serviced and furnished blocks.&#13;
Agreed site and building planning standards are shown in Table 3 below. The dormitory spaces&#13;
would be rented to migrants with preference given to workers from the target poverty groups.&#13;
In anticipation of the migrant population profile changing from single to family status, half of&#13;
the blocks would be convertible to apartment style accommodation in due course. Dormitory&#13;
standards would be maintained for at least ten years. Assurances were given at negotiations that&#13;
the low-income housing provided under the project would be: (a) planned and constructed&#13;
/3   In 1992 Nanning was recorded as providing 5.7 m2 residential living space per person - the second lowest (after Chongqing) among&#13;
all provincial capital cities.&#13;
Housing availability is not a major issue in Beihai due to a real estate development boom in recent years.&#13;

according to criteria satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) exclusively rented for a period not less&#13;
than 10 years following completion to migrant workers from poor areas, of which not less than&#13;
70 percent would be workers from the project counties in Guangxi.&#13;

- 127 -                                Annex 5&#13;
27.       Estimated Costs and Financing. The Nanning low income housing sub-project is&#13;
estimated to cost about Y82 million (US$ 9.4 million equivalent), including land, and physical&#13;
and price contingencies (see Annex 9 for cost details). The Fangcheng project is estimated to&#13;
cost about Y53 million (US$6 million equivalent). Base costs are estimated in December 1994&#13;
prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at ten percent of the base cost. Price contingencies&#13;
have been calculated for both foreign and local costs using Bank estimated escalation factors&#13;
(Annex 5, para 9). The Bank Group would finance 55 percent of the estimated total subproject&#13;
costs.&#13;
28.       Implementation Arrangements. In Nanning the project would be implemented by&#13;
the Low Income Housing Development Administration Co. (LIHDAC), an autonomous&#13;
enterprise owned jointly by provincial and municipal government-owned entities (Annex 5, para&#13;
60). The LIHDAC would include four departments responsible for engineering, administration,&#13;
finance and accounting. On completion of construction, the assets would be managed by another&#13;
autonomous enterprise, the Enterprise Management Co., an experienced municipal property&#13;
management company.  This company would include departments for leasing/rentals,&#13;
building/site maintenance, and accounting.&#13;
29.       In Fangcheng, the project would be operated by the Fangcheng Housing&#13;
Management Co. (FHMC), an autonomous enterprise owned jointly by provincial and municipal&#13;
government-owned entities (Annex 5, para 60). The FHMC would include five departments&#13;
responsible for engineering, administration, leasing and renting, building and site maintenance,&#13;
finance and accounting.&#13;
30.       Supplies and services for construction of the housing assets and facilities would be&#13;
procured through local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
31.       Benefits. Rents would be set at affordable levels (approximately 10 percent of&#13;
disposable income) for different standards of accommodation, intended to achieve on average&#13;
full cost recovery based on the so-called "eight factors" (including annual depreciation, repairs,&#13;
management, interest, estate and land use taxes, insurance, and a modest profit). Income&#13;
surpluses are expected to be sufficient to cover 40 percent of the investment cost of a similar&#13;
future development. Residents would be directly responsible for utility consumption charges and&#13;
service fees.&#13;
32.       Rental of living spaces would be the chief monitoring indicator for the low income&#13;
housing subprojects in accordance with the following agreed targets:&#13;

33.   Environmental Impact. The low income housing settlements would be established on&#13;
vacant land and do not require any resettlement of existing tenants. The settlements would&#13;
indirectly support development of light industry in Nanning and to a small extent in Fangcheng&#13;
(most new jobs in Fangcheng would be associated with stevedoring services at the port), and&#13;
would avoid increasing the extent of insanitary informal squatter settlements. Both sites have&#13;
direct access to a full range of off-site services including municipal waste management services.&#13;
Municipal wastewater is currently discharged following primary treatment to the sea in the case&#13;
of Fangcheng, and to natural waterways and eventually the Xijiang River (a major navigable&#13;
waterway) in the case of Nanning. In each city garbage is collected by the municipality and&#13;
disposed of by open dumping at various municipal dumps. While these simple disposal&#13;
arrangements have not caused serious environmental problems to date, both cities have longer&#13;
term plans to improve disposal of municipal wastes (especially Fangcheng which adjoins a near-&#13;
pristine coastal zone, rich in marine life). Industries are required to conform to discharge&#13;
standards set and monitored by the respective municipal environmental protection bureaus.&#13;
Aguaculture (Beihai and Fangchen2)&#13;
34.   Objectives. The objectives of the proposed aquaculture enterprises in Beihai and&#13;
Fangcheng are to create stable employment for migrant workers from the target poverty group,&#13;
and to develop and expand the existing local aquaculture industry. The northern seaboard of&#13;
Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) with its protected coastal wetlands and mangroves is rich in marine&#13;
resources. Its extensive, shallow tidal flats and estuaries (244 ki2), low tidal range (2.2 m&#13;
average), unpolluted water quality and moderate climate (23 ave.) are ideally suited to marine&#13;
microorganism and large organism production including various economic species of fish,&#13;
prawn, crab and cephalopod. Along with the general improvements in living standards in China&#13;
demand for sea food is rising in the face of a limited supply, exacerbated in part by the failure&#13;
of the northern shrimp production industry due to disease. Good rail and air transport links&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                                        Annex 5&#13;
allow Guangxi's fisheries to serve distant and foreign markets with live and frozen produce.&#13;
Cold storage and ice making facilities are in place in both municipalities. Beihai aquaculture&#13;
subprojects will create 4,267 permanent and 385 temporary jobs. Fangcheng aquaculture&#13;
subprojects will employ 1,800 full-time workers and provide 495 temporary jobs.&#13;
35.    Fisheries and mariculture production totalling over 300,000 tons in 1993 contributed&#13;
about 50 percent of gross agricultural output value in Beihai and 25 percent in Fangcheng.&#13;
Annual inshore and deep sea capture fisheries production in 1993, although declining, totalled&#13;
about 240,000 tons in Beihai and 30,000 tons in Fangcheng. In contrast to capture fishing,&#13;
mariculture has expanded in Fangcheng and Beihai from less than 600 ha in 1985 to 11,000 ha&#13;
in 1993 with a combined production of about 36,000 tons/5. The area is also particularly suited&#13;
to pearl culture, producing a total of 4,434 kg in 1993 (about 5-10 percent of current total World&#13;
production). Mariculture currently occupies less than ten percent of the available tidal flat area.&#13;
36.    Subproject Description.   The ten aquaculture subprojects that would be supported by&#13;
the project include:&#13;
(a) in Beihai, (i) about 135 ha of freshwater (macrobrachium) shrimp production ponds&#13;
in Dangjiang Township; (ii) about 71 ha of marine pearl culture beds at Zhongtang and&#13;
Yingpan farms; (iii) about 600 ha of oyster production fields in Xichang Township; (iv)&#13;
about 1,332 ha of hard clam culture beds in Dangjiang and Shagang Townships; (v)&#13;
about 175 ha of marine (penaeid) shrimp ponds in Xichang; and (vi) breeding centers for&#13;
aquaculture and fish fry in an extension to the existing Xiantian Township hatchery and&#13;
in a new branch hatchery at Guangtouling; and&#13;
(b) in Fangcheng, (i) about 150 ha of scallop fields in Jiangshan township; (ii) about 720&#13;
netcages for fish culture at Guangpo Township; (iii) about 100 ha of shrimp/fish rotation&#13;
culture ponds at Gongce Township; and (iv) about 36 ha of marine pearl culture beds at&#13;
Jiangshan Township.&#13;
37.    Although mariculture is well established in the region, the proposed expansion and&#13;
diversification of aquaculture activities present some technical challenges and risks to the&#13;
enterprises which, however, are expected to diminish with experience. Freshwater shrimp&#13;
cultivation, for example, has been experimental in Guangxi to date and full scale operation&#13;
requires close supervision and continuous cropping  of market-sized  shrimps due to the&#13;
cannibalistic nature of this species. About 400 tons per year are expected at full production.&#13;
/5    The chief products include: Shellfish (Dosinia Sp., Telilinides Sp., Meretrix meretrx, Scarphaca subcrenata, Tegillarca granosa,&#13;
Ostreidac Sp., Pinctada mantens); Prawns and crabs (Penacus Penicliatus, P. merguiensis, P. monodon, P. japonicus, Metapenacus afJinis, P.&#13;
chinensis, Scylla sarrate, Portunus trituberculatus &amp; Portunus pelagicus); Marine fishes (Latrolabrax japonicus, Pagrosomus major, Sparus&#13;
macrocephalus, Lates houtuyn, L. calcarifer, Bosrichrhys sinensis, Mugil se-iug Basilewsky &amp; Periophihalmus cantonensis)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -                                Annex 5&#13;
The shrimp ponds would be constructed by converting former low value rice paddies. Pearl&#13;
cultivation using Chinese techniques has been a traditional industry in Guangxi for many&#13;
decades, interrupted only by the Cultural Revolution. The proposed subproject would nearly&#13;
double existing production to 6-7 tons per year at full output (after five years development)&#13;
thereby helping fill a serious gap in World production since the recent decline of the dominant&#13;
Japanese industry (due in part to pollution). Marine shrimp production has been established for&#13;
about 15 years in Guangxi but is at high risk of diseases that have stricken northern China and&#13;
Taiwan. Ponds would be constructed in the intertidal zone protected by an existing sea dike.&#13;
Alternate cropping of different species in rotation (in Beihai ponds) and shrimp/fish rotation (in&#13;
Fangcheng ponds) would be practiced, as well as regulated feeding and pond maintenance&#13;
(including mud sterilization), in the hope of avoiding persistent pathogenic organisms. High&#13;
intensity production techniques are expected to yield 3,000 kg/ha from two crops per year (about&#13;
twice current production levels). Netcage fish culture raises commercial species in confined&#13;
cages positioned in a large body of water. While economically attractive netcage culture poses&#13;
potential environmental problems that would be mitigated under the project (para 44). Expected&#13;
annual production from 720 cages is about 600 tons. Oyster, hard clam and scallop production&#13;
techniques are well established in the area and pose few risks other than the low potential of&#13;
pollution impacts from external sources. Expected annual productions levels would be about&#13;
22,000 tons of oysters, 16,000 tons of clams and 5,800 tons of scallops (including shells).&#13;
W,hile exposure to devastating typhoons is a further risk for all subprojects, in practice strong&#13;
winds exceeding Force 8 are experienced only between 3-5 days each year and losses to existing&#13;
industry are insignificant to date.&#13;
38.   Estimated Costs and Financing. The Beihai aquaculture subproject is estimated to cost&#13;
about Y218 million (US$25.1 million equivalent), including land, and physical and price&#13;
contingencies (see Annex 9 for details). The Fangcheng subproject is estimated to cost about&#13;
Y108 million (US$12.4 million equivalent). Base costs are estimated in December 1994 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies are calculated at five percent of the base cost. Price contingencies have&#13;
been calculated for both foreign and local costs using Bank estimated escalation factors (Annex&#13;
5, para 9). The Bank Group would finance 55 percent of the estimated total project costs.&#13;
39.  Implementation Arrangements. In Beihai the project would be implemented and operated&#13;
by the Beihai Ocean Fishery Development Holding Co. (BOFDHC), an autonomous enterprise&#13;
owned jointly by national, provincial and municipal government-owned entities (Annex 5, para&#13;
60). The BOFDHC would include eight departments (responsible for planning, marketing,&#13;
processing, storage and transportation, hatcheries, technical services, training, and finance and&#13;
accounting), which would supervise five specialized operating companies and their related farms&#13;
established under the project, as well as the hatchery and its branches.&#13;
40.  In Fangcheng the project would be implemented and operated by the Fangcheng Ocean&#13;
Development Holding Co. (FODHC), an autonomous enterprise owned jointly by national,&#13;
provincial and municipal government-owned entities (Annex 5, para 60), including the municipal&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -                                 Annex 5&#13;
Fisheries Bureau. The FODHC would include seven departments (responsible for planning,&#13;
marketing, processing, hatcheries, technical services, training, and finance and accounting),&#13;
which would supervise four specialized operating companies and their related farms established&#13;
under the project.&#13;
41.   Supplies and services for construction of the aquaculture assets and facilities generally&#13;
would be procured through local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
Minor works, land preparation and cultivation would be carried out by force account.&#13;
42.   Employment. At peak production the aquaculture enterprises would expect to employ&#13;
about 7,000 permanent workers and about 500 seasonal workers (as detailed in Table 4 above).&#13;
The majority of workers would be migrants from Guangxi's poor areas and the targeted project&#13;
counties. Migrant workers would be provided on appropriate terms through the local Labor&#13;
Bureau inter-mediation system supported by SWPRP (See Annex 4). Workers would be housed&#13;
by the aquaculture enterprises in low-rise dormitories at standards similar to those agreed for&#13;
the Guangxi low income housing subcomponent (Annex 5, para 26).&#13;
43.   Cultivation of the various fields and beds, often located several kilometers offshore in&#13;
2-10 m water depth, is carried out by workers, mainly from boats. Some workers man watch&#13;
platforms located adjacent to the fields. Platforms are about 500 m apart and occupied&#13;
continuously by individual workers on two week rotational shifts. Platforms are roughly&#13;
constructed but include shelters with, in some cases, wind powered electricity generators. They&#13;
are serviced daily but rough weather can occur at any time. Safety of offshore operations would&#13;
be improved through the provision of training as well as life vests for all workers and, for&#13;
platform attendants, short range radio equipment. In addition the project would include new&#13;
boats and SCUBA diving equipment, and training in their use.&#13;
44.   Environmental Impact. With the exception of the freshwater shrimp ponds (135 ha)&#13;
which would be converted from paddy, no dry land requisition is required for the aquaculture&#13;
component, and no involuntary resettlement is required. Water quality in the areas concerned&#13;
has been certified by the local environmental protection bureau as conforming to national&#13;
standards for seawater for aquaculture usage. About half of the subproject would support&#13;
bivalve culture which requires no artificial feed stuff and can be considered true food production.&#13;
In contrast the culture of shrimps and fish in ponds or cages requires high levels of fishmeal or&#13;
trashfish input (dependent on the capture fisheries industries) and leads to a net consumption of&#13;
food. Accumulation of fecal waste from netcage fish culture can lead to anaerobic conditions&#13;
in the vicinity of a net cage, leading to local deterioration of the benthos and affecting fish&#13;
production. Adequate spacing and routine relocation would be carried out to avoid serious&#13;
impacts. In addition, netcage culture currently requires wild fingerlings as stock for many&#13;
economic species. Without adequate care, fingerling capture fisheries can be seriously damaged.&#13;
Development of hatchery technology for the species concerned would be supported by the project&#13;
and is expected to eliminate this risk in due course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -                                      Annex 5&#13;
Silviculture (Nannina)&#13;
45.   Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed silviculture (tree crops and forestry)&#13;
enterprises in Beihai and Fangcheng are to create stable employment for migrant workers from&#13;
the target poverty group, and to develop and expand the existing local tree crops and forestry&#13;
industries. Guangxi is an important longan fruit production region accounting for 25 percent of&#13;
China's planted longan area and output. Longan tree plantations in Guangxi are expected to&#13;
increase from 44,000 ha with 52,000 tons output in 1993 to 100,000 ha in 2000 with between&#13;
130,000 to 180,000 tons output. Since 1985, about 3,700 ha was planted in Nanning (based on&#13;
a high yield variety developed by the Guangxi Horticultural Institute), and produced 5,500 tons&#13;
of longan fruit in 1994. Fruit production falls under the Guangxi Agriculture Bureau while&#13;
forest products fall under the Forestry Bureau. Papermaking in the region is increasing its&#13;
demand for wood pulp as the industry converts from small scale, heavily polluting processes&#13;
based on grass fiber feedstocks to large scale and less polluting, wood fiber-based processes.&#13;
A new 100,000 tons per year capacity pulp mill now under construction in Nanning will require&#13;
a 500,000 m3 annual timber supply in 1998, of which about half can be supplied from suitable&#13;
local forests of eucalyptus and spruce in southern Guangxi. Output from the pulp mill is&#13;
expected to be taken up in large part by large proposed paper and fiber board mills planned in&#13;
the nearby Beihai area. Nanning's municipal area contains extensive undeveloped hilly tracts&#13;
suitable for tree plantations. Softwood plantations in this region were successfully supported by&#13;
Credit 2145-CHA, National Afforestation Project.&#13;
46.   Subproject Description.  The project would support the development in Nanning&#13;
Municipality of: (a) about 1,340 ha of longan fruit tree plantations and related facilities in&#13;
various locations in Liangqin, Nama, Datong, and Naxiao townships and the Taian state-owned&#13;
forest farm; and (b) about 8,000 ha of fast growing eucalyptus tree plantations in 15 townships/6&#13;
in Yongning and Wuming Counties, and Nanning city suburbs. Development of the subprojects&#13;
would include land improvement, saplings, cultivation inputs, small buildings, equipment and&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
47.    Estimated Costs and Financing. The Nanning silviculture project is estimated to cost&#13;
about Y80 million ($9.2 million equivalent), of which (a) the tree crops subproject is&#13;
estimated to cost about Y46 million (US$5.3 million equivalent), including land, and physical&#13;
and price contingencies, and (b) the forestry subproject is estimated to cost about Y35&#13;
million (US$4 million equivalent). Base costs are estimated in December 1994 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies are calculated at five percent of the base cost. Price contingencies&#13;
have been calculated for both foreign and local costs using Bank estimated escalation factors&#13;
/6   Including Shuxu (360 ha). Dating (240 ha), Nanxiao (150 ha), and Chengtang (250 ha) in Yongning County; Chengxiang (640 ha),&#13;
Fucheng (340 ha). Taiping (470 ha), Xianhu (420 ha), Luoxu (120 ha), Ningwu (50 ha), Luhan (300 ha), Liangjiang (60 ha) and Linnia (100&#13;
ha) in Wuming County; and Tangluo (2600 ha) and Zhuangding (1,900 ha) in the Nanning suburbs.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -                               Annex 5&#13;
(Annex 5, para 9). The Bank Group would finance 55 percent of the estimated total project&#13;
costs.&#13;
48.   Implementation Arrangements. Details of the implementation arrangements and&#13;
organization of the GX-MEDS subcomponent are described below (Annex 5 para 60). The&#13;
tree crops subproject would be implemented by the Nanning Longan Project Office (NLPO)&#13;
under the Fruit Office of the municipal Agriculture Bureau, jointly with participating villages&#13;
and farmers. NLPO would be responsible for repayment of the loan. The NLPO would&#13;
include five departments (responsible for planning and design, purchasing, extension services&#13;
and training, and finance and accounting), which would supervise the implementation of&#13;
plantations established under the project. Cultivation and operation would be the&#13;
responsibility of the plantations owners. Plantations in village areas totalling about 402 ha&#13;
would be jointly owned by the farmers concerned (25 percent shareholding) and NLPO. In&#13;
state farm areas plantations totalling about 500 ha would be jointly owned by the farm (25&#13;
percent) and NLPO. About 438 ha of plantations would be wholly owned by farmers.&#13;
Wholly owned plantations would receive loans in kind (seedlings and other inputs from&#13;
NLPO) and operate under NLPO supervision. They would also repay their loan obligations&#13;
in kind (longan fruit).&#13;
49.   The forestry subproject would be implemented by the Nanning Forestry Project&#13;
Office (NFPO) under the municipal Forestry Bureau, through its county and suburb level&#13;
offices jointly with participating village forest farms. Its structure, responsibilities and&#13;
operations would be similar to NLPO described above (Annex 5 para 47). Cultivation and&#13;
operation would be the responsibility of the villages. Villages would receive inputs in kind&#13;
(seedlings, fertilizer, pesticide, equipment, etc) which would be credited to their loan&#13;
account. Villages would repay their loan obligations following harvest.&#13;
50.    Supplies and services for construction of the tree crops and forestry assets and&#13;
facilities generally would be procured through local competitive bidding procedures&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank Group. Minor works, land preparation, planting and cultivation&#13;
would be carried out by force account.&#13;
51.   Employment. The tree crops and forestry subprojects are expected to generate about&#13;
1,900 permanent jobs and nearly 12,000 seasonal jobs (two to three months duration), of&#13;
which about 10,000 would be made available to the target poverty group in Guangxi through&#13;
the Labor Bureau intermediation system. Permanent workers would be housed by the farms&#13;
concerned in available rural housing stock and temporary workers would be accommodated&#13;
in camps.&#13;
52.   Environmental Imact. The plantations are expected to create a positive&#13;
environmental impact. Plantations would be established on previously uncultivated hillsides&#13;
and marginal lands, and would not require any land requisition or involuntary resettlement&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -                                Annex 5&#13;
measures. Cutting of the high growth eucalyptus would be carried out on a six-year cycle&#13;
and the stumps allowed to sprout and regrow for future cutting.&#13;
Vegetable Production Base (Beihai)&#13;
53.    Objectives. The objectives of the proposed vegetable production enterprise in Beihai&#13;
are to create stable employment for migrant workers from the target poverty group, and to&#13;
develop and expand the existing local vegetable production industry. Booming urban growth&#13;
in Beihai has been accompanied by rapid population growth and increases in disposable&#13;
income and standards of living (see Attachment 1), which in turn have created a significant&#13;
demand for fresh vegetables. Urban expansion however has converted existing vegetable&#13;
growing lands to other uses and local production fell from 43,700 tons in 1992 to 10,500&#13;
tons in 1994. To some degree the balance is now obtained from nearby Hepu County but&#13;
supplies are limited and prices have doubled. In addition to domestic demand, Beihai's&#13;
proximity to international markets such as Hong Kong creates further opportunities. Foreign&#13;
investors catering to the international fresh fruit market have recently established a major&#13;
citrus plantation as a joint venture in Beihai. Suitable soils and ample groundwater supplies&#13;
in the areas selected, as well as reliable and cheap labor, and a temperate climate strengthen&#13;
the potential for successful cash crop production in Beihai.&#13;
54.    Subproject Description. The proposed vegetable production base would be&#13;
established in three locations (near Baojia and Chidong villages and the Dufeng region in&#13;
Beihai City's suburbs) on a total of about 333 ha, of which 300 ha would be for open air&#13;
cultivation and 33 ha would be under cover. Full production is expected to average about&#13;
33,750 tons per year. The development would include a 1,800 m3 cold store, a 2,300 m2&#13;
cleaning and packing workshop and a 6,000 m2 warehouse and garage, together with&#13;
dormitories and facilities for the permanent workforce of some 2,200. A small (1,500 m2)&#13;
livestock farm would be included in order to make use of production waste. The project&#13;
would include deep well development, irrigation channels, buildings, vehicles and equipment,&#13;
including power supplies.&#13;
55.    Estimated Costs and Financing. The Beihai vegetable production subproject is&#13;
estimated to cost about Y46 million (US$5.3 million equivalent), including land, and physical&#13;
and price contingencies (see Annex 9 for detailed costs). Base costs are estimated in&#13;
December 1994 prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at five percent of the base cost.&#13;
Price contingencies have been calculated for both foreign and local costs using Bank&#13;
estimated escalation factors (Annex 5 para 9). The Bank Group would finance 55 percent of&#13;
the estimated total project costs.&#13;
56.   Implementation Arrangements. The project would be implemented and operated by&#13;
the Beihai Vegetable Base Co. (BVBC), an autonomous enterprise owned jointly by national,&#13;
provincial and municipal government-owned entities (Annex 5 para 61). The BVBC would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -                                         Annex 5&#13;
include seven departments (responsible for planning, marketing, production, purchasing,&#13;
personnel, training, and finance and accounting), which would supervise and assist the&#13;
related farms established under the sub project. Participating local villages and farmers&#13;
would be shareholders in the vegetable operations on their land. BVBC would be supported&#13;
by technical services provided by various Guangxi-based agricultural consulting&#13;
organizations.&#13;
57.     Supplies and services for construction of the vegetable production assets and facilities&#13;
generally would be procured through local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank Group. Minor works, land preparation, planting and cultivation would be carried out&#13;
by force account.&#13;
58.     Employment. The vegetable production enterprise is expected to require about 2,200&#13;
permanent workers and staff, and about 3,300 seasonal workers. About 70 percent of the&#13;
workers would be recruited from the target poverty group in Guangxi through the Labor&#13;
Bureau intermediation mechanism. Permanent workers would be housed in dormitories&#13;
provided by the BVBC. Dormitory standards would be equivalent to those agreed for the&#13;
low income housing subproject (Annex 5 para 26). Temporary workers would be&#13;
accommodated in camps.&#13;
59.     Environmental Impact. No land requisition is required for the vegetable base which&#13;
would be established under joint agreement with specific villages and tenant farmers. No&#13;
involuntary resettlement is required. A net positive environmental impact is expected as a&#13;
result of more scientific land management and recycling of production wastes.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
60.     The Guangxi PMO would maintain and manage a small technical assistance and&#13;
training fund (US$650,000 equivalent) for onlending to GX-MEDS project enterprises for&#13;
appropriate, project related technical assistance and training requirements/7. Applications to&#13;
the Provincial PMO for funding would follow a standard format specifying, inter alia:&#13;
objectives, outputs, inputs, management arrangements and timetables, and estimated costs.&#13;
Participating enterprises would be required to contribute at least 10 percent of the costs from&#13;
their own resources.&#13;
/7    Typical technical assistance needs could include research into breeding of fry from selected commercial fish species now obtainable&#13;
only in the wild - currendy a capture process with potentially negative environnmental impects. Tmining could include class room and on the&#13;
job training by visiting specialists and selected domestic and international study tours. Of particular importance will be the trining of workers&#13;
to be involved in aquaculture operations over open water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -                                Annex 5&#13;
Subcomponent Implementation Arrangements&#13;
61.    Project Management Implementation of the GX-MEDS subcomponent is the overall&#13;
responsibility of Guangxi Province's World Bank Project Management Office (a subsidiary of&#13;
the national project management office) and its subordinate project management offices in&#13;
Beihai, Fangcheng and Nanning Municipalities. Responsibility for day-to-day&#13;
implementation of individual subprojects would lie with various organizations, mainly&#13;
autonomous enterprises as described below, established for the purpose of development and&#13;
operation of the subproject facilities. The subproject organizations would be supervised by&#13;
their respective municipal project management offices during their formation phase and until&#13;
completion of the project on June 30, 2001. Thereafter each enterprise would be responsible&#13;
to an appointed board of directors.&#13;
62.    Project Enterprises. The various subprojects supported under GX-MEDS generally&#13;
would be developed and operated by autonomous corporate enterprises jointly owned by&#13;
national, provincial and municipal government entities. National interests are managed and&#13;
channelled through a holding company (Hua Da Economic Development Holding Co.) owned&#13;
by the State Council's National Poverty Alleviation Office. Similar subsidiary holding&#13;
arrangements apply at the provincial and municipal levels reflecting local interests,&#13;
overseeing wholly-owned operating companies at municipal and county levels. In rural&#13;
operating enterprise cases county and, in some cases, township and village governments, as&#13;
well as farmers, also have a significant interest. Exceptions to the foregoing occur in&#13;
Nanning where implementation of the tree crops and forestry subprojects would be carried&#13;
out by municipal agriculture and forestry bureaus.&#13;
63.   During the construction and business development phase a local enterprise would be&#13;
subject to the oversight of a leading group representing the owners' interests and the project&#13;
management office. During operation the owners of an enterprise would be represented&#13;
according to their shareholding in a supervisory board which approves the enterprise's&#13;
operational plans and monitors performance. The day to day operations of the enterprise,&#13;
including personnel management, are the responsibility of a general manager appointed by&#13;
the board. Enterprises would be registered with the respective local economic commission as&#13;
independent economic entities, they would maintain accounts and be responsible for their&#13;
own profits and losses.&#13;
64.    The enterprises would be the end users of the Bank loan proceeds and would be&#13;
responsible for repayment. About 30 percent of the various enterprises' physical assets&#13;
would be financed from equity capital and the balance, together with working capital, would&#13;
be fmanced from domestic loans and the proposed Bank loan (onlent by the local finance&#13;
bureau on terms equal to comparable ABC loan terms - Annex 5, para 10). The enterprises&#13;
are all expected to be labor intensive and would staff about 70 percent of their permanent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -                                Annex 5&#13;
(and temporary) workforces with workers from targeted poverty counties. In all cases the&#13;
enterprises would benefit from fixed term, local tax exemptions and other preferential&#13;
treatment as incentives to both establish in the area concerned and to employ the target&#13;
poverty group workers.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
65.   Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank have been agreed&#13;
with the subcomponent concerned agencies. Although relatively inexperienced in the Bank's&#13;
guidelines for procurement they would manage the process under the close supervision of the&#13;
Provincial PMO which has been staffed with experienced personnel. For procurement&#13;
purposes, the required works, materials and equipment would be broken down where&#13;
possible into annual packages suitable for local competitive bidding (LCB), and international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB). All works and goods procurement would be packaged wherever&#13;
practicable in contracts large enough to attract competition. Works and materials supply&#13;
contracts estimated to cost more than Y17 million ($2.0 million equivalent) and equipment&#13;
contracts estimated to cost more than Y1.7 million ($200,000 equivalent) should be procured&#13;
through ICB. Prudent shopping procedures would be followed for small quantities of&#13;
standard equipment and furnishings totalling not more than Yl million in each municipality.&#13;
Direct purchases of seeds, seedlings and fish fry would not exceed Y1O million in each&#13;
municipality. Establishment and cultivation of plantations, and field and aquatic crops would&#13;
be carried out by force account. Bids for contracts would not be called until complete bid&#13;
documents including detailed designs and bills of quantity are available. Bid documents&#13;
would conform to: (a) the China Model Bidding Documents and, in cases of ICB, (b) the&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents, where available. The Bank would review draft bid&#13;
documents for works and materials supply contracts estimated to cost more than Y20 million&#13;
and equipment supply contracts of Y2 million prior to bidding. Other contracts would be&#13;
subject to selective post award review. Adequate time should be allowed in implementation&#13;
schedules for procurement processing.&#13;
Project Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
66.   The national PMO would submit to the Bank on a quarterly basis consolidated&#13;
progress reports prepared by the local PMOs. The reports would document actual progress&#13;
against planned targets of physical and financial accomplishments and actual progress on&#13;
designated monitoring indicators (Annex 5, paras 21, 32). The reports would explain major&#13;
delays and the measures being taken to rectify matters.&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
67.   The financial analysis summarizes the key financial performance indicators of the&#13;
various enterprises established by the subcomponent. Similarly, the economic analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-                                  Annex 5&#13;
summarizes the key economic performance indicators for the various subprojects supported&#13;
by the loan. The analyses are based on individual enterprise and subproject projections&#13;
prepared by the municipal project preparation teams during 1994 and were reviewed and&#13;
updated by Bank staff in consultation with the project personnel during appraisal. This&#13;
analysis found that the subprojects offer an FIRR ranging from 12.8 percent (for housing in&#13;
Nanning and Fangcheng) to 33.5 percent for the Beihai Enterprise Zone.&#13;
Environmental Impact Summary&#13;
68.   Guangxi Province - for many years in the front line of China's adversarial relations&#13;
with neighboring Vietnam - is one of China's least developed and least intensively populated&#13;
provinces (186 persons/km2), and therefore also one of its least polluted, particularly in view&#13;
of the recently announced removal of the remaining land mines along the border. The&#13;
environmental challenge faced by Guangxi will be to conserve and protect its extensive&#13;
natural resources, especially its remarkable marine resources, in the face of forthcoming&#13;
rapid economic growth. It faces this challenge, however, relatively free from the typical&#13;
backlog of industrial pollution control faced by more developed provinces and cities.&#13;
Notwithstanding its poverty and low level of industrialization, Guangxi and the project&#13;
municipalities have established a body of legislation and environmental protection&#13;
organizations in government, agriculture and industry. These measures have created a strong&#13;
foundation for regulation and control of pollution and ecological degradation and the&#13;
enforcement of controls.&#13;
69.   Although the scale of activity supported by the subcomponent is relatively small and&#13;
widely dispersed the project sponsors have taken the opportunity to demonstrate sound&#13;
environmental planning principles in the preparation of the subprojects. The project would&#13;
support urban and rural development demonstrations in three of Guangxi's most important&#13;
municipal areas. It would strengthen municipal services (housing and light industrial estate&#13;
development) and support the development of agriculture, silviculture and aquaculture&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
70.   Involuntary Resettlement. Land and water area requirements of the subcomponent are&#13;
not expected to have a negative impact on existing users (in cases when the land and water&#13;
are already in use) and no involuntary resettlement would be required.&#13;
71.   Environmental Impact Assessment. According to local environmental analyses by&#13;
certified institutes, expected pollution impacts are relatively minor and subprojects would&#13;
include adequate mitigating measures, as described in Part B above. Industrial safety&#13;
conditions in the aquaculture subprojects are expected to improve as a result of the provision&#13;
of safety equipment and training.&#13;

Labor Mobility Component&#13;
Guangxi Municipal Employment Development Subcomponent&#13;
Socio-Economic Background&#13;
A. Beihai Municipality&#13;
72.   Beihai is one of three prefecture-level coastal cities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous&#13;
Region, and one of fourteen coastal open cities designated in 1984. Its current population is&#13;
estimated at 1.738 million people of which 500,000 reportedly live in the main urban district;&#13;
40% of this urban population is temporary. Beihai Municipal Government (BMG) authorities&#13;
estimate that the total population will grow to 1.9 million by the year 2000 (600,000 urban),&#13;
and to 2.85 million by the year 2010 (1 million urban). The city has a bulk cargo port/8 and&#13;
is connected to Nanning by a two-lane, Class 2 highway. A rail connection to Qinzhou and&#13;
Nanning is under construction and is scheduled for completion in early 1995.&#13;
73.   The city is located in a region rich in agriculture and mariculture: the primary sector&#13;
accounted for 28.8% of GDP and 60% of registered employment in 1993. However, both its&#13;
share of GDP and employment has been declining steadily in recent years while the&#13;
secondary sector's role has increased from 27% of GDP in 1990 to 37% in 1993; it&#13;
accounted for 13.3% of registered employment in 1990 and 15.6% in 1993. Industry's share&#13;
of gross output has risen from 54% in 1990 to 65% in 1993. The tertiary sector, primarily&#13;
related to tourism, accounted for 34% of GDP in 1993 and 24.5% of registered&#13;
employment/9.&#13;
74.   Beihai is now recovering from the collapse of a three-year, speculative real estate&#13;
boom that ended in 1993. Although GDP has almost tripled in real terms since 1990, much&#13;
of this growth emanated from real estate development. One positive outcome of this boom&#13;
has been the construction of extensive municipal infrastructure that has positioned Beihai to&#13;
capitalize on its location as a major terminus of Southwest China's existing and planned rail&#13;
and road network. BMG has recently shifted its development policy to encourage industrial&#13;
development, particularly in labor-intensive light industry.&#13;
/8   The port has a freight handling capacity of 2.34 million tons; it handled 1.22 million tons in 1993. There are ambitious plans to develop&#13;
deep water port facilities in Tieshan District.&#13;
/9   The city was designated a 'nationally important tourist city' in 1988; its 21 km.-long Silver Beach was declared a 'national tourism&#13;
vacation zone" in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -                             Annex 5&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
75.   The gross value of light industry output in Beihai has grown at an average 35.7% per&#13;
year in real terms since 1990. Much of this growth can be attributed to TVEs whose gross&#13;
output has grown by 596% in real terms during this period. The city's light industry&#13;
structure is oriented towards agriculture and mariculture: food and beverage processing&#13;
accounted for 67% of light industry output in 1993, up from 55% in 1990. The remaining&#13;
output is produced in a variety of much smaller sectors, including textiles (4.7%), paper&#13;
production (3.1%), and ceramics (1.4%).&#13;
76.   Although the number of temporary workers has declined this year to 200,000 due to&#13;
construction cutbacks, Beihai remains an important regional magnet for labor from poor&#13;
areas. Given Beihai's comparative advantages of location, good infrastructure, underutilized&#13;
port capacity, and the comparatively well-developed supporting tertiary sector, the city&#13;
appears to have a real potential for developing into a light industrial center in coastal&#13;
southwestern China. The realization of this potential will depend to a large extent on the&#13;
quality of marketing strategy that BMG prepares for its economic realignment (technical&#13;
assistance in this regard is being undertaken for this subproject).&#13;
B. Fangcheng Municipality&#13;
77.    The State Council officially declared Fangcheng a municipality in May, 1993. The&#13;
principal coastal port in Guangxi, Fangcheng has a territory of 5,300 km2 encompassing the&#13;
main city, one rural county, and two mostly rural districts, including the Dongxing Economic&#13;
Development Zone which borders with Vietnam. Fangcheng's population in 1994 is estimated&#13;
at 715,000 inhabitants of which 120,000 live in the urban area; 25% of this urban population&#13;
are temporary residents of which 80% are from poor rural areas. An estimated 62% of the&#13;
temporary population is registered with local authorities. Fangcheng Municipal Government&#13;
(FMG) officials estimate that, for the foreseeable future, the temporary population will grow at&#13;
15,000 per year. By the year 2000, the urban population of Fangcheng is expected to reach&#13;
400,000, of which 150,000 would be temporary residents (37.5%). One-third of the temporary&#13;
population is expected to be from poor rural areas.&#13;
78.   FMG is targeting the following employment opportunities for rural migrants up the year&#13;
2000: 10,000 labor jobs in ports and warehouses; 5,000 jobs in the construction sector; 15,000&#13;
in industry; 5,000 in infrastructure operations; and 15,000 in the tertiary sector. In the next&#13;
fifteen years, FMG expects that the temporary population will increase to 300,000 people, 60%&#13;
of the projected total population of 500,000 inhabitants; half of these are expected to come from&#13;
poor rural areas. At the present time, FMG estimates that 72.3 % of the temporary population&#13;
is employed in the tertiary sector (including port-related and construction activities).&#13;
79.   Fangcheng's port was established in the mid-1960s as a naval base. It became a "town"&#13;
in 1979, and its urban population began to increase from 4,000 to its current 120,000. The port&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -                             Annex 5&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
was expanded between 1978-81, but principally for defence reasons. From its original function&#13;
as a strategic naval base, Fangcheng has evolved into a key coastal commercial port in Guangxi&#13;
and the Southwest China Region: it is one of ten nationally-designated grain import ports, and&#13;
one of the four bulk cement ports in all of China. It currently handles almost 7 million tons of&#13;
bulk cargo a year; this capacity is expected to grow to 12 million tons by the year 2000. The&#13;
city's location at the end of a rail network that links the port with inner Guangxi, Guizhou and&#13;
Sichuan Provinces, and by the end of 1997 with Yunnan Province, makes it unique in southern&#13;
China. FMG is seeking to enhance its port functions through expansion of berths, development&#13;
of new port facilities to handle petroleum and natural gas, and strengthening of highway linkages&#13;
to Qinzhou and Nanning.&#13;
80.   Fangcheng enjoys many advantages that could strengthen its role as a major bulk cargo&#13;
port in Southwestern China. With the completion of the Kunming-Nanning railway line,&#13;
Fangcheng could become the key link between the region and outside markets. Bulk cargo&#13;
handling, and the basic processing activities associated with it, can be labor-intensive. As&#13;
Fangcheng's port functions increase in scope and size, the city will very likely continue to grow&#13;
in importance, attracting SWPRP clients seeking basic employment.&#13;
81.    Although its GVIO grew by 102% from 1990, Fangcheng's actual industrial base is&#13;
small: it was only 7.7% of Nanning's in 1993, and 30% of Nanning's on a per capita basis.&#13;
However, almost 55% of the city's GDP in 1993 came from the primary sector, mostly&#13;
agriculture, mining, and mariculture.&#13;
C. Nanning Municipality&#13;
82.   Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was designated an "open&#13;
city" only in June, 1992. Its current population is estimated at 2.64 million of which&#13;
approximately 1.1 million resides in the urban district (300,000 temporary). Nanning Municipal&#13;
Government authorities (NMG) estimate that the total population of Nanning will reach 3.2&#13;
million by the year 2000 (1.51 million urban), and 4.1 million by the year 2010 (2.5 million&#13;
urban). Aside from being Guangxi's principal city, Nanning is becoming an important rail&#13;
network hub/'Â°, and is also a significant inner harbor on the Yongjiang River, a western&#13;
tributary of the Pearl River (Nanning handles 30% more freight than Beihai).&#13;
83.    The city is an established inland distribution center that has largely developed through&#13;
domestic investment. Its economy is gradually shifting away from primary and secondary&#13;
/10  A Y 1.6 billion railway is under construction between Kunning and Nanning; when completed in 1997, it is expected to have an anual&#13;
freight capacity of 10 million tons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -                            Annex 5&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
activities to tertiary functions: from 1985 the percentage of the labor force employed in primary,&#13;
secondary, and tertiary sectors has shifted from 24:41:22 to 22:28:50.&#13;
84.    The city's GVIO has grown by over 32% in real terms since 1990, reflecting both a&#13;
modest increase in direct foreign investment and a pent up demand that was slow in being met&#13;
until the opening of the city in 1992. Nanning's industrial development has focused on food&#13;
processing, textiles and clothing, machinery, electronics, building materials, chemical&#13;
manufacturing, and medicinal products.   Almost 62% of GVIO in 1993 was from light&#13;
industry.&#13;
85.   Only two thirds of the temporary population appears to have registered with municipal&#13;
authorities: the 100,000 unregistered population is largely comprised of itinerant manual&#13;
workers, and occasional employees of COEs and private companies who are either unaware of&#13;
the need to formally register, or who seek to avoid paying annual labor management fees. NMG&#13;
estimates that almost 80% of its registered temporary population is employed in the urban area.&#13;
Of those employed, 44% are in the industrial sector, and 47% in the tertiary sector (including&#13;
37,000 in construction). NMG projects an annual increase of at least 30,000 temporary residents&#13;
per year until the year 2000.&#13;

Rural Infrastructure Component&#13;
Introduction and Sector Background&#13;
1.    The poorest villages of Southwest China, scattered in the often barren or semi-barren,&#13;
resource-deficient karst and mountainous regions, are at once remote and isolated.  The&#13;
ecologically degraded environment and complete absence of rural infrastructure make living&#13;
conditions harsh and arduous. Inhabitants in these regions often have to cover long distances by&#13;
foot and labor through steep terrains to reach the nearest source of drinking water; even so the&#13;
water source may sometimes be contaminated or contain high level of fluorides. The nearest&#13;
dirt roads are reached only after some kilometers of steep climb and descent by jungle tracks;&#13;
considerable man-power and effort are thus expended by villagers in bringing what small amount&#13;
of forest of agricultural produce there is to the nearest farmers' market. Lack of access to basic&#13;
facilities such as water supply, road, electricity and telecommunication constitutes a severe&#13;
constrain to the improvement of the lot of the poorest communities in these remote villages.&#13;
2.    The provision of rural infrastructure to ameliorate living conditions in the poor regions&#13;
in China has been a preoccupation of its Government especially since the early 1980s. In the&#13;
period 1984-93, the Central Government allocated a total of RMB Y10 billion under the 'yi gong&#13;
dai zhen' or food for work program alone for the construction of roads, water supply facilities&#13;
and water conservancy works in these areas. Achievements have been significant: hitherto about&#13;
56 million of the rural poor have been served with simple systems of water supply and since the&#13;
late 1980s a further 1,500 townships have been linked to the network of rural roads, while over&#13;
a million hectares of land has been rehabilitated through soil and water conservation works and&#13;
served with irrigation facilities. However, there remain some 50 million inhabitants in the poor&#13;
regions who have no access to potable water, and some 1,700 townships and 17,000&#13;
administrative villages have yet to be served with rural roads. In rural electrification, about 13&#13;
percent of rural households have yet to be served with some rudimentary form of electricity&#13;
supply. The remaining non-served areas include the poorest regions and to extend infrastructure&#13;
coverage to these will be more challenging, both technically and financially in view of the&#13;
remoteness of these thinly populated villages located in difficult, mountainous terrains. In line&#13;
with its objective to eradicate absolute poverty at the end of this century, the Central&#13;
Government has planned to allocate annually some RMB Y4 billion under the food for work&#13;
program over the period 1994-2000 for the construction of rural infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;

- 144 -                             Annex 6&#13;
Component Description&#13;
3.    The rural infrastructure component of the SWPRP forms an integral part of the multi-&#13;
sectoral developmental approach to attacking rural poverty and would be in active support of the&#13;
Government's on-going program to bring basic infrastructure facilities to the poorest regions of&#13;
the country.&#13;
4.    Targets. The specific targets for the rural infrastructure component would be to increase&#13;
the rural road coverage at village level to 90 percent; to provide potable water to about 25&#13;
percent of the population in the project area; to provide rural electricity to meet the requirements&#13;
of agro-processing, mining and other industries in the project area; and to construct irrigation&#13;
and soil conservation works for about 16,000 ha of paddy and upland crops.&#13;
5.    Rural Roads. To extend the coverage of rural road in the project area, a total of 1,608&#13;
km of gravel roads would be provided, linking a further 565 administrative villages to existing&#13;
network of county roads. Selection criteria would include: (a) roads which would serve a&#13;
number of villages with a sizable population, and (b) roads which would serve areas with a&#13;
concentration of project activities and where the generation of traffic volume is expected. The&#13;
roads would be constructed to Class IV road standards, with the following minimum technical&#13;
requirements:&#13;
Design speed                   20 km/hr&#13;
Width of formation             4.5 m&#13;
Width of carriageway           3.5 m&#13;
Radius of road                 15 m&#13;
Stopping sight distance        20 m&#13;
Maximum grade                  11 percent&#13;
Design Load for bridges/culverts  10 t&#13;
6.    Rural Water Supply. The rural water supply sub-component would serve an additional&#13;
667,000 people in 990 villages, or approximately 25 percent of the total population in the project&#13;
area. Selection criteria would include: (a) villages suffering from seasonal water shortage&#13;
exceeding 100 days in duration, (b) villages where the water source is more than 1.5 km away&#13;
or where the elevation difference between the water source and the place where the inhabitants&#13;
reside is more than 100 m; and (c) villages where existing water sources contain an unacceptable&#13;
level of fluorides and villages susceptible to epidemic and endemic diseases; an improvement in&#13;
the community supply will result in the betterment in public health.&#13;
7.    Water supply systems would be low-cost. Facilities would tap from springs or pump&#13;
from streams and underground rivers and would include piped systems with public hydrants and,&#13;
rain collectors serving individual households or several households. Water storage would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -                             Annex 6&#13;
provided to sustain supply up to 100 days in the dry seasons. Systems would be designed to&#13;
supply 25 to 40 liters per capita per day and would meet current water quality standards for rural&#13;
water supply in China.&#13;
8.    Rural Energy.  A total of 197 km of 375 kV and 675 km of 10 kV overhead&#13;
transmission and distribution lines and two mini-hydro power plant would be installed to increase&#13;
power supply to the project area, primarily to meet the requirements of the agro-processing and&#13;
light industries financed under the project as well as the needs of mining and other industries in&#13;
the project area, and additionally to meet domestic requirements in villages located alongside the&#13;
power supply lines. About 83,000 households in 378 villages would be served by the project&#13;
rural electrification schemes. Electrical works would conform to national technical standard$&#13;
currently in force.&#13;
9.    In some karst areas of Guangxi Province where there is chronic shortage of fuelwood due&#13;
to land degradation and progressive depletion of vegetation and where forest is closed to further&#13;
exploitation, biogas digester is a practical means of providing an alternate source of energy and&#13;
improved stoves has been used to save fuelwood by 50 percent.  The rural energy sub-&#13;
component would include the installation of 2,380 units of biogas digesters and 2,840 units of&#13;
improved stoves.&#13;
10.   Water Conservancy Works.  A variety of small-scale water conservation works&#13;
including irrigation, flood mitigation/agricultural drainage, and soil and water conservancy would&#13;
be implemented in the project area, including the upgrading and completion of the Fengguo&#13;
Irrigation Scheme in Yunnan Province.&#13;
11.   Irrigation. Irrigation would be provided for 13,000 ha of existing and new paddy and&#13;
upland crops. The proposed works would include the enlargement of three existing dams&#13;
(Jiumin in Guangxi, Yuanwozai in Guizhou and Fengguo in Yunnan, all exceeding 10&#13;
m in height); rehabilitation and construction of 516 irrigation ponds; rehabilitation and&#13;
lining of existing canals and construction of lined canals totalling 648 km; installation of&#13;
2,580 on-farm water cisterns ranging up to 20 cubic meters in storage capacity; and&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of 12 pumping stations.  In addition, the Fengguo&#13;
Irrigation Scheme would, apart from the enlargement of the reservoir storage, include&#13;
the construction of some 3 km of tunnel serving as the main supply canal and the&#13;
completion of the canal system. The completion of the Fengguo Irrigation Scheme would&#13;
serve to demonstrate the realization of irrigation potential of reservoir schemes through&#13;
the provision of appropriate tertiary irrigation facilities.&#13;
12.   Flood Mitigation/Agricultural Drainage. Flood mitigation and agricultural drainage&#13;
would be provided through the construction of two small dams for flood detention/silt&#13;
retention and minor tunnelling works to provide drainage channels in the karst areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                             Annex6&#13;
13.   Soil and Water Conservation. Conservation works would include the construction of&#13;
225 small valley check dams of rubble construction, 33 km of flood evacuation channels,&#13;
afforestation and establishment of vegetative cover and terracing over an area of 2,100&#13;
ha to arrest sheet and gully erosion.&#13;
Preparation and Review of Schemes&#13;
14.   Proposals for the rural infrastructure schemes have been compiled by the three provincial&#13;
project offices on the basis of submissions by county Water Conservancy and Electric Power&#13;
Bureaus (for water conservancy, rural water supply and rural electrification schemes) and county&#13;
Communication Bureaus (for rural road schemes). The great majority of the proposed schemes&#13;
proposed require further preparation and review prior to implementation. In order that each&#13;
scheme proposed for implementation under the project is technically feasible and economically&#13;
viable, and that engineering designs for these are prepared to a uniformly high standard,&#13;
provincial project offices would ensure that schemes prepared by county Water Conservancy and&#13;
Electric Power Bureaus and Communication Bureaus are reviewed and approved for&#13;
implementation by the technical bureaus concerned at prefecture level and, where applicable, at&#13;
provincial level. Project schemes would conform to the selection criteria and technical&#13;
standards. Rural road, rural electrification and water conservancy schemes should have a&#13;
minimum estimated economic rate of return of 10 percent, and unit investment cost for&#13;
individual rural water supply schemes should not exceed RMB Y300 per capita including&#13;
contingencies. A safety review would be required of any dams serving the project exceeding&#13;
10 meters in height or 2.5 million cubic meters. Such dams would subsequently be maintained&#13;
and inspected periodically in accordance with sound engineering practices, under arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
15.   At appraisal provincial project offices have proposed arrangements for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of rural infrastructure schemes completed under the project to ensure that the&#13;
facilities remain in good serviceable conditions during the project implementation period and&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
16.   Rural roads constructed to Class IV road standards and certified as such by&#13;
Communication Bureaus would either be included in the county annual road maintenance&#13;
programs or be placed under the charge of township Communication Stations concerned. In the&#13;
latter case an annual routine maintenance subsidy would be granted by Communication Bureaus&#13;
with beneficiary villagers providing duty labor for periodical or major repair work.&#13;
17.   Village committees would be responsible for organizing operation and maintenance of&#13;
rural water supply systems with full village participation. Normal Upkeep and major repair of&#13;
the completed facilities, operation for daily water supply and water rationing in times of shortage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -                             Annex 6&#13;
would be discussed by beneficiary villagers prior to implementation. Management committees&#13;
would be formed and persons appointed to be responsible for looking after the facilities. Water&#13;
fee would be collected either in cash or in kind to cover full operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
Villagers would contribute duty labor for major repair work.&#13;
18.   Rural electrification schemes completed according to technical standards and&#13;
specifications would be turned over to county Electric Power Companies, which operate as&#13;
independent enterprises and would recover full costs including costs of operation and&#13;
maintenance, major repair and depreciation through tariff for electricity supply.&#13;
19.   Operation and maintenance of the water conservancy works completed under the project&#13;
would be arranged by county Water Conservancy Bureaus. Water fee would be progressively&#13;
increased to recover full operation and maintenance cost.&#13;

SOUTHWEST POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT&#13;
LAND AND FARMER DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    Livelihood systems in the project area are based on subsistence farming, with intermittent&#13;
access to small amounts of cash from agricultural and off-farm activities. The average per capita&#13;
income level is slowly increasing, but poor households have been largely left out of this&#13;
development trend. The objective of the land and farmer development component is to help the&#13;
majority of the more than 600,000 project households cross the gap from less-than-subsistence&#13;
farming at present to modest levels of surplus production and greater cash income levels at&#13;
project full development.&#13;
2.    Farming communities in the project area face both an extremely limited natural resource&#13;
bases and remoteness from markets and services. Potential production solutions to chronic food&#13;
deficits are limited. A development project in such an environment was a new approach in&#13;
China, and required a specific strategy. The strategy selected is based on (a) the geographical&#13;
concentration of the investment, (b) village development plans integrating tree crops, animal&#13;
husbandry, and food production with other project components, and (c) the improvement of poor&#13;
farmers' access to agricultural support services.&#13;
3.    Land Use Systems. The project area stretches over more than 700 kilometers from north&#13;
to south, with climatic conditions ranging from mountain temperate to tropical. Its northern half&#13;
is the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, while the southern half is the karst range region of southwest&#13;
Guizhou and northwest Guangxi. The entire area faces similar constraints which are specific&#13;
to karst environments: (a) only a small portion of the total land area is suitable for crop&#13;
production, and natural resources are in a degraded state in the remainder of the land area, (b)&#13;
karst hydrological regimes result in insufficient drinking water and, together with elevation,&#13;
restrict paddy cultivation and double-cropping, (c) no cash crop provides a stable source of cash&#13;
income, and (d) the effectiveness of previous government interventions to intensify food crop&#13;
production has been limited.&#13;
4.    Limited Resource Base. 1/ In the karst range region, open karst landscapes are found&#13;
on 75 percent of the counties' land area. The remaining area comprises red soil hills. In&#13;
Guangxi, despite an annual mean temperature of 20Â°C, 1,500 mm of rainfall per year, and an&#13;
1/    This Annex is based on information provided by the three provincial project management&#13;
offices, by 6 counties (Luquan, Wuding and Yiliang in Yunnan; Puding in Guizhou;&#13;
Mashan and Duan in Guangxi), on observations during project development field visits,&#13;
and interviews with farmers, government workers from township to national level and&#13;
provincial researchers, carried out by the five consultants who have taken part in&#13;
technical preparation, preappraisal and appraisal. Project area statistics are in Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -                               Annex 7&#13;
average elevation of only 200-700 meters, karst villages are resource-poor areas. "Sink holes"&#13;
in between peaks, from 1 to 5 hectares in size, are the only space available for crop production.&#13;
Guizhou karst features 30 percent of the land area in milder slopes, but winter temperatures&#13;
decrease as elevation increases from 1,000 m in the south to 1,500 m in the north. Limestone&#13;
soils, although originally having fair levels of fertility with a balanced pH, display nutrient&#13;
depletion problems for both major (phosphorus and potassium) and trace elements (zinc and&#13;
copper) and locally severe erosion.&#13;
5.    The Yunnan-Guizhou plateau is a northern high-elevation extension of the karst area, with&#13;
limestone as parent material over 40 percent of the area. The average elevation is 2,300 meters&#13;
in Northeast Yunnan, and the climate is distinctly cold and dry. At elevations of 2,000 m, mean&#13;
annual temperatures are less than 12Â°C and the annual rainfall is 700 mm with very dry winters.&#13;
Whether based on limestone or metamorphic material, soils are mainly acidic, leached yellow&#13;
earths, and are very poor in phosphorus and trace elements.  Purple soils on shales, and&#13;
limestone soils on karst slopes, are particularly vulnerable to erosion. In addition to this poor&#13;
resource base in the uplands, the Yangtze River system has created deep valleys which benefit&#13;
from a warm climate but form dry, degraded and remote environments.&#13;
6.    Watersheds in the karst range region cover at most only a few natural villages, and&#13;
cropping mainly takes place on narrow stone-walled terraces on lower slopes. Only 5 percent&#13;
of the land area is cultivated. The remaining land, two thirds of which consists of steep rocky&#13;
slopes, comprises mostly degraded forest and bushes. It is used as extensive pasture, but food&#13;
crops are also grown in between rocks, in earth basins sometimes less than 1 meter in diameter.&#13;
Apart from a few government-backed plantations where Pinus massoniana and Cunninghamia&#13;
lanceolata predominate, there are no large forest areas.&#13;
7.    On the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, watersheds range in size from one to several townships.&#13;
One fourth of the land area is cultivated in Guizhou and 15 percent in Yunnan. The forest area,&#13;
7 percent, consists of a few large conservation forests with mainly Pinus yunnanensis. Most of&#13;
the remaining 60 percent of the land area is used as common pasture. Half of it, located on&#13;
open karst, has very limited potential for increased production. There are visible signs of&#13;
on-going degradation, due not only to timber cutting, but also increasingly to overgrazing by&#13;
goats.&#13;
8.    Continuing Resource Degradation.  Recent decades have witnessed the continuing&#13;
degradation of the resource base. In order to provide fuelwood and timber to industries, heavy&#13;
deforestation occurred even in remote areas. With rapid population growth and restricted&#13;
out-migration, the available farmland per capita decreased to 0.06 ha in the karst range region&#13;
and 0. 1 ha on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau. As market access was limited and agricultural&#13;
policy only supported grain production, farmers had no capacity to develop those activities which&#13;
better fit the natural resource base, such as forestry, tree crops and animal raising, and could&#13;
only extend food crops onto marginal sloped land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -                               Annex 7&#13;
9.    The degradation of the resource base is related to migration patterns of previous&#13;
centuries. The project area includes the region where the Han stopped their southwestern&#13;
migration and settled into the midst of local ethnic groups. Moreover, the late-coming migrating&#13;
groups, the Miao and Yao people, were confined in the uplands where they practiced shifting&#13;
cultivation. This pattern of human settlement was particularly unsustainable in northeast&#13;
Yunnan, where neighboring Sichuan province was already a haven for migrants.&#13;
10.   Decollectivization in the 1980s was another period of resource degradation. Insecure&#13;
land tenure arrangements resulted in further deforestation. Large tracks of terraces and water&#13;
conservation schemes were subject to rapid decay. Finally, draft animals could not be evenly&#13;
distributed and the intensity of cultivation consequently declined.&#13;
11.   Cropping Patterns. In the karst range region, project villages are located away from&#13;
larger irrigated valleys, which are typically planted to double-crop paddy in Guangxi and to&#13;
paddy followed by rapeseed and wheat in Guizhou. Paddy in Guizhou accounts for 20 percent&#13;
of the cultivated area in most villages, but is grown by only 20 percent of the households. This&#13;
crop is totally absent in Guangxi's karst villages, although paddy terraces are found in villages&#13;
located on red soil hills. Although the 0.3 hectare-large typical farm is entirely double-cropped,&#13;
the cropping system is restricted to one crop of corn followed by one marginal crop of soybeans&#13;
or early maturing corn in Guangxi, and winter potatoes or wheat in Guizhou.&#13;
12.   The average farm on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau grows corn, potato, buckwheat, rye&#13;
and pulse crops on 0.5 ha. Winter wheat, restricted to lower elevations, is grown on 40 percent&#13;
of the cultivated area in Guizhou, 20 percent in Yunnan. The intercropping of potato with corn&#13;
has been developed for higher elevations, but requires a high level of inputs. Paddy, grown in&#13;
rotation with wheat and faba beans, occupies 5 percent of the farmed area but is confined in&#13;
villages with an elevation lower than 1,500-1,800 m. Rainfed fields extend to steep slopes and&#13;
elevations above 2,300 m. In these high elevation areas, corn is not grown. Instead, buckwheat&#13;
swiddens comprise 10 percent to the cultivated area.&#13;
13.   Throughout the project area, average corn yields are only 2.5 tons/ha.  Corn&#13;
intensification is limited to certain areas where uneven urea applications allow yields of 3.5&#13;
tons/ha. Elsewhere yields remain as low as 1.5 ton/ha -- far less than the average yields of 6.5&#13;
tons/ha achieved in areas with intensive use of modern inputs.&#13;
14.   Cash-income Generating Activities. Cash crops have been the basis of agricultural&#13;
development in project counties, but project villages have not participated to a significant extent&#13;
in this process. Tobacco in project villages located on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau is limited&#13;
by elevation, and sugarcane in the karst ranges by transportation costs and water resources.&#13;
Without these crops, farmers have no stable source of cash to buy agricultural inputs for food&#13;
crops, and reliable marketing channels for these inputs have not been set up. However, as urban&#13;
and industrial markets are coming within reach of mountain counties, local governments are&#13;
promoting production bases for a wider range of cash crops, particularly tree crops including&#13;
tea, fruit trees, nuts, medicinal forest products and timber plantations, as well as mulberry and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -                               Annex 7&#13;
silk production. These bases are initially located in valleys closer to county seats. While they&#13;
are starting to expand towards the uplands along the road network, few project villages have&#13;
been reached so far.&#13;
15.   Thanks largely to increasingly active rural fairs, many project area households are now&#13;
investing in pig production. Households in the three provinces now keep on average 1.4 to 2.1&#13;
pigs, and sell 0.8 to 1.3 head every year. Cattle and buffalo are still used primarily for&#13;
plowing, and only 10 percent of the population of these animals is marketed each year. The&#13;
poorest households are those unable to raise any animals. Ten percent of project households do&#13;
not raise pigs, and half have no draft animals.&#13;
16.   Land use systems in project villages suffer from chronic cash shortfalls. Cash income&#13;
levels are low and unstable, and farmers direct cash towards short-term investments such as&#13;
nitrogen fertilizer applications and pig feed. The majority of households rely on short-term cash&#13;
advances every year to meet their subsistence needs, but individual households have almost no&#13;
access to formal rural credit. 2/ Therefore livelihood systems are two-tiered. Farmers use&#13;
extensive mountain farming systems to minimize risks for staple crops and, at the same time,&#13;
they develop cash-oriented activities.&#13;
17.   Government Assistance. Policies and agricultural extension activities have remained&#13;
focused on corn intensification. 3/ Intensifying the only crop which has a high yield potential&#13;
is a sound strategy, but has not been effective in the poorest villages in the project counties.&#13;
The same packages, based on hybrid corn with plastic sheet mulching, have been extended to&#13;
(a) areas with more potential, for which the objective is to reduce the overall county grain&#13;
deficit, and (b) resource-poor areas. Plastic sheet hybrid corn has proven to be economically&#13;
feasible only where supplementary irrigation is available, or where subsidies or interplanted&#13;
crops (particularly potatoes in Northeast Yunnan), reduce the effective cost of plastic sheeting.&#13;
Furthermore, this technology tends to increase soil erosion, and depletes soil mineral reserves&#13;
when not used along with adequate fertilizer quantities. Seed production bases are not large&#13;
enough to meet increased demand for hybrid seeds, and have problems distributing seeds to&#13;
remote counties. The variety selection process has also seldom taken farmers' consumption&#13;
habits and tastes into account. Farmers who adopt hybrid varieties typically have higher income&#13;
levels and are in the position to exchange a large part of their corn production for rice and wheat&#13;
for home consumption, or to use the corn as animal feed.&#13;
18.   Due to limited funding and other constraints, government intervention in poverty areas&#13;
has relied on methods designed for intensive agriculture in flat land areas.  In contrast to&#13;
Northwest China's Loess Plateau, which has greatly benefitted from extensive govemment&#13;

support for applied agricultural research (see Strategies), there is no national research program&#13;
for karst environments, and no adapted technology packages are available. Guizhou and&#13;
Guangxi have research facilities for forestry, including non-wood forest products, but these&#13;
rarely address the special needs and potential of upland areas.  For livestock, technical&#13;
experience for pasture development has been provided by Australia and New Zealand.&#13;
However, research on upland crop production has only begun in recent years in Yunnan, and&#13;
little research has been carried out on watershed management and terracing methods. Research&#13;
and demonstration sites of integrated land use consist of only a few villages called "ecological&#13;
agriculture villages".&#13;
B. Selection and Design of Component Activities&#13;
19.   Component Strategy. The component would take better advantage of the actual natural&#13;
resource base of upland villages, exploit emerging markets, and capitalize on favorable ongoing&#13;
policy reforms.  The principal risks associated with the component are the uncontrolled&#13;
development of wastelands and unequal access to project benefits.&#13;
20.   Concentration of the Investment.  The total project area and population has been&#13;
constrained to a level consistent with an average agricultural investment per household of Y&#13;
1,200 to Y 1,600 (in base cost values). Comprising only half the townships of the 35 project&#13;
counties, selected project townships are situated in the upper and lower parts of the watersheds&#13;
on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and are located away from larger valleys in the karst range area.&#13;
Furthermore, the investment is focussed on 52 percent of the administrative villages in project&#13;
townships (see SAR paras. 2.42-2.44).&#13;
21.   Village Plans for Wasteland Development. Ongoing favorable policy reforms now make&#13;
possible better utilization of the large area of wasteland (poorly utilized slope land) through the&#13;
development of forest products, tree crops and fodder production. The 8-7 Plan has shifted from&#13;
a single focus on grain self-sufficiency to support for more diversified agricultural activities.&#13;
Tree crops would play an important role both as a source of income and as a contribution to&#13;
environmental protection. Longer term land tenure rights for wasteland are just starting to be&#13;
implemented. A large range of tree crop species adapted to karst and mountain environments&#13;
has already been identified (Table 3), and forest, except in arid valleys in Northeast Yunnan,&#13;
may regenerate on slopes within two decades. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the&#13;
component focuses on developing tree crops on wasteland.  Since forest plantation and&#13;
regeneration are already addressed by other on-going programs, project investment will be&#13;
primarily directed to other tree crops. Pasture development is only an option at high elevations&#13;
in Yunnan. Elsewhere, interplanted fodder trees and grass are more appropriate.&#13;
22.   Integrated Support of Cash Income Generating Activities. On the basis of village plans,&#13;
the project supports an integrated set of activities for several years. As far as possible and for&#13;
as many households as possible, the village plan includes increased agricultural inputs for food&#13;
crops integrated with (a) investment in activities generating cash income in the near term, such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -                               Annex 7&#13;
as pig raising, annual cash crops or mulberry, and (b) the development of longer term activities,&#13;
particularly tree crops. The investment includes the cost of tree crop inputs until the first&#13;
marketable harvest.&#13;
23.   Another means to increase cash incomes in corn-based land use systems in the project&#13;
area is better utilization of corn stalks. Full advantage can be taken of this resource, since other&#13;
sources of fuel, including shallow coal deposits on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and fuelwood&#13;
resources which are starting to regenerate in the karst range region, are available. The project&#13;
invests in improved technologies (manual and mechanized corn stalk shredders and ammoniated&#13;
stalk tanks) to use corn stalk as feed. This, together with the development of other fodder&#13;
resources, will allow a marked increase of animal numbers, which will in turn provide more&#13;
organic fertilizer for corn intensification.&#13;
24.   Farming systems in the project area comprise the following two sub-systems: slightly&#13;
intensified corn in more fertile plots, and extensive corn with a wide range of other food crops&#13;
in other plots. While the improvement of the first sub-system must rely on increased use of&#13;
modern inputs, lower-cost technologies have the potential to improve the second. Project area&#13;
farmers are aware of modern inputs, and are willing to use them, provided they have stable cash&#13;
incomes and reliable sources of input supply. It is expected that, by the time of project full&#13;
development, cash incomes will increase to levels sufficient to provide facilitate increased use&#13;
of such modern inputs. In addition, the introduction of appropriate varieties and the reduction&#13;
of post-harvest losses can improve the food balance at minimum  cost.  However, such&#13;
technologies have not been adequately explored, and careful applied research must be initiated.&#13;
Research needs identified during project preparation include the upgrading of potato storage in&#13;
farmers' houses, the prevention of rat damage, the improvement of compost made of forest&#13;
leaves, and the introduction of varieties of secondary grain crops, such as rye and buckwheat,&#13;
from Himalayan and alpine regions where these are major crops.&#13;
25.   Government Intervention and Farmer Participation. The design and implementation of&#13;
village plans are expected to be a process where both government agencies and local&#13;
communities gain more means and expertise in land use planning, in order to take full advantage&#13;
of the project, and to sustain development efforts after the project ends. In particular, an&#13;
approach enhancing the participation of local communities has been supported. Counties and&#13;
townships have prepared menus of options for households' agricultural investment. During&#13;
implementation, on-farm research sites would play a key role in further demonstrating the&#13;
efficiency of participatory approaches.&#13;
C. Component Risks&#13;
26.   Equity. The actual level of investment of each household must be great enough to&#13;
achieve a sustainable increase in incomes and well-being. At the same time, the better-endowed&#13;
parts of the project area, as well as the small portion of entrepreneur farmers, are in a position&#13;
to absorb much higher investments than the average available figure. Taking into account the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -                              Annex 7&#13;
limitations inherent to monitoring the access of 600,000 households to project benefits, the&#13;
simple means of limiting investment on the basis of a maximum per capita investment (see Box&#13;
1) was agreed upon for the land and farmer development component.&#13;
Box 1: Investment Level Per Household&#13;
The project includes only the poorest quarter of the 35 project counties' administrative&#13;
villages. Limiting the number of project beneficiaries in this way allows for an average&#13;
investment per household of Y 1,200 in Yunnan, Y 1,450 in Guizhou, Y 1,600 in Guangxi (40&#13;
percent of these figures being farmers' own labor and on-farm produced inputs). The following&#13;
considerations guided component investment intensity decisions:&#13;
*     Households' maximum investment level would be twice the above mentioned averages:&#13;
Y 2,400 in Yunnan, Y 2,900 in Guizhou, and Y 3,200 in Guangxi.&#13;
*     7 percent of the investment would be directed to agricultural support services.&#13;
*     These levels of investment would be sufficient to support the equivalent of 3 cows, or 2&#13;
sows, or 0.02 hectare of pond aquaculture, or 0. 15 hectare of longan, or 0.4 ha. of&#13;
medicinal/spice tree crop per household.&#13;
27.   To achieve equitable household access to services, project support for training would&#13;
allow direct training of 56 percent of all project households, thereby including a large number&#13;
of illiterate farmers. Technical support and marketing services would be provided to farmers&#13;
willing to join tree crop and animal production bases, as well as to those investing in the&#13;
improvement of their own home gardens or animals. As these guidelines depart from the&#13;
prevailing practices, their implementation will have to be closely monitored.&#13;
28.   Wasteland Development. The major risks in the development of wastelands are related&#13;
to land tenure and to markets (see Box 2). Much of the land registered as wasteland is actually&#13;
already planted to food crops. However low-yielding those plots may be, they are essential as&#13;
an emergency food resource, particularly for the absolute poor. Important problems in the&#13;
recent past have been (a) tree planting programs undertaken without the consent of farmers, and&#13;
(b) the ongoing attribution of the usufruct of some tracts of wasteland to entrepreneur farmers&#13;
through auction sales. In the Yangtze River reforestation scheme in Northeast Yunnan, for&#13;
example, there is a clear negative impact of plantations on villages' grassland resources. 4/&#13;

29.   An assurance would be sought at negotiations that, for all land planted to tree crops under&#13;
the project, farmers receive long-term, individual and inheritable land use rights, without having&#13;
to pay for it. Fodder intercropping in reforestation schemes, for cut-and carry during trees'&#13;
young stages, and for grazing later on, should also be allowed.&#13;
30.   Most of the tree and cash crop species adapted to karst and/or mountain environments,&#13;
such as Chinese medicinal products, minor spices and resins, yield products which are subject&#13;
to limited and unstable markets. Counties have appropriately directed some of their TVE&#13;
investment to processing of these products, and there is a consequential need for continuing&#13;
market assessment as a routine part of component monitoring.&#13;
Box 2: Wastelands&#13;
The following considerations have been taken into account in component activities which&#13;
involve wastelands in project areas:&#13;
*     Under Chinese Land Administration law, wasteland is that land neither registered as&#13;
cultivated land nor attributed to other uses (mainly forestry and grazing).&#13;
*     Local usufruct situations are complex. In one village may be found individual contracts&#13;
with households, collective contract with villages, or the land may have remained under&#13;
the township Land Bureau.&#13;
*     There is presently some 641,000 hectares of wasteland in the project villages. Of this,&#13;
16,000 ha have already be planned by townships for food crops (in Yunnan only), 58,000&#13;
ha for trees crops, 123,000 ha for forestry and some 250,000 ha for grassland.&#13;
*     At least 191,000 hectares of project area wasteland is in fact already be planted to&#13;
extensive food crops (mostly corn), an area equivalent to 70 percent of the 284,000&#13;
hectares of registered cultivated land.&#13;
*     Under the project, more than 56,000 hectares of wasteland would be planted to tree&#13;
crops.&#13;
D. Component Implementation&#13;
31.   Selection of Subprojects. The 35 counties have prepared their own subprojects for each&#13;
crop or animal species they plan to develop. The review of subproject proposals by provincial&#13;
management offices has followed rules to ensure the adequate targeting of the absolute poor and&#13;
technical and economic viability. As the component would be implemented on a program basis,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -                               Annex 7&#13;
it is expected that counties will readjust their proposals during the life of the project. These&#13;
readjustments would be undertaken on the basis of the guidelines established during project&#13;
preparation.&#13;
32.   Although all project areas would each receive a balanced share of project investment,&#13;
individual activities would be closely tailored to local natural resources, climatic conditions, and&#13;
market status. For example, fruit trees and tea are best adapted to red soils, mulberry and&#13;
annual cash crops require more fertile soils, and semi-tropical crops are best suited to the arid&#13;
valleys of the Yangtze River system.  The advance of agricultural inputs for food crop&#13;
improvement would be restricted to corn in Guangxi and Guizhou, and to corn and potato in&#13;
Yunnan. The investment in paddy would be limited to small-scale paddy land development&#13;
schemes. All households currently not raising an animal would receive the opportunity to&#13;
engage in animal husbandry, particularly goat raising and pig fattening. Finally, flexibility in&#13;
the implementation of planned subprojects would be needed in order to take into account the&#13;
evolution of markets.&#13;
33.   Selection of Technical Standards. Fruit and other tree crops are subject to significant&#13;
levels of commercial and technical risk. Since project households have little or no financial&#13;
capacity to bear these risks, and would indeed be unwilling to do so, technical standards were&#13;
selected in order to reduce these risks as far as possible. This implied the use of technologies&#13;
which are less intensive than those used in plain areas in China, and are better suited to&#13;
small-scale household farming. This was often a new approach in project counties, particularly&#13;
for fruit trees.&#13;
34.   Even at the cost of reduced total output during the earlier years of production, tree crop&#13;
densities and fertilizer application rates would be set at reasonably low levels. Fertilizer&#13;
applications for both perennial and annual crops would focus on phosphorus, potassium and trace&#13;
elements, in relation with soil deficiencies, and not on nitrogen. The quality of seeds and&#13;
seedlings, and their adaptation to the environment and to consumer demand would be carefully&#13;
taken into consideration. Pesticides would be of low toxicity (pyrethrenoid insecticides, for&#13;
example, would partly replace organophosphorate ones).&#13;
35.   Over-engineering would also be avoided. Terracing for grain crops would generally be&#13;
restricted to the rehabilitation of more fertile terraced plots, or to stopping locally intense&#13;
on-going erosion. Terracing for tree crops would not commonly be undertaken, and in any case&#13;
should be limited to I to 1.5 meter large contour belts. Irrigation development would be for&#13;
labor-intensive irrigation only, and would mainly consist of small water tanks for fruit trees, nuts&#13;
and corn. No warehouses would be built in villages.&#13;
36.   The same approach is also necessary for animal husbandry and aquaculture. Animal&#13;
housing would use simple local materials. Marketing rates would only be expected to increase&#13;
slowly. Pig and poultry feed would mostly be processed on the farm using farmers' own corn&#13;
and by-products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -                              Annex 7&#13;
37.   Village Plans. Appropriate phasing of component activities is essential to generating&#13;
beneficiaries' confidence in the component activities and maintaining farmers' interest in&#13;
participating in these activities. Some project activities would be expected to last four years.&#13;
A proportion of participating farmers would only join activities on the second year. Each&#13;
household would then require three years to complete tree crop plantations: plantations would&#13;
be spread on two years in order to limit technical risks at plantation, and the impact of alternate&#13;
bearing later on; additional planting to compensate seedling losses would take place on years 2&#13;
and 3.&#13;
38.   Some of the counties, villages and farmers would take the lead, and serve as&#13;
demonstration cases for neighboring areas. This is an usual process in China, but the project&#13;
has set up guidelines so that demonstration situations are not only better-off ones, do not absorb&#13;
an unbalanced part of the investment, and that their different environment is taken into account&#13;
when extending their experience to other situations. In addition, a significant number of new&#13;
demonstration farmers would be selected, including minority people and women farmers, and&#13;
literacy would not be a prerequisite for participating demonstration farmers.&#13;
39.   Improvement of Services. In order to set up reliable channels of agricultural inputs, the&#13;
project provides support for seedling nurseries, seed companies and veterinary services. A&#13;
central nursery would be upgraded in each county, and agriculture and forestry bureaus would&#13;
train skilled farmers to become specialized in this field, so that seedling production can be&#13;
sustained after project completion. Seed companies would invest in expanding their production&#13;
bases and warehouse capacity, under the conditions that they (a) produce both (i) hybrid corn&#13;
and (ii) non-hybrid corn and seeds of secondary grain crops, and (b) emphasize virus-free potato&#13;
seed production. Some counties would modify their extension regulations so that valuable&#13;
non-hybrid corn varieties, although offering lower yields, may pass official variety tests, and the&#13;
project would support the dissemination of the experience gained to the rest of the project area.&#13;
Finally, vaccination services would be extended to poorer townships.&#13;
40.   The investment in agricultural extension would support more frequent contact between&#13;
extension agents and project households. Township extension workers, until now in charge of&#13;
implementing separate programs in grain crops, special crops, forestry and animal husbandry,&#13;
should form a comprehensive task force to support village programs. They would visit villages,&#13;
particularly the expanded network of demonstration farmers, and organize training days for&#13;
households. Households would be trained not only on technical matters but also on farm&#13;
management basics. Township technicians' training would focus both on specialized crops or&#13;
animal types and on village land use. In addition to those subjects, some of the county&#13;
technicians would receive training in market awareness.&#13;
41.   Applied res*rch would be an effective means of identifying farmers' needs, and of&#13;
designing and exteqling related low-cost technologies for food crops and animal husbandry. It&#13;
would also play a coordinating role in the choice of relevant species and varieties for tree and&#13;
food crops. Finally, it would be in charge of regularly upgrading technical standards during&#13;
project implementation, particularly for tree crops, as well as monitoring pests and diseases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 162 -                              Annex 7&#13;
E. Monitoring&#13;
42.   The monitoring plan is designed to provide timely information on (a) the physical&#13;
progress for component activities (i.e., crop establishment and land development area, numbers&#13;
of animals purchased, training and extension activities, etc.), (b) the availability and use of&#13;
critical inputs including seeds, seedlings, and veterinary services, and (c) trends in the identified&#13;
risks.&#13;
43.   Contracts set up with county agriculture and forestry bureaus in charge of tree seedling&#13;
nurseries, and with provincial and county seed companies, would request the timely supply of&#13;
information regarding the names and characteristics of varieties produced, the results of quality&#13;
inspection, and the schedule of shipment to project townships. The monitoring of animals&#13;
purchased would take place at the time when these animals are vaccinated by township agents.&#13;
Consultants would be required for market follow-up.&#13;
44.   Contracts set up with project villages would specify (a) households' rights related to the&#13;
main identified risks, including the attribution of land tenure rights prior to tree crop&#13;
establishment, the free decision to join village production bases, the right to carry on&#13;
interplanting food and fodder crops in tree plantations, the opportunity for every household to&#13;
invest in household animal husbandry, and access to training and technical support services, (b)&#13;
the maximum agricultural investment per household, and (c) principles for sound environmental&#13;
and watershed management. In particular, animal numbers and management would remain&#13;
within limits allowed by drinking water and grazing resources. The design and implementation&#13;
of these contracts would be monitored by offices of various levels, including the provincial&#13;
project management offices. Direct interviews of project households would be an appropriate&#13;
monitoring mechanism.&#13;
45.   Information regarding training and extension activities would be provided by counties and&#13;
would include (a) the names and villages of farmers taking part in the demonstration network&#13;
(highlighting new additions), and (b) the dates and locations of training activities, with audience&#13;
numbers. Finally, the identification and approval of relevant research proposals would take&#13;
place every year. The dissemination of research results through field days, meetings and written&#13;
information would be planned and monitored.&#13;

Poverty Monitoring Component&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   An independent and effective poverty monitoring system is vital to obtaining an&#13;
accurate identification of the poor and in assessing the impact of poverty reduction&#13;
activities. The poverty monitoring component of the project would support the&#13;
establishment of an objective poverty monitoring system at the project level. The system&#13;
would provide a credible and comprehensive poverty profile for the project areas, track&#13;
input and process indicators and determine the impact of the project's individual&#13;
components. Furthermore, it would provide an important testing ground for assisting in&#13;
the establishment of a national poverty monitoring system. Project activities would build&#13;
on the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) existing survey instruments, with adjustments to&#13;
target project areas and to improve modules on both the individual and community level.&#13;
The four elements of the poverty monitoring system include: (a) upgrading SSB's rural&#13;
household survey; (b) carrying out pilot, baseline and annual follow-up surveys, (c)&#13;
processing and analyzing data collected, and (d) disseminating findings.&#13;
Existing Sources of Poverty Information&#13;
2.   In order to adequately identify the poor and to monitor changes in poverty, it is&#13;
important to have objective and accurate estimates of poverty incidence. Furthermore,&#13;
for policy purposes it is useful to have agreement on the extent and magnitude of&#13;
poverty. Unfortunately, estimates of poverty incidence vary greatly and much work has&#13;
yet to be done to establish reliable and comprehensive estimates of poverty. The major&#13;
sources of poverty information come from household surveys, community data gathering&#13;
mechanisms and institutional records.&#13;
Household Surveys&#13;
3.   The Rural Socioeconomic Survey (RSS) Administered by SSB. The SSB&#13;
administers a comprehensive rural household survey which covers 67,000 households in&#13;
857 counties of 30 provinces (cities). Survey design contains about 1,400 entries and&#13;
includes information on household demographics, assets, educational attainment,&#13;
ethnicity, production, income, expenditure and consumption. In practice, sample&#13;
households are trained to record daily changes. These household "accounts" or "diaries"&#13;
are collected monthly or quarterly by SSB. The collected information is then cleaned,&#13;
aggregated and computerized. SSB has a branch office in each province and 8,250 well-&#13;
trained full-time staff/enumerators, and 27,000 part-time enumerators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.   Ministry of Agriculture Household Surveys. The MOA, until the early 1990s,&#13;
administered household surveys to gather information on agricultural statistics such as&#13;
production, yield, and costs. Rural household income calculated did not include&#13;
remittance, transfers, gifts, or production for own-consumption. Consumption and&#13;
expenditure information was not included in the surveys.&#13;
Community Data Gathering and Institutional Records&#13;
5.   The Agricultural Statistics Division of Provincial Statistical Bureaus (PSB) gathers&#13;
information at the community level through its "Rural Socioeconomic Card". The&#13;
purpose of this card is to obtain information common to all households in a township or&#13;
administrative village, especially concerning access of the community to infrastructure&#13;
and social services (education, health and nutritional facilities). The card consists of&#13;
about two hundred entries covering geographic, ethnic, social and economic&#13;
characteristics, production areas, cropping, production, income, expenditure of major&#13;
agricultural activities and community access to social services. The card is comprised of&#13;
a set of pre-formatted tables that are aggregated when submitted from township up to&#13;
county level. The information is collected through several pre-existing sources. Most of&#13;
the community information such as total area of cultivated land, crop sown areas, and&#13;
agro-machinery utilization are gathered from AMS reports; marketed products and price&#13;
information come from local Industrial-Commerce Management Bureaus; health and&#13;
education data from respective bureaus, and others data is obtained from AMS and SSB&#13;
surveys. The major problem of the County Card system is its unreliability which is due&#13;
to its small sample size and the fact that sometimes results obtained are modified due to&#13;
political reasons. It is known that poverty profile and poverty lines based on the County&#13;
Card information are prone to subjectivity.&#13;
6.   Ad-hoc Data Gathering. Besides the above listed sources, important poverty&#13;
monitoring information can be obtained from records collected through various other&#13;
venus such as ad-hoc sectoral surveys, small surveys using nonprobability samples, case&#13;
studies, sociological and anthropological studies. Although these approaches do not&#13;
provide a systematic basis for monitoring poverty in the long-run, they provide important&#13;
information on the correlates of poverty while some of the above more formalized&#13;
approaches may not.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring &amp; Evaluation for the Project Area&#13;
7.   The project will establish for the project areas an objective poverty monitoring&#13;
system using improved survey instruments. The system would provide a credible and&#13;
comprehensive poverty profile for the project areas, analyze the accuracy of targeting&#13;
benefits to the absolute poor, and measure and evaluate the impact of the project's&#13;
individual components. Furthermore, it would provide a very useful testing ground for&#13;
the establishment of a national poverty monitoring system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -                            Annex 8&#13;
8.  In general, the most efficient way of establishing a poverty monitoring system is to&#13;
work with existing survey institutions and modify their instruments to fit project&#13;
purposes. Household surveys are the most reliable and appropriate for evaluating project&#13;
implementation. Because the SSB conducts the most extensive rural household survey&#13;
and because it is independent from the SWPRP, it should take the lead in monitoring&#13;
poverty in the project. However, the SSB's survey questionnaires should be modified&#13;
for specific project purposes. Furthermore, an unaggregated community level survey&#13;
administered by SSB at the administrative village level or township level should be used&#13;
to supplement the household survey. Community surveys should gather information on&#13;
the seasonal local labor market, labor mobility, local market prices, and access to social&#13;
services. The project would provide technical assistance to SSB to develop mechanisms&#13;
which would enhance survey consistency and reliability.&#13;
9.   The Pilot Survey ($20,000). While SSB's current rural survey reflects provincial&#13;
averages and the sample size is to small to give poverty county level information.&#13;
Hence, the extent and magnitudes of the absolute poor in these areas are little&#13;
understood. In order to obtain a poverty profile of the poorest individuals, the SSB&#13;
undertook a 600 household sample survey in September 1994. Given funding and timing&#13;
constraints, the pilot survey was conducted once. A simplified and extended version of&#13;
SSB's household survey was used which had fewer entries and obtained information on&#13;
household production, consumption, income, expenditures, education, health, labor&#13;
mobility, and credit experience. The results from the survey are summarized in Annex 2.&#13;
10. Baseline and Follow-up Surveys ($ 1 million). In order to obtain a poverty&#13;
profile of the project areas and to track project implementation progress, a baseline&#13;
survey would be implemented in 1995 with follow-up surveys to be conducted each&#13;
December during the remaining five years of the project. For the baseline survey,&#13;
approximately 4,000 sample households from project areas will be surveyed enabling&#13;
average per capita income estimates to be within Â±5 percent. For the follow-up&#13;
surveys, the sample size would be about 2000 households. All the baseline sample&#13;
households will be interviewed again in year 2000 to evaluate overall project impact.&#13;
11.  A three-stage sampling method would be used. Instead of stratifying the sample&#13;
administratively, namely, county-township-village and then households, it would be more&#13;
cost-effective if the project areas are first stratified into Guangxi-Guizhou karst area and&#13;
Guizhou-Yunnan Plateau. Villages and households can be chosen from each primary&#13;
unit. In any case, sample size for each sub-unit can be calculated.&#13;
12.  Questionnaires would be designed, tested and modified in the first half of 1995&#13;
followed by staff training, discussions and workshops. Based on lessons learned from the&#13;
pilot survey, the baseline and follow-up survey would employ the "diary" or the account&#13;
book method currently used by the SSB. This method generally minimizes biases due to&#13;
memory lapses because income and expenditures are recorded daily. After each survey&#13;
is implemented, the information would be processed, and LGPR and SSB would&#13;
collaborate on the publication of an annual report.&#13;

13.  At present, SSB is planning on establishing a nation-wide poverty monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system. In its proposal, SSB intends to overhaul its current survey&#13;
instruments to make them more compatible with the Living Standard Measurement&#13;
Survey (LSMS). If SSB's proposal can get funded, the project's baseline and follow-up&#13;
surveys can be incorporated into the overall monitoring system for comparative purpose.&#13;
14.  Institutional Records and Ad-hoc Surveys. Finally, as mentioned in the&#13;
proceeding section, institutional records and information collected through ad-hoc&#13;
surveys are vital inputs to effective poverty reduction. It is critical that the project make&#13;
use of these resources. For example, health center records compiled by each level of&#13;
health administrative offices and primary education records maintained by local&#13;
education offices can provide useful information (immunization rates, repetition and&#13;
drop-out rates, etc) for poverty monitoring which is not captured in the household&#13;
surveys. Of importance to note is that the Women's Federation has gathered important&#13;
information on women and various research institutions and universities have also&#13;
undertaken data collection and information gathering on the poverty issues.&#13;

Pilot Survey Summary&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   The objective of the pilot survey was to provide a clearer understanding of the&#13;
poverty profile of the absolute poor households in the project areas. A survey of 600&#13;
households in project areas was completed on October 10, 1994. The survey gathered&#13;
information at the community, household and individual level. It built upon the State&#13;
Statistical Bureau's (SSB) existing rural household survey and included simplified&#13;
questions on income, consumption, and expenditure and added entries concerning&#13;
education, health and labor mobility.&#13;
Household Survey Parameters&#13;
2.   Coverage and Scope. Data was collected on household consumption&#13;
expenditure, income, socio-economic and demographic characteristics. To capture&#13;
variations among the absolute poor, a three-stage sampling method was used. Within&#13;
each province, two relatively well-off and two worse-off project counties were&#13;
identified. Then the two poorest villages in the poorest township of the selected&#13;
county were selected. Within each of those villages, 25 of the poorest households&#13;
were enumerated. Survey location and coverage is shown in Table 1.&#13;

3.    Household Definition. A household may consist of a person with separate&#13;
accommodations and cooking arrangements or a group of persons who normally live and eat&#13;
together and consider the living quarters or space occupied by them as their usual place of&#13;
residence. These persons may be family members and others who live and eat with the&#13;
household with or without payment for more than six months. Family members are defined&#13;
as husband, wife, unmarried sons and daughters, and other direct dependent such as parents,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
unmarried sisters, brothers, divorced sisters or daughters. A family member who was absent&#13;
for more than six months was not included in the household.&#13;
4.    Household income refers to gross available income and includes: (a) income from all&#13;
household production (agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery) valued at market&#13;
prices; (b) handicraft or off-farm earnings; (c) social insurance benefits including government&#13;
relief transfers and pensions for five guaranteed households; and (d) income from other&#13;
sources, including gifts and remittances. All household expenditure includes purchases of all&#13;
production inputs, food, clothing, health care, education, and other consumption goods and&#13;
services. Payments made by households other than for consumption were considered as other&#13;
disbursements. Household expenditure also included income taxes, collective levies, gifts to&#13;
others, interest payment, investments and depreciation, and so on.&#13;

5.    All sample villages were located in the mountainous karst or upland areas. An&#13;
average village (administrative village) has 352 households and 1,650 individuals. The total&#13;
sample population is 2,804, including 1,595 adult laborers (age 16 to 64), 138 elderly (age&#13;
65 and above), 745 school age children (age 6 to 15), and 326 young children age less than&#13;
6. The frequency distribution of the households by family size is shown in Chart 1. On&#13;
average, there are 4.7 persons per household, of which at least two are dependents. Males&#13;
and females account for 53 percent and 47 percent of the sample population respectively.&#13;
Among the sample population, Han, Miao, and Zhuang account of 22 percent, 35 percent&#13;
and 40 percent respectively. The remaining 3 percent consists of Yi, Bai, and other&#13;
minorities.&#13;

6.    Among these village communities, per capita grain production was 110.5 kg, and per&#13;
capita net income (PCNI) was Y152. The variations of the PCNI at village level can be&#13;
shown in Chart 2. Note that PCNI for village of Qiaojia in Yunnan was only Y57. The&#13;
large variations of PCNI among these villages indicated that the use of local market prices&#13;
could be problematic. Since the own-consumption portion of the income was evaluated at&#13;

local market prices, it is a downward biased estimation of the PCNI in the isolated poor&#13;
areas where local market prices are relatively low. Among these villages, 64 percent have&#13;
roads, 54 percent have electricity and 30 percent have telephone lines (built by Food for&#13;
Work and poverty alleviation programs).&#13;

HIousehold Findings&#13;
7.    Assets. None of those surveyed lived in brick homes (all lived in mud-huts, bamboo-&#13;
huts, or the like). Among the 600 households, only two had television sets, 3 percent of the&#13;
hlouseholds had radio, 4 percent had bicycles, and 6 percent had sewing machines. An&#13;
average household had 4.6 mu of land, of which only 0.33 mu was irrigated. Seventy-eight&#13;
percent of the land was planted with food crops. Fifty-four percent of the households could&#13;
not afford cattle-raising. On average, these households raise one goat, two pigs, and 4 to 5&#13;
chickens.&#13;
8.    Facilities. About 68 percent of the households did not have a toilet of any kind; 64&#13;
percent did not have any electricity; 35 percent drew their drinking water from water ponds,&#13;
rivers or lakes, and 30 percent from all sorts of wells. Ninety-seven percent of the&#13;
households used wood and grass for fuel.&#13;
9.    Income. The main sources of income include: crops (Y578), livestock (Y293),&#13;
remittances from migrant laborer(s) (Y104), and others (Y150). After deducting all the&#13;
expenses accordingly, the net household annual income was Y710, which made average&#13;
per capita annual net income (PCNI)less than Y152.&#13;

10.   Rural Credit. The average household borrowed Y307 annually, Y256 in cash, and&#13;
the rest in kind. Forty-eight percent of Y307 was borrowed from friends and relatives, 22&#13;
percent from RCC, and 8 percent from informal rural credit systems. About 25 percent of&#13;
the households did not borrow money during the past year; 50 percent borrowed 1-2 times;&#13;
and the rest borrowed at least 3 times. Fifty percent borrowed on one year term. About 50&#13;
percent paid back in cash, and 21 percent defaulted (it seemed RCC never got their loans&#13;
repaid). Average cash and grain saving per household were about Y35 and 178 kg&#13;
respectively.&#13;
11.   Social Security. Eighty percent of the "Five Guaranteed Households" and childless&#13;
elderly persons did not receive care from any one, and 10 percent received aid from the&#13;
government.1/ On average, sample households received Y10 and 13 kg relieve grain from&#13;
the government.&#13;
12.   Agriculture Extension and Training. Ninety-eight percent of the households had&#13;
never received any extension services or training. Forty-one percent would like to receive&#13;
training on cropping technologies, and 31 percent on tree crop technologies.&#13;
Overview of Findings on Individual Characteristics&#13;
Education&#13;
13.   Adult Literacy. For sample adults (age 16 and above), the illiteracy rate is 56&#13;
percent. Seventy-five percent of the adult population has less than six years of primary&#13;
school education. Only 1.5 percent obtained post-secondary education. On average, Bai and&#13;
Miao minorities have the least education attainment - less than 3 years of primary education.&#13;
14.   School Age Children. Among the 745 school age children, the male-female ratio is&#13;
0.51/0.49. During the past six months, the average enrollment rate was 55 percent, with&#13;
64.6 percent among boys, and 45 percent among girls. About 39 percent of the cohort have&#13;
never enrolled, and 60 percent of them are girls. Among children aged 10 to 15, only 15&#13;
percent of girls and 27 percent of boys received more than 4 years of basic education.&#13;
Among children aged 13 to 15, 20 percent of the boys and 5 percent of the girls graduated&#13;
from primary school. For those who did not enroll or dropped out, poverty was the main&#13;
(78 percent) cause.&#13;
I/    'Five-Guarantee" households are households which in principlo are guaranteed food, clothing,&#13;
housing, medical care and burial by collective funds. However, in most of the poor areas, communities&#13;
rarely have adequate funds for these households. Therefore, these household have relied on state relief&#13;
grains or funds.&#13;

Health&#13;
15.   Poverty and Health. Ninety percent of the population cannot afford medical fees;&#13;
21 percent of the population would not go to a doctor when they are ill mainly (97 percent)&#13;
because they do not have money. About 54 percent of those who would seek treatment when&#13;
ill have to go to township clinics that are located on average more than 4 km away, due to&#13;
the lack of facilities at village level.&#13;
16.   Women of Reproductive Age. The frequency of women in reproductive age by&#13;
number of living children they have can be shown in Table 2. About 85 percent and 48&#13;
percent of the womnen have given birth to at least two and three children, respectively. The&#13;
under-five mortality rate is 6.4 percent. About 93 percent of those died were less than 12&#13;
months old. At least 90 percent of the women gave birth to their youngest child at home,&#13;
and less than 3 percent went to either village or township clinics. About 84 percent of the&#13;
women delivered babies either by themselves or with the help of family members. Ten&#13;
percent were helped by neighbors or mid-wives, and less than 5 percent received professional&#13;
help.&#13;

17.   Children Under Five. The frequency distribution of average height and weight by&#13;
sex for children unlder five is shown in Table 2. The average weight and height in each age&#13;
cohort are between -2SD and -3SD, compared to the standards for height and weight&#13;
recommended by WHO for each age group. The height measurement of children under five&#13;
is not very accurate due to the difficulties of getting the measurement board up the hill in&#13;
most villages.&#13;
Labor&#13;
18.   Number of Migrants. During the past year, about 12 percent of adults held jobs&#13;
outside the community (migrant laborers) for various lengths of time. Fifty-five percent of&#13;
&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
migrant laborers worked outside the community between 1 to 4 months; 12 percent between&#13;
5-6 months; and 33 percent resided outside the community for more than 6 months (in fact,&#13;
about 21 percent stayed outside at least one year) - an indication of finding more stable jobs&#13;
among these people. Chart 3 shows that the number of migrants per household is positively&#13;
related to the family size. As the family size increases, more adults would leave home.&#13;
19.   Migrant Characteristics. On average, migrant laborers had higher educational&#13;
attainment. At least 51 percent were primary school graduates and 22 percent completed 3-4&#13;
grades of primary education. About 85 percent of the migrant laborers are male.&#13;
20.   Employment and Remittances. Among those migrant laborers, 87 percent went&#13;
beyond county boundaries; 77 percent still engaged in agricultural activities, and slightly&#13;
more than 5 percent worked in construction activities. Among all the migrant laborers, 61&#13;
percent found jobs by themselves, and 20 percent through networks of friends and relatives.&#13;
More than 62 percent of migranit laborers sent remittance home, varying from once a year to&#13;
once a month. The average remittance sent home was about Y104. About 47 percent sent&#13;
less than YIOO home, 22 percent sent between Y100-200, 12 percent between Y200-300, and&#13;
the rest (19 percent) sent more than Y300 home.&#13;

CHINA: Southwest Poverty Reduction Project&#13;
Proposed Bank Group Supervision Input&#13;
Vision of a Community at Project Full Development&#13;
1.    After project completion, average annual per capita income in a typical project&#13;
community would increase to more than the nationally defined absolute poverty line of Y 320&#13;
(in constant 1992 prices). Through the establishment and reconstruction of village teaching&#13;
points, primary school enrollment and completion rates would approximate the provincial&#13;
averages of that time. The existing village health care clinic would be strengthened or, if&#13;
none existed, one would be built. Each clinic would receive at least one new village health&#13;
aide and salary increments would be provided to qualified health aides. Infant mortality rates&#13;
would be reduced from more than 10 percent at present to no more than 5 percent at full&#13;
development, and the maternal mortality ratio would be reduced by more than 30 percent.&#13;
Safe drinking water would be provided to at least 25 percent of the total number of project&#13;
beneficiaries, thus reducing diarrheal and water-related diseases and decreasing the time and&#13;
labor women are required to spend supplying water for their families and livestock.&#13;
2.    Improvements in the social sectors would be matched by increases in employment&#13;
opportunities, infrastructure and agriculture production techniques. At least 10 percent of&#13;
project villagers would gain access to off-farm employment opportunities through the project.&#13;
About 30 percent of all administrative villages would be connected by a basic (Class IV) road&#13;
to the existing network of county roads. About 70 percent of households in 21 percent of&#13;
project villages would benefit by electrification schemes. The village would most likely have&#13;
access to one of the 76 strategically placed farmers markets which would provide affordable&#13;
inputs and profitable outlets for products. In four out of five households, one member would&#13;
master one or two new farming skills. Terracing, improvement of low-yield fields, and&#13;
extension programs would be main factors contributing to expected yield increases of about&#13;
38 percent for corn, 46 percent for potato, and 107 percent for fodder. Most project&#13;
households would take part in the planting and maintenance of tree and bush species on&#13;
steeply sloped hillsides and wastelands, and about 30 percent of project households would&#13;
undertake animal breeding and fattening activities. The capacity of village organizations to&#13;
strategize and to manage their own resources would be strengthened through the development&#13;
and use of a participatory (including women and minorities) integrated village development&#13;
planning system.&#13;

            China - Southwest Poverty Reduction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the
            Southwest Poverty Reduction Project are to: 1) demonstrate
            the effectiveness of a focused, multisectoral rural
            development project approach to poverty reduction; 2)
            facilitate a "market-friendly" increase in labor
            mobility from the poor areas to better-off rural and rapidly
            growing urban areas; 3) upgrade poverty monitoring at the
            national and local levels; and 4) significantly reduce
            absolute poverty in 35 of the very poorest counties in
            southwestern China. The project will comprise the following
            six components: 1) social services, including increasing the
            access and quality of primary education and enhancing the
            availability and delivery of primary and curative health
            care; 2) labor mobility, through a voluntary system of
            enhanced rural labor mobility for the upland absolute poor;
            3) rural infrastructure, including the labor-intensive
            construction of rural roads, safe drinking water supply
            systems, small-scale irrigation, agricultural drainage
            works, biogas digesters, and rural electrification; 4) land
            and farmer development, using menus of crop and livestock
            activities to increase upland agricultural productivity and
            reverse the trend of environmental degradation; 5) Township
            and Village Enterprise (TVE) development, through support
            for TVEs consisting of investment credit for
            labor-intensive, mineral, service and handicraft industries;
            and 6) institution building and poverty monitoring.
