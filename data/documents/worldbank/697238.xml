THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
1. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Economic Reform&#13;
1.1   Although Honduras experienced some economic progress over the last two&#13;
decades, per capita GNP remains low at an estimated US $580 in 1993. One-third of the&#13;
population of 5.5 million still lives in extreme poverty and 80 percent of the poor live in&#13;
rural areas. With the level of poverty closely linked to average wages, particularly in rural&#13;
areas, the country's economic performance is of primary importance to improving the&#13;
poverty ratios. However, in recent years, this performance has fluctuated considerably.&#13;
1.2    Until recently, Honduras' development strategy was based on import substitution,&#13;
protected by high tariff barriers and extensive Government intervention. This resulted in a&#13;
large and inefficient public sector and serious structural imbalances in the economy. By&#13;
the end of 1989, the parallel exchange rate was twice the official rate, external arrears&#13;
amounted to US$620 million, and the country had been cut off from international&#13;
creditors. Starting in 1990, the Government successfully implemented a stabilization and&#13;
adjustment program, complemented by a series of sectoral reform programs. Combined&#13;
with a tightening of fiscal controls in early- 1991, these reforms began to show positive&#13;
results during the second half of 1991. In 1992, GDP growth increased, inflation fell to&#13;
the lowest level since 1987, and the current account deficit improved. Arrears with the&#13;
multilateral and bilateral institutions were cleared by mid-1990, after which point&#13;
Honduras was declared eligible for IDA credits on the basis of its heavy indebtedness and&#13;
low income level. In September 1991, Honduras was reclassified as an exclusively IDA&#13;
country.&#13;
1.3   However, the promising economic trends of 1991-1992 were not sustained in&#13;
1993. As the elections approached, the fiscal deficit, which was targeted to fall to 3.8&#13;
percent of GDP in 1993, reached over 10 percent. Inflationary pressure began to build up,&#13;
and foreign exchange reserves were depleted. The Government, which took office in&#13;
January 1994, thus inherited serious fiscal and balance of payments problems, but is&#13;
committed to the resumption of sustainable economic growth through the implementation&#13;
of a medium-term program that aims to: (a) reduce the fiscal deficit; (b) reform the public&#13;
sector by reducing its size and increasing its efficiency; (c) reform the judicial system; (d)&#13;
restructure the social security system to eliminate the existing financial deficit; (e) privatize&#13;
selected public enterprises; (f) reduce the number of tax exemptions, and (g) strengthen&#13;
tax administration. At the same time, the Government intends to maintain the present&#13;
level of social expenditures in the face of fiscal austerity, and continue its program of&#13;
poverty alleviation and human resource development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B. Poverty Reduction&#13;
1.4   The conclusions of a joint Bank-IDB Public Investment Review mission in&#13;
November/December 1994 confirm that substantial social expenditures will continue to be&#13;
required to help improve the country's poor social indicators, including an illiteracy rate&#13;
for the adult population of 32 percent (reaching over 42 percent in rural areas), a total&#13;
fertility rate of 4.5 per woman of child bearing age, a maternal mortality rate of 221 per&#13;
100,000 live births, an infant mortality rate of 45 per 1,000 live births, and malnutrition&#13;
affecting 46 percent of children under five. (More detail is provided in Annex 1.)&#13;
1.5    Although Honduras has made considerable progress in improving education in&#13;
recent decades, particularly at the primary school level, it still experiences major problems&#13;
related to quality, efficiency, and equity, including overcrowded and dilapidated physical&#13;
facilities and limited school access. More than one-third of the rural primary schools are&#13;
incomplete, i.e., they cover only the first three or four grades of instruction. As a result,&#13;
there are still 70,000 children with no access to full primary education, predominantly in&#13;
rural areas of extreme poverty and geographic isolation. According to recent data from&#13;
the Ministry of Education (MOE), there is a need, over the next four years, for about&#13;
3,200 additional classrooms, as well as for the repair and rehabilitation of about 11,800&#13;
existing classrooms, meaning a total investment of about US$61 million,' excluding the&#13;
cost of furniture and supplies.&#13;
1.6    Health and nutrition indicators also reflect the acute problems still facing the poor:&#13;
i.adequate diets lack of sanitation, deficient coverage of the primary health care system,&#13;
ignorance about hygiene, correct nutritional practices, and preventive health care. Infant&#13;
and matemal mortality are much higher in rural areas, and are subject to wide regional&#13;
variations. For example, in three of the poorest regions of the country, maternal mortality&#13;
is estimated at above 340 per 1 00,000. Nutritional deficiencies are a contributing factor in&#13;
about 60 percent of infant deaths. By the time they enter primary school, the growth of 35&#13;
percent of children is stunted. Undernutrition is also a major health problem of pregnant&#13;
and nursing women: over half the women attending health centers suffered from mild or&#13;
moderate anemia and vitamin A deficiency. According to recent data from the Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH), primary health care still does not reach about 20 percent of the&#13;
population. This would require, inter alia an investment in new health centers, as well as&#13;
in repairing and rehabilitating existing centers, of about US$3 million. This amount, too,&#13;
excludes furniture and supplies.&#13;
1.7    The provision of water and basic sanitation is highly inefficient and biased in favor&#13;
of urban areas. Although about 70 percent of the population -- 90 percent of the&#13;
population in urban areas and 54 percent in rural areas -- has access to a water supply&#13;
system, treatment is deficient, and only 17 percent of the population has safe water. In&#13;
About US$6.2 million for 290 classrooms is provided for under the Basic Education Project (see para.&#13;
1.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
addition, those who have no access, mainly the poor, pay up to 77 times as much for&#13;
water as those who have access. To correct this, and to provide access to an additional&#13;
300,000 families in rural areas alone, would cost at least US$27 million. In addition, there&#13;
is a need for major investment in basic sanitation. Sewerage covers only 25 percent of the&#13;
population, concentrated in urban areas. Waste removal in most of the country, covering&#13;
about 37 percent of the population, is handled through latrines. For latrines alone, there is&#13;
a need for more than 50,000 new and replacement ones yearly, estimated to cost about&#13;
US$25 million over a four-year period.&#13;
C. Government Strategy&#13;
1.8   The Government has a clear understanding of the social needs, and is assigning&#13;
high priority to overcoming the country's education and health problems. However,&#13;
although Government spending in education and health amounted to about 7 percent of&#13;
GDP, corresponding to about one-third of central government spending over the period&#13;
1985 - 92, inefficiency ard inequity of spending have been ongoing problems. The&#13;
Government is making an effort to strengthen the project planning and implementation&#13;
capacity of the responsible ministries and agencies, but in the meantime, considers its&#13;
social safety net programs of critical importance. The Honduran Social Investment Fund&#13;
(FHIS) and the Family Assistance Program (PRAF) were both established in 1990, and&#13;
targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable groups; FHIS to generate emergency&#13;
employment and to build and rehabilitate small-scale infrastructure quickly and efficiently,&#13;
and PRAF to provide food coupons to poor, pregnant and nursing women, children under&#13;
five, and primary school children in departments with the highest malnutrition rates. Both&#13;
programs have been quite successful, and have become the conduit for substantial donor&#13;
support. Until the line ministries have overcome ongoing weaknesses in procurement,&#13;
disbursement, civil service systems, and planning and budgeting, the Government wishes&#13;
FHIS to complement the ministries' activities. FHIS will have the authority to manage the&#13;
implementation of small and medium-scale subprojects, while the ministries will focus on&#13;
policy and norm setting, as well as monitoring and evaluation responsibilities.&#13;
D. Bank and IDA Support&#13;
1.9   The social sector has received, and will receive, considerable Bank and IDA&#13;
support. MOE efforts to improve the efficiency of service delivery were assisted through&#13;
the Administration of Rural Primary Education Management Project (Ln. 2804-HO in&#13;
1987; US$4.4 million), followed by the recently-approved Basic Education Project&#13;
(Cr.2694-HO in 1995; US$30 million). The latter aims to improve primary school student&#13;
academic achievement levels, to reduce high repetition rates, to provide for bilingual&#13;
instruction in primary grades, and to improve sector management efficiency. In health and&#13;
nutrition, the Nutrition and Health Project (Cr. 2452-HO in 1993; US $25 million) assists&#13;
PRAF in improving the nutrition status of children and pregnant and nursing women&#13;
among the poorest segments of the population, supports the development and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
implementation of a longer-term nutrition assistance strategy, helps to improve the quality&#13;
of services provided by MOH and to control the spread of AIDS, and assists in&#13;
strengthening the institutional capacity of MOH and PRAF for sector planning, program&#13;
formulation, monitoring and evaluation, as well as for the procurement of drugs. A&#13;
proposed joint IDA-IDB Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Adjustment Project,&#13;
expected to be appraised in mid-1995, would help improve the water supply and sanitation&#13;
policy environment, and an ongoing sector study, funded by the Bank and UNDP, would&#13;
provide much useful information on water and sanitation sector needs (see Annex 8). The&#13;
recently-approved Environmental Development Project (Cr.2693-HO in 1995; US$10.8&#13;
million) aims to strengthen the capacity of the State Secretariat of Environment (SEDA)&#13;
and key sector agencies in environmental and land use planning, policy development, and&#13;
development of a sound legal and regulatory framework; to develop the capacity to carry&#13;
out environmental impact assessments and audits, to monitor for environmental quality&#13;
and environmentally sustainable resource use, and to enforce environmental laws and&#13;
regulations; and finally to develop the capacity of selected municipalities and local&#13;
conmmunities for environmental management, as well as to identify, design, and implement&#13;
priority small-scale environmental investments. The implementing capacity of MOE and&#13;
MOH would also be improved under the proposed joint IDA-IDB Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Project, which is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors in&#13;
September 1995, and with the assistance of a recent IDF grant in the amount of&#13;
US$198,000 for Institutional Development of Social Sector Ministries.&#13;
1.10  Under all of the above recently-approved projects, the civil works components are&#13;
being managed by FHIS, including US$5.4 million under the Nutrition and Health Project,&#13;
US$6.2 million under the Basic Education Project, and US$2.9 million under the&#13;
Environmental Development Project. Under the Environmental Development Project,&#13;
FHIS is also receiving US$0.7 million for incremental operating expenditures and the&#13;
adrninistration of environmental subprojects. FHIS has been directly supported under the&#13;
First and Second Social Investment Fund (SIF) Projects (Cr. 2212 - HO in 1991; US$20&#13;
million and Cr. 2401-HO in 1992; US$10.2 million), which both aimed to help protect and&#13;
improve the standard of living of marginal social groups in both rural and urban areas&#13;
through the provision of employment and improved services, mainly through the financing&#13;
of labor-intensive social infrastructure subprojects. The Government has now asked that&#13;
various donors, including IDA, IDB, and KfW, continue to assist FHIS in addressing&#13;
poverty alleviation through priority subprojects at the municipal and community level.&#13;
E. Rationale for ]IDA Involvement&#13;
1.11  Continued assistance to FHIS is consistent with the Bank Group's country&#13;
assistance strategy for Honduras, which was discussed by the Board in August 1993 in&#13;
conjunction with the presentation of the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (P-5923-&#13;
HO of July 14, 1993). This strategy aims at reducing poverty, modernizing the economy&#13;
and the public sector, and prudently managing the country's natural resources. An OED&#13;
Performance Audit Report (No. 13839, December 30, 1994) on the two IDA credits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
supporting FHIS confirmed that FHIS has succeeded in producing a large number of&#13;
small, widely-dispersed projects targeted to the poor. Further IDA involvement would be&#13;
critical to help the Government mobilize additional resources for poverty alleviation to&#13;
accompany its economic reform program. FHIS would serve as a powerful mechanism to&#13;
mobilize and coordinate donor assistance for the social sectors. Equally important, the&#13;
Country Economic Memorandum/Poverty Assessment (No. 13317 of November 17, 1994)&#13;
stated that FHIS has had a significantly positive impact on the development of small-scale&#13;
infrastructure, as well as upon improving the implementation capacity of small private&#13;
construction firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and municipalities,&#13;
strengthening their institutional capacity, and laying the groundwork for decentralization.&#13;
2. HONDURAN SOCLAL INVESTMENT FUND&#13;
A. Background&#13;
(1) Objectives&#13;
2.1   FHIS was established in 1990 as a temporary agency, part of the Government's&#13;
response to the potentially serious impact of the economic adjustment program on the&#13;
country's poor. Through the financing of a large number of subprojects in social and&#13;
economic infrastructure, social services, and informal sector activities, FHIS aimed to&#13;
generate emergency employment, and to protect and improve the standard of living in&#13;
poor communities.&#13;
2.2   Recognizing the success of FHIS as an institution that has become a key element in&#13;
implementing the Government's poverty alleviation strategy, the Government recently&#13;
extended its mandate to 12 years. Under this new mandate, it is expected that FHIS will&#13;
continue to play an important role over the medium term as the implementing arm of the&#13;
line ministries in the management of critical small and medium-scale social and economic&#13;
infrastructure subprojects, as well as in the funding of priority programs in basic needs,&#13;
until those ministries have overcome the weaknesses mentioned in para. 1.8.&#13;
(2) Approach&#13;
2.3   Subprojects. FHIS finances subprojects in accordance with eligibility criteria and&#13;
evaluation parameters established in its Operational Manuals, which have recently been&#13;
updated, and which will be further revised under the proposed project. Investments have&#13;
been financed in the areas outlined below, according to a standardized menu of&#13;
subprojects:2&#13;
2 The menu and categorization of subprojects (particularly in the Basic Needs program) will be updated&#13;
under the proposed project (see para 3.6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
(a)    Social and Economic Infrastructure: This program includes (i)&#13;
rehabilitation, maintenance, and expansion of preprimary, primary, and&#13;
junior secondary schools, health centers, and water and sanitation systems,&#13;
as well as maintenance of rural roads; (ii) simple works such as repair and&#13;
construction of canals and ditches, and construction of bridges, gutters and&#13;
sidewalks; and (iii) rehabilitation of archeological and historical sites aimed&#13;
at the preservation of cultural heritage and ethnic minorities.&#13;
(b)    Basic Needs: This program provides funding for priority social programs&#13;
such as nutrition, childcare, training of midwives and other health workers,&#13;
care for the elderly and disabled, and school and health center furniture and&#13;
teaching materials.&#13;
(c)    Micro Credit:. Under the Program of Support for the Informal Sector&#13;
(Programa de Apoyo al Sector Inlformal - PASI), FHIS makes funds&#13;
available to NGOs for on-lending at market rates to help establish and&#13;
expand small and micro-enterprises in the productive sectors. Terms and&#13;
conditions for financing of informal sector subprojects are spelled out in the&#13;
Operational Manuals.3&#13;
2.4    Targeting. Several mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that subprojects&#13;
are properly targeted to the poor. First, FHIS allocates its funds on the basis of a poverty&#13;
map, ranking all 18 departments and 293 municipalities of the country based on&#13;
population, and adjusted for levels of child malnutrition and access to potable water and&#13;
basic sanitation. These indicators have been used to produce a departmental and&#13;
municipal index of poverty and to assign additional resources to the poorest departments&#13;
and municipalities. The formula is currently being revised, and, starting as of 1996, the&#13;
formula will also include illiteracy, and be adjusted for differentials in the cost of materials&#13;
across departments. (More detail is provided in Annex 2.) Second, FIUS' emphasis on&#13;
social infrastructure and social sectors, and its concentration on subprojects with the&#13;
highest social return (primary education, primary health care, and water and sanitation)&#13;
also contribute to the proper targeting of funds toward the poor. Third, wages paid on&#13;
FHIS-financed subprojects are aligned with the market rate for unskilled labor, to ensure&#13;
participation of individuals in the lowest deciles of the income scale. Finally, FHIS makes&#13;
special efforts to ensure that its targeting goals are attained, including the use of&#13;
subproject eligibility criteria, promotion in poorer areas, and technical assistance to those&#13;
who lack project preparation capacity.&#13;
2.5    Sponsors. As shown in Table 1, subproject financing can be requested by&#13;
government ministries, municipalities, NGOs, and community groups. The subprojects are&#13;
3 A separate program funded by the European Development Fund (EDF), the Program of Credit and&#13;
Technical Assistance for Rural Micro-enterprises (Programa de Credito y Asistencia Tecnica a la&#13;
Microempresa Rural - PROCATMER), provides credit for rural microenterprises. PROCATMER&#13;
also lends through NGOs, but operates independently of FHIS management and has a codirector&#13;
appointed and paid by the EDF. PASI. too, is now being reorganized to operate independently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
executed by private sector contractors or NGOs, and supervised by FHIS or a third party&#13;
with the necessary technical qualifications. Subject to the municipal allocations, F-US&#13;
evaluates each subproject based on a site inspection, strict cost specifications, and social&#13;
benefits in accordance with its Operational Manuals agreed upon with IDA.&#13;

2.6   Institutional and Managerial Aspects. FHIS was created by law of February&#13;
22, 1990, with an initial life span of three years. On April 1, 1994, the FHIS mandate was&#13;
extended for two more years, and on December 24, 1994, until the year 2002. In addition&#13;
to stipulating FHIS' life span, the law specifies that FHIS: (a) is to be a financing, and not&#13;
an executing, entity; (b) is subject to external audits; and (c) uses special streamlined&#13;
procedures for public contracting.&#13;
2.7   The continued operation of FHIS has been declared a high priority by the President&#13;
of the Republic. Clearly, FHIS has solid support at all levels of the Government, and is&#13;
given priority by government agencies. FHIS has a Board of 10 members, chaired by the&#13;
President of the Republic, and including top government and congressional officials and&#13;
representatives of the private sector, cooperatives, and NGOs. It meets quarterly to: (a)&#13;
approve general policies and rules of operation; (b) approve the annual budget (once a&#13;
year); (c) authorize FHIS to negotiate loans; and (d) review FLIS' performance.&#13;
Subproject approval is left to the operations committee, which is headed by the FHIS&#13;
Executive Director and includes key FHIS department directors. The current Executive&#13;
Director, who comes from the private sector, was appointed in early 1994, and has the&#13;
rank of cabinet minister.&#13;
2.8   Following a recent organizational restructuring, FHIS is now organized into five&#13;
main departments: Projects, Legal, Control and Supervision, Planning, and&#13;
Administration. (See Annex 3 for the new organization chart.) A new Deputy Executive&#13;
Director assists the Executive Director with day-to-day operations and line manages the&#13;
support units, including the newly formed environment and community participation&#13;
advisory units; she was Vice Minister of Planning, and will contribute to the effort to&#13;
ensure that FHIS' activities meet the macro and sector priority criteria. As of March 31,&#13;
1995, FHIS had a total staff of 305, of whom 134 were professionals, including civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
engineers, economists, sociologists, credit specialists, computer engineers, and other&#13;
technical specialists. Most department heads have graduate degrees, and their competence&#13;
is comparable to the highest levels in the public sector.&#13;
(3) Achievements&#13;
2.9   Subproject Processing. As of January 1,1995, FHIS had approved 5,793&#13;
subprojects for a total of about US$121.7 million. As of the same date, a total of 976&#13;
subprojects were in execution, with 4,817 completed. The average subproject size of&#13;
about US$21,000 is comparable to the size of subprojects in other social investment funds&#13;
in the region. On average, informal sector (credit) subprojects have been considerably&#13;
larger.&#13;
2.10   Operational Efficiency. In general, FHIS has been able to process and approve&#13;
subprojects rapidly and efficiently. Average time of subproject processing, from reception&#13;
of a formulated project request to approval, has been about two months. FFHS-financed&#13;
subprojects have also been implemented reasonably well. The average implementation&#13;
period for FHIS subprojects has been about 6-9 months, depending upon the sector and&#13;
type of project.&#13;
2.11  Total FHIS administrative costs have represented about 10 percent of total&#13;
investments. This figure seems reasonable based on the number of subprojects processed&#13;
and their average cost; it is also consistent with the administrative costs in other regional&#13;
social investment funds.&#13;
2.12   Sectoral Accomplishments. FHIS has had a significant development impact by&#13;
acting quickly and providing infrastructure of generally good quality. By January 1, 1995,&#13;
FHIS had provided financing for the construction or refurbishing of 4,925 school&#13;
classrooms (20 percent of all classrooms in the country), 372 health centers (41 percent of&#13;
all health centers); and 84,246 latrines (34 percent of all latrines), and had provided access&#13;
to drinking water and sanitation systems to 88,700 and 467,000 people, respectively.&#13;
FHIS' basic needs program had provided 335,526 school desks (68 percent of the total),&#13;
as well as training for 4,632 midwives (about 70 percent of the total). It is also expected&#13;
that FHIS' efforts in basic sanitation subprojects will have a major long-term impact on&#13;
health, especially on infant and child mortality. They have helped contain the propagation&#13;
of cholera and lower the incidence of diarrhea, especially in the southern departments and&#13;
in the densely populated poor areas in the outskirts of major cities. Because of its special&#13;
procedures, higher quality of operations, promotion, technical assistance, and beneficiaries'&#13;
involvement, FHIS has delivered quickly a much larger program than the line ministries&#13;
could have done with the same budget, since they do not have the institutional capacity to&#13;
plan, implement, and supervise a high volume of decentralized infrastructure subprojects.&#13;
2.13  As shown in Table 2 below, the largest share of FHIS financing went to social and&#13;
economic infrastructure--75 percent of commitments from 1990 to January 1, 1995,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
compared to a 67% target at appraisal of SIF 2. The vast majority of this has been in&#13;
social infrastructure projects, including construction, expansion, and rehabilitation of&#13;
primary and preprimary schools, health centers, and water and sewerage systems; this&#13;
result confirms FHIS' commitment to supporting infrastructure projects with a high social&#13;
return. Other infrastructure subprojects included the areas of drainage, road construction&#13;
and repair, markets, and other community facilities. The basic needs program received 18&#13;
percent of FHIS financing--a share close to the appraisal target of 22 percent; the school&#13;
desks program has accounted for about three-fifths of this total (see para. 2.12). Micro&#13;
credit subprojects account for about 7 percent of total commitments, compared to an&#13;
appraisal target of 11 percent.&#13;

Source: FHIS, January 1995.&#13;
2.14   Employment Generated. Through 1994, FHIS subprojects generated&#13;
approximately 689,000 person-months of temporary employment, equivalent to about&#13;
57,000 person-years, at an average cost per employee-year of US$2,120, a cost that is in&#13;
line with other social funds in Latin America.4 Credit programs are estimated to have&#13;
created about 24,000 additional person-years of employment of a more permanent nature.&#13;
Although these figures are small as percentages of the total labor force, representing only&#13;
about 1 percent on an annualized basis, they are more significant as percentages of open&#13;
unemployment, representing 20 to 30 percent per year.&#13;
2.15   Institutional Impact. FHIS has had a positive impact on the institutional&#13;
development of executing agencies. NGOs have improved their subproject appraisal&#13;
methodologies and implementation strategies. FHIS subprojects have had a large impact&#13;
on private contractors, some 900 of whom have worked on FHIS-financed subprojects to&#13;
date. The number of private contractors has increased and several of them, who were&#13;
4 Figures regarding employment creation need to be interpreted with some caution. These data are&#13;
derivative; they are based on calculations using subproject contractor payrolls and average execution&#13;
tinme of projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
individual contractors, have expanded into small firms. Another interesting development&#13;
has been the improvement of the municipalities' capabilities in project preparation. Several&#13;
of them, which were institutionally weak at the start of FHIS, have contracted qualified&#13;
engineers who can put together good-quality project proposals. The poorest&#13;
municipalities have received special assistance from FLUS in project preparation. FLIS is&#13;
also starting to have an impact on line ministries, which recognize FLIS' comparative&#13;
advantage in getting subprojects implemented. They are looking at the FHIS model, and&#13;
considering ways to improve their methods of operation.&#13;
B. Implementation Experience and Issues&#13;
(1) Targeting&#13;
2.16  FHIS resources have been allocated to all 293 municipalities, which is consistent&#13;
with its goal of achieving national recognition for the organization, and developing general&#13;
political support for the economic reform program with which FHIS is associated. Since&#13;
there are poor pockets even in wealthier municipalities, nationwide coverage is justified.&#13;
2.17   Experience in several social funds has shown that, if no targeting mechanism is&#13;
used to allocate investments, a larger proportion of funds will be absorbed by wealthier&#13;
municipalities, which have a greater capacity to prepare subproject proposals because of&#13;
the larger number of private firms, engineers, and NGOs operating in these areas. The&#13;
purpose of FHIS' targeting mechanism has been to ensure that funds would be more fairly&#13;
distributed. To a significant extent, this was attained, although the goals set by FLITS were&#13;
not reached. Table 3 presents a breakdown of FHIS' resource allocations from 1990 until&#13;
January 1, 1995 to municipalities by poverty level and by year, along with a breakdown of&#13;
allocation targets for the period as a whole. FHIS' achievements with respect to targeting&#13;
have improved over time, with allocations to "very poor" municipalities increasing from 8&#13;
percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1994, while allocations to "regular" municipalities shrank&#13;
from 44 percent to 36 percent over the same period. Achievements were still well below&#13;
FHIS' ambitious targets, however: poorer municipalities (i.e., the total of the three&#13;
groups "very poor", "poor", and "deficient", representing 65 percent of the population)&#13;
received 64 percent of total resource commitments, versus a target of 73 percent, while&#13;
wealthier municipalities received 35 percent, versus a target of 25 percent.5&#13;
s Since some of FHIS' funds are specifically earmarked by donors for investment in wealthier&#13;
municipalities, the results in table 3--which are based on the totals of all funds invested by FHIS each&#13;
year--somewhat distort the results of FHIS' targeting mechanisms.&#13;

a Map at end of this report uses different nomenclature and combines "regular" and&#13;
"acceptable".&#13;
bAs of mid-year 1994.&#13;
2.18  FHIS targeting has actually been better than shown by the above numbers, because&#13;
the current poverty mapping does not take into account the wide disparities in poverty&#13;
levels within metropolitan areas. For instance, within Tegucigalpa--a municipality&#13;
categorized as "regular"--an estimated 152,000 people (some 2.8 percent of the national&#13;
population) live in conditions of poverty comparable to the poorest municipalities in the&#13;
country. According to FHIS staff, FHIS investments within the Central District have been&#13;
concentrated in these poorer zones; if investments within Tegucigalpa and other&#13;
metropolitan areas were disaggregated by smaller geographical units--which is planned&#13;
under the proposed project--the coverage index for the "very poor" category would be&#13;
closerto 1.0.&#13;
2.19  Other factors contributing to a weaker than desired record on targeting are: (a)&#13;
poorer municipalities generally have a lower capacity to prepare subprojects; (b) NGO-&#13;
sponsored subprojects tend to be located in "regular" and "acceptable" municipalities,&#13;
where there are better developed informal sectors; (c) promotion has been insufficient in&#13;
poorer municipalities; and (d) subprojects are usually smaller in poorer areas. Also, the&#13;
lack of a unified and reliable data bank regarding social needs (see para. 2.46) reduces the&#13;
ability of FIUS to efficiently target its resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(2) Subproject Portfolio&#13;
Quality, Sustainability, and Implications for FHIS' Institutional Capacity&#13;
2.20  Although FHIS' subproject quality is generally good, there are some problems&#13;
related to implementation and sustainability, which got worse during the rapid expansion&#13;
of subproject approvals in the election year 1993. FHIS has recently made significant&#13;
progress in addressing these "problem" subprojects. Nevertheless, the remaining problems&#13;
point to the need for FHIS to further improve its institutional capacity as it relates to a&#13;
number of critical steps during the subproject cycle. The underlying issues are discussed&#13;
briefly below.&#13;
2.21   Planning. Up until now, FHIS has responded to project requests more or less on a&#13;
first-come, first-served basis, filling up its bi-annual sectoral and municipal allocations on&#13;
an ad hoc basis. Under the proposed project, FHIS would establish a more systematic&#13;
methodology for planning, implementing, and monitoring its work program, based on the&#13;
banks of raw requests and of formulated projects already in the pipeline, and on estimates&#13;
of when projects will enter the different departments. This planning system would enable&#13;
FFHS to determine whether it is meeting its production goals, and to make appropriate&#13;
adjustments regarding staffing and other inputs.&#13;
2.22  Promotion. The first steps to ensuring that there will be sustained interest in the&#13;
implementation, operation, and maintenance of an investment are (a) the verification that&#13;
subprojects are responsive to genuine local demand, i.e., on the part of beneficiaries, and&#13;
(b) the involvement of beneficiaries early on in the identification and design stages of&#13;
subproject development. Therefore, FHIS promotion staff should facilitate the&#13;
identification of priority subprojects with the participation of communities, on the basis of&#13;
a series of selection criteria. FHIS promoters do carry out these activities, which they call&#13;
"direct" promotion; however, about 85 percent of the subprojects implemented since&#13;
FHIS' creation have been identified and formulated on the basis of what FHIS refers to as&#13;
"spontaneous" promotion, which is where FHIS staff are not directly involved in&#13;
overseeing or facilitating subproject development. FHIS has now embarked on a major&#13;
community participation effort (see Annex 4), and, in that context, is addressing both&#13;
staffing and methodological deficiencies in its Promotion Unit to improve its capacity to&#13;
carry out direct promotion and to address community participation issues in the early&#13;
stages of subproject development.&#13;
2.23   Appraisal. In accordance with FHIS' Operational Manuals, the Evaluation Unit&#13;
appraises formulated subprojects on the basis of a number of criteria, including community&#13;
involvement, feasibility, social impact, and sustainability. However, the actual process of&#13;
subproject evaluation could be improved. As is the case in the Promotion Unit, the&#13;
staffing and methodologies of the Evaluation Unit will have to be improved to ensure that&#13;
FHIS has the capacity to evaluate whether subprojects accurately respond to the&#13;
community's demands, and that proposed solutions are appropriate, efficient, and&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.24  Contracting. Despite the ongoing need for direct contracting for subprojects&#13;
costing less than US$35,000 (see para. 4.8), FHIS will have to ensure that this mechanism&#13;
is properly controlled. Direct contracting helps: (a) speed up implementation of the&#13;
project cycle and stimulate a wide distribution of smaller projects; (b) compensate for the&#13;
weak technical capacities of many municipalities to carry out feasibility studies; and (c)&#13;
overcome the small size of the contracting sector as an obstacle to FHIS' program&#13;
development. However, the incentives provided under direct contracting could contribute&#13;
to a reduction of the role beneficiaries are to play in the processes of subproject&#13;
identification and formulation. Thus, although direct contracting should continue to be a&#13;
substantial procurement mechanism, FHIS needs to somewhat reduce its reliance on this&#13;
method of procurement, and to strengthen safeguards against possible misuse.&#13;
2.25   FHIS also needs to ensure that its policies and practices regarding contractor&#13;
guarantees and subproject advance payments provide proper incentives for contractors to&#13;
respect their responsibilities in subproject implementation. During the 1993 run-up to the&#13;
presidential elections, contrary to its own Operational Manuals, FHIS, on occasion,&#13;
relaxed its own requirements for the application of bank guarantees to secure subproject&#13;
progress in favor of the much less reliable promissory note, sometimes without requiring&#13;
any cosigner. FHIS also, sometimes, increased the percentage of total project cost that&#13;
could be paid in the form of a project advance. However, FHIS has recently corrected&#13;
these practices, and started legal action against non-performance.&#13;
2.26   Supervision. The implementation problems mentioned above point most&#13;
significantly to ongoing deficiencies in FH1S' capacity to supervise subproject execution.&#13;
FHIS' original idea regarding supervision was that the subproject sponsor would have the&#13;
direct responsibility for supervising the construction phase, with FIUS inspectors&#13;
supervising these local supervisors on a semi-monthly basis. However, this system has&#13;
proved difficult, since the majority of supervisors simply did not have sufficient technical&#13;
skills to satisfactorily perform this function, and subproject sponsors did not have&#13;
sufficient resources to pay these individuals. Moreover, FHIS' Tegucigalpa-based&#13;
inspectors have been overwhelmed by the numerical and geographical explosion in the&#13;
number of FHIS subprojects financed during 1993, and have been unable to visit some&#13;
subprojects even once a month. In the past, FHIS hired additional inspectors, but that was&#13;
not sufficient. Therefore, FHIS will now consider more innovative solutions than simply&#13;
hiring additional staff for its Tegucigalpa headquarters, such as contracting subproject&#13;
supervision out to regionally-based firms or individuals, to be supervised in turn by FHIS&#13;
inspectors, and increasing the involvement of beneficiaries in supervision activities. FHIS&#13;
will also improve the capacity of the Supervision Department to oversee the increased&#13;
community participation components of subprojects, as well as the basic needs program,&#13;
and include the cost of supervison in the subproject cost.&#13;
2.27   Ex-post Evaluation. Systematic ex-post evaluation of FHIS subprojects is&#13;
important to ascertain whether the program is achieving the objectives for which it was&#13;
designed, whether subproject sponsors are meeting their commitments to maintain and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
operate the subprojects financed by the FHIS, and whether beneficiaries are actually&#13;
making use of FHIS investments. Monitoring and evaluation also facilitate the drawing of&#13;
lessons from the program for the improvement of planning. However, at present, FHIS&#13;
does not have a coherent system of subproject impact evaluation. While some information&#13;
regarding financial and physical aspects of subprojects is gathered in the course of&#13;
supervision, and in the context of periodic external audits, this information is not yet&#13;
sufficient to permit the evaluation of impact, subproject quality, utilization, maintenance,&#13;
and the perceptions and levels of participation of beneficiaries. The proposed project&#13;
would support corrective action in this area (see para. 2.39).&#13;
Other Issues in the Subproject Portfolio&#13;
2.28   Basic Needs Program. This program aims to improve the living conditions of&#13;
vulnerable groups, complement MOE and MOH actions through activities of direct benefit&#13;
to vulnerable populations, and support social assistance subprojects executed by NGOs&#13;
that target vulnerable groups. Priority attention is given to women and children, especially&#13;
female-headed households, and indigenous groups. Although the program has achieved its&#13;
goal of focusing on the county's most marginal groups--indeed, the country's 118 poorest&#13;
municipalities received 100 percent of planned financing--the program lacks some&#13;
definition. As mentioned above, three-fifths of FHIS' investment under this program has&#13;
gone toward the provision of school desks, and much of the rest toward the training of&#13;
midwives. New needs should be identified in close consultation with the social line&#13;
agencies, NGOs, and communities. Also, FHIS' capacity to supervise the program will&#13;
need to be improved. At present, supervision tends to parallel infrastructure subproject&#13;
supervision, which focuses on the quantifiable, physical dimension of subprojects rather&#13;
than their social dimension (e.g. community participation). FHIS is also weak in&#13;
monitoring these subprojects' success in achieving their objectives. The basic needs&#13;
program would be supported under the proposed project through a technical assistance&#13;
component (see para. 3.6 and Annex 9).&#13;
2.29   Water and Sanitation. As mentioned in para. 1.7 above, the provision of water&#13;
and basic sanitation in Honduras is highly inefficient, and biased in favor of urban areas.&#13;
Although FHIS has the potential to make a significant impact in these sectors, to date, the&#13;
water supply and sanitation component of FHIS' portfolio has been somewhat weak. Of&#13;
5,793 subprojects approved as of January 1995, only 8 percent were in the water supply&#13;
and sanitation sector--including 3. 1 percent in construction of latrines. Smaller-scale&#13;
water projects, particularly in rural areas, have been especially under-represented.&#13;
Sustainability of water and sanitation subprojects has also been identified as an area&#13;
needing improvement. These subsections would be supported under the proposed project&#13;
through a technical assistance component (see para. 3.6 and Annex 8).&#13;
2.30   Environment. FHIS' activities with respect to the environment fall into two&#13;
areas:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(a)    For all subprojects, FHIS carries out environmental impact assessments.&#13;
Its Operational Manuals stipulate that subprojects not adversely affect the&#13;
environment and indigenous cultures. FHIS evaluators use a checklist of&#13;
questions to undertake a short environmental impact assessment for each&#13;
subproject. The main factors analyzed are the potentially negative effects&#13;
that may result from: (i) location of infrastructure; (ii) generation of&#13;
sediments; and (iii) alteration of waterways. With the help of technical&#13;
assistance under the Environmental Development Project, FHIS is&#13;
improving its environmental evaluation criteria (see Annex 5).&#13;
(b)    FHIS also finances subprojects in environmental infrastructure and&#13;
prolectiont. To date, FHIS has financed relatively few subprojects in this&#13;
area; such subprojects have accounted for only 0.5 percent of all&#13;
investments (in forestation/reforestation, erosion protection, and&#13;
irrigation). However, subject to the outcome of the technical assistance&#13;
provided under the Environmental Development Project, FHIS intends to&#13;
expand its activities in this sector, and has already established an&#13;
Environmental Advisory unit to oversee its activities in the sector.&#13;
(3) Management Information System&#13;
2.31   FHIS has developed a substantial microcomputer-based management information&#13;
system (MIS), which has facilitated subproject administration and monitoring by enabling&#13;
the staff to rapidly access data on the current status of any subproject, especially in&#13;
discussions with sponsors. The MIS has also helped to improve subproject supervision&#13;
and financial analysis, especially in the areas of cash flows and monitoring of&#13;
administrative costs. However, FHIS has been slow to implement improvements in the&#13;
system, necessary to provide integration between financial and operational modules. The&#13;
proposed project would address this (see para. 2.38.e).&#13;
(4) Collaboration with Line Ministries and Other Government Institutions&#13;
2.32   Since its inception, FIHS has actively promoted and achieved good working&#13;
relations with line ministries and other government agencies, which has contributed to&#13;
improved quality and sustainability in FHIS-financed subprojects. Specifically, FHIS has&#13;
signed letters of understanding and inter-institutional agreements with different entities.&#13;
The general objective of the agreements has been to guarantee the participation of sectoral&#13;
institutions in the development of concrete subproject activities and provide subproject&#13;
supervision and continuity. However, there is a need for stronger collaboration at the&#13;
identification and completion stages, to ensure that only priority subprojects get carried&#13;
out and that maintenance is provided for. This is even more important in view of the&#13;
current decentralization effort, with more of the Government's responsibilities expected to&#13;
be passed on to the municipalities. As part of the preparation and implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
proposed project, considerable corrective action has been and will be taken (see para.&#13;
2.44).&#13;
(5) Resource Mobilization and Needs&#13;
2.33   Since 1990, FHIS has mobilized financing in the amount of about US$121 million,&#13;
of which US$99 million, or 82 percent, has come from the international community.&#13;
Table 4 provides a breakdown of amounts and sources of financing. Total uncommitted&#13;
funds available from all donors as of January 1, 1995 were nil, but a loan from OPEC in&#13;
the amount of US$5 million has since become available.&#13;

Note: This amount does not include the contribution which FlS has received from subproject&#13;
beneficiaries in the fonn of money, materials, land, labor, etc.&#13;
Source: FlI-S, January 1995.&#13;
2.34   Total disbursements of FHIS since its creation until January 1, 1995 have been&#13;
US$111.6 million. The first and only IDB loan in the amount of US$31.5 million is fully&#13;
committed, and 95 percent disbursed. With regard to the IDA Credits, SIF I was closed&#13;
on March 31, 1994, three months beyond the original schedule; the last disbursement was&#13;
made on July 29, 1994. Under SIF II, US$9.0 million had been disbursed by May 4, 1995,&#13;
and credit closing is expected by June 30, 1995, six months beyond the original target.&#13;
Disbursements in 1994 were slower than expected, because commitments during that&#13;
period were reduced. This was due primarily to uncertainties surrounding the&#13;
administrative transition of FHIS, although these problems were exacerbated by Hurricane&#13;
Gert, which hit Honduras in September 1993, and by the severe shortages of cement and&#13;
electricity that developed in the last months of 1993. However, FHIS has used this slow&#13;
down to correct some of the problems created in the election year, and to demonstrate its&#13;
renewed ability to channel considerable amounts of resources into a solid subproject&#13;
portfolio. As of April 28, 1995, FHIS had developed an active pipeline of 1,483&#13;
infrastructure projects and 279 basic needs projects, amounting to the equivalent of&#13;
US$42.0 million and US$3.8 million, respectively (See Annex 6). In light of FHIS'&#13;
proven implementation capacity, Honduras' continuing investment needs in the social&#13;
sectors, and the Government's firm commitment to continue to provide adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
counterpart funds, it is expected that FHIS could easily channel resources of US$100&#13;
million over the course of the next four years.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from Past Operations&#13;
2.35  There has been considerable experience with social investment funds in other&#13;
countries and under the first two IDA Credits for FHIS. The lessons of this experience&#13;
have been discussed in numerous World Bank and FHIS reviews and reports (see Annex&#13;
19). The principal lessons, and how they are incorporated in the proposed project, are&#13;
described in this section.&#13;
2.36 Limited Roles and Objectives. Limiting social investment funds' roles to the&#13;
tasks of contracting for the construction of social and economic infrastructure, related&#13;
goods and services, and a limited range of social services has promoted professionalism&#13;
and efficiency in the use of funds and prevented duplication of functions with the sector&#13;
ministries. The proposed project will continue to limit the use of funds to specific social&#13;
subsectors for well-defined subprojects. Although environmental subprojects may be&#13;
added, this would only be supported after the successful implementation of pilot&#13;
subprojects under the Environmental Development Project (see para. 3.4).&#13;
2.37  Government Commitment. An important aspect of FHIS' success in achieving&#13;
its objectives was that it became an integral part of the Government's high priority&#13;
economic and social policy; i.e., a program to cushion the social costs of the economic&#13;
adjustment program. This policy framework provided FHIS with sustained, high level&#13;
political support and the budgetary resources to start the program even before external&#13;
financing could be mobilized. This, in turn, attracted donors from the international&#13;
community. The new administration, which took office in early-1994, continues to view&#13;
FlUS' work as a priority. Under the proposed project, the President of the Republic&#13;
would continue to serve as the Chairman of the Board, and the Government has&#13;
committed to the continued provision of adequate counterpart funding.&#13;
2.38  Operational Efficiency. Under SIF I and II, Fl-HS succeeded in processing and&#13;
approving subprojects--and disbursing funds--relatively rapidly, while sustaining&#13;
subproject quality reasonably well; furthennore, FHIS was able to keep administration&#13;
costs within acceptable levels. The factors that seem to be most important in ensuring&#13;
operational efficiency in social investment funds, and a description of the measures FIUS&#13;
would take under the proposed project to maintain and improve its capacity in this area,&#13;
are described below:&#13;
(a)   A high degree of autonomy. Freedom from normal government&#13;
budgeting, procurement, and disbursement restrictions enables social&#13;
investment funds to award contracts to private contractors simply and&#13;
quickly, and makes the SIF's financial resources independent from the&#13;
Government's annual budget cycle and cash management procedures,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
which means that contractors can be paid in a timely manner. Under the&#13;
proposed project, FHIS would continue to enjoy freedom from these&#13;
restrictions.&#13;
(b)    Professionally competent, hard working, and well-motivated staff,&#13;
particularly at senior levels. High quality management teams enable SIFs&#13;
to be managed like private enterprises. In FHIS, efficient management is&#13;
reflected in clearly defined products, large-scale production, quality&#13;
control, accountability, the capacity to attract and retain quality staff, and&#13;
an implementation strategy based on decentralization and privatization.&#13;
The most critical factors in ensuring the quality of the staff have been good&#13;
salaries, lack of tenure, carefully detailed operating procedures, and an&#13;
executive director giving priority to technical competence and efficiency.&#13;
FHIS would implement further improvements under the proposed project,&#13;
which includes provisions for management training courses, and reforms in&#13;
the system for recruiting and remunerating staff on the basis of technical&#13;
competence, including the establishment of a personnel evaluation system.&#13;
(c)    A sound organizational structure. FHIS has recently simplified its&#13;
organizational structure, and made it better suited to new strategic&#13;
emphases, such as community participation and attention to the&#13;
environment. This includes the establishment of the position of Deputy&#13;
Executive Director, thus relieving the Executive Director of some of his&#13;
day-to-day activities. Further changes could result from technical&#13;
assistance to be provided under the proposed project, and from a proposed&#13;
study of the future role of FHIS and its relationship with the line ministries,&#13;
to be funded under the proposed Public Sector Modernization Project.&#13;
(d)    Efficient subproject processing mechanisms, including (a) the use of a&#13;
standardized menu of subprojects, which contributes to efficient subproject&#13;
implementation by: (i) limiting the range of specialists to be recruited by&#13;
FHIS, (ii) providing standard parameters and specifications used by&#13;
sponsors in subproject preparation, and (iii) facilitating appraisal and&#13;
supervision of subprojects by FHIS staff; (b) comprehensive operational&#13;
manuals with clear eligibility, appraisal, procurement, implementation, and&#13;
supervision criteria; and (c) close supervision of subprojects during&#13;
implementation to ensure quality control. To improve the efficiency of&#13;
subproject processing, as well as to enhance the quality of subprojects,&#13;
FHIS has already begun to address a number of methodological and&#13;
staffing weaknesses in the units responsible for project promotion,&#13;
appraisal, and supervision. The project would also provide technical&#13;
assistance to improve management of the project cycle, and to further&#13;
improve and simplify operational manuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
(e)    A well-designed management information system to facilitate&#13;
automated subproject processing, and to enable line managers to obtain&#13;
quick access to information necessary for decision-making. The project&#13;
would provide technical assistance and equipment to help FHIS establish a&#13;
better integrated MIS.&#13;
2.39   Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms provide&#13;
feedback on operational processes as well as on subproject quality and impact, and can&#13;
thereby enable SIFs to make institutional and methodological improvements during the&#13;
course of program implementation. Under the proposed project, FHIS would receive&#13;
technical assistance (para. 3.6) to improve its capacity to monitor program performance&#13;
and to evaluate its subproject portfolio through: (a) adjustments in the methodologies&#13;
used for ex-ante evaluation, in order to improve the basis upon which FHIS selects its&#13;
subprojects for financing, and to better enable FHIS to conduct ex-post evaluation of&#13;
subprojects; (b) elaboration of the indicators FHIS uses to provide information on&#13;
targeting, operational efficiency, and subproject quality and impact; (c) compilation of&#13;
semi-annual progress reports based on the monitoring indicators; and (d) carrying out of&#13;
periodic in-depth evaluations of the impact of the FHIS program.&#13;
2.40   Transparency/Accountability. The insistence of external donors on the need for&#13;
full transparency has contributed to generally proper use of funds, as well as reduced the&#13;
temptation of political interference in FHIS operations. Transparency of operations has&#13;
been an essential element in attracting external resources and projecting a good public&#13;
image in Honduras. Under the proposed project, FHIS would continue its system of&#13;
quarterly and annual audits, as well as strengthen its internal auditing and control systems.&#13;
2.41   Targeting. Targeting mechanisms in social investment funds are important to&#13;
improve equitable distribution of resources, as well as to increase transparency in the&#13;
allocation of resources. In general, FHIS has targeted its subprojects well. Furthermore,&#13;
since the number of proposals has grown to exceed budgets for each municipality, and&#13;
FlI-S plans to put greater emphasis on community participation in the formulation of&#13;
projects, it is likely that targeting will improve in the future. Nonetheless, with the help of&#13;
technical assistance, a number of measures have been, or would be, taken under the&#13;
proposed project to improve FHIS' targeting. These include the following:&#13;
(a)    The process by which budget allocations are derived from the population&#13;
data and the poverty index has been reviewed and improved. This includes&#13;
the adjustment of formulas to take into account illiteracy and differing local&#13;
costs of factors of production (i.e., labor, materials, equipment).&#13;
(b)   The indicators used to calculate the municipal poverty index would be&#13;
updated and improved. This would include the incorporation of new&#13;
information regarding existing social infrastructure in each municipality and&#13;
likely beneficiaries of such infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
(c)   Larger municipalities would be broken down into smaller "zones," which&#13;
can be categorized and targeted appropriately.&#13;
2.42 Emphasis on sustainability. In Poverty Alleviation and Social Investment&#13;
Funds: The Latin American Experience,6 the authors point out that subproject&#13;
sustainability continues to pose problems for many social investment funds. As mentioned&#13;
in para. 2.20 above, FHIS is no exception. Although FHIS' involvement in subproject&#13;
processing technically ends with the completion of construction and the legal closing of a&#13;
subproject account, there are a number of areas in which FHIS has a strong influence on&#13;
the prospects for the sustained operation and maintenance of its subprojects. Indeed,&#13;
FIlS has attempted to structure its subprojects to ensure the sustainability of investments&#13;
and benefits. Elements of this emphasis on sustainability include: supporting subprojects&#13;
with low recurrent costs; in cases of construction, requirements that line ministries create&#13;
and budget necessary staff positions; provisions to ensure adequate cost recovery and&#13;
maintenance of social infrastructure (including organization and training at the community&#13;
level'); selection of basic needs subprojects sponsored by NGOs with proven track&#13;
records; and expansion of already successful projects, with significant cost sharing&#13;
requirements from sponsors, and in consultation with line ministries and municipalities.&#13;
2.43   Under the proposed project, FHIS would make additional efforts to improve the&#13;
prospects for subproject sustainability. Probably the most important effort FHIS intends&#13;
to make is to ensure that beneficiaries are involved in subproject development at an early&#13;
stage. However, this increased emphasis on community participation should not end once&#13;
the project is formulated but, rather, needs to be instilled in FIUS' operations at every&#13;
stage along the subproject cycle, including through the construction and operation phases.&#13;
To this end, FH-S has established a Community Participation advisory unit. FHIS also&#13;
intends to increase its emphasis on components that are complementary to its&#13;
infrastructure and social services subprojects, such as community training, and the&#13;
development of user boards and committees. To assist this effort, KfW has provided a&#13;
grant in the amount of DM650,000 to fund a Sustainability Pilot Project, to be carried out&#13;
by a local NGO. Its results should be available in early-1996. FHIS would arrange a&#13;
workshop with the participation of IDA, IDB and KfW following the completion of the&#13;
various pilot projects to discuss all ongoing efforts to promote community participation,&#13;
and to agree upon follow-up action. Under the proposed project, technical assistance&#13;
would be provided for studying cost-sharing and other financial arrangements to improve&#13;
the prospects for subproject maintenance and sustainability. Finally, increased monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of post-implementation quality, sustainability, and impact may also provide&#13;
valuable inputs regarding other ways FHIS can improve prospects for subproject&#13;
sustainability.&#13;

2.44 Collaboration with Social Ministries and Municipalities. Coordination with&#13;
social sector ministries has been essential for the effective delivery of priority social&#13;
services to beneficiaries, and will be facilitated through the institutional strengthening of&#13;
MOE and MOH pursued under the Nutrition and Health, Basic Education, and Public&#13;
Sector Modernization Projects. Such coordination, as well as coordination with the&#13;
Honduran Association of Municipalities (AMHON), will grow increasingly important as&#13;
FHIS enters the next, longer-term phase (see Annex 7). Under the proposed project,&#13;
FLITS' good record in collaboration with these agencies would be maintained and improved&#13;
through: (a) inclusion of the Ministers of Education and of Health on FHIS' Board of&#13;
Directors; (b) renewed letters of understanding / inter-institutional agreements with&#13;
relevant entities; (c) cooperation with line ministries and agencies in the establishment of&#13;
broad targets for priority spending within each of the social subsectors (education, health,&#13;
water and sanitation, etc.); and (d) involvement of the line agencies in the annual&#13;
discussions between the Government, FHIS, and the donors on FHIS' work program,&#13;
budget, and recurrent costs (see para. 5.3). New agreements between FL-US and MOE&#13;
and MOH. as well as a model agreement between FHIS and the municipalities. including&#13;
assurances regarding operations and maintenance, were discussed and agreed during&#13;
negotiations, and their incorporation in the Subsidiary Agreement would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the credit (see paras. 4.6 and 7.2(a)).8&#13;
2.45   One aspect of the coordination with social sector agencies would be the&#13;
establishment of broad targets for priority spending within each of the social subsectors&#13;
(education, health, water and sanitation, etc.). These broad targets would not be intended&#13;
to diminish the capacity of FHIS to respond to local demand for priority subprojects.&#13;
However, in light of the increasingly important role FHIS has come to play in the national&#13;
poverty alleviation strategy, and in light of social spending limits established in the context&#13;
of the macroeconomic reform program, these targets will enable the line ministries and&#13;
FHIS to set parameters--based on national priorities--within which local demand can more&#13;
rationally be addressed.&#13;
2.46   As a necessary step to set these parameters, however, Honduras would have to&#13;
develop a unified and reliable data bank regarding national social needs. At present, bits&#13;
and pieces of information regarding population and social infrastructure can be found in&#13;
various institutions and agencies in Honduras. Yet, in order for the Government to&#13;
establish national priorities, and for FHIS to effectively and efficiently target its&#13;
investments (see also para. 2.41), these data would have to be collated and analyzed&#13;
systematically. This will be supported under the proposed project through a technical&#13;
assistance component (see para. 3.7 and Annex 11).&#13;
8 Collaboration with the municipalities would also be helped by the proposed technical assistance for&#13;
decentralization and municipal development, financed by RUTA Social and coordinated by&#13;
SECPLAN, FHIS, and the Presidential Comrnksion for Modernization of the State, as well as by the&#13;
local capacity building technical assistance component included in the project (see para. 3.6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
3.1    The proposed project would continue to assist the Government in strengthening its&#13;
poverty alleviation efforts and in maintaining social cohesion, while the Government&#13;
attempts to regain fiscal balance and the line ministries strengthen their institutional&#13;
capacities. It would also support the Government's decentralization strategy, development&#13;
of the local contracting industry, the sustainability of subprojects, and the targeting of&#13;
scarce resources to the poorer areas. To achieve this, it would focus on meeting priority&#13;
social and economic infrastructure and basic needs, decided in close consultation with&#13;
relevant government departments, municipalities, NGOs, and communities, within the&#13;
parameters of municipal allocations decided on the basis of a poverty targeting formula.&#13;
3.2    The project would support FHIS' investment program for a four-year period, as&#13;
well as efforts to establish a better social data base and to assist municipalities on&#13;
environmental matters. It would provide for (a) a range of small-scale, social and&#13;
economic infrastructure subprojects; (b) a priority basic needs program; (c) a&#13;
comprehensive program of technical assistance to help FHIS overcome some institutional&#13;
weaknesses; (d) the establishment of a social data mapping system and strengthening of&#13;
the design and implementation of the national household survey as the major tools to&#13;
target the poor and to monitor progress of social development programs; and (e) subject&#13;
to trials carried out by FHIS under the Environmental Development Project, a small&#13;
program of technical assistance to municipalities in assessing environmental issues and in&#13;
preparing programs for corrective action.&#13;
B. Project Components&#13;
3.3    The project would have the following investment, technical assistance, and project&#13;
management components:&#13;
3.4   Infrastructure Subprojects (US$95 million or 84 percent of total project costs).&#13;
Subprojects sponsored by municipalities, community organizations, and NGOs, dealing&#13;
with (i) rehabilitation, maintenance, and expansion of preprimary, primary, and junior&#13;
secondary schools, health centers and posts, and small water and sewerage facilities, as&#13;
well as maintenance of rural roads; (ii) construction and repair of drainage and irrigation&#13;
canals and ditches, public markets and other public facilities, and construction of bridges,&#13;
gutters, and sidewalks; (iii) rehabilitation of archeological and historical sites aimed at&#13;
preserving cultural heritage, as well as programs focused on ethnic minorities; and (iv)&#13;
subject to the outcome of the pilot subprojects carried out under the Environmental&#13;
Development Project in 20 municipalities over the next year, small-scale environmental&#13;
investments, such as urban and community parks, solid and liquid waste management,&#13;
protection of water sources, soil protection and erosion control, biodiversity, and energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
generation and conservation. These subprojects would be executed by private&#13;
contractors, NGOs, municipalities, and public sector agencies. A more detailed&#13;
description of the water supply, sanitation, and environmental projects is given in Annex 8.&#13;
3.5    Basic Needs Programs (US$5 million or 4 percent of total project costs).&#13;
Programs dealing with nutrition, training of midwives and other health workers, childcare&#13;
and early development programs, care for the elderly and disabled, teaching materials, and&#13;
community development for ethnic minorities.9 They would be executed by NGOs and&#13;
private and public sector agencies, and require significant promotional efforts from FHIS.&#13;
The programs would address priority social needs, identified and designed in consultation&#13;
with MOE and MOH. A more detailed description of this program is given in Annex 9.&#13;
3.6   Institutional Strengthening of FHIS (US$0.8 million or 1 percent of total project&#13;
costs). This component would include: (i) 16 months of technical assistance to help&#13;
strengthen FHIS' policies and practices for management of subproject cycle / production&#13;
line (planning, identifying, appraising, contracting, supervising, and evaluating&#13;
Subprojects); this would include, inter alia, analysis and recommendations on&#13;
organizational structure, manuals, staffing, and training requirements; (ii) training&#13;
programs for FHIS' management and staff, (iii) four months of technical assistance to help&#13;
improve FHIS' systems for recruitment, training, evaluation, and remuneration of&#13;
personnel; (iv) six months of technical assistance to help improve the MIS system; (v) two&#13;
months of technical assistance to help strengthen FHIST' basic needs program; (vi) two&#13;
months of technical assistance to help promote community participation in all stages of the&#13;
subproject cycle; (vii) a promotional training program to make US Peace Corps volunteers&#13;
and their Honduran counterparts aware of how to access FHIS funding for priority&#13;
community development subprojects; (viii) six months of technical assistance to improve&#13;
FHIS' accounting and internal auditing practices; (ix) six months of technical assistance&#13;
for analysis of financing mechanisms for maintenance of subprojects; (x) 12 months of&#13;
technical assistance to help improve FHIS' water supply and sanitation policies and&#13;
practices; and (xi) workshops and materials organized by the Program of Support to the&#13;
Informal Sector (PASI) to assist its micro-enterprise program in general and female&#13;
entrepreneurs in particular.&#13;
3.7   Social Data Collection and Analysis (US$0.1 million or 0.1 percent of total project&#13;
costs). Because Honduras has no single information tool with which to assess overall&#13;
deficiencies in coverage of the social sector needs, this component would assist with&#13;
creating a social data mapping system and improving the household survey sample,&#13;
questionnaire, and execution. With input from the line ministries, coordinated through the&#13;
State Secretariat of Planning (SECPLAN), the mapping system would allow FHIS and the&#13;
responsible line ministries to better assess priority needs in given communities, and to&#13;
evaluate progress over time. In addition, to obtain more useful data on poverty and social&#13;
indicators, there is a need to update and improve the household survey sample, redesign&#13;
the questionnaire, and improve field work practices. A modest program of technical&#13;
9School and health center furniture, which previously were part of the Basic Needs prograin, would be&#13;
moved to the Infrastructure subprojects category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
assistance, managed through SECPLAN, in consultation with FHIS, would be provided&#13;
under the project. A more detailed description is given in Annex 11.&#13;
3.8   Environmental Assistance to Municipalities (US$0.9 million or I percent of total&#13;
project costs). Subject to the outcome of the technical assistance to municipal&#13;
environmental management in 20 municipalities under the Environmental Development&#13;
Project, the proposed project would include a modest environmental awareness and&#13;
training program for municipalities not covered under the earlier assistance. This&#13;
component should help the municipalities to improve management of their natural&#13;
resources and to address their environmental problems, as well as to increase public&#13;
participation in the solution of the environmental problems of the communities. It would&#13;
be managed by SEDA, in close cooperation with FHIS. A more detailed description is&#13;
given in Annex 12.&#13;
3.9   Project Management (US$10.8 million or 10 percent of total project costs).&#13;
Project administration during the four-year implementation period is expected to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$9.5 million. Other subcomponents would be the procurement of some&#13;
vehicles and equipment, and the services of the external auditor. A more detailed&#13;
description is given in Annex 13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
4. PROJECT COST, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITS&#13;
A. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
4.1   Project Cost. The total project cost, including taxes and duties, is estimated at&#13;
about US$1 12.6 million equivalent, of which an estimated US$22.9 million would be in&#13;
foreign exchange (20 percent of project cost); taxes and duties amount to about US$4.4&#13;
million. The table below summarizes the estimated cost by component. Investments&#13;
amount to 88 percent of total costs, technical assistance to 2 percent, and management to&#13;
10 percent. Project costs were estimated at February 1995 price levels. Since the project&#13;
is essentially a financial intermediary type operation, and physical targets are not the main&#13;
objectives of the proposed project, no contingencies have been provided for the&#13;
subprojects. Any increase in the average subproject cost would be reflected in a reduced&#13;
number of subprojects executed. Since most technical assistance would be provided in the&#13;
first project year, no price contingencies have been provided for this category either.&#13;
However, for project administration, vehicles and equipment, and the external auditor,&#13;
price contingencies were calculated at 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.4 percent for 1997, and 2.5&#13;
percent annually thereafter, according to the Bank Group's estimated Index of Unit Value&#13;
of Manufactured Exports, October 1994. These rates have been applied to local and&#13;
foreign costs, since Honduras has adopted a floating exchange rate system which results in&#13;
periodic market adjustments, that tend to compensate for the difference between&#13;
international inflation on a US dollar base and local inflation rates. No costs for&#13;
environmental subprojects have been included, since these will depend on the results of the&#13;
pilot subprojects funded under the Environmental Development Project, which are&#13;
expected in about one year (para. 4.14). However, subject to the outcome of these pilot&#13;
projects, environmental subprojects would be eligible for funding under the credit. In that&#13;
case, the allocation to other sectors would be reduced. Also, except for a modest amount&#13;
of technical assistance to PASI, no costs have been included for FHIS' special operations,&#13;
such as the micro credit schemes under PASI and PROCATMER; these two operations&#13;
have sufficient funding for credit at present.&#13;

a Includes taxes and duties estimated at about US$4.4 million.&#13;
4.2     The total cost projections of the FHIS subprojects reflect both the demand in the&#13;
various social subsectors, described in paras. 1.5 - 1.7, and the country's limited budget&#13;
prospects. Estimated construction costs for classrooms and health centers are based on&#13;
unit prices per square meter, provided by FHIS and derived from current contracts and&#13;
unit costs for similar standards of construction. Estimated school and health center&#13;
rehabilitation and repair costs are based on unit prices, provided by FHIS and derived&#13;
from current contracts. Estimated construction costs for water supply, sanitation, and&#13;
other facilities, as well as the estimated average basic needs subproject size, too, were&#13;
provided by FHIS, and derived from current contracts. There is also a provision for&#13;
supervision at 3-6 percent and, for preinvestment studies at up to 7.25 percent of total&#13;
subproject cost, depending upon the type of subproject. Estimates for technical assistance&#13;
are based on current rates for local and foreign experts, and estimates for operating costs,&#13;
too, are based on current costs of FHIS. Annex 13 provides detailed cost tables.&#13;
4.3    Incremental Recurrent Costs. As detailed in Annexes I and 13, over the period&#13;
1995-99, there is a need for the construction/reconstruction of about 2,900 classrooms,&#13;
the rehabilitation/repair of about I11,800 classrooms, the rehabilitation/repair of about&#13;
2,600 school bathrooms, and the rehabilitation/repair of about 6,300 school latrines, as&#13;
well as some minor work on health centers. If fully addressed by FHIS, this would mean&#13;
incremental recurrent expenditures for operation and maintenance of about US$0.6 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
in the second project year, US$1.6 million in the third year, US$2.4 million in the fourth&#13;
year, and US$3.0 million thereafter. However, FHIS' contracting capacity is limited, and&#13;
the incremental recurrent expenditures can be expected to be much less. Furthermore,&#13;
additional teachers for new classrooms would require about US$0.6 million in the second&#13;
year, US$1.8 million in the third year, US$3.2 million in the fourth year, and US$4.5&#13;
million thereafter. Based on the 1994 MOE budget of about US$141 million and projected&#13;
budget increments of 4 percent per year during the project period, and even assuming that&#13;
all incremental costs would have to be borne by MOE, the impact of these costs on the&#13;
MOE budget would be 0.2 percent in 1996, 0.8 percent in 1997, 1.7 percent in 1998, 2.4&#13;
percent in 1999, and 2.7 percent in 2000, thus remaining manageable.&#13;
4.4   MOE and MOH are responsible for operation and maintenance costs in their&#13;
respective sectors. However, in the context of the Government's decentralization drive,&#13;
the Government has decided that the municipalities should start to bear at least part of&#13;
these costs. Consequently, the model agreements to be signed between FHIS and the&#13;
municipalities (see para. 2.44) provide for the municipalities to pay 60 percent and the&#13;
beneficiaries 40 percent of the maintenance cost of completed education and health&#13;
subprojects. To help specify the operational arrangements among the various actors, the&#13;
project will provide technical assistance, and a proposal on the improved funding of&#13;
maintenance costs will be submitted to IDA by the Government no later than March 31.&#13;
1996 (para. 7.1 (a)). Teacher salaries are the responsibility of MOE, and this would be&#13;
reflected in the new agreement between FHIS and MOE (see para. 2.44). The cost of&#13;
operation and maintenance of water and sanitation subprojects would be borne by the&#13;
beneficiaries, which reconfirms the importance of establishing a water user board already&#13;
at the time of project identification. The early establishment of "ownership" is of critical&#13;
importance in ensuring beneficiary contributions.&#13;
4.5   Project Financing. The proposed project would be financed by IDA, IDB, the&#13;
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW, various other donors, and&#13;
the Government of Honduras. In addition, subproject beneficiaries would contribute in&#13;
the form of cash, labor, materials, or land. The proposed IDA credit of US$30.0 million&#13;
equivalent (SDR 19.1 million) would finance 27 percent of total project costs, net of taxes&#13;
and duties; it would finance 30 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 26 percent&#13;
of local expenditures. The IDB loan of US$40.0 million, on soft terms, and grant of&#13;
US$619,900 would finance 36 percent of total project costs, net of taxes and duties. The&#13;
KfW soft loan of about US$ 10.0 million equivalent (DM 15.0 million) would finance 9&#13;
percent of total project costs, net of taxes and duties. The amount of local cost financing&#13;
by IDA is in line with other social projects elsewhere in Latin America. The IDA credit&#13;
would be made to the Repulblic of Hotnduiras, which would make the funds available to&#13;
FHIS and SEDA for the execution of the project. The Government of Honduras would&#13;
finance US$11.2 million equivalent, or 10 percent of total project costs, including taxes&#13;
and duties estimated at US$440,000 equivalent. The proposed financing plan is&#13;
summarized in the table below, and expanded in Annex 14.&#13;

4.6    During negotiations. agreement was reached that the Govemment would provide&#13;
annual budget allocations for the project. as well as ensure the funding of the recurrent&#13;
costs of completed FHIS investments, and that these allocations would be reviewed with&#13;
the Bank. IDB. and KfW during annual project implementation reviews (paras.5.3 and 7.1&#13;
(b)). During negotiations, the Government also provided assurances that financing of&#13;
US$40.0 million would be available from IDB. DM 15.0 million from KfW.and US$15.6&#13;
million from other donors, and that the respective funding agreements would be signed b&#13;
March 31. 1996:, if not. alternative financing would have been arranged (para. 7. l(c)). As&#13;
a condition of effectiveness, a FHIS Agreement for making the IDA funds available to&#13;
FHIS. as well as describing the new arrangements between FHIS and MOE and MOH.&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. would have been entered into by the Government and FHIS (para.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
4.7    A Country Procurement Assessment Report for Honduras was issued in&#13;
September 1990. Honduran procurement legislation and procedures are generally&#13;
satisfactory, except where participation of foreign contractors and consultants are&#13;
concerned, due to the preference provisions for local contractors and consultants.&#13;
However, at its establishment, FHIS was exempt from the Government's standard,&#13;
complex procurement procedures. FHIS' special procurement procedures have proved&#13;
successful in expediting project implementation and in ensuring competitive prices, and&#13;
would thus continue to be applied under the proposed project. Procurement of civil&#13;
works and goods would be done following the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995 (Procurement Guidelines). The hiring of&#13;
consultants would be done following the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank of August 1981 (Consultant Guidelines). For&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB), FIlS would use the standard bidding documents&#13;
(SBDs) issued by IDA, with such modifications as agreed to by IDA to be necessary for&#13;
the purpose of the project. For purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, a margin of&#13;
preference for local manufacturers may be applied, in accordance with IDA guidelines.&#13;
For national competitive bidding (NCB), SBDs, satisfactory to IDA, would be used. Table&#13;

4.8   Civil Works. Because of the small size of the civil works in dispersed locations&#13;
(see para. 2.24) to be funded under the Credit, there will be no ICB for the civil works&#13;
costing approximately US$24.2 million equivalent. NCB would be used for contracts&#13;
between US$50,000 and US$500,000 equivalent. To the extent possible, similar types of&#13;
works in the subprojects would be combined in bid packages of at least US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, to minimize administrative costs and take advantage of contractor&#13;
specialization. Works estimated to cost between US$35,000 and US$50,000 equivalent,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$6.7 million equivalent, would be procured under lump&#13;
sum fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from a least three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. To encourage&#13;
competition and increase interest by contractors whenever feasible, contracts for repairs&#13;
and rehabilitation would be grouped into contract packages expected to cost no less than&#13;
US$35,000 equivalent. Procurement of contracts of works and goods, or a combination&#13;
thereof, in small subprojects with a cost less than US$35,000 equivalent, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$13.3 million equivalent, would be done through direct&#13;
contracting of local contractors where competitive proposals cannot be obtained. In&#13;
these cases, to ensure fair pricing, FHIS has a well-tried system of regional, standard unit&#13;
prices, which are being updated periodically, to be used as the basis for negotiations with&#13;
the contractors. During negotiations. FHIS provided assurances that it would continue to&#13;
periodically review its standard regionalized unit prices of civil works and goods. and&#13;
change prices promptly. in a form and substance satisfactory to IDA. if so recommended&#13;
by such a review (para. 7. 1 (d)). In addition, FHIS agreed to gradually reduce the share of&#13;
direct contracting from the historical average of 75 percent of the amount of contracted&#13;
subprojects to no more than 40 percent in 1998. Monitoring procedures would ensure&#13;
that: (i) contracts are not divided into smaller packages for the purpose of awarding&#13;
smaller contracts under direct contracting; and (ii) there is no unjustified concentration of&#13;
contracts awarded to the same individuals or contractors.&#13;
4.9   Goods. Procurement of vehicles, equipment, furniture and other goods would be&#13;
done through procurement procedures satisfactory to IDA. Vehicles and equipment,&#13;
estimated to cost US$ 1.1 million equivalent, would be procured through ICB for bid&#13;
packages of US$150,000 equivalent or more, through limited international bidding (LIB)&#13;
for bid packages of US$50,000 to US$150,000 equivalent, in an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed US$0.2 million equivalent and through international shopping for bid packages of&#13;
US$25,000 to US$50,000 equivalent, in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$0.1&#13;
million equivalent. Contracts for equipment, valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent,&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of a comparison of price quotations solicited from at least&#13;
three suppliers, in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$0.1 million equivalent. School&#13;
and health center furniture and other goods, estimated to cost US$2.8 million equivalent,&#13;
would be procured through NCB for contracts between US$25,000 and US$150,000&#13;
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.4 million, and through national shopping&#13;
(based on quotations from at least three eligible suppliers) for contracts of less than&#13;
US$25,000 equivalent (up to an aggregate amount of US$0.9 million equivalent). In&#13;
cases where it would not be possible to obtain competitive proposals for furniture,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$8,000 equivalent, and up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$0.5 million equivalent, may be awarded through direct contracting.&#13;
4.10 Technical Assistance. Individual consultants and consulting firms that would carry&#13;
out technical assistance, amounting to about US$0.4 million, would be hired following the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines. During appraisal, the time tables for technical assistance under the&#13;
proposed project were reviewed, and found satisfactory. The appointment of consultants&#13;
would be done using standard contract documents for larger contracts, and standard&#13;
documents, to be agreed with IDA, for smaller assignments.&#13;
4.11   Prior Review. Prior review by IDA would include: (a) procurement arrangements&#13;
in accordance with Appendix 1, paragraph I of the IDA Guidelines; (b) all procurement by&#13;
ICB and LIB; (c) the first two NCB contracts for each works and goods, and all works&#13;
contracts equal or above US$150,000 equivalent, with respect to subprojects; and (d) all&#13;
amendments to works contracts under direct contracting raising the contract value above&#13;
US$35,000 equivalent and under contracts based on quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three domestic contractors raising the contract value about US$50,000 equivalent. Prior&#13;
review by IDA of the selection and hiring of consultants would not be required for (i)&#13;
individual consultants when the contract is valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent, and&#13;
(ii) consulting firms when the contract is valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent. This&#13;
exception does not apply to prior review of terms of reference and single source selection.&#13;
The level of IDA prior review of procurement is relatively low, but is considered&#13;
acceptable in light of the audit arrangements for the project, which include quarterly and&#13;
annual auditing by a qualified external firm, including physical audits of subprojects.&#13;
Periodic project physical performance evaluations would also look at procurement issues&#13;
in the course of random review of subprojects, including field visits. In addition, prior&#13;
review by IDA will be supported by ex-post review of procurement documentation during&#13;
regular and frequent supervision missions (Annex 18).&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
4.12  The proposed project would be implemented over a four-year period, and is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 1999 and closed by December 31, 1999. The&#13;
proceeds of the credit would be disbursed over a 4 1/2 year period as follows: (a)&#13;
subprojects, 96 percent of disbursements by FHIS approved on or before March 31, 1999,&#13;
according to FHIS' project selection and evaluation procedures; (b) vehicles and&#13;
equipment: 100 percent of foreign expenditures for imported goods, 100 percent of total&#13;
expenditures for locally-produced goods (ex-factory cost), and 93 percent of other local&#13;
expenditures; (c) technical assistance: 100 percent of the cost of eligible training,&#13;
workshops, learning materials, and consultant services, and (d) external auditors and&#13;
special independent reviews for FlUS: 100 percent. Retroactive financing of up to US$3.0&#13;
million equivalent would be permitted for eligible expenditures under subprojects incurred&#13;
as of January 1, 1995. This is justified since the second IDA credit was fully committed&#13;
as of the end of 1994, and also other donor funding in early-1995 has been in short supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4.13  Proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against expenditures that&#13;
would be presented to IDA and fully documented for civil works and goods contracts of&#13;
US$150,000 or more and for consultant contracts of US$25,000 or more for individuals&#13;
and US$50,000 or more for firms, subject to prior review (para. 4.11). Claims for&#13;
expenditures under contracts below these amounts would be disbursed against&#13;
presentation of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting&#13;
documentation would be retained by the relevant implementing agencies - FHIS and&#13;
SEDA - for periodic inspection by IDA and by external auditors. In order to facilitate&#13;
project implementation, the Government would establish a special account in US Dollars&#13;
at the Central Bank with an authorized allocation of US$ 2.0 million, representing the&#13;
average of four months of expenditures that are expected to be made from the account.&#13;
The possible need for a separate Special Account for SEDA, to help implement the&#13;
environmental technical assistance component, would be reviewed when the condition for&#13;
this component has been met (para. 4.14(i)). Withdrawals from the Special Account&#13;
would be solely for eligible expenditures under the credit, supported by the required&#13;
documentation, and at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of withdrawal. The&#13;
minimum amount for withdrawal applications submitted outside the Special Account&#13;
would be US$400,000 (20 percent of the authorized allocation).&#13;
4.14  During negotiations. agreement was reached that no disbursements would be made&#13;
under the credit against any environmental technical assistance managed by SEDA until:&#13;
(i) the technical assistance provided under the Environmental Development Project was&#13;
being implemented successfully, and (ii) detailed terms of reference (including design of&#13;
methodologies and materials) had been drafted, and were acceptable to IDA. Similarly, no&#13;
disbursements would be made against any environmental subprojects until the&#13;
environmental subprojects carried out by FHIS on a pilot basis in 20 municipalities under&#13;
the Environmental Development Project were judged to be progressing well (paras. 7.3(a&#13;
and (b)). Also, no disbursements would be made against food expenditures (unless the&#13;
relevant IDA policy were to be changed) (para. 7.3 (c)).&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.15  FHIS and SEDA would maintain records and separate accounts adequate to&#13;
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures of&#13;
the project. During negotiations. agreement was reached that FHIS and SEDA would:&#13;
(a) have the records and accounts of the project for each fiscal year. including the Special&#13;
Account, audited by independent and qualified external auditors, in accordance with&#13;
generally accepted auditing standards and procedures. and terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to IDA: (b) furnish IDA, no later than four months after the end of each year. a certified&#13;
copy of the agreed audit reports: and (c) furnish IDA such other project financing&#13;
information as IDA would from time to time reasonably request (para. 7. I(e)). For all&#13;
expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were made on&#13;
the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), and for all expenditures with respect to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
which withdrawals were made from the Special Account, FHIS and SEDA would provide&#13;
access to the independent auditors to all records, accounts, and the supporting&#13;
documentation necessary to allow the timely performance of their audit obligations. The&#13;
audit reports would include separate opinions on the eligibility of expenditures included in&#13;
the SOEs and on the accuracy and reliability of the SOEs themselves.&#13;
4.16  FHIS' intemal auditing unit is currently being strengthened through staff training;&#13;
additional technical assistance is provided for under the project. With a stronger unit,&#13;
cooperating closely with the external auditor, the role of the external auditor could&#13;
probably be reduced over time. However, during negotiations. it was agreed that, for the&#13;
time being. FHIS' extemal auditor would continue to also carrv out quarterly performance&#13;
audits, combining a financial review with physical inspection of works in the field (para.&#13;
7.1 (f)). Quarterly, the auditor would examine a sample of subprojects, review the&#13;
standard regionalized unit prices, review the individual contracts, ascertain whether the&#13;
terms of these contracts are complied with, inspect the progress of works, reconcile the&#13;
physical progress with the financial expenses incurred, and state whether procurement&#13;
procedures specified in the Credit Agreement have been properly followed. The auditor&#13;
would prepare quarterly reports for the Board of FHIS and for IDA (to be submitted&#13;
within thirty days after each quarter) and an annual summary for IDA, to be submitted&#13;
together with the audit report on the project financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Project Implementation&#13;
5.1   Project Preparation. The project was prepared with technical support from the&#13;
Regional Unit for Technical Assistance in the Social Sectors (RUTA Social) and financing&#13;
from a Government of Japan grant. The FHIS components were designed by EFIIS with&#13;
the help of consultants, the social data component by a group of SECPLAN, FHIS, and&#13;
statistical officials under the coordination of the Vice-Minister of SECPLAN, and the&#13;
environmental component by SEDA with the help of consultants and in consultation with&#13;
FHIS. High-level MOF, SECPLAN, MOE, and MOH officials were consulted at all&#13;
stages of the project cycle, ensuring that the Government's strategies for the sectors are&#13;
reflected in the project design. The experience gained by FHIS from the implementation&#13;
of the earlier IDA, IDB, and KfW-assisted projects and by SEDA in helping to prepare the&#13;
Environmental Development Project were instrumental in helping to prepare their&#13;
respective components. Similarly, the experience of SECPLAN and USAID helped to&#13;
design the social data component. The findings and recommendations of the Public&#13;
Investment Review mission in November/December 1994 set the framework for the total&#13;
budget and social sector investment projections. Based on the review of technical and&#13;
institutional components, and the organizational and staffing changes made in recent&#13;
months, the appraisal mission concluded that project preparation has been completed to an&#13;
advanced stage of readiness for implementation. In addition, with grant funding from&#13;
IDB, some of the consultants required for further strengthening of FHIS' management and&#13;
operations are already being recruited, including a Technical Assistance Coordinator to be&#13;
based in Honduras. Because of the importance of ensuring continued good management&#13;
and operations, FHIS has now filled the remaining vacant senior management positions,&#13;
agreed upon a detailed investment program for 1995 with relevant central and line&#13;
ministries, and revised its Operational Manuals in line with the recommendations made&#13;
during project preparation. During negotiations. FHIS provided assurances that any&#13;
future appointment to the positions of Executive Director. Deputy Executive Director,&#13;
Director of Planning. Director of Projects. Director of Control. Director of Supervision.&#13;
and Director of Administration would be subject to prior IDA consultation (para. 7. 1(g)).&#13;
In addition, a strengthened and simplified Operational Manual would be introduced by no&#13;
later than June 30, 1996. A detailed project implementation schedule is provided in Annex&#13;
16.&#13;
5.2   Project Monitoring. Project implementation of the FHIS components would be&#13;
monitored by FHIS according to performance indicators agreed with IDA (see Annex&#13;
17). '° FHIS would compile semi-annual and annual progress reports, which would be&#13;
jointly discussed with IDA, IDB, and KfW during the project's annual and mid-term&#13;
reviews. In addition, with the help of the technical assistance to be provided for&#13;
10 The key performance monitoring indicators would be subject to review by the consultants to be recruited&#13;
to help improve the management of the subproject cycle, including the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system, and by the consultants who are to work on the MIS system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
strengthening policies and practices for management of the project cycle, FELS would&#13;
elaborate a set of subproject evaluation indicators to evaluate subproject quality and&#13;
impact, including, inter alia, physical progress, employment generated and number of&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
5.3    Annual Implementation Reviews. Annual project reviews would take place in&#13;
November of each year, starting in 1995, and would be conducted jointly by FH[S, IDA,&#13;
IDB, and KfW. During these reviews, the following aspects of the project would be&#13;
analyzed and agreed: (a) financial performance and budget execution against projected&#13;
targets; (b) work plan and budget proposed for the following year; (c) recurrent budget&#13;
implications of FHIS' investments; (d) possible adjustments required in project design and&#13;
implementation schedule; and (e) results of evaluation studies and indicators on subproject&#13;
quality and impact. During negotiations. FHIS provided assurances that: (a) it would&#13;
present to IDA. by October 31 of each year. starting in 1995, annual progress reports on&#13;
the implementation and impact of the project. and the action plan and budget for the next&#13;
year: (b) it would conduct, jointly with IDA. IDB. and KfW. annual project&#13;
implementation reviews by no later than November 30 of each year. starting in 1995: and&#13;
(c) agreements reached at such annual project implementation reviews would be&#13;
implemented expeditiously (para. 7. 1(h)).&#13;
5.4   Mid-term Review. A comprehensive mid-term review would be conducted as&#13;
soon as 50 percent of the credit had been allocated to specific subprojects, or two years&#13;
after effectiveness, whichever comes first, to assess project performance and initial impact,&#13;
in light of project objectives, in addition to the review of activities normally covered under&#13;
annual implementation reviews. The mid-term review would focus on (i) the targeting of&#13;
FIS funds (in order to channel more resources to poorer municipalities; (ii) the&#13;
prioritization of sector investments; (iii) the quality of the ongoing and completed&#13;
subprojects financed by FELS; (iv) the impact of FHIS-financed subprojects; (v) the&#13;
administrative efficiency and the financial soundness of the operations of FHIS; (vi) an&#13;
assessment of the extent to which the experience of FHIS can strengthen municipalities,&#13;
and improve their operations; (vii) an assessment of the relationship of FELS with the line&#13;
ministries (particularly with regard to the prioritization of investments and the maintenance&#13;
of completed subprojects); and (viii) the prospects for the future of FHIS. FELS would be&#13;
responsible for preparing all information, background papers, and reports to be discussed&#13;
during the project reviews, and for recording the minutes of the agreements reached&#13;
during the mid-term review (Annex 18). During negotiations. FHS provided assurances&#13;
that: (a) a mid-term project review would be conducted in November 1997, with IDA.&#13;
IDB. and KfW. under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. to assess project&#13;
performance and impact: and (b) agreements reached at the conclusion of the mid-term&#13;
review would be implemented expeditiously (para. 7.1(i)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
B. Project Supervision&#13;
5.5   The proposed project would require close supervision to avoid the recurrence of&#13;
implementation problems such as those experienced in 1993-1994 (see Annex 18). IDA&#13;
missions would visit a sample of subprojects at least once a year. Supervision&#13;
requirements are estimated at about 17 weeks of headquarters and consultancy staff per&#13;
year. During negotiations. agreement was reached that FHIS would submit to IDA semi-&#13;
annual progress reports (not later than three months after the end of each semester) (para.&#13;
7.1 .(i)), including the following information by region and sector: (a) subprojects&#13;
presented, appraised, in execution, completed, and evaluated ex-post, including number of&#13;
subprojects and beneficiaries, and amounts committed and executed; (b) sources of funds&#13;
for each subproject; (c) FHIS' personnel and consultants, indicating the changes that have&#13;
taken place during the reporting period; and (d) operating costs of FHIS. The reports&#13;
would also include a brief analysis and recommendations based on the key performance&#13;
monitoring indicators (see para. 5.2).&#13;
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
6.1   The project would help reduce poverty through improved access to basic social&#13;
and economic infrastructure and social services in poor areas and for poor communities.&#13;
It would help the Government complete the rehabilitation of long-neglected social&#13;
infrastructure, improve the social and economic conditions of women and indigenous&#13;
groups, and address environmental concerns, and also provide employment generation&#13;
during the economic adjustment period. Establishment of proper social data mapping and&#13;
improved implementation of the household survey and analysis would allow for better&#13;
investment planning and poverty targeting and, thus, assist the Government in obtaining a&#13;
more equitable social expenditure program.&#13;
B. Participation of Women and Indigenous Groups&#13;
6.2   The project would be of benefit to the poorer segments of the population in&#13;
general, and infrastructure subprojects would help both men and women. Traditionally,&#13;
men have enjoyed the benefits of the employment created, but FILS is making an effort,&#13;
with the help of pilot subprojects supported by KfW to promote additional employment&#13;
for women. Also, improved education, health, water, and sanitation services have been of&#13;
particular importance to women. Women would also be expected, as community&#13;
managers, to play an important role in the identification, execution, and maintenance of&#13;
completed works. The basic needs program has traditionally prioritized subprojects&#13;
affecting women, and would be expected to continue to do so. High priority would&#13;
continue to be assigned to training traditional birth attendants and health promoters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
Additional attention would be given to pre-school children of female heads of households&#13;
who have to work to support their families. Finally, the project's technical assistance for&#13;
PASI would include a major component to promote female micro-entrepreneurs.&#13;
6.3   The project would address the needs of indigenous people through infrastructure&#13;
subprojects and a subproject in the basic needs component specifically designed to&#13;
improve communities' well-being. The design of the subproject would be based on the full&#13;
consideration of the options preferred by the indigenous people. FILS has drafted a&#13;
strategy on the approach and types of projects to be pursued in promoting the&#13;
participation of indigenous people.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
6.4   The project would have no significant environmental risks. A General&#13;
Environmental Law was enacted in 1993, which changed the legal, institutional, and&#13;
operational framework for environmental management. The body of laws and regulations&#13;
is still far from consistent or properly harmonized, but this is being pursued under the&#13;
Environmental Development Project. That project is also assisting FILS in revising its&#13;
environmental review mechanism, in line with the new law and regulations, for the pilot&#13;
environmental subprojects. FHIS will use the same screening mechanism for all&#13;
infrastructure subprojects funded under the project and reflect it in its Operational&#13;
Manuals. The process to arrive at a new review mechanism is described in Annex 5. As&#13;
a condition of effectiveness. any revisions to the Operational Manuals requiring approval&#13;
by FHIS' Board would be so approved. This would include appropriate references to the&#13;
use of the revised environmental review mechanism. satisfactory to IDA (para.7.2(b)).&#13;
Additional technical assistance to ensure compliance with environmental norms in FHIS&#13;
subprojects is funded as part of the Environmental Development Project. If this pilot&#13;
proves successful, FHIS would also get involved in environmental promotion activities&#13;
(para. 3.8). An environmental rating of category "B" is agreed.&#13;
D. Project Risks&#13;
6.5   A substantial risk would be possible political interference in FHIS' decision making&#13;
process and a weakening of its management and staff. However, the Government has&#13;
confirmed its commitment to continuing with an independent and strong FHIS,&#13;
complementing the activities of the social line ministries. This has been followed by action&#13;
on a strengthened management team and the continued implementation of agreed&#13;
subproject processing procedures, including the use of sound and transparent targeting&#13;
mechanisms. There is also a risk that, as a maturing organization, FHIS may lose its&#13;
energy, efficiency, and desire to explore new venues. This risk would be mitigated&#13;
through the selection of dynamic management and motivated staff with a clear work&#13;
program. However, an effective FHIS also requires continuous monitoring and evaluation&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
of project inputs and outputs to ensure that it maximizes its contribution to the country's&#13;
poverty alleviation efforts. This would be achieved through improved information, the&#13;
proposed social data mapping, the use of sound and transparent targeting mechanisms, and&#13;
annual investment program revisions with FHIS, relevant government agencies, and the&#13;
major donor agencies.&#13;
E. Poverty Category&#13;
6.6   The project would support a program of targeted interventions. Through the use&#13;
of a targeting formula based on poverty indices (see para. 2.4), the project would channel&#13;
resources especially to the poorest municipalities and, within those municipalities, to the&#13;
poorest districts which are otherwise underserved. A detailed description of the targeting&#13;
is provided in Annex 2. During negotiations, FHIS provided assurances that its revised&#13;
poverty targeting formula would be applied for allocating its 1996 and future resources to&#13;
the municipalities. (para. 7.1 (j).&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   During negotiations agreement was reached that:&#13;
(a)   the Government would provide proposals on the implementation of an&#13;
improved formula for the funding of incremental recurrent expenditures by&#13;
the line ministries, municipalities, and beneficiaries by no later than March&#13;
31, 1996 (para. 4.4);&#13;
(b)   the Government would provide funds as indicated in the project financing&#13;
plan and the means to cover the operating costs of FHIS and the&#13;
incremental recurrent costs of completed FHIS investments (para. 4.6);&#13;
(c)   the Government would sign funding agreements for approximately US$40&#13;
million with IDB, DM 15 million with the Government of the Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany, and US$15.6 million with other donors by March&#13;
31, 1996, or alternative financing would have been arranged (para. 4.6);&#13;
(d)   FHIS would periodically review its standard regionalized unit prices for&#13;
civil works and goods, and change prices promptly, in a form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to IDA, if so recommended by such a review (para.&#13;
4.8);&#13;
(e)   FHIS and SEDA would: (i) have the records and accounts of the project&#13;
for each fiscal year, including the Special Account, audited by independent&#13;
and qualified external auditors, in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
auditing standards and procedures, and terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
IDA; (ii) furnish IDA, no later than four months after the end of each year,&#13;
a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish IDA such other&#13;
project financing information as IDA would from time to time reasonably&#13;
request (para. 4.15);&#13;
(f)   quarterly and annual audits of FHLS would be carried out by private,&#13;
independent external auditors, acceptable to IDA, on the basis of&#13;
acceptable contracts, accounting norms, procedures, and terms of reference&#13;
(para. 4.16);&#13;
(g)   any future appointment to FILS' positions of Executive Director, Deputy&#13;
Executive Director, Director of Projects, Director of Supervision, and&#13;
Director of Administration would be subject to prior IDA consultation&#13;
(para. 5.1);&#13;
(h)   FHIS would (i) submit to IDA, IDB, and KfW semi-annual progress&#13;
reports not later than three months after the end of each semester; (ii)&#13;
present to IDA, IDB and KfW by October 31 of each year, annual progress&#13;
reports on the implementation and impact of the project, and the action&#13;
plan and budget for the next year, starting in 1995; and (iii) conduct, jointly&#13;
with IDA, IDB, and KfW, annual project implementation reviews by&#13;
November 30 of each year, starting in 1995; and that (iv) agreements&#13;
reached by such annual project implementation reviews would be&#13;
implemented expeditiously (para. 5.3 and 5.5);&#13;
(i)   FHIS would conduct a mid-term project review in November 1997, jointly&#13;
with IDA, IDB, and KfW, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, to&#13;
assess project performance and initial impact; and that agreements reached&#13;
at the conclusion of the mid-term review would be implemented&#13;
expeditiously (para. 5.4);&#13;
(i)   EHIIS would apply its revised poverty targeting formula for allocating its&#13;
1996 and future resources to the municipalities (para. 6.6).&#13;
7.2   As conditions of credit effectiveness:&#13;
(a)   a FIHIS Agreement for making the funds available by the Borrower to FHIS&#13;
as well as describing the new arrangements between FHIS, MOE, MOH,&#13;
and the municipalities, satisfactory to IDA, would be entered into (para.&#13;
4.6); and&#13;
(b)   the Operational Manuals would be revised, including appropriate&#13;
references to the use of the revised environmental review mechanism,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
7.3   As conditions of disbursements:&#13;
(a)   for disbursement of funds for environmental technical assistance to the&#13;
municipalities, SEDA would present (i) evidence acceptable to IDA that&#13;
the corresponding technical assistance provided under the Environmental&#13;
Development Project was being implemented successfully; and (ii) detailed&#13;
terms of reference for the technical assistance (including design of&#13;
methodologies and materials), acceptable to IDA (para. 4.14);&#13;
(b)   for disbursement of funds for environmental subprojects, FHIS would&#13;
present evidence acceptable to IDA that the pilot environmental projects&#13;
funded under the Environmental Development Project were progressing&#13;
well (para. 4.14); and&#13;
(c)   no disbursements would be made against food expenditures (para. 4.14).&#13;
7.4   Recommendation. Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 19.1 million (US$30.0 million&#13;
equivalent) to the Republic of Honduras, to be repaid on standard IDA terms with 40&#13;
years maturity, including 10 years of grace.&#13;

SOCIAL SECTOR DATA AND REQUIREMENTS&#13;
I.     The following describes the demand for infrastructure in education, health, and water&#13;
supply and sanitation in Honduras.&#13;
EDUCATION&#13;
2.     There are still major problems with infrastructure.  In the first place, the current&#13;
facilities can only cover about 90 percent of potential primary school students. In addition,&#13;
coverage is biased against the poor. As a consequence, there is a need for a substantial&#13;
program of civil works, but carefully planned as part of a larger plan of action to improve the&#13;
quality and efficiency of the education system. Table I below presents the state of the&#13;
physical infrastructure as of 1993.&#13;
3.     Priority for the construction of  new  educational facilities should be given to&#13;
classrooms where the community is involved, and has expressed a formal conmmitment to&#13;
maintain them. Once this is accomplished, the ranking should be as follows: (a) rehabilitate&#13;
classrooms in the worst condition (bad); and (b) rehabilitate classrooms in fair condition. In&#13;
both cases, priority should be given to schools with the highest student-classroom ratios.&#13;

4.     Table  2  shows estimates  of the  necessary  construction, reconstruction, and&#13;
rehabilitation of classrooms for the next four years. New classrooms are required to serve the&#13;
following population groups':&#13;
(a) children between seven and 12 years of age, who cannot attend school at present&#13;
because of lack of space. This potential demand is found principally in rural areas and&#13;
in municipalities with less population and higher rates of illiteracy;&#13;
(b) children between seven and 12 years of age, who will add to the total because of the&#13;
population growth projected between 1994 and 1999. This population is concentrated&#13;
principally in the poorer parts of the larger cities; and&#13;
(c) children in schools with more than 60 students and only one teacher and one&#13;
classroom  (estimated at 980).  With the Basic Education Project assisting the&#13;
construction of 290 classrooms, there remain 690 to be constructed.&#13;

/I The annual growth rate of the population for this age group is calculated on the basis of the population&#13;
projections made by SECPLAN/ILO/FNUAP, September 1992.&#13;

/3 Calculated on the basis of information on the condition of classrooms in fair or bad state&#13;
(as of September 1993).&#13;
5.     As shown in the table, there is a total need of about 3,158 new classrooms and of the&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation of about 11,800 classrooms. The total cost is estimated at&#13;
The number of children is divided by 43, which is the average number of students/classroom reported by&#13;
the Ministry of Education.&#13;

US$61 million. In addition, there is a need for the reparation and rehabilitation of school&#13;
toilets and bathrooms, as well as the provision of furniture.&#13;
HEALTH&#13;
6.    The Ministry of Health (MOH) has a good network of primary care.  For&#13;
administrative purposes, the country has been divided into eight regions. In 1993, there were&#13;
seven national hospitals, seven regional hospitals, 15 area hospitals, 197 health centers&#13;
(Centros de Salid con Medico (CESAMOS)), 609 rural health centers (Centros de Salud&#13;
Rural (CESAR)), and four maternal-infant clinics (a total of 839 official State medical centers&#13;
and 10 from the private sector). The principal problem with the construction of physical&#13;
infrastructure in health is the recurrent cost in terms of maintenance and personnel. No center&#13;
should be built if there is no assurance as to the financing of the recurrent costs. MOH has&#13;
therefore decided to give priority to the rehabilitation and repair of existing centers.&#13;
7.    From  a geographical coverage point of view, it is estimated that MOH's health&#13;
network covers 60 percent of the country. According to the Household Survey of 1992, 78&#13;
percent of the people who had problems with health were attended by some public health&#13;
center. In terms of physical facilities, it is estimated that it will be necessary to substitute,&#13;
repair, or rehabilitate 40 centers. It is assumed that the useful life of the centers will be an&#13;
average of 20 years, and that the civil works will cost about US$3.2 million.&#13;
WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION&#13;
8.    The National Autonomous Water and Sewerage Service (SANAA) has failed to&#13;
provide adequate outreach to the rural and peri-urban communities3, and the country's water&#13;
supply and sanitation are inefficient and inequitable. The poor pay many times more (up to&#13;
77) for each cubic meter than families with medium incomes. Water is rationed throughout&#13;
the country, but particularly in the rural sector; and its supply is precarious. The service&#13;
coverage of the system is 70 percent of the population;4 90 percent of the urban and 54&#13;
percent of the rural population are connected to water (3.5 million total residents). However,&#13;
only 17 percent of the population receives safe drinking water.&#13;
9.    For small civil works, such as for wells and small aqueducts, the most important point&#13;
is to guarantee maintenance, and teach the communities to operate the water system and to&#13;
guard the sources of water.  It is important to obtain the formal participation of the&#13;
communities to guarantee the sustainability of the works. In Honduras, this type of action has&#13;
been and is accomplished through the establishment of community water boards.&#13;
3  This is currently being reviewed as part of a sector study funded by the Bank and UNDP, which may be&#13;
followed up by a joint IDA-IDB Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Adjustment Project.&#13;

10.    The needs in this subsector are great, with the main responsibility in the hands of the&#13;
municipalities. This is an important area of action for FHIS, particularly in rural areas. If it&#13;
were decided to establish in the rural areas house connections for 1.5 million people, or more&#13;
than 300,000 families, over the next four years, at a cost-per-beneficiary of US$18, it would&#13;
cost at least US$27 million. It should be taken into account, however, that the costs will&#13;
increase with the increasing difficulty of access. The total cost is still relatively small given the&#13;
importance of the service and its effect on health and productivity, but the most complex task&#13;
is to assure that completed civil works are maintained and that water is purified. (The&#13;
Government of Spain is considering the coverage of urban demand through a program of&#13;
potable water plants, covering about 1.2 million users from small cities.)&#13;
11.    Basic Sanitation. Conventional sewerage systems cover only about 25 percent, and&#13;
are concentrated in the urban areas. In the rural areas, conventional sanitation is practically&#13;
non-existent. The disposal of excreta is realized in most of the country through the use of&#13;
latrines, which cover about 37.5 percent of the population.5 Nevertheless, deficiencies in the&#13;
construction and maintenance of latrines have, on occasion, caused problems with&#13;
contamination, misuse, and early deterioration.&#13;
12.    Table 3 shows the annual construction of latrines. The total stock of about 230,000&#13;
implies the construction of about 46,000 latrines annually just for maintenance 6. As a result,&#13;
there is a need for at least 50,000 latrines each year over the next four years, costing US$25&#13;
million.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
FLIS POVERTY TARGETING&#13;
1.    The current formnula used by FHIS to determine the amount of funds available for&#13;
investment in each of the 18 departments and 293 municipalities is based on population,&#13;
and then adjusted according to a poverty index, which is composed of three indicators&#13;
(weights in the index are shown in parentheses): water supply (.5); malnutrition (.3), and&#13;
sanitation (.2). The water supply indicator represents the proportion of the population&#13;
without access to piped water within 100 meters of their home. The malnutrition indicator&#13;
represents the weighted sum of the proportion of the population, which is severely&#13;
malnourished (.5), moderately malnourished (.3), and slightly malnourished (.2). The&#13;
sanitation indicator is the weighted sum of the proportion of the population with no&#13;
sanitation system (.5), those with a simple latrine (.3), and those with a hydraulic latrine&#13;
(.2). The data used to calculate these indicators are from the 1988 population census, and&#13;
from an anthropometric census of school children in 1987-88.&#13;
2.    Beginning with the 1996 allocation, FHIS will modify the targeting formula in two&#13;
ways. First, an indicator of access to educational services will be incorporated into the&#13;
poverty index. As shown in the appendix, a brief examination of departments ranked by&#13;
the FHIS poverty index and then by illiteracy rates demonstrates substantial differences.&#13;
Since more than half of total FHIS investments to date have been in educational&#13;
infrastructure, the incorporation of illiteracy would allow the poverty index to more&#13;
accurately reflect deficiencies in areas where FHLS investment is likely to be strong. The&#13;
latest illiteracy figures available are from the 1988 population census. Second, the final&#13;
allocation will be adjusted for regional differences in construction costs, so that FHIS&#13;
funds will have the same real purchasing power across municipalities. The impact of&#13;
adjusting the allocation for variations in regional costs for actual FHIS subprojects has&#13;
been tested, and shows that only two departments (with very small populations) had&#13;
significant differences in construction costs, and therefore the overall distribution of funds&#13;
changed very little. However, the allocation of FHIS funds to these two departments rose&#13;
significantly, by 40 percent (Gracias a Dios) and 70 percent (Islas de la Bahia),&#13;
respectively.&#13;
3.    Once the social data mapping system (described in Annex I 1) becomes available, it&#13;
will provide an additional tool with which to improve the accuracy of the FHIS poverty&#13;
targeting formula. One of the main weaknesses of the current formula is that it is based&#13;
largely on data from 1988, and thus does not control for the ongoing impact of FHIS&#13;
investments on access to social services. Since the new maps will be regularly updated&#13;
with information on completed FHIS (and line ministry) subprojects, it will provide the&#13;
information required to calculate up-to-date "deficiency rates" in education, health, water&#13;
and sanitation services, and thus to periodically adjust the targeting formula.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.    So far, community participation at all stages of FIlLS' sub project cycle has been&#13;
insufficient. Earlier, beneficiary organizations were rarely involved in the identification of&#13;
the works, and were excluded almost entirely from the subproject design and execution&#13;
stages. By minimizing community involvement, FHIS was able to spend money quickly,&#13;
but the consequence has been a number of finished subprojects that are either not working&#13;
for lack of resources to cover operational costs, or are falling into disrepair because the&#13;
subproject beneficiaries have not assumed the responsibility to undertake maintenance.&#13;
2.   FHIS has now recognized the weaknesses inherent in the previous approach, and&#13;
has responded with a broadly-based set of initiatives. Reforms of the management of the&#13;
promotion, evaluation, contracting, and execution stages of the subproject cycle have been&#13;
introduced with a view to improving subproject sustainability. A new department of&#13;
Social Participation has been created. A pilot project designed to demonstrate how&#13;
subproject sustainability can be achieved was launched in October 1994, and covers health&#13;
center projects located in Tegucigalpa. Further, guidelines have been drawn up to&#13;
contract NGOs in the first instance, but with the intention of including other development&#13;
actors in the future, to execute subprojects that promote social participation. In addition,&#13;
FHIS is awaiting the results of the KfW-financed, UNICEF-executed, monitoring exercise&#13;
designed to identify the factors enhancing sustainability of water and sanitation, health,&#13;
and education projects. Finally, FIlS is also involved in three municipal development&#13;
initiatives designed to build local level subproject management and planning capacity;&#13;
these are the USAID-financed municipal development program, the UNICEF-inspired&#13;
"Pacto de la Infancia", and FIRS' own proposal to undertake municipal development&#13;
activities to promote the sustainability of its subprojects.&#13;
3.    These are clearly steps in the right direction, but need further work with regard to:&#13;
the subproject cycle and minor adjustments that can be made to introduce beneficiary&#13;
participation at all stages of decision making; the FHIS initiatives to introduce&#13;
sustainability into projects; and the programs to build local level capacity. To assist FIlS'&#13;
management, the project would provide technical assistance for community participation&#13;
and local level capacity building.&#13;
4.    The effort at community participation would also be helped through the new&#13;
agreement between FHIS and the US Peace Corps for cooperation initially in the water&#13;
supply, sanitation, and micro credit sectors. Under this agreement, the Peace Corps&#13;
volunteers could assist with:&#13;
Promotion and community organization.&#13;
Identification and/or preparation of subprojects.&#13;

HONDURAS TEIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
SUBPROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    The environmental assessment rating for this project is category "B", since certain&#13;
types of subprojects eligible for financing under the project, such as road construction and&#13;
maintenance, bridge construction, water supply and sewerage works, and solid waste&#13;
facilities, have potentially significant adverse environmental impacts that should be&#13;
avoided or mitigated.&#13;
2.    Under the Environmental Development Project (EDP), FHIS has hired consultants&#13;
to develop an environmental review mechanism for all subprojects which it finances&#13;
(independent of subproject category or funding source). The mechanism will be consistent&#13;
with the provisions of the "National Environmental Impact Assessment System"&#13;
regulation to the 1993 General Environmental Law.&#13;
3.    A random sample of 72 completed FHIS subprojects was selected for ex-post&#13;
environmental audits. The subprojects were distributed throughout the country and were&#13;
selected from all the subproject categories with potentially adverse environmental impacts.&#13;
All 72 subprojects were visited by February 1995. Based on the results of the audit, the&#13;
consultants have formulated a draft proposal for an efficient environmental review&#13;
mechanism. It is anticipated that the main elements of the mechanism will be:&#13;
(a)   Questionnaires or check-lists specific to each subproject category, which&#13;
will be used as a screening tool;&#13;
(b)   Depending on the answers to the questionnaire, and on guidelines added to&#13;
the Operation Manual, the subproject could either require a formal&#13;
environmental impact assessment, a rapid environmental review or no&#13;
further environmental evaluation; and&#13;
(c)   Inclusion of environmental criteria in subproject supervision and&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
4.    It is also anticipated that, as a result of the environrental audits, certain subproject&#13;
category guidelines and specifications will be amended to prevent the most common&#13;
environmental problems identified during the audits.&#13;
5.    The consultants presented FHIS with a proposed mechanism at the end of March&#13;
1995. It is anticipated that the mechanism will be in place and reflected in the Operational&#13;
Manual in June/July, after review and approval by FHIS and SEDA, followed by training&#13;
of the staff in FHIS responsible for its day-to-day implementation. Its reflection in the&#13;
Operational Manual would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.&#13;

SUBPROJECT PROPOSALS AND 1995 PROGRAM&#13;
1.    As detailed in Appendix 1, FHIS now has a sizable subproject pipeline, which has been&#13;
awaiting funding. As of April 28, 1995, it had an active pipeline of 1483 infrastructure&#13;
subprojects and 279 basic needs projects, amounting to the equivalent of US$42.0 million and&#13;
US$3.8 million, respectively. Taking into account the existing applications, a recently started&#13;
aggressive promotion effort, and FHIS' substantial processing capacity, there is little doubt&#13;
that FHIS can, and should, process the equivalent of US$25 million per year, on average, over&#13;
the period 1995-1999.&#13;
2.    Now that funding will be forthcoming, FHlIS' management is working out a more&#13;
detailed work program for 1995, to be reflected in Appendix 2 to this Annex, and to be&#13;
agreed with IDA as a condition of negotiations. Traditionally, most projects have been in the&#13;
education and health sectors, and relatively little in the more complicated water supply and&#13;
sanitation sectors, but with virtually no new schools and health centers and an increasing need&#13;
in water supply and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, the latter are expected to take an&#13;
increasing share of FHIS' investment portfolio (see Annex 1). The share of basic needs&#13;
subprojects will be reduced considerably. First, school desks and latrines will become part of&#13;
education and health infrastructure, respectively. Second, with most of the country's nutrition&#13;
needs covered by PRAF, relatively little will be required from FHIS. And third, FHIS will&#13;
reassess its basic needs program (see Annex 9). Technical assistance would be provided&#13;
under the project for further development of the basic needs program.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
COOPERATION WITH LINE MINISTRIES AND MUNICIPALITIES&#13;
1.    Since 1990, FHIS has entered into formal agreements with other institutions,&#13;
among them line ministries, the Association of Municipalities of Honduras (AMHON), and&#13;
NGOs, and is now in the process of drafting new agreements with a host of other agencies&#13;
(see Appendix).&#13;
2.    FEHS has entered into several agreements with the MOH to implement activities&#13;
related to health infrastructure, training of midwives, and latrine installation. These&#13;
documents serve to define the responsibilities of each party to the agreement for specific&#13;
activities.&#13;
3.    FLIS has also entered into specific agreements with the MOE to implement&#13;
activities related to education infrastructure and furniture included in externally financed&#13;
projects. These agreements spell out the responsibilities of each party signatory to the&#13;
agreement, such as provision of teachers by MOE for each new classroom that FHIS&#13;
builds.&#13;
4.    While entering into these agreements with the line ministries has been a positive&#13;
effort, the agreements have so far not helped to resolve the main issue, which is the inter-&#13;
institutional coordination required for purposes of planning, programming, and&#13;
establishing responsibility for the definition of technical norms. The line ministries have&#13;
not yet been able to provide FHIS with the information on sector priorities by&#13;
geographical location, nor have the institutions formally agreed on the adequacy of&#13;
technical designs.&#13;
5.    However, the social sector ministries, through support received under the&#13;
Institutional Strengthening components of the Nutrition and Health and Basic Education&#13;
Projects, as well as the Public Sector Modernization project and the recent IDF grant for&#13;
Institutional Strengthening of the Social Sector Ministries, will be able to improve their&#13;
planning capacity so that they can define and plan priority investments and provide this&#13;
information to FHIS at periodic intervals. MOE and SECPLAN have already developed a&#13;
data base that contains sufficient information to determine current education investment&#13;
priorities by geographical location. MOH has also developed a mapping system that can&#13;
be used to determine current health investment priorities. In addition, SECPLAN is&#13;
putting in place a program to monitor investments in the social sectors. All of these&#13;
efforts, coordinated and supported further under the proposed project, will facilitate not&#13;
only the planning and programming of activities of these ministries, but also make FHIS'&#13;
investment projects respond to the sectors' needs in the poorest regions of Honduras.&#13;
6.    With regard to the definition of technical norms for infrastructure, designs are now&#13;
available in the sectoral ministries, and these would be given to FHIS to use for its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                 ANNEX 7&#13;

contracts. In addition, a unit to be set up at MOE with support under the Basic Education&#13;
Project will monitor and review all education subprojects. Pre-approval by the MOE unit&#13;
is a pre-condition for FHIS financing any education subproject. MOE norms are expected&#13;
to cover new schools, expansions, rehabilitation, maintenance and school furniture (at the&#13;
pre-primary through secondary level) as well as community and municipal participation.&#13;
Equally important, given functions assigned to FERS by the Govermnent, phasing out&#13;
MOE School Construction Department is planned. The timing for this action will ensure&#13;
completion of on-going works financed by other donors, but new financing for education&#13;
infrastructure is expected to be channeled through FFHS. A small physical planning unit&#13;
will be created at MOE, possibly in the Planning Department, to: (a) monitor FHIS&#13;
compliance with MOE norms; (b) improve upon existing MOE norms; (c) assist&#13;
municipalities in taking over routine maintenance of schools; and (d) carry out school&#13;
maintenance activities at municipalities unable to do so by themselves.&#13;
7.    The proposed project will be guided by new agreements, which will define&#13;
institutional coordination; ensuring that the line ministries retain the responsibility for&#13;
defining sector priorities and technical norms. They will include references to the line&#13;
ministries' responsibilities for maintenance should this not be done by the municipalities or&#13;
communities. In addition, MOE will continue to be responsible for staffing the extra&#13;
classrooms.&#13;
8.    In mid-1994, FHIS entered into an umbrella agreement with the AMIION on&#13;
municipal infrastructure and its funding. The agreement provided for counterpart funding&#13;
by the municipalities: 25 percent of the subproject cost for the poorest municipalities and&#13;
up to 50 percent for the relatively more well-to-do municipalities. However, because of&#13;
insufficient municipal resources, these clauses are not yet operational.&#13;
9.    FHIS has prepared a model contract, which each of the country's 293&#13;
municipalities would have to sign, covering all parties' responsibilities, including the&#13;
possible funding of maintenance of completed education and health subprojects (60&#13;
percent by the municipalities and 40 percent by the beneficiaries).&#13;
10.   A recent draft agreement between FHIS and the US Peace Corps would provide&#13;
for cooperation in the water supply, sanitation, and micro credit sectors. Projects&#13;
designed with the assistance of Peace Corps volunteers would be eligible for FHIS&#13;
funding, and Peace Corps volunteers could participate in FHIS activities (see Annex 4).&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE SUBPROJECTS COMPONENT&#13;
Water Supplv and Sanitation Subwroiects&#13;
1.    The water and sanitation program is still being worked out, but could cover:&#13;
(i)   annual construction of about 18,000 latrines;&#13;
(ii)   annual construction of 100 community-level water systems&#13;
(including 30 percent rehabilitation of existing system); and&#13;
(iii)   annual installation of low-cost water systems in 100 communities&#13;
(based on hand -- or where necessary electric -- pumps or public&#13;
standpipes).&#13;
2.    There is no question that the use of low-cost appropriate technologies has been&#13;
under-represented in FIlS subprojects to date. However, FHIS is now prepared to take&#13;
more control, through its pre-investment program, over the design standards for water&#13;
supply subprojects, and proposes to insist on more solutions which can be effectively&#13;
operated and maintained at the community level. This is likely to be a process which will&#13;
evolve slowly over the next year. More detail is provided in the Appendix to this Annex.&#13;
3.    The use of handpumps has been accepted by FHIS as a valuable and low-cost&#13;
methodology for improving access to safe water supplies in the rural areas, whilst also&#13;
engendering community participation and promoting self-sufficiency. However, before&#13;
launching into a handpump campaign, FHIS will have to consider:&#13;
(a)   the identification of adequate and safe supplies of groundwater to ensure&#13;
the long-term success of these subprojects; and&#13;
(b)   the drilling of deep boreholes in areas where hand-dug wells would prove&#13;
too difficult or too dangerous.&#13;
4.    The installation of latrines will need ongoing review. They are the easiest items to&#13;
install, but the most under-utilized if not accompanied by adequate community training&#13;
and education. The demand for latrines remains very high; it is estimated nationally to&#13;
stand at over 142,000 new units, with perhaps as many as 46,000 additional replacement&#13;
units needed per year for latrines which have deteriorated beyond repair (assuming a 5-&#13;
year useable design life). The current installation capacity of FHIS is some 18,000 units&#13;
per year (conducted in three 4-month cycles), representing an investment of about US$3&#13;
million per year. Accordingly, this rate would have to be more than doubled if all of this&#13;
demand were to be satisfied during the four-year project. All future models will be based&#13;
on the Ventilated Imported Pit (VIP) Latrine. Costs for these latrines range from US$125&#13;
to US$200 per installed unit, but the costs of community training and hygiene education&#13;
components can raise the total cost to US$165. Thus, the overall financial requirement&#13;
amounts to almost US$25 million in order to meet the full demand for new units and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                                     ANNEX S&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
about US$7.5 million per year if replacement of the depreciated stock is to be included as&#13;
well. FHIS' experience with conventional sewerage networks and communal treatment&#13;
systems has not been entirely successful, so these should be avoided.&#13;
5.     FMIS is also keen to generate a portfolio of subprojects which concentrate on&#13;
repairing or expanding existing water supply systems. This type of subproject also has the&#13;
advantage of large and immediate increases in coverage for a relatively small investment.&#13;
6.     To help FHIS implement a larger and better water supply and sanitation program,&#13;
the project would provide up to 12 months of technical assistance.'&#13;
Environmental Subprojects.&#13;
7.     Environmental subprojects within the current standard FIS menu, such as&#13;
latrines, would be eligible for financing under the proposed project. New environmental&#13;
subprojects would be tested on a pilot basis under the Environmental Development Project&#13;
(EDP) in 20 municipalities and would include the following:&#13;
SUBPROJECT TYPE                        SUBPROJECT CATEGORY&#13;
Urban and community parks              *  Construction and rehabilitation of urban and&#13;
community parks&#13;
Solid and liquid waste management      *  Urban and small industry solid waste collection,&#13;
processing, disposal, and recycling&#13;
*  Septic tanks and oxidation ponds&#13;
Soil protection                        *  Planting and maintenance of wind breaks&#13;
*  Construction of erosion prevention drainage ditches&#13;
and other minor infrastructure&#13;
Biodiversity conservation              *  Community and family operated ecotourism facilities&#13;
in and around protected areas&#13;
* Posting boundary of demarcated protected areas&#13;
* Small infrastructure for the sustainable management&#13;
and rehabilitation of community and traditional fishing&#13;
operations&#13;
Energy generation and conservation     *  Alternative energy generation initiatives (e.g. wind,&#13;
solar)&#13;
*  Construction of high efficiency wood-burning stoves&#13;
and ovens&#13;
FEIS will also benefit from the findings and recommendations of an ongoing study on the reform of&#13;
water and sanitation in rural and semi-urban areas. This study is financed by the World Bank and UNDP,&#13;
and will look into community participation, organization for sustainability, funding, sanitation and gender&#13;
training, protection of micro-basins and wells, low-cost technologies, and operational relations between&#13;
communities, municipalities, ministries, and NGOs. It should provide a directory of contractors, case&#13;
studies on replicable self-sustaining systems, a map of coverage and investment priorities, and a national&#13;
information system.&#13;

8.    Some of these could be incorporated into the standard menu, and become eligible&#13;
for funding under the project subject to:&#13;
(a)   Standard documents having been developed, inter alia technical&#13;
specifications, and evaluation guidelines, and activity-cost tables; and&#13;
(b)   At least two subprojects in each new subproject category to be included in&#13;
the menu having been completed, and receiving a favorable evaluation&#13;
under the terms agreed for the EDP between the Government and IDA.&#13;
9.    This mechanism would provide sufficient flexibility for the financing of robust&#13;
environmental subprojects.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
LOW-COST WATER SUPPLY &amp; SANITATION COMPONENTS FOR FHIS&#13;
The following is a list of possible additional and low-cost water supply and sanitation&#13;
subprojects. These types of subprojects would ensure that FHIS is reaching the areas of&#13;
Honduras where the need for safe water supplies and hygienic sanitary conditions is&#13;
greatest, whilst ensuring that the communities are involved in the operation and&#13;
maintenance of their own systems. These projects are not appropriate for urban areas,&#13;
they do not involve major construction works, and they do not require any future support&#13;
from SANAA in terns of operation and maintenance, tariff-setting, etc.:&#13;
* Simple Handpumps installed in shallow hand-dug wells&#13;
(e.g., the Bomba Maya manufactured in Guatemala or the Catracha manufactured in&#13;
Nicaragua).&#13;
* Simple Handpumps installed in deep hand-dug wells and boreholes (up to 10 meters&#13;
deep)&#13;
(e.g., the Camisa and Rope Pump manufactured in Honduras).&#13;
- Heavy-Duty Handpumps (or where necessary electric pumps) installed in deep&#13;
boreholes&#13;
(e.g., the Afridev and India MkII imported by UNICEF).&#13;
* Simple Gravity-Fed water supply systems with public standpipes (piletasp6blicas)&#13;
(Low-cost installation, very low consumption rates: 10 to 15 liters/person/day).&#13;
* Installation of Chorinators in existing water supply systems&#13;
(particularly effective in areas with high incidences of gastro-enterric diseases, e.g.,&#13;
cholera).&#13;
* Repair of Existing Systems&#13;
(Rapid results for increasing coverage statistics for minimal intervention).&#13;
* Expansion of Existing Systems&#13;
(Addition of storage tanks, network extensions, public standpipes increases coverage).&#13;
* Upgrading of Existing Systems&#13;
(Providing additional capacity, coverage, and quality to improve overall service).&#13;
* Training for Rural Technicans to provide regional, mobile technical support&#13;
specialists.&#13;
(e.g., the American Circuit Riders program implemented by USAID in northem&#13;
Honduras as TOMs - Tecnicos en Operaci on y Mantenimiento).&#13;

THIRD HONDURAS SOCIAL iNVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
BASIC NEEDS PROGRAM COMPONENT&#13;
1. The basic needs program objectives are to improve the living condition of vulnerable&#13;
social groups, complement MOH and MOE actions through activities of direct benefit to&#13;
vulnerable populations, and support social assistance subprojects executed by NGOs that&#13;
target vulnerable groups. Target groups include malnourished children under six years of&#13;
age, children ages six to 12 years in precarious conditions, pregnant and nursing mothers,&#13;
ethnic minorities, the disabled, and the elderly. From 1990 to the present, the basic needs&#13;
program funded 1,432 subprojects with approved financing in the amount of about L 12.8&#13;
million. Forty-two NGOs (37 national, five international) executed 646 subprojects or 45&#13;
percent of the total. The remaining subprojects were executed by religious organizations,&#13;
community groups, municipalities, social ministries, or individual contractors.&#13;
2. The current portfolio contains 19 subproject types: traditional midwife training,&#13;
creation and development of maternal enterprises (EMMAs), integrated attention to street&#13;
children, non-formal preschool education centers, integrated attention to the disabled,&#13;
integrated attention to the elderly, infant feeding, school breakfasts, mini-farms and school&#13;
gardens, basic health training, community health education, integrated community&#13;
development for ethnic groups, early child development, support to primary education,&#13;
hospital and health center equipment, emergency rotating fund for flood relief, preschool&#13;
equipment and furniture, and school desks. In terms of financing, the most important&#13;
component has been school desks. Twenty-four NGOs executed 559 school desk&#13;
subprojects, or 86 percent of the total number of NGO subprojects. The main benefit in&#13;
contracting NGOs to produce school desks was that a large-scale government project&#13;
achieved nation-wide coverage at a relatively small cost to the Government. One problem&#13;
encountered with NGO participation was that not all NGOs delivered school desks&#13;
directly to schools as mandated; therefore, these subprojects cannot be closed.&#13;
3. So far, complete evaluation of the basic needs program has not been conducted, and&#13;
relatively little information exists on the results of NGO participation. Mid-term&#13;
evaluations of a small sample of NGO-executed maternal enterprise subprojects&#13;
(EMMAs), Centers for Non-Formal Preschool Education (CEPENFs), and garden and&#13;
micro-farm subprojects showed that: (i) NGOs correctly selected beneficiaries according&#13;
to subproject criteria; (ii) subproject design was often flawed due to insufficient&#13;
consultation with social ministries, NGOs, and communities; (iii) subproject supervision&#13;
was hampered by the fact that FHIS lacked supervisors with experience in social&#13;
subprojects; (iv) where subproject objectives were not clearly stated, subprojects could&#13;
not be evaluated; and (v) subproject sustainability was more likely to occur in areas where&#13;
the NGO implementing agency maintained a permanent presence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67                                 ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
4. An internal FS report on basic needs program activities found three problems with&#13;
program implementation. First, the number of technical program staff was insufficient.&#13;
Second, timely assistance was not forthcoming from other FHIS units. For example,&#13;
subprojects were promoted, evaluated, and approved in a relatively short time, but&#13;
subproject start-up was delayed for as long as three months. Third, disbursements were&#13;
not always rapid or opportune. The report recommended that the selection of subproject&#13;
executors should be more rigorous, FHIS supervision personnel should be experienced in&#13;
the evaluation of social subprojects, an efficient MIS for subprojects was needed, the&#13;
program should be fully staffed, and new FH1S personnel should receive training from the&#13;
program and other relevant FIHIS units. This is now being addressed by FIHS'&#13;
management.&#13;
5. There is now agreement between FHIS and the donors on:&#13;
(a)   limiting the program to high priority social needs of a national&#13;
nature;&#13;
(b)   rationalizing the subproject composition, including transferring&#13;
latrine, health center furniture, and school desk subprojects to&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(c)   eliminating possible overlap with other programs, such as PRAF's&#13;
nutrition activities;&#13;
(d)   including priority needs identified by the indigenous population&#13;
during the ongoing discussions between the Government and&#13;
representative organizations of indigenous peoples; and&#13;
(e)   defining the justification and possible scope of emergency&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
6. Based on this agreement, the project would provide for funding up to 5 percent of&#13;
FilS' total investment program over the next four years. The project would also provide&#13;
some technical assistance to help FHIS' management implement its revised program of&#13;
priority basic needs.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCLAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
INST1IUTIONAL STRENGTHENING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
COMPONENT&#13;
1.    In view of the need to assist FHIS' management in (i) overcoming remaining&#13;
organizational and operational problems and (ii) moving into new directions, the project would&#13;
provide for a substantial program of technical assistance, as detailed below.'&#13;
Manaeement of the Subiroiect Cycle&#13;
2.    Four consultants would be made available for a total of 16 person-months to help&#13;
strengthen EHIS' policies and practices for the management of its production line / subproject&#13;
cycle in all of its phases, from work program planning to the identification, appraisal, contracting,&#13;
supervision, and evaluation of subprojects. Consultants would carry out analysis and make&#13;
recommendations on organizational structure, manuals, staffing, and training requirements.&#13;
Trainin2 Proerams for Management and Staff&#13;
3.    This subcomponent would provide for seminars, training courses, and visits to and from&#13;
other regional SIFs, in order to strengthen FHIS' management and to train staff in the new&#13;
policies and practices emerging from the study on management of the subproject cycle (para. 2).&#13;
Accounting and Internal Auditing&#13;
4.    Two consultants for a total of six months would help FlHIS strengthen its accounting and&#13;
internal auditing systems, with the objective of increasing transparency and reliability in the&#13;
management of funds.&#13;
Personnel Systems&#13;
5.    Two personnel experts would assist FHIS for a total of four months to advise on: (i)&#13;
selection and contracting of personnel; (ii) remuneration; (iii) performance evaluation; and (iv)&#13;
promotion and incentives. The consultants would also review and advise on the recommendations&#13;
emerging from the study on management of the subproject cycle (para. 2) with respect to staffing&#13;
and training requirements, and organizational structure.&#13;
X In addition, FIllS would benefit from an ongoing study of water supply and sanitation in rural and semi-urban&#13;
areas (financed by the Bank and UNDP), a proposed study of the future role of FHIS and its relationship with the&#13;
line ministries (financed under the joint IDA-IDB Public Sector Modernization Project), and a proposed study of&#13;
decentralization and municipal development (financed by Ruta Social).&#13;

MIS&#13;
6.    This component would comprise two phases. In the first phase, two experts in&#13;
information systems would provide a total of about four months of assistance to advise FHIS'&#13;
management on the definition, development, and production of information and reports needed to&#13;
manage and monitor the institution's achievement of its objectives; information needs would be&#13;
determined in coordination with FHIS management and the consultants making recommendations&#13;
on the subproject cycle (para. 2). In a second phase, one consultant would provide about two&#13;
months of assistance to advise FHIS on the necessary incremental hardware, software, and&#13;
training requirements to produce the above-mentioned reports, as well as to carry out the&#13;
recommendations emanating from the studies on management of the subproject cycle and on&#13;
accounting and internal auditing.&#13;
Basic Needs&#13;
7.    A social scientist with experience in the design and evaluation of social welfare type basic&#13;
needs subprojects, would assist FHiS for a period of about two months in the development of its&#13;
basic needs component (see Annex 9)&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
8.    A social scientist specializing in community participation in small-scale infrastructure&#13;
subprojects would provide about two months of assistance to help FHIS in all aspects of the&#13;
development of its model of social participation (see Annex 4).&#13;
Financin2 Mechanisms for Maintenance&#13;
9.    Two consultants would provide a total of about six months of assistance to advise on the&#13;
implementation of the Government's decision that the municipalities assume all or most of the&#13;
costs of maintenance for FHIS education and health subprojects. The consultants would make&#13;
recommendations regarding appropriate and feasible financing arrangements among central&#13;
government actors (line ministries and other social sector agencies), municipalities and&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
Cooperation with US Peace Corps&#13;
10.   To help implement the proposed agreement between FHIS and the Peace Corps on&#13;
cooperation in the fields of water supply and sanitation and micro credit development, Peace&#13;
Corps volunteers and their Honduran counterparts would join special workshops to acquaint them&#13;
with FHIS policies and procedures, which should enable them to assist community participation at&#13;
all stages of FHIS' subproject cycle (see Annex 4).&#13;

11..  A civil/sanitary engineer, specializing in low-cost water and sanitation projects, would&#13;
assist FHIS for one year in all aspects of the development of their water supply and sanitation&#13;
component activities, especially with regard to community participation and the effective&#13;
utilization of low-cost technologies.&#13;
Micro Credit (PASI)&#13;
12.   To assist PASI, FHIS' micro credit arm, during its transition to an autonomous,&#13;
commercially-operated unit, technical assistance would focus on: (a) workshops to strengthen the&#13;
micro-enterprise sector (including workshops aimed at assisting women entrepreneurs); and (b)&#13;
development and distribution of learning materials for intermediary organizations and micro-&#13;
enterprises (including materials aimed at assisting women entrepreneurs).&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL SECTOR DATA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT&#13;
Social Data Mampine&#13;
1.   In order to improve the capacity of the Government and FHIS to assess the&#13;
priority of investments at and below the municipal level, a social data mapping system will&#13;
be elaborated and ready for use by early-1996. This computerized system should show&#13;
population figures by aldea (there are on average 25 aldeas in each municipality) and the&#13;
corresponding location of schools, health posts, water and sewerage systems, and should&#13;
be updated every six months to track progress in extending the country's social&#13;
infrastructure. This will allow FHIS promoters to better determine investment priorities&#13;
by sector and within each municipality, and to monitor progress in meeting sectoral and&#13;
regional service deficiencies. This system would be expected to work in tandem with new&#13;
community participation methods to ensure that FMILS promoters and community leaders&#13;
are able to identify and agree upon municipal investment priorities. It would also allow&#13;
FHIS to promote a more equitable distribution of social services within each municipality,&#13;
particularly between the municipal capital and the aldeas, and to refine the poverty&#13;
targeting formula according to actual deficiency rates, as discussed in Annex 2.&#13;
2.    Data Sources: Reasonably current (1993) information on the location of schools,&#13;
health posts and water supply are available from the line ministries. However, the most&#13;
recent population data available is for 1988, from the national census. In general,&#13;
reasonably accurate estimates can be derived directly from the 1988 data and the rate of&#13;
national population growth (estimated from the 1974 and 1988 censuses). However, in&#13;
14 municipalities, migration trends have changed population growth rates significantly&#13;
since 1988. In these municipalities, the simple estimation method outlined above will be&#13;
insufficient, and should be augmented by more recent data (for example, on school&#13;
matriculation and vaccination rates, which are available from the Education and Health&#13;
ministries).&#13;
3.    Implementation: Since it is the mandate of SECPLAN to determine national&#13;
investment plans and to provide the line ministries with the information necessary for their&#13;
execution, SECPLAN will manage this project component in close consultation with&#13;
FILS. SECPLAN has also just begun a project to map the existing social infrastructure in&#13;
the municipal capitals. Its staff has substantial experience with mapping, data gathering,&#13;
&#13;

and computer systems, but will require technical assistance in carrying out specific tasks,&#13;
including:&#13;
(a)   Identification of the information needed in the system: what characteristics&#13;
of each school, health center, and water system should the system provide?&#13;
How should the population data be presented (sex, age, etc.);&#13;
(b)   Design and implementation of a system to guarantee regular updating of&#13;
the mapping system with data from FHIS and the lines ministries;&#13;
(c)   Determination of an appropriate methodology with which to estimate&#13;
current population data in high-growth areas; and&#13;
(d)   Development of a user's training program.&#13;

Analysis of CoveraLe by FIS&#13;
5.    To obtain a baseline for the analysis of the efficiency and impact of FHIS, it is&#13;
necessary to obtain detailed information on infrastructure coverage by sector and region.&#13;
This should be closely coordinated between SECPLAN and FH1S to ensure that the data&#13;
collected fit within the data system currently being established for social data mapping. It&#13;
will require the assistance listed below.&#13;

Household Survey Data Analysis&#13;
7.    The above targeting tool needs to be complemented with analyses of national level&#13;
household survey data, which identify areas of current investment priorities in the nation&#13;
as a whole, and which monitor changes over time in social sector indicators such as&#13;
malnutrition, consumption, infant mortality, illiteracy, and educational attainment. While a&#13;
national household survey does not determine the actual impact of a given program (such&#13;
as FLIS investments, it does monitor national and regional advances (or setbacks) in&#13;
social progress. The usefulness of household survey data therefore lies in being able to&#13;
monitor social sector improvements over time and point out areas of continued weakness,&#13;
thus providing a general orientation for social investment programs in Honduras.&#13;
8.    Data Sources: Several sources of household survey data are currently available:&#13;
the Encuesta de Prop6sitos Multiples (EPM), a semi-annual national survey focusing on&#13;
employment indicators and rotative modules on other living standards indicators,&#13;
conducted by the Direcci6n General de Estadisticay Censo (DGEC); the Encuesta&#13;
Nacional de Epidemiologiay Salud Familiar (ENESF), which includes coverage of water&#13;
supply and sanitation, and is scheduled to be conducted in mid-1995 and repeated in 1999;&#13;
and, the Encuesta Sobre Indicadores Socto-Econ6micos conducted in 1994 (and&#13;
scheduled to be repeated at least once, in 1997), which provides a more detailed&#13;
assessment of living standards indicators, and was conducted by a private consulting firm.&#13;
All three surveys are financed by USAID.&#13;
9.    Given the existence of these data sources and plans to update them, only a small&#13;
amount of resources will be invested in analyzing the results of existing data sources,&#13;
particularly the recently released results of the Encuesta Sobre Indicadores Socio-&#13;
Econ6micos. This survey represents what may be a significant improvement over the&#13;
EPM, which suffers from the limited nature of its questionnaire, changes in sampling&#13;
methodology which have made comparisons over time difficult, and the slow and&#13;
incomplete dissemination of results.&#13;
10.   Implementation: SECPLAN will coordinate these analyses and present them for&#13;
discussion at two workshops planned for mid-1995. These workshops would build upon&#13;
the research currently being conducted by USAID on basic poverty and nutrition&#13;
indicators from the Encuesta Sobre Indicadores Socio-Econ6micos, which will be&#13;
presented at a seminar in April 1995. The analyses would be designed: (a) to provide a&#13;
baseline of social indicators for 1993/94 to guide sectoral investment priorities for FIS&#13;
(and line ministries) for the next 3-4 years; (b) to foster broader capacity within&#13;
government agencies to use survey data to identify current social conditions; and (c) to&#13;
evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in existing survey work, in order to determine&#13;
future improvements which may be necessary. Analyses would be solicited from qualified&#13;
researchers in line ministries, universities, and international organizations, and would focus&#13;
on:&#13;

74                               ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
(a)   access to social services by income level (education, health, water supply&#13;
and sanitation) and migration; and&#13;
(b)   employment, unemployment, underemployment, female employment, and&#13;
income level.&#13;
In addition, UNICEF is interested in preparing an analysis of child employment,&#13;
and in participating in the seminar. They would finance this study.&#13;
11.   The results would be presented and discussed at the two workshops, where the&#13;
implications for social policy and the strengths and weaknesses of the existing survey data&#13;
would be discussed and documented. The general findings of each analysis and the&#13;
conclusions reached during the workshops would be summarized clearly and concisely and&#13;
be published in a document for wide dissemination throughout the Government, To help&#13;
achieve this, four weeks of technical assistance are required for the following tasks: (i)&#13;
coordinating analysis plans with on-going work at USAID; (ii) providing statistical&#13;
support to analysts as needed; (iii) directing the seminars; and (iv) producing the summary&#13;
document.&#13;

Technical Assistance: Social Data Mauming and Survey Analysis Components&#13;
13.   A total of 10 weeks of international technical assistance and two years of local&#13;
technical assistance is needed by SECPLAN in support of the social data mapping&#13;
component and the survey data analysis. To ensure appropriate coordination between&#13;
FIHS and SECPLAN, the latter's role as coordinator would be agreed upon formally by&#13;
"convenio" with FHIS, with responsibilities and expected products clearly delineated.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT&#13;
1.    The objective of this component is to further the efforts supported by the Environmental&#13;
Development Project (EDP) in developing the environmental management capacity of&#13;
municipalities and communities. The EDP pilot efforts will, inter alia, strengthen the capacity of&#13;
20 municipalities, in four different regions of the country, to manage their natural resources and to&#13;
address their environmental problems. Subject to its outcome, this would be complemented under&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
2.    The National Program of Environmental Technical Assistance to Municipalities&#13;
(PROATAM) is an environmental awareness and training program addressed to municipal&#13;
authorities and employees and community leaders of all 271 municipalities not covered under the&#13;
EDP (Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula are excluded). Its objective is to provide them with&#13;
sufficient information to enable them to undertake specific environmental protection and&#13;
management activities by: (a) developing technical manuals, teaching methods, and supporting&#13;
materials; and (b) implementing workshops for about 1,400 participants (4 to 9 per municipality),&#13;
half of whom would be municipal corporation members or employees and the other half&#13;
community leaders. The project would limit its activities to those municipalities not covered&#13;
under the EDP, and would support: (a) one local technical staff within SEDA to promote and&#13;
monitor program design and implementation for about 36 staff months; (b) development of&#13;
curricula, methodologies, technical and teaching materials, specific to the needs of the different&#13;
types of municipalities; (c) reproduction of technical and teaching materials (26,000 manuals,&#13;
16,000 pamphlets, 200 videos, and 300 flipcharts); (d) about 150 workshops, of 2 to 3 days&#13;
duration; (e) fees and per-diem of instructors to prepare and teach workshops (about 1,600&#13;
instructor days); (f) about 4,600 surface round-trips for participants; (g) participant lodging and&#13;
meals (about 10,600 participant days); (h) an implementation contract with an NGO or private&#13;
firm; and (i) international consultant services (about 3 staff months) to advise SEDA on the&#13;
detailed contents of terms of reference (TORs), the technical merit of proposals, and the quality of&#13;
intermediate products developed in the design phase of the program. The participants in each&#13;
seminar would come from municipalities with similar environmental problems and levels of&#13;
organization. The workshops would cover the most important local environmental issues in the&#13;
different regions of Honduras, and would promote local environmental commnittees and demand&#13;
for resources available in the project and elsewhere to finance small environmental projects.&#13;
3.    SEDA is responsible for the component in close consultation with FHIS. The component&#13;
is expected to be implemented over a three-year period: one year for the design phase and two&#13;
years for workshop execution. The workshops would require 3 to 4 instructors working full time.&#13;
TORs and a time-bound action plan for the execution of the component have been prepared by&#13;
SEDA, in consultation with FHIS. As condition of disbursement against this component. SEDA&#13;
would provide evidence to IDA that satisfactory progress in the implementation of the pilot&#13;
municipal environmental management subcomponent of the EDP had been achieved in at least&#13;
two of the four selected regions through, inter alia, completed municipal diagnostics, draft&#13;

RECURRENT COST IMPLICATIONS'&#13;
Education&#13;
As detailed in Annex 1, it is estimated that, for the next four years, 2,868&#13;
classrooms will require construction and reconstruction and 1 1,800 classrooms will&#13;
require rehabilitation and repair. Moreover, 2,566 bathrooms and 6,294 latrines in&#13;
existing schools need repair or rehabilitation. The necessary investment per year is&#13;
estimated as follows:2 3&#13;

If these investments are realized and to be sustained, the additional operations and&#13;
maintenance costs amount to US$3.0 million as of the last year of the project. Also, an&#13;
amount of approximately US$4.5 million annually would be required to cover the salaries&#13;
of teachers of new schools/classrooms. The incremental recurrent costs are projected as&#13;
follows:&#13;
The recurrent costs in this section reflect the maximum costs if FlIS were to meet all current needs.&#13;
However, this goes well beyond F.IS' capacity.&#13;
2 The total number of new classrooms excludes the 290 classrooms which will be constructed under the&#13;
Basic Education Project assisted by IDA.&#13;
3 Includes only investments in Basic Education for which detailed information is available (see Annex 1).&#13;
The recent Ministry of Education's decision to also invest in secondary education means that&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of some secondary school classrooms will replace programmed&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of primary school classrooms. The financial resource requirements to&#13;
cover recurrent costs would remain the same.&#13;

Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Due to the nature of the water supply and sanitation projects which FHIS finances,&#13;
it is expected that the operations and maintenance costs of the water systems, the drainage&#13;
systems, and latrines would be covered entirely by the beneficiaries.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
1.    Because of the change in FIHIS' objective from emergency response to poverty&#13;
reduction, there is an urgent need to establish a monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
allowing the Government, FHIS, and the donors to assess: (i) regularly, the project's&#13;
organizational, financial, and physical progress; and (ii) from time to time, the project's&#13;
impact on meeting critical social sector needs, as described in Annex 1. The system&#13;
should provide all data needed by FILS' management for its decision process, by the&#13;
external auditors for their quarterly and yearly audits, and by FHIS' management and the&#13;
donors for supervision, Annual Project Reviews, the Mid-Term Review, and the Project&#13;
Implementation Completion (see Annex 18).&#13;
2.    To assist in establishing a simple, realistic, and useful system, technical assistance&#13;
would be provided in the context of the study on strengthening the management of the&#13;
subproject cycle (see Annex 10). However, FHIS' management needs access to project&#13;
performance data as of the start of the project, and a set of key project performance&#13;
monitoring indicators was discussed during negotiations; agreement was also reached on&#13;
their inclusion in semi-annual progress reports. (See Appendix).&#13;
3.    The eventual full set of performance and impact indicators should cover: (a) the&#13;
efficiency and quality of FillS' subprojects; (b) the administration and financial efficiency&#13;
of FHIS; (c) the focus of FHIS' investments; and (d) the impact of FHIS' subprojects.&#13;
4.    The Efficiency and Quality of Subprojects. A comparison of results ex-ante&#13;
and ex-post of completed subprojects needs to cover: (a) the established and projected&#13;
physical capacity; (b) the total actual and projected costs of the subprojects and the&#13;
counterpart amounts from the community; (c) the person-months of direct employment&#13;
generated and projected; (d) the number of projects implemented which show unit costs&#13;
which fall outside the established acceptable range; (e) the number of projects which&#13;
comply with the norms established by the principal sector agency and with the technical&#13;
specifications of the designs of the subprojects; (f) the percentage of cases with&#13;
satisfactory quality of workmanship; (g) the percentage of cases with satisfactory quality&#13;
of materials; (h) the percentage of subproject which have a satisfactory location; (i) the&#13;
percentage of cases which comply with environmental protection measures; and (j) the&#13;
number of projects which comply with the established criteria in the operational manual&#13;
for promoting, evaluating, contracting and supervising.&#13;
5.    The Efficiency of FHIS' Administration and Finance. General performance&#13;
indicators for FHLS and its operational units need to cover: (i) the number of subprojects&#13;
and the amounts processed by each unit (promotion, evaluation, approval, contracting,&#13;
implementation, closing and submission of the subprojects) and the comparison with the&#13;
objectives established in the Annual Operational Program; (ii) average period of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
processing in each of the operational units, compared with the established period; (iii) the&#13;
number of technical and administrative personnel in each unit, compared with the target;&#13;
(iv) administrative cost, compared with the established target; (v) disbursements of the&#13;
subproject components; (vi) disbursement of the institutional strengthening component;&#13;
(vii) revenues and expenditures by sources of funds; (viii) development of the inter-&#13;
institutional coordination with established principals of each sector; and (ix) compliance&#13;
with the contractual norms established in the agreement.&#13;
6.    The Use of FHIS Resources. This will include the review of: (a) the total&#13;
amounts channeled to the municipalities, classified by levels of poverty (very poor, poor,&#13;
deficient, regular, and acceptable), and compared with the targets; (b) the number of&#13;
subprojects and the amounts channeled to the sectors, classified by sector and compared&#13;
with ehe targets; and (c) the municipal per capita investment classified according to one&#13;
of the poverty levels and compared with the initially assigned per capita level.&#13;
7.    The Impact of the Subprojects. The impact of the subprojects will be&#13;
determined based on the evaluation of a sample of completed subprojects and during the&#13;
implementation phases. This evaluation will be realized for the Mid-Term Review report&#13;
and for the Project Implementation Report (PIR). FHIS will have the basic responsibility&#13;
for preparing the information for this analysis. The information for these reports will be&#13;
gathered through field visits and direct interviews with the beneficiaries. The analysis will&#13;
concentrate on (i) the characteristics of the beneficiaries to determine how FHIS&#13;
distributes investments for the poor and complies with the established selected criteria;&#13;
(ii) the effective utilization of the subprojects and the start-up of the social services for&#13;
those which were originally approved; (iii) the maintenance and operation of the projects&#13;
to-date and the perspectives for their future sustainability; and (iv) the priority of the&#13;
subprojects, according to the direct beneficiaries.&#13;

HONDURAS THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN AND MID-TERM REVIEW&#13;
I.    Although the proposed project is the third operation of its kind, experience under&#13;
the first two projects confirms the justification of close supervision. In addition, with the&#13;
objective of the FHIS changed from emergency fund to fund for poverty reduction, there&#13;
is now a need to review not only the physical results of the subprojects, but also the extent&#13;
to which they (i) respond to demand expressed by the communities, and (ii) fit within the&#13;
Government's social sector priorities. Consequently, the project will require about 17&#13;
staff-weeks of supervision each year. In addition, 3 staff-weeks are budgeted in 1995 for&#13;
the first Annual Project Review, 12 staff-weeks in 1997 to support the Mid-Term Review,&#13;
and 6 staff-weeks in 1999 to support the Project Implementation Completion.&#13;
2.    The proposed composition and staffing level of the supervision program for each&#13;
year of the project is presented in the appendix. The supervision teams will vary in&#13;
composition, and include, apart from the Task Manager, as needed, other IDA staff and&#13;
consultants with expertise in the areas of engineering, water supply and sanitation,&#13;
statistics, community participation, environment, MIS, procurement, disbursement, and&#13;
auditing. Supervision missions will normally be conducted twice a year, in May and&#13;
November, beginning in November 1995. The November supervision missions will&#13;
coincide with the Annual Project Reviews. A Mid-Term Review mission has been&#13;
scheduled for when 50 percent of the credit has been committed, or two years after credit&#13;
effectiveness, whichever comes first; this is tentatively budgeted to coincide with the&#13;
November 1997 supervision mission, but may be advanced. All missions will involve&#13;
discussions with project officials in FHIS, as well as field visits, on the basis of which the&#13;
missions will evaluate:&#13;
(a)   credit commitments and disbursements by project component;&#13;
(b)   technical quality of subprojects;&#13;
(c)   implementation progress of the agreed annual work program;&#13;
(d)   project benefits in education, health, and water supply and sanitation,&#13;
measured on the basis of agreed monitoring indicators;&#13;
(e)   relationship with social line ministries and municipalities;&#13;
(f)   organization and management of FHIS; and&#13;
(g)   compliance with project administrative procedures, including procurement,&#13;
disbursement, accounting, and semi-annual reporting requirements.&#13;
3.    The missions will be helped by the data and information provided by FHIS in the&#13;
semi-annual progress reports by no later than March 31 and September 30 of each year, as&#13;
well as by the quarterly audit reports of both ongoing and completed projects prepared by&#13;
the independent external auditor.&#13;
Annual Reviews&#13;
4.    Beginning in 1995, Annual Reviews will be held by November 30 of each year by&#13;
FHIS, MOF, SECPLAN, MOE, MOH, and IDA, IDB, and KfW to cover, inter alia: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                               ANNEX 18&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
progress in implementing the project and attaining its objectives, according to the agreed&#13;
set of key project performance monitoring indicators (see Annex 17); (b) the agreed work&#13;
program for the past year and the proposed work program for the next year; (c) the&#13;
proposed investment and administrative budget for the next year; (d) the provision of&#13;
teachers for completed education facilities by MOE and the funding of maintenance by&#13;
MOE, MOH, the municipalities, and/or the final beneficiaries; (e) progress in community&#13;
participation in general and by women and indigenous people in particular; and (f)&#13;
modifications in project design, if needed, to adjust to changing circumstances.&#13;
5.    Each year, FHIS will provide IDA, IDB, and KfW, by no later than October 31 (a)&#13;
for their approval, a proposed annual work program for the subsequent year, including&#13;
activities to be implemented in each subcomponent and their respective costs and funding&#13;
and (b) annual reports on project progress (supplementing the semi-annual report&#13;
mentioned in para. 3). If, as a result of the review of these documents and the subsequent&#13;
discussions, it is decided that corrective action by Government or FHIS is required, the&#13;
Government or FHIS, as the case may be, will promptly carry out such action.&#13;
Mid-Term Review&#13;
6.    The Mid-Term Review will be held after about two years. It will have the same&#13;
participants as the Annual Review meetings. The main objectives of the Mid-Term&#13;
Review are to evaluate project performance during implementation, to provide project&#13;
management with immediate feed-back on project achievements as well as on areas&#13;
needing improvement, to justify and decide upon eventual changes in project scope and&#13;
design, and to document the status of project execution thoroughly for the benefit of the&#13;
Borrower and the donors. The Mid-Term Review consists of an initial period of&#13;
approximately two weeks, when FHIS collects data and reviews information, assembled&#13;
since the beginning of project implementation on technical, administrative, and financial&#13;
aspects of the project. Following the arrival of the donor representatives, there will be&#13;
joint field visits, a joint report, and discussions with all relevant government parties,&#13;
focusing on (i) the targeting of FHIS funds (in order to channel more resources to poorer&#13;
municipalities; (ii) the prioritization of sector investments; (iii) the quality of the ongoing&#13;
and completed subprojects financed by FHIS, (iv) the impact of FHIS-financed&#13;
subprojects; (v) the administrative efficiency and the financial soundness of the operations&#13;
of FHIS; (vi) an assessment of the extent to which the experience of the FHIS can&#13;
strengthen municipalities, and improve their operations; (vii) an assessment of the&#13;
relationship of FHIS with the line ministries (particularly with regard to the prioritization&#13;
of investments and the maintenance of completed subprojects); and (viii) the prospects for&#13;
the future of FHIS. Following the Mid-Term Review meeting, the Government and FHIS&#13;
will ensure expeditious implementation of the agreed corrective action.&#13;

            Project (FHIS Second Stage)

        <abstracts>
            The Third Social Investment Fund Project
            (Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS) Second Stage) will
            continue to assist the Government in strengthening its
            poverty allevation efforts and in maintaining social
            cohesion, while the Government attempts to regain fiscal
            balance and the line ministries strengthen their
            institutional capacities. It will also support the
            Government's decentralization strategy, development to
            the local contracting industry, the sustainability of
            subprojects, and the targeting of scarce resources in poorer
            areas. To achieve this, it will focus on meeting priority
            social and economic departments, municipalities,
            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and communities,
            within the parameters of municipal allocations decided on
            the basis of a poverty targeting formula. The project will
            support FHIS's investment program for a four-year
            period, as well as efforts to establish a better social data
            base and to assist municipalities on environmental matters.
            It will provide for (a) a range of small-scale, social and
            economic infrastructure subprojects; (b) a priority basic
            needs program; (c) a comprehensive program of technical
            assistance to help FHIS overcome some institutional
            weakness; (d) the establishment of a social data mapping
            system and strengthening of the design and implementation of
            national household surveys as the major tools to target the
            poor and to monitor progress of social development programs;
            and (e) subject to trails carried out by FHIS under the
            Environmental Development Project, a small program of
            technical assistance to municipalities in assessing
            environmental issues and in preparing programs for
            corrective action.
