Recent Economic Developments&#13;
R  enewed concerns over the global growth outlook and of the European debt crisis, might negatively affect&#13;
   Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s prospects in 2012/2013, and lead to a lower growth turn-out compared to 2011. First quarter&#13;
growth in 2012 remained overall robust, but showed considerable weakness in the industry sector. This was in&#13;
contrast to what was observed in the second half of 2011, when industrial growth led by buoyant construction,&#13;
and mining activities pushed the sector to the top, ahead of services. In the second half of 2011, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
growth momentum accelerated largely led by thriving non-tradable goods and services sectors while the&#13;
manufacturing sector continued to be sluggish. The Rwandan economy expanded by 10.8 percent during&#13;
the second half of 2011, but manufacturing only contributed 0.5 percentage points to this growth outcome.&#13;
Agricultural output took a leap in the second half, mainly due to a very good second harvest season outcome.&#13;
Overall, growth turn-out for 2011 stood at 8.6 percent, up from 7.2 percent in 2010. Inflationary pressures&#13;
reappeared in tandem with high international food and fuel prices. The small policy response came with a&#13;
delay, not enough to prevent core inflation reaching its highest level since mid-2009. Core inflation exceeded&#13;
headline inflation for the whole second half of 2011. The current account deficit broadened in 2011. Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
export performed robustly, benefiting from high international prices, but could not keep up with the increasing&#13;
import bill, leading to a further deterioration in the trade balance. For 2012, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is expected&#13;
to continue to grow slower than it did in 2011, but at a healthy pace. The industrial sector is likely to expand&#13;
less than in 2011 and growth in the services sector is expected to be more moderate, both on account of a&#13;
more risky global environment.&#13;

  percent in value) in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
  The public sector continues to drive the high growth in construction. This is reflected by the increased share of capital&#13;
  expenditures which average more than 40 percent of total public expenditures since 2008. More than half are funded&#13;
  by aid flows, with these resources mostly used for schools, roads and hospital construction, and irrigation works. The&#13;
  contribution of the private sector remains small in comparison to construction activities undertaken by the public sector.&#13;
  The amount of new private loans for construction came to Rwf86.1 billion in 2011 compared with public capital expenditure&#13;
  estimated at Rwf447.9 billion in the same period.&#13;
&#13;
  The majority of the large public construction and consultancy contracts, particularly for roads and office premises,&#13;
  are being executed exclusively by a few international contractors. Only a small number of local contractors are able&#13;
  to compete or work through joint ventures with these international contractors. However, the role of the private sector&#13;
  is slowly increasing. Recently, private real estate developers started to develop housing estates on a commercial basis.&#13;
  Additionally, associations of private investors started to develop commercial and industrial areas, using private funds,&#13;
  encouraged by a program of the Private Sector Federation developed in 2008. The Kigali City Market, a modern shopping&#13;
  complex, is one of the products of these formal business investment groups.4&#13;
&#13;
  For private domestic construction businesses, a number of factors constrain their expansion. Most domestic firms are&#13;
  small with a limited capital base, which affects their ability to post collateral for purchasing raw materials and equipment.&#13;
  There is a shortage of trained personnel on the local market, which pushes businesses to hire workers from neighboring&#13;
  countries. Another constraint is the high cost of construction raw materials, which are largely imported, with local producers&#13;
  unable to satisfy the demand. A large number of small and medium enterprises associated with the construction industry&#13;
  disappear, shortly after they are established. Apart from larger construction projects, the segment that supports private&#13;
  housing construction, which could provide opportunities for smaller enterprises, remains unregulated, and owners often&#13;
  build without technical expertise or recourse to local contractors.&#13;
&#13;
  The outlook of the sector is mixed and depends on continued high levels of public capital expenditures. Larger construction&#13;
  firms with access to public contracts report an optimistic outlook. The size of Government capital expenditure is planned&#13;
  to increase in the 2012/2013 budget, and will likely continue to fuel construction growth in this market segment. The&#13;
  approval of construction permits continues to be high, and similar to the previous year. As of April 2012, the construction&#13;
  permit licensing for Kigali5 approved almost 40 percent of the number of construction permits cleared in 2011. However,&#13;
  smaller private operators expect to work at reduced capacity compared to 2011, based on the limited contracts in their&#13;
  books for 2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Improving corporate governance combined with                                         percent in 2009 to 8.0 percent in December 2011 (but&#13;
deployment of better credit appraisal in some banks,                                 still above the maximum target of 7 percent).&#13;
contributed to the decrease in Non-performing&#13;
Loans (NPLs) from the high levels observed in 2009.                                  Financial services also continued to benefit from&#13;
The NPLs/Gross loans ratio (NPL ratio) fell from 13.1                                increased insurance activities, especially in the life&#13;

  mandate expanded to being part of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s development and the Kigali Investment Company was formed.&#13;
5 The One Stop Center was introduced in April 2010 by the City of Kigali, in effort to provide quick and better services to its clients, especially in the construction&#13;
  industry. The center deals with: (i) buildings with a capacity of receiving at least 100 people per day, (ii) projects covering an area equivalent or more than&#13;
  4,000m2, (iii) constructions with a commercial, recreational usage and major residential developments and (iv) buildings with more than 2 floors.&#13;

 being among the most financially excluded. The financial&#13;

&#13;
 depth improved within the region, but to different degrees&#13;
 in the various countries (Figure 6). The average credit to GDP&#13;
 ratio for the five EAC countries rose from 17.6 percent in&#13;
 2008, to 21.7 percent in 2011. Kenya remains the country&#13;
 with the highest ratio, on average 33.0 percent between&#13;
 2008 and 2011, while Rwanda has the lowest ratio at around&#13;
 12.7 percent over the same period. Large parts of the&#13;
 population in the region remain financially excluded, with&#13;
 less than a third of the population in Rwanda, Tanzanian and&#13;
 Uganda having access to formal financial system, and more&#13;
 than half of the population in Rwanda and Tanzania having&#13;
 no access to financial services at all. Even in countries with a&#13;
 high level of financial inclusion in the region, such as Kenya&#13;
 and Uganda, informal financial services dominate (Figure 7).                            Source: World Development Indicators (WDI).&#13;

8 Over the first nine months of 2011, the Government had to maintain high overdraft levels at Central Bank and also sell a large amount of domestic security&#13;
  instruments in order to cover priority expenditures.&#13;

                                           Box 3: Inflation Trends as a Result of Global Fuel and Food Price Trends&#13;
&#13;
D    omestic fuel prices have been frequently reviewed in 2011 (Figure 9). In the first half of 2011, prices were raised three&#13;
     times by a cumulative 11.3 percent, and 12.1 percent respectively for petrol and gasoline, in response to world oil&#13;
 market developments. In the second half, domestic fuel prices were revised downward, twice by a cumulative 5.7 percent,&#13;
 subsequent to the first cut of fuel excise taxes in July 2011. After the second cut, in January 2012, fuel prices were reduced&#13;
 by 6 percent, but this lasted only for one month. As of May 2012, fuel prices were revised upwards, twice, due to increases&#13;
 in international prices at the beginning of 2012.&#13;
&#13;
 Food prices remained high in the second half of 2011, driven by local food inflation (Figure 10). This is partly due to the&#13;
 high weight of local food prices in the consumption basket. As at the end of 2011, food inflation stood at 11.2 percent,&#13;
 from negative 2.7 percent a year ago. Prices of locally produced foods were 10.4 percent higher than a year ago and prices&#13;
 of imported foods were up 15.9 percent. Overall, prices of cereals (mostly rice) were the major driver of food inflation in&#13;
 2011. During the first three months of 2012, food prices continued to rise, and as of March, they stood at 15.4 percent, but&#13;
 eased off in April at 12.8 percent.&#13;

&#13;
 A   fairly stable nominal exchange rate against the US dollar and rising inflation, led to a real appreciation of the Rwanda&#13;
     Franc in the second half of 2011 (Figure 16). The Rwandan franc (Rwf) remained reasonably stable against the US dollar&#13;
 in the second half of 2011, depreciating by only 0.3 percent. The Rwf continued to appreciate against other EAC currencies,&#13;
 except for the Burundian Franc, early in the second half of 2011, but the trend had reversed over the last two months of&#13;
 2011. The Rwf started depreciating against all EAC currencies as inflationary pressures were easing off in these countries.&#13;
 However, the Rwf appreciated against other currencies of trading partners used in the computation of the real effective&#13;
 exchange rate. By December 2011, the weighted nominal bilateral exchange rate of ten major trading partners had slightly&#13;
 appreciated by 2.2 percent. Overall this resulted in an appreciated Rwf in real terms in the second half of 2011.In 2012, the&#13;
 Rwf continued to be stable against the US dollar and it depreciated slightly by 1.5 percent as of mid-July, 2012. Compared&#13;
 to other EAC currencies, the Rwf depreciated, except for the Burundian Franc.&#13;

       in 2011 by 24.9 percent to US$251.8 million, mainly on account of large (18.1 percent) growth in the leisure segment. In&#13;
    2011, the second export earner was other services, with almost 20 percent of total export value, as a result of the license&#13;
    fee of a new mobile operator, Bharti airtel.&#13;
&#13;
    The introduction of a single tourism visa within the EAC region could provide Rwanda with a significant increase in&#13;
    leisure tourism. Between 2008 and 2011, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s share of EAC region tourism receipts was 7.0 percent, while hosting&#13;
    18.0 percent of tourism arrivals in the EAC region (Figure 26). Tanzania accounts for the lion share of EAC tourism receipts,&#13;
    43.3 percent, followed by Kenya and Uganda. Most tourist arrivals in Rwanda originate from the EAC region (38.8 percent)&#13;
    and the DRC (42.7 percent) and come primarily for the purpose of business or visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (Figure&#13;
    27). Only 4.5 percent of arrivals from the EAC region and the DRC come for leisure. At the same time, leisure tourists&#13;
    generated more than 45 percent of tourism receipts in Rwanda.&#13;

                    Box 6: Key Assumptions for the World Bank Growth Forecast for Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
T  he World Bank Rwanda country forecast is based on a sectoral bottom-up approach of projecting growth for 2012&#13;
   and 2013. This approach differs from the approach used for the joint macro-framework the Government, International&#13;
Monetary Fund and the Bank discuss and agree on periodically. Information in Annex 4 provides a brief description of the&#13;
forecasting approach.&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture growth is expected to be positive and follow in 2012 and 2013 the trends of previous years. Agriculture&#13;
is rain fed and Rwanda has experienced delayed but abnormal heavy rains and floods between January and May 2012&#13;
which will likely impact crop output adversely at the end of season B. However, substantial past and ongoing public&#13;
investments in the sector, including in irrigation improvements and productivity increases, are expected to continue to&#13;
positively impact the growth path. High Government expenditures in the sector are expected to be sustained through&#13;
continued donor financing of several successful sector projects. Based on these assumptions, an overall positive, but&#13;
lower than 2011 sector outcome, is projected which would also help ease pressure on domestic food prices. For export&#13;
crops, it is forecasted that growth will be slowing down, mainly reflecting on the natural two-year coffee cycle and also the&#13;
likelihood that global commodity prices will retreat from their current record levels, as the global economic environment&#13;
cools down.&#13;
&#13;
Industrial growth is forecasted to remain relatively strong in 2012 and 2013, but with a slightly more cautious outlook.&#13;
A projected slight slowdown is based on the assumption of retreating mineral prices as global economic activities cool off.&#13;
It is expected that construction activities for 2012 will remain substantial due to still large ongoing public infrastructure&#13;
investments, but declining slightly in 2013. Manufacturing is projected to slow down in 2012 due to the impact of high&#13;
energy and input prices, before starting to benefit from improved global conditions in 2013 and internal infrastructure&#13;
improvements. As an influencing factor of industrial activity, it is also expected that credit growth will decelerate in 2012&#13;
and 2013, which started in the last quarter of 2011, as further tightening of monetary policy is expected to rein in inflation.&#13;
&#13;
Growth in the services sector is projected to slightly slow down to more moderate levels in 2012 and 2013. Growth is&#13;
expected to slightly slow down as public expenditure-led services, which positively impacted economic growth in previous&#13;
years, are expected to grow at a lower pace. Transport services are likely to be adversely impacted if global fuel prices&#13;
continue to remain high or increase again. Trade and wholesale services are expected to continue to grow at similar levels&#13;
as observed in the second half of 2011, when higher income from a good agriculture outturn positively affected growth in&#13;
this sub-sector. This assumption is based on the implementation of plans for an overall increase in wages and salaries for&#13;
public servants, (adopted in January 2012) that is likely to impact 2012 and 2013 the most. Previous high growth in the&#13;
financial sector is expected to slightly slow down, as the sector expanded substantially in recent years and might head for&#13;
consolidation.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
PART TWO&#13;
MAKING THE MOST OF REGIONAL&#13;
INTEGRATION FOR RWANDA&#13;
R   egional integration can bring about substantive benefits to EAC countries. But will progress on the regional&#13;
    integration front affect all countries in a similar fashion? For example, will integration create the same&#13;
opportunities and challenges for member countries? It seems like the answer to these questions is no, taking&#13;
into account the differences among the EAC countries. Three countries are landlocked (Burundi, Rwanda, and&#13;
Uganda), and two are coastal (Kenya and Tanzania), which in turn impacts the cost of accessing international&#13;
markets. Size-wise, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) is similar to Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s, but is five times that of&#13;
Rwanda, and almost twenty times that of Burundi. Tanzania has a population density of around 50 people&#13;
per sq. km, while Burundiâ&#128;&#153;s and Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s are 325 and 430 respectively. Some countries have important oil&#13;
(Uganda), and gas reserves (Tanzania), while others are mainly importers (Rwanda). Given these scenarios, it&#13;
is obvious that the challenges and opportunities created by the regional integration process are diverse for&#13;
the member countries. Asymmetric benefits will imply that the complementary agenda that countries should&#13;
follow to maximize the impact of those opportunities, and minimize the challenges of the integration process,&#13;
should also be different. This part of the Rwanda Economic Update looks into these issues, and gives a focus&#13;
on how Rwanda can lean on the EAC in order to unlock the benefits of increased regional integration, and&#13;
perhaps, globalization. It draws on the two World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s reports of Reshaping Economic Geography of East&#13;
Africa: from Regional to Global Integration (2012) and Defragmenting Africa (2012).&#13;

 The Treaty for establishment of the EAC was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on 7 July 2000 following&#13;
 its ratification by the original three partner states â&#128;&#147; Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Rwanda and Burundi acceded to&#13;
 the EAC Treaty on 18 June 2007, and became full members of the EAC from 1 July 2007. The EAC today is a regional&#13;
 intergovernmental organization of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi with headquarters, and a Secretariat, in&#13;
 Arusha, Tanzania. South Sudan has made an application to join the EAC which is ongoing.&#13;
&#13;
 The collapse of the EAC in 1977 can be attributed to a number of reasons; including governance challenges, economic&#13;
 imbalances (in part arising from the socialist system in Tanzania and capitalist system in Kenya), political disagreements&#13;
 and an extremely limited dissemination of information. Two reasons stand out, first, the relatively low engagement&#13;
 of stakeholders in civil society, the private sector and amongst EAC citizens in the decision-making and management&#13;
 processes of community integration. And, second, a lack of a dispute resolution process for sharing the costs and benefits&#13;
 arising out of EAC integration. Since 1977, steps have been taken to address some of these problems, including a Mediation&#13;
 Agreement (1984) for determining and diving EAC assets and liabilities, and the agreement for the establishment of the&#13;
 Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Cooperation (1993). Nonetheless, a number of the above problems&#13;
 remain, and citizen engagement, knowledge sharing, consensus building and economic integration are and will continue&#13;
 to be key components for the success of the EAC today.&#13;
&#13;
 The EAC, the smallest economic community in Africa, has already made progress. Out of the four planned stages of EAC&#13;
 integration â&#128;&#147; customs union, common market, monetary union and political federationâ&#128;&#148;the EAC has successfully reduced&#13;
 tariffs on intraregional trade, enlarged to five members and established the customs union with a common external tariff.&#13;
 The common market commenced in July 2010 and will ultimately allow all factors of production to move freely within the&#13;
 region. All five partner states have made commitments to open up and create regional markets in several services sectors&#13;
 and have accepted to remove restrictions on the free movement of workers and on the right of establishment, and to&#13;
 pursue mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications. An ambitious objective has been set of agreeing&#13;
 a protocol on monetary union in 2012 and a common currency in 2015.&#13;

                                   Box 8: The Three Dimensions of Spatial Transformation&#13;
 Division is the most important dimension internationally. Given the relatively small size of internal markets in many&#13;
 African countries (such as Rwanda), economic integration is critical for achieving economies of scale and generating the&#13;
 agglomeration effects that the continentâ&#128;&#153;s firms need to leverage global demand. Economic production is concentrated&#13;
 in a few world regionsâ&#128;&#148;North America, Northeast Asia, and Western Europeâ&#128;&#148;that are also the most integrated. Other&#13;
 regions, by contrast, are divided. Divisions associated with the impermeability of borders and differences in institutions,&#13;
 regulations, and currencies are major constraints to economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
 Distance matters internationally the most for access to world markets. Distance between areas where economic activity is&#13;
 concentrated and areas that lag is important too. The policy challenge is helping firms and workers reduce their distance&#13;
 from density. The main mechanisms are the mobility of labor and the reduction of transport costs through infrastructure&#13;
 investments. A large and dynamic economy in the neighborhood can help smaller countries, especially in regions distant&#13;
 from major world markets, by reducing their distance to markets.&#13;
&#13;
 Density of economic activity has been increasing worldwide not only at local and national, but also at international&#13;
 level. There is no good reason to expect economic growth to spread smoothly across space. The experience of successful&#13;
 developers shows that production becomes more concentrated spatially. Similar concentration of economic mass has&#13;
 occurred internationally. Today, a quarter of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s GDP can fit into an area the size of Cameroon, and half into the size&#13;
 of Algeria. The policy challenge is getting density rightâ&#128;&#148;harnessing market forces to encourage concentration and promote&#13;
 convergence in living standards.&#13;

2.2.1 DIVISION AND THE NEED FOR&#13;
      THINNER BORDERS&#13;
Division refers to market opportunities related&#13;
to size. To the extent that regional integration is&#13;
used to start exploiting economies of scale and&#13;
become more efficient, it can also be used as&#13;
a bridge to access even bigger markets. Today,&#13;
there are few very integrated regions with&#13;
high economic production. But many regions,&#13;
including in Africa, remain divided. For example,&#13;
Figure 34 presents a map where the thickness of&#13;
the borders between countries represents the&#13;
trade restrictions between these two countries,&#13;
and while it is apparent that some of the EAC&#13;
countries have relatively thin borders (e.g.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           Box 10: Northern and Central Transport Corridors of East Africa&#13;
&#13;
 T  here are two main transport corridors in East Africa&#13;
    which link the main land and the two major ports at the&#13;
 Indian Ocean. The Northern Corridor (anchored by the port of&#13;
 Mombasa in Kenya) and the Central Corridor (anchored by the&#13;
 port of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania) are the principal transport&#13;
 routes for national, regional and international trade for the EAC.&#13;
&#13;
 The Northern Corridor is the busiest and most important&#13;
 transport route, providing a link through Kenya to the&#13;
 landlocked economies of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and DRC.&#13;
 An alternative transport network serving the landlocked&#13;
 Great Lakes Region is the Central Corridor through Tanzania.&#13;
 The 1,400 km-long corridor uses lake transport on the Lake&#13;
 Tanganyika to Kigoma in Tanzania, and then road or rail to Dar-&#13;
 Es-Salaam. A third option - through the DRC from the Angola&#13;
 port of Lobito is currently non operational. Another option is&#13;
 the Deep South route, through Zambia, Zimbabwe and South&#13;
 Africa. This corridor uses lake transport on the Lake Tanganyika&#13;
 to Mpulungu in Zambia, and then road transport, or a mix of rail&#13;
 and road transport, to Durban in South Africa. This option is too&#13;
 far from the Great Lakes countries.&#13;
&#13;
 The EAC has corridor authorities, one for the Northern&#13;
 and another for the Central corridor, to address issues on&#13;
 transport regulation and policy harmonization, but they are&#13;
 not fully effective. Transport corridor operations in East Africa&#13;
 are still characterized by long transit times and high costs,&#13;
 making transport cost a high share of the value of exports.&#13;
 Modernization of transport infrastructure and removal of&#13;
 non-tariff barriers along these corridors is critical for trade&#13;
 expansion, economic growth, increased regional integration in&#13;
 East Africa, but also better connectivity between East Africa and&#13;
 the rest of the World.                                               Source: www.eastafricancorridors.org&#13;

In addition, institutional capacity in partner states            in East Africa may well be below this threshold size,&#13;

Costs, though, tend to be incurred immediately.                                 the risk of coordination failures (Box 11). The role&#13;
This mismatch makes it hard for countries to agree                              of supranational institutions is especially important&#13;
on the appropriate allocation of costs, especially for                          when the distribution of the investment burden&#13;

for individual governments to under-invest in such                              benefits. Regional institutions can analyze economic&#13;
an infrastructure. In addition, because cross-border                            and financial feasibility, as well as the distributional&#13;
infrastructure typically extends over several countries,                        consequences of cross-border infrastructure projects,&#13;
it also gives rise to potentially important coordination                        in a non-partisan manner. Thus they could facilitate&#13;
problems. (In fact, â&#128;&#156;missing linksâ&#128;? in major cross-                             regional agreements and compensation schemes.&#13;
border roads are common). Such problems are                                     Regionalizing regulation may therefore help to&#13;
exacerbated if the project has asymmetric country                               enhance policy credibility and commitment, and to&#13;
effects.                                                                        overcome constraints in technical capacity.&#13;

Effective joint-EAC transit management, including for                           Regional special economic zones (SEZ) located&#13;

                                                Box 11: Cross-border Infrastructure Challenges&#13;
&#13;
 L   ack of policy harmonization holds back cross-border&#13;
     infrastructure in promoting intraregional trade. Cross-&#13;
  border infrastructure helps to promote intraregional&#13;
  trade only when supported by harmonized regulatory&#13;
  frameworks and administrative proceduresâ&#128;&#148;still a work in&#13;
  process in East Africa. Regulations on vehicle dimensions,&#13;
  axle-load limits, road transit charges, highway codes have&#13;
  yet to be harmonized. Even common definitions of road&#13;
  classes and route numbers are missing. Similarly, rail&#13;
  connectivity is gummed up with minimal integration of&#13;
  national technical standards, such as those for building&#13;
  and maintaining railway facilities. Shipping on inland&#13;
  waterways and lakes needs a set of common regulations on&#13;
  ship registration as well as safety standards, including those&#13;
  pertaining to periodic ship surveys, staffing requirements,&#13;
  and aids to navigation and radio communication.&#13;
&#13;
  Many border crossings have antiquated infrastructure, inadequate coordination between the countries, and&#13;
  congestion. The key problems that plague border crossings have been extensively documented and include excessive&#13;
  documentary requirements and anachronistic official procedures; insufficient use of information and communications&#13;
  technology systems; questionable due processâ&#128;&#148;lack of transparency, predictability, and consistency in customs activities&#13;
  and determinations; unclear demarcation of responsibilities; and lack of efficient cooperation among a countryâ&#128;&#153;s customs&#13;
  and other governmental agencies.&#13;
&#13;
  There are also frequent unwarranted roadblocks and checkpoints. Inspections are notorious for their lack of procedural&#13;
  transparency. Officials regularly deviate from agreed inspection procedures and subject drivers to administrative&#13;
  harassment and extortion. According to the 2008 EAC Business Climate Index Survey, 172,236 days are lost each year as a&#13;
  result of delays at weighbridges, roadblocks, and customs offices, and US$9.8 million is paid in bribes.18&#13;

The creation of a regional SEZ would&#13;

include cutting down transport costs,&#13;
inter-linkages, providing each other&#13;
with industrial inputs, leveraging and&#13;
sharing technology, infrastructure&#13;
and utilities among others. The key&#13;
benefit for the EAC partner states&#13;
is that coastal SEZ would help them&#13;

19 Charter cities aim to use unoccupied land to establish a new city that operates outside the existing arrangements of the country, establishing their own tax&#13;
   regimes and legal structures. In this concept, countries can act as host, source, or guarantor: the host country provides the land, source countries provide the&#13;
   residents, and guarantor countries ensure that the charter is enforced. Honduras, for example, recently amended its constitution to allow for charter cities.&#13;

&#13;
Methodology: The Consumer Price Index (Headline CPI) and the core consumer price (core CPI) are published by&#13;
the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) and of the Central Bank of Rwanda (BNR) on monthly basis,&#13;
and are usually released every month by the fifteenth. The core CPI is defined as the CPI excluding fresh food and&#13;
energy prices.&#13;
&#13;
The CPI uses a Modified Laspeyres formula to calculate the index. The reference population for the CPI consists of&#13;
all households, urban and rural, living in Rwanda. The index reference, or base, for the CPI is February 2009.&#13;
&#13;
The household basket includes 1,136 products observed in many places spread all over the administrative centers&#13;
of all provinces in Rwanda. All kinds of places of observation are selected: shops, markets, services etc. More than&#13;
29,200 prices are collected every month, by enumerators of the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda and of&#13;
the National Bank of Rwanda. The weights used for the index are the result of the Household Living Conditions&#13;
Survey (EICV II) conducted in 2005-2006 with a sample of 6,900 households.&#13;

&#13;
                                             Annex 2: The Taylor Rule&#13;
&#13;
Being proposed as a monetary policy for the USA by John Taylor, the Taylor rule exhibits how a central bank&#13;
should systematically arrange the interest rate as a policy instrument within its macroeconomic activities and&#13;
during the development of inflation. The rule systematizes the reaction of the monetary policy against prevailing&#13;
trends of inflation and economic conditions, by using the money market short interest rates as a monetary policy&#13;
instrument. The Taylor rule calls for a higher setting of the policy rate when inflation is (or is expected to be) high&#13;
and/or the output is high relative to capacity. Theoretically, the increase/decrease in the policy rate is generally&#13;
thought of as representing a move toward more restrictive/loosening policy stance, one that tends to reduce/&#13;
increase aggregate demand.&#13;
&#13;
Taylor rule proposes a simple model that provides the key instrument to the central banks to focus on.&#13;
&#13;
it = rt* + Ï&#128;t-1 + Î±(Ï&#128;t-Ï&#128;t*) + Î²(yt â&#128;&#147; yt*)&#13;
&#13;
In this equation, while&#13;
&#13;
-   it: is the nominal federal funds rate (the policy rate),&#13;
-   rt*: stands for the real interest rate (2 percent)&#13;
-   Ï&#128;t the inflation rate,&#13;
-   Ï&#128;t* is the targeted inflation rate,&#13;
-   yt the real gross domestic product (real gdp) yt* is the potential GDP growth.&#13;
-   Î± and Î² stands for the responses importance that a central bank gives respectively to inflation and economic&#13;
    conditions while setting the policy rate. Taylor took both as equal (0.5).&#13;
&#13;
The sources of Data used for this exercise are: (i) IMF country report for targeted inflation proxied by the period&#13;
average consumer prices (Selected Economic indicators); (ii) BNR website: monthly inflation and policy rate and&#13;
(iii) National Institute of Statistics for the GDP growth. The GDP trend was estimated based on the actual GDP.&#13;

                                              Annex 3: The 2009 Credit Crunch&#13;
&#13;
Beginning 2005, the banking sector in Rwanda experienced an excess liquidity position, following the recapitalization&#13;
of two banks, which were in financial difficulties, and the reduction of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s financing of the budget,&#13;
through overdraft and commercial bank borrowing (because of higher external funding support since 2004). Banks&#13;
also still limited lending to the private sector, as they preferred lending to the Government, which led to a limited&#13;
absorption of prevailing liquidity. As a result BNR had to intervene massively on the money market, with money&#13;
market and Treasury bill rates decreasing to historic low levels in the first quarter of 2005. In August 2005, BNR&#13;
introduced the reference rate for money market operations, set at 9 percent and replaced it in August 2008 with&#13;
the KRR. In August 2005, growth of credit to the private sector was above 30 percent year-on-year and the core&#13;
inflation was still in single digits. By March 2006, the policy rate had become negative in real terms as core inflation&#13;
was rising, but high growth in credit to the private sector was continuing. In July 2008 growth of bank deposits&#13;
declined sharply after the withdrawal of around Rwf8 billion by large depositors in an attempt to diversify their&#13;
asset portfolio (from savings deposits to more attractive investment outlets such as real estate, government bonds,&#13;
etc.). Prior to this, a large domestic cooperative network graduated to a commercial bank status in early 2008, and&#13;
withdrew about Rwf6 billion as deposits from other commercial banks. Growth in credit to the private sector&#13;
peaked at 37.1 percent year-on-year in November 2008, when the core inflation was at its historic highs, at 22.7&#13;
percent. At the same time BNR kept the KRR constant (Figure 12). As a result of the deposit to credit mismatch,&#13;
deposit rates increased and the market for credit dried up.&#13;

&#13;
                                    Annex 4: Forecasting Sectoral Growth&#13;
&#13;
This annex describes the methodology used by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s country economic team in Kigali in making a&#13;
GDP forecast for Rwanda for the next few years. Three important elements were crucial for putting together the&#13;
GDP forecast. First, a fairly comprehensive database was assembled from available information from the National&#13;
Institute of Statistics of Rwanda. Second, a large number of indicators relevant in explaining sectoral growth were&#13;
also compiled. Third, attempts were made to select a set of behavioral relations, that would facilitate forecasting&#13;
in the short-run.&#13;
&#13;
The forecast is based on the national accounts data published by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda&#13;
for past years, which is traditionally presented for a substantial breakdown by sub-sectors. For example, the&#13;
Rwanda national accounts show five different sub-sectors for agriculture, four sub-sectors for industry, and nine&#13;
sub-sectors for services. It should also be noted that under industry, manufacturing is further sub-divided into&#13;
seven sub-sectors. The aggregate national accounts data for the country thus shows nineteen sub-sectors in the&#13;
published tables.&#13;
&#13;
In consideration of the volume of work involved in incorporating forecasts for all these nineteen sub-sectors, it was&#13;
decided to focus attention on the most important sub-set. Thus, taking into account the weight of each sub-sector&#13;
in the overall GDP, it was decided to limit the analysis to the following ten sub-sectors: food crops, export crops,&#13;
manufacturing and construction, wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage and communications, real estate&#13;
and business services, public administration, education, and other personal services.&#13;
&#13;
An important element of the exercise had been to assemble appropriate databases to determine any empirical&#13;
regularities that can be discovered in each of the ten sectors under study. Thus, a considerable volume of data had&#13;
been gathered on various indicators closely correlated with developments in a given sector. This body of data can&#13;
be considered as â&#128;&#156;leading indicatorsâ&#128;? of the sectors in question.&#13;
&#13;
The other key methodological element in the current exercise had been to capture as far as possible, what may&#13;
be considered as important regularities in the behavior of the selected sectors of the economy. These regularities&#13;
(which are largely historical because of the use of time series for the recent past) are assumed to be informative&#13;
about the future, especially in the short run. However, things could turn out to be quite different from prior&#13;
expectations. Thus, the methodology relies on a probabilistic approach. While it would have been appropriate&#13;
and useful to present the forecasts with confidence intervals, the results of the exercise are presented as point&#13;
estimates purely from the perspective of convenience.&#13;
&#13;
The estimation of a number of relationships explaining the behavior of value added in each of the selected sectors&#13;
was performed. These estimates have to be treated as indicative for several reasons. First, it has not been possible&#13;
to assemble reliable time series on several key variables. Second, the quality of the assembled data still needs&#13;
improvement. Third, it has not been possible to conduct the usual tests of the time series properties of the data.&#13;
Fourth, due consideration has to be taken of technical issues such as omitted variables bias in the estimated&#13;
equations, and the issue of simultaneity in the system as a whole. The team hopes nevertheless, that a foundation&#13;
for future work has been laid with the approach taken in the current exercise.&#13;
&#13;
Forecasting is rather complex because the future is largely unpredictable. This is more so in the current uncertain&#13;
global environment brought about by the economic crisis in the major developed countries since 2008, including&#13;
the US and the Euro zone. As more experience is gained in building information about â&#128;&#156;leading indicatorsâ&#128;? for&#13;
Rwanda and estimation and use of empirical relationships, it is hoped that the present exercise could be improved&#13;
in the next rounds.&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Agriculture&#13;
Food Crops projection: The methodology is based on a two-step procedure, from estimates of volumes of crop&#13;
production to sector GDP. First, volumes of crop production have been estimated. Agriculture is rain fed and in the&#13;
first half of 2012, Rwanda has experienced delayed but abnormal heavy rains and floods, and this has likely impacted&#13;
crop output adversely at the end of season B. However, given substantial past and ongoing public investments&#13;
in the sector, it was estimated that the production will not be too much affected. Therefore, the production of&#13;
the season B was estimated by using trend extrapolations. For the year 2013, volumes of production were also&#13;
estimated by using trend extrapolations. With the volume of crops issue sorted out, the next step was to link that&#13;
to GDP in the crops sector. In contrast, lumping together crops production data for the two agricultural seasons&#13;
may not make sense as it creates a methodological issue for the projections part of the exercise. The reason is that&#13;
the two seasons may be influenced by different factors. The degree of disaggregation to be considered has been&#13;
an important issue in view of data and other considerations. A manageable number of sub-sectors was considered&#13;
to be around five, at best. This means only five types of crops: cereals, pulses, bananas, tubers and vegetables&#13;
were used. While a great deal of details are available for the above five sub-sectors, it has been found convenient&#13;
to limit the analysis to one â&#128;&#156;food cropsâ&#128;? sector. A more detailed sub-sector classification should be considered only&#13;
for the next round.&#13;
&#13;
Export Crops: The methodology is based on first estimating the volume of exports and then using that to arrive&#13;
at value added in export crops production. An estimate of world commodity price movements in the near future&#13;
was obtained. The nuance of the method is to avoid judgments about the volume movements (either from trends&#13;
or other means). Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s key export crops are tea and coffee. According to past trend production, especially for&#13;
coffee, one year with low production is followed by one year with high production (the natural coffee cycle). 2011&#13;
was a year with a low production, and 2012 is expected to be a year with higher production. For tea, every three&#13;
years of increasing production are followed by a decrease in tea production. This leads us to project a decline in&#13;
production of tea in 2012. Furthermore, the experience in the past years showed that with an increased coffee&#13;
production, overall export values are expected also to increase. Although the global price of coffee is projected to&#13;
decline on international markets, it was expected that this will be balanced by a high coffee production in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
2. Industry&#13;
The most important industries in Rwanda are mining, manufacturing, electricity and water, and construction&#13;
sectors. Of these, manufacturing and construction account for 95 percent of industrial activities. In the&#13;
manufacturing sector, well over 65 percent of the output can be attributed to food processing and beverages and&#13;
tobacco processing. Thus, it has been attempted to capture the growth of manufacturing (with emphasis on food&#13;
processing), and construction sub-sectors. For construction sub-sector, the main assumption was based on large&#13;
ongoing public infrastructure investments, but at a slower pace. For the other sub-sectors, trend extrapolations&#13;
for projections have been used.&#13;
&#13;
3. Services&#13;
An attempt was made to explicitly account for all the major services sub-sectors in the Rwandan economy. Particular&#13;
attention was devoted to the following sub-sectors: wholesale and retail trade, transport and communications,&#13;
real estate and business services, public administration and education. In the current analysis the following sub-&#13;
sectors have been grouped into â&#128;&#156;other servicesâ&#128;?: hotels and restaurants, finance and insurance, and health and&#13;
other personal services. It has to be noted that this aggregation is somewhat arbitrary, and any of the above sub-&#13;
sectors can be separately highlighted as there are separate value added figures available for each of those sectors&#13;
in the national accounts.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                       Annex 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wholesale and Retail Trade: The volume of wholesale and retails trade is closely related to the volume of imports&#13;
and the domestic transactions in the non-traded sectors. The latter variable however could pose a problem since&#13;
one of the key aspects of the whole exercise is also to get a forecast of the domestic economy. For simplicity, only&#13;
the volume of imports variable has been used in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Transport and Communications: Transport and communications are closely related to what happens in the&#13;
wholesale and retail trade. Thus, in explaining the behavior of value added in this sector, two key proxy variables&#13;
that have been used are, the volume of imports and exports. The estimated equation has a reasonably good fit for&#13;
quarterly data.&#13;
&#13;
Real Estate, Business Services: Real estate and business services cover a wide variety of services, which makes it&#13;
not always easy to identify few explanatory variables. However, it has been conjectured that perhaps the degree&#13;
of urbanization may be a relevant variable to capture the behavior of the sector. Indeed the simple regression of&#13;
value added in this sector on the degree of urbanization (represented by the share of urban population to total)&#13;
shows that 86 percent of the variations in value added in the sector can be explained by the urbanization variable.&#13;
&#13;
Public Administration: Perhaps the most relevant explanatory variable for value added in public administration is&#13;
the total expenditure of government in a given year. The simple regression estimated shows that 94 percent of the&#13;
variations in value added in public administration can be explained by the variations in total public expenditures.&#13;
The latter explanatory variable turns out to be highly significant.&#13;
&#13;
Education: Enrolments in primary and secondary education are assumed to be reasonably good indicators of the&#13;
volume of transactions in the education sector. The regression results show that almost 98 percent of the variations&#13;
in the value added in the education sector can be explained by the two enrolment variables. The elasticity of&#13;
value added in education with respect to primary enrolment is estimated to be around 0.9 while for secondary&#13;
enrolments it is around 0.7. Both estimated coefficients are significant, as indicated by the t-ratios.&#13;
&#13;
Other services (incl. health, other personal services, hotels and restaurants): Several sub-sectors are included&#13;
in this category of â&#128;&#156;other servicesâ&#128;?. These are: hotels and restaurants, health and other personal services). The&#13;
projections for these sectors are largely based on recent trends.&#13;

            Rwanda grew at a rapid rate in the
            second half of 2011, exceeding 10 percent for the first
            time, since the 2009 global economic downturn. Overall,
            Rwanda achieved 8.6 percent growth in 2011, and
            substantially exceeded the average growth for Sub- Saharan
            Africa (SSA) of 5.0 percent. Rwanda also grew fastest than
            all the countries in the East African Community (EAC), which
            as a group reached 6.1 percent in 2011. Robust growth
            continued in the first quarter of 2012, when Rwanda's
            economy expanded at 7.7 percent. Renewed concerns over the
            global growth outlook and of the European debt crisis, might
            negatively affect Rwanda's prospects in 2012/2013, and
            lead to a lower growth turn-out compared to 2011. First
            quarter growth in 2012 remained overall robust, but showed
            considerable weakness in the industry sector. This was in
            contrast to what was observed in the second half of 2011,
            when industrial growth led by buoyant construction, and
            mining activities pushed the sector to the top, ahead of
            services. In the second half of 2011, Rwanda's growth
            momentum accelerated largely led by thriving non-tradable
            goods and services sectors while the manufacturing sector
            continued to be sluggish. The Rwandan economy expanded by
            10.8 percent during the second half of 2011, but
            manufacturing only contributed 0.5 percentage points to this
            growth outcome. Agricultural output took a leap in the
            second half, mainly due to a very good second harvest season
            outcome. Overall, growth turn-out for 2011 stood at 8.6
            percent, up from 7.2 percent in 2010. Inflationary pressures
            reappeared in tandem with high international food and fuel
            prices. The small policy response came with a delay, not
            enough to prevent core inflation reaching its highest level
            since mid-2009. Core inflation exceeded headline inflation
            for the whole second half of 2011. The current account
            deficit broadened in 2011. Rwanda's export performed
            robustly, benefiting from high international prices, but
            could not keep up with the increasing import bill, leading
            to a further deterioration in the trade balance. For 2012,
            Rwanda's economy is expected to continue to grow slower
            than it did in 2011, but at a healthy pace. The industrial
            sector is likely to expand less than in 2011 and growth in
            the services sector is expected to be more moderate, both on
            account of a more risky global environment.
