ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJET SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:    Republic of Benin&#13;
Beneficiary:  National Environmental Agency&#13;
Amount:      SDR 5.5 million (US$8.0 million)&#13;
Terms:       Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Proiect&#13;
Descrinti:  Over a period of four years the project would support the development of a national&#13;
environmental management capacity and help the Government implement the National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan adopted in June 1993. It would in particular pursue capacity&#13;
building and institutional support, including streamlining and strengthening of national&#13;
environmental responsibilities, reinforcing policy implementation and coordination&#13;
mechanisms, promoting better preparation and enforcement of the environmental&#13;
regulatory framework, developing an effective information system and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation capacity. The project would also promote public awareness of environmental&#13;
issues and the integration of environmental considerations in the education system.&#13;
To achieve these objectives, the project would finance investments designed to:&#13;
1. Improve the national environimental management capacity through support to the&#13;
National Environmental Agency to permit: (a) better definition of environmental&#13;
responsibilities for enhanced integration of environmental issues in the design, planning,&#13;
and implementation of sectoral policies and programs at central and decentralized level; (b)&#13;
implementation of an environmental assessment policy including finalization and adoption&#13;
of the regulatory framework, procedures, guidelines, and monitoring mechanisms; (c)&#13;
preparation and monitoring of the implementation of contingency plans and quality control,&#13;
including the definition of norms and standards; (d) the establishment of an effective&#13;
information and monitoring system; and (e) the participation of the civil society in the&#13;
decision-making process with focus on support for decentralized environmental planning&#13;
and management.&#13;
2. Improve the general level of awareness on environmental issues and foster a change in&#13;
attitude through: (a) the integration of environmental considerations in the education&#13;
programs of the primary and secondary cycles and the production of pedagogic manuals&#13;
for the teachers; (b) the preparation of brochures in national languages for the adult&#13;
literacy program; (c) the implementation of a sensitization program and local initiatives in&#13;
primary and secondary schools; (d) a training program and workshops for public officials,&#13;
trainers, journalists, NGOs and special interest groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- jj -&#13;
Benefits&#13;
and Risks:      The project would allow the Government to develop the national environmental&#13;
management capacity required to effectively implement and monitor the priority actions&#13;
identified in the NEAP. By dovetailing with on-going activities in the country it would&#13;
reinforce the environmental perspective of sectoral strategies and strengthen institutions&#13;
in their ability to implement programs, monitor compliance with standards and&#13;
procedures, implement an environmental impact assessment policy and enforce&#13;
legislation. It would also contribute to the formulation of sound environmental&#13;
management policies and the implementation of programs and projects which would&#13;
better take into account enviromnental considerations as part of the overall development&#13;
process. The thrust of the project would be to initiate a process of changes in the way&#13;
people understand, deal with, and go about addressing environmental issues. It would&#13;
raise the level of environmental awareness of large segments of the populations through&#13;
actions across a large spectrum, such as the improvement of existing education, literacy&#13;
and agricultural extension programs or through targeted training and workshops for&#13;
important interest groups (public officials, media, women's groups, NGOs, etc..). The&#13;
project would therefore reinforce the national capacity to identify and tackle&#13;
environrmental constraints and favor the participation of the civil society in a&#13;
comprehensive education, training, communication effort.&#13;
The major risks would stem from the difficulty to coordinate and manage long-range&#13;
intersectoral activities and to agree on a sustainable institutional set-up which Would&#13;
minimize dissensions and facilitate implementation. However, the proposed approach to&#13;
strengthen the intersectoral monitoring and coordination functions through a small but&#13;
effective environmental mnanagement agency, while streamlining and clarifying present&#13;
environmental responsibilities, and supporting existing structures and the private sector&#13;
in the implementation of sectoral programs, should avoid institutional conflicts and ease&#13;
management. Although the impact on the national budget for the functioning of such&#13;
agency would be minimal, political support and regular budget allocations would be&#13;
essential to sustain implementation of the environmental agenda. Another risk derives&#13;
from the shortage of qualified local personnel with background and experience on&#13;
environmental problems and solutions. To mitigate this risk an important education and&#13;
training effort would be undertaken&#13;

APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.            Physical characteristics&#13;
1.1          Benin has an area of 113,000 km2 and a population of 4.9 million in 1991, 65 percent of&#13;
whom live in rural areas. The population is increasing at an average annual rate of about 3.2 percent. Its&#13;
geographical distribution is very uneven. Population density varies from 188 inhabitants/km in the coastal&#13;
zone to about 14 inhabitants/km2 in the North. As a result, 63 percent of the population is concentrated on&#13;
12 percent of the land area. The urban population accounts for 35 percent of the total and is increasing at&#13;
4 percent a year (8 percent in Cotonou). Benin is divided into three main climatic zones; sub-equatorial in&#13;
the south, with rainfall between 900 mm and 1,500 mm annually; Guinean-Sudanian in the center, with&#13;
marked temperature variations and an average rainfall between 1,000 mm and 1,200 mm/year; and&#13;
semiarid Sudanian in the north, with rainfall of 900 mm to 1,100 mm/year and high evapo-transpiration.&#13;
Plant cover is relatively uniform, in the form of a very degraded savannah woodland extending from the&#13;
north of the country to some 50 km from the coast. This savannah is interspersed in places with gazetted&#13;
forests. Further south are residual forests, small areas of deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, oil palms&#13;
on the sedimentary zones and coconut trces along the coast. Soils are generally poor, mainly ferruginous.&#13;
Bottom-lands have a higher agricultural potential, but are generally hard to work.&#13;
B.            Economic situation&#13;
1.2          The annual per capita income was about US$410 in 1992. Benin's principal resource is its&#13;
arable land, which makes it potentially self-sufficient in food in overall terms while enabling it to produce&#13;
cash crops such as cotton and palm oil as a source of foreign exchange. The primary sector accounts for&#13;
about 40 percent of GDP, more than 70 percent of domestic exports and employs 70 percent of the active&#13;
population. The average annual rate of growth of agricultural production throughout the 80s until today&#13;
continues to maintain itself at rates above 4 percent. This performance, although remarkable, was largely&#13;
achieved through more extensive utilization of available land. The geographical configuration of Benin,&#13;
together with the deep-water port of Cotonou and its relatively good road and rail network, allows it to&#13;
provide transit services for landlocked countries to its north. The secondary sector accounts for about 12&#13;
percent of GDP, essentially in the form of manufacturing, cement production and limited offshore oil&#13;
resources. The tertiary sector basically consists of informal but vigorous trading activities.&#13;
1.3          Between 1983 and 1987 Benin's economy grew only slowly, partly as a result of a decline&#13;
in trade and a collapse of the regional transit traffic, but more particularly as a consequence of the&#13;
inefficiency and poor management of the productive sectors dominated by the State.  In 1989 the&#13;
Government introduced a program of economic reforms prepared with the assistance of the Bank and IMF.&#13;
This program reflected a change in Benin's economic policies, the reduction of the State's role in the&#13;
economy and promotion of private sector activities, a balanced management of public funds, and an&#13;
improved balance of payments situation. In the same time Benin achieved a remarkable political transition&#13;
from a Marxist-Leninist regime to a democratic system and put in place an institutional and policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
framework that permitted to restore growth. Moreover, in order to tackle persistent macro-economic&#13;
difficulties and to restore competitiveness, a major external adjustment was decided in January 1994 by the&#13;
governments of all CFAF countries to devalue their currency relative to the French franc by 50 percent.&#13;
11. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.            Environmental Resources and Issues&#13;
Introduction&#13;
2.1.          Benin still possesses a generous environment, which, if protected and managed with care,&#13;
should be able to satisfy the basic needs of its population and provide the basis for sustainable&#13;
development. There are no climate changes or physical environmental problems which would, in the short&#13;
tern, impair increasing and diversifying production if adequate incentives and sustainable production&#13;
systems were available. Nevertheless, increasing deterioration of Benin's environment has become a major&#13;
cause of concern for the Government. The country's economy is dominated by agriculture, and although&#13;
food security could be achieved and cotton exports expanded with a resulting agricultural growth rate&#13;
above 4 percent throughout the 80s until today, this has often been accomplished through more extensive&#13;
land use, expanding the agricultural frontier to protected forest areas and rangeland. The competition&#13;
between farming, stockraising and forestry, the spread of bush fires, the disappearance of the forest cover&#13;
as a source of fuelwood, the decrease of soil fertility, the silting-up of lagoons and the consequent&#13;
disappearance of fish resources, are all being exacerbated by increasing demographic pressure. It is&#13;
unquestionable that the rapid demographic growth (population almost doubled in the last 25 years) and its&#13;
uneven distribution between the north and the south with uncontrolled expansion of the coastal towns raises&#13;
very serious environmental concerns. No substantial changes have been introduced in agricultural&#13;
production practices while the neglect of the urban environment has led over the years to the degradation of&#13;
the living standards in most of Benin's towns which are ill-equipped to host an expanding population.&#13;
Industrial activities are still limited and do not cause major environmental concerns; they need, however,&#13;
close surveillance.&#13;
Human Resources&#13;
2.2.          The rapid growth rate of Benin's population results in 56 percent of it being under 20 years&#13;
of age, the fertility rate being close to 7 children per woman. This represents a source of dynamism but&#13;
also an important challenge in terms of education, health, employment and overall environmental&#13;
absorption capacity given present technology standards. Life expectancy is about 50 years and literacy&#13;
levels are still low, only 32 percent of adult men and 16 percent of adult women can read and write. These&#13;
serious handicaps contribute in ranking Benin in the 150th place in the world according to the United&#13;
Nations Human Development Index. Urban population grows much faster (5.2 percent per year on&#13;
average) than in rural areas (1.4 percent), showing an important rural exodus which affects mostly&#13;
Cotonou. The major ethnic groups are the Fon (40 percent of the population predominantly in the south),&#13;
the Adja (20 percent and of the same origin), the Yorouba-Nago (12 percent), the Batonou (8.5 percent),&#13;
the Ditamari (6.5 percent) and the pastoralist Peuhl (5.6 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Agriculture&#13;
2.3.          Food production meets on average Bemnn's overall food needs and almost all of it is&#13;
rainfed. Maize is predominantly grown in the southern departments although it is now rapidly expanding in&#13;
the northern areas and is the most widely-planted crop (about 450,000 ha), followed by sorghum in the&#13;
north (130,000 ha), cassava (115,000 ha), yams (90,000 ha), beans (85,000 ha) and peanuts (100,000 ha).&#13;
In most cases food crops are grown in association, and yields are low. Rice production is marginal,&#13;
although its consumption is steadily increasing, most demand being met until now by imports. Cotton&#13;
cultivation has also expanded rapidly in recent years from a production of 70,000 tons of seed cotton in&#13;
1988 to about 178,000 tons in 1992/93 and an estimated bumper crop of 270,000 tons in 1993/94. Yields&#13;
are satisfactory (1,300 kg of seed cottonlha), and the areas planted are still increasing. Cotton constitutes a&#13;
well-organized subsector guaranteeing a floor price to producers, supplies of inputs, credit, and processing&#13;
and marketing of the final product.&#13;
2.4.          Shifting slash and burn cultivation is still the most common practice, to the detriment of&#13;
the natural savannah. Increasingly, fallow land is subject to bush fires or overgrazed. Constant clearing is&#13;
leading to the disappearance of gallery forests and bush. Low watershed seepage and heavy runoff result in&#13;
soil losses which, together with riverbank erosion, lead to the silting-up of watercourses and village wells.&#13;
Farming is penetrating further and further, including into protected areas, bottom-lands and marginal&#13;
zones. Declining soil fertility is the challenge for tomorrow's agriculture, in an economic context in which&#13;
access to chemical fertilizers is still limited (basically to cotton). Mineral exports in the form of cereals and&#13;
root crops are six times higher than eventual restitutions through fertilizers. Further mineral losses result&#13;
from erosion and bush fires. Agriculture is therefore a "mining" activity, and the land is being exhausted in&#13;
the absence of sufficiently long fallow periods.&#13;
2.5.          In the north, fires are responsible for the destruction of 50,000 ha/year, and land is cleared&#13;
for cotton and yams at an annual rate of around 1 00,000 ha. The Karimama district in northern Borgou is&#13;
showing clear signs of desertification, and the adjacent Kandi and Banikoara districts to the south are&#13;
showing the same symptoms as Karimama a few years ago. Cotton, because of its rapid expansion in&#13;
recent years, is often held responsible for the increasing clearing of new land in the north and for the loss of&#13;
soil fertility. However, through fertilizer applications, cotton is the only crop which systematically retums&#13;
part of the nutriments back to the soil. In the south, demographic pressure has led to excessive&#13;
fragmentation and a significant reduction in fallow periods, which, with no improvements in crop practices,&#13;
have negative effects on soil fertility.&#13;
Land Tenure&#13;
2.6.          Small holdings predominate everywhere, along with traditional methods of land&#13;
conveyance and allocation. Average farm size is about 1.7 ha for a seven-person family, the average&#13;
ranging from 0.4 ha in the south, where only 5 percent of farms exceed 5 ha, to 12.7 ha in the north, with&#13;
20 percent of farms over 5 ha. Access to land is extremely difficult in the south, where it is increasingly&#13;
common for land to be sold and demographic pressure has led to over-exploitation of agricultural&#13;
resources. There has been no real improvement in production methods that would lead to a sustained&#13;
increase in productivity. In the north, traditional systems predominate; land is often negotiated and&#13;
allocated in symbolic terms but the concession remains precarious. The absence of cultivation practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
designed to promote a sustainable agriculture, has resulted in farmers and stockraisers losing interest in&#13;
maintaining and managing their land assets.&#13;
2.7.           The current land ownership situation features complex rules and customs that govern&#13;
rights to land and water points. Modem legal systems embodying the right to exclusive ownership have&#13;
been superimposed on the traditional system deriving from collective ownership. The heavy pressure on&#13;
land in the south is constantly giving rise to litigation among neighbors. On the other hand, in the north,&#13;
newcomers move into previously uncultivated areas, sometimes in uncontrolled fashion, and are accepted&#13;
by the existing population, with or without the sanction of the land chief, to the extent of land availability.&#13;
Unless a deed is registered, there is no legal framework for the registration or recognition of customary land&#13;
ownership or use. The absence of legislation or of a rural land register, particularly in southern areas where&#13;
land availability is increasingly rare, means that the land tenure system does not make for optimum use of&#13;
the land. There is a need to adapt Benin's land tenure policy to the various prevailing situations, without&#13;
imposing a system alien to local procedures, which are still partly effective.&#13;
Livestock&#13;
2.8.           Stockraising, with about I million cattle, 2 million small ruminants and half a million&#13;
hogs, represents one fifth of agricultural production (9 percent of GDP). About 7 million ha of available&#13;
pasture are only partially utilizable in the absence of watering points. Three quarters of this area is in the&#13;
northem provinces, where the low utilization of space gives rise to traditional extensive stockraising.&#13;
Animal traction has expanded rapidly, particularly in the cotton production zones; it has contributed to the&#13;
growth of cultivated areas, sometimes to the detriment of the rational exploitation of natural resources.&#13;
Potential animal production in northern Benin is high in terms of pastures, but is limited by poor&#13;
management of surface water resources, archaic production systems and increasing competition from&#13;
crops. Feed and water problems often result in overgrazing and rapid environmental degradation.&#13;
2.9.          The transhumant stockraising is an increasingly heavier burden on the natural pastures.&#13;
During the dry season it leads to bushfires and to tree lopping and pollarding, to allow the herds to browse&#13;
among the new shoots. The straying of animals into crops also gives rise to conflicts with farmers and&#13;
makes any planting of forest species a hazardous operation. Controlling herd movements is a prerequisite&#13;
for the integration of forestry into farming systems. While domestic transhumance is relatively well&#13;
integrated in the national land use patterns, large-scale cross-border transhumance is difficult to control. It&#13;
is extending further and further into the south of the country, where it is responsible for severe degradation&#13;
and conflicts. Cross-border transhumance is in principle governed by the Livestock and Meat Economic&#13;
Community (CEBV)2 regulations, which allow the free movement of herds between Niger, Mali, Burkina&#13;
Faso, Togo and Benin. However, the articles of the agreement are not suited to the ecological and&#13;
economric context of cross-border transhumance.&#13;
2CEBV in principle governs cross-border transhumance and regulations, which allow the free movement of herds&#13;
between Niger, Mali, Burkina, Togo and Benin. However, the articles of the agreement are not suited to the&#13;
ecological and economic context of cross-border tranhumance. Togo does not comply and Benin has become the&#13;
heaven of Sahelian herds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Forests and Fuelwood&#13;
2.10.        Although some form of tree cover is found on about 65 percent of Benin's territory, the&#13;
natural resources situation shows evidence of advanced degradation. In rural areas the issue is essentially a&#13;
matter of changing/eliminating vegetation and reducing soil fertility. The mangrove cover of the lagoon&#13;
ecosystem is also decreasing steadily. The deterioration results from the pressure deriving from shifting&#13;
agriculture, overgrazing, bush fires and fuelwood collection. Only some 200,000 ha are still covered with&#13;
species of economic value, while the bulk of the cover consists of the most open stands, namely woodland&#13;
and bush savannah. Some 1.3 million ha (10 percent of Benin's land area) are officially protected as&#13;
gazetted forests and about 4,000 ha as reforestation areas. However, areas of significant but unknown size&#13;
within these protected areas are being cleared for farming, hunting and stockraising.&#13;
2.11.        Fuelwood consumption, currently estimated at 5.2 million tons, is increasing in line with&#13;
the growth of the rural population; this has led to significant pockets of deforestation in some areas and to&#13;
all-around uncontrolled exploitation. Wood is the principal source of fuel for at least 80 percent of the&#13;
population. Currently, the cutting of forest timber is prohibited except from old state-managed teak&#13;
plantations (around 35,000 m3), part of which is exported and the rest is insufficient to meet national&#13;
needs. The supply of construction poles (about 86,000 m3) from thiinning and clearing exceeds demand.&#13;
The growing need for fuelwood is leading to deforestation all around the towns, incipient desertification&#13;
(Malanville, Boukoumbd, Ouake) and a shortage of free fuelwood. In southern areas, the problem is&#13;
further amplified by the density of the population and the near-complete occupation of the land by crops.&#13;
There is also considerable laxity in enforcing fuelwood collection taxes and in checking export permits,&#13;
particularly in the Malanville region, from which significant amnounts of wood are taken to Niger and&#13;
Nigeria.&#13;
Wildlife. National Parks and Reserves&#13;
2.12.        About 750,000 ha of national parks and 580,000 ha of hunting zones are under&#13;
Government protection along the Benin northern border. The contiguous national parks of the Pendjari and&#13;
W together with the three neighboring hunting areas of the Pendjari, Atacora and Djona constitute a vast&#13;
and undivided area. It represent one of the largest and richest reserves in West Africa and still shelters large&#13;
numbers of wildlife species which have become rare or extinct elsewhere. It extends across the borders of&#13;
Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger to constitute a protected zone of about 25,000 km2 and offers good&#13;
prospects for tourism development. The park of the Pendjari has been declared a Biosphere Reserve by&#13;
MAB-UNESCO in 1986 and has benefited from development projects through the EU (rehabilitation) and&#13;
the CFD (tourism infrastructure). Today the Pendjari represents a relatively well known reserve which&#13;
attracts a still modest number of about 3,000 tourists per year and where problems of nomadic&#13;
transhumance and human encroachrnent are limited. However, with the end of external financing in 1990,&#13;
poor infrastructure maintenance and weak control measures together with the increasing population&#13;
pressure and poaching, are threatening the results achieved so far. On the other hand the larger bloc of the&#13;
W and Djona has been completely neglected, infrastructure and tourism are almost non-existent, poaching&#13;
and livestock pasturing are very common, fauna resources were considered important but a recent&#13;
overflight by IUCN indicated a severe resource depletion of the Park. Hunting activities have been&#13;
permitted in 1990 in the Pendjari and in 1992 in the Atacora hunting zones, but not in the Djona. The&#13;
hunting zones are attributed under annual concession contracts to private operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
2.13.         Both parks are in woodland and savanna area and enjoy, in principle, protection by the&#13;
authorities. In practice they are suffering from poaching, grazing, bush fires and encroachment by farmers&#13;
and the administration's protection policy has often been ineffective. All these areas are managed by the&#13;
Forestry Administration through a decentralized sub-Directorate for the National Parks which also has&#13;
control over a number of forestry posts inside the reserves. The Forestry Administration also collects and&#13;
manages the revenues generated by tourism and hunting activities through a local fund established during&#13;
the previous EU  supported project. Such arrangements have proven their limitations in terms of&#13;
involvement of the local communities and associations, incentives to a better valorization of the Parks'&#13;
potential, transparency in management, cost-effectiveness of maintenance works and local participation.&#13;
Parks' revenues are insufficient to cover the costs but could be reasonably expanded through better&#13;
management.   Anti-poaching measures and strengthening of the most sensitive control posts of these two&#13;
parks are now being promoted through the Natural Resources Management Project. Wildlife management&#13;
pilot operations have also been initiated on two sites bordering the hunting areas with grass-roots&#13;
involvement of the villagers in the management of these buffer zones.&#13;
Water Resources and Pollution&#13;
2.14.         With the gradual thinning or total disappearance of the original tree and shrubs cover, and&#13;
the frequent bush fires, water runoff intensifies on unprotected soils, erosion accelerates and water source&#13;
and well replenishment declines, thus threatening the hydrological balance. Ever larger proportions of&#13;
water reach the lowlands and valleys through soils which have lost infiltration capacity. Water supply in&#13;
the north is insufficient and there is a need to develop new water points for livestock and human needs.&#13;
With the exception of the principal rivers and lake basins, most rivers are seasonal. The Niger, Oueme and&#13;
Mono rivers constitute the main watersheds, the two latter feeding into the coastal lagoon which represents&#13;
the source of fish production and revenues for large segments of the population. The potential in this area is&#13;
far from being fully exploited, although past ambitious attempts to develop irrigation schemes have failed.&#13;
2.15.         Population pressure on the coastal part of the country in the South has generated very&#13;
important environmental stress with potential threats of lagoon pollution and decline in fish production.&#13;
Benin's fishing activities, with a production of about 40,000 tons per year, provide some 50 percent of&#13;
animal protein requirements. Lagoon catch accowuts for two thirds of production. Per capita consumption&#13;
has fallen by half in the last 25 years; production is still declining as a result of problems of lagoon salinity,&#13;
siltation and over-exploitation. Siltation results mainly from deforestation of nearby watersheds for&#13;
fuelwood consumption and for the construction of the traditional fish traps known as the "acadja" fishing&#13;
method, which, although being relatively efficient, represents a serious threat to the mangrove ecosystem of&#13;
the coastal lagoon. In addition the eutrophication of the lagoon from silting leads to its colonization by the&#13;
water hyacinth plant.&#13;
2.16.          The sanitary quality of water is poor and disposal of garbage and human waste represents&#13;
another threat to water quality. The urban population growth is likely to increase the pressure on already&#13;
limited sanitary conditions and increase risks of communicable diseases. According to the World Resources&#13;
Report, about 66 percent and 46 percent of the urban and rural population respectively have access to&#13;
drinking water and 42 percent and 31 percent to sanitation or solid waste disposal facilities. Water&#13;
associated diseases such as malaria, diarrhea and schistosomiasis are endemic and account for high levels&#13;
of morbidity and mortality. Improvement in environmental health conditions will require a substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
improvement in the coverage provided by the water and sanitation services. Monitoring systems to report&#13;
and prevent contamination cases are almost non-existent.&#13;
Coastal Degradation&#13;
2.17.         The coastal ecosystem  experiences an increasing degradation. The urban and port&#13;
development which has taken place in recent years along the coastal areas has exacerbated the problem of&#13;
beach erosion and pollution. Part of the problem of beach erosion can be attributed to the construction&#13;
industry which is causing uncontrolled removal of beach sand, and to the Cotonou port management works&#13;
which modified the sand distribution pattern of the tide. However the phenomenon is generalized&#13;
throughout the African west coast and has a many more complex and broad causes which are not entirely&#13;
known and easy to tackle. Coastal pollution is mainly caused by human wastes and oil spills from ships.&#13;
The small off-shore oil extraction platform could also be the cause of pollution concern and should be&#13;
subject to close monitoring.&#13;
Urban growth&#13;
2.18.         Rapid and unplanned urbanization has resulted in the colonization of areas which are&#13;
unsuitable for construction and regularly flooded. Lack of land tenure security and of urban development&#13;
plans has led to serious inadequacy of basic infrastructure, drainage and sanitation services. The social cost&#13;
of this situation is very high in terms of pollution, health standards, capital losses and unemployment.&#13;
Waste disposal in the main towns is almost non-existent and it is estimated that 75 percent of the wastes of&#13;
Cotonou are not "officially" collected although recently some private firms are helping in the collection and&#13;
disposal of garbage. A small part of it is recycled informally but the bulk is dumped in unauthorized&#13;
garbage tips which represent a major source of pollution. This is even more worrisome knowing that the&#13;
Benin population in 2005 would be close to about 8 million inhabitants of which approximately 45 percent&#13;
may be living in urban areas if the present trends are maintained. The FY92 Urban Rehabilitation and&#13;
Management project has recently started to help the Government tackle some of the identified constraints.&#13;
Energy Sources&#13;
2.19.         Energy consumption is mainly derived from hydro-electric sources and fuelwood. The&#13;
Nangbeto power plant over the Mono river (60 MW) serves consumption needs of both Benin and Togo.&#13;
Fuelwood, however, remains the primary source of energy for most of the population. The pace of&#13;
exploitation of fuelwood is not sustainable and causes serious deforestation concerns. Some projects have&#13;
been initiated to tackle the problem through tree plantations in the coastal areas and introduction of&#13;
improved cook stoves. However, the issue remains one of relative cost of possible alternative sources.&#13;
Fuelwood costs presently only account for its collection and transport, no inherent value is attributed to the&#13;
resource itself and collection of stumpage fees is not enforced. Off-shore oil production at the Semd oil field&#13;
is limited (4,000 barrels/day) and oil is exported unrefined; new potential extraction sites have however&#13;
been identified and could be exploited in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Environmental Awareness and Monitoring&#13;
2.20.         The notion of environment is still a relatively new concept in Benin and environmental&#13;
awareness of the issues at stake has started developing only recently through the NEAP preparation&#13;
process, which was initiated in 1991 and was completed in 1993. The definition of environmental concerns&#13;
and issues varies considerably from one segment of the population to the other and from the north to the&#13;
south of the country. Moreover, information on environmental problems and solutions is rare or difficult to&#13;
access. There is no environmental education in schools nor is environmental science taught in the&#13;
University. Not only are general education and communication programs lacking, but specific information&#13;
and data on the status of the environment in Benin are fragmented and obsolete.  Institutional&#13;
communication within Ministries or between the central services and local authorities is minimal.&#13;
Moreover, public officials lack the capacity and training to be able to respond in a meaningful way to&#13;
environmental considerations, and issues are often debated in the abstract. In addition to specific local&#13;
needs including the management of watersheds, forest sites, pasture, etc., there is an urgent nationwide need&#13;
for resources inventory, updating existing thematic maps, monitoring erosion, plant cover, population&#13;
density, etc.. Only the recent activities of the National Remote Sensing Center (CENATEL) are&#13;
progressively catching up with the existing gap. Moreover, the need to establish an effective environmental&#13;
information system through the establishment of a network of information exchange, has been strongly&#13;
expressed during the NEAP process.&#13;
B.            Institutions&#13;
2.21.         A new Ministry of Environment, Housing and Urban Planning (MEHU) was created in&#13;
August 1991 as part of the reorganization of Government structures. While it is intended to play a&#13;
coordinating role in the environmental sector, define the regulatory framework, update national policies and&#13;
enforce the legislation, its focus is presently mostly devoted towards urban environmental aspects. MEHU&#13;
comprises four Directorates for: Environment, Urbanism and Sanitation, Housing and Construction, and&#13;
Land Use Planning. MEHU is operationally weak, lacking resources and trained staff to be able to&#13;
implement any meaningful activities. The role of the Directorate of Environment in particular should be&#13;
better defined and streamlined with respect to its "green" mandate to avoid redundancy with the Ministry of&#13;
Rural Development. Moreover, MEHU's responsibilities combine both environmental and development&#13;
issues. This has been a source of conflicts and has raised questions of impartiality since MEHU may have&#13;
to police its own actions and those of other Ministries of equal status while its own implementing activities&#13;
are not neutral to the environment. MERU also covers a number of agencies as: the National Geographical&#13;
Institute (IGN) for the supply of basic maps and the set up of a national geodetic network, the Agency for&#13;
Regional Studies of Housing and Urban Development (SERHAU), the Agency for Labor Intensive Works&#13;
(AGETUR) which implements the Urban Rehabilitation and Management Project, and the secretariat of the&#13;
NEAP.&#13;
2.22.        The Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) is responsible for assistance to and regulation&#13;
of crop farming, stockraising, fisheries, forestry and hunting activities, as well as agricultural research.&#13;
Field level dissemination and implementation of agricultural development policies are the responsibility of&#13;
the Regional Action and Rural Development Centers (CARDER) extending the MDR to each department.&#13;
Significant institutional reforms are under way in MDR and the CARDERs with assistance of IDA and&#13;
other donors. The objective is to develop a vital central tool for planning, monitoring and regulation in&#13;
MDR, and to reduce the activities of the CARDERs on tasks normally carried out by the public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
administration in areas such as extension, monitoring and evaluation, supervision of rural works and&#13;
legislation. The Directorate of Forestry and Natural Resources (DFRN) of MDR has authority over forest&#13;
and wildlife management (protection, reforestation, enforcement, training). To this central unit must be&#13;
added the decentralized structures which, as part of the CARDERs, consists of a Directorate in each&#13;
department, a district-level unit and a representative in each commune. In addition, the national parks,&#13;
hunting zones and certain gazetted forests have their own specialized brigades. The DFRN also includes&#13;
the National Remote Sensing Center (CENATEL), which is responsible for continuous surveillance of&#13;
ecosystems, using remote sensing and thematic mapping to help define rural land use policies. CENATEL&#13;
is being presently supported by IDA and GTZ through the FY92 Natural Resources Management Project.&#13;
2.23.         The Ministry of Interior, Security and Territorial Administration is in charge of&#13;
implementing the reform of the territorial administration, the decentralization process and the supervision of&#13;
the local government administration which would entail larger roles for the municipalities in sanitation,&#13;
security, road maintenance, waste disposal, etc.. .However, implementation of the reform is still subject to&#13;
adoption of the related law by the Parliament. This ministry also regulates land tenure issues and civil&#13;
protection in case of natural catastrophes. The Ministry of Plan and Economic Restructuring-coordinates&#13;
and monitors the public investment program and the allocation of external resources; it also includes the&#13;
Directorate for Regional Planning. The Ministry of Energy, Mining and Hydrology is in charge of the&#13;
implementation of the water policy; this includes surface and underground water and its quality control in&#13;
coordination with the Ministry of Health; the ministry is also responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
energy and mining policy. The Ministry of Health-encompasses responsibilities for the provision of health&#13;
services, information, promotion of sanitation and control of hygienic standards.&#13;
2.24.         More than three hundred Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Development&#13;
Associations are registered in Benin and involved in different domains of socio-economnic and cultural&#13;
activities. Some of them have become active in the promotion and support of villager groups or grass-roots&#13;
initiatives. NGO development in Benin is recent; however, the recent political changes and the new&#13;
encouragement for private initiative have led to a remarkable growth of local development associations and&#13;
national NGOs that are destined to play an expanding role in the development process. A Council of Non-&#13;
Governmental Organizations (CONGAB), a National Federation of NGOs (FENONG), and a NGO&#13;
Coalition for Environment and Sustainable Development, were created respectively in 1988, 1991 and&#13;
1994 to coordinate NGO activities and promote discussions with the government; however their activities&#13;
are hampered by lack of funds and their role and representativeness are not fully accepted by all NGOs.&#13;
NGOs intervene predominantly in the areas of natural resources management, extension of small credit&#13;
lines, provision of basic health care, training and education, and construction of small infrastructure. The&#13;
Ministry of Plan is aware of the necessity to coordinate NGO activities and is setting up a unit responsible&#13;
for establishing a roster of NGOs and to promote collaboration. The NEAP preparation process has also&#13;
been the occasion for some of the environmentally focused NGOs to work together with Government&#13;
services and to be better known.&#13;
2.25.         The media and journalists groups play an important role in the diffusion of the information&#13;
and the implementation of communication programs. The NEAP process has initiated the constitution of an&#13;
environmental desk composed of national joumalists from the press and the television who have benefited&#13;
from specific training, which spearheads the preparation of environmental information for the media.&#13;
Religious authorities and organizations are well respected and listened to; they have a positive attitude&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
towards the protection of the environment and could be an important vehicle in the propagation and&#13;
implementation of environmental programs.&#13;
C.           Policy and refulatorv framework for environmental manaaement&#13;
2.26.         The country's concem for the protection of the environment started with the national&#13;
seninar sponsored by CILSS on the campaign against drought and desertification held at Parakou in April&#13;
1985. A number of resolutions were adopted identifying sector objectives; but either action plans or the&#13;
resources to implement them were not defined, therefore no real implementation took place. Hence, despite&#13;
the Government's recognition of the critical importance of sound management of natural resources,&#13;
corresponding policy issues have always been discussed in the abstract. In terms of legislation, a number of&#13;
codes were adopted in 1987 for forestry, public hygiene, water, and regulations for the protection of nature&#13;
and hunting activities. These laws already show the growing concem of the country for environmental&#13;
issues. However, in most cases, they are of a defensive and repressive nature, proved to be difficult to&#13;
enforce, and have had only a limited application. Environmental evaluation of on-going or new activities is&#13;
almost non-existent and new projects are accepted without adequate analysis of their environmental impact.&#13;
2.27.         The major political and policy changes which took place in 1990 together with the&#13;
implementation of a successful democratization process represent a fundamental milestone in the revision&#13;
of Benin's development strategies and economic refomis. The new Beninese Constitution of 1990 clearly&#13;
states that access to a healthy and sustainable environment is one of the fundamental rights of all citizens.&#13;
The overall response of Benin to the environmental challenge was initiated in 1991 and built around the&#13;
preparation of a National Environmental Action Plan. The NEAP in its conception aimed at defining the&#13;
policy and institutional framework to promote sustainable development, national priorities, and the means&#13;
to improve implementation capacity. In addition to a number of relevant on-going sectoral activities,&#13;
actions would be initiated thereafter to help the Govemment implement and monitor the NEAP together&#13;
with complementary programs in agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors. The NEAP preparation&#13;
process was completed in June 1993 with its formal adoption by the Government. However, although its&#13;
adoption was an important step, the NEAP approach should be viewed as a continuous and evolving&#13;
process of awareness raising and integration of environmental considerations within national development&#13;
plans and sectoral programs. The Government has been very responsive in causing environmental issues to&#13;
become national priorities, it has initiated the review of most of the sectoral policies and is already&#13;
implementing or preparing, with IDA and other donors support, a number of projects or initiatives which&#13;
fall within the NEAP, and already contributes to its implementation by tackling some of the identified&#13;
constraints (see Annex I).&#13;
2.28.         Under the NEAP process or in coordination with it, the regulatory and policy framework&#13;
has been reviewed and modifications have been proposed. This would be continued under the proposed&#13;
capacity building component of this project. The present status of these activities is as follows:&#13;
A new forestry code has been prepared in the context of the NRM project and adopted in&#13;
1993. It includes the definition and recognition of rights held by rural populations on forest&#13;
resources under management plans and the possibility of rehabilitating natural forests with&#13;
local participation in the context of management plans and possible revenue sharing&#13;
between local communities and the Administration. A new forestry policy has also been&#13;
adopted in November 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
*     A new environmental code ("loi cadre") has been prepared during the NEAP preparation&#13;
process and has been submitted for adoption to Parliament. In the framework of this law,&#13;
procedures and guidelines will be defined for implementation of an environmental impact&#13;
assessment policy and monitoring of quality standards.&#13;
*     A new law for the reform of territorial administration, presently with the Parliament for&#13;
adoption, will represent a major step in the decentralization of the decision making process&#13;
for important environment-related issues. Similarly, the issue of giving authority to the&#13;
municipalities for local collection and management of tax revenues would enhance the&#13;
participation of the beneficiaries in the management of urban activities (waste disposal,&#13;
road maintenance, sanitation).&#13;
The Government is also committed to review the land tenure legislation (the present code&#13;
dating from 1965 is not implemented). Pilot operations to better understand the utilization&#13;
of and access to land rights under different agro-socio-economic circumstances are&#13;
presently on-going through the NRM project.&#13;
*     A National Conservation Strategy is being finalized writh the assistance of IUCN.&#13;
*     A national sanitation policy is being prepared under the auspices of the Ministry of Health&#13;
and MEHU.&#13;
*     A national strategy for the integration of the environment in the education system has&#13;
recently been prepared in the context of the NEAP.&#13;
The revision of most sectoral strategies and action plans is on-going in the context of a&#13;
Round Table process.&#13;
D.            The National Environmental Action Plan&#13;
2.29.         Increasing awareness of environmental constraints, particularly since the change of regime&#13;
and of economic policy in 1990, has led the Government to create in 1991 a new Ministry of Environment,&#13;
Housing and Urban planning (MEHU) to better address environmental issues, and to request the support of&#13;
the international community to help prepare and implement a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).&#13;
IDA, through a Norwegian Trust Fund, the United Nations Soudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), Germany&#13;
and France have closely followed and supported preparation of the NEAP. The preparation process, which&#13;
stands as a model of participatory approach and popular consultation, was initiated in 1991 and the final&#13;
report was adopted by the Government in June 1993. The NEAP was prepared by a Preparation Unit,&#13;
staffed with national experts and consultants under the "tutelle" of an Inter-Ministerial Coordinating&#13;
Committee chaired by the Ministry of Environment. The NEAP is an integral part of the national economic&#13;
and social development policy. By its dynamic nature it will need to be adjusted regularly and will&#13;
constitute the basis for future programs of assistance planning and definition of investment priorities. A&#13;
broad-based consultation process through regional workshops, surveys, thematic studies and national&#13;
seminars permitted to better define the environmenital concerns of the various segments of the population&#13;
and to have a more refined spatial approach for the different agro-ecological zones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The Diagnosis&#13;
2.30.        The diagnosis made during the NEAP indicates that, generally speaking, the main&#13;
environmental problems in Benin are fundamentally linked to the rapid demographic growth, especially in&#13;
the south, to pervasive poverty, and to the discrepancy between the pace of natural resources consumption&#13;
and their regeneration capacity, especially for traditional energy sources. Moreover, sectoral policies have&#13;
until now given only marginal consideration to environmental concerns and very limited enforcement of&#13;
existing legislation. The most important underlying cause may be the lack of awareness and information of&#13;
the general public on the issues at stake and the inaction of the policy makers. The most visible indications&#13;
of environmental degradation are: the shrinkage of forest cover and the threats to biodiversity, the extension&#13;
of land erosion under its different forms, the general deterioration of water quality, and an unbalanced&#13;
urban development with consequent degradation of infrastructure and services. A study on the economic&#13;
impact of environmental degradation was undertaken as part of the NEAP preparation and suggests that a&#13;
conservative estimate of the annual cost of environmental degradation could be in the range of 3 percent to&#13;
5 percent of GDP or about 15 to 26 billion CFAF (see Annex 1).&#13;
The Objectives and the Proposed Strategy&#13;
2.31.         The main objectives of the NEAP are to: (a) promote changes in behavior and attitude in&#13;
favor of a better understanding and increased awareness of environmental problems; (b) restore the balance&#13;
between supply and demand of natural resources and a better conservation and management of the bio-&#13;
diversity heritage; and (c) improve the standards of living of the population. The principles behind these&#13;
broad objectives imply: (a) the participation of all the main actors and segments of the population (public,&#13;
private, NGOs, University) with particular emphasis on groups identified as the key players in the&#13;
implementation of environmental policies such as the women and the youth, the policy makers, the media;&#13;
(b) a focus on awareness raising, information and training; (c) a long term approach and continuity of the&#13;
process; (d) an approach which builds on existing activities, experiences and resources; (e) the sustainable&#13;
contribution of protected areas to economic development; and (f) improved donor coordination.&#13;
The Action Plan&#13;
2.32.        The NEAP policy objectives have been translated into seven priority programs to be&#13;
implemented over a 15 year horizon. They are: (a) institutional strengthening, including the creation of an&#13;
environmental agency, development of an effective information system, monitoring and evaluation capacity,&#13;
adoption and enforcement of legislation and policies to better address environmental concerns,&#13;
implementation of an Environmental Assessment policy and preparation of guidelines for the line&#13;
Ministries; (b) development and implementation of an environmental education, infornation and&#13;
communication program at different levels (primary and secondary schools, trainers, journalists, public&#13;
officials, NGOs, private sector, customary authorities) and establishment of a critical mass of&#13;
environmental specialists; (c) development of applied and adaptive research on sustainable agricultural&#13;
technologies, communal land management, alternative sources of energy, agro-sylvo-pastoral integration;&#13;
(d) conservation and management of the bio-diversity through a better knowledge and monitoring of the&#13;
existing resources, sustainable management of  protected areas through larger decentralization of&#13;
Government responsibilities and involvement of the local communities; (e) preparation and implementation&#13;
of a water management master-plan and strengthening of the water quality control capacity; (f)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
improvement of infrastructure and services in rural areas and the definition of a land tenure management&#13;
policy; (g) improvement of infrastructure and services in urban areas through better planning and&#13;
rehabilitation of urban centers, management of waste disposal, sanitation facilities, pollution and coastal&#13;
erosion control, decentralization and improvement of the municipalities' capacity to manage locally&#13;
collected funds for urban works and maintenance.&#13;
2.33.         Some of these programs have already started or are under preparation and the proposed&#13;
strategy is to build on those and many other activities to avoid redundancy, overlapping of responsibility&#13;
and waste of resources. As implementation of these programs evolves it will be important to assess&#13;
progress, review priorities and update required actions as part of a permanent environmental planning&#13;
process (see Annex 1 for more on the preparation process and the status of implementation).&#13;
E.           Bank Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.34.         Lessons learned from previous IDA involvement. IDA support to the preparation of&#13;
NEAPs in many African countries has become the catalyst of a process which has initiated public&#13;
awareness of the environmental issues at stake and permitted integration of the environment in the&#13;
preparation and implementation of development policies. To maintain momentum and fulfill expectations&#13;
developed during the preparation process, IDA involvement in assisting translate action plans into actual&#13;
implementation of investment programs is essential. Moreover, the intersectoral nature of the exercise&#13;
requires that IDA pursue a strong coordination effort among donors and ensure maximum strategic and&#13;
institutional coherence with on-going activities. Lessons from most of the recent IDA initiatives in Benin&#13;
point to the need for and interest in local community and private sector participation in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of development actions and also the decentralization of the decision making process; at the&#13;
same time, however, strong national coordination among various types of intervention remains necessary&#13;
for overall sustainability and long term development impact.&#13;
2.35.         Rationale for IDA involvement. At Government's request, IDA supported the preparation&#13;
of the NEAP and played the leading role in donor coordination. The NEAP document represents an&#13;
important step for integrating environmental considerations into the overall economic and social&#13;
development strategy. IDA has been instrumental during the whole preparation process in helping the&#13;
Government promote general public awareness on the environment, maintain a high level of policy dialogue&#13;
and initiate new sectoral programs within that framework. The Government has been extremely responsive&#13;
in causing environmental issues to become national priorities. It is IDA policy to foster preparation and&#13;
implementation of the NEAP and integrate it in Bank's country assistance strategy as part of continuing&#13;
dialogue and to ensure macro-economic and sectoral coordination for appropriate assistance and actions.&#13;
The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Benin, last presented to&#13;
the Board in May 1994, which specifically aims at drawing attention to the impact on the environment and&#13;
the protection of natural resources. As an area of Special Emphasis the strategy proposes to assist the&#13;
Governrment to implement the recommnendations of the NEAP and help develop a sound policy base to&#13;
foster integration of environmental considerations into sectoral strategies and programs. The proposed&#13;
project is part of the IDA lending program in both the High Case and Low Case Scenario of the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.            Proiect Rationale and Obiectives&#13;
3.1           Rationale.  Within the NEAP long-term  perspective, the project would help the&#13;
Government initiate a capacity building effort to better address environmental issues. This would be part of&#13;
a multi-donor effort to finance projects and programs which have been generated by or are in line with the&#13;
NEAP recommendations and priorities over a 15 year period. In line with the recommended strategy,&#13;
proposed activities will encompass the underlying trends and initiatives already started or under preparation&#13;
and which already tackle some of the identified constraints. While it is important that environmental issues&#13;
be dealt with in a comprehensive manner, it is also essential that responsibility for integrating and&#13;
strengthening environmental concerns in program implementation remains with sectoral Ministries.&#13;
Moreover, in view of the existing institutional and coordination weaknesses, an important effort would be&#13;
pursued under the project for intersectoral aspects of a horizontal nature, to promote capacity building,&#13;
awareness raising, training, establishment and enforcement of standards and guidelines.&#13;
3.2           Obiectives. The project would aim at utilizing and building national capacity. It would&#13;
pursue the main objective of developing a national environmental management capacity to conceive, plan,&#13;
and implement policies and programs, monitor and enforce legislation, strengthen coordination&#13;
mechanisms, develop an information system and promote better integration of environmental concerns in&#13;
the framework of socio-economic development plans. It would also help improve the awareness,&#13;
understanding and knowledge of environmental issues for the various segments of the population, and&#13;
foster integration of environmental considerations in the education system.&#13;
B.            Summary Proiect Description&#13;
3.3           Over a four year period the project would implement the following main components:&#13;
(a)   Institutional strengthening would support the environmental management, coordination,&#13;
planning, enforcement and monitoring capacity of the Government through the National&#13;
Environmental Agency and support decentralized environmental planning and action-&#13;
oriented initiatives.&#13;
(b)   Monitoring of the regulatory framework and guality control through the i) definition of&#13;
procedures and guidelines; ii) monitor implementation of the regulatory framework and of&#13;
an environmental impact assessment policy; iii) preparation of contingency plans,&#13;
monitoring of quality standards and prevention of environmental risks.&#13;
(c)   Establishment of an effective environmental information management and monitoring&#13;
system that would develop a common architecture to exchange information between&#13;
different structures collecting and retrieving information and meaningfully integrate data&#13;
collected by various sources with different standards and methods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(d)   Development and implementation of an education. information and communication&#13;
progam (EIC) at different levels (trainers, journalists, public officials, NGOs) to promote&#13;
public awareness of environmental issues.&#13;
C.           Detailed Proiect DescriDtion&#13;
1.    Institutional Strengthening (US$4.5 million)&#13;
3.4          This component would aim  at making better use of the national environmental&#13;
coordination, planning, enforcement and monitoring capacity of the Government and strengthen a national&#13;
capacity that would foster better preparation of national policies, enforcement of the legislation, integration&#13;
of environmental perspectives into sectoral strategies and programs, monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
information management. It would also facilitate integration of environmental management in the on-going&#13;
decentralization process and larger participation of local governments and NGOs in decision and policy&#13;
making. This involves the reviewing and streamlining of MEHU's responsibilities and role and setting up&#13;
appropriate mechanisms for addressing environmental concerns at the national level. The intersectoral&#13;
nature of the environmental agenda implies that activities falling under its broad framework would be&#13;
implemented by several executing agencies according to the nature of the proposed actions and to the&#13;
responsibilities already entrusted to the different agencies/Ministries. In general it is envisaged that&#13;
implementation of sectoral components for which a clear responsibility already exists, would be undertaken&#13;
through the existing structures, line departments and NGOs where appropriate. Thus, problems are&#13;
addressed in the context of the activity of which they are part.&#13;
3.5          The mandate of the Directorate of Environment within MEHU is very ambitious but the&#13;
lack of financial and human resources is a serious impediment to implementation of meaningful activities.&#13;
MEHU has also responsibility for housing and urban affairs and has the "tutelle" for the implementation of&#13;
action programs and projects. Entrusting MERU with full coordination and enforcement authority for&#13;
tasks of intersectoral nature, may cause it to police its own and other more powerful Ministries' actions&#13;
while actually being on the same hierarchical level and having a mandate not neutral to the environment.&#13;
This may be source of conflicts and raise questions of impartiality. To address this issue and permit the&#13;
Government to implement effectively its environmental agenda, a specific working group has conducted&#13;
studies and workshops during the NEAP and during project preparation, to propose a realistic institutional&#13;
organization. The mandate of MEHU and particularly of its Directorates of Environment and of Land Use&#13;
Management would be streamlined and strengthened so to emphasize policy preparation and monitoring&#13;
rather than implementation and provide the basis for a more modest but meaningful agenda. MERU's role&#13;
would concentrate on (a) defining and following-up the national policy, (b) environmental planning, (c)&#13;
preparing and overseeing implementation of the legislation, (d) defining the objectives and standards&#13;
related to the sustainable use and quality of natural resources and intervention techniques, (e) authorizing&#13;
and delivering permits for the implementation of activities with potential environmental impact, as defined&#13;
by the legislation, and (f) international negotiations and representation.&#13;
3.6          According to the recommendation of the NEAP, the Government has created in February&#13;
1995 a National Environmental Agency (NEA). The Agency is conceived to be endowed with technical&#13;
skills but also with political clout. It would be small and focused on key priorities, avoid conflicts and&#13;
competition by excluding implementation responsibilities from its mandate. NEA would mainly play a&#13;
catalytic role in the environmental decision-making process, spearhead the environmental agenda and be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
instrument of the Government and of the civil society for assessing environmental impacts, monitoring&#13;
implementation of the regulatory framework, informing and proposing remedial actions to the political&#13;
level. NEA's role will be to address issues of a horizontal nature and help the Government in implementing&#13;
environmental policies and legislation, promoting better integration of environmental concerns into sectoral&#13;
policies and programs, organizing networking for monitoring and planning, monitoring implementation of&#13;
an environmental assessment policy and compliance with standards and regulations, coordinating EIC&#13;
programs and studies, raising awareness, coordinating an environmental information system, informing the&#13;
Government and the public, facilitating contacts with the media and the Parliament. NEA will also play an&#13;
important role in promoting collaboration with the NGO community and local governnents in the&#13;
implementation of pilot activities for the conservation of the environment.&#13;
3.7          Central oversight of NEA would rest with a Steering Committee. chaired by the Minister&#13;
of MEHU and comprising representatives of concerned Ministries, the NGO community, the media&#13;
(environmental desk, see para. 3.21), and the private sector. It would ensure overall monitoring, guidance,&#13;
and arbitration. It would follow-up progress in NEA's working program, discuss its achievements and&#13;
results, promote intersectoral coordination, and sensitize the political level to particular issues. The&#13;
Committee would meet every three to four months and would invite representatives from other&#13;
organizations to participate in meetings, discussions and working groups on specific subjects. NEA's&#13;
Director would provide the secretariat of the Committee and help prepare the documentation to be&#13;
examined by it (programs and budgets, progress reports, studies' results, specific recommendations). See&#13;
Annex 2 for NEA's chart and Annex 3 for distribution of responsibilities. Internal regulations of NEA and&#13;
of the Steering Committee are included in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
3.8          The National Council for Sustainable Development, to be created in the aftermath of the&#13;
Rio Conference and to be chaired by the President or his delegate, would be the general forum which would&#13;
provide the necessary political support in the implementation of the environmental agenda, and high level&#13;
coordination in the follow-up of the various initiatives which are being developed (NEAP, social dimension&#13;
of development, desertification Convention, biodiversity Convention, Montreal Protocol, Dutch bilateral&#13;
Convention for sustainable development). The relevant Minister would present and follow-up the various&#13;
matters according to the underlying initiative or Convention to be discussed. For matters related to NEA's&#13;
tasks, relevant subjects would be presented by the Minister in charge of Environment.&#13;
3.9          A specific capacity building effort would also be targeted in favor of the municipalities and&#13;
local Governments which are in the process of being entrusted with decentralized authority on very&#13;
important environment-related matters such as local tax collection and management, waste disposal,&#13;
sanitation, urban planning, etc.. A small guide on best practices of environmental management would be&#13;
prepared for the use of the local Councils of the primary and secondary towns. Small field activities and&#13;
pilot initiatives, would also be promoted, mainly through NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.     Monitoring of the Regulatory Framework and Quality Control (US$1.7 million)&#13;
3.10          The Regulatory Framework and Environmental Impact Assessments An environmental&#13;
code ("loi cadre") has been prepared as follow up of the NEAP's recommendations; it has been aproved&#13;
by Government and transmitted to the Parliament for adoption. Among other things it would define general&#13;
requirements for the establishment and implementation of an environmental assessment policy. One of the&#13;
main tasks of the NEA would be to help the Government in enforcing its environmental legislation,&#13;
coordinating and supervising preparation of EA guidelines for the different sectors, defining implementation&#13;
procedures and standards, and controlling their application. The Environmental Assessment process would&#13;
be used as the driving force to organize workshops, build consensus, promote decision making and, in the&#13;
end, capacity building. A training effort for local staff in EA methodology and format would be undertaken.&#13;
EAs for new investment operations would be carried out at the expense of the sponsor of the project.&#13;
3.11          Another major task that would be undertaken as part of a capacity building effort is the&#13;
preparation of contingency plans and prevention of environmental risks to help the Government face&#13;
unexpected crises or accidents, promptly implement remedial actions and prevent future nuisances. This&#13;
includes: (a) flooding, (b) leakage or disposal of toxic materials, (c) contamination, pollution and oil spills,&#13;
(d) natural accidents, fires, explosions, etc...This task would include helping the Government to conduct&#13;
environmental auditing, and to enforce quality control measures and standards, with particular reference to&#13;
drinking water and pesticide use. Workshops would be organized to discuss the underlying strategy,&#13;
preparation of preparedness and mitigation plans, and the attribution of responsibilities. At the initiative of&#13;
MEHU and NEA, impact assessments and studies would also be conducted on subjects of national interest&#13;
which are presently sources of concern: (a) the impact of water releases from the hydro-electric power plant&#13;
of Nangbeto on the coastal configuration and downstream human activities (fishing, salt production); (b)&#13;
the potential risk of water contamination; (c) waste management policies; (d) pollution sources and&#13;
pesticides use. NEA would centralize and analyze EAs and submit recommendations to its governing body,&#13;
the Steering Committee.&#13;
3.     Environmental Information Mananement &amp; Monitoring (US$1.6 million)&#13;
3.12          Environmental Information Management and Monitoring is essential for effective&#13;
environmental planning, monitoring and enforcing compliance with regulations, and information of&#13;
decision-makers, the private sector, and NGOs. The main agencies concemed with collection and&#13;
production of environmental information and maps are MEHU, NEA, the National Geographic Institute&#13;
(IGN), the Remote Sensing Center (CENATEL), the Directorate of Hydrology, the Institute for&#13;
Agricultural Research, the National University, the Urban Planning and Housing Research Agency&#13;
(SERHAU), and the Air Navigation Control Agency (ASECNA). Their role has already been extensively&#13;
studied in the context of previous projects and during preparation of the NEAP. Because of the&#13;
intersectoral nature of environmental issues, the most important objective would be to develop an effective&#13;
coordination capacity that would be able to meaningfully integrate data collected by various sources with&#13;
different standards and methods in an Environmental Infomnation System. The need to establish a common&#13;
architecture that would enable exchange of information between different structures collecting and&#13;
retrieving information and to enhance their analytical capacity has been clearly expressed by a specific&#13;
NEAP working group. The project would therefore upgrade existing arrangements, strengthen the&#13;
analytical capacity of the different centers to constitute and maintain relevant data bases, and promote the&#13;
establishment of an information exchange network that would be organized and promoted by NEA as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
central catalyzing element. However, NEA would not be collecting or constituting new data bases or&#13;
competing with existing structures in the network. See Annex 5 for a detailed implementation schedule.&#13;
3.13          In addition, a Coastal Zone Management Study would be undertaken in order to better&#13;
assess present constraints and risks for the coastal area which represents 10 percent of the territory and&#13;
hosts 60 percent of the population, and which is subject to very strong environmental pressures&#13;
(uncontroled immigration, human settlements in unhealthy areas, waste disposal and pollution, loss of&#13;
biodiversity, coastal erosion, etc..). Future development possibilities and action-oriented activities would be&#13;
proposed as part of an action plan. It is proposed to carry out the 1:50,000 mapping of the area and the&#13;
specific studies as required. IGN and SERHAU would be the two main actors for conducting the&#13;
cartography and the studies respectively. (Terms of Reference in the Implementation Manual).&#13;
4.     Environmental Education. Information and Communication (EIC) (US$1.5 million)&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
3.14.         Implementation of an effective environmental policy will not be conducive to sustainable&#13;
development unless it progressively fosters a change in attitudes and behaviors of the different segments of&#13;
the population, each one within his own capacity and activity. Those changes cannot take place unless the&#13;
merits and benefits of Government decisions are explained and understood. The success of the&#13;
implementation of an environmental policy goes through a process of education, training and&#13;
communication. An educated and informed population is in the long term the main factor of economic and&#13;
sustainable development since it will be enabled to better manage and protect its forests, soil, biodiversity&#13;
and make better use of energy and water resources at the household level. Until now the efforts to include&#13;
environmental considerations in education or information programs have been non-existent or marginal.&#13;
The media, local NGOs and academic institutions play an essential role of public information and it will be&#13;
important that their understanding and capacity is upgraded so that the messages conveyed are appropriate&#13;
and that a critical mass of environmental capacity be developed.&#13;
3.15.         The main principles underlying the proposed program  are a) implementation of a&#13;
participatory approach at all levels; b) improvement of the environmental awareness and understanding of&#13;
all segments of the population; c) focus on special groups which play a fundamental role in environmental&#13;
management: women, youth, policy makers and the media; d) progressive upgrading of sector capacity for&#13;
better integration of environmental aspects in the preparation and implementation of sectoral policies&#13;
(agriculture, urban development, energy, health, education). The recent strategy for the integration of&#13;
environment into education programs, elaborated during the NEAP process by INFRE3, would be&#13;
implemented under the proposed project through present education programs rather than through new&#13;
separate curricula.&#13;
3 INFRE (Institut National pour la Fornation et Recherche en Education), within the Ministry of Education, is&#13;
responsible for the conception and preparation of education programs.&#13;
&#13;

Project Activities&#13;
3.16.         Integration of environmental considerations in education programs would be implemented&#13;
in close collaboration with the FY94 Education Project and would dovetail with the reforms being&#13;
promoted in the primary cycle. It would foster better understanding by the teachers of environmental issues&#13;
and promote diffusion of environmentally-related subjects through the existing curricula. The project would&#13;
support the preparation and production of pedagogic guides for the teachers, for the primary and for the&#13;
secondary cycle. The purpose of these guides would be to provide the trainers with the basic knowledge of&#13;
(a) the fundamental mechanisms which deternine the Beninese environment; (b) the major national&#13;
environmental issues; and (c) possible individual and collective ways to protect the environment. Training&#13;
on the proposed approach would also be provided to the education inspectors and teachers' trainers. Such&#13;
training would focus on how to use existing curricula as a vehicle to diffuse environment-related issues.&#13;
Integration of environmental considerations into adult basic teaching would also be pursued and would&#13;
consist in the preparation of brochures and other pedagogic material for the use of teachers involved with&#13;
literacy programs and for reading clubs and associations. This material would be mainly devoted to women&#13;
and would be produced in the six major national languages.&#13;
3.17          An outreach and sensitization program would be developed and implemented in primary&#13;
and secondary schools to encourage local initiatives that would raise awareness and prove beneficial for the&#13;
environment (school theater, organization of visits, surveys and discussions, realization of small activities&#13;
of general interest within the school premises). A pilot phase would be first implemented in a Department&#13;
of the North (rural aspects) and of the South (urban aspects), and eventually expanded if the outreach&#13;
modules prove successful. Activities would also be linked with relevant activities or projects in the field.&#13;
3.18.        Training. An important training effort would be devoted to raise the environmental&#13;
knowledge of public officials and of the society in broad terms. It is proposed to constitute and strengthen a&#13;
core national environmental capacity within the different sectoral specificity of the Ministries mostly&#13;
concemed (environment, health, interior, rural development, industry, water and energy, public works).&#13;
Two high level staff knowledgeable on environmnent in each relevant Ministry would be given a short term&#13;
training in the domain of their competencies related to environmental issues. An enhanced training program&#13;
would also be provided to six staff of the MEHU on environmental planning and management. A common&#13;
training course on Environmnental Impact Assessment would also be provided to the samne staff. Training&#13;
would be provided by specialized centers, possibly from the sub-region. A second refresher training course&#13;
would be provided to the same staff three years later. Continuity of the trained staff on their job would be&#13;
essential for effectiveness of this capacity building effort. The staff of the Agency would also be provided&#13;
with specialized training on specific topics and would undertake study tours to learn from similar&#13;
experiences in other countries. This core of national specialists would contribute to integrate environmental&#13;
concerns in the preparation and implementation of sectoral policies and would represent the sectoral focal&#13;
point for environmental related matters (See planning of training activities in Annex 4).&#13;
3.19.        The training modules for the agricultural extension staff in the field would be reviewed and&#13;
strengthened in collaboration with the FY91 Agricultural Services project so that extension messages take&#13;
more into account the sustainable use of natural resources. Particular focus would be devoted to upgrading&#13;
the level of the subject matter specialists in the CARDERs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.20.        A series of workshops on various topics related to environmental issues  would be&#13;
organized throughout the project life for about 20 participants each time for some special interest groups&#13;
such as: parliamentarians, local authorities, education inspectors and school directors, women associations,&#13;
youth groups and NGOs. In turn, specialized NGOs would be encouraged and supported to organize&#13;
outreach activities and training sessions through schools, cultural centers, women's organizations. The&#13;
project would also support the documentation unit initiated under the NEAP and now established in the&#13;
MEHU with some office equipment and additional documentation.&#13;
3.21.         An environmental desk has been initiated during the NEAP preparation process and is&#13;
constituted by a group of national journalists ftom the press and the television who are interested by or&#13;
involved in environmental subjects. The project, in collaboration with the WANAD4 initiative, would&#13;
strengthen the group through appropriate training and the provision of some office and audio-visual&#13;
equipment for the production of documents, support to communication programs, video cassettes, etc.. This&#13;
would go a long way in improving the professionalism and credibility of the national media. Internship with&#13;
the foreign press would be promoted as well as encouragement of regular contacts with the various&#13;
economic actors and the organization of meetings and workshops. Although the desk would organize itself&#13;
into a more structured entity, its members would continue to be employed by their present organization.&#13;
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A.            Cost estimate&#13;
4. 1          Total project costs over four years, including incremental capital and operating&#13;
expenditures, and contingencies are estimated at CFAF 4.9 billion, i.e US$9.3 million at the exchange rate&#13;
prevailing in Novcmber 1994 (US$1 = CFAF 530), of which 50 percent is foreign exchange. Estimated&#13;
duties and taxes amount to CFAF 352 million (US$0.7 million). Total physical and price contingencies&#13;
amount to about CFAF 485 million (US$0.9 million), i.e. about 11 percent of the total costs. Physical&#13;
contingencies have been included at the rate of 10 percent on goods and works, 5 percent on operating&#13;
costs, and 0 percent on consultant services and salaries. Price contingencies are based on the Bank's&#13;
projected increase of international prices and local prices. The rates applied for foreign goods and services&#13;
are 2.9 percent in 1995 and 1996, 3 percent on 1997 and 2.7 percent, thereafter. Price contingencies on&#13;
local costs are 3 percent in 1995 and thereafter. A Project Preparation Facility of US$200,000 was allowed&#13;
to finance preliminary studies, functioning of the NEAP Secretariat and subsequently of the NEA,&#13;
preparation of an Implementation Manual as well as preliminary training of key project personnel. Project&#13;
costs are summarized below and details are given in Annex 7.&#13;

4.4           Procurenient actions in Benin have overall performed satisfactorily for IDA-financed&#13;
agricultural projects. Sample bidding documents have been established for Benin, and a new procurement&#13;
code, reviewed by IDA, has been approved by the Government and is expected to be adopted shortly by the&#13;
Parliament. There is an adequate number of small and medium size contractors as well as consulting firms&#13;
and individual consultants, who meet the appropriate standards of performance. NEA will be responsible&#13;
for procurement activities. Agreement has been reached at negotiations concerning procurement procedures&#13;
as outlined below as well as the use of Bank's standard bidding documents and the adherence to agreed&#13;
standard procurement processing times. An implementation manual satisfactory to the Bank will be adopted&#13;
before effectiveness (para. 5.4).&#13;
4.5            Civil works and infrastructure. Contracts for the construction of NEA's office would be&#13;
procured through LCB 6 up to an aggregate amnount of US$0.2 million equivalent. Works for the&#13;
implementation of small pilot activities for environmental management or to help in the implementation of&#13;
contingency plans, to be undertaken through NGOs with community participation, difficult to group and/or&#13;
scattered, and costing less than US$20,000 up to an aggregate amount of 0.3 million will be procured&#13;
through community participation in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.6           Goods.  To the extent practicable, vehicles, equipment and supply contracts will be&#13;
grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or more each and procured on&#13;
the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) using Bank's standard bidding documents. ICB&#13;
purchases are expected to total US$1.4 million. Under ICB procurement of goods, goods manufactured in&#13;
Benin will be allowed a preference margin of 15 percent or applicable custom duties, whichever is lower.&#13;
For contracts between US$50,000 and US$150,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.5&#13;
million, local competitive bidding (LCB) procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank will be used.&#13;
Procurement of goods for less than US$50,000 per contract and up to an aggregate amount of US$0.3&#13;
million will be done through prudent shopping (international or local), on the basis of comparison of price&#13;
quotations of at least three suppliers in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.7           Consultancies  Technical assistance, studies, training and consultants financed by IDA&#13;
will be selected in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of consultants. This includes, inter alia,&#13;
audits and accounting services, capacity building for environmental management and for the&#13;
implementation of an environmental education, training and communication program, training, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities, and impact assessment studies. Contracts up to an amount not exceeding US$1.4&#13;
million equivalent would be awarded to training institutions acceptable to IDA, according to the training&#13;
plan to be presented annually together with NEA's work program (para 5.8). Contracts up to an amount not&#13;
exceeding 0.5 million equivalent would be awarded directly to individuals and NGOs reputed for their&#13;
experience in the sector, competence and their history of involvement in Benin. Any sole source would&#13;
require to be acceptable to IDA. Other consultants, studies and training services, encompassing a wide&#13;
range of expertise up to an aggregate of respectively US$2.9 million equivalent, will be procured on the&#13;
6 LCB provides that: (a) 45 days minimum shall be allowed between the availability of bid documents and bid&#13;
submission deadline date; (b) all bids are opened in public and bidders' representatives shall be allowed to be&#13;
present; (c) precise bid evaluation and post-qualification criteria shall be defined in the bid documents; (d) foreign&#13;
companies shall not be requested to obtain registration. income tax and social security clearances to participate in&#13;
the bidding process; (e) award should be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (f) rejection of any lower bid&#13;
subject to prior Bank review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
basis of a short list of qualified firms/consultants/institutions. Prior review would be required for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$50,000 equivalent for firms and US$25,000 equivalent for individuals&#13;
each. The Bank continues to require prior review for: (a) terms of reference of consultant contracts&#13;
regardless of value; (b) all contracts for assignment of critical nature regardless of value; and, (c) any&#13;
standard documents that the borrowers intends to use repeatedly. As a condition of effectiveness the&#13;
Government will prepare and send to the Bank contracts for the recruitment of external auditors and for the&#13;
establishment of an accounting and financial monitoring system to the Bank.  Contract signing between&#13;
NEA and a foreign firm for regular short term technical support will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.8           Service contracts for the provision of satellite imagery, aerial photographs and base maps,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$0.1 million equivalent, will be awarded through limited international&#13;
bidding (LIB) given their specific nature and the limited number of contractors. The established list of&#13;
contractors will be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
4.9           Operating costs. including travel costs and allowances, utilities, office supplies,&#13;
communications, operation and maintenance for office, vehicles and equipment, up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$0.8 million, given their nature, do not involve procurement.&#13;
4.10          Review of procurement decisions. Bank prior review will be needed for all contracts of&#13;
civil works and goods estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent; the Bank will however review&#13;
the first three LCBs. Bank's prior review will cover advertising, draft tender documents, bid evaluation,&#13;
award proposals and draft contracts. Contracts for procurement of works and goods falling below the prior&#13;
review threshold, will be subject to random review by the Bank after contract award. Procurement&#13;
information would be reported in the annual progress report to be prepared by project management so as to&#13;
revise cost estimates and timing of procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract awards and&#13;
completion time for individual contracts, and compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of&#13;
procurement. The Consultancies Plan is in Annex 4, the Project Implementation Schedule is in Annex 5,&#13;
and the Project Procurement Schedule is in Annex 6.&#13;
D.           Disbursement&#13;
4.11          Given the Government's limited ability to pre-finance project expenditure and to make&#13;
management more effective and expedite disbursements, a special account, denominated in CFAF, would&#13;
be opened in a commercial bank in Cotonou, acceptable to IDA, and managed by NEA's Director. Once&#13;
the credit becomes effective, IDA would make an initial deposit of US$500,000 equivalent for NEA,&#13;
covering 4 months of IDA-financed eligible expenditures. The special account would be replenished&#13;
monthly or more often when the total disbursed amounts to one third of the initial deposit, whichever is&#13;
sooner. The Director and a financial controller would be responsible for managing the special account and&#13;
would be its signatory. Disbursements will be fully documented except for expenditures for operating costs,&#13;
training, and contracts costing less than US$100,000 equivalent which will be eligible for reimbursement&#13;
on the basis of Statement of Expenditure (SOE). SOE will also be used for services under contracts not&#13;
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent with consulting firms or US$ 25,000 equivalent with individuais. All&#13;
expenditures above US$100,000 equivalent, will be eligible for direct payment by the Bank.&#13;
Documentation of SOEs will be made available for review by Bank supervision missions and auditors.&#13;
&#13;

4.12          The disbursement profile for agricultural projects in Benin suggests that the project would&#13;
be disbursed over a period of seven and one half years (see disbursement profile in Annex 8). However,&#13;
given the nature of the project which mainly deals with capacity building and institutional strengthening, it&#13;
is estimated that the project would be disbursed over six years. All the disbursements of the IDA credit will&#13;
be net of identifiable duties and taxes. The disbursement by categories will be as follows:&#13;

contribution to NEA's expenditures. This account will be replenished by the Government to meet the&#13;
annual requirement of CFAF 70 million. Evidence of the initial deposit will be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
E.            Financial Mana2ement, Accountin! and Audit&#13;
4.14          In order to ensure rapid and efficient establishment of the accounting and financial system,&#13;
an internationally known firm would be contracted as a condition of effectiveness of the credit for a period&#13;
of two months to train the project accountant of NEA in preparing regular financial reports and monitoring&#13;
activities. Together, they would set up a computerized accounting and budget system to pennit rapid&#13;
consolidation of project expenditures and breakdown of costs. NEA will be responsible for keeping records&#13;
and/or consolidating the accounts and preparing financial statements, disbursement applications and&#13;
records, and withdrawal applications.&#13;
4.15          Project accounts would be audited by competent independent external auditors, whose&#13;
appointment would be a condition of credit effectiveness. Audited accounts and reports would be&#13;
submnitted to IDA not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor's report on project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
expenditures would include an examination of the documentation substantiating expenditures and a&#13;
verification that: (a) project accounts permit identification of all receipts and payments; (b) goods had been&#13;
received or work performed; (c) payments had been made; (d) all expenditures had been legitimate; and (e)&#13;
the special account has been used appropriately, along with an opinion on the reliability of the SOE&#13;
procedures and on whether the goods and services acquired under the project were being utilized in&#13;
accordance with its objectives. The auditors would also prepare the "long audit report" including the&#13;
management letter revealing possible shortcomings in the staffing, accounting system and efficiency of the&#13;
internal control procedures. Assurances on the foregoing have been obtained during negotiations.&#13;
V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION. MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING&#13;
A.           General StrateEy&#13;
5.1          The general principles behind the implementation strategy of the project would be to: (a)&#13;
promote a better understanding and tackling of environmental issues by the integration of environmental&#13;
concerns in the preparation and implementation of sectoral policies and programs through the existing&#13;
structures; (b) decentralize management and make maximum use of the private sector, NGOs and local&#13;
communities in the actual execution of actions and studies, while maintaining strong coordination; (c) keep&#13;
the pace of implementation in line with capacity building and institutional development; and (d) maintain&#13;
great flexibility in the preparation of annual working plans and establish clear monitoring indicators.&#13;
B.            Proiect Imnlementation&#13;
5.2          NEA would be the implementing agency, however, the intersectoral nature of the proposed&#13;
activities would require the establishment of coordination mechanisms with different other agencies,&#13;
Ministries and NGOs. NEA would support institutional strengthening and capacity building for some of&#13;
these agencies and establish clear working relationships and links. The relationship between NEA and&#13;
MEHU would in particular be clarified and the present mandate of the Directorate of Environment would&#13;
be reviewed for consistency with its new role. MEHU's environmental role would focus on the permanent&#13;
and public tasks which derive from its responsibilities of coordinating, planning, preparing and monitoring&#13;
national policy and legislation. In this respect MEHU would have to determine the objectives and strategies&#13;
of the main environmental policies, the regulatory standards, and the enforcement rules. MEHU would&#13;
delegate implementation and monitoring of the environmental policy to NEA which would seek the&#13;
competencies and support of external services, local governments (to be entrusted soon with an official&#13;
status), NGOs, and the private sector. The Environmental Code provides the agency with the legal&#13;
authority and stature to carry out its mandate as a permanent national structure, hence fostering&#13;
institutional sustainability. Annex 3 indicates the matrix of distribution of environmental management&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
5.3          NEA's functions would foster the establishment of working groups and the development of&#13;
relationships at the technical level through the organization of workshops and meetings with the concerned&#13;
structures and implementing agencies. The main tasks that would require strong intersectoral coordination&#13;
and consultation with the Administration and the civil society and that would represent the catalytic&#13;
elements for a capacity building effort are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(a)  the implementation of an Environmental Assessment policy including the coordination and&#13;
the preparation of standard guidelines and procedures for the different sectors and type of&#13;
investments. This activity would be supported by the new regulatory framework defining the&#13;
general requirements and conditions for the preparation of EAs and the enforcement policy.&#13;
Strong technical coordination would be required with the concerned Ministries and&#13;
implementing agencies in this process of consensus building.&#13;
(b)  the preparation and coordination of Contingency Plans and Quality Control including the&#13;
definition of the underlying procedures and designation of responsibilities for their&#13;
implementation (para.3.11). This activity would be carried out in close coordination with the&#13;
previous one and would also include the definition and monitoring of norms and quality&#13;
standards for a number of activities which would deserve closer environmental analysis and&#13;
surveillance (drinking water quality control, waste disposal, industrial emission, water&#13;
emission from hydro-electric plants, pollution and other nuisances, etc..)&#13;
(c)  the establishment of an Environmental Information and Monitoring System  and the&#13;
development of a network of data exchange and communication . This would require to build&#13;
upon existing agencies (para.3.12), upgrade their data bases, strengthen their data collection&#13;
and analytical capacities, advise on standards to ensure consistency, and coordinate the&#13;
establishment of a common architecture for effective and full knowledge and use of available&#13;
information. This task would also include monitoring and evaluation of the environmental&#13;
indicators and of the Agency's activities.&#13;
(d)  the promotion of an Environmental Education, Information and Communication (EIC)&#13;
program through the appropriate structures, the organization of specific workshops and the&#13;
coordination of a training program for NEA's technical staff and for various other&#13;
Ministries, media, NGOs and interest groups on environmental issues and environmental&#13;
impact assessments. Preparation of pedagogic material and teachers' guides for the&#13;
integration of environmental concerns into education programs would be implemented under&#13;
the responsibility of the Ministry of Education through INFRE. Implementation of awareness&#13;
raising campaigns and the organization of specific workshops would be contracted to NGOs,&#13;
the University, and the environmental desk.&#13;
(e) strengthening and improving participation of the civil society in the decision making&#13;
process with focus on support for decentralized environmental planning and action-oriented&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
(f)  updating the NEAP, monitoring its implementation, coordinating environmental activities&#13;
and helping prepare policy papers and action plans on environmental-related subjects as part&#13;
of a permanent planning process.&#13;
NEA would not conduct studies or Environmental Assessments itself, nor would it build up data bases or&#13;
implement specific actions. It would rather contract these activities out and ensure that the correct&#13;
screening, statutory review and enforcement is carried out, analyze the results and submit its&#13;
recommendations to the political level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
5.4.          An Implementation Manual has been prepared by the Government with IDA support and&#13;
discussed during negotiations. It defines the various procedures for project implementation (procurement,&#13;
disbursement, audits), organizational and management arrangements, the monitoring indicators against&#13;
which to gauge project's achievements and impact, contractual arrangements, terms of reference, tentative&#13;
work schedules for the different NEA's functions, planning for consultants recruitment and for the training&#13;
program. The final adoption of an Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA would be a condition of&#13;
Credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.5          NEA would be staffed with about eight professionals for the following positions: director,&#13;
environmental education and commnunication, workshops and training, information and monitoring systems,&#13;
environmental impact assessment and studies, contingency plans and quality control, environmental&#13;
planning and NEAP monitoring, NGOs and local government promotion. Support and administrative staff&#13;
would include one procurement officer, one monitoring assistant, one financial controller, one accountant,&#13;
one administrative assistant, two secretaries. Staff could be from the public sector, seconded or hired on the&#13;
private market.&#13;
5.6          In February 1995 the Government has taken a new decree redefining the mandate of the&#13;
Directorate of Environment, has created NEA, and has appointed its Director. The rest of the staff of the&#13;
Agency should be appointed as a condition of Credit effectiveness according to terms of reference and&#13;
profiles defined in the Implementation Manual. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that&#13;
competent staff with qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA&#13;
would be appointed and maintained. NEA would establish twinning arrangements with a similar agency or&#13;
NGO and would look for technical assistance and partnership with an external firm, to be selected through&#13;
a short list, for short term periodic technical and managerial support. Therefore, no expatriate resident&#13;
technical assistance would be financed under this project, but only short term specific support according to&#13;
a work plan to be prepared and approved yearly (a tentative planning for technical support is provided in&#13;
Annex 4). To the extent possible, the use of national consultants would be encouraged. The external&#13;
support firm, refered to above, should be selected as a condition of Credit effectiveness. Preference would&#13;
be given, in the selection, to the establishment of joint-venture mechanisms with local firms for more&#13;
sustainable development of capacity building efforts.&#13;
D.            Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
5.7           NEA would be responsible for monitoring proper implementation of capacity building&#13;
activities and achievement of project objectives. Monitoring indicators and a computerized implementation&#13;
schedule would be established for the main functions of NEA and will be included in the Implementation&#13;
Manual (see Table of Contents in Annex 11). The same system would be used by NEA to plan its&#13;
operations and measure performance, achievements and effectiveness of activities. NEA's monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system would cover: (a) NEA's inputs and processing time in terms of staffing, procurement, use&#13;
of technical assistance and consultants, workshops, etc..; (b) NEA's outputs in terms of preparation and&#13;
implementation of strategies, guidelines, procedures, mandatory reviews, contingency plans, training,&#13;
awareness campaign, studies, monitoring activities; and (c) the impact on environmental management&#13;
capacity, education and awareness, enforcement of legislation, limitation of harmful activities, policy&#13;
implementation, preparedness to emergency situations, monitoring and intervention capacity (see Annex 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
E.           Reporting and Supervision&#13;
5.8          Rzrting. NEA would prepare progress reports, in a form acceptable to IDA, twice a&#13;
year. Both reports should be submitted to the Government and IDA within three months after the end of the&#13;
period to be covered: September 30 (in succinct form) and March 31 (full report). The annual full report&#13;
would include the financial statements, the review of procurement activities and the status of&#13;
implementation. It would in particular indicate progress in the implementation of environmental&#13;
assessments, enforcement of the regulatory framework, functioning of the environmental information&#13;
systern and training. NEA's annual report would be discussed by the Steering Committee for guidance and&#13;
recommendations, and once approved would be made public to facilitate access by the society to&#13;
environmental information. The annual work program would be presented by December 31 of each year&#13;
and would comprise the previsional budget requirement (including counterpart funds) and the training plan.&#13;
Assurances in this respect would be sought during negotiations of the credit. A project completion report&#13;
would be prepared by the Government and IDA within six months after the credit closing date. Assurances&#13;
in this respect were obtained during negotiations. NEA would also be responsible for preparing and&#13;
publishing annually (from PY2) an Environmental Status report, containing all relevant information on the&#13;
status and evolution of selected environmental monitoring indicators.&#13;
5.9          Supervision. Close coordination with the donor commnunity would be sought throughout&#13;
supervision so to harmonize approaches and monitor the status of NEAP implementation. A joint mid-term&#13;
review would be carried out at the latest two years after the credit becomes effective by the Governnent&#13;
and IDA on the basis of a preliminary Government mid-term progress report. Its recommendations, once&#13;
approved by the Government and IDA would be implemented as soon as possible. The review would cover&#13;
inter alia: (a) NEA's performance, functioning and management; (b) an assessment of the effectiveness of&#13;
the institutional set-up and coordination mechanisms; (c) progress made in the implementation of project&#13;
activities and particularly the environmental impact assessment policy; (d) financing of new studies and&#13;
programs identified dacring the course of the project. Assurances in this respect were obtained at&#13;
negotiations. The project supervision schedule is in Annex 9.&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.           Justification and Benefits&#13;
6.1          The projects derives from the considerable strategic effort undertaken by the Government&#13;
in recent years. Adoption of the NEAP in June 1993 represents a major step in defining the national&#13;
environmental policy and priorities. It also acted as the starting point of a series of regulatory/policy&#13;
measures and of initiatives aiming at its implementation. The project would allow the Government to&#13;
possess an effective and indispensable tool to develop a national environmental management capacity&#13;
required to effectively implement and monitor the priority actions identified in the NEAP. By dovetailing&#13;
with on-going activities it would reinforce the environmental perspective of sectoral strategies and&#13;
strengthen institutions in their ability to implement programs and enforce legislation.&#13;
6.2          The thrust of the project would be to initiate a process of changes in the way people deal,&#13;
understand and go about environmental issues. It would raise the level of environmental awareness of large&#13;
segments of the populations through actions across a large spectrum such as the improvement of existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
education, literacy and agricultural extension programs or through targeted training and workshops for&#13;
important interest groups (public officials, media, women's groups, NGOs, etc..). The project would&#13;
therefore reinforce the national capacity to identify and tackle environmental constraints and favor the&#13;
participation of the civil society in a comprehensive education, training, communication effort.&#13;
6.3           Poverty alleviation. Implementation of this project would provide an opportunity to pursue&#13;
economic development which is consistent with and depends on protecting the environment and hence&#13;
safeguarding people's welfare. By helping development become more sustainable, the project would&#13;
contribute to alleviate poverty. As illustrated in the Poverty Assessment for Benin, poverty is closely linked&#13;
to the environment in which people live and it determines their behavior in different ways: i) poor people&#13;
tend to live in poor environments, ii) poor people do not have the incentives or the opportunities to make&#13;
appropriate uses of their natural resource capital, iii) poor environments force people into further&#13;
deteriorating actions, thus creating more poverty. The project would contribute to tackling this vicious&#13;
circle, which is one of the major issues facing Benin in the years ahead.&#13;
B.           Environmental Impact&#13;
6.4           This project would be the main vehicle to develop an environmental capacity to address&#13;
and monitor the most important environmental issues in the country. It will underwrite establishment of a&#13;
national Environmental Assessment capacity. It would also have a beneficial environmental impact by&#13;
contributing to a better awareness by the population of the necessity to preserve and manage the&#13;
environment as the basis for sustainable development. The environmental category of this project is C.&#13;
C.            Impact on the State Bud2et&#13;
6.5           The annual cost of environmental degradation to the national economy (Annex 1) has been&#13;
estimated to be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent of GDP or about 15 to 26 billion FCFA. This&#13;
provides an indicative order of magnitude against which benefits, costs and impact on the State recurrent&#13;
budget could be assessed. Although investments in environment are not expected to yield immediate&#13;
returns, time has come for concern about the future generations. By putting in place a legal and&#13;
institutional framework for improved environmental management the Government would implement the&#13;
initial necessary steps to effectively tackle the degradation process, which would result in public savings in&#13;
the medium and long term. NEA, as a public body, would need some recurrent costs allocations from the&#13;
national budget as IDA support is progressively phased out. However, given its modest size and also the&#13;
possibility to receive other donor support and donations, it would involve only a marginal increase. An&#13;
estimated FCFA 70 million per year would be required during the project period as counterpart funds. An&#13;
estimated annual amount of about FCFA 120 million would be required to sustain the process after the&#13;
project is over.&#13;
D.            Risks&#13;
6.6           The major risks would stem from the difficulty to coordinate and manage long-reach&#13;
intersectoral activities and to agree on a sustainable institutional set-up which would minimize dissensions&#13;
and facilitate implementation. However, the proposed approach to strengthen the intersectoral monitoring&#13;
and coordination functions through a small but effective environmental management agency, while&#13;
streamlining and clarifying present environmental responsibilities, and supporting existing structures and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
the private sector in the implementation of sectoral programs, should avoid institutional conflicts and ease&#13;
management. Although the impact on the national budget for the functioning of such agency would be&#13;
minimal, political support and regular budget allocations would be essential to sustain implementation of&#13;
the environmental agenda. Another risk derives from the shortage of qualified local personnel with&#13;
background and experience on environmental problems and solutions. To mitigate this risk an important&#13;
education and training effort would be undertaken.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1          Prior to negotiations the Government has submitted the following documents to IDA:&#13;
(a) a draft Implementation Manual;&#13;
(b) a decree creating NEA;&#13;
(c) a decree redefining the mandate of the Directorate of Environment, within MEHU;&#13;
(d) a decree appointing NEA's Director.&#13;
7.2.         During negotiations, the Government has assured that:&#13;
(a) project accounts would be audited each year by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA&#13;
and their reports submitted to IDA for review, at the latest in the six months following the&#13;
close of the fiscal year (para. 4.15);&#13;
(b) competent staff with qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be appointed and maintained (para. 5.5 and 5.6);&#13;
(c) NEA would prepare semi-annual progress reports, in a form acceptable to IDA, to be&#13;
submitted by September 30 (in succinct form) and by March 31 (full report) of each year.&#13;
Once discussed and approved by the Steering Committee the annual full report would be&#13;
made public. The annual work program would be presented by December 31 of each year&#13;
and would comprise the previsional budget requirements (including counterpart funds) and&#13;
the training plan. A project completion report would also have to be completed within six&#13;
months after credit closing (para. 5.8); and&#13;
(d) a mid-term review would be undertaken at the latest three years after the effectiveness of&#13;
the credit, and its conclusions approved by the Government and IDA would be&#13;
implemented as soon as possible thereafter. (para. 5.9).&#13;
7.3.         Prior to Board presentation the Government has approved the new environmental code&#13;
and has transmitted it to the Parliament for adoption (para. 3.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
7.4.         Conditions of credit effectiveness are as follows:&#13;
(a) the deposit of FCFA 30 million, as initial deposit of the Government contribution to&#13;
project financing (para.4.13).&#13;
(b) the conclusion of a contract with an internationally known firm for the introduction of a&#13;
computerized accounting management and monitoring system and related training (para.&#13;
4.14);&#13;
(c) the selection of competent independent external auditors (para. 4.15);&#13;
(d) the adoption by the Government of an Implementation Manual satisfactory to IDA (para.&#13;
5.4);&#13;
(e) the selection of NEA's competent staff with qualifications, experience, terms and&#13;
conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA as defined in the Implementation Manual&#13;
(para. 5.5 and 5.6); and&#13;
(f) the selection of an external firm, acceptable to IDA, to provide for short term technical and&#13;
managerial periodic support of NEA (para. 5.6).&#13;
7.5.         Recommendations. Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be eligible for an IDA credit of SDR 5.5 million (US$8.0 million equivalent) to the Republic of&#13;
Benin.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BENIN&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Key Features and Overall Program Objectives of the NEAP&#13;
A.           Introduction&#13;
1.           The Agenda 21, which reflects the outcome of the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992,&#13;
calls for States to prepare "country driven" sustainable development strategies that prioritize&#13;
environmental issues and identify their underlying causes. Although the NEAP preparation process&#13;
in Benin had started before the Summit, its final report, adopted in June 1993, has been considered&#13;
by the Government as the most appropriate and advanced vehicle to respond to that international&#13;
commnitment and to address sustainable development issues. Monitoring of the NEAP and its&#13;
regular updating would be part of the responsibility of the Government so to be in line with the&#13;
Agenda 21 requirements. The NEAP was prepared by a Preparation Unit, staffed with national&#13;
experts and consultants under the "tutelle" of an Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committee chaired&#13;
by the Ministry of Environment. Its relative autonomy has helped the Unit to focus on the task to&#13;
be performed and served as key element to permit broader consultation and involvement of the civil&#13;
society, and the development of new partnerships. In the same time the strong commitment and&#13;
overview by the Ministry of Environment has permitted the NEAP to maintain political clout. The&#13;
preparation process stands as a model of participatory approach which has to a large extent been&#13;
made possible and promoted by the new democratic environment which is being built in Benin&#13;
since 1990/91.&#13;
B.           The Preparation Process&#13;
2.           Different consultative and analytical tools have been used during the preparation&#13;
process:&#13;
a)   The regional workshops have represented the principal vehicle of extensive&#13;
consultation with the different segments of the population, the implementing agencies&#13;
and the beneficiaries, on what "environment" means for them, what the problems to be&#13;
solved are and why, and on the proposed local solutions. Five workshops were carried&#13;
out, of which four in the main Regions of the country and one in Cotonou specifically&#13;
for the urban aspects. Attendance was mainly represented by the beneficiaries or the&#13;
people directly affected by environmental degradation, NGOs, the private sector and&#13;
the administration. The workshops have been carried out in French and in the local&#13;
language.&#13;
b)   Village and urban surveys were carried out to complete, refine and test the information&#13;
collected during the workshop. Some specific groups were also interviewed which may&#13;
have been under-represented or could not express themselves properly during the&#13;
workshops.&#13;
c)   A documentary research was carried out and a data base was set up containing&#13;
relevant summary information on existing documents, reports, and projects covering&#13;
environmental subjects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -                            Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
d)   The inventory of the regulatory and legislative acts and codes with an environmental&#13;
content has permitted to assess the scope of the environmental legislation in Benin and&#13;
its evolution over time. It also allowed to consolidate and rationalize the different&#13;
scattered pieces of infornation and present a synoptic view that would foster the&#13;
preparation of an environmental code embodying the different relevant legal texts.&#13;
e)   Five thematic groups have been put in place in order to carry out diagnostic and&#13;
analytical studies on the following topics: i) environmental planning and economy, ii)&#13;
institutional and legislative framework, iii) management of the urban and rural&#13;
environment, iv) environmental information and monitoring systems, v) environmental&#13;
education, training and communication. Each group was constituted by a core of two&#13;
national consultants with the possibility to request for additional expertise as required.&#13;
These groups and the preparation Unit were regularly consulting with the NGOs&#13;
community, the Administration and the donors.&#13;
f)   The national workshop has been a fundamental milestone in the preparation process. It&#13;
has permitted to present the first results of the regional workshops and of the thematic&#13;
groups to a forum of representatives of the various segments of the population,&#13;
Government and private sector. A draft environmental strategy was also proposed. The&#13;
feed-back received permitted to complete the thematic studies, finalize the strategy&#13;
document, and initiate preparation of the action Plan.&#13;
g)   Pilot activities were also initiated during the NEAP preparation to test a number of&#13;
actions that may deserve attention and further extension. They also permitted to&#13;
provide a touch of realism and the opportunity to show some concrete undertakings to&#13;
the public in the following areas: i) compost preparation by the vegetable producers of&#13;
Cotonou, ii) waste disposal, iii) Journalist training, iv) preparation of an environmental&#13;
lexicon in national languages, v) creation and support to an environmental desk&#13;
composed of national journalists, etc..&#13;
h)   During the final national seminar, the environmental strategy and action plan was&#13;
presented to the public and endorsed. The final report was subsequently adopted by the&#13;
Ministers Council.&#13;
i)  "Feed-back workshops" were subsequently organized in every Region to convey the&#13;
outcome of the preparation process and the conclusions of the NEAP.&#13;
C.           The Cost of Environmental Degradation&#13;
3            A study on the economic impact of environmental degradation was undertaken as&#13;
part of the NEAP preparation and suggests that a conservative estimate of the annual cost of&#13;
environmental degradation could be in the range of 3% to 5% of GDP or about 15 to 26 billion&#13;
CFAF. These figures should be used with caution given the weak data base existing in Benin and&#13;
the difficulty of carrying out an effective cost/benefit analysis of environmental degradation in the&#13;
absence of well established shadow prices for the different resources. The environment is mostly&#13;
considered as a public good, with no costs related to its exploitation while benefits are entirely&#13;
appropriated by the users. Gratuity, deriving from open access to natural resources, encourages&#13;
over exploitation and low labor productivity, while the related cost will be suffered by the society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -                             Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
Many of the environmental resources considered are not tradable, hence in the absence of a market&#13;
price and national accounting procedures, different methods have been developed to assess the&#13;
replacement cost or opportunity cost of the degradation of the national resource capital. These&#13;
methods are all subject to some degree of controversy and arbitration, particularly in view of the&#13;
difficulty to estimate the real social cost to the economy of environmental degradation. However, in&#13;
spite of being only indicative, these estimates are essential for the decision maker to understand the&#13;
issues at stake and permit their better integration in economic planning and allocation of national&#13;
resources.&#13;
4.           In Benin, the estimated cost deriving from forest destruction, soil erosion and&#13;
losses of soil fertility, which are very much interrelated, accounts for the bulk of the total cost or&#13;
about 70%. This seems to confirm that agriculture production has mainly been the result of a&#13;
"mining" activity, and that part of past growth may have been achieved mainly through depletion of&#13;
the national capital. Pollution, mainly deriving from urban growth and partly from industrial&#13;
sources (cement factories), has direct effects on human health. Water pollution and poor sanitation&#13;
are directly responsible for the increasing cases of diarrhea, dysentery, malaria and cholera. For the&#13;
latter, about 7,000 cases (of which 260 fatalities) were reported in 1991. Overall, about 400.000&#13;
cases of illness were related to the poor quality of the environment. The cost of treatment and the&#13;
losses incurred by the national economy in terms of people's absence from productive activities&#13;
represent an estimated amount of about 3 billion CFAF per year or 14% of the total. Important&#13;
economic losses due to flooding occur regularly in urban and rural areas with considerable&#13;
damages to dwellings, roads (especially in rural areas), and agricultural production for an&#13;
estimated annual cost of about 2 billion CFAF (10%). The decline of fish resources can also be&#13;
attributed to some extent to environmental degradation and the value of this loss has been estimated&#13;
to be about 600 million CFAF. Finally, although it represent a threat to the national heritage and to&#13;
tourism development, the cost of biodiversity degradation and fauna depletion has not been&#13;
calculated, due to lack of data.&#13;
D.            Overall Program Objectives and Proposed Components&#13;
5.            To address the three overall objectives of a) promoting a behavioral change&#13;
towards the environment and a greater sensitization of the whole population; b) develop a national&#13;
environmental management and monitoring capacity; and c) improve the standards of life of the&#13;
population; the NEAP proposes to develop and implement the following priority programs:&#13;
1. Education, Training and Communication&#13;
* Integration of the environment in the education system&#13;
* Training of trainers and of the education hierarchy&#13;
* Training of a critical mass of environmental specialists&#13;
* Sensitization of political, traditional and religious authorities&#13;
* National communication campaigns in local languages&#13;
* Support for the local media&#13;
2. The institutional and regulatoryframework, environmental management and monitoring&#13;
* Creation of a technical structure for environmental management and monitoring&#13;
* Preparation and extension of an adequate environmental legislation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

* Construction and maintenance of rural roads&#13;
* Public works and rural infrastructure&#13;
* Elaboration and implementation of a land tenure policy&#13;
* Promotion of secondary and tertiary activities&#13;
* Support agricultural production, storage and processing&#13;
5. Research and Action on land management and rural resources&#13;
* Communal/village land management&#13;

* Establishment of a biodiversity monitoring system&#13;
* Conservation and management of protected areas, natural forests and other ecosystems&#13;
* Wildlife management and game ranching&#13;
* Creation and management of botanical gardens&#13;
7. Water resources management&#13;
* Assessment of water resources situation&#13;
* Elaboration of a water conservation and management Master Plan&#13;
* Implementation of the Master Plan&#13;
E.           Status of Implementation&#13;
6.           Some of these programs have already started or are under preparation and the&#13;
proposed strategy is to build on those and many other activities to avoid redundancy, overlapping&#13;
&#13;

of responsibility and waste of resources. As implementation of these programs evolves it will be&#13;
important to assess progress, review priorities and update required actions as part of a permanent&#13;
environmental planning process. Among these, the most important initiatives related to the&#13;
environment are:&#13;
a) the Natural Resources Management project (NRMP), financed by IDA, CFD, GTZ&#13;
and UNDP, promotes sustainable production systems and natural resources management&#13;
by organized rural communities on wildlife, natural forests and watershed pilot sites. It&#13;
implements land tenure pilot operations. It also aims at strengthening the natural&#13;
resources planning and environmental monitoring capacity and reviewing the forestry&#13;
and bio-diversity policies and regulatory framework;&#13;
b) the Urban Rehabilitation and Management project financed by IDA and France aims&#13;
at improving the urban infrastructure of Cotonou and Porto Novo through labor&#13;
intensive works and better planning and management of urban growth. It also&#13;
implements a solid waste disposal and management scheme and the preparation of plans&#13;
to protect the ground water fields from human settlement and pollution;&#13;
c) the Fuelwood Plantation project, financed by ADB/OPEC/WFP has embarked in the&#13;
plantation of fast growing trees for the fuelwood demand of Cotonou and Porto Novo;&#13;
d) the Lagoon Fisheries Development project, financed by GTZ, implements&#13;
conservation and management techniques in the lagoon of Cotonou;&#13;
e) the Multipurpose Tree Plantations project, financed by UNSO, promotes the use of&#13;
species of commercial, ecological, agricultural value;&#13;
f) technical assistance is being provided to MEHU by GTZ;&#13;
g) a National Parks and biodiversity conservation and management project is being&#13;
prepared for possible GEF financing and would support better protection of the national&#13;
heritage of biodiversity in the national parks and hunting areas with the participation and&#13;
development of the surrounding communities;&#13;
h) the Rural Water project (to start in 1995), financed by IDA and DANIDA, aims at&#13;
maximizing the impact and sustainability of water services and supply in rural areas;&#13;
i) the Population and Health Sector project (under preparation) would support the&#13;
adoption and implementation of a national population policy and develop better delivery&#13;
of community-based health services.&#13;
Numerous smaller projects and operations are being carried out through NGOs and Associations.&#13;

The Monitorin2 System&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    A monitoring system will be set up within the environmental information unit of NEA. The&#13;
system will enable to monitor the planning and implementation of project activities and measure the&#13;
discrepancies between the initial design and the actual realizations of the project. This monitoring&#13;
system will be set-up before start-up of the project and will require a three months consultancy for&#13;
the initial design and training. This would include the setting-up of a computerized implementation&#13;
schedule and the definition of monitoring indicators to be included in the final version of the&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
Elements of the Monitorine System&#13;
2.    The Inputs and the Resources. These aspects would be addressed by the financial and&#13;
disbursement monitoring system to be established separately. It would mainly deal with the use of&#13;
resources and procurement activities required for the implementation of the project. This would&#13;
include equipment, goods and consultant services. The main indicators to be monitored in this&#13;
respect are the availability of the inputs with respect to used resources and the standard&#13;
procurement processing time (see Annex 6) which would provide an indicator of the performance&#13;
of the system. Planning and monitoring of input and resources use would be particularly important&#13;
since procurement decisions will Cetermine the proper and timely project implementation. This&#13;
monitoring systems would need to be compatible with the project activities monitoring system so to&#13;
be able to exchange information and enhance the performance of the system. Off-the-shelve&#13;
technology seems more appropriate for that purpose by making use of compatible Data Base&#13;
Management Systems (DBMS) and Project planning and monitoring softwa-e.&#13;
3.    The Outputs. The first step of the planning exercise consists of identifying separate tasks&#13;
that would be hierarchically codified and implemented over a period of time (see implementation&#13;
schedule above). Some of these tasks may be stretching over a limited and well defined period of&#13;
time, some others may represent the core of a particular function which is permanent. In many&#13;
cases the former will lead to the latter. The project will actually help initiate those permanent&#13;
functions that constitute the basis of an environmental management capacity.&#13;
(a)    Defined tasks can often be measured by the relevant status indicator which&#13;
consists in ascertaining, with respect to the initial planning, whether the task has&#13;
started, is on-going and achieved to a given percentage, is accomplished, or is late.&#13;
PERT or CPM methods enable a simple management and monitoring of these&#13;
tasks. Status indicators can also be used as output indicators in cases where the&#13;
task has to deliver a specific output such as: preparation of a report, diffusion of&#13;
education manuals, adoption of procedures, signature of decrees, workshops,&#13;
completion of training activities (see Annex 4), etc... A special attribute (flag)&#13;
would be used to indicate that a task must provide an output.&#13;
(b)    Permanent tasks would constitute the core of NEA's mandate and will last beyond&#13;
the project life. To gauge progress towards the achievement of project objectives it&#13;
would be important to assess NEA capacity to successfully implement the project&#13;
through performance indicators associated to the different tasks or functions it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                            Annex 5&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
carries out such as: implementation and monitoring of the Environmental&#13;
Assessment policy, monitoring compliance to standards, quality control, assistance&#13;
in the preparation and implementation of contingency plans, environmental&#13;
planning and monitoring, etc.. (see the implementation schedule above).&#13;
Discrepancies between expectations and actual achievements would need to be&#13;
analyzed to justify the reasons for the delay, the inefficiency or whether the target&#13;
was unrealistic.&#13;
4.     The Impact. This element would refer to the impact on the environment as a consequence&#13;
of project activities or in general terms as part of the environmental monitoring function for&#13;
selected global indicators.&#13;
(a)    Project impact. The major indicators that would be used to assess project impact&#13;
would be in terms of&#13;
*  change in behavior or enhanced knowledge of the targeted groups that benefited&#13;
from the education, information, communication and training program. Surveys&#13;
would be conducted on a representative sample of the people trained or educated to&#13;
assess the degree of intemalization and usefulness of the program.&#13;
e  expanded availability and usefulness of environmental information. This would be&#13;
measured by the capacity of the environmental information network to generate&#13;
new relevant products and by the increased number of users;&#13;
*  better integration of environmental consideration in sectoral policies. Working&#13;
groups recommendations and the annual Environmental Status Report would&#13;
report on the necessity to realign sectoral policies and programs.&#13;
*  effectiveness of a set of procedures and mechanisms to implement an&#13;
environmental regulatory framework (assessment policy, quality control, norms&#13;
and standards, contingency plans) aimed at preventing, minimizing, mitigating or&#13;
compensating for possible adverse environmental impacts. This would mainly&#13;
translate in terms of avoidance of costs, risks and nuisance due to unanticipated&#13;
environmental problems. Given the difficulty to forecast or plan possible&#13;
constraints or harmful situations, indicators would focus on the performance of&#13;
NEA in ensuring and monitoring compliance to the procedures, Government&#13;
capacity to enforce legislation, preparedness to emergency situations, etc.. In this&#13;
respect, impact indicators and performance indicators (see above) would be alike.&#13;
(b)    Environmental monitoring indicators. The Environmental Information System&#13;
(EIS) Component of the project will define and measure selected global&#13;
Environmental indicators that are relevant for Benin such as: water quality,&#13;
pollution sources, evolution of the biomass, coastal erosion, forest cover,&#13;
biodiversity. The definitive list of indicators and responsibilities for the gathering&#13;
and computation will be defined upon the beginning of the project. The first report&#13;
on the Environment that will group these indicators is planned for PY2 and&#13;
scheduled to be annual. The system that will be used for managing these indicators&#13;
will be similar to the one used to manage the quantitative indicators of the&#13;
monitoring system. In addition the Environmental monitoring indicators would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
have a spatial component. The same rules for codification will be applied to this&#13;
system so to enable a linkage with a Geographic Information System. Although&#13;
these indicators would be important to monitor, their evolution would not be&#13;
directly related to the performance of NEA in carrying out the project.&#13;
Codification of the different elements&#13;
5.    Each element of the system can be viewed as a table that describes all its characteristics.&#13;
The system will consist of three tables: the input, the tasks and the indicators. They will need to be&#13;
codified in order to manage the relationship among each other, and to define the expected indicator&#13;
and timing. This codification will be extended to the other NEA's functions in order to enable the&#13;
relationship with the other information systems (accounting system and GIS for environmental&#13;
monitoring indicators).&#13;
Technical asDects&#13;
6.    The system should permit easy updating and modification of the planning and of the initial&#13;
objectives. It should be set-up in an open-ended way so to be able to exchange data with other&#13;
system such as the accounting system and spreadsheets type of software. When possible, reading&#13;
data directly in the original format would be preferred to using import/export facilities. The project&#13;
monitoring system could be used by the client but also by the Bank. In addition to regular&#13;
reporting, data would be exchanged so to get relevant information and facilitate supervision&#13;
missions. The data may be sent through magnetic support or through the Intemet network after the&#13;
installation of a server in Benin. Using commercial software packages would ensure conviviality,&#13;
economy, possibility of updating and communication with other users. Software packages should&#13;
be on a Data Base Management System (DBMS). For planning, use of resources and monitoring&#13;
status indicators, a Microsoft Project type of software would be appropriate. For monitoring of&#13;
perfomiance indicators a Microsoft Access type of software could be used. It is also possible to&#13;
provide the monitoring system with a set of filters that will flag the major discrepancies and delays&#13;
in the implementation and performance of the project and focus attention on specific topics.&#13;

            Over the period of four years the
            Environmental Management Project will support the
            development of a national environmental management capacity
            and help the Government implement the National Environmental
            Action Plan adopted June 1993. It will in particular pursue
            capacity building and institutional support, including
            streamlining and strengthening of national environmental
            responsibilities, reinforcing policy implementation and
            coordination mechanisms, promoting better preparation and
            enforcement of the environmental regulatory framework,
            developing an effective information system and monitoring
            and evaluation capacity. The project will also promote
            public awareness of environmental issues and the integration
            of environmental considerations in the education system. To
            achieve these objectives, the project will finance
            investments designed to: (a) improve the national
            environmental management capacity; and (b) improve the
            general level of awareness on environmental issues.
