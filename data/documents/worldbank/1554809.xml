ALSTRACT&#13;
Despite the importar.ce of agriculture to the national economy&#13;
of lPakistan and the major role played oy the government in its&#13;
development, a number cf k.oy izsues have not been adequately&#13;
addressed by existing stu ic-.   This paper provides an empirical&#13;
basis for discussion of changes in the agricultural terms of trade,&#13;
growth of agricultural productivity and Incomes, priein7 of&#13;
a6rxcultsural inputs and outputs, and subsidizatimn and taxation of&#13;
agricultur,&#13;
The paper notes that the terms of trade between agriculture and&#13;
the other sectors have not eignificantly deteiiorated during che&#13;
period 1960-83.   Indeed, in absolute terms, farmers' purchasir3 power&#13;
vhether zeasured in terms of the quantity of output or per unit of&#13;
productive effort, has actually Improved, even if gradually.     Hence,&#13;
the farmers' ability to pay for agricultural inputs, d._pite gradual&#13;
increas.J in their prices, did not erode over the years.&#13;
Net returns to farmers have increased, until recently, because&#13;
of increases in crop prices and because of substantial government&#13;
subsidies for inputs. The recent sharp increaseu in fertilizer&#13;
prices have reversed this trend, but they should not affect the&#13;
continued profitability in the -,se of fertilizer even at higher&#13;
prices. Similarly, despite increases over the past fou- years, water&#13;
charges remain a small proportion of total production costs and are&#13;
in any cese, subptantially less than the estimated scarcity value of&#13;
irrigation w'ater co the farmer.&#13;
Until 1977, agricultuP zs,,ILrJbiated more in taxes to the&#13;
economy than It t-&amp;k out throtigh financial subnidies, but the&#13;
position has reversed since then.    Tiere has been a decline in nt-&#13;
aubsl6ies, particularly after I98i, mainly because of reduction in&#13;
fertilizer subsidies. With the government committed to eliminate&#13;
fertilizer subsidies by 1985, this trend is expected to continue.&#13;
Movever, the economic taxation of wheat and ba.mati rice (as a reault&#13;
of setting domestic prices belov their tnternational levels) in&#13;
cootrast to the economic subsidies provided to sugar (to offset&#13;
higher domestic prices relative to imports) should be a matter of&#13;
concern. The paper argues thit appropriate price policies that are&#13;
responsive to '-hanges in irternational ;rices are likely to hase as&#13;
salutary an effect as any at:empt to reduce financial subsidies or to&#13;
increase taxes.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Pese a la importancia de la agricultura para la economia de Pakistin&#13;
y la gran influencia del Gobierno en el desarrollo del sector agropecua-&#13;
rio, hay varios aspectos furidamentales que no han sido abordrdods debida-&#13;
mente en lrs estudios que se han realizado. LELc tr-abajo proporciona una&#13;
base empirica para examinar las variaciones en la rilaci6n de intercambio&#13;
de este sector, cl aumento de la productividad y los ingresos agricolas,&#13;
los precios de los .nsumos y prodluctos agricolas, y la subvenci6n y tribu-&#13;
taci6n de la ag:ricultura.&#13;
En el trabajo se obscrva que la relaci6n de intercambio entre la&#13;
agrIculzur4 y los demas sectores no se deterioro en medida significativa&#13;
durante el periodo de 1960-83. En realidad, en terminos absolutos, el&#13;
poder adquisitivo de los agricultores --medido en funci6n de la cantidad&#13;
de producto o del costo de :os insumos-- ha mejorado, aunqu3 gradual-&#13;
me-nte. Por consiguiente. la capacidad de los agricultcres para comprar&#13;
insumos agricolas no ha disminuido con el tiempo, pese el aumento gradual&#13;
de sus precios.&#13;
llasta hace poc:o, los ingresos netos die los agricultores aumentaron,&#13;
debido a incrementos de los precios de los cultivos y a las considerables&#13;
subvenciones gubernamentales a los insumos. Esta tendencia so ha inver-&#13;
tido a causa de los pronuncisdos aumentos recientes de los precios de los&#13;
fertilizantes, pero esto nD deberia afectar .- la rentabilidad continua del&#13;
uso de estos, aun cuando sus preclos sean mas altos.    Asimismo, peso a los&#13;
aumentos de los ultimos cuntro anos, las tarifas que se cobian por el agua&#13;
siguen representando una proporcl6n pequenia de los costos totales de pro-&#13;
ducci6n y, en todo caso, son muy inferiores al precio en ra2.on do la esca-&#13;
sez quo, ;egun se ha estimado, tendria que pagar el agricultor por el agua&#13;
para riego.&#13;
Hasta 1977 la agricultura aport6 mas a la economia en forma de impues-&#13;
tos que lo que recibi6 de esta en forma de subvenciones financiera!, pero&#13;
la sItuaci.6n ha camb:ado desde entonces. Las st'bvenciones notas han dis-&#13;
minuldo. en par.lcular a partir de 1981, principalmente debido a la reduc-&#13;
ci6n do las otorgadas a los fertilizantes.    Se preve que esta tendencia&#13;
contInuara, pues el Gobierno esta decidido a eliminar las subvenciones a&#13;
los fertilizantes hacia 1985.   Sin embargo, la tributaci6n e-con6mica del&#13;
trigo y el arroz Basmati (coMo resultado de la fijaci6n de precios inter-&#13;
nos Inferiores a los internacionales), por oposicl6n a las subvenciones&#13;
econ6micas que se otorgan al azucar (para compensar el precio interno, quo&#13;
es mns a)to que el de importaci6n), deberia ser motivo de preocupacl6n.&#13;
En el trabajo --a aduce que unas politicas de preclos adecuadas quo respon-&#13;
dan a las variaciones de los preclos internacionales tienen las mlsmas&#13;
probabilidades de surtir efectos saludables que los inte.:tos de reducir&#13;
las .-ivenciones financieras o de aumentar los Impuestos.&#13;

M1a1gri la place que tient l'agriculture dans Vteconomie pakistaniaise&#13;
et le role que 1'Etat : , i dans son d6velop?ement, les etudes publ:cees&#13;
jusqu"a present laisses      :- l'ombre un certain nomnbre de questions cle.&#13;
Cette otude fourn't des u-..nees emplriques et examine quatre paramitres du&#13;
secteur agricole : variations des termes de lechange, croissance de la&#13;
produc.:ivite et des revenus, dtermrination des prix des intrants et ces&#13;
produi:s, et imposition et suh.entions.&#13;
11 apparait que Ies termes de l'echange enLre I'agriculture et les&#13;
autres secteurs ne so sont pas sensiblement d6grad;s au cours de la&#13;
periode 1960-83.   E,, 'iit, en cermes absolus, le pouvoir d'achat des&#13;
paysans, mesuro en foiiction de la product-on ou dui co:it des intrants,&#13;
s'est meme ameliore piM ai peu.   Bien que ies prix des facteurs de pioduc-&#13;
tion aient progressivi!rent augmente, les paysans ne sont donc pas moins a&#13;
mime de le. payer qu'-l y a quclques annees.&#13;
Jusqu'a une 6poquoe recente, les bene'fces nets des exploitants aug-&#13;
mentaient, par suite de la hauss;. des prix des r6coltes et des 'crte. sub-&#13;
ventions de I'Etat aux intrants agricoles. Cette tendance s'est renversce&#13;
a la suite de la brusque augmentation du prix des engrais, qui ne devralt&#13;
toutefois pas compromettre la rentabili:e de l'emploi des engra);. De&#13;
mime si les redevances d'eau ont ete relev6es au eou:s de. quatce der-&#13;
nieres annees, elles ne repr6sentent toujours qu'unc petite partie du cout&#13;
global de la production, et elles sont netteent. inf6rioures a In vdleur&#13;
de rarete qu'a l'eau d'irrigation pour le paysan.&#13;
Jusqu'en 1977, les imp6ts que l'Etat percevait sur l'agrlculture&#13;
etaient superieurs nux subventions qu'il lui versait. Mais la situa3Lion&#13;
s'est inversee depuis lors.    Aujourd'hui, et surtout depuls 1981, les sub-&#13;
ventions nettes sont en baisse, du fait surtout de la r6duction des sub-&#13;
ventioris aux engrais.   Les pouvoirs publics s'etant engages a 6l1mincr les&#13;
subventions aux engrais d'icl a 1985, cette tendance devrait se pour-&#13;
suivre. Cependant, la taxation economique du b1i et du riz basmati (dont&#13;
le prix sur le marche national est infe'rieur . :-ur cours sur le marche&#13;
internat:onal), compario a la subvention economique dont b6neficie Ie&#13;
sucre (du fait que son prix interieur est Iev' par rapport a celui du&#13;
sucre importe), est inquietante. Cette etude -ontre que des politiques de&#13;
prix appropriees et modulees en fonction des -ouvenents des prix interna-&#13;
tionaux peuvent avoir un effet tout aussi salutaire que toute tentative de&#13;
reduire. Ies subventions ou d'augmenter les io:s.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTTON&#13;
Agriculture remains the most important economic activity in&#13;
Pakistan, accounting for 30% of the gross domestic product (CDP). Crops&#13;
provide 69X of agricultural GDP. livestock 28%, and fishing and forestry the&#13;
.emaiuing 3%. Taxes on products of agricultural origin make up roughly 20%&#13;
of public revenue, vhile agricultural vorkers account for over 50% of the&#13;
vorkforce. Products originating in the agricultural sector figure&#13;
prominently in ?akistan's trade; :ice, cotton, yam and cloth are major&#13;
exports vhil,e edible oil and (until recently) vheat are the majinr imports.&#13;
The government plays a major role in the agricultural economy. It&#13;
sets procurerment or minimum prices for crops (wheat, rice, sugarcane, and&#13;
cotton), and fixes ;:ices for agricultural products (sugar and flour), and&#13;
for inputs (such as fertilizer and water).    Although to a dimini2hinR extent,&#13;
it participates in the processing, production, import and domestic markeLing&#13;
of agricultural crops and key inputs. Incentives to farmers have been&#13;
provided through subsidies; in fiscal year (FY) 1980, these subsidies (both&#13;
producer and consumer) awmsunted to about Rs 6,000 million, or about 28% of&#13;
che country's annual development plan. I/&#13;
Despite the importance of agriculture and the major government role,&#13;
not many studies of its impact _n incomes, and on the transfer of resources&#13;

among sectors, have emerged. jJ This appears to be partly the consequence of&#13;
paucity of data; while terms-of-trade indices between Pakistan and the rest&#13;
of the world are part of the country's official statistics, up-to-date infor-&#13;
mation on intersectoral terms of trade is less readily available. -Even so, a&#13;
number of views expressed on Pakistan's agriculture appear not to have been&#13;
based upon any analysis of existing data.    Among the'e views are that&#13;
agriculture's terms of trade have been declining cver the years, that a major&#13;
factor for the relative stagnation of agriculture is its lack of&#13;
productivity, that improvements in yields have made only marginal contribu-&#13;
tions to growth in agricultural output, and that the mobilization of resour-&#13;
ces in agriculture has been inadequate.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to provide an empirical basis for&#13;
diocussion of four- isisues.&#13;
O Changing trezdd in the terms of trade for agriculture.&#13;
O The growth of agricultural incomes and productivity.&#13;
O The prices of agricultural inputs and outputs and their relationship.&#13;
O Subsidies for, and taxation of, agriculture.&#13;
These issues are examined in the context of the government's role in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;

II. AGRICULTURE'S TERMS OF TRADE&#13;
As countries advance economically, there is a progressive decline in&#13;
the share of agriculture in SDP. In Pakistan, wvile the real value added in&#13;
agriculture increased, on the average, 2.7% per year between iY70 and FY82,&#13;
its sh.:e of the total GDP fell from 39% in FY70 to 31% in FY82.       In&#13;
contrast, the share of manufacturing (including mining) increased from 16.5%&#13;
to 17.9% during the same period.&#13;
An important measure of agriculture's position relative to other&#13;
sectors is its termis of trade (TOT), or the relationship between the prices&#13;
of goods bought and sold by farmers. There are at least two reasons why&#13;
economists are interested in agriculture's TOT.      First, it indicates whether&#13;
income is being transferred out of agriculture. Second, it signals the&#13;
strength of incentivcs to the agri-uiture sector to adopt inrnovations and to&#13;
produce more.&#13;
Fcur terms-of-trade concepts are used in this section.      The first&#13;
and most common index of TOT is the net barter teros of trsde, which is an&#13;
index of the ratio of pricPs of agricultural products to the prices of&#13;
manufactured goods. 1/ This index is estimated for FY60-FY83 in column I of&#13;
Table 1. rn the early 1950s, trade-restricting policies have turned the&#13;
terms of trade against agriculture.    From the mid-1950s to mid-19609, this&#13;

situation :is reversed on account of the sl-ver grovth of agriculture relative&#13;
to industry, bad veather and a dec.ine in the import of American vheat under&#13;
PL-480 fol;owed by a slight decline toward the end of the 1960s in the years&#13;
marked by the ouset of the "green revotution." LJ Hovever, despite some&#13;
variations shovn in column 1, a declining trend in agriculture's terms of&#13;
trade has not been observed over the past two decades.&#13;

The other three terms-of-trade indices used to determine the rela-&#13;
tive status of agriculture are:&#13;
o Wholesale price rstios. Agricultural prices relative to the&#13;
price index of manufactured goods were 'zigher in FY82 than in&#13;
FY70, the base year (see Table 2).&#13;
O Income terms r, trade. This is a measure of the purchasing power&#13;
of agriculture. As a result of the rising trend of agricultural&#13;
output, there was steady inprovenent in purchasing power (over&#13;
250% between FY60 4nk -Y82) as measured by the income TOT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o  Sirnle factorial terms of trade. i) This index re.lects the&#13;
puichasing power of agriculture per unit f productive effort.&#13;
The gradual, if erratic, increase in this index (show-n in column&#13;
6 of Table 1) is mainly the result of improvements in the produc-&#13;
tivity of inputs used during the past two decades.&#13;
The overall trends in these terms-of-trade indices indicate that in&#13;
absolute terms, farmers    purchaFing pover, whether measured in terms oj Fhe&#13;
quantity of output, or of the unit of prod-.tive effort, has increased.&#13;
Hence, farmers' ability to pay for agriculttral inputs h.s not been eroded&#13;
over tie years, a conclusion also emphasized by other studies. 2/ liowever,&#13;
br RuFe of rhe ways they are defined, these indices are not the most direct&#13;
ceasures of farmers' welfare, nor can they be used to infer whether farmers&#13;
are better off than those in the nonagricultural sector. These major issues,&#13;
however, are the subject of the rest of this paper.&#13;
1/  This is defined as the product of the net bartpr index by an index of&#13;
factor productivity. For Pakistan's agriculture, Wizarat has constructed&#13;
a total productivity index which is the ratio of an index of agricultural&#13;
value added to an aggregate index of agricultural inputs. The in?uts&#13;
considered are land, labor, and capital. The last is approximated by&#13;
number of tubewells and the livestock population. Three alternative&#13;
definitions for land--cropped area, net area sown, and cultivated area--&#13;
were used. Clearly, the usefulness of the single factorial index depends&#13;
on the validity of the productivity index. See Wizarat, S., "Technical&#13;
Change in Pakistan's Agriculture: 1953-54 to 1977-78," Research Paper&#13;

III. OUTPUT GR01Mr AND PRODUCTIVITY&#13;
Of the factors influencing the agricultural terms of trade, output&#13;
recorded hiigher growth during FY70-FY82 than in earlier decades. This growth&#13;
has often been attributed to expansion of acreages rather than to improve-&#13;
ments in yields. O1 As Table 3 shows, however, this judgment is not always&#13;
consistent with the evidence, and is, in any case, &amp;n oversimpli.ication.&#13;
Over the period lY70-FY82, growth in yields was more important in contribut-&#13;
ing to growth in output in 5 ouc o. ' yea-; for cotton, 6 out of 8 for rice,&#13;
9 out of 11 for whea:, and 3 out of 9 for sugarcane.&#13;
At the same time, the decline in yields played a dominant role in&#13;
the fall in output in 6 ytars out of 7 for cottoil, 3 out of 4 for rice, 2 out&#13;
of 2 for wheat, and 3 out of 4 for sugarcane. Even when averages aO,- taken,&#13;
the results, vary significantly among crops and time periods. For cotton and&#13;
whest, improvemento in yielde played a major rwle in increasing output&#13;
:-aidlees of the time period selected. The reversce is true for rice and&#13;
sugarcane, but in both cases, yieleD :.-oved after FY79.       Insofar as&#13;
imp:-ovementa in productivity are associated vith an in.rease in yield, the&#13;
evidence from Table ' points LO a greater role for productivity in the his-&#13;
torical growth of agricultural output thac is often admitted.&#13;

Further support for this view is provided in Table 4. VJ The data in&#13;
the Table shov that the incre!ase in the use of inputs is the major factor in&#13;
only 10 out of 17 years that the agricultural value added has increased since&#13;
FY60. Taking tho .ntire period FY60-FY81, the increase in the agricultural&#13;
input index accounted for 65% of ;he increase in output, but this share is&#13;
less than 50% if the period FY70-FY78 is excluded. (During the latter&#13;
period, output soared 1521 during the eight years.) These findings, hove?ver,&#13;
are in no way incon&gt;..A'ent with the perceptior. that the growth 'n produc-&#13;
tivity has been erratic and disappointing, that the grovth of real output per&#13;
capita has been much slover in agriculture than in other sectozs (see Annex,&#13;
Table A.3), and that considerable potential remains for improving yields.&#13;
J/ Since productivity is treated as a residual, the well-known problems&#13;
apply vhen measurement is attempted.    Under fairly restrictive&#13;
assumptions, the share of productivity change in total output grovth is&#13;
equal to ooe minus the share of increase in total inputs.     In Table 4,&#13;
no attempt haa been made to quantify productivity. The lover the share&#13;
of agricultural input in total output growth, hovever, the greater the&#13;
likelihood that productivity is important.&#13;

IV. INPUT/OUTPUT PRICES AND FARMERS' INCOKES&#13;
Wbile output and income terms of trade are important measures of&#13;
agricultural performance, farmers' net incomes are a more appropriate measure&#13;
of their velfare. The data in Table 5 shov that net returno of average&#13;
farmers in Pakistan rose for all major crops during the last decade;&#13;
increases for leading farmers in the Punjab were even higher.&#13;
The data also shov that in the Punjab, Basmati, the finer-quality&#13;
and higher-value rice, had an advantage over other varieties, vh-b: explains&#13;
vhy the leading farmers, in particular, have been switching to the bigher-&#13;
value crop in the last fev years. This conclusion, based on the data in&#13;
Table 5. hovever, needs to be regarded as tentative. IJ In general, bovever,&#13;
better returns and higher yields from the seed-fertilizer revolution have&#13;
significantl7 altered the allocation of resources among various crops. Some&#13;
cropo, sucb as wheat, have retained or extended the acreage that had cue-&#13;
t=marily been devoted to vinter cereals. Just as Basmati hbs replaced coar-&#13;
ser rice, in many areas other high-yielding rice varieties (Irri-6, for&#13;
e7ample) have replaced cotton in tradition%.l cotton-groving areas.&#13;
1/  The smaLl sample sizes used in Table 5 (aee footnote (a)) raise ques-&#13;
tions about hov representat'ive these samples are, while differences in&#13;
the cha:actatiatics of the two types of farmers measured would make&#13;
direct comparisons hazardoue.&#13;

The increases in crop prices have been partly responsiole for the&#13;
rising trenod in net returns, (see Annex, Table A.5). At the same time, the&#13;
prices of agricultural inputs have also declined in relative terms as a&#13;
result of very considerzble government subsidies (more in the next sectior.).&#13;
!s Table 6 shows, the ratio of fertilizer prices to major crop prires has&#13;
remained relativsely stable over the last decade. LJ This indicates that&#13;
prices of both fertilizers and crops have moved closer together. The excep-&#13;
tions are the years FY73-FY75 for wheat and Irri-6 rice, when sharp increases&#13;
in the price of fertilizer raised the ratio substantially. The further&#13;
increase in fertii:zer prices in February 1980 is reflected in the higher&#13;
rct.o for FY80, but upward adjustments ic crop prices were able to partially&#13;
offset this increase, so that even after two upward revisions in fertilizer&#13;
prices in FY82 and FY83, ratios would be no higher than the levels reached in&#13;
FY80.&#13;
Becaus- output prices in Pakistan have generally kept pace with&#13;
input prices, it it difficult to determine the price-induced effects on input&#13;
use. Gotsch and Falcon have suggested that input demand responses are of two&#13;
types. VJ For example, if the price of fertilizer is lowered, farmers already&#13;
using fertilizer may use more of it, or farmers not previously using chemicals&#13;

may noV decide to apply them. Though both typeo of response are important,&#13;
little is known about either of these effects, particularly the latter. It&#13;
is, however, generally believed tnat the price elasticity of iemand is low&#13;
for fertilizer and that its negative price effect is more than offset by the&#13;
positive income effect. _/ Support for the latter is found in numerous&#13;
benefit-cost analyses vhich have demonstrated the continued profitability of&#13;
using fertilizer (see Section V).&#13;

The charges for vater, another important input, vary widely depend-&#13;
ing on crops and areas. The charges for sugarcane are about three tines&#13;
those for vheat; those in the areas of salinity control and reclamation&#13;
projects (S'CARP) are about tvice those in areas with canal and tubevell eater&#13;
supplies (see Table 8). All water rates have increased about twofold between&#13;
FY66 a.d FY79. Crop prices however, have riaen, on the average, three to&#13;
four times over the same period, so that in FY80, water charges formed an&#13;
even smaller part of the gross returns to farmers than they did in FY70 (see&#13;
Table 9); these charges have also fallen in real terms. Table 10 shows that&#13;
in canal command areas, water rates in constart prices for wheat had, by&#13;
FY75, fallen to a third of its value in FY66; while for maize and oilseeds&#13;
th:y had fallen to one-fourth. The sharp increase (of 75%) over the !.ot&#13;
'cur years s;hould reverse this trend, but water c:larges remain only a small&#13;
prCportion of total production costs, and an even smaller proportion of the&#13;
vplue of total vater used. L/&#13;
11 See Chaudhary and Anhrez, OD cit., Chapter IV, for estimates of the value&#13;
of irrivated water supply. Taking all crops together, they estimated&#13;
vater charges to be only 2.5% of the total value of irrigated vater.&#13;
This was obtained by multiplying the marginal value product of vater&#13;
(estimated by zegression) by the average volume of water used.&#13;

nTe pricing of irrigation vater continues to arouse controversy in&#13;
Pakistan. Although vater charges have been increased from time to time, they&#13;
have never risen as fant as the prices received for agricultural commodities.&#13;
Consequently, the scarcity value of the vater being supplied is still sub-&#13;
stantially above the cost charged to the farmers. One indication of this&#13;
is the sale of vater by private farmers who awn tubewells; these charges are&#13;
some three to ten times those collected by the Irrigation Department. 1]&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The issue of appropriate water charges has been extensively dis-&#13;
cussed in several papers. Several analytic studies in the 1960s have&#13;
estimated the "real," or scarcity value of additional irrigation water in&#13;
Pakistan. 1/ In 1970, Cotsch and Falcon, using the marginal value concept,&#13;
estimated Rs 2 per acre-inch as a "fair approximation to long-run marginal&#13;
cost" for obtaining additional water from both public and private wells. 2/&#13;
The government charged, on the average, Rs 0.4 per acre-inch, while the value&#13;
to farmers often exceeded Rs 5 per acre-inch. These studies are unanimous in&#13;
their conclusion that water charges should be raised to cover at least the&#13;
ope. - .on and maintenance costs of irrigation wells. The main supporting&#13;
arguments for this view are summarized belaw.&#13;
1. Farmers are now better able to pay for the use of water, partly&#13;
because increases in crop prices have exceeded the increases in&#13;
water rates, and partly because productivity (and hence the&#13;
efficiency of water use) has improved. This conclusion needs to&#13;
be tempered to the extent that average figures for net returns&#13;
1/ A Bank study, based on SCARP IV, estimated the value in the range of&#13;
Rs 0.6 and Rs 3 per acre-inch.   Harza Engineering's estimates, valued at&#13;
the spillway of Tarbela Dam, was Rs 15.6 per acre-inch. Tipton and&#13;
Kalmbach"s estimate (also for the SCARP IV area) was Rs 2.6 per acre-&#13;
inch. Thlese differences arise because of the use of different concepts&#13;
and methods of measurements under different soil conditions. But&#13;
whatever the differences, it is clear that what the government charged&#13;
during that period-ranging from Rs 0.31 per acre-inch for rice to Rs&#13;
0.87 for oilseeds-was way below the scarcity value.&#13;
2/ Ibid.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
to farmers mask considerable variations acng feriere qnd among&#13;
holding sizes.&#13;
2.  The distributional impact of vater charges is often highly&#13;
ske.red.  Hovever, vater charges form orly a small proportion of&#13;
the cost of production (as sho-.rn in Table 9), so that farmers'&#13;
ability co pay may nor be severely compromised by even a sizable&#13;
increase in vater rates.&#13;
3.  For the aame reason, raising water charges need not reduce&#13;
farmers' incentives cver the long run. Farmers are fully aware&#13;
of the benefits of irrigation and raising charges is unlikely to&#13;
affect aggregate production. As with fertilizers, estimates of&#13;
the price elasticity of demand for water have been less than&#13;
one in value. j/&#13;

V. TAXES. SUBSIDIES. AND RESOURCE TRANSFERS&#13;
In Pakistan, the role of government in creating infrastructure for&#13;
agriculture has been extremely important because the proper allocation of&#13;
vater is of paramount importance to agricultural production. Vhile both&#13;
agricultural output and input prices have been major instruments of govern-&#13;
ment policy, the government also intervenes in agriculture through taxes and&#13;
financial subsidies.&#13;
The government's financial transfers affecting agriculture conslst&#13;
of taxes on, and subsidies to, the sector. Prior to the devaluation of the&#13;
rupee in 1972, agricultural taxation was light, and no duty vas levied on&#13;
exports. Discrimination against agricultural exports, hovever, took the form&#13;
of unfavorable exchange rates in the country's multiple exchange rate "bonus"&#13;
systez. Export duties on rice and cotton were introduced after devaluation&#13;
and they made up the bulk of all taxes on agriculture in the first half of&#13;
the 1970s. Profits from the rice and cotton export corporations (RECP and&#13;
CECP, respectively), established in 1973, also became, with rising prices,&#13;
major sources of revenue to the government (see Table 11). The decline in&#13;
international prices for Pakistan'o major exports and the need to protect&#13;
Pakistan's agricultural producers led to the removal of export taxes in FY78.&#13;
Profits of the export corporations became the predominant sources of export&#13;

taxation. There was virtually no direct tax on agricultural incomes. A land&#13;
tax was levied, but despite restructuring to increase progressivity in 1975,&#13;
revenues stagnated throughout the decade. I! Water charges were alsc levied,&#13;
but revenues from these represented only a fraction of the total operations&#13;
and maintenance cont of the country's irrigation system.&#13;
Subsidies for the import of fertilizers and for the use of pes-&#13;
ticides and herbicides are the major subsidies given to agriculture. The&#13;
rationale for subsidizing inputs is to provide "incentives" to agriculture.&#13;
Unlike higher commodity prices, it is argued, subsidies do not raise directly&#13;
food and rav material prices paid by urban consumers and the growing&#13;
industrial sector; they also ensure that the benefits of government expendi-&#13;
tures accrue only to cultivators using inputs to expand production. jI On the&#13;
1/ Farmers o:n irrigated land were exempt from land taxation if their&#13;
holdings were less than 11 acres. Famsers vith holdings between 25 and&#13;
50 acres had rates of assessment increased 50%. Those with more than 50&#13;
acres had rates increased 100%. Since the winter of 1982, the government&#13;
has introduced a new levy called ushr based on the gross value of&#13;
agricultural production. To make an allowance for production costs, the&#13;
levy is restricted to 75S of the vnlue of production and is collected&#13;
froar landowners and leaseholders (but not tenants) aL a rate of 5% of&#13;
their shatre of the produce. Farmers who produce 948 kg of wheat (or its&#13;
equivalent in value) are exempt. It is too early to make any judgmeat on&#13;
tbe impact of ushr on the transfer of resources from agriculture to other&#13;
sectors, or on the resources it has raised for the government. See&#13;

other hand, subsidies are a burden on scarce public resources. L/&#13;
In thte case of fertilizers, the rate of growth in its use has been&#13;
phenomenal and, along with the use of nev seeds, has been primarily respon-&#13;
sible for spectacular increases in grain production between 1964 and 1969.&#13;
Througbout the 1950s and 1960s, Pakistan maintained a "cheap" fertilizer&#13;
policy vith subsidies, during much of this time, a=ounting to as much as 50%.&#13;
The subsidy decreased in FY70 to about 30%, but rose thereafter, particularly&#13;
between FY73 and FY75; this rapid growth can be attributed to at least three&#13;
factors:&#13;
o F&amp;rmers' purchase price of fertilizer vas kept low after devalua-&#13;
tion to minimize the effect of devaluation on domestic prices of&#13;
basiic foods.&#13;
O  Thc increase in oil prices after 1973 made fertilizer imports&#13;
more expensive.&#13;
O  Fertilizer imports increased rapidly after FY75 as domestic&#13;
production vas unable to aeet demand.&#13;
Government subsidies for irrigation also increased, particularly after FY76,&#13;
reflecting the increasging need for maintenance of Pakist&amp;n's aging irrigation&#13;
mystem.&#13;
T/ Tis is pariticularly true fer fertilizers.     Evidence from India sug-&#13;
gests that 15 years of subsidy ought to be long enough for most farmers&#13;
to have a good acquaintance vith that input. See Shetty, N.S., "Agricul-&#13;
tural Innovations: Leaders and Laggards," Development Digest, April&#13;
1969.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Despite the increases in input prices, taxes collected from agricul-&#13;
ture were substantially larger than financial subsidies prcvided to the&#13;
sector up to FY77, resulting in a net transfer of public resources out of&#13;
agriculture. This situation was reversed after FY78, vhen total financial&#13;
subaidies exceeled tota! tax revenue fron agriculture. The decline in net&#13;
subaidies after FY80 has been due mainly to reduced fertilizer subsidies,&#13;
although reductions in subsidies for pesticides and irrigation vere also&#13;
contributory factors. With government plans to phase out the fertilizer&#13;
subsidy by 1985, under the Three Year Public Sector Development Program, and&#13;
major increases in the price of irrigation water (an increase of 75% in the&#13;
past four years), the level of subsidies is expected to decline in tbe next&#13;
five ycars.&#13;
In addition to financial subsidies, farmers receive an econoxic&#13;
subsidy if the prices for their products are higher than those that obtain in&#13;
the interr.ational market.  The size of this subsidy to producere is given by&#13;
the difference between the output value at domestic (procurement) prices and&#13;
that at vorld prices.   The higher the nominal rate of protection (that is,&#13;
the ratio between doesatic and border prices), the larger is the economic&#13;
subsidy. 1/ The total subsidy given to producers is the sum of financial and&#13;
economic subsidies.&#13;
J  For coqisumers, the subsidy is measured by the difference between the&#13;
value of consumption it world prices and that tt domestic (market)&#13;
prices..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
The ratios of domestic prices to international prices for the ma,jr&#13;
crops shown in Table 12 indicate that price discrimination hao historically&#13;
been most severe for wheat and for rice, particularly Basmati. LJ But with&#13;
the procurement prices raised significantly since FY81, domestic prices for&#13;
these crops have moved somewhat closer to international prices. The extent&#13;
of nominal protection for cotton vrs influenced cons:derably by wide fluctua-&#13;
tions in the international price; the recent experience has been a very close&#13;
alignment between the two prices. The only major crop which was protected&#13;
was sugar; domnestic priceo since FY81, whether in export or import parity&#13;
terms, have been substantially above international prices. Since the extent&#13;
of nominal protection is as much e function of exogenous price trends as one&#13;
of domestic piice policies, a strategy of aligning domestic prices to inter-&#13;
national prices will not only minimize the degree but also the variance of&#13;
price discrimination against protection of major crops. 2/&#13;
|j For the export crops o. rice and cotton, incidentals and other unit&#13;
costs have been added to procurement -prices to yield export parity&#13;
prices. For wheat and sugar, import perity prices have been used.&#13;
TJ This does not mean that domestic prices should be allowed to respond to&#13;
shcrt-term fluctuations in international prices, but rather that they&#13;
should be aligned to trends in international prices.&#13;

Tables 13-15 show calculatinns of total subsidy equivalents for&#13;
vheat and rice betveen the years 1972 and 1981. LJ In revieving these&#13;
calculations, the folloving observations should be noted:&#13;
o In the case of wheat, a part of the marketed produce is procured&#13;
by government for sa'e in ration shops at issue prices (assumed&#13;
to be equal to procurement prices) and the remainder is sold in&#13;
the open market at vholesale or retail prices. Z/ In the case of&#13;
rice, procurement for export is undertaken by RECP and the&#13;
balance is sold in the open market.&#13;
o  The calculatione take into account producers who are also con-&#13;
sumers by considering only marketed output, but do nct explicitly&#13;
recognize middlemen as a group.    The latter buy markftce  output&#13;
at around procurement prices and sell at wholesale or retail&#13;
prices; they are grouped together with consumers.&#13;
O No account is taken of the effects of price distorticns on demand&#13;
or supply.&#13;
Table 13 shovs that if price discrimination is takeu into account,&#13;
producer oubsidies for wheat are all negative, although the price appears to&#13;
J  Corresponding estimates for FY72-FY76 vere calculated by Gotach and&#13;
Brown, OD Cit.   However, these vere based upon sotmewhat different&#13;
assumptions.&#13;
ZI If the issue price is belov procurement price, the assumption under-&#13;
states the cost to the government of intervening in the market. Past&#13;
experience shows that the error resulting from this assumption las been&#13;
insignificaint.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

have improved from FY74.   This is because of the narroving gap between domes-&#13;
tic prices and import parity prices. Despite this, the adverse effects of&#13;
price discrimination considerably outweighed the favorable impact of finan-&#13;
cial subsidies to the sector. As recently as FY82, the proportional subsidy&#13;
equivalent-the value of the subsidy equivalent as a proportion of the value&#13;
of marketecd production in domestic prices--was as high as -43%.&#13;
H!uch the same picture is presented in Table 14, which shovs cor-&#13;
reaponding calculations for Basmati rice. Up to FY76, both government taxa-&#13;
tion and a very large gap between domestic and international prices. con-&#13;
tributed to a transfer of resources out of agriculture valued at almost, or&#13;
more than, the value of production in domeotic prices. As with wheat, price&#13;
discrimination has been reduced by a closer alignment between international&#13;
prices and export unit cost. For Irri-6 rice, these prices have become&#13;
almort identical by FY82, so that a positive subsidy equivalent--about 9X of&#13;
the value of marketed production at domestic prices--vas recorded. Ho-'ever,&#13;
this close alignment between domestic and international prices has resulted&#13;
mainly from a sharp fall in the latter rather than from an adjustmaent in tbe&#13;
domestic price.   Whether future pricing decisions vill be more responsive to&#13;
international price trends remain to be seen.&#13;

Simnilar calculations have not been made for cotton and sugarcane.&#13;
Data required for quantifying total subsidies for cotton are not available;&#13;
hovever, thic ratios between domestic and internaticnal prices for cotton&#13;
(shown in Table 12) suggest that of the four major crops, cotton may be least&#13;
subject to t:he distortionary effects of price policy. Since the domestic&#13;
price referred to ginned cotton, however, it is by no means obvious that this&#13;
has benefited cotton grovers vho sell their produce to ginners. These&#13;
remarks apply also to sugarcane, vhich appears to receive the heaviest&#13;
protection from government prici7g.&#13;
Tvo final points need to be noted. First, for all four major crops,&#13;
incidental unit costs represent sizable components of total domestic prices&#13;
ranging from 23% to 382.   Clearly, greater adainistrative efficiency vill cut&#13;
these costs and may lead to higber prices for producers. Second, although&#13;
discussion of -axes anx subsidies does not give a clear picture of resource&#13;
transfers for the entire agricultural sector, large groups of farmers were&#13;
subject to price discrimination .n excess of direct financial subsidies the&#13;
government provides to themn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
In the preceding sections, secondary data on agricultural prices and&#13;
uctivity, government taxes, and subsidies were analyzed. The analysis&#13;
its us to highlight several interesting implications. These are sum-&#13;
zed below.&#13;
The terma of trade between the agriculture sector and nonagriculture&#13;
Drs have not significantly deteriorated over the last decade. Indeed, if&#13;
it is taken into account, the purchasing power of agriculture has&#13;
ally improved in absolute terms, even if gradually. Similar improvemenL&#13;
iown when productivity increases are incorporated into the terms-of-trade&#13;
c. However, the linitations of the terms-of-trade index should be clear;&#13;
,urchasLng power of agriculture has vorsened if compared with other&#13;
)rs, partly on account of the more rapid grovth of nonagricultural&#13;
)rs.&#13;
The slov grovtb in productivity remains a major concern, par-&#13;
arly since the experiences of the "green revolution" period in Pakistan&#13;
-FY71), and those of other countries, have demonstrated that a much&#13;
r rate of improvement in productivity can be sustained. This has fre-&#13;
ly been discussed in the context of yields making a major contributioi&#13;
e grovth in output among the major crops.    Empirical evidence, hovev:r,&#13;
no support for this conclusion. In the 1970a, improvement in yields&#13;
t least as important as expansion of acreages in promoting the grovth in&#13;
t. Similarly, in the light of available data, it cannot be convincingly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
argued that grovth in output in recent years has almost exclusively been&#13;
accounted for by higher levels of inputs. Nevertheless, the need for&#13;
measures to raise productivity-such as improving the timeliness and quality&#13;
of inputs, better management techniques, efficient use of resources, and&#13;
minimizing distortionary effects of policy measures-is not diminished by&#13;
these findings.&#13;
3.    Covernment's policies on prices for crops and inputs have, in&#13;
general, been based on the principle of a fair return to farmers. Changes in&#13;
input prices have, therefore, alvays been accompanied (or folloved) by&#13;
adjustment:s in output prices in the same direction. This has contributed to&#13;
a gradual increase in farmers' incomes, although empirical evidence in sup-&#13;
port of this conclusion is, at best, partial and tentative. The observation&#13;
that farmers are more able to pay for inputs because of improvements in their&#13;
net returns finds some support in the data on "average leading" farmers in&#13;
Table 5. Hovever, an important qualification should be noted. Wide varis-&#13;
tions in farm sizes, in output per farm, and in agricultural incomes make&#13;
generalizations from the findings for "average leading farmers" hazardous.&#13;
4.    The argument that sharp increases in fertilizer prices will prove a&#13;
disincentive to farmers has some validity, especially if farmers perceive&#13;
that increases in the prices of inputs vill exceed any corresponding&#13;
increases in the prices chey get for their crops; this, at best, vill be a&#13;
short-term view. The gradual improvemente in agricultural incomes and&#13;
(still) highly favorable benefit-cost ratios in the use of fertilizer should,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bovever, point to the continued increase in the use of inputs in the medium&#13;
or long term.&#13;
5.    A similar conclusion applies to water charges, and for the same&#13;
reasons. lIaving said this, the principle of relating cost recovery to&#13;
operation-and-maintenance expenditures appears to be no more than an empiri-&#13;
cally convenieut rule of thumb. An economically optimal change can well lead&#13;
to one which recovers both fixed and variable costs. Major determinants of&#13;
this optimum are the demand for vater and the existence of a budget&#13;
constraint. V&#13;
6.    rhe picture of government financial subsidies to agriculture has&#13;
changed dramatically over the decade. In the early 1970s, the sector vas&#13;
taxed much more than it vas subsidized, but the position was reversed after&#13;
FY76. The future level of net financial subsidies to producers vill be&#13;
affected by two major developments. The first is the movement of domestic&#13;
prices closer to border prices which vill affect the profits of the state&#13;
1/  See George, K.D. and J. Shorey, The Allocation of Resources, Loodon,&#13;
Allen and Uovin, 1978. Where there are constraints on the budget, where&#13;
user charges are lov and the demand for the service is in excess of&#13;
supply, there ia a need to raise the user charges to at least the mar-&#13;
ginal cost of providing the service. The additional revenue thus&#13;
garnered can be used to expand the service. It has also been shovo that&#13;
"raising user charges in line vith the efficiency rule suggested vill&#13;
result in more of the poor benefiting as compared to the rich." See&#13;
Thobani, H., Charfinf User Fees for Social Services: The Case of&#13;
Education in Malavi, World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 572, Washington,&#13;
1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
trading corporations. The second is the success of the stated policy of&#13;
reducing the fertilizer subsidy and its eventual elimination after 1985.&#13;
7.    Increases in the net financial subsidies to agriculture has been&#13;
used to support arguments that the sector ia lightly taxed. As the calcula-&#13;
tions of economic subb dies have shown, such arguments are extremely&#13;
misleading. The extent of economic subsidization or taxation depends on the&#13;
ratio of domestic to international prices. For wheat and rice, domestic&#13;
prices historically have been substantially below their international levels.&#13;
For sugarcane, producers have been heavily protected. In the absence of&#13;
similar calculations for other crops and activities, the picture for the&#13;
sector as a whole is unclear. However, what can be emphasized is that while&#13;
massive increases in the fertilizer subsidy have raised the financial burden&#13;
of the government in the last three years, appropriate price policies that&#13;
are responsive to changes in international prices are likely to have as&#13;
salutary an effecl: as any attempt to reduce financial subsidies or increase&#13;
taxes.&#13;
8.    The calculations of subsidy equivalent values are based on a number&#13;
of simplifying assumptions and should therefore be regarded as indicative.&#13;
They do nevertheless provide a rudimentary framework for analyzing the&#13;
effecto of government policies on prices and taxes/subsidies on resource&#13;
transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.    The data presented here do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on&#13;
cbe impact of policy interventions on income distribution. Hcwever, to the&#13;
extent that all producers benefit from higher prices, while benefits from&#13;
subsidized inputs tend to accrue to larger producers, an even stronger case&#13;
can be made for according price policies the highest priority.&#13;
10.    Finally, the calculations in the tables and annexes highlight the&#13;
pitfalls of relying upon findings of other studies. Despite the scarcity of&#13;
data, the existing data base should be able to support much more quantitative&#13;
and qualitative analysis of major sources than exist at present.&#13;

            Prices, terms of trade, and the role of
            government in Pakistan's agriculture
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Despite the importance of agriculture to
            the national economy of Pakistan and the major role played
            by the government in its development, a number of key issues
            have not been adequately addressed by existing studies. This
            paper provides an empirical basis for discussion of changes
            in the agricultural terms of trade, growth of agricultural
            productivity and incomes, pricing of agricultural inputs and
            outputs, and subsidization and taxation of agriculture. It
            notes that the terms of trade between agriculture and the
            other sectors have not significantly deteriorated during the
            period 1960-83, and farmers' purchasing power has
            actually improved. Net returns to farmers increased until
            the recent sharp increases in fertilizer prices reversed
            this trend. Economic taxation of wheat and basmati rice in
            contrast to the economic subsidies provided to sugar should
            be a matter of concern. This paper argues that appropriate
            price policies which are responsive to changes in
            international prices are likely to have as salutary an
            effect as any attempt to reduce financial subsidies or to
            increase taxes.
