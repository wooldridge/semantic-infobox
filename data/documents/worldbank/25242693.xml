Part II Europe 2020 Programmatic Single-Donor Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission and&#13;
the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set forth&#13;
above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The sub-objectives and description of activities are:&#13;
2.1 The European Commission, particularly the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG&#13;
REGIO) supports the regional economic development goals of its member states. The 6th Cohesion report&#13;
of the Commission shows that governance problems not only delay the implementation of Cohesion&#13;
Policy programmes, but also reduce the impact of these investments. The report also highlights (i) that the&#13;
quality of governance is particularly low in the countries benefitting most from Cohesion Policy and (ii)&#13;
that there are significant disparities in the quality of governance both at national and regional level. A&#13;
comprehensive and comparable set of actionable regional governance indicators does not exist in the&#13;
European Union (EU). To this end, DG REGIO has requested the Bank's assistance in identifying and&#13;
developing actionable indicators measuring the quality and capacity of public administrations at national&#13;
and regional level of the EU Member States. The activity's overall objective is to inform the European&#13;
Commission and EU Member States' and to identify and develop a set of actionable governance&#13;
indicators that measure EU Member States' administrative capacity to implement cohesion programmes&#13;
at national and regional level.&#13;
The activities (which may be described as "components" of activities) to be financed by the Trust Fund,&#13;
in support of the sub-objectives cited in Section 2.1 above, are the following Bank-executed activities, for&#13;
which the Bank has implementation responsibility:&#13;
A.     Component One: Indicators of Strength of Public Management Systems&#13;
This Activity will seek to develop indicators that provide a means of assessing the strength and quality of&#13;
governance and public management systems in EU's regions as it links to the implementation of cohesion&#13;
policy and national and regional development goals. This activity draws on the recent Bank analytical&#13;
work on the Indicators of the Strength of Public Management Systems (ISPMS). The ISPMS initiative is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿a multi-stakeholder effort coordinated by the Bank which seeks to develop a consensus among&#13;
practitioners around a set of cross-national performance indicators of the strength and quality of&#13;
governance and public management systems.&#13;
ISPMS indicators are selected based on the following criteria, they: point governments towards actions&#13;
that they can take to address a performance problem ("actionable"); measure how institutions actually&#13;
work rather than what they look like ("behavioral"); measure management systems that are relevant for&#13;
achieving broader development outcomes ("action-worthy"); and use data that is routinely gathered&#13;
through existing systems, assessments and surveys. The ISPMS project has compiled a set of 100&#13;
indicators covering 188 countries (with a total of 22,700 observations) that meet these criteria. These&#13;
compiled indicators focus on five core public management systems such as financial management, tax&#13;
administration, procurement, public administration/civil service, etc., and draw on available international&#13;
indicator sets (including Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability, the Open Budget Survey,&#13;
Global Integrity and Doing Business).&#13;
The Bank can access additional information that the Bank is compiling on Financial Management&#13;
Information Systems, e-Government, Open Budget Data and Open Contracting Partnership.&#13;
In order to refine and narrow this large database of public sector management indicators, the Bank will:&#13;
1) Take stock of the available indicators that meet ISPMS criteria (including those listed&#13;
above and the ISPMS list) and identify a subset that are responsive to the objective of&#13;
measuring the strength and capacity of public sector management based on the Bank's&#13;
operational experience in supporting public sector reforms in EU Member States and&#13;
candidate countries.&#13;
2) Filter this subset of applicable indicators based on the availability of routinely collected&#13;
data by the European Commission, EU Member States, statistical authorities and other&#13;
stakeholders within the EU. Identify data and coverage gaps and propose means of closing&#13;
the gaps at a reasonable cost, exploring alternative data collection methods.&#13;
3) Draft Public Sector Indicator Report - Prepare initial Report on proposed public sector&#13;
management indicators, identifying data needs, coverage gaps and proposing data collection&#13;
and data mining alternatives&#13;
4) Participate to meetings with DG REGIO and other European Commission services in the&#13;
context of the European Commission's inter-service group on public sector modernization to&#13;
discuss and agree on the public sector indicators that should be tested under this component&#13;
through future piloting; including on:&#13;
*  feasibility of implementing the indicators for regions across the EU;&#13;
*  the extent to which the systems measured are "action-worthy" - behavioral change&#13;
in these systems is associated with improvements in development outcomes;&#13;
*  discuss measures the European Commission could take to strengthen the quality and&#13;
coverage of the selected indicators through administrative measures; and&#13;
*  identify lagging EU Member States and regions where selected indicators could be&#13;
piloted using existing data sets and data solicited from the pilot locations.&#13;
5) Finalize the Public Sector Indicator Report based on the outcome of the consultations.&#13;
B.     Component Two: Citizen-Focused Governance Indicators&#13;
This Activity will seek to develop indicators that provide a means of assessing the quality of public&#13;
service and the performance of public institutions from EU citizens' perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Citizen-focused governance embodies the spirit of public service - a government dedicated to serving&#13;
citizens. Citizen-focused governance indicators explore how institutions influence wellbeing, how&#13;
institutions impact citizen's behavior and what drives citizen's satisfaction and trust in public institutions.&#13;
Most measures of the quality of "public service" focus on citizens as clients, measuring the quality of&#13;
service delivery by looking at aspects of timeliness, cost and accessibility. Others - Gallup, World&#13;
Values Survey, and regional barometers - ask citizens directly the extent to which they trust government&#13;
officials or are satisfied with the services they receive.&#13;
The Bank will undertake a stocktaking of existing initiatives on governance and citizen engagement&#13;
indicators originating from civil society organizations, think tanks and researchers to better identify&#13;
existing approaches and indicators applicable to Europe. Particular attention will be given to the&#13;
indicator's complementarity with public management system datasets and open data. The work will be&#13;
complemented by dialogue with European CSOs and researchers to ensure feedback among a large group&#13;
of governance practitioners. The Bank will also explore the viability of a more innovative approach in&#13;
using data sets - such as household surveys, administrative data and data mining from open and private&#13;
sources - to measure citizen behavior and preferences. This approach seeks to overcome the limitations of&#13;
perception surveys by generating evidence of how citizens actually interact with public institutions.&#13;
The Bank will develop this basket of indicators through the following activities:&#13;
1)     Conduct a desk review of existing research and data using citizen-centric governance&#13;
indicators and compile a set of indicators available for use across EU Member States and sub-&#13;
national regions.&#13;
2)     Based on consultations with European Commission counterparts, conduct a series of&#13;
interviews and round tables with EU non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics&#13;
and survey firms to review the initial set of citizen-centric governance indicators and identify&#13;
additional indicators.  Consultations will result in a short Citizen-Centric Governance&#13;
Consultation Note summarizing the results and views of participants.&#13;
3)     Conduct a workshop with European Commission counterparts to test the proposed set&#13;
of citizen-centric governance indicators to determine the extent to which they are measurable,&#13;
actionable, action-worthy and complement available public administration data and other open&#13;
data.&#13;
4)     Produce Citizen-Centric Governance Indicator Report based on the Consultation Note&#13;
and outcomes of the European Commission workshop.&#13;
C. Component Three: Regulatory Governance Indicators&#13;
This Activity will seek to develop indicators that provide a means of assessing a country's or region's&#13;
capacity and practices to prepare, assess, consult and disseminate high-quality regulation. Regulatory&#13;
practices are a dimension of governance most closely linked to ensuring a level playing field for private&#13;
sector actors. Regulatory design and enforcement are at the forefront of investors' concerns. The quality&#13;
and predictability of interactions with licensors, inspectors, etc. is one of the key elements factoring into&#13;
investment decisions. As such, they contribute to competitiveness in the economy that drives economic&#13;
development in the regions.&#13;
Regulatory governance focuses on a critical dimension of institutional performance that is not adequately&#13;
captured by indicators of public management systems or other indicators of regulatory performance. In&#13;
order to address this gap, the World Bank Group has begun to develop a set of comparative indicators of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿the "de facto" quality of various dimensions of regulatory governance such as regulatory consultation,&#13;
transparency and ex-ante assessment. The indicators may be gradually expanded over the coming years to&#13;
include additional measures of regulatory governance. In addition, the Bank will look to develop&#13;
indicators measuring "regulatory delivery" - governments' capacity to enforce regulations or delivery a&#13;
regulatory service (e.g., a license).&#13;
Work on this dimension will draw upon insights from the full range of earlier indicator surveys in the&#13;
World Bank Group, including the Investment Climate Assessment, World Governance Indicators, Doing&#13;
Business, Sub-national Doing Business, as well as other work by academia, think tanks and others. Where&#13;
needed, the Bank can draw upon and integrate questions and data from the existing Doing Business&#13;
questionnaire, and design indicators which draw upon insights and specific data points used in the Doing&#13;
Business surveys.&#13;
This work stream will drill down into regulatory governance practices in EU Member States, widening&#13;
the scope of information collected and focusing on both the content and process of regulatory governance.&#13;
Building on initial work on indicators of regulatory governance, the Bank will undertake the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
1) Conduct an introductory workshop with European Commission counterparts,&#13;
represented in the inter-service group on public sector modernization to discuss possible areas&#13;
of measurement for regulatory governance and identify focal areas of geographic (and sector)&#13;
coverage. This workshop will also present results of an initial scanning and review of existing&#13;
indicators (including Doing Business and past sub-national surveys) capturing relevant&#13;
aspects of regulatory governance.&#13;
2) Review  and assess existing indicators capturing relevant aspects of regulatory&#13;
governance in order to select, refine and develop new indicators relevant for EU Member&#13;
States and regions. The review will focus on indicators' validity, reliability, the extent to&#13;
which they are actionable, and data collection methodologies in light of the possible scale of&#13;
the project. This activity will propose a set of questions that could be given to relevant&#13;
stakeholders, including both national and regional government officials and private sector&#13;
actors that can help to identify gaps in regulatory governance practices, regulatory delivery,&#13;
stakeholder awareness and usage.&#13;
3) Produce an initial Regulatory Governance Indicator Report that proposes a set of&#13;
regulatory governance indicators and sets out options for data collection methods. Indicators&#13;
will be assessed according to their validity, cost efficiency to measure and the extent to which&#13;
they are actionable.&#13;
4) Organize a workshop with European Commission services, represented in the inter-service&#13;
group on public sector modernization and external experts to discuss and reach consensus on:&#13;
* The applicable set of regulatory governance indicators;&#13;
*  Data collection methodology; and&#13;
*  Set of questions to be presented to national and regional government officials and&#13;
relevant stakeholders&#13;
5) Pilot the regulatory governance indicators in a few selected lagging EU regions/Member&#13;
States following agreement with DG REGIO.&#13;
6) Produce final Regulatory Governance Indicator Report based on outcome of the pilots&#13;
and evaluation of data collection methodologies.&#13;
D.     Methodology of Work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The scope and methodology of work will be based on three dimensions of governance: public&#13;
management systems, citizen-centric governance and regulatory governance. While the three dimensions&#13;
do not cover the full range possible governance systems, they provide information about key points in the&#13;
overall policy cycle: from policy formulation to policy implementation and delivery through user&#13;
feedback and corrective action and back again to policy formulation. Indicators of public sector&#13;
management assess core management systems against international standards and their effectiveness in&#13;
the formulation and implementation of public policies, including investment programmes co-financed by&#13;
cohesion policy. Citizen-centric governance indicators assess citizen engagement in and satisfaction with&#13;
the policy cycle. Regulatory governance indicators assess the process of policy formation, its&#13;
inclusiveness and openness. The Activity will also develop innovative measures of regulatory delivery in&#13;
order to assess the implementation of public sector policies under this dimension.&#13;
In order to identify an indicator set that measures the strength and quality of governance and public&#13;
administration systems across the EU at the national and regional levels, the Bank will undertake the&#13;
following steps as part of its work:&#13;
a) Stock taking of existing indicators in each dimension to identify those that are most action-worthy&#13;
and identify data access and measurement issues such as availability and cost-effectiveness of&#13;
data collection;&#13;
b) Identify any additional administrative management and performance issues not covered by&#13;
indicators in the existing dimensions and propose alternative measures to address these issues;&#13;
c) Identify a subset of the indicators that are believed to be most relevant (action-worthy, cost&#13;
effective to measure and actionable) in the EU context and best fit the objective of contributing&#13;
to inclusive economic growth; and&#13;
d) Use and test a subset of indicators to measure public administration capacity and performance&#13;
based on criteria of relevance to objective, cost-effectiveness of data generation and gathering.&#13;
The Bank will consult with DG REGIO and the inter-service group on public sector modernization of the&#13;
European Commission to identify a narrow group of lagging EU Member States and regions where the&#13;
indicators will be tested through the analysis of existing data. An initial testing of the application of the&#13;
regulatory governance indicators is included in the activities above.&#13;

kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;
activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;

Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;

Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If the Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
5.     Progress Reporting&#13;
5.1    The Bank shall provide the Donor with semi-annual reports on the progress of activities financed&#13;

Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donor) after such date to&#13;
the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreement(s)&#13;
of the Donor. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the&#13;
