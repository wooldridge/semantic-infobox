TRANSITION TOWARD MORE RAPID AND LABOR-INTENSiVE&#13;
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF THE PHILIPPINES&#13;
This paper analyzes the policies for accelerating industrial growth&#13;
and employment creation in the 1980s. The focus is on the ways in which home&#13;
industries can expand along lines of comparative advantage, improving their&#13;
efficiency and utilization of domestic resources, capital and labor. It also&#13;
considers the possibilities and requirements of continued growth of export&#13;
industries and their integration with the domestic economy. The paper supports&#13;
a broad concept of incentive policies, concentrating on measures to reduce&#13;
protection and make fiscal investment incentives and export promotion more&#13;
effective. A main theme of the paper is that policy reform to be effective&#13;
must be part of a comprehensive program for industrial development, including&#13;
also technological deepening, credit allocation, strengthening of key insti-&#13;
tutions, industry-specific planning and investment. The Philippines has been&#13;
treated as a case study of policy adaptation and industrial planning; it has&#13;
several characteristics giving its experience wide applicability, including&#13;
availability of low-cost productive labor, a moderately sized market making&#13;
integration with the world economy essential, improved manufactured export&#13;
performance needed to achieve longer-run balance of payments viability, strong&#13;
interest in overcoming regional disparities and establishing balance between&#13;
labor-intensive and capital-intensive industries.&#13;

TRANSITION TOWARtD MORE RAPID AND LABOR-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF THE PHILIPPINES 1/&#13;
I.   Objectives of industrial policy&#13;
In the 1980s, industrial policy in the developing countries will&#13;
necessarily have to face the tasks of accelerating output and export growth&#13;
and ensuring that new investment will create more jobs. Industry now assumes&#13;
a commanding position in all but the very poor and small countries, and no&#13;
development strategy is conceivable that does not assign a specific role to&#13;
manufacturing industries Countries will want to be able to generate their&#13;
own momentum of industrial growth to assure a reliable supply of key inputs&#13;
and enhance their own technological capability, while at the same time bene-&#13;
fitting from the dynamics of the world market. The objectives of policy must&#13;
be achieved despite a likely shortage of long-term capital, which is of&#13;
particular significance for large-scale, capital-intensive manufacturing. A&#13;
balance must necessarily be struck between generating employment and expand-&#13;
ing exports on the one hand and achieving the strong and well-balanced&#13;
industrial structure needed for longer-term growth on the other.&#13;
In most developing countries, industrialization was initially biased&#13;
in favor of import subst:Ltution. Governments played a substantial role in&#13;
providing incentives and finance. The pros and cons of these policies have&#13;
been extensively discussed in the literature. 2/ While import substitution&#13;
industries grew rapidly in the 1950s and early 1960s, they slowed down signifi-&#13;
cantly in the past 10-15 years. However, since the late 1960s, a growing&#13;
number of countries have increased their manufactured exports dynamically,&#13;
mostly of labor-intensive items.&#13;
The issue for many countries in the 1980s is how they can reorient&#13;
their industrial policies towards achieving increased growth in the home&#13;
industries while maintaining a forward momentum of the export industries.&#13;
This calls for broad-based improvements in the performance of home industries',&#13;
stressing greater utilization of comparative advantage and product speciali-&#13;
zation associated with job creation, training and entrepreneurial development,&#13;
improved capital efficiency and technological development. Increased reliance&#13;
on more rational industrial incentives may usually best be achieved in a&#13;

gradual manner. A gradual approach will permit "market forces" to be&#13;
supplemented by industry-specific measures, e.g., in assisting rehabilita-&#13;
tion, new investment, resettlement and retraining. These measures will&#13;
help industry adjust to lower protection levels.&#13;
A related general issue is the likely coexistence and necessary&#13;
integration of efficient export industries with initially often less&#13;
efficient home industries. The former can be built up rather quickly,&#13;
frequently with production and marketing assistance from abroad; financing&#13;
requirements are moderate and easy to meet. The home industries are older&#13;
and well entrenched, many receiving special fiscal and financial incentives&#13;
and high protection. Industrialists and entrepreneurs in the two sectors&#13;
may have quite different characteristics, with home producers being well&#13;
established and export producers rather new on the scene, sometimes small-&#13;
scale operators, and experiencing difficulties in getting investment finance&#13;
from conventional sources. Reorienting home industry towards a more open&#13;
economy and greater efficiency may take considerable time and investment.&#13;
But increasing integration between home and export industries seems essential&#13;
if the latter are not to remain a dynamic enclave in a slower economy and&#13;
the former are to improve their contribution to development objectives.&#13;
The orientation of industry must necessarily be labor-intensive.&#13;
Most countries have a rapidly growing labor force, already suffer from high&#13;
unemployment and have a comparative advantage in labor-intensive production.&#13;
But this does not mean that large-scale, capital-intensive industries must&#13;
be neglected. On the contrary, they are needed to achieve balance in the&#13;
industrial structure, provide a strong base for longer-term development and&#13;
technological deepening. But, as exemplified by the case discussed in this&#13;
article, in a world of scarce capital and foreign exzhange resources, decisions&#13;
on large-scale, capital-intensive projects must be based on a careful weighing&#13;
of the economic costs and benefits.&#13;
The experience in the Philippines is presented here as an illustra-&#13;
tion of the policy issues that arise in a reorientation of industrial develop-&#13;
ment. The country has several characteristics that give its experience wide&#13;
applicability:&#13;
(a) The Philippines is a middle-income country with a moderately&#13;
sized market. While its market size permits some economic&#13;
operation of large-scale, capital-intensive industry, its&#13;
manufacturing growth must necessarily be in tune with the&#13;
world market;&#13;
(b) It has a substantial supply of low-cost labor that has proved&#13;
to be highly productive under suitable conditions and can be&#13;
easily trained;&#13;
(c) Although tariff protection is still high, for almost a decade&#13;
its foreign trade and exchange regime has been liberalized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
significantly, and the Philippines has made a highly success-&#13;
ful start in promoting exports. Although the deterioration in&#13;
the terms of trade has made management of the balance of pay-&#13;
ments difficult, issues of industrial and trade policy do not&#13;
have to be tackled in a crisis atmosphere. Continued export&#13;
growth is essential for a sound balance-of-payments position;&#13;
(d) The Ministry of Industry, Board of Investments (BOI) and other&#13;
government: agencies have built up a competent technical staff,&#13;
which makes it possible to pursue a comprehensive and rational&#13;
industria:L policy, undertake industry-specific planning, and&#13;
provide investment incentives and finance;&#13;
(e) Given the present limited scope of basic industries, planning&#13;
must strike a balance between large-scale, capital-intensive&#13;
industries on the one hand, and labor-intensive industries on&#13;
the other.;&#13;
(f) The country has formidable problems in overcoming poverty and&#13;
disparities among geographic regions. It has initiated policies&#13;
favorable to small-scale enterprises and regional development to&#13;
help overcome these problems.&#13;
The following analysis is based on conditions in the Philippines&#13;
prevailing at the end of 1978 or early 1979. Since then the Government has&#13;
taken several steps in a reform program which implements a number of recommenda-&#13;
tions made in this paper.. The program envisages action on protection, invest-&#13;
ment incentives and export promotions.&#13;
The objective of the Government's protection policy is to promote&#13;
industries in which the ]?hilippines has a comparative advantage and to foster&#13;
greater competitiveness, capital efficiency, and labor use. With this objective,&#13;
the Government seeks to achieve a phased general lowering and evening out of&#13;
tariff rates. This restructuring of the tariff is to be accompanied by&#13;
elimination of import licensing. The reform of the tariff code will be a key&#13;
element in the Government's industrial restructuring program. As an initial&#13;
step in this direction, many tariff rates will be lowered including bringing&#13;
down peak rates to 50%. In certain under-protected industries, tariffs will&#13;
be increased.&#13;
While investment incentives will be continued, the Government con-&#13;
siders it important to s:implify the present range of incentives, by seeking&#13;
to make certain incentives more readily available to all industry, and to&#13;
continue to reduce the current bias in favor of capital intensity. In adminis-&#13;
tering investment incent:Lve policies, the Board of Investment will give special&#13;
attention to capital efficiency, return on investment, employment creation,&#13;
foreign exchange earnings, and regional dispersal of industry. A greater&#13;
proportion of projects approved for investment incentives are expected to be&#13;
labor-intensive. The Board of Investment intends to narrow the range of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
industries to which preferred attention will be given. Matured industries&#13;
will no longer receive new incentives. Selected priority industries will&#13;
be singled out for special focus. For some of these industries such as&#13;
food processing and mechanical engineering, formulation of special sub-sector&#13;
development strategies will be initiated.&#13;
Special attention will be given to the location of new industrial&#13;
projects in the outer regions. With this purpose, the Board may, at times,&#13;
permit somewhat lower rates of return in the outer regions.&#13;
The Government's policy is that non-traditional export manufacturing&#13;
should be free of taxation on imports of raw materials and components and&#13;
that this principle should also be extended to indirect exports (i.e., to&#13;
sales of domestically produced inputs to export industries). It also regards&#13;
maintenance of an appropriate exchange rate policy as crucial to stimulating&#13;
the necessary rapid expansion of exports, in addition to its role in comple-&#13;
menting the revised tariff policy in providing reasonable protection to&#13;
domestic industry. The free trade export regime, already established under&#13;
existing legislation, will be progressively extended to all export manufactur-&#13;
ing. The Government has already taken several measures to expand its export&#13;
promotion program and has made rapid progress in this area. The Government&#13;
also contemplates several measures to improve availability of credit for&#13;
working capital to export manufactures, including small and medium sized firms.&#13;
II. Achievements in manufacturing in the Philippines 1/&#13;
Changes in policy since the 1950s&#13;
Manufacturing has become a significant factor in Philippine develop-&#13;
ment and will continue to be so. It now accounts for one-fourth of GDP and,&#13;
in relative size, compares well with that of Mexico and the Republic of Korea.&#13;
Any Philippine development strategy must specify the role of industry in&#13;
raising output, creating employment and more equitable conditions among popula-&#13;
tion groups and geographic regions.&#13;
The pace and pattern of Philippine industrial growth suggests that&#13;
the 1970s marked a significant change in that a rapidly growing labor intensive&#13;
export sector was established.&#13;
In the 1950s and 1960s, industrialization tended to favor production&#13;
for the home market, and incentives benefitted capital-intensive industries.&#13;
The industrialization pattern may well have reinforced regional and income&#13;
disparities, since its effect in expanding employment and raising income of&#13;
the poor was small.&#13;
1/ Changes and impact of longer-term trends in policy have been analyzed by&#13;
several authors, including Baldwin, Bautista, Power, Sicat and Valdepenas&#13;
(References 1, 2, 4 and 5). See also the ILO and IBRD Report (References&#13;
3 and 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Starting in the 1950s, import substitution of consumer goods became&#13;
the principal policy instrument to promote industrialization. Initially, the&#13;
manufacturing sector responded favorably, with output growing at an average&#13;
annual rate of over 12,% from 1950 to 1957. However, by the late 1950s, the&#13;
domestic market started to limit the expansion of the sector, and output&#13;
growth fell to an average level of 5% per annum. The sector no longer led&#13;
Philippine development,&#13;
Although the strict import restrictions prevailing in the 1950s&#13;
were gradually decontrolled in the early 1960s, they were replaced by a highly&#13;
protective tariff system (instituted in 1957). Policy reform in the 1960s&#13;
therefore did not alter the bias of the incentive system in favor of import&#13;
substitution. Manufacturing was limited in its backward integration and in&#13;
developing new exports.. Since 1956, total employment in the manufacturing&#13;
sector remained virtually constant at 10-12% of total employment, growing at&#13;
an average rate of less than 3% per annum.&#13;
In the period 1970-79, the industrial incentive policies of the&#13;
Philippines have undergone several significant changes, including a steep&#13;
devaluation, measures to help small, labor-intensive industries and the intro-&#13;
duction of various export incentives. As a result of these new measures, both&#13;
growth and labor intensity have improved, processing of raw materials for&#13;
export has increased, and industrialization may well have reached a turning&#13;
point in the second half of this decade.&#13;
Export growth&#13;
The rapid growth of non-traditional manufactured exports is changing&#13;
the composition of industrial output, accelerating its growth and creating many&#13;
more jobs. These exports increased by 30% per annum in real terms over the&#13;
1972-1977 period,and exceeded $1 billion in 1978 (28% of total export earnings).&#13;
The impetus of manufactured export growth has come from a few labor-&#13;
intensive products; garments and electronic products and handicrafts account!ed&#13;
for two-thirds of the total in 1978. In addition to its strong resource base,&#13;
the comparative advantage of the Philippines lies in the utilization of skilled&#13;
low-cost labor. In the export industries, Philippine labor productivity and&#13;
management compare favorably with those in competing countries. From 1972 to&#13;
1978, as a result of shifts in the exchange rate and wage relationships,&#13;
Philippine wages have declined significantly relative to those in both com-&#13;
petitor and customer countries (vis-A-vis Japan, Federal Republic of Germany,&#13;
and Republic of Korea by 50% and the United States of America by 17%). While&#13;
the productivity in home (nonexport) industries has lagged, productivity in&#13;
Philippine export industries improved by 13% during the period 1969-1974, thus&#13;
until recently keeping pace with manufacturing productivity in such countries&#13;
as Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and Republic of Korea. At the end of&#13;
1978, Philippine wages were about one-third to one-half of those in competing&#13;
countries such as the Rtepublic of Korea. The Philippines and other countries&#13;
in a similar position can benefit from a widening of the markets for their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
products as these competing countries, in response to increases in their own&#13;
labor costs and to the filling of import quotas for their products, move&#13;
towards higher quality and more sophisticated products.&#13;
Structure of industry&#13;
The Philippine manufacturing structure is highly dualistic. The&#13;
distribution of both employment and value added has a very pronounced&#13;
skewedness. "Unorganized" manufacturing employs nearly two-thirds of the&#13;
manufacturing work force, but produces only a small fraction of total value&#13;
added in manufacturing. However, the "organized" sector clearly produces&#13;
most of the value added in manufacturing. The unevenness between shares in&#13;
value added and employment is even more marked for the large establishments&#13;
(with over 200 workers each) and has become increasingly pronounced over&#13;
time.&#13;
The composition of manufacturing value added has changed little&#13;
over the last 10 years. Food processing, including beverages and tobacco,&#13;
has consistently contributed well over one-third of total manufacturing value&#13;
added. The contribution of the chemical industries, including rubber and&#13;
products of petroleum and coal, steadily increased in importance, while the&#13;
share of all other industries fell gradually over time. As expected under the&#13;
prevailing tariff and trade regime, consumer goods constituted about 55% of&#13;
manufacturing value added until 1970. But its share fell to 47.9% in 1977&#13;
mainly as a result of the rapid increase in the production of intermediate&#13;
goods, particularly chemicals (see Table 1).&#13;
Cross-country comparisons, based on a methodology adopted from&#13;
Chenery and Syrquin (Reference 6), show that, given the country's size and&#13;
income level, the Philippine manufacturing sector in 1973 as a whole was&#13;
larger (measured as a percentage of GNP) than one would have expected, while&#13;
its services sector was smaller. Within the manufacturing sector, this seems&#13;
to be mainly the result of the large size of resource-based industries (food&#13;
and wood) and to a lesser extent of the chemical industries. On the other&#13;
hand, the textiles, clothing and metal industries appear to be considerably&#13;
smaller than expected from international comparison (see Table 2). A&#13;
comparison with the Republic of Korea shows that the Philippine food industry&#13;
is larger than that of the Republic of Korea.&#13;
Investment, capital intensity and growth&#13;
The pattern of investment changed but little between the 1960s and&#13;
the first half of the 1970s, despite the trade and export policy measures&#13;
taken in the early 1970s. The food and textiles industries received the major&#13;
share of manufacturing investment during the period 1960-1975, closely followed&#13;
by such capital-intensive sectors as chemicals, oil and coal products, non-&#13;
metallic minerals and basic metals (see Table 3).&#13;
A rough comparison can be made of the investment and growth pattern&#13;
of the investment and growth pattern of relatively capital versus labor-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
intensive industries. In the Philippines industry spectrum, textiles,&#13;
beverages and printing are included as relatively labor-intensive. Comparing&#13;
the first half of the seventies with the sixties suggests that the share of&#13;
investment going into relatively capital-intensive industries increased&#13;
slightly in the early seventies. Yet the output growth of relatively&#13;
capital-intensive industries declined, while that of relatively labor-&#13;
intensive industries improved.   (See Tables 4 and 5)&#13;
While the Philippine incentive system has tended to encourage&#13;
capital-intensive industries, visits to individual plants suggest that&#13;
Philippine manufacturing usually employs fairly labor-intensive methods.&#13;
One encounters few, in any case, of excessive capital intensity. Economic&#13;
data on 44 plants visited by a World Bank mission are given in Table 6.&#13;
Export-oriented firms had a capital investment per worker of $2,800 and&#13;
firms with predominantly domestic orientation, $22,000. The recent growth&#13;
of labor-intensive induastries in the organized sector has thus significantly&#13;
enhanced the contribution of manufacturing to Philippine employment.&#13;
Average capital investment per unit of labor employed tends to&#13;
rise with the size of establishment, except in the case of the furniture&#13;
industry. Capital efficiency (as indicated by value added per unit of&#13;
capital) shows considerable variation among establishment sizes in different&#13;
industries. Small establishments are more efficient in their use of capital&#13;
than larger enterprises in such industries as tobacco, textiles, wood manu-&#13;
facturing and miscellaneous, mainly light, industries, e.g., rubber shoes,&#13;
foundries and metalworking plants. On the other hand, larger establishments&#13;
appear to be more capital efficient in the food and beverage industries,&#13;
furniture manufacturing and in such capital-intensive industries producing&#13;
chemicals, oil and coal products and transport equipment (see Table 7).&#13;
Manufacturing employment&#13;
The growth oE manufacturing employment reflects the dualistic&#13;
structure of the sector. At 1.6 million jobs in 1977, manufacturing provided&#13;
only just over 10% of total national employment, with as much as one million&#13;
in the cottage sector. Factory employment has tended to rise more than&#13;
twice as fast as total manufacturing employment (see Table 8).&#13;
A complex of causes accounts for the limited labor absorption of&#13;
Philippine manufacturing. The most labor-intensive sector, the cottage&#13;
industries, has remained the most important in providing employment but, in&#13;
terms of employment growth, has steadily lagged behind the more capital-&#13;
intensive factory sector. Within the factory sector, the Government had a&#13;
considerable influence on the composition of new industries and the choice of&#13;
technology through the provision of official credit and investment incentives.&#13;
In the 1960s, output and investment in industries with higher capital intensity&#13;
grew more rapidly than in more labor-intensive industries producing for the&#13;
home market and processing primary exports. These incentives themselves had&#13;
a pro-capital bias, and the pricing of capital goods in the economy reinforced&#13;
the capital-intensive bias in the factory sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
With the growth of labor-intensive, nontraditional manufactured&#13;
exports after 1970, however, labor absorption of Philippines manufacturing&#13;
has improved. The employment elasticity during the period 1970-1977 in non-&#13;
traditional export manufacturing was estimated at 1.0 as against 0.6 for&#13;
processed primary exports as 0.32 for industries producing for the home&#13;
market. Consequently, exports of nontraditional manufactures probably&#13;
accounted for more than 30% of manufacturing employment creation during the&#13;
period 1970-1977 while accounting for less than 8% of manufacturing investment.&#13;
III. Industrial policy: an assessment of performance&#13;
The industrial growth of the Philippines reflects in several respects&#13;
the orientation of policy pursued by the Government over a period of two or&#13;
three decades. Industrial policy will be discussed here under three headings:&#13;
tariff protection, investment incentives and export promotion.&#13;
Before turning to these principal policy areas it would seem well&#13;
to recapitulate some of the major problems to which policy must be addressed.&#13;
Mention has already been made of the sluggish employment record and the slow&#13;
output growth in home industries in recent years, slow particularly in relation&#13;
to other middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific or the major Latin&#13;
American countries. Further, except for resource-based industries, manufactur-&#13;
ing growth has been heavily concentrated in the Manila metropolitan area for&#13;
reasons of orientation towards the home market, geography, infrastructure and&#13;
credit availability. This combination of forces, operating in a geographically&#13;
diverse island republic, has caused one of the most marked degrees of industrial&#13;
concentration anywhere. Growth has proceeded to a point where several industries,&#13;
e.g., food processing and clothing, have now reached a state of maturity to&#13;
which they no longer need special incentives. Reduced reliance on special&#13;
incentives makes the pursuit of appropriate general policies (especially&#13;
exchange rate, wage, financial and budgetary) even more essential. On the&#13;
other hand, while certain industries have grown rapidly, others have been left&#13;
behind, notably the producer goods industries. To live up to their potential,&#13;
these industries should receive more incentives.&#13;
A number of industries are in need of rehabilitation or new invest-&#13;
ment to make them more efficient and competitive and to enable them to make&#13;
more efficient use of capital. Some of these also suffer from "overcrowded"&#13;
conditions, a state of excess capacity caused by a complex of factors,&#13;
including poor incentives for sound facility planning, sometimes excessive&#13;
availability of long-term (often concessionary) finance, and over protection.&#13;
Emphasis is placed on the need for continuing expansion of labor-&#13;
intensive industries. But the Government also wants to give attention to&#13;
certain imbalances in the industrial structure which to correct will require&#13;
substantial investments in capital-intensive industry. Failure to correct&#13;
them may eventually impose a costly burden on the industrializing economy.&#13;
Thus the cement industry should be expanded if it is to keep abreast of&#13;
prospective domestic demand. And while the country has developed a steel&#13;
rolling industry, it still imports slabs and billets, items the supply of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
which could become unreliable or costly should worldwide shortages develop.&#13;
Hence, there is a case for considering an integrated steel operation at an&#13;
appropriate time to establish balance in the industry. As is also the case&#13;
with the petro-chemical industry, the large investments involved (and their&#13;
poor payoff in terms of total employment creation) make careful economic&#13;
planning and time-phasing essential.&#13;
Tariff Protection&#13;
The combined effect of the incentive measures has been to build a&#13;
bias in favor of production for the home market and impose a penalty on the&#13;
export industries, which has been reduced by access to duty-free imports.&#13;
Philippine incentives also have had the effect of lowering the price of capital&#13;
goods relative to consumer goods. Tariffs have favored more capital-intensive&#13;
import substitution, while the tariff on capital goods has itself been low.&#13;
In addition, investment: incentives have the effect of reducing the cost of&#13;
capital equipment. It is the larger, usually more capital-intensive firms,&#13;
that have benefitted most from these incentives.&#13;
The key element characterizing Philippine industrial policy since&#13;
the early 1950s has been the protection of the domestic industrial sector&#13;
from competition from imports. The level of protection rates for the domestic&#13;
market is high and has remained so since the mid-1960s. The data in Table 9&#13;
are based on the 1974 tariff code and do not allow for redundancy of import&#13;
licensing. The average level of effective protection for the entire economy&#13;
in 1974 has been estimated at 36% by Bautista and Power (Reference 5). For&#13;
manufacturing, the average level of effective protection declined from 51%&#13;
in 1965 to 44% in 1974. Protection of inputs into construction declined&#13;
significantly during the period. Despite the overall decline, the cascading&#13;
structure is still strong, with capital and intermediate goods receiving&#13;
relatively low protection. In particular, the capital goods sector is under-&#13;
protected. The export sector is penalized where producers are subject to&#13;
taxes, in particular orn their inputs. In practice, under the Export Incentives&#13;
Act, many export firms have since 1970 been put on a free-trade basis. Since&#13;
1974, several tariff items have been reduced, but the 1974 estimates still&#13;
correctly reflect the overall tariff structure and level as of the end of 1978.&#13;
Tariff protection has had an adverse impact on manufacturing in&#13;
several aspects:&#13;
(a) It has tended to channel resources into industries, usually&#13;
capital intensive, where the Philippines has less comparative&#13;
advantage and has penalized labor-intensive products (e.g.,&#13;
simple producer goods in the mechanical engineering industry);&#13;
(b) It has encouraged high costs, inefficient use of capital and&#13;
excess capacity. Examples are the textile and steel rolling&#13;
industries;&#13;
(c) It has penalized exports by taxing imported inputs or permitting&#13;
domestic inputs to be produced at high costs and low quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
The general penalty imposed on those exports from tariff&#13;
protection averaged 30% in 1974. Examples are textiles,&#13;
steel products and cans (for the food processing industry).&#13;
Effective protection in the Philippines seems to be in the middle&#13;
range when compared with other countries. Countries that have experienced&#13;
very poor performance with respect to economic growth and export growth&#13;
have frequently had high rates of effective protection. For example, Chile&#13;
and India have been among the developing countries most heavily protecting&#13;
their industrial sectors (see Table 10). Their average annual total export&#13;
growth rates for the period 1966-1973 have been a slow 5% and 8% respectively;&#13;
manufacturing exports grew not at all in Chile and at 7% annually for India. 1/&#13;
In addition to the association between low rates of effective protection and&#13;
high rates of manufactured export growth, reductions in high rates of protection&#13;
are frequently associated with an acceleration in industrial export growth.&#13;
In Argentina, Brazil, Republic of Korea and Thailand, substantial growth in&#13;
manufactured exports accompanied import liberalization measures.&#13;
Investment incentives&#13;
Complementing protection through tariffs are fiscal incentives granted&#13;
under the Investment Incentives Act (1967) and the Export Incentives Act (1971).&#13;
The legislation, administered by the Board of Investments (BOI), is designed&#13;
to stimulate projects where domestic capacity falls short of domestic demand&#13;
and projects with export potential.&#13;
A wide range of industries have received benefits from the BOI.&#13;
Under the Investment Incentives Act, the most benefits have gone to copper&#13;
smelting and refining, pulp and paper, chemicals and chemical products and&#13;
synthetic textile fibers. From available data, it would appear that under the&#13;
Investment Incentives Act the industries that have received the most benefits&#13;
in recent years are raw material processing, pulp and paper, chemicals and&#13;
chemical products and synthetic textile fibers.&#13;
A substantial proportion of the fiscal benefits granted consists of&#13;
subsidies on the use of capital. For projects registered under the Investment&#13;
Incentives Act, the exemption of import taxes on imported capital equipment&#13;
and the accelerated depreciation allowance amounted to 40% of the total&#13;
value of the incentives granted in 1977 (65% in 1975). While these incentives&#13;
are also significant for export projects, other incentives, not involving a&#13;
subsidy on capital use, emerge as the most relevant. In particular, the&#13;
provision allowing for the deduction from taxable income of an amount related&#13;
to labor costs and indigenous raw materials expenditure accounted for 53% of&#13;
the value of the incentives to export-oriented, BOI-registered firms in 1977.&#13;
The tax credits for import taxes on products used in export production accounted&#13;
for an additional 21%. Tariff exemptions on imports used in export production&#13;
1/ C.f. Balassa, 1978, Reference 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
are permitted under three additional programs: (a) the permission for some&#13;
BOI-registered firms to operate bonded manufacturing warehouses; (b) the&#13;
drawback scheme, which refunds the tariffs paid, and (c) export processing&#13;
zones.&#13;
The protective effect of the investment incentives has been small&#13;
in the aggregate. Although tariff rates averaged 38.9% in 1974, Bautista&#13;
and Power have estimated that the tariff equivalent of tax subsidies averaged&#13;
only 1.4%. The reason for this insignificance at the aggregate level is that&#13;
the incentives and the output of BOI-registered firms are quite small in&#13;
relation to output for the entire industry. However, seen from the point of&#13;
view of the individual firm, BOI benefits can be an important factor in its&#13;
profitability. Measured as a percentage of sales, the benefits frequently&#13;
do not exceed the equivalent of more than 2-3%, but sometimes range up to&#13;
25-30% (Bautista and Pcwer, Reference 5).&#13;
If the magnitude of the investment incentives for domestic market&#13;
production is seen to be quite small in the aggregate, the same is the case&#13;
for the incentives for exports. Yet the aggregate is not the most relevant&#13;
measure. What matters is the effect that the incentives have on the&#13;
profitability of individual firms. The BOI incentives can reach considerable&#13;
magnitudes, especially if large investments are made. For the aggregate of&#13;
all recipient firms in 1977, the total subsidies and rebates received under&#13;
the Export Incentives Act amounted to 9% of their export sales. This amount&#13;
has increased in recent years; in 1973 it was only 3%.&#13;
Benefits under the Investment Incentives Act have tended to go to&#13;
the larger and more capital-intensive firms, both firms producing for the home&#13;
market and primary export processing firms. In 1977, some 62% of benefits&#13;
went to firms in industries with above average capital intensity. A small&#13;
portion of the benefits went to smaller firms (e.g., with fixed assets of&#13;
less than 5 million pesos). On the other hand, benefits under the Export&#13;
Incentives Act have been more evenly distributed over firms of varying size&#13;
and have gone to more laLbor-intensive firms. Export-oriented firms have&#13;
received benefits under both Acts, with the benefits under the Investment&#13;
Incentives Act going to more capital-intensive firms than those under the&#13;
Export Incentives Act. Finally, the capital intensity of BOI-preferred&#13;
projects was generally higher than industry averages while capital efficiency&#13;
estimates were lower.&#13;
*Besides fiscaLl benefits, registration with the BOI may convey&#13;
additional advantages. Such registration in effect constitutes a governmental&#13;
recognition and tacit approval of the firm and its activities. On the basis&#13;
of this recognition, thLe firm's dealings with other agencies of the Government&#13;
may be facilitated. Fc,r instance, with a letter of endorsement from the BOI,&#13;
it is easier for a firm to obtain foreign exchange for marketing efforts&#13;
abroad. In addition, the Central Bank is also said to treat a firm's&#13;
requests for import licenses more expeditiously if it is a BOI-registered&#13;
firm. Finally, BOI registration may facilitate access to long-term credit&#13;
from official financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
As the manufacturing sector grows, it is important that the fiscal&#13;
incentive system be simplified and administered with a minimum degree of&#13;
case-by-case discretion. Then the technical staff assembled over the past&#13;
decade could focus on priority issues and economic evaluation. The range&#13;
of possible incentives is complex and could be narrowed down, inter alia,&#13;
by making selected incentives generally available. Decisions on investment&#13;
incentives should increasingly be governed by considerations of employment&#13;
creation, comparative advantage and regional dispersion of industry.&#13;
The list of industries eligible for investment incentive has become&#13;
very long. Greater selectivity would result from more detailed subsector&#13;
planning such as is needed in the metalworking industries. In the next phase&#13;
of Philippine industrialization, the provision of adequate long-term finance&#13;
may be more effective than special fiscal incentives in influencing the&#13;
pattern of industrialization. Subsector planning and investment decisions&#13;
should be linked with the extension of long-term finance.&#13;
Export promotion&#13;
The effect of the protection system in the Philippines is to impose&#13;
the equivalent of a tax on the export sector, the magnitude of which is&#13;
roughly reflected by the average level of protection. Estimates of the&#13;
distortions imposed on the economy range from 19 to 34% (Bautista and Power,&#13;
Reference 5). The higher estimate, based on the UNIDO procedure, assumes&#13;
the existing protective structures. The actual price effect in case of full&#13;
removal of protection might, of course, be smaller, depending on the accompany-&#13;
ing adjustments in the balance of payments, in particular the increase in exports&#13;
that would be associated with a change in protection policy.&#13;
The tariff and tax disincentives for export industries have, since&#13;
the early 1970s, been partly offset by putting approved export producers&#13;
on a free-trade basis. Bonded (manufacturing) warehouses and other arrange-&#13;
ments free exporters from paying duty on imported inputs, which would other-.&#13;
wise represent a sizable penalty on export production (e.g., equivalent to&#13;
150% of value added in the garment industry). These facilities are separate&#13;
from the fiscal incentives described in the previous section. As is evident&#13;
from the dynamic growth of nontraditional manufactured exports, industries&#13;
under this selective free-trade regime have benefitted greatly, and the profit&#13;
opportunities provided by free-trade arrangements for serving large export&#13;
markets have been sufficient to draw some resources away from the more&#13;
profitable but limited domestic market. However, as a group, potential direct&#13;
and indirect export industries that are subject to tariffs still pay a&#13;
significant penalty on export sales. Continued export growth--which would&#13;
rely in part on achieving both a more diversified product mix and higher&#13;
net foreign exchange earnings through indirect export of domestically produced&#13;
inputs--will require elimination of this penalty.&#13;
Several further improvements were needed in the export-promotion&#13;
system that existed at the end of 1978. The various methods through which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
duty-free importation currently takes place tend to be either time-consuming&#13;
and burdensome (and thus tying up working capital) or too restrictive in terms&#13;
of eligibility requirements (bonded manufacturing warehouse system). Costly&#13;
paperwork and procedures required by various government agencies create&#13;
overhead expenses and delays and thus act as a disincentive for exporters.&#13;
Furthermore, the cost of the short-term export-financing facilities of the&#13;
Central Bank were high compared with the rates charged for export-financing&#13;
countries with which the Philippines competes. Many of the smaller or newly&#13;
established exporters were not aware of the existence of this export-credit&#13;
facility or are discouraged by its procedural requirements. Their access is&#13;
also limited because of the bias of the commercial banking system against&#13;
high-risk export financing for industries without an established track record.&#13;
Ideally, all manufactured export industries should be on a free-&#13;
trade regime to the maximum extent feasible. This involves: (a) duty-free&#13;
importation of raw material and components; and (b) provision of additional&#13;
assistance where necessary.   The present system is rastricted   to selected&#13;
firms in direct export manufacturing. It tends to place the smaller firms&#13;
at a disadvantage, as well as "indirect exporters," i.e., domestic suppliers&#13;
to export firms. A broader approach would need to be accompanied by improved&#13;
financing facilities for raw material and semi-finished inputs.&#13;
IV. Policies for accelerating growth&#13;
Looking to the future, Philippine industrial development will benefit&#13;
from continued and broadened expansion of manufactured exports and, in the&#13;
home industries, better utilization of capital and domestic resources, improved&#13;
job creation and training of labor and a deepening of technology. By becoming&#13;
more competitive and concentrating on branches where the Philippines has a&#13;
comparative advantage, home industries should also be able to export an&#13;
increasing share of their output, either directly or indirectly.&#13;
To realize these potentials, several steps were required. These do&#13;
not represent a break with past policies, but instead evolved from them&#13;
through adaptation to new conditions and opportunities. A lowering of pro-&#13;
tection and simplification of investment incentives were needed to improve&#13;
the performance of the home industries by increasing their competitiveness,&#13;
capital efficiency and employment effects. Changes in the various elements&#13;
of the export-incentive system were needed to solidify and broaden the manu-&#13;
factured export drive. But, however essential, changes in incentive measures&#13;
must be supplemented by related action in several other areas: credit policy,&#13;
industry-specifie planning, vocational training, technological assistance and&#13;
special measures in the regional dispersal and small industry programs.&#13;
The central ,element was a gradual but broad reduction in import&#13;
protection, evening out present differences in effective rates. Since import-&#13;
substitution policies have extended over a period of two decades or more, a&#13;
large and influential group of businesses will be affected by reducing pro-&#13;
tection. Further, as already observed, cost competitiveness and efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
in several industries will need to be improved through rehabilitation and new&#13;
investment. Thus the lowering of protection could be undertaken in isolation&#13;
but instead needed to be part of a comprehensive program of new investment&#13;
and industrial growth. Careful and detailed economic and technical studies&#13;
have already been made in preparation for the reduction of protection.&#13;
In some industries, for example, textiles and steel, reductions in&#13;
import protection will have to go hand in hand with programs to improve the&#13;
efficiency and competitiveness of the industry. But in certain simple pro-&#13;
ducer goods industries, where the Philippines' dynamic comparative advantage&#13;
is currently underutilized, protection could be increased selectively, thus,&#13;
the present low tariff in these industries would be brought closer in line&#13;
with a reduced level in the rest of the manufacturing sector.&#13;
Credit measures will have to go hand in hand with the application&#13;
of other incentive measures. The full impact of changes in industrial&#13;
policies in favor of technological development, labor-intensive production,&#13;
small industry and regional dispersion will only be realized as they are&#13;
matched by corresponding expansion of private commercial credit and the&#13;
allocation of investment credit. Technical and technological assistance&#13;
should be supplied more effectively in a way that permits individual firms&#13;
or plants to benefit. The specialized institutes, e.g., those operating in&#13;
mechanical engineering, forest products, textiles and food and nutrition,&#13;
should be in closer contact with plant operations and focus more sharply on&#13;
actual industrial practices. Their operations should also feed into the&#13;
assistance rendered under the small industry program. In addition, the&#13;
technical institutes may be instrumental in improving vocational training&#13;
in selected industries.&#13;
The reforms in the incentive system will require concerted action.&#13;
Where tariff changes are geared to specific industry conditions, they must&#13;
run parallel with the preparation and execution of programs for these&#13;
industries. These programs must, in turn, be given priority when investment&#13;
finance is allocated. Import licensing will need to be relaxed for those&#13;
items that will receive lower duties lest continued licensing makes the&#13;
tariff reduction ineffective. Export promotion will need to be backed up by&#13;
credit policies. Investment incentives would in certain cases be granted&#13;
to encourage export of part of the output from new investments, but they&#13;
would usually not be granted if the new investments required effective&#13;
protection above the level set as a general objective.&#13;
Industrial investment priorities&#13;
It is essential that the policy reforms described be accompanied by&#13;
increased investment in priority industries. Total manufacturing investment&#13;
may reach at least $12.5 billion (in 1977 prices) during the eight years&#13;
1977-1985, if the country is to accelerate output growth, expand exports and&#13;
create more jobs. This would be more than double the investment in the&#13;
previous eight years. An ordering of investment priorities makes this invest-&#13;
ment perspective more concrete, even though it must necessarily be incomplete&#13;
and tentative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Top priority should be assigned to continued expansion of labor-&#13;
intensive manufactured export industries and a broader participation in the&#13;
export drive. At present, with the notable exception of cottage industry&#13;
handicrafts, export industries are heavily concentrated in and around Manila.&#13;
Value added in manufactured export industries is a mere 25%. The greater&#13;
part of raw material inputs of most export industries is imported. Net&#13;
foreign earnings from manufactured exports are at best only 40% of gross.&#13;
Only the wood, handicraft and food processing industries rely on domestic&#13;
raw materials, and these industries should be put in a position to expand&#13;
more rapidly than others. Domestic industries should increasingly be able&#13;
to supply a larger share of the requirements of export industries. If&#13;
backward linkages are to be successfully developed, the capital efficiency&#13;
and cost levels of input-producing home industries will have to be improved&#13;
through measures discussed previously. In addition, new export product lines&#13;
will have to be introduced as the growth of older ones slows. Technological&#13;
deepening of manufactured exports with the help of the specialized institutes&#13;
and foreign investors (joint ventures) and greatly improved vocational train-&#13;
ing will--over the medium and long term--be instrumental in both increasing&#13;
the proportion of value added and the skill component and diversifying the&#13;
product mix.&#13;
The nontraditional export industries are projected to take up less&#13;
than 10% of manufacturing investment (some $1.2 billion over the period&#13;
1977-1985 in 1977 prices) even though they may create 15% of new output and&#13;
almost 40% of new employment in manufacturing. These estimates assume an&#13;
18% growth rate in labor-intensive manufactured exports.&#13;
Having equal priority with the present major export industries are&#13;
special industry programs for the footwear and furniture industries envisaged&#13;
as a component of the small industry program and small-scale weaving. The&#13;
footwear and furniture industries are labor intensive and potentially export&#13;
oriented, and the furniture industry utilized domestic raw materials. The&#13;
smaller enterprises in both industries require more technical and marketing&#13;
assistance, some improvement in equipment and help in improving domestic raw&#13;
material supplies and are suitable for more extensive regional dispersal.&#13;
The food processing industry--the largest single industry in terms&#13;
of output and employment--has a significant role to play in improving utiliza-&#13;
tion of rich domestic resources for home consumption, greater production of&#13;
nutritious low-cost foods, exports and regional (resource oriented) development.&#13;
New investments in this industry may be moderate--some $30 million in the&#13;
next few years--but substantial additional effort is needed to improve raw&#13;
material supplies. The employment-generating effect of supplying larger&#13;
quantities of agricultural materials is several times greater than that of the&#13;
processing industry itself. Export potential, assuming adequate resource&#13;
development (fruit and fisheries), is large, rising from $100 million at present&#13;
to $500 million in the mid-1980s.&#13;
Next in priority are industries where new investment or rehabilita-&#13;
tion is necessary because of their impact on output, capital efficiency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
employment creation. There is strong evidence that investment in these&#13;
industries will have a high economic return because it will make possible&#13;
considerably lower production costs and increased capital efficiency and&#13;
enable the industries to supply at least part of their output to export&#13;
industries (textiles and steel rolling), or enable the Philippines to exploit&#13;
a comparative advantage (e.g., selected projects in the mechanical engineering&#13;
industry including the foundry industry). Investment and rehabilitation in&#13;
these industries can be designed to correct conditions that at least in part&#13;
have been caused by excessive (or unduly prolonged) protection and/or&#13;
excessive finance, or relative neglect by the incentive system (e.g., the&#13;
producer goods industry).&#13;
Some of the points of particular interest in the industry programs&#13;
in this category of priority may be mentioned briefly here:&#13;
(a) The textile industry rehabilitation program (approximately $250&#13;
million). About half the industry is reasonably efficient, but&#13;
the rest suffers from obsolescent machinery and can at present&#13;
survive only as a result of high protection (50-70% nominal,&#13;
over 100% effective protection). Rehabilitation would be combined&#13;
with increased product specialization and would reduce costs and&#13;
improve utilization of capacity. Some of the new output could&#13;
be exported--in fact, some export could be a condition for&#13;
receiving investment incentives and finance. The program would&#13;
go hand in hand with a lowering of protection.&#13;
(b) The steel rolling industry. A number of rolling mills,&#13;
particularly the larger and newer ones, can be operated&#13;
economically. Some mills require modernization and rounding&#13;
out of an investment (approximately $100 million) would expand&#13;
the capacity of National Steel's cold rolling mill to its&#13;
ultimate potential of 700,000 tons per year, almost four&#13;
times its present level. This investment would permit the&#13;
company to increase productivity, lower costs of production,&#13;
and ultimately to lower prices--hence make possible lower&#13;
protection--and still obtain an economic return;&#13;
(c) The mechanical engineering industry. In the interest of&#13;
efficient longer-run development, producer goods should&#13;
receive greater incentives from the Government, including&#13;
more technical assistance and long-term investment finance.&#13;
New investment or expansion in the producer goods subsector&#13;
could amount to $100 million in the next few years. Areas&#13;
of immediate opportunities could be mining and material&#13;
handling equipment. Foundries, fabrication shops and&#13;
machine shops require new tooling;&#13;
(d) The cement industry. A rehabilitation program is needed to&#13;
restore run-down facilities. It would also include improve-&#13;
ments in pollution control and have a coal conversion component.&#13;
The program could require an outlay of some $130 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Finally, there are several capital-intensive industries deserving&#13;
attention in the next 5-10 years. Among these are cement expansion (some&#13;
$1 billion to be carried out in stages) and integrated steel (at least $1.3&#13;
billion). The proposed integrated steel project would ensure a more reliable&#13;
supply of steel to Philippine industry over a period when steel-using branches&#13;
will gain importance.&#13;
The large investment in steel should be compared with other high&#13;
priority claims in infrastructure, agriculture and other branches of manu-&#13;
facturing. Investment in these other areas would not necessarily come at&#13;
the expense of steel and vice versa, but a balance must be struck among&#13;
competing priority claims lest the efforts of continued manufactured export&#13;
growth and necessary industrial rehabilitation fail. The steel investment&#13;
would initially require an outlay about equal to the total annual capital&#13;
expenditure of the Government (10 billion pesos in fiscal year 1978). Within&#13;
the industrial sector, the steel investment can be compared with the total&#13;
investment in non-traditional manufactured exports of some $1.2 billion in&#13;
the period 1977-1985, which is projected to create new jobs for 360,000 workers&#13;
and net additional foreign exchange earnings of at least $1 billion per year&#13;
by 1985. The steel investment is more than three times as large as the&#13;
combined outlays required for the rehabilitation of the textile and cement&#13;
industries.&#13;
The benefits of rehabilitation and investment&#13;
The policy and investment measures described above are designed to&#13;
help the Philippines make better use of its comparative advantage and its&#13;
capital, labor and raw material resources. The pay off on these measures can&#13;
be considerable in terms of increased exports, employment and total output&#13;
growth. On the other hand, the cost of not taking the measures could be&#13;
very high, especially in terms of employment opportunities foregone.&#13;
Broadening support for manufactured exports would enable the&#13;
Philippines to utilize its cost and productivity advantages and make possible&#13;
a growth rate of labor-Lntensive manufactured exports of at least 18% per&#13;
annum. While this repriesents some slowdown, export growth now proceeds from&#13;
a much larger base. In fact, total non-traditional manufactured exports may&#13;
exceed $3 billion in the mid-1980s, assuming that the growth of industrial&#13;
countries will not fall significantly below 4% per annum in the next decade.&#13;
Conditions in customer markets are constrained by protectionist attitudes,&#13;
but for many Philippine products quotas have not yet been filled. Considerable&#13;
opportunities exist for developing new and higher-quality items and breaking&#13;
into new markets.&#13;
Further, the measures outlined would make possible a broader partici-&#13;
pation in export growth in several respects: more and smaller firms, greater&#13;
regional dispersal of export production, new product and market development,&#13;
increased skills, and a greater share of inputs to be procured at home. They&#13;
should thus also help in increasing the proportion of value added in nontraditional&#13;
manufactured exports ancl the net foreign exchange earnings from them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Export growth alone will not be sufficient to improve the performance&#13;
of the manufacturing sector. Increasing the rate of growth and the capital&#13;
efficiency of home industries is essential, since they now account for 85%&#13;
of manufacturing output and employment. Several of the measures discussed, in&#13;
particular, lowering of protection, greater emphasis on labor-intensive&#13;
industries in the administration of investment incentives and special invest-&#13;
ment programs for strategically placed industries, would improve home industry&#13;
performance. The small industry and regional diversification programs would&#13;
help in spreading the benefits of industrial growth. A shift towards more&#13;
labor-intensive investment would be in line with Philippine comparative&#13;
advantage and the overriding need for providing productive jobs. This will&#13;
involve, among others, placing greater stress on promising small and labor-&#13;
intensive industries and developing the mechanical engineering industry.&#13;
Continued growth in labor-intensive manufactured exports and greater&#13;
attention to employment effects of home industry investment would bring about&#13;
dynamic changes in the composition of manufacturing employment and its contri-&#13;
bution to creating jobs in the economy. Moreover, as the domestic industry&#13;
becomes a more efficient producer of intermediate inputs, the linkages between&#13;
the export sector and the domestic economy can be strengthened. Manufacturing&#13;
growth will also contribute very substantially to employment in the service&#13;
sector (transportation, finance, procurement, marke-ing) and the construction&#13;
industry.&#13;
Improved capital utilization at home and continued export expansion&#13;
should make possible an acceleration in manufacturing growth to at least 8%.&#13;
Employment growth in manufacturing would triple, and the direct contribution&#13;
of manufacturing to the increase in total national employment would rise from&#13;
10% in the period 1970-77 to 20% in the period 1977-1985. In all, the manu-&#13;
facturing sector would account for close to one million new jobs during the&#13;
period 1977-1985, growing at an annual rate of 5.9% or about twice its&#13;
historic rate. This improvement would come about even though the large&#13;
cottage sector would grow only very little. The export industries would&#13;
contribute 46% of all new employment in manufacturing (see Table 11).&#13;
These employment projections imply a decrease in the capital-labor&#13;
ratio from $30,000 (1970-1977) per job to $20,000 (1977-1985) per job in home&#13;
industries and an increase in the employment elasticity of manufacturing&#13;
output from 0.32 to 0.57 in the two periods. Such changes can be expected from&#13;
continued export expansion, and to employment effects and capital efficiency&#13;
in investment decisions.&#13;
In the absence of the various policy measures, the employment&#13;
elasticity would not improve and output growth might likewise be lower--&#13;
say, at the 6% of recent years or less instead of the 8% assumed earlier.&#13;
This would mean that employment in home industries would continue to increase&#13;
by only 1.9% (instead of 4.2%) reaching 1.6 million in 1985 (instead of&#13;
1.9 million). If, in addition, nontraditional exports were to increase at&#13;
a slower pace--say, by 12% foreseen for all developing countries--the cost in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
terms of jobs lost would be another 160,000 jobs per year by 1985. In total,&#13;
the loss in new jobs resulting from slower growth and greater capital intensi.y&#13;
would be 450,000-500,000 jobs by 1985 (see Table 12).&#13;
The projected changes in employment are not out of line with those&#13;
observed in other countries in the region. The Philippines' projected growth&#13;
in manufacturing employment of 5.9% per annum for the period 1977-1985 is&#13;
less than what was achieved by Malaysia (6.6% per annum, starting from a low&#13;
base) and the Republic of Korea (15.2% per annum) over the period 1970-1975.&#13;
In the Republic of Korea, in 1969-1970, manufactured exports contributed 38%&#13;
to employment growth in manufacturing and 33% in the economy (including&#13;
indirect employment generation); in 1970, exports accounted for one quarter&#13;
of manufacturing employment. As manufactured exports became more important&#13;
in the Republic of Korea, the cottage sector also declined in relative&#13;
importance.&#13;
V. Concluding remarks&#13;
This paper supports a broad concept of the incentive system.&#13;
Although the analysis is focussed on protection, fiscal incentives and&#13;
export-promotion measures, they must be supplemented and supported by&#13;
several other elements of industrial policy, especially credit allocation,&#13;
technical assistance and investment. Neither analysis nor policy can be&#13;
complete if industry-specific planning and investment (and the associated&#13;
strengthening of institutions) are not brought into the picture.&#13;
In the industrial strategy described, vigorous manufactured export&#13;
growth is placed first, both because of its essential contribution to output&#13;
growth and a viable balance of payments to new employment in the manufacturing&#13;
sector (close to one-half of new jobs provided by the sector in the next&#13;
decade). The estimates of future growth are illustrative, while they may&#13;
appear high, they are moderate in comparison with the achievement of some&#13;
other countries in the Pacific Region and well within the potential of the&#13;
Philippines. An export growth strategy can be successful in an expanding and&#13;
"open" international environment and in countries with a reasonably low-cost&#13;
and well-trained labor supply and relatively free entry of capable entre-&#13;
preneurs (both indigenous and foreign) into the export sector. While the&#13;
Philippines meets these conditions, a genuine concern exists that export&#13;
growth may be frustrated by protectionism and economic constraints in the&#13;
industrial countries. Consequently, emphasis should be placed on strengthening&#13;
the competitiveness and the productive and technological capacity of both&#13;
the home and export industries. Without broad-based industrial and techno-&#13;
logical development, the export effort will make only a shallow contribution&#13;
to longer-term growth. The policies recommended are needed not merely in the&#13;
interest of manufactured export growth but, more broadly, of efficient&#13;
resource utilization for longer-term development of the entire manufacturing&#13;
sector.&#13;
Export growth can initially be achieved despite the well-entrenched&#13;
position of import substitution industries receiving high protection. Parallel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
with the export-promotion effort, attention is being given to the moderniza-&#13;
tion, rehabilitation and restructuring of home industry, by far the more&#13;
important sector in terms of output and employment. It holds the key to&#13;
increasing capital efficiency and investment returns in the economy. It&#13;
includes the more capital-intensive industries that are needed to assure&#13;
a reliable supply of intermediate goods and industrial raw materials at&#13;
economic prices. Simplification of investment incentives and reduction in&#13;
protection, greater emphasis on the utilization of comparative advantage&#13;
and domestic resources and on job creation are essential ingredients of&#13;
industrial policy. A move towards greater freedom in trade and industrial&#13;
policies must be part of a more comprehensive program of industrial development.&#13;
The manufacturing sector, through emphasis on labor-intensive&#13;
industries, plays an essential role in employment policy. Other sectors are&#13;
more important in employment creation, especially services, construction and&#13;
rural reform. But manufacturing can often make a more important contribution&#13;
than it has made in the past, and the secondary effects are often a multiple&#13;
of the direct effects. For the poorer of the population groups, industry can&#13;
lead the way to higher incomes, since its jobs are productive and rewarding.&#13;
It plays a key role in improving the economic prospects of outlying regions&#13;
and small cities. Industrial incentives can be designed to accelerate&#13;
geographic dispersion. The cottage industries, very important but with a&#13;
sluggish record overall, need special attention focussed on their more dynamic&#13;
components, lest incomes in this sector fall too far behind the rest of the&#13;
economy.&#13;
Many opportunities exist to increase the links between manufacturing&#13;
and the rest of the economy and between industrial and other aspects of&#13;
development policy. Improved job training, often industry-specific and&#13;
sponsored by industrial associations or institutes, is a key element in enhanc-&#13;
ing value added and sophistication of production and design. In the crucial&#13;
food processing industries, greater agricultural supplies are essential,&#13;
including supplies from small farmers to help avoid excessive concentration&#13;
in the industry. Export industries can obtain domestically an increasing&#13;
share of their needs as home industry efficiency improves. Regional dispersion&#13;
may also be instrumental in making possible greater access to indigenous&#13;
raw materials and skills.&#13;

/c  The capital-labor ratio (Kb/N) described above is based on book value of fixed assets which&#13;
has considerable difference with replacement cost of fixed assets (Kr) as described in foot-&#13;
note /a of Table 3.5.   The Kb is used in the Annual Suzvey of Establishments and does not&#13;
account for price distortions, utile the Kr requires some data manipulation to account for&#13;
price distortions and equipment life. The Kb for all industries, for instance, is US$2,734,&#13;
while the Kr is USS11,207, which represents a more realistic cost per job for the industry&#13;
as a vhole.&#13;

            Transition toward more rapid and
            labor-intensive industrial development : the case of the Philippines
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper focuses on the ways in which
            home industries can expand along lines of comparative
            advantage, improving their efficiency and utilization of
            domestic resources, capital and labor. It also considers the
            possibilities and requirements of continued growth of export
            industries and their integration with the domestic economy.
            The paper supports a broad concept of incentive policies,
            concentrating on measures to reduce protection and make
            fiscal investment incentives and export promotion more
            effective. A main theme of the paper is that policy reform
            to be effective must be part of a comprehensive program for
            industrial development, including also technological
            deepening, credit allocation, strengthening of key
            institutions, industry-specific planning and investment. The
            Philippines has been treated as a case study of policy
            adaptation and industrial planning; it has several
            characteristics giving its experience wide applicability,
            including availability of low-cost productive labor, a
            moderately sized market making integration with the world
            economy essential, improved manufactured export performance
            needed to achieve longer-run balance of payments viability,
            strong interest in overcoming regional disparities and
            establishing balance between labor-intensive and c
