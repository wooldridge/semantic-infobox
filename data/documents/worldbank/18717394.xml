ï»¿ANNEX III&#13;
Standard Provisions Applicable to the Multi-donor Trust Fund for the Co-financing of&#13;
the Ethiopia Promoting Basic Services Phase III Project&#13;
(PBS3 Co-financing Trust Fund)&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between&#13;
the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles&#13;
of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies,&#13;
its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the&#13;
use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank&#13;
under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an&#13;
individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee,&#13;
has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;
complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear&#13;
any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;
trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall transfer all income from such investment to the&#13;
Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each instalment, an&#13;
amount equal to one percent (1%) per instalment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management&#13;
and Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as&#13;
an administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on&#13;
an actual basis up to a maximum of zero point one four percent (0.14%) of the total Contributions&#13;
under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3. 3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the&#13;
first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change,&#13;
the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;
which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and&#13;
which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments&#13;
to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration&#13;
Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited&#13;
in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments&#13;
and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final&#13;
financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency&#13;
with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust&#13;
Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit&#13;
report, comprising: (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external&#13;
auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-&#13;
based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall&#13;
arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank&#13;
with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5    The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;

5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six&#13;
(6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope&#13;
and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within&#13;
the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs&#13;
incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation&#13;
will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement: Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
June 30, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after&#13;
such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall&#13;
return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner&#13;
specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all&#13;
Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all&#13;
or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid&#13;
and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank&#13;
and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement,&#13;
including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the&#13;
Bank shall return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by&#13;
each such Donor in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such&#13;
uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional terms that may be agreed&#13;
between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust&#13;
Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
