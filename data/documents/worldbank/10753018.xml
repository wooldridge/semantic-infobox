            Africa - Regional Communications
            Infrastructure Program Third Adaptable Program Loan :
            Mozambique eGovernment and Communications Infrastructure Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Mozambique
            eGovernment and Communications Infrastructure Project
            (MEGCIP), part of the third phase of the Regional
            Infrastructure Program in Africa is to support the
            Recipient's efforts to contribute to lower prices for
            international capacity and extend the geographic reach of
            broadband networks and to contribute to improved efficiency
            and transparency through eGovernment applications. There are
            four components to the project. The first component of the
            project is enabling environment. This component will provide
            technical capacity building and advice to the key agencies
            of government having a direct role in the project. The
            second component of the project is connectivity. This
            component will include financing for connectivity in
            Mozambique through several subcomponents: (a) financing for
            the establishment or strengthening of the existing Internet
            Exchange Point (IXP) through technical assistance and
            purchase of equipment; (b) financing for equipment for the
            Governments' communications network; and (c) financing
            for equipment for the setup of the Mozambique Research and
            Education Network (MoRENet). The third component of the
            project is eGovernement applications. This component
            supports the Government of Mozambique's strategic
            flagship program identified in the national eGovernment
            strategy, prepared in 2006. The fourth and final component
            of the project is project management support. This component
            will consist of financing for project management related
            issues covering staff salaries, technical assistance,
            equipment and operating costs, and namely support for hiring
            key staff such as: (i) a project coordinator based at
            Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT); (ii) an Ministry
            of Transport and Communication (MTC) advisor to be staffed
            at the MTC; (iii) a lead Information technology (IT)
            architect, and as a minimum; (iii) one procurement manager;
            (iv) one financial management specialist; (v) a monitoring
            and evaluation specialist; (vi) a communications specialist;
            and (vii) environmental expertise as required.
