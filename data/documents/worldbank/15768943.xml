Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) have been explored in                                       Information gathered for these projects is based on&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s urban water supply services since the 1990s. Several                                   primary and secondary data. Primary information on&#13;
projects have been attempted with varying roles and extent of                                  these projects, and the sector as a whole, was collected on&#13;
participation envisaged for the private sector. These attempts                                 the basis of consultations with government and private&#13;

projects. This review involves a study of PPPs in the urban&#13;
water supply sector since the 1990s, to determine the trends                                   Emerging Trends in the&#13;
emerging in the sector, and to analyze the factors that have                                   Indian Urban Water Supply PPP&#13;
facilitated or impeded the development and implementation                                      The emerging trends from PPP projects in the urban water&#13;
of PPPs in the sector.                                                                         supply services since the 1990s are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Further, the study analyzes the direction in which the sector                                  Increase in the Number of PPP Projects Reaching&#13;
is heading with respect to private sector participation. Since                                 Contract Award Stage&#13;
most PPPs are at early stages of operation, this study focuses                                 Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the number&#13;
only on learnings from PPP design and transaction. This study                                  of PPP projects initiated or awarded. The proportion of&#13;
does not seek to assess the operating or financial performance                                 projects successfully awarded has also increased. Only four&#13;
of PPPs.                                                                                       PPP projects were awarded till 2004. Since 2005, 13 projects&#13;

Over the years, there has been a shift in the geographic                  Most water supply PPP projects during the 1990s were&#13;
concentration of water PPPs in the country, with a broadening             aimed at augmentation of the bulk water supply system.&#13;

sector. The PPP projects which were developed and planned                 projects decreased during the early part of the 2000 decade.&#13;
during the 1990s were largely concentrated in the southern                Among the PPP attempts during this time, 80 percent of&#13;
states of the country such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and                  the projects were attempted to bring in the private sector for&#13;
Andhra Pradesh. Since 2000, this trend has changed to                     operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) improvements of the&#13;

2004, projects were being proposed for implementation in                  large-scale PPP attempts at bulk water supply augmentation,&#13;
the states of Karnataka, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Andhra                   state governments and international funding agencies now&#13;

lead in terms of the number of projects being implemented,                emulate the operational efficiencies of the private sector.&#13;
the tally now also includes states where, so far, water PPP&#13;
projects had not been undertaken. Among these are Madhya                  Today, approximately 60 percent of the PPP projects address&#13;

cross-section of states/cities to initiate projects on their own.         O&amp;M of the entire water supply system.&#13;
At an overall level, successful experiences with PPP in various&#13;
infrastructure projects have also prompted more states/cities             Further, the type of PPP arrangements being implemented&#13;
to explore PPP models.                                                    has also changed. During the 1990s, the majority of the&#13;

    (BOT) models with 100 percent private financing.                          support extended by the government.&#13;
    This changed to a scenario in the early 2000s when the majority&#13;
    of O&amp;M improvements were sought through management                        While the availability of public funding has helped increase&#13;

     The role of the central government with respect to urban                              Unlike several other infrastructure sectors in the country&#13;
     water supply is limited to defining performance norms for                             such as telecom or power, the urban water supply sector does&#13;

     Development (MoUD) is the nodal ministry responsible                                  focusing mainly on water resources management. Formed&#13;

  box 3.1: 74th ConStitUtionAL Amendment ACt, 1992&#13;
&#13;
  Prior to 1992, the Constitution of India did not make local self governments in the urban area a direct constitutional&#13;
  obligation. As a consequence of inadequate Constitutional provision for local self governments, municipal governance&#13;
  in the country was unstable resulting in many ULBs becoming weak and ineffective.&#13;
&#13;
  As part of its efforts to decentralize and strengthen the system of governance, GoI, in 1992, passed the 74th CAA. This Act&#13;
  essentially attempted to strengthen local governments in the urban areas with greater power and authority to effectively&#13;
  discharge the duties accorded to them. The 12th Schedule of the 74th CAA lists a set of obligatory and discretionary&#13;
  functions which are to be performed by the ULBs along with their planning, regulation, and development powers.&#13;
  Among the obligatory functions devolved to the ULBs was that of â&#128;&#156;water supply for domestic, industrial, and commercial&#13;
  purposesâ&#128;?. With the passing of this Act, the onus of provision of water supply services in the urban areas of India rests&#13;
  with the respective local governments, that is, the ULBs. In some states in India, the devolution of powers in the context&#13;
  of the 74th CAA has been undertaken while in others this process is currently underway.&#13;

institutional and other mechanisms which facilitate                       need to encourage private sector participation to improve&#13;
implementation of the policy. In India, at the national level,            service delivery:&#13;
the country has a National Water Policy (NWP). Other than&#13;
this, at the level of the GoI, no policy has been introduced                    Private sector participation should be encouraged in&#13;

development, good governance, and basic services to the poor                           from past forms of public funding in a couple of ways. Firstly,&#13;
in urban areas of the country. Sectors covered under these                             JNNURM provided partial funding. Therefore, cities had to&#13;

&amp;#12;     Trends in Private Sector Participation in the Indian Water Sector   A Critical Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Evolution of PPP Projects in 1990s                                        The projects developed during this phase shifted focus from&#13;
     During the 1990s, the PPP initiatives in the urban water                  bulk water supply augmentation to O&amp;M improvements&#13;
     supply sector were set against the backdrop of economic                   in the distribution system. In line with this shift, the type&#13;
     liberalization. A larger private sector role was envisaged                of PPP arrangement developed also changed with increased&#13;
     across infrastructure sectors. Private investments in electricity         exploration of the management contract model. For the&#13;
     generation were being pursued vigorously.                                 PPP arrangements involving O&amp;M improvements, financial&#13;
                                                                               assistance was envisaged from the respective state governments&#13;
     The period also saw continued stress on the water supply                  or from international funding agencies such as the World&#13;
     infrastructure with rising demand due to increased                        Bank. Feedback collected during discussions with government&#13;
     urbanization. The state and city level water supply utilities             officials and sector experts suggests that, learning from the&#13;
     were facing the multiple challenges of poor service delivery,             failure of the earlier large-scale PPP attempts at bulk water&#13;
     low coverage, and limited financial resources to undertake                supply augmentation, state governments and international&#13;
     large-scale capital investments.                                          funding agencies now encouraged the management&#13;
                                                                               contract model to emulate the managerial efficiencies of the&#13;
     In this context, five major PPP initiatives were attempted in             private sector.&#13;
     the urban water supply sector. Most of these initiatives were&#13;
     bulk water supply augmentation projects designed under the                It is understood from stakeholders engaged in a few of these&#13;
     BOT model. On an average, the estimated cost of the projects              projects that extensive preparatory activities were undertaken,&#13;
     initiated during this time period was INR 4.700 billion.                  such as baseline data verification, development of a capital&#13;
     These projects were developed under a PPP arrangement that                refurbishment plan, and so on, to ensure development of a&#13;
     was dependant on substantial private financing. Innovative                well structured PPP contract. The projects developed during&#13;
     mechanisms of private financing, hitherto not experimented                this phase continued to attract the interest of international&#13;
     with in the urban water supply sector, were also attempted,               private water operators.&#13;
     such as the formation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for&#13;
     project development and implementation.                                   Despite these efforts, contracts were awarded for only three&#13;
                                                                               projects of the eight planned. Among these, two were bulk&#13;
     These PPP projects also attracted substantial international               water augmentation/treatment projects and one an O&amp;M&#13;
     private operator interest. International private water supply             improvement project. Of these, only two are currently&#13;
     operators such as Bi Water, Veolia Water, Suez Environment,               operational, that is, the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Sonia&#13;
     Anglian Water, and so on, exhibited interest in the                       Vihar, New Delhi, and the O&amp;M contract in Chandrapur,&#13;
     development and implementation of PPP projects.                           Maharashtra. All the other projects were abandoned at the&#13;

     Despite extensive preparatory activities and international                for failure was the strong local stakeholder opposition to these&#13;
     interest, of the five projects, contracts were awarded for                projects, including resistance from employees of the public&#13;
     only the Tirupur Industrial Water Supply Project, which is                water utilities and from civil society groups. Involvement&#13;

     different stages of project development. These projects failed            services was largely perceived as a move towards privatization&#13;
     on account of issues related to weak risk mitigation measures             of water supply services, with apprehensions about steep&#13;
     in the contractual structures, inconsistent political support,            increase in water tariffs. Failures/controversies associated with&#13;
     and procurement issues. A detailed chronology of these                    some large concession contracts in Latin America and East&#13;

for implementation in the states of Karnataka, Delhi,                     with PPP models in various sectors has prompted more states&#13;

in South India continue to lead in terms of the number of&#13;
projects being implemented, the tally now also includes states            This shift in the geographic distribution of projects is shown&#13;
where, so far, water PPP projects had not been undertaken.                in Figure 4.4. From this, it is reasonable to infer that PPP&#13;
Among these are Madhya Pradesh where three projects are                   activity is becoming increasingly broad-based across the&#13;

     Most of the water supply PPP projects during the 1990s                    at 24x7 water supply. Since public agencies did not have the&#13;

     However, this predominance of bulk water supply PPP                       sought in the implementation of these projects. The focus&#13;

     were attempted during this period, a contract was awarded                 During the 1990s, a majority of the projects were primarily&#13;
     for only one such project. Today, approximately 60 percent                BOT models with 100 percent private financing. In early&#13;
     of the PPP projects are focused on improvements of the                    2000s, this changed to a scenario when the majority of O&amp;M&#13;
     distribution system while 30 percent are aimed at bulk water              improvements were sought through management contract-&#13;
     supply augmentation. The remaining projects include both                  based interventions. Today, the operational contracts see a mix&#13;
     bulk water supply augmentation and O&amp;M of the entire                      of BOT and management contracts. There are variations in&#13;

Interestingly, over the years, there has also been a decline              However, since 2005, most water PPP projects are being&#13;
in the time taken between project initiation and the award                developed by the project sponsoring authority itself, that is,&#13;
of contract. For instance, in the case of projects initiated              ULBs and state departments. For instance, the PPP projects&#13;
prior to 2000, the average time to reach the contract award               developed in Latur, Salt Lake City, Khandwa, Shivpuri, Naya&#13;
stage was four years. As against this, for the PPP projects               Raipur, and so on, have been initiated and developed by the&#13;
developed 2005 onward, the time taken has been two-and-                   respective state departments or the ULBs.&#13;
a-half years on an average. The reduced private investment&#13;
component and absence of tariff implications could be                     Increased Share of Public Financing in&#13;
one of the factors contributing to a shorter project                      PPP Projects&#13;

Reduced Reliance on Multilateral Agencies for                             projects would attract a significant amount of private&#13;
PPP Project Development                                                   investment. Projects developed during the 1990s and early&#13;
An assessment of project initiation and development process               2000s were accordingly based on a PPP structure which&#13;
indicates a steady decline in reliance on multilateral agencies           had limited dependence on public financing. The Pune&#13;
for PPP-based project development and implementation.                     Water Supply PPP project was the only exception to this.&#13;
During the 1990s, several projects were driven by strong                  It was proposed to be developed with a significant amount&#13;
advocacy from multilateral funding agencies to develop                    of funding from the project sponsoring authority, that is,&#13;
water projects on a PPP basis. Even during the early years                Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). All the other PPP&#13;
of the 2000 decade, project development was largely driven                projects expected the private operator to arrange finances.&#13;
by financial assistance available from multilateral funding               This trend has changed in the recent past, with most urban&#13;
agencies to meet the capital costs. This was the case in                  water supply PPP projects being developed on the basis of&#13;
projects proposed for Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru.                       availability of substantial public funding.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Trends in Private Sector Participation in the Indian Water Sector                   A Critical Review&#13;

     With several of the first wave of PPP attempts failing to                                   The increased and changed form of public funding has thus&#13;
     take off, the expectations from the private sector have also                                had two benefits: a) it has pushed cities to choose PPP; and&#13;
     changed over a period of time. Government funding through                                   b) it has helped lower the cost of PPP. Till such time the risk&#13;
     own sources and by way of schemes such as the JNNURM                                        perceptions regarding water PPPs in India continue to remain&#13;
     and UIDSSMT are being relied upon extensively for the                                       high, the share of private investment will continue to be&#13;
     development of water supply PPP projects. At present, 50                                    relatively small, with substantial reliance on public funding.&#13;
     percent of the ongoing projects have been developed under                                   Moreover, given the weak financial health of ULBs, most of&#13;
     financial support extended by the government; 75 percent of                                 this public funding would need to come from state/central&#13;
     these projects have received funding support from the central                               government sources.&#13;
     government-sponsored JNNURM and UIDSSMT schemes&#13;
     (Table 4.6). The share of public funding in these projects                                  Shift in Private operator Mix&#13;
     ranges from 35 percent of planned investment (in the Salt                                   The private operator mix in the Indian water supply PPP&#13;
     Lake City project) to 90 percent of planned investment (in                                  projects has changed since the 1990s, when the projects&#13;
     Shivpuri and Khandwa). Actual share of public funding has                                   were dominated by international private operators. These&#13;
     been lower, since cost escalations were not covered under                                   operators viewed India as an emerging market due to the&#13;
     public funding. While availability of public funding has                                    immense challenges faced by the urban water supply sector&#13;
     helped increase the viability of private sector participation, the                          and the scale of projects developed by public water utilities&#13;
     structure and process of JNNURM funding has itself created                                  in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This phenomenon was also in&#13;
     an impetus for adoption of private sector participation. To the                             line with the international trend of increasing involvement&#13;
     extent ULBs are required to contribute a share of the project                               of international operators in PPP projects in other&#13;

     ULBs and project initiating authorities to explore PPP models                               The international operators who were active in the Indian&#13;
     more aggressively than in the past.                                                         market during this period included Anglian Water, Veolia&#13;

     Over the years, there has also been a shift in the international                             Furthermore, in several of the ongoing projects, private&#13;
     operators who have been interested in the Indian water supply                                operators have participated in the bid process by forming joint&#13;
     PPP market. For instance, during the 1990s, the international                                ventures or consortiums with other operators. The technical&#13;
     private operator scene was dominated by UK-based operators                                   qualification criteria required in the bid documents usually&#13;
     such as Bi Water, Thames Water, and Anglian Water, and                                       make it necessary for the domestic operator to enter into&#13;
     French operators such as Suez Environment and Veolia Water.                                  agreements with a local or international private operator.&#13;
     Today, however, there is limited participation from UK-based                                 Similarly, international operators very often tie up with Indian&#13;
     operators. This is also in line with the international trend as                              firms while bidding for water supply PPP projects.&#13;

     Sector experts suggest that several of the earlier attempts at            has been partly because several of the initial PPPs were&#13;
     PPPs failed due to limited understanding, awareness, and                  attempted in large cities, especially in standalone utilities,&#13;

     of the lack of experience in developing water PPPs, BWSSB,                their institutional structure, size, and technical and financial&#13;
     HMWSSB, and the Goa PWD had hired experts to assess                       capacity. However, despite these seemingly favorable factors,&#13;
     the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed projects          stakeholder opposition often tended to be amplified in&#13;

     For instance, in the case of the Cauvery Bulk Water Supply                cities, where media pressure and stakeholder opposition&#13;
     Project, during the procurement phase, the public water                   are comparatively lower, and project champions more&#13;
     utilities required the private operators to sign raw water                empowered, PPP arrangements may enjoy a greater&#13;
     purchase agreements. These were to be signed without                      chance of success. Possible instances of this could be&#13;
     providing adequate clarity or information on the costs of raw             Shivpuri and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, which are&#13;
     water purchase, which would have resulted in the bids being               discussed later.&#13;

     relating to the project, the private operators had to bear                5.3 Analysis of Successful Projects&#13;

     Water PPP projects have also suffered due to lack of                      outcomes. In addition, given that most of these contracts&#13;

     Availability of Public Funding                                            are, however, transferred to the ULB. In case of default in&#13;
     Unlike in the case of several failed projects, where substantial          payment of water charges by the consumers, 50 percent of&#13;
     private financing was expected, successful water PPPs are                 the connection charge collected from the consumer is to be&#13;
     backed strongly by public funding. Funds from central                     paid to the private operator. Further, the private operators&#13;
     government-sponsored schemes, JNNURM and UIDSSMT,                         have been authorized to disconnect defaulting connections&#13;
     have addressed approximately 60-70 percent of the final                   and are also permitted to escalate the tariff by 10 percent&#13;
     project costs (and up to 90 percent of the initially approved             every three years.&#13;
     costs). In the past, even though grant funding was available,&#13;
     grants could be used only if projects were implemented using              In the Salt Lake City project, the private operator is permitted&#13;
     the public procurement route. Under JNNURM and earlier,                   to retain the one-time connection fee, and escalate the tariff&#13;
     under KUWASIP, public funds were made available to pursue                 by 10 percent every three years. In the Haldia project, the&#13;
     PPP approaches as well. This ensured that the projects could              private operator is allowed to sell surplus treated water and&#13;
     be structured in a way that payments by the public body                   share the revenues in the ratio of 50:50 with the Haldia&#13;
     were assured to the operators. Examples of such an approach               Development Authority (HDA). In case of the Mysore&#13;
     are Mysore and Naya Raipur. Even in instances where the                   contract, construction cost overruns up to 1.10 times the&#13;
     operators relied on revenue collection from customers, public             original tender cost would be reimbursed by the Mysore City&#13;
     funding enabled the tariffs to be maintained at affordable                Corporation (MCC) in addition to the electricity costs which&#13;
     levels. Salt Lake City in Kolkata, Shivpuri, and Khandwa                  would be borne by MCC.&#13;
     are examples of such an approach. In the KUWASIP and&#13;
     Latur PPP arrangements, the capital investment needs                      In the Chandrapur project, the private operator was&#13;

     from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaranâ&#128;&#153;s (MJPâ&#128;&#153;s) own                         and maintenance. Further, the O&amp;M responsibility of the&#13;
     resources, respectively.                                                  project fully rested with the private operator. Given this,&#13;
                                                                               it was anticipated that the returns on investments made&#13;
     Today, there is a growing realization that the private sector             by the private operator would be low in the initial years of&#13;
     cannot be expected to fund substantial capital investment                 the contract. Accordingly, the private operator was given&#13;
     needs. Given the prevailing low water tariff levels and the high          the flexibility to determine the quantum of the yearly lease&#13;
     capital requirement for refurbishment and expansion, water                payment made to Chandrapur Municipal Council (CMC)&#13;
     PPPs are not commercially viable yet. Therefore, a viability              over the contract period.&#13;
     gap mechanism in the form of grants is necessary to promote&#13;
                                                                               The KUWASIP projectâ&#128;&#148;the first among the projects in this&#13;

     Tariff Concerns&#13;
     In several projects, measures have been incorporated to                   As is evident from the above, increased flexibility in the&#13;

     security mechanism has been developed to cover the revenue                mechanisms helped address one of the key concerns of&#13;

In the case of several projects where contracts have                      The exception to this was in the case of Latur where the&#13;

stakeholder willingness to explore the option of private                  Information Education and Communication (IEC) efforts&#13;
sector participation. For instance, prior to the project,                 by the public water utility. Though it has been acknowledged&#13;
Chandrapur was facing high year-on-year losses in water                   earlier that an elaborate stakeholder consultation process does&#13;

sustain the financial losses and did not have the capacity                lifecycle, its absence increases the likelihood of failure,&#13;
to improve efficiency, it was thought prudent to engage                   especially in projects focusing on O&amp;M improvements.&#13;
the private sector to effectively manage the water supply&#13;
operations. In this context, stakeholder buy-in for the project           Strong Project Ownership and Expertise&#13;
was also forthcoming more easily.                                         Several of these successful projects have been developed due&#13;
                                                                          to consistent efforts by the project initiating authority and&#13;
Similarly, prior to the project, Khandwa and Shivpuri faced               availability of sound project expertise with the authority&#13;
severe water supply problems. Due to inadequate and unreliable            (often a state agency). In the case of the KUWASIP project,&#13;
supply, large sections of the population were dependant on                the state infrastructure financing departmentâ&#128;&#148;KUIDFCâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
private water tankers. In such a context, the proposal by the             played an active role in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s conceptualization,&#13;
state Urban Administration and Development Department                     development and implementation, including preparatory&#13;
(UADD) to engage the private sector was met with greater                  studies, stakeholder consultations, development of the project&#13;
acceptance by the stakeholders. Similarly, the projects in Salt           structure, contract terms, bid process management, and&#13;
Lake City, Haldia, and Chennai were undertaken against a                  oversight of implementation.&#13;
backdrop of perceived need for intervention.&#13;
&#13;
The other factor contributing to increased stakeholder support            Similarly, in the projects recently awarded for Khandwa and&#13;
was the extensive consultation undertaken during the entire               Shivpuri, UADD of the Government of Madhya Pradesh took&#13;

nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to create awareness                    concerned government departments/agencies is in sharp&#13;

     preparation of draft bidding documents, and a few successful              increased domestic operator interest. Though the project&#13;
     projects did not have an external transaction advisor.                    went through stakeholder opposition, it stimulated domestic&#13;

     domestic operators and also regional and local players.                   project was implemented on PPP. These two factors were a&#13;
     In a majority of successful contract awards, the domestic                 significant departure from earlier funding programs which:&#13;
     operators have exhibited a high risk-taking appetite, possibly            a) provided almost 100 percent funding; and b) emphasized&#13;

     Failures were more common in the early stages of water                    cities to consider the PPP option and it also lowered the&#13;

     Utilities intended to attract private investments although&#13;
     their finances were too weak to support such investments                  Another contributor was the parallel debate on distribution&#13;
     (and associated tariffs). International developers were                   improvements to achieve continuous water supply. In the&#13;
     exploring the Indian market and multilateral agencies were                years preceding JNNURM, this debate had been quite&#13;
     introducing the PPP concept in the sector. Most water PPPs                vocal. Though JNNURM did not specify continuous&#13;
     attempted in this stage failed since they received inadequate             water supply as a funding condition, the appraisal process&#13;
     support, and pursued PPP models that were inconsistent                    encouraged it. This also created a parallel demand to&#13;
     with the financial capacity of utilities. Projects appeared to            involve the private sector in implementation since public&#13;
     impose high costs on the city, resulting in limited political             agencies were perceived to lack the technical capacity to&#13;

     this background, in the face of any stakeholder opposition, it&#13;
     was easier to avoid the PPP approach and go for 100 percent               With increased adoption of the PPP model, and reduced&#13;
     public funding or simply abandon the project.                             stakeholder apprehensions associated with it, the environment&#13;

         a) Current success is still at the project level; sector-level   In such cases, public funding may actually crowd out PPP.&#13;
            enablers to mainstream PPPs are lacking;                      On the other hand, weak cities will find the cost of PPP high&#13;

                                                                          service outcomes on a sustainable basis. Interventions should&#13;
It should be noted that regulation by itself cannot deliver               focus on creating sector enablers; helping cities follow well-&#13;
effective PPPs; other enablers are also needed for PPPs to                established frameworks; and supporting cities in gaining&#13;
succeed, such as rationalized public funding, institutional               implementation and monitoring capacity. Cities need to keep&#13;
role clarity, and stakeholder support. Therefore, any strategy            in mind that two critical responsibilities of thorough project&#13;
to facilitate PPPs needs to be a holistic one that encompasses            preparation and assuring a balanced commercial structure&#13;
all these elements along with regulation.                                 will continue to rest with them.&#13;

            Trends in private sector participation in
            the Indian water sector : a critical review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in
            the water supply sector began to emerge in the early 1990s
            in most developing countries of the world. Initiated in most
            countries by international private operators, these
            arrangements were typically large-scale PPP projects which
            required the private operators to finance, develop, operate,
            and manage the water supply system for a large population
            base. However, international observers have noted that most
            of these large-scale projects could not be successfully
            implemented on account of a host of interrelated factors.
            These factors included difficulties in achieving financial
            closure by the private operators, sociopolitical barriers,
            tariff-setting issues, and high financial risk. The failure
            of several large-scale projects during this phase resulted
            in many international private operators withdrawing from
            such projects in the developing countries. This gave rise to
            the perception that the number of PPP contracts being
            pursued in the water supply sector was declining.
