     IFC has made sustainability a corporate priority because of fundamental changes taking&#13;
&#13;
     place that are affecting our clients, our countries, and the Corporation. The growing public&#13;
&#13;
     awareness of corporate governance and of environmental and social issues is driving changes&#13;
&#13;
     in consumer behavior, investment, and policy or regulatory adjustments. All signs point to&#13;
&#13;
     continued pressure on the private sector to demonstrate that economic growth and sustain-&#13;
&#13;
     ability are compatible.&#13;
&#13;
       Greater focus on sustainability is a logical evolution of our role. It builds on our experience&#13;
&#13;
     of ensuring the long-term financial and economic viability of our investments and of requiring&#13;
&#13;
     compliance with minimum environmental and social standards. Minimum standards are impor-&#13;
&#13;
     tant and required in IFC projects. They provide safeguards for investors and communities and&#13;
&#13;
     protect project sponsors and IFC from unnecessary financial and reputational risks. At the&#13;
&#13;
     same time, we are helping our clients identify where they can deliver more beneficial corporate&#13;
&#13;
     governance, economic, environmental, and social impact in their own financial interest. A new&#13;
&#13;
     role for IFC is helping clients become aware of opportunities that can be gained from sustain-&#13;
&#13;
     ability, in addition to helping them determine how to meet our minimum standards--in other&#13;
&#13;
     words, delivering more public goods along with private gains.&#13;

&#13;
     NIIT observers, poor, uneducated children were able to accomplish amazing things&#13;
&#13;
     when left to their own devices with a computer and an Internet connection. The project&#13;

     education to rural and low-income children with little access to primary learning.&#13;

                        children can quickly learn how to find their way around the computer and surf&#13;
                        the Web. NIIT teamed up with IFC to find a commercially viable way to bring&#13;
                        Internet-based education to children living in slums and rural areas of India&#13;
                        using specially built Internet kiosks.&#13;

     LAYING FOUNDATIONS&#13;
     BUILDING ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EXPERTISE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In the business world, trust, credibility, and transparency are essential assets. As&#13;
&#13;
     Ukrainian companies seek business partners and outside investment to grow and pro-&#13;
&#13;
     vide employment, they must bring corporate governance practices in line with interna-&#13;
&#13;
     tionally accepted standards. Building on three years of experience in a previous program,&#13;
&#13;
     this year IFC's Private Enterprise Partnership, with support from the governments of&#13;
&#13;
     Canada and Switzerland, started a corporate development project in Ukraine to advise&#13;
&#13;
     companies on sound corporate governance. In addition, the project trains and advises&#13;
&#13;
     Ukrainian medium and large enterprises on financial management, asset restructuring,&#13;
&#13;
     and investor strategies to help them become transparent and competitive business&#13;
&#13;
     partners capable of attracting investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
&amp;#12;Like IFC's similar programs in Armenia and Russia, the project advises the nation-&#13;
al government on improving corporate governance regulations to build investor&#13;
confidence. To ensure that the future managers and lawyers understand the impor-&#13;
tance of good corporate governance and have the right skills, the partnership&#13;
introduces corporate governance courses into local universities.&#13;
  The previous three-year corporate governance program in Ukraine worked with&#13;
67 enterprises, about half of which reported significant benefits after improving&#13;
corporate governance. These businesses achieved success in attracting&#13;
investment, finding partners, and obtaining financing. To reach the broader&#13;
business community, the partnership also developed and distributed to all joint-&#13;
stock companies a corporate governance manual--a how-to guide to running a&#13;
modern corporation; trained representatives of more than 1,500 companies, or&#13;
13 percent of all open joint-stock companies in Ukraine; and drafted more than&#13;
1,400 corporate documents for local companies. At the national level, the&#13;
partnership contributed to six pieces of legislation improving corporate governance&#13;
regulations. In addition, the partnership has trained more than 300 professors and&#13;
has transferred teaching materials, including a case studies manual, to 23 uni-&#13;
versities across Ukraine, which now offer courses on corporate governance to&#13;
3,500 students each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Targeting good corporate governance in Korea&#13;
Weak corporate governance was a major factor contributing to the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. IFC is committed to&#13;
improving corporate practices to enhance the performance of companies in the region.&#13;
  This year IFC approved the Korea Corporate Governance Fund. We aim to support an investment fund that can create value&#13;
for investors by identifying, investing in, and supporting medium-sized Korean companies seeking to implement the highest&#13;
international standards of corporate governance. The fund will translate governance guidelines and initiatives into commercial&#13;
practices and investment behaviors to demonstrate that corporate governance is not simply a matter of regulatory compliance.&#13;
We expect that a greater emphasis on governance by Korean companies will result in lower costs of capital and improved&#13;
allocation of capital within companies, therefore becoming an important source of value and competitive advantage for those&#13;
adopting best practices.&#13;
  The fund will underline the role that investors can play in improving governance standards, particularly among midsize&#13;
corporations. It will also increase the efficiency of capital markets by improving the quality and timeliness of information released&#13;
to the market. The fund will play a role in protecting minority shareholder rights and aligning corporate decision-making with the&#13;
interests of all shareholders.&#13;

     Until recently, graphic designer Yuri Ambros was accustomed to power outages that&#13;
&#13;
     virtually paralyzed his city and made it impossible for him to work at his office. Instead,&#13;
&#13;
     he spent afternoons aimlessly strolling the streets of Chisinau, a city of 700,000 in the&#13;
&#13;
     heart of Moldova, Eastern Europe's poorest country. "I don't remember how long the&#13;

     power was out, because I don't remember bad things," he said, adding, "We pray to&#13;

As bad as it was for him, many were worse off. Outside the capital, some people&#13;
lived without electricity, heat, and water for up to 20 hours a day for eight years.&#13;
The state-owned utilities were overwhelmed by poor collection rates, high&#13;
energy loss, and inadequate financial resources. Moldova's industrial sector was&#13;
devastated, and people grew accustomed to darkness. The lack of power caused&#13;
most of the street lights in Chisinau, the capital, to fail.&#13;
  In response to its power crisis, the government took the difficult but required&#13;
steps to facilitate foreign investment. It created a regulatory framework, estab-&#13;
lished a regulatory body, and crafted a tariff structure based on cost recovery. The&#13;
government privatized three of its five regional electricity distribution companies:&#13;
RED Chisinau, RED Centru, and RED Sud. Unión Fenosa Internacional, the&#13;
international arm of one of Spain's largest private sector utilities, won the com-&#13;
petitive bid for the three companies.&#13;
  Unión Fenosa has improved services, eliminated most power interruptions,&#13;
restricted payment of bills to cash, and significantly increased collections. With&#13;
the implementation of the investment program and the efficiency improvements,&#13;
it is expected that the power sector in Moldova will provide reliable and cost-&#13;
efficient service and be a role model for the power sectors in other countries in&#13;
the region.&#13;
  By rehabilitating existing fixed assets to increase reliability and reduce tech-&#13;

A profitable clean-air solution in Mexico&#13;
&#13;
In Mexico City, IFC worked with a project sponsor who understands that improved air quality and public health&#13;
can be a business opportunity.&#13;
  Ecomex is the only supplier of compressed natural gas for vehicle use in the Mexico City metropolitan area.&#13;
IFC provided $6.5 million in loans and equity financing to Ecomex to help fund a $28 million project to con-&#13;
struct and operate five CNG dispensing stations as well as to finance microbus conversion and operate a&#13;
conversion workshop.&#13;
  CNG-fueled vehicles have much lower emissions of particulate matter than gasoline- or diesel-powered&#13;
vehicles. And since microbuses are heavy air polluters, the environmental benefits of converting these buses&#13;
is especially high.&#13;
  "In a city where the intensive use of vehicles produces at least 98 percent of the toxic carbon monoxide&#13;
and 41 percent of the particulate matter pollution, Ecomex provides a viable commercial alternative that will&#13;
also contribute to improved public health," observed Gavin Murray, director of IFC's Environment and Social&#13;
Development Department.&#13;
  An innovative scheme will help the many microbus owners who could not otherwise bear upfront costs to&#13;
finance bus conversion. Ecomex covers the entire initial costs and recovers those costs over three years&#13;
through the sale of CNG.&#13;

     BUILDING BUSINESSES&#13;
     PROMOTING SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Growth in the domestic private sector creates jobs, increases incomes, and con-&#13;
&#13;
     tributes to poverty reduction. In many low-income economies that have yet to attract&#13;
&#13;
     substantial amounts of foreign investment, the local private sector is made up almost&#13;
&#13;
     entirely of micro, small, and medium enterprises. They are the lifeblood of local&#13;
&#13;
     economies but often struggle against great odds and need well-targeted assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                      In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the IFC-managed Mekong Project Development&#13;
                      Facility works to build enduring, competitive small businesses that are a source&#13;
                      of stable incomes for families. MPDF support makes a tangible difference in these&#13;
                      economies, where difficulties in the local business environment are a major bar-&#13;
                      rier to private sector development. In 2001 MPDF's financial advice helped 40&#13;
                      small and medium businesses raise $28 million in financing, much of it from local&#13;
                      banks. This assistance created approximately 2,600 jobs and generated $26 mil-&#13;
                      lion in foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
                        In the past two years, MPDF has stepped up the pace of its activities, working&#13;
                      to improve the business environment and strengthen the quality of local support&#13;
                      services. The demand for nonfinancial assistance is strong. In Vietnam and&#13;
                      Cambodia, more than 38,000 copies of inexpensive self-study workbooks devel-&#13;
                      oped by MPDF were sold, helping build skills such as marketing, finance and&#13;
                      accounting, production and operations management, and human resources. This&#13;
                      approach complemented the MPDF management training program that 1,600&#13;
                      small and medium business owners or managers took part in during the year.&#13;

     IFC risks its own capital by buying shares in project companies, other project entities, financial institutions,&#13;
     and portfolio or private equity funds. We generally subscribe to between 5 and 20 percent of a project's&#13;
     equity. We will not normally hold more than a 35 percent stake and are never the single largest shareholder&#13;
     in a project. We are a long-term investor in our projects. When it comes time to sell, we prefer to exit by&#13;
     selling shares in the capital markets following a public offering.&#13;
         With quasi-equity instruments we invest through products that have both debt and equity characteris-&#13;
     tics. Some instruments, like subordinated loans and convertible debt, impose fixed-repayment schedules.&#13;
     Others, such as preferred stock and income notes, do not require such rigid repayment arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     LOANS AND INTERMEDIARY SERVICES&#13;
     We finance projects and companies through our A-loans, which are for IFC's own account. IFC does not accept&#13;
     government guarantees. Maturities of A-loans generally range between 7 and 12 years at origination, but some&#13;
     loans have been extended to as long as 20 years. While most IFC loans are provided in major currencies, we are&#13;
     expanding our capacity to offer local currency loans.&#13;
         We carry out comprehensive due diligence before investing in any project. Because of our extensive&#13;
     lending experience in developing countries, we are uniquely qualified to evaluate the risks associated with&#13;
     projects. We are willing to extend loans that are repaid only from the cash flow of the project, with only lim-&#13;
     ited recourse or without recourse to the sponsors.&#13;
         We also make loans to intermediary banks, leasing companies, and other financial institutions through&#13;
     credit lines that result in further on-lending. These credit lines are often targeted to small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     MOBILIZATION&#13;
     Mobilization of private sector financing in developing countries is fundamental to the fulfillment of IFC's&#13;
     role as a development catalyst. We can broaden our impact by mobilizing loans from other financial institu-&#13;
     tions that are willing to lend to projects only with our participation.&#13;
         Syndicated loans, or B-loans, are the cornerstone of IFC's mobilization efforts. Through this mechanism,&#13;
     financial institutions share fully in the commercial credit risk of projects, while IFC remains the lender of&#13;
     record. Participants in IFC's loans share in the advantages that IFC derives as a multilateral development&#13;
     institution, including preferred access to foreign exchange. Where applicable, these participant banks are&#13;
     also exempted from the mandatory provisioning that regulatory requirements impose.&#13;
         In addition, we mobilize private capital for companies by engaging in underwriting, private placements, and&#13;
     equity fund investments that help clients gain access to international capital markets, often for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26&#13;
&amp;#12;GUARANTEES AND RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
Guarantees on financial instruments and stand-by financing provide opportunities for clients to use IFC's good&#13;
credit to access capital markets and gain borrowing flexibility. Products include credit guarantees on loans and&#13;
bonds, trade enhancement and forfaiting facilities, and loan facilities.&#13;
    IFC commonly provides partial credit guarantees on bonds and loans and full credit guarantees on local&#13;
currency loans. Credit guarantees cover all credit risks during a specified portion of the financing term or up&#13;
to a specified capped amount and often serve to extend maturities beyond what private creditors would oth-&#13;
erwise provide. Guarantees in local currency support client needs while helping develop local financial mar-&#13;
kets. In the international bond markets, a foreign currency partial credit guarantee helps an IFC client&#13;
company diversify funding sources by establishing its own credit with international investors.&#13;
    IFC offers partial credit guarantees on trade enhancement and forfaiting facilities. These facilities help&#13;
partner banks expand or extend trade financing programs for local importers and exporters when such pro-&#13;
grams are constrained by country limits or other factors. Loan facilities provide partial credit guarantees for&#13;
general loan programs that serve small and medium enterprises.&#13;
    Our risk management services enable clients to access derivatives markets. Currency-hedging instru-&#13;
ments allow clients to hedge exposure related to foreign currency borrowings. Interest rate hedges allow&#13;
clients to transform the nature of their borrowings (for example, fixed rate to floating rate). Commodity&#13;
price-hedging products allow clients to reduce risks related to price volatility. We also provide risk manage-&#13;
ment facilities so that clients can use hedging products for a fixed period of time on a pre-approved basis.&#13;

OTHER SERVICES&#13;
ADVISORY SERVICES&#13;
IFC advisory services are designed to improve the investment climate in member countries and the business&#13;
practices of companies in which we invest. They play an increasingly important role in the way IFC approaches&#13;
its investment activities.&#13;
     We undertake a wide array of financial market advisory assignments, specializing in securities markets&#13;
and in banking and credit institutions. Assignments address areas such as local debt market development&#13;
and capacity building at financial institutions.&#13;
     The work of the Private Sector Advisory Services, jointly managed by IFC and the World Bank, covers&#13;
policy issues, sector advice, and specific transactions. Our activity in this area includes advice on competi-&#13;
tion policy, privatization structuring, and policy analysis of foreign investment issues.&#13;
     Another jointly managed unit, the Small and Medium Enterprise Department, focuses on business envi-&#13;
ronment issues, capacity building, and the development of innovative financing techniques. The IFC corpo-&#13;
rate governance program advises on practices and policies at IFC investee companies, assists in addressing&#13;
country-specific risks, and provides information on promoting strong corporate governance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
Technical assistance further complements IFC's investment activities by offering advisory and training services&#13;
to governments and private companies. IFC manages special project development facilities that help small and&#13;
medium enterprises. IFC also manages the Technical Assistance Trust Funds program, which is supported by&#13;
donor governments. These funds sponsor feasibility and sector studies, training initiatives, environmental and&#13;
social review of projects, and advisory assignments to governments. In the former Soviet Union, IFC's Private&#13;
Enterprise Partnership provides technical assistance and advice to companies and governments to attract&#13;
investment, stimulate small and medium enterprises, and improve the business environment.&#13;

     OPERATIONS&#13;
&#13;
     During the past year, investment flows to developing countries shrank as companies in&#13;
&#13;
     the developed world faced their own challenges. The global economic slowdown also hurt&#13;
&#13;
     businesses that rely on exports to the world's major economies. Our private sector clients&#13;
&#13;
     experienced an urgent need for funding that could not be satisfied by commercial sources.&#13;
&#13;
     This was also evident in some of our middle-income client countries, where even large,&#13;
&#13;
     well-established companies faced financing difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Gross commitments of long-term capital to developing countries fell from $228 bil-&#13;
                                   lion in calendar year 2000 to $171 billion in 2001. Net flows of bank loans to devel-&#13;
                                   oping countries were negative in 2001.&#13;
                                     Responding to the diminishing sources of financing in emerging markets from the&#13;
                                   banking sector, we supported financial institutions and companies to help maintain&#13;
                                   the momentum of economic activity. For example, in Brazil we provided Banco Itaú&#13;
                                   and Unibanco with separate credit lines totaling $250 million. The funding will be&#13;
                                   used to finance projects in infrastructure, energy, industrial expansion, and envi-&#13;
                                   ronmental upgrading. A major aspect of our financing to larger companies this year&#13;
                                   was our support for social and corporate governance practices. We helped Colombian&#13;

                      dollar-denominated floating-rate debt within an interest rate band. In India, IFC&#13;
                      signed a risk management facility with the State Bank of India that offers the&#13;
                      client greater flexibility to hedge its foreign exchange exposures and for IFC to&#13;
                      hedge its own rupee-dollar exposure.&#13;
                        Risk management products are offered to IFC customers for hedging purposes and&#13;
                      not for speculation. IFC hedges its own market risk on these transactions and con-&#13;
                      tinuously monitors exposure on them.&#13;

                      The World Bank Group Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Department, a joint ini-&#13;
                      tiative of IFC and the World Bank, collaborates closely with a wide range of external&#13;
                      partners in improving the business environment, providing access to capital and sup-&#13;
                      port services, building capacity, and forging closer links with large-scale projects.&#13;
                        The department coordinates the activities of IFC-managed SME facilities (see&#13;
                      sidebar). It also works with other donors to launch new ones, such as the China Project&#13;
                      Development Facility in Sichuan Province that began operations this year. In Sichuan,&#13;

                      medium businesses are characterized by a high degree of informality, opaque finan-&#13;

                      ernance. Local businesses are hampered by lack of access to bank credit, high&#13;
                      registration costs, and interest rate controls that limit lending to smaller businesses.&#13;
                         The SME Capacity Building Facility provides support for small business growth&#13;
                      through its $7.1 million in funding for innovative pilot programs and partnerships.&#13;
                      CBF support has been instrumental in establishing IFC's partnerships, which are&#13;
                      expected to become a key ally in IFC's future SME efforts (see p.59).&#13;
                        In the former Soviet Union the Private Enterprise Partnership supports small and&#13;
                      medium businesses by developing financial leasing (see p.22). The partnership&#13;

     Sub-Saharan Africa felt the full impact of the global economic shakeout during the past year.&#13;
     In South Africa several factors, including lower investment flows, led to a precipitous decline&#13;
     in the currency in late 2001. Lack of integration into global capital markets spared most other&#13;
     countries from the shock of slowed external capital flows, but declining commodity prices&#13;
     still took a heavy toll on economic performance.&#13;

      Broadcasting development impact&#13;
      When television was introduced in Africa, the medium was controlled primarily by&#13;
      state-owned stations, which offered only limited programming. With liberalization,&#13;
      there now exists the potential for increasing the depth and appeal of television to the&#13;
      previously underserved African market.&#13;
        TV Africa provides free, high-quality programming to a network of 39 local&#13;
      affiliates in 23 African countries in exchange for advertising time with each affiliate.&#13;
      The company's offerings include locally produced shows as well as international&#13;
      programming designed to appeal to broad African audiences. This arrangement&#13;
      brings an improved quality and breadth of programming to viewers compared to what&#13;
      individual stations could provide, while allowing advertisers to reach an African&#13;
      market of up to 110 million viewers. Our equity investment will provide the network&#13;
      with the funding necessary to achieve profitability by adding affiliates, upgrading&#13;
      studio and transmission equipment, and expanding the viewing audience.&#13;
        TV Africa is committed to providing family-oriented content not generally available&#13;
      to individual affiliates, regional and international sporting events, and locally pro-&#13;
      duced African programming. IFC and TV Africa are also working together to enhance&#13;
      developmental benefits by ensuring the provision of educational programming,&#13;
      information on HIV/AIDS, and other important health and public service notices.&#13;
      The network will limit the broadcast of tobacco and alcohol advertising, respecting&#13;
      local regulations and community norms, and will insist on warning statements to&#13;
      accompany any such advertisements.&#13;
        As the company becomes profitable, it will fund more African-content production,&#13;
      allowing it ultimately to reach a local-content target of 40 percent of total program-&#13;
      ming hours. TV Africa has been a leader in bringing quality programming to African&#13;
      audiences and supporting the growth of both independent African television stations&#13;
      and the production of local content.&#13;

      The first foreign-owned hospital in Ho Chi Minh City&#13;
      As Vietnam makes progress in establishing a modern, market economy, it faces new&#13;
      health challenges, such as an increase in noncommunicable diseases like heart prob-&#13;
      lems and cancer. There is a shortage of high-quality facilities to address such changing&#13;
      patterns of disease in Vietnam. The Franco-Vietnamese Hospital will help meet the acute&#13;
      shortage of quality hospitals by providing highly advanced diagnostic and surgical opera-&#13;
      tions and modern equipment.&#13;
          The 200-bed hospital, located in the South Saigon Development Area of Ho Chi Minh&#13;
      City, will offer modern facilities, international-quality services, a transparent pricing policy,&#13;
      and professional management. It will focus on day surgery operations that will save time&#13;
      and cost for the patients. Highly experienced French surgeons and doctors will work side&#13;
      by side with Vietnamese medical doctors and nurses, as well as other foreign staff, trans-&#13;
      ferring advanced medical know-how to local medical professionals. The French doctors,&#13;
      many of whom are prominent within their profession, will work in the hospital two weeks&#13;
      per year on a rotating assignment basis. The Franco-Vietnamese Hospital will also collab-&#13;
      orate with public hospitals and universities in Vietnam for public service programs. It will&#13;
      be the first hospital of this kind in Vietnam.&#13;
          IFC committed $8 million this year to support the $40 million project. We worked with&#13;
      the sponsors of the project, a group of French medical doctors, for two years in advance&#13;
      of construction. We have been instrumental in developing the project's concept and in&#13;
      ensuring that services are affordable to a large segment of the population from the&#13;
      outset. The scale of the project will be modest but will include social outreach efforts and&#13;
      programs for low-income families. We encouraged the Asian Development Bank,&#13;
      Proparco (the private arm of the Agence Française de Développement), and the Bank for&#13;
      Investment and Development of Vietnam (a Vietnamese bank) to participate along with us&#13;
      in financing the project.&#13;
          Construction is underway, and the hospital is scheduled to open in January 2003.&#13;
      IFC will continue monitoring the project to ensure successful implementation of&#13;
      environmental and social commitments and the development of sound corporate&#13;
      governance practices.&#13;

     Private sector prospects remain strong throughout Europe and Central Asia, as the momen-&#13;
     tum for market reforms is robust and economies are expanding. The slowdown in the world&#13;
     economy during 2001 had an uneven impact in the region. The weaker outlook for exports,&#13;
     declining foreign direct investment, and higher energy prices weighed heavily on some&#13;
     economies, although most continued to grow.&#13;

 Landmark banking sector privatization&#13;
 IFC structured financing to settle the crippling liabilities of several state-owned banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our work paved the&#13;
 way for the sale of these banks to strategic foreign investors.&#13;
   Privredna Banka Sarajevo and its spin-offs, or the PBS banks, faced a major stumbling block to privatization. These banks had&#13;
 inherited burdensome liabilities from prewar guarantees. This made it impossible to attract strategic investors before these obliga-&#13;
 tions were settled, while the bank faced the threat of liquidation by December 31, 2001.&#13;
   To solve this dilemma, IFC developed a plan to create a special-purpose vehicle that allowed the banks in the group to stave off&#13;
 liquidation and move toward privatization. With funding from IFC and the manager of the special-purpose vehicle, B.P. Invest Consult&#13;
 (Austria), all creditors' claims have been settled at a discount. In return, the vehicle acquired majority stakes in selected PBS banks,&#13;
 which were then considered privatized. Technical assistance for this project was supported by Sweden. This privatization will make&#13;
 possible a significant improvement in the financial sector and promote progress in financial intermediation to private sector compa-&#13;
 nies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;

Support for private sector rebuilding&#13;
IFC is supporting the private sector in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to help the country rebuild. This year we invested in Tigar,&#13;
a leading tire and rubber goods producer and a key employer in F.R. Yugoslavia. The euro 20 million investment is the largest pri-&#13;
vate investment in a single Yugoslav company in more than 10 years.&#13;
   After a decade of war and international isolation, Tigar's production capacity and product competitiveness have been sub-&#13;
stantially challenged. Nevertheless, the company succeeded in continuing its operations, maintaining its position as the second-&#13;
largest exporter in Yugoslavia, with Western Europe accounting for more than two-thirds of its market.&#13;
   Our investment will support Tigar's comprehensive two-year expansion and restructuring plan, which includes a corporate&#13;
modernization program and consolidation of its existing strategic alliance with Michelin, a leading multinational tire company.&#13;
In addition, IFC is providing Tigar with extensive technical assistance supported by the Swedish development agency SIDA and by&#13;
SEED, the IFC-managed enterprise facility in the Balkans. The program is intended to create a sustainable strategy for Tigar's&#13;
noncore businesses and generate new employment opportunities in small enterprises in the Pirot area.&#13;

     The Latin America and Caribbean region is facing a difficult economic period. Beginning in&#13;
     mid-2001, growth slowed and poverty reduction stalled across the region. Confidence in the&#13;
     economy of Argentina was waning at the start of our fiscal year and then collapsed as the&#13;
     political situation and macroeconomic imbalances sent the country into one of the most&#13;
     severe crises in its history.&#13;

      IFC's investment this year helped Mexican wood products company Holding Montealbán&#13;
      upgrade its production facilities, increase its capacity, and strengthen its distribution net-&#13;
      work. The company proactively employs environmentally responsible practices and has&#13;
      improved its business prospects as a result.&#13;
          Holding Montealbán has been working with the Forest Stewardship Council for five&#13;
      years to obtain a chain-of-custody certification for certain product lines to verify that its&#13;
      wood is derived from sustainable sources. The company has already achieved 80 per-&#13;
      cent certification for its door lines and full certification for the targeted products of its&#13;
      sawmill subsidiary--the first for a Mexican firm.&#13;
          International certification will allow the company to access the European Union&#13;
      market while supplying the North American market, which is increasingly adopting the&#13;
      same purchasing practices. IFC encouraged Holding Montealbán to enhance and for-&#13;
      malize its existing technical assistance to help local communities improve forestry man-&#13;
      agement and ensure the long-term sustainability of their practices. The program will&#13;
      facilitate community access to forestry programs, such as the World Bank's Community&#13;

     continue to be among the lowest in the world. Combined with the heavy involvement of many&#13;
     governments in the business of business, the climate for private sector investment&#13;
     remains challenging.&#13;

&amp;#12;        ALGERIA&#13;
      Extending access to the financial sector&#13;
      In Algeria, small and medium companies frequently have little contact with the formal&#13;
      financial sector. To address this problem, Algérie Leasing Corporation was established in&#13;
      2002 as the first private sector company of its kind in the country. AL provides medium-&#13;
      term financial leases in the construction, transport, manufacturing, and agribusiness&#13;
      sectors, among others. The project also supports the diversification of an economy&#13;
      heavily dependent on the export of oil and gas.&#13;
         Building on IFC's global experience in leasing and financial markets, the project will&#13;
      provide Algerian small businesses with increased access to finance, in many cases for&#13;
      the first time. Algerian banks, which generally lack leasing services capacity, are unable&#13;
      to reach that market. State-owned banks dominate the financial sector and are geared&#13;
      largely toward serving publicly owned companies, while private financial institutions&#13;
      need to offer new services to nascent private sector clients.&#13;
         This project is expected to promote growth and increase competition in the financial&#13;
      sector, which should encourage new players to enter the market and support the devel-&#13;
      opment of new financial instruments for Algeria. IFC and the World Bank have played a&#13;
      role in developing leasing laws and regulations in the country since the mid-1990s.&#13;
      Support for AL demonstrates how an IFC investment can assist other World Bank Group&#13;
      institutions in developing private sector policy.&#13;

   EGYPT&#13;
 Supplying auto parts and technical know-how&#13;
 As the auto industry has moved away from fully integrated production facilities, leading manufacturers have been looking for&#13;
 high-quality, long-term partners to supply parts and engineering know-how. In their search for lower-cost suppliers, European&#13;
 automotive companies in particular are turning to North African firms as the source of these components. Egypt, because of the ready&#13;
 availability of lower-cost labor and energy as well as its proximity to Europe, is a prime location.&#13;
   IFC's euro 3.5 million investment in Alexandria Automotive Casting (AAC) demonstrates the potential of Egypt as a supplier.&#13;
 Continental Teves (CT) of Germany, one of the top manufacturers of automotive brake systems, approached the main project sponsor,&#13;
 the Mansour Group, regarding the supply of high-quality castings using state-of-the-art technology. IFC was able to provide long-term&#13;
 foreign currency financing, which was not available from the local banking sector; the total project cost will be $14 million. IFC was&#13;
 also valued for its ability to ensure best environmental and social practices in the development of this project. IFC's participation is&#13;
 expected to provide a demonstration effect for other foreign investors to support export-oriented manufacturing in Egypt.&#13;
   AAC will be located near the Alexandria port and will employ 35 workers. In its first five years of operation, AAC will have guaran-&#13;
 teed exports of a certain volume to CT. After it has achieved full capacity and attained a proven product quality, it can seek other cus-&#13;
 tomers in the automotive industry.&#13;

SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW&#13;
&#13;
As public concern about environmental, social, and corporate governance issues grows, there has been more&#13;
interest in the impact of businesses and financial institutions. Sustainability reporting is an increasingly&#13;
common response by the private sector to this interest, whether undertaken on a mandated or a voluntary&#13;
basis. Such reporting offers clients, shareholders, and other stakeholders a better and more comprehensive&#13;
understanding of performance. Building on a number of reporting and accountability initiatives established by IFC&#13;
in recent years, we continue to seek to produce better information than ever on the Corporation, as evidenced&#13;
in this, IFC's first Sustainability Review.1&#13;
     The review reflects the evolution of IFC's approach to its key strategic priority of sustainable development. From&#13;
its outset in 1956, IFC has aimed to promote economic activity that is sustainable over time, through long-term, finan-&#13;
cially viable private sector investment that demonstrates a positive economic impact. Since 1989, IFC has also&#13;
required that projects comply with minimum environmental and social standards. Today, IFC is responding to a&#13;
continuously changing business landscape by helping clients find opportunities to enhance the economic, environ-&#13;
mental, social, and corporate governance impact of their projects, while reaping financial benefits from such actions.&#13;
     The business case lies at the heart of IFC's new approach to sustainability. We have found that in a growing&#13;
number of our projects, the pursuit of self-interest is an effective complement to regulatory approaches for&#13;
making progress on global sustainability. This has made sustainability an important vehicle for IFC to add value&#13;
to our private sector clients and complement member countries' own development efforts. With its commitment,&#13;
experience, and resources, IFC is increasingly becoming the sustainability partner of choice.&#13;

&amp;#12;     IFC'S MISSION is to promote sustainable private sector&#13;
     investment in developing countries, helping to reduce poverty&#13;
     and improve people's lives.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is a global investor and advisor committed to promoting sus-&#13;
     tainable projects in developing member countries that are economically beneficial, financially and com-&#13;
     mercially sound, and environmentally and socially sustainable. We believe that sound economic growth&#13;
     is critical to poverty reduction; that it is grounded in the development of entrepreneurship and success-&#13;
     ful private investment; and that a conducive business environment is needed for private enterprises to&#13;
     thrive and contribute to improving people's lives. We seek to improve our performance by responding to&#13;
     clients promptly, sharing our successes, and learning from our experience. We are therefore committed&#13;
     to and strive to uphold the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
     Added Value&#13;
     We add value to our developing member countries by:&#13;
     · taking educated risks that the private sector will not take alone&#13;
     · pioneering opportunities in frontier countries and sectors to maximize our projects'&#13;
       demonstration effect and catalytic role&#13;
     · developing innovative new products and services that better meet our clients' needs&#13;
     · providing quality advice when the private sector is unwilling or unable to do so&#13;
     · sharing knowledge to promote successful private investment, entrepreneurship, and&#13;
       enabling business environments&#13;
     · integrating best environmental, social, and corporate governance practices in all our work&#13;
     · being responsive to the needs of our private sector clients in a timely manner&#13;
&#13;
     Integrity&#13;
     We act with integrity in our transactions and daily work by:&#13;
     · holding ourselves and our clients to the highest professional and ethical standards&#13;
     · recognizing, in every investment, the importance and value of good corporate governance&#13;
     · seeking to be transparent, accountable, and equitable&#13;
     · being honest, open, and fair in our dealings with each other, with our clients, and with local communities&#13;
&#13;
     Environmental and Social Sustainability&#13;
     We demonstrate our core commitment to sustainable development by:&#13;
     · ensuring that our projects attain high environmental and social standards&#13;
     · consulting with local communities on project-specific environmental and social impacts and opportunities&#13;
     · working with responsible clients, other lenders, and local NGOs&#13;
     · listening actively and responding to stakeholders and their concerns&#13;

&amp;#12;OPERATIONS EVALUATION GROUP&#13;
Every year in its annual review, OEG evaluates IFC investment&#13;
operations, analyzing the performance of randomly selected proj-&#13;
ects and describing the patterns that emerge from that analysis.&#13;
The review draws lessons from past performance and makes&#13;
recommendations to management and the Board for improving&#13;
IFC's results in pursuit of its strategy.&#13;
  In its most recent annual review of 171 projects approved dur-&#13;

achieved both good development impacts and good investment&#13;

                                                                                       The B-loan is funded by participants on terms that may differ from those&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2002 : investing in a sustainable private sector
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report concerns the operations of
            the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2002. The year began with economic uncertainty in many
            parts of the world. The scale and magnitude of the events of
            September 11 affected business. By mid-year the global
            economic uncertainty, and especially exposure to Argentina,
            left IFC vulnerable to its first-ever annual loss. Despite
            substantial new provisioning, the IFC was able to show a
            $161 million operating profit for the year, committing $3.1
            billion in financing to 204 projects for IFC's own
            account, a 14 percent increase over the previous year. About
            two-thirds of the IFC's new investments were in
            financial markets, infrastructure, information technology,
            and health and education. Lending to small and medium
            enterprises directly and through intermediaries amounted to
            about $540 million, or 17 percent of new financing for
            IFC's account. First volume of the report contents: IFC
