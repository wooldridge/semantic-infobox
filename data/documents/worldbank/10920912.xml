&#13;
The Global Knowledge '97 conference was held in Toronto from June 22-25, 1997, to address&#13;
issues surrounding the role of the 'information revolution' in the development process. The&#13;
conference had several objectives, including: the sharing of understanding about the role of&#13;
knowledge and information in development, and the changes wrought by new technologies;&#13;
sharing strategies, experiences and tools in harnessing knowledge for development; and&#13;
building partnerships and international dialogue on these issues, including a strengthening of&#13;
the knowledge and information resources of developing countries. A large number of&#13;
conference activities were organized to pursue these objectives, including plenary meetings,&#13;
working sessions (such as seminars, working groups, etc), an exhibition space, a&#13;
'cybercafe' (on-site computer network), open space events, a video festival and&#13;
videoconferencing/internet discussions. The conference was attended by over 1,750 persons&#13;
from over 100 countries. The evaluation of the conference was conducted by a consultant to&#13;
the EDI Evaluation Unit, Dr. Janet Billson, from Group Dimensions Research, and it drew on&#13;
a number of data sources. These were: questionnaires completed by participants at the start&#13;
and end of the conference; participant 'suggestions' forms; formal interviews and focus group&#13;
meetings with samples of participants; informal interviews of a number of participants;&#13;
participant observation; and questionnaires completed by exhibitors and session organizers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  GK '97 successfully brought together a very diverse range of participant. Conference&#13;
        participants and sponsors reported significant gains in learning, new information and&#13;
        building partnerships. Participants also gave the conference above-average ratings for&#13;
        its overall effectiveness (with a mean rating of 4.1 (on a 6-point scale from 1=&#13;
        minimum to 6 = maximum), and judged it highly relevant to their work responsibilities&#13;
        (with a modal rating of 6 on the 6-point scale). The effectiveness of the conference&#13;
        would have been enhanced, however, if its structure had included more breathing room&#13;
        for dialogue, and if it had facilitated informal partnership-building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  A number of other aspects of the conference were also judged successful. These&#13;
        included the opportunity to hear the views of international leaders, and many&#13;
        participants were both stimulated and impressed by this. Participants were generally&#13;
        enthusiastic about learning practical ideas which they could use in their own country.&#13;
        The enthusiastic support and involvement of a broad range of sponsors was another&#13;
        notable feature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Two objectives achieved in designing the conference were a high level of stakeholder&#13;
        involvement and broad sponsorship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The internet discussion (ie, the 'virtual conference') preceding, during and after the&#13;
        conference provided a highly positive experience for many participants and for those&#13;
        who could not attend the conference itself. It allowed meaningful discussions of case&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 studies, practical aspects of implementing information and communication&#13;
 technology, as well as substantive discussion of how and when this technology can&#13;
 enhance development and benefit the world's poor. Many participants regarded this as&#13;
 very useful for learning, sharing ideas, and networking. Perhaps one reason why this&#13;
 feature of the conference was viewed as so useful was the limitations of the physical&#13;
 conference (discussed below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe conference was also successful in producing other significant outcomes. These&#13;
 were: the success in putting the issue of the role of information and communication&#13;
 technology on the international development agenda; the fostering of working&#13;
 relationships between public and private sector participants; and laying the&#13;
 groundwork for concrete plans for further action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were also a number of less successful features of the conference. A key one&#13;
 was the emergence of a 'talking heads' model for both plenary and working sessions --&#13;
 communication tended to be one-way, and sessions were overloaded and over-&#13;
 structured; this was a greater problem for the plenaries than the working sessions.&#13;
 The result was that little time was left for synergistic exchanges and this constricted&#13;
 dialogue, participation, and the building of relationships -- these were important&#13;
 deficiencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lA useful suggestion for improving future conferences was that there should be either&#13;
 smaller numbers of participants or a less structured and congested timetable, to&#13;
 encourage and allow networking and partnership-building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lMany presenters, especially in the plenaries, spoke too long, or seemed to miss the&#13;
 point of the conference themes, and some were simply 'bad' speakers. Many&#13;
 participants questioned the seemingly blind assumption expressed by some speakers&#13;
 that information communication and technology is unambiguously good for developing&#13;
 countries and that it will not increase the gap between the haves and have-nots. The&#13;
 conference did not provide early opportunities to acknowledge, debate and perhaps&#13;
 reconcile these differing perspectives; it did not devote significant attention to&#13;
 understanding the role of knowledge and information in development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lWhile there was some limited success in integrating information communication and&#13;
 technology into the conference's own structure and processes, participants judged&#13;
 that technology was underutilized. Participants characterized this as 'an ironic&#13;
 situation' and 'a missed opportunity'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe difficulties which were experienced were exacerbated by some organizational&#13;
 problems with the conference itself. The physical layout of the conference in three&#13;
 separate hotels discouraged interaction, as did the lack of gathering places where&#13;
 people could meet and discuss issues. Problems were also experienced with travel&#13;
 and lodging arrangements, with the under-representation of women, and with a&#13;
 perceived over-emphasis on Africa at the expense of other regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThese difficulties do not detract from the many successful features of the conference.&#13;
 Global Knowledge '97 was a successful conference that provided participants with&#13;
 new knowledge, practical information, and access to technologies many had never&#13;
 experienced. The vast majority of participants looked forward to similar meetings --&#13;
 both actual and virtual -- in the future.&#13;
