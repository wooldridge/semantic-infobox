THE ICSID CASELOAD â&#128;&#147;&#13;
     STATISTICS&#13;
    (ISSUE 2013-2)&#13;
&amp;#12;            The ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics&#13;
                                                (Issue 2013-2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This issue of the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics updates the profile of the ICSID caseload, historically&#13;
and for the Centreâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal year 2013. It is based on cases registered or administered by ICSID as&#13;
of June 30, 2013.&#13;
&#13;
As in the previous issues, this document illustrates: the number of cases registered under the&#13;
ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules; the number of other cases administered by the&#13;
ICSID Secretariat; the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in registered arbitration and&#13;
conciliation cases; the geographic distribution of ICSID cases by the State party to the dispute,&#13;
and the economic sectors involved in ICSID disputes. It also contains data on outcomes in ICSID&#13;
arbitration and conciliation proceedings, including further information on disputes decided by&#13;
arbitral tribunals, data on discontinued ICSID arbitration proceedings, and outcomes to date in&#13;
annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention. The nationalities and geographic origins of&#13;
arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc committee members appointed in ICSID cases are also&#13;
featured.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat will continue to publish the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics on a bi-annual basis, and&#13;
welcomes any comments or suggestions by email at ICSIDsecretariat@worldbank.org.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      The ICSID Secretariat offers various levels of administrative and organizational support for non-ICSID&#13;
      dispute settlement in State-State or investor-State proceedings. Among the State-State cases administered&#13;
      in the past decade are the Southern Bluefin Tuna case (Australia and New Zealand v. Japan), an expert&#13;
      determination proceeding under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, and an arbitration under the Softwood&#13;
      Lumber Agreement of 2006 (United States v. Canada).&#13;
&#13;
      The Centre also frequently provides administrative assistance to investor-State arbitrations under the&#13;
      UNCITRAL Rules or other ad hoc dispute settlement provisions. The Centreâ&#128;&#153;s services in these proceedings&#13;
      range from support with the organization of hearings to administrative services comparable to those&#13;
      provided in ICSID cases. The Secretariat also acts as appointing authority, and decides proposals for&#13;
      disqualification of arbitrators, upon request. In addition to administering UNCITRAL arbitrations, ICSID has&#13;
      also assisted with the organization of hearings in arbitration proceedings conducted under the auspices of&#13;
      the ICC, LCIA, PCA, and other institutions.&#13;

            The ICSID caseload : statistics
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This issue of the International Center
            for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
            Caseload-statistics updates the profile of the ICSID
            caseload, historically and for the calendar year 2013. It is
            based on cases registered or administered by ICSID as of
            June 30, 2013. As in the previous issues, this document
            illustrates: the number of cases registered under the ICSID
            convention and additional facility rules; the number of
            other cases administered by the ICSID secretariat; the basis
            of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in registered
            arbitration and conciliation cases; the geographic
            distribution of ICSID cases by the state party to the
            dispute, and the economic sectors involved in ICSID
            disputes. It also contains data on outcomes in ICSID
            arbitration and conciliation proceedings, including further
            information on disputes decided by arbitral tribunals, data
            on discontinued ICSID arbitration proceedings, and outcomes
            to date in annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention.
            The nationalities and geographic origins of arbitrators,
            conciliators and ad hoc committee members appointed in ICSID
            cases are also featured.
