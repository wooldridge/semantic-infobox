An Aka girl washing her hands after coming back&#13;
with her family from working in the fields near&#13;
Chiang Rai in northern Thailand. It is an Aka&#13;
tradition that girls work in the fields. In the old days,&#13;
opium was the main cash crop; more recently, with&#13;
assistance provided by both the Thai royal family&#13;
and the Bank, farmers have switched to corn, vege-&#13;
tables, and flowers.&#13;

Fiscal 1991 saw the IBRD achieve financial&#13;
targets and undertake programs designed to&#13;
improve its ability to facilitate the funding of&#13;

* Reaching its goal in March 1991 of having  I&#13;
the currency composition of its loan pool in       __2&#13;
targeted proportions, thereby improving bor-    1&#13;
rowers' ability to manage their attendant ex-  !&#13;
change risks.&#13;
* Strengthening its reserves-to-loan ratio by&#13;
reaching 11.2 percent, the upper range of the  l 1l&#13;
current target (see Figure 4-1).' The increase&#13;
largely resulted from the allocation in fiscal&#13;
1990 (effective in fiscal 1991) of $750 million of  l&#13;
that year's net income to the general reserve,  I 10&#13;
bringing reserves at the end of fiscal 1991 to&#13;
$10.0 billion.&#13;
* Diversifying and globalizing the trading&#13;
and risk-management techniques utilized in   I&#13;
investing the IBRD's liquid-assets portfolio.  ; 1&#13;
* Borrowing the equivalent of $10.9 billion&#13;
of medium-term and long-term funding on at-&#13;
tractive terms in the world's financial markets&#13;
(see Table 4-1).                                 8&#13;

an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements&#13;

all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Development&#13;

June 30, 1991 and 1990, and the changes in their accumulated surplus and grants and their cash flows for the&#13;
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with&#13;
International Accounting Standards. These financial statements are the responsibility of management; our&#13;
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our&#13;
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International&#13;
Auditing Guidelines, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about&#13;
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test&#13;
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting&#13;
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;
