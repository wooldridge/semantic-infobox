This report is one in a series of products of the Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Handwashing&#13;
Project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The aim of the project is to test whether&#13;
innovative promotional approaches can generate widespread and sustained increases in handwashing with&#13;
soap at critical times among the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
This series of reports documents the findings of work in progress about handwashing with soap in order&#13;
to encourage the exchange of ideas and information and to promote learning. Please send your feedback&#13;

The authors would like to thank all handwashing players in Vietnam for their time and willingness to&#13;
participate in this assessment; and thank the World Bank/WSP for funding such an endeavor so important&#13;
to the success and sustainability of handwashing with soap in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
We would particularly like to thank the staff of the Ministry of Health at the national, provincial, district,&#13;
and local levels for their assistance, support, and patience. The magnitude of the information gathered&#13;
would not have been possible without this support.&#13;
&#13;
We hope that this report will facilitate the next steps to be taken, assist in strengthening an eventual&#13;
Vietnam Handwashing with Soap Initiative, and ultimately aid in having the desired impact on&#13;
handwashing practices with soap, thus reducing diarrheal disease in Vietnam.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                          SUMMARY&#13;
To follow up country work supported by the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing&#13;
(PPPHW), the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) received funding from the Bill&#13;
&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to support projects to scale up the promotion of handwashing with&#13;
soap (HWWS) in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The major project objectives of the&#13;
Handwashing Initiative are:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   inculcate the HWWS habit among millions of mothers and children in these countries,&#13;
   â&#128;¢   use a strong monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) component to enhance the&#13;
       conceptualizing and management of such programs,&#13;
   â&#128;¢   establish sustainable programs that will continue and expand after this four-year grant&#13;
       ends.&#13;
Enabling environment assessments are being carried out in all four countries to assess current&#13;
conditions for scalability and sustainability and to make recommendations for improving&#13;
conditions that are not supportive. This report summarizes the study in Vietnam. All four county&#13;
studies are following a similar methodology, developed by WSP, to examine nine dimensions of&#13;
scalability/sustainability through individual and group in-depth interviews and an electronic&#13;
survey in which respondents are asked to score various statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;The project is designed to achieve key targets in Vietnam of changing the handwashing with&#13;
soap (HWWS) behavior of 2.3 million poor women of fertile age (15â&#128;&#147;49) and poor children ages&#13;
5â&#128;&#147;9 by the end of two years of project implementation.&#13;
There are presently two handwashing initiatives ongoing in Vietnam:&#13;
   1. The National Handwashing Initiative supported by WSP with funding from the Danish&#13;
      Embassy (US$1 million) and the Gates Foundation ($1.6 million) has been active since&#13;
      January 2006. This Initiative is in the pilot stage. Under Ministry of Health (MOH)&#13;
      leadership, with participation from the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union, soap manufacturers, and other&#13;
      handwashing players, this Initiative plans to utilize national- and community-level&#13;
      behavior change communication techniques to influence the behavior of mothers of&#13;
      children under five and primary school children in an estimated 250 communes of&#13;
      roughly 25 districts within eight provinces of Vietnam. The Initiative has conducted&#13;
      formative, behavioral research; has hosted several discussion workshops; and is in the&#13;
      process of selecting a communications agency to develop and implement its&#13;
      communication campaign.&#13;
   2. The Unilever-supported â&#128;&#156;Share Love Not Germsâ&#128;? campaign has been ongoing since 2006&#13;
      in conjunction with the MOH Department of Preventive Medicine (DPM). This Initiative&#13;
      is in the implementation phase. Total funding for the Unilever-supported campaign is&#13;
      US$2.6 million for five years (2006â&#128;&#147;10) starting in 10 pilot provinces. This campaign is&#13;
      also designed to change the HWWS rates in project areas. Since May 2006, mass media&#13;
      presentations have been aired and disseminated, and road shows and other community&#13;
      communication activities have been conducted. A social marketing approach has been&#13;
      employed, as well as creative behavior change techniques.&#13;
This enabling environment baseline assessment examined a conceptual framework encompassing&#13;
nine dimensions of sustainability and scalability: (1) Policy, Strategy, and Direction; (2)&#13;
Partnerships; (3) Institutional Arrangements; (4) Program Methodology; (5) Implementation&#13;
Capacity; (6) Availability of Products and Tools; (7) Financing; (8) Cost-Effective&#13;
Implementation; and (9) Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
The political will is evident and can provide the springboard for moving HWWS forward. The&#13;
potential to create a stable enabling environment for HWWS in Vietnam is high. However,&#13;
although willingness exists, much of the foundation still needs to be laid. Table 1 provides an&#13;
overview of opportunities and potential limitations for the Vietnam Handwashing Initiative as&#13;
well as overarching recommendations for laying this foundation.&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Background&#13;
Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the WSP Scaling Up Handwashing Project will&#13;
follow the basic approach of the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW), a global&#13;
initiative established in 2001 to promote handwashing with soap at scale to reduce diarrheal and&#13;
respiratory infections. 1 This approach draws extensively on lessons learned from two large-scale&#13;
handwashing promotion programs. Programma Saniya, implemented in Bobo-Dioulasso,&#13;
Burkina Faso, showed the importance of undertaking careful consumer research at the outset of a&#13;
handwashing promotion program. The Central American Handwashing for Diarrheal Disease&#13;
Prevention Program showed that an effective approach to changing hygiene behaviors at large&#13;
scale was to work with a broad partnership of public and private sector stakeholders that have a&#13;
mutual interest in increasing handwashing with soap, to focus on the one behavior with largest&#13;
potential health impact (handwashing with soap), and to promote it with cost-effective,&#13;
consumer-centered marketing.&#13;
The Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
In hopes of facilitating effective replication and scaling-up of future handwashing-with-soap&#13;
behavior change programs, the new project will carry out a structured learning and dissemination&#13;
process to develop and share evidence, practical knowledge, and tools.&#13;
Specific project objectives are to:&#13;
    1. design and support the implementation of innovative, large-scale, sustainable&#13;
       handwashing programs in four diverse countries (Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam);&#13;
    2. document and learn about the impact and sustainability of innovative, large-scale&#13;
       handwashing programs;&#13;
    3. learn about the most effective and sustainable approaches to triggering, scaling-up, and&#13;
       sustaining handwashing behaviors;&#13;
    4. promote and enable the adoption of effective handwashing programs in other countries&#13;
       and position handwashing as a global public health priority through the translation of&#13;
       results and lessons learned into effective advocacy and applied knowledge and&#13;
       communication products.&#13;
The project is designed to achieve key targets in each country at the end of two years of&#13;
implementation. The specific handwashing targets for each country can be found in Table 2. The&#13;
target audience is defined as poor women of childbearing age (15â&#128;&#147;49) and poor children ages 5â&#128;&#147;9.&#13;

Country Context: Vietnam&#13;
Vietnam is a fast-developing country with a total population of 84 million. 2 More than 25&#13;
percent of this population is under 14 years old. Growth is continuing to fuel a rapid transition&#13;
toward a market economy with progressive adoption of demand-responsive approaches and&#13;
decentralized governance. 3&#13;
Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s geography is rather complex, with four geographic areas ranging from rugged&#13;
mountains to marshy fertile flatlands. About 73 percent of the population live in the rural areas.&#13;
The country is home to over 54 ethnic minorities, accounting for 12.7 percent of the national&#13;
population and more than a dozen distinct languages and numerous dialects, reflecting the&#13;
country's ethnic complexity. 87 percent of the population are of the same ethnic group and speak&#13;
the same language. 4 The ethnic minorities are concentrated in certain geographic regions&#13;
including rural, mountainous areas. 5&#13;
The number of deaths due to diarrhea and acute respiratory infections per 100,000 people are&#13;
1.16 and 0.2, respectively. 6 Diarrhea-caused diseases and acute respiratory infections have not&#13;
reduced in recent years, suggesting a need to improve both hygiene and the water supply in&#13;
Vietnam. 7 Knowledge of oral rehydration salts is high in Vietnam. 8 This can contribute to the&#13;
low diarrheal mortality. The rate of malnutrition of children under five in 2006 reduced&#13;
countrywide by 1.8 percent from 2005, but was still at high at 23.4 percent, with an estimated 1.8&#13;
million children who were malnourished. 9 Sustainable access to improved sanitation is estimated&#13;
to be 88 percent in urban areas and 51 percent in rural areas, with an average five-year increase&#13;

with an average five-year increase of approximately 4 percent and 8 percent, respectively. 11&#13;
Handwashing Context&#13;
Several studies on handwashing in Vietnam reveal that handwashing with soap is not a habit. A&#13;
December 2006 Ministry of Health (MOH) study in 10 villages in North Vietnam to observe the&#13;
rate of handwashing with soap of 1,170 people showed that only 6.1 percent of observed people&#13;
wash their hand with soap before eating, 0.8 percent after urinating, and 14.6 percent after&#13;
defecating. Rates of mothers and caregivers with children under five who wash their hands with&#13;
soap are also very low: 2.6 percent before feeding a child and 16.1 percent after disposing of a&#13;
childâ&#128;&#153;s fecal matter. In public areas such as schools and village health stations, the study&#13;
observed that 2.5 percent wash their hands after using the toilet: 2.3 percent in kindergarten, 15&#13;
percent at village heath stations, and 0 percent in school, most wash their hands with water only.&#13;
A 2006 WSP study revealed limited knowledge of the benefits and negative attitude toward&#13;
handwashing with soap. According to this study, handwashing with soap is considered time&#13;
consuming and inconvenient. Reportedly, soap is only necessary when hands are visibly dirty or&#13;
smell bad, and using soap gets rid of unpleasant odors but does little else.&#13;
These same studies show that knowledge of handwashing with soap is still limited for the&#13;
majority of poor people. Moreover, even people who know about the benefits of handwashing&#13;
with soap do not appear to have the habit of washing their hands.&#13;
Furthermore, a 2005 United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF) study showed that 58 percent of&#13;
rural people have access to clean water. 12 Of the 35,000 main schools in Vietnam, 65 percent&#13;
have access to clean water and 41 percent have sanitation facilities. Handwashing facilities were&#13;
not commonly provided in schools. Although handwashing training has been included in the&#13;
school education curriculum for kindergarten and years 1 through 5, reportedly, handwashing has&#13;
still been limited because of the lack of handwashing facilities in schools. Current school training&#13;
programs on handwashing have not been shown to effectively change handwashing practices in&#13;
students.&#13;
In communities, government agencies report that the promotion of handwashing has been&#13;
incorporated into the curricula of many other health programs, such as those concerned with the&#13;
prevention of malnutrition, with water and sanitation, with prevention of SARS, and so on. Also&#13;
observed households had soap placed where it could not be easily accessed for handwashing&#13;
after defecation.&#13;
A recent study on HWWS in 10 northern villages carried out by Unilever discovered that 0.8&#13;
percent of persons interviewed wash their hands with soap after urinating; 14.6 percent wash&#13;
their hands with soap after defecating; 2.6 percent, 10.5 percent and 16.1 percent of mothers with&#13;
children under 5 wash their hands with soap before feeding their children, after help children&#13;

&amp;#12;with urinating/defecating, and after disposing of feces, respectively. 13 Furthermore, at schools,&#13;
health posts, and Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee offices, it was revealed that 2.5 percent of people wash&#13;
their hands with soap after defecating (2.3 percent of whom were kindergarten students) and 6.3&#13;
percent wash their hands with soap after urinating at health posts. This study also indicates that&#13;
access to soap and water is lacking in schools, but not in households: 90 percent of households in&#13;
the study village had access to water; about 50 percent of the households had handwashing&#13;
stations that were less than 5 meters from the toilet. A higher rate of handwashing related to a&#13;
higher level of education, higher family income, and closer location of soap to the toilet. The&#13;
easy availability of soap significantly increased the rate of handwashing. Good knowledge of&#13;
handwashing also played an important part in increasing handwashing compliance. At schools,&#13;
HWWS was low because of a lack of soap and water and also because of the studentsâ&#128;&#153; attitude&#13;
toward handwashing. In households, the rate of handwashing in students was still low although&#13;
soap and water was available; reasons for this could include lack of habit and inconvenience.&#13;
Vietnam Handwashing Initiatives&#13;
There are presently two Handwashing Initiatives ongoing in Vietnam: The National&#13;
Handwashing Initiative supported by WSP with funding from the Danish Embassy and the Gates&#13;
Foundation and the â&#128;&#156;Share Love Not Germsâ&#128;? campaign supported by Unilever.&#13;
The WSP-supported Handwashing Initiative has been active since January 2006. This program is&#13;
in the pilot stage. It is a coordinated effort under MOH leadership and with collaboration from&#13;
the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union, soap manufacturers, and other handwashing players. Funding for this WSP-&#13;
supported Handwashing Initiative comes from two main sources: US$1 million for project&#13;
implementation from December 2006 to December 2008 from the Danish Embassy, and US$1.6&#13;
million from the Gates Foundation Scaling Up Handwashing Project from December 2006 to&#13;
December 2009.&#13;
The WSP Handwashing Initiative plans to utilize national- and community-level behavior&#13;
change communication techniques to influence the behavior of mothers of children under five&#13;
years old and primary school children.&#13;
The WSP Handwashing Initiative hosted a workshop in January 2007 to discuss the research&#13;
conducted from two studies: one supported by WSP on the demand for HWWS, and another&#13;
study supported by a PPP partner to examine the supply side of soap access in Vietnam. This&#13;
workshop provided the first opportunity for initial handwashing players to work collaboratively.&#13;
These players included the WSP/World Bank, the MOH, the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union, International&#13;
Development Enterprise, other international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), Unilever,&#13;
the Asian Development Bank, UNICEF, and DANIDA.&#13;
Under Danish funding, activities will be carried out in 40 communes of eight districts in eight&#13;
provinces: four in the northâ&#128;&#148;Son La, Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Nghe An; two in the centerâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Binh Dinh and Ninh Thuan; and two in the southâ&#128;&#148;Vinh Long and Dong Thap. Project&#13;
implementation site selection criteria included provinces that (1) represent the eight ecological&#13;
regions in Vietnam, (2) have high diarrheal disease rate, (3) have unimproved environmental&#13;

portion of funding had not been finalized, but there was support from the MOH and WSP to&#13;
scale up handwashing activities in the same eight provinces listed above.&#13;
The Unilever-supported â&#128;&#156;Share Love Not Germsâ&#128;? campaign has been designed and carried out in&#13;
conjunction with the MOH Department of Preventive Medicine (DPM). This program is in the&#13;
implementation stage. Total funding for the Unilever-supported campaign is US$2.6 million for&#13;
five years (2006â&#128;&#147;10), of which $1.5 million is spent directly on MOH activities. This campaign&#13;
is also focused on changing HWWS rates in project areas. Since May 2006, HWWS messages&#13;
have been aired via mass media through national television, Voice of Viet Nam Radio and the&#13;
Viet Nam News Agency. HWWS messages transmitted via interpersonal communications have&#13;
been included in road shows and other community communication activities. The Unilever team&#13;
cooperated with the MOH to offer advice on marketing, new handwashing products, and&#13;
advertisements, as well as material development and production, provincial and district launches,&#13;
private events, and other mechanisms in the 10 pilot provinces. Program work in the field is still&#13;
in its infancy, so no studies have yet been conducted. The WSP-supported Handwashing&#13;
Initiative pilot provinces are using the same social marketing approaches to change behavior as&#13;
the Unilever-supported work.&#13;
In 2006, two studies were conducted on HWWS. The first study, funded by WSP, recorded&#13;
current rates of observed and reported handwashing, explored barriers and motivations to&#13;
handwashing, and examined channels of communication among mothers of children under five.&#13;
The second study, supported by the Asian Development Bank with funding from the United&#13;
Kingdomâ&#128;&#153;s Department for International Development (DFID), examined to what extent (1) the&#13;
lack of access to soap was a barrier to handwashing, and (2) if and how the poor could&#13;
participate in the soap distribution system.&#13;
Rationale for Enabling Environment Assessment&#13;
It is essential that certain factors and elements be in place to facilitate the success of the&#13;
sustainability and scalability of the WSP Vietnam Handwashing Initiative. These enabling&#13;
environment factors can ensure that the Handwashing Initiative has the desired impact, achieves&#13;
the desired outcomes, follows an efficient and effective process, and can be scaled up and&#13;
sustained. This assessment has been designed and carried out, therefore, to examine the extent to&#13;
which these factors and elements are in place and what might need to be put in place.&#13;

&amp;#12;2. Scalability and Sustainability&#13;
The ultimate question in any health practice program is how can the health behaviorâ&#128;&#148;in this&#13;
case HWWSâ&#128;&#148;be sustained and scaled up once a project is over? It should be clearly noted that&#13;
scalability and sustainability have not, historically, been possible without some initial&#13;
investments in products, training, capacity-building, structure reinforcement, communication&#13;
skills, and so on. Ensuring and promoting scalability and sustainability requires an examination&#13;
of the contextual settingâ&#128;&#148;that is, recent decentralization of the regions and districts, political&#13;
course, networks, and existing structures, as well as programmatic conditions such as&#13;
institutional capacity, availability of financing, and behavioral requisites such as availability of&#13;
all the needed products and materials to practice the behavior, and the ability and willingness of&#13;
the population to use these. 14 It should also be kept in mind that sustainability should be the first&#13;
goal of any project or program, and then scalability can be sought. If structures, capacity, or&#13;
health practices cannot be sustained even on a small scale, there is no point in considering&#13;
scaling up those same structures, capacities, or practices.&#13;
To place this enabling environment baseline assessment in context, it is important to understand&#13;
the use of the terms scalability and sustainability as they relate to creating, supporting, and&#13;
maintaining a programmatic and behavioral enabling environment. For purposes of this&#13;
assessment, the following definitions have been used:&#13;
Sustainability is the ability of a country, with minimal or no outside financial or technical&#13;
assistance, to continue the work needed to (1) encourage and maintain a health concept/practice,&#13;
(2) increase and maintain the number of people using or practicing promoted program behaviors,&#13;
and (3) implement the program(s) needed to encourage, maintain, and increase the behavior.15&#13;
Scalability is increasing the present scale and rate of behavior change. It is moving a program,&#13;
practice, or methodology use and application from a small scaleâ&#128;&#148;that is, a few regions, a few&#13;
villages, or several districts, reaching a small portion of the population/potential target audience,&#13;
to large scaleâ&#128;&#148;that is, national coverage, the majority of the districts or villages, reaching the&#13;
majority of the population/potential target audience. 16&#13;

&amp;#12;3. Assessment Methodology&#13;
In order to ensure consistency in the assessment findings, the WSP has developed a conceptual&#13;
framework for assessing scalability and sustainability. This framework was developed based on a&#13;
review of relevant literature and discussions with key individuals.&#13;
Dimension Descriptions&#13;
The framework comprises nine dimensions that are considered essential to scaling up a&#13;
handwashing-with-soap behavior change program.&#13;
Policy, Strategy, and Direction: Establishing a shared vision and strategy and ensuring the&#13;
political will to implement them is the starting point for scale up. Without political will and a&#13;
shared vision and strategy among stakeholders at all levels, scale up will remain an elusive goal.&#13;
Developing this shared vision and strategy in a collaborative manner is also the foundation for&#13;
coordination and for creating motivation all levels.&#13;
Partnerships: This handwashing-with-soap program model is based on a establishing a public-&#13;
private partnership. A partnership is a relationship where two or more parties, having compatible&#13;
goals, form an agreement to share the work, share the risk, share the power, and share the results&#13;
or proceeds. Partnerships need to be built at all levels among public, private, and NGO sectors&#13;
and between communities and local governments.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements: Institutions at all levels must clearly understand their roles,&#13;
responsibilities, and authority. They must also have the resources to carry out their roles. In&#13;
addition to clear roles and responsibilities, institutional arrangements must include the&#13;
mechanisms for actors at all levels to coordinate their activities.&#13;
Program Methodology: Handwashing-with-soap programs have a seven-step program&#13;
methodology. This methodology, adapted to each country context, should be clear and agreed&#13;
upon by all key stakeholders.&#13;
Implementation Capacity: In addition to clearly defined institutional roles and responsibilities,&#13;
institutions at all levels must have the capacity to carry out their roles and responsibilities.&#13;
Institutional capacity includes adequate human resources with the full range of skills required to&#13;
carry out their functions; an â&#128;&#156;organizational homeâ&#128;? within the institution that has the assigned&#13;
responsibility; mastery of the agreed-upon program methodology, systems, and procedures&#13;
required for implementation; and the ability to monitor program effectiveness and make&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
Availability of Products and Tools: A handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program is&#13;
predicated on the existence of the soap that responds to consumer preferences and their&#13;
willingness and ability to pay for them. In addition, handwashing station suppliesâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
plastic basins, towels, and so onâ&#128;&#148;need to be easily available.&#13;
Financing: This dimension is aimed at assessing the adequacy of arrangements for financing the&#13;
programmatic costs. These costs include training, staff salaries, transportation, office equipment&#13;
and supplies, and the development of communication and educational materials as well as&#13;
programmatic line items in budgets for handwashing-promotion activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Cost-Effective Implementation: The potentially high costs of promoting handwashing-with-&#13;
soap behavior at scale make cost-effective implementation a key element. It is essential to&#13;
understand how the unit costs change as activities are scaled up. Although it will not be possible&#13;
to assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach and how best to achieve economies of scale until&#13;
the end of the project, data must still be collected during implementation to make this&#13;
determination at the end of the project. Therefore, this assessment will try to ensure that&#13;
information will be collected from the outset and that the capacity to collect the information is in&#13;
place.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation: A large-scale handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program&#13;
requires regular monitoring and, perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability to use the&#13;
monitoring process to make adjustments in the program. Effective monitoring will identify&#13;
strengths and weaknesses in the program methodology, implementation arrangements, and cost&#13;
efficiencies. Overall monitoring responsibility must be at the highest level of the program, but&#13;
must be based on information collected at the local government or district level.&#13;
Characteristics for Scalability and Sustainability&#13;
When assessing the status of and changes needed to an enabling environment, it is equally useful&#13;
to look at these dimensions from a scalability and sustainability perspective. Table 3 broadly&#13;
delineates the characteristics for scalability and sustainability by enabling environment&#13;
dimension. 17 The characteristics and qualities listed in the table represent the â&#128;&#156;idealâ&#128;? conditions&#13;
required to scale up a program and ensure its sustainability. 18 Several of the characteristics also&#13;
include an explanation of the usefulness of the characteristic when deemed necessary to overall&#13;
comprehension of the characteristic; that is, the characteristicâ&#128;&#148;partnership of major&#13;
governmental, international, indigenous, commercial/private, and NGOs/agencies has been&#13;
formed; usefulnessâ&#128;&#148;extending reach and increasing resources. 19 In addition to the&#13;
characteristics listed in Table 3, research has shown that several qualities have proven to increase&#13;
the effectiveness of developing, managing, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating&#13;
programs to ensure scale is possible and programs and practices are sustained. 20 These qualities&#13;
include ownership, participatory decision-making, openness and inclusiveness, and valuing and&#13;
respect.&#13;

  Characteristics refer to/connote the distinctiveness, identifiers, traits of each of the nine dimensions of an enabling&#13;
environment that if in place will promote and ensure that a program, practice, effective behavior change&#13;
methodology can and will be sustained and scaled up.&#13;
19&#13;
  While some characteristics can overlap in both scalability and sustainability, e.g., â&#128;&#156;Health practice has been&#13;
designated a priority by the government,â&#128;? each characteristic has been placed in only one column to facilitate&#13;

&amp;#12;4. Assessment Design and Purpose&#13;
To assess to what extent the conditions for scale up and sustainability are in place at the&#13;
beginning of this Vietnam Handwashing Initiative and, based on these baseline assessment&#13;
findings, recommend what should be done to address the gaps during project implementation, the&#13;
assessment applied these specific assessment objectives:&#13;
       1. determine what is presently in place/happening under each dimension;&#13;
       2. detail the level of the program to be carried out, that is, pilot, expansion, national, and so&#13;
          on;&#13;
       3. identify strengths and weaknesses of each dimension, with a focus on deficiencies;&#13;
       4. establish the baseline against which the enabling environment will be assessed at the end&#13;
          of this project;&#13;
       5. make recommendations for improvements to the enabling environment over the life of&#13;
          the project to the country task manager, WSP headquarters staff, and main in-country&#13;
          partners;&#13;
       6. obtain consensus among current partnering organizations for recommendations and next&#13;
          steps.&#13;
Data Collection: Methodology&#13;
Qualitative in-depth interviews were designed around the nine dimensions. Project documents&#13;
were reviewed and discussed with selected handwashing players and program staff. Site field&#13;
visits were also conducted. Analysis of results and presentation of findings identified trends in&#13;
the qualitative data. Quantitative surveys were not used, because the infancy of the WSP-&#13;
supported Handwashing Initiative did not provide sufficient experience for organizations to&#13;
complete the survey and there was repeated confusion between the two different â&#128;&#156;Initiativesâ&#128;? so&#13;
that respondents were unsure which initiative they were assessing. 22&#13;
Data Collection: Sources and Selection&#13;
Data sources comprised government agencies, international agencies, international NGOs, and&#13;
private sector businesses. All sources were selected based on availability and convenience to&#13;
interview, interviewing at least 25 percent of each stakeholder type. When possible, national-,&#13;
provincial-, district-, and communal-level staff and personnel were interviewed.&#13;
Table 4 indicates which type of stakeholder was interviewed on which dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
     The Handwashing Initiative could consider administering these quantitative surveys mid-project.&#13;

&#13;
The assessment was carried out from July 2 to July 27, 2007 by the two-person WSP consultant&#13;
team of Lynne Cogswell and Le Thi Anh Thu. They performed the following tasks:&#13;
    1. They conducted 33 group or individual interviews with stakeholders at national,&#13;
       provincial, district, village, and household levels. Box 1 lists the 19 handwashing&#13;
       organizations and agencies in Vietnam that were interviewed during this assessment.&#13;
    2. They conducted field visits to Dong Thap and Binh Dinh (two of the program provinces).&#13;
    3. They held a partner debriefing with 32 representatives of handwashing players in&#13;
       Vietnam, reached understanding on preliminary findings and recommendations, formed a&#13;
       seven-person handwashing task force, and discussed and agreed upon immediate next&#13;
       steps (from August 1 to September 30, 2007).&#13;

&amp;#12;5. Findings and Conclusions&#13;
This assessment identified several opportunities and limitations of the enabling environment for&#13;
HWWS in Vietnam. Vietnam has a model of an effectively functioning partnershipâ&#128;&#148;the Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Partnershipâ&#128;&#148;that involves most of the potential partners&#13;
for a Handwashing Initiative, which we can learn and benefit from. 23 The political will is evident&#13;
and can provide the springboard for moving HWWS forward. Table 5 provides a synthesis of&#13;
key findings by dimension.&#13;

Policy, Strategy, and Direction: Findings&#13;
Interviews with government agencies, NGOs, and private sector players indicate that political&#13;
will to promote HWWS at the national, provincial, district, and communal level exists. A model&#13;
of no-subsidy exists in Vietnam through the Population Services Internationalâ&#128;&#153;s (PSI) program,&#13;
SafeWat product, though the assessment team identified no formal policy position on&#13;
handwashing subsidies.&#13;
The Government of Vietnam (GOV) approved the Danish Embassy portion of the WSP-&#13;
supported Handwashing Initiative in July 2007 and gave approval for work to move forward.&#13;
Furthermore, data indicates that rural areas, 24 site of apparently more than 50 percent of the&#13;
present Handwashing Initiative work, have the fastest-growing populations and have the most-&#13;
neglected policy formulation. The team was unable to identify significant information on&#13;
handwashing policy and identified insufficient data to prepare a position paper.&#13;
The MOH reported that it is in the process of developing national guidelines for medical&#13;
handwashing and for handwashing in communities. No clear idea on when these guidelines&#13;
would be completed and provided to all levels was given, but the MOH stated that these&#13;
guidelines would include how to wash hands, when to wash hands, and why to wash hands.&#13;
The team identified no legal frameworks or existing government mechanisms to research and&#13;
find answers concerning new issues such as HWWS. In an interview, NGO â&#128;&#156;representatives&#13;
stated that most policy position papers are prepared by individuals or quasi-private-sector&#13;
agencies such as research firms upon their own initiative or at the request of an international&#13;
agency and generally not at the request of government ministries.â&#128;?&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;The assessment team reviewed the project implementation plan, and the MOH noted that a&#13;
project implementation plan for the use of Danish Embassy funds, a separate proposal for the use&#13;
of Gates Foundation funds, and a WSP project implementation plan combining activities are in&#13;
place. Most interviewees stated that the development of a national, unifying HWWS strategy has&#13;
not been discussed. The majority of interviewees, in particular the NGOs, stated that most&#13;
handwashing work being conducted is based on individual organizational agency and department&#13;
plans and strategies. The WSP-supported Handwashing Initiative handwashing coordinator noted&#13;
that the Gates-funded portion of the work had not yet been approved by the GOV, slowing the&#13;
start up of activities. The MOH confirmed that GOV approval is required for each project or&#13;
proposal, and minimal work takes place without it or while waiting for this approval, particularly&#13;
for activities that are GOV-leadâ&#128;&#148;as with the Handwashing Initiative.&#13;
No government agencies, NGOs, or private sector respondents identified a common vision&#13;
beyond increasing the rates of handwashing in the population of Vietnam. Most stated that the&#13;
idea of a common vision had not been discussed individually or collectively. Government&#13;
agencies reported that WSP- Handwashing Initiative project objectives had been established, but&#13;
that they felt these objectives were not necessarily based on the realities of the country context&#13;
and present behavior status of HWWS, nor were they developed in conjunction with other&#13;
implementing handwashing organizations or agencies. Most NGOs and several government&#13;
agencies also expressed disappointment that the WSP-Handwashing Initiative was not focusing&#13;
on or including work with schools and schoolchildren. The MOH reported being unsure when or&#13;
if schoolchildren would be considered, even though the WSP-supported project implementation&#13;
plan states that the Handwashing Initiative will target schoolchildren in 2008.&#13;
The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) reported that it had included handwashing in&#13;
its Life Skills curricula for schoolchildren aged 7 to 12. Several other agenciesâ&#128;&#148;such as the&#13;
Center for Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation (CERWASS), Plan International,&#13;
and Church World Services (CWS) also stated that handwashing had been integrated into their&#13;
ongoing water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion work.&#13;
Many NGOs felt that HWWS should be integrated into other activities, such as nutrition, as well&#13;
as across sectors, such as literacy and agriculture, expressing the concern that as a stand-alone&#13;
program or set of activitiesâ&#128;&#148;although it might in the initial six months to one year have some&#13;
impact on behaviorâ&#128;&#148;it could not be sustained, behaviorally or programmatically, Also, based on&#13;
discussions with WSP Vietnam, integration of water, sanitation, and hygiene programs appears&#13;
to be the operational normâ&#128;&#148;that is, none of these activities are carried out as stand-alone or&#13;
single activities, either in Vietnam or regionally. It is clear that; that water, sanitation, and&#13;
hygiene activitiesâ&#128;&#148;including handwashingâ&#128;&#148;are an integrated, larger portfolio of activities&#13;
within WSP Vietnam.&#13;
Policy, Strategy, and Direction: Conclusions&#13;
The Policy, Strategy, and Direction of a Vietnam HWWS Initiative as an eventual national&#13;
program are not clear to present and potential handwashing players. There is a lack of&#13;
understanding that the WSP-Handwashing Initiative is intended to be more than a two-year&#13;
project. There was no clear vision that HWWS is to be sustained and scaled up. No national&#13;
strategy or plan of action is being discussed. No HWWS policies are in place, though&#13;
handwashing guidelines are being developed by the MOH. Limited integration is taking place.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;There is a willingness to conduct and/or include handwashing activities among different&#13;
organizations and agencies and at different levels.&#13;
There is a perceived need for this national strategy to both sustain and scale up HWWS.&#13;
However, the misunderstanding of the WSP- Handwashing Initiative project intentâ&#128;&#148;that is, the&#13;
projectâ&#128;&#153;s goal of being a sustainable, scalable part of a larger water and sanitation programâ&#128;&#148;has&#13;
limited discussion among handwashing players of the need for and the development of an&#13;
overarching, national HWWS strategy.&#13;
There is insufficient data to write a handwashing position paper at this time. And although the&#13;
paper alone would be insufficient to constitute an advocacy strategy, with the partnership of a&#13;
handwashing coordinating committee, this position paper could lay the groundwork for a&#13;
handwashing policy that is integrated into a larger water and sanitation policy.&#13;
HWWS needs to become part of the established GOV policy on water and sanitation. To&#13;
influence handwashing policy in Vietnam requires:&#13;
   1. a study supporting the value and importance of handwashing as a public health priority;&#13;
   2. a written policy positionâ&#128;&#148;particularly one demonstrating the integration of handwashing&#13;
      into a larger water and sanitation programâ&#128;&#148;that suggests a policy and national strategy&#13;
      presented to parliament;&#13;
   3. review and approval by parliament; and&#13;
   4. a parliamentary decree stating that handwashing is to be integrated into the larger water&#13;
      and sanitation work, budgeted for, and viewed as a public health priority. This final&#13;
      decree would ensure sustainability of integrated handwashing activities and program and&#13;
      would facilitate scale up.&#13;
Present ongoing initiatives need to come together around a common vision and common&#13;
objectives, and to express a common key message. Research and policy reform needs to be&#13;
initiated by the MOH. This will not only demonstrate ownership of the work to be done, but will&#13;
demonstrate an understanding of the need for written policy to sustain a public health priority.&#13;
An approved national HWWS strategy into which donors could inject funds to accomplish&#13;
collaboratively agreed upon objectives and activities could increase the likelihood of sustained&#13;
and scalable activities and behaviors. Handwashing should be part of an overall policy on water&#13;
and sanitation, since the successful and sustained behavior change depend on water and&#13;
sanitation. This can occur as part of WSP Vietnam support to update the RWSS and the&#13;
development of a Unified Sanitation Strategy. In this way, handwashing can reach parliamentary&#13;
levels as part of the larger context of water and sanitation.&#13;
Partnerships: Findings&#13;
All government agencies and NGOs stated that there was a loose grouping of coordinating&#13;
agencies for the WSP Handwashing Initiative; none of them felt they had played a significant&#13;
part in providing program advice. Key coordinating agencies indicated that â&#128;&#156;no partnership&#13;
presently existsâ&#128;? and that they felt the WSP Handwashing Initiative is â&#128;&#156;a one-shot, two-year&#13;
project,â&#128;? neither an ongoing program to be sustained and expanded nor a partnership.&#13;
Discussions with the Handwashing Initiative country coordinator indicated that Vietnam as a&#13;
social government relies on consensus-based decision-making, which makes it impossible for&#13;
                                                23&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;both domestic, including government agencies, and international institutions to carry out&#13;
activities without proper protocol and agreement from all sides. To lead the handwashing&#13;
program, the MOH required approval from the prime ministerâ&#128;&#153;s office to carry out the&#13;
handwashing activities funded by the Danish Embassy, since funds are directly managed by the&#13;
GOV. No formal governmental approval was required for the Gates-supported activities, since&#13;
WSP will manage these activities. The approval from the prime ministerâ&#128;&#153;s office came in July&#13;
2007; the approval from the MOH for the Center for Environment and Community Health&#13;
(CECH) to lead this program came in early September 2007. Most activities were therefore&#13;
delayed until that time, including the development of a partnership, because without this mandate,&#13;
as stated in an interview, â&#128;&#156;the MOH would have refused to lead a partnership and other&#13;
government and NGO players would not have been bold enough to form a partnership and lead&#13;
without official government approval.â&#128;?&#13;
All respondents noted that there exists a functioning partnershipâ&#128;&#148;the RWSS Partnershipâ&#128;&#148;of&#13;
which many are members. The Ministry of Agriculture and Development (MARD), in&#13;
conjunction with more than 75 percent of those organizations and agencies interviewed, formed a&#13;
RWSS Partnership in 2006 to implement the GOV water and sanitation National Target Program&#13;
II (NTP II) goals and objectives. 25 Partnership documents indicate that this partnership has been&#13;
successful in fundraising, expanding its reach, and coordinating directed actions to meet specific&#13;
targets and achieve defined outcomes. 26 The majority of member organizations and agencies&#13;
interviewed substantiated this documentation claim. Furthermore, those interviewedâ&#128;&#148;who were&#13;
also members of this partnershipâ&#128;&#148;indicated that it had pulled together all players under one&#13;
umbrella and provide a structured funding mechanism for donors, ensuring that all donors fund a&#13;
strategy agreed upon by the partnership and already approved by the GOV, thus â&#128;&#156;not slowing&#13;
down implementation or moving forward.â&#128;? Documentation further indicated that it took two&#13;
years for this partnership to be organized and formed, and that the partnership is managed and&#13;
directed by a four-person staff contracted by and housed in MARD. Many NGOs and several&#13;
government agencies felt that the Handwashing Initiative should consider using the RWSS&#13;
Partnership as a possible model for a handwashing partnership or as a possible vehicle for&#13;
HWWS activities.&#13;
Most government agencies reported a history of collaboration when carrying out health activities&#13;
among levels and sectors, and the assessment team experienced this collaboration in the efficient,&#13;
coordinated organization of field interviews and visits by government agencies. Provincial-,&#13;
district- and commune-level government agencies stated that there is also a collaboration and&#13;
cooperation in carrying out communication activitiesâ&#128;&#148;such as mobilization, community events,&#13;
and so onâ&#128;&#148;among unions, Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee Medical Offices, the MOH DPM, and&#13;
Department of Health Communication and Education (DHCE). They reported that this&#13;
collaboration included developing health messages and contextually appropriate materials as&#13;
well as training motivators and village volunteers and conducting activities. The majority of&#13;
NGOs interviewed stated that this level of participation and activity varied by district and&#13;
commune depending on the commitment and the capacity of the government agency staff&#13;
involved.&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Most interviewed organizations and agencies stated they felt there had been minimal&#13;
participation in handwashing discussion and decisions. Furthermore, most reported that they felt&#13;
a need for a common focus and defined roles and responsibilities to â&#128;&#156;avoid turf battles.â&#128;?&#13;
Government agencies indicated that this is the way in which the ministries, the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Committee, and the unions function on a normal basis with other health issues and programs. A&#13;
few indicated that this is not always successful, but that they felt that no clear delineation of roles&#13;
â&#128;&#156;could only further confuse the issues, and subsequently reduce the impact of activities.â&#128;?&#13;
However, it was acknowledged by all interviewed that â&#128;&#156;partnerships, while useful, can, in&#13;
reality, prove as challenging to organize and manage as the actual programs themselves.â&#128;?&#13;
Interviews identified common values of partnerships as cited by government agencies, NGOs,&#13;
and private sector players. The most commonly cited value of a partnership was behavior change&#13;
mind sharing; others included accumulated critical mass of sector knowledge, increased&#13;
efficiency, reduction of duplication and redundancies, enhanced knowledge, improved practice,&#13;
and promotion of wider collaboration. According to most sources interviewed, â&#128;&#156;a partnership can&#13;
effectively and efficiently provide promotion, product, place, and price.â&#128;?&#13;
The majority of organizations and agencies interviewed felt that the MOH should appropriately&#13;
continue as the lead agency with a strong role in training, capacity-building, and communication&#13;
being played by the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union because of â&#128;&#156;its reach, capacity, and influence in the field.â&#128;?&#13;
Many interviewed NGOs stated they would be unable to take a major role because their staffing&#13;
and capacity was limited, but that they would be willing to assist with the development,&#13;
integration, and utilization of strategy-defined materials and messages. Documentation indicated&#13;
that contacts among the handwashing community were strong, 27 though not utilized on a regular,&#13;
ongoing basis. Most NGOs felt that a Handwashing Initiative needs to be brought closer to the&#13;
NGO community and â&#128;&#156;viewed as a GOV program.â&#128;? They also reported that, as a strong network&#13;
around other health issues, the NGO community could be used effectively in promoting,&#13;
sustaining, and scaling up HWWS through combined efforts and increased applied resources.&#13;
Extensive interviews with the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union at the national, provincial, district, and commune&#13;
levels revealed that the Unionâ&#128;&#148;with its 13 million membersâ&#128;&#148;has organized functioning&#13;
networks at all levels, networks that perform across sectors and work to integrate all activities.&#13;
The assessment team was unable to interview any representatives from the Farmersâ&#128;&#153; or Youth&#13;
Unions, but reportedly these unions have equally organized multilevel networks, although&#13;
memberships are less and participation may vary depending on the district or commune.&#13;
Partnerships: Conclusions&#13;
Though there is an acknowledged value to a partnership working together collaboratively to&#13;
coordinate activities, no partnership around HWWS has yet been formed. A partnership model is&#13;
in keeping with the manner of functioning in Vietnam and in the region. There exists a strong,&#13;
well-regarded RWSS Partnership. This partnership could possibly serve as the vehicle for&#13;
handwashing activities. The infancy of the WSP-Handwashing Initiative has limited what&#13;
partnership-building could yet have taken place.&#13;
Roles and responsibilities for handwashing government and NGO players need to be detailed to&#13;
reduce potential overlaps in activities and maximize use of resources. The ongoing WSP-&#13;
&#13;

     As reported by the Water and Sanitation Communication Meeting notes, March 2007.&#13;
                                                       25&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;supported and Unilever handwashing initiatives need to come together to share experiences,&#13;
expertise, and lessons learned and to reduce potential confusion for handwashing players and&#13;
communication target audiences. Historical government agency collaboration and cooperation&#13;
need to be accessed and maximized.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements: Findings&#13;
The MOH representatives interviewed felt that they have no clear leadership role in the WSP-&#13;
Handwashing Initiative: â&#128;&#156;WSP makes all the decisions and those decisions are given to us.â&#128;? The&#13;
MOH reported the need for GOV written approval for official work to be conducted as slowed&#13;
down the work and â&#128;&#156;admittedly also affects our leadership role at this time.â&#128;? However,&#13;
government representatives also report that â&#128;&#156;tight control by WSPâ&#128;? has limited their ability to&#13;
assume leadership. Most other government agencies and NGOs interviewed also felt a lack of&#13;
ownership by the MOH as well as by other coordinating agencies and other possible&#13;
handwashing players. The majority of organizations and agencies interviewed stated that â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
MOH needs to be visible in all work conducted and decisions made and maintain the face of the&#13;
HW work as its leader and enabler.â&#128;?&#13;
Most government agencies, including the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee, as well as NGOs interviewed felt&#13;
that many decisionsâ&#128;&#148;for example, roles, objectives, budget, and so onâ&#128;&#148;had been made&#13;
unilaterally, that is, only by the WSP- Handwashing Initiative staff. A few reported that although&#13;
limited discussions have taken placeâ&#128;&#148;for example, discussions on the selection of research firms&#13;
and communication agencies and so onâ&#128;&#148;they often feel â&#128;&#156;that their advice is neither respected or&#13;
followed and that the HWI is â&#128;&#152;going through the motionsâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;¦.â&#128;? One cited example included the&#13;
formative research that the majority of organizations and NGOs familiar with this work (which&#13;
were most of them, as most attended the presentation seminar), including the Handwashing&#13;
Initiative Country Coordinator, reported being dissatisfied with the results. Many stated that, had&#13;
discussions been held on how to present and appropriately utilize the resulting formative&#13;
research findings, there would be more willingness to use these results. Many NGOs also felt&#13;
that audiences who should be involved in program decision making, such as teachers, students,&#13;
mothers, and health workers, had been insufficiently involved to date. The majority of&#13;
government agencies and NGOs, including the MOH, stated that they had not reviewed,&#13;
discussed, or approved the present program objectives under the Scaling Up Handwashing&#13;
Project though they would be â&#128;&#156;expected to implement it in Vietnam.â&#128;?&#13;
Written feedback from the Handwashing Initiative Country Coordinator provides an additional&#13;
perspective on the MOHâ&#128;&#153;s program leadership to date. 28 The Coordinator reports that from July&#13;
to December 2006, the WSP Handwashing Initiative went from minimal seed funding to a duel&#13;
donorâ&#128;&#147;funded program with two donors investing almost US$3 million for program activities,&#13;
with each donor utilizing different modes of operation and disbursement. In July, the Danish&#13;
Embassy agreed that WSP and the MOH should split the Embassy-provided US$1 million to&#13;
ensure completion of originally agreed upon activitiesâ&#128;&#148;that is, one-third to be WSP-managed&#13;
and two-thirds to be MOH-managed. In November, the Gates Foundation provided an additional&#13;
US$2 million, but requested that WSP manage 100 percent of these funds. MOH counterparts,&#13;
who have limited experience with World Bank/WSP operations and disbursements, are now&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;dealing with two donors (WSP/World Bank and the Danish Embassy). The WSP-supported&#13;
program brought the new technical approach of social marketing, and a new partnership (PPP)&#13;
way of working, with the result that â&#128;&#156;all of this combined, has been a huge learning curve for&#13;
both the MOH and WSP.â&#128;?&#13;
Furthermore, the Handwashing Initiative Country Coordinator reported that, historically, WSP&#13;
Vietnam has supported activities through the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and, more&#13;
recently, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), both of which&#13;
are the ministries primarily responsible water and sanitation. The WSP had not worked with the&#13;
MOH, who is responsible for hygiene promotion, as the WSP did not have any hygiene&#13;
promotion activities until the Handwashing Initiative began. WSP familiarity with the MOH and&#13;
vice versa has been limited on operations, disbursements, structures, and functioning of both the&#13;
WSP and the MOH.&#13;
According to project plans, the MOH is to hire, for HWWS, a technical officer, a financial&#13;
management/procurement assistant, and a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) officer. 29 The&#13;
assessment team was unable to determine from the project plans whether these posts were to be&#13;
sustainable within the MOH or whether they are life-of-the-project positions. Documentation&#13;
indicated a detailed functioning institutional structure, but the MOH reports that this structure&#13;
has not been established. This structuring includes three levels of interdisciplinary coordination:&#13;
a project management board/MOH and provincial, district, and communal project steering&#13;
committees. These management committees are set up to oversee activities. The Danish Embassy,&#13;
however, reports that this structuring is a direct result of the Danish Embassyâ&#128;&#147;funded portion of&#13;
the WSP-supported Handwashing Initiative, not a result of a perceived need by the MOH.&#13;
The assessment team identified no mechanisms for national-level coordination of HWWS&#13;
activities or programs. No organizations or agencies interviewed, including government entities&#13;
and NGOs, identified any formal or informal interagency or intersector coordination for the&#13;
Handwashing Initiative. Agencies interviewed felt they had been inadequately involved and&#13;
informed, and as such felt unable to sufficiently participate in a handwashing effort at any level.&#13;
It should be noted that all agencies acknowledged the challenges of working within the Vietnam&#13;
approval process; none felt that this was sufficient reason to minimize involvement in planning&#13;
and challenges discussions, but rather â&#128;&#156;a good reason to involve us, as we have all experienced&#13;
similar challenges and could provide advice or at least moral support.â&#128;¦â&#128;?&#13;
Institutional Arrangements: Conclusions&#13;
MOH leadership has been inadequate. This is because of both the lack of delayed GOV approval&#13;
for HWWS activities and the mode of operation that the WSP/World Bank utilizes. The MOH&#13;
has been insufficiently involved in decision making, as have most of the designated coordinating&#13;
agencies, again primarily due to WSP procedures. No formal structure has yet been put in place,&#13;
and MOH coordinating staff has not yet been hired. Although there is a consistency that is&#13;
required under the assumed rigor of the Scaling Up Handwashing Project work, it will be equally&#13;
important to ensure that the objectives and targets are contextually appropriate, feasible, realistic,&#13;
and agreed upon by those expected to achieve them.&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Lack of understanding on how the WSP functions has brought the Handwashing Initiative&#13;
credibility into question. Institutional arrangements and coordination have been minimal, taxing&#13;
the validity and feasibility of an eventual Vietnam HWWS effort. The work needs to be stepped&#13;
up to national-level, moving beyond project implementation and a single organizational focus.&#13;
Now that GOV approval has been received, the MOH leadership role and decision-making&#13;
involvement opportunities need to be created.&#13;
It is evident that there are differing perceptions about what is happening and why; however,&#13;
ultimately all involved parties need to place greater emphasis on communicating concerns and&#13;
reaching agreement. Opportunities need to be created for handwashing players to come together&#13;
and provide advice for a national HWWS effort if the Handwashing Initiative is to move forward&#13;
effectively.&#13;
Program Methodology: Findings&#13;
Handwashing Initiative project documents indicateâ&#128;&#148;and this was confirmed by the&#13;
Handwashing Initiative Country Coordinatorâ&#128;&#148;that the WSP-supported approach advocated&#13;
includes applying social marketing techniques, focusing on behavior change not just&#13;
communication, and building partnerships to carry out and sustain work being done. 30 Most&#13;
organizations and agencies interviewed, with the exception of selected private sector agencies,&#13;
did not understand the social marketing approach or new creative techniques for behavior change.&#13;
Most were unaware, including private sector agencies that the WSP Handwashing Initiative was,&#13;
in theory, meant to be using both social marketing and partnering. 31 Documentation on the&#13;
Unilever-supported Handwashing Initiative also indicates that it employs social marketing&#13;
techniques focused on behavior change, but there was no mention of partnership-building in&#13;
those documents. 32&#13;
Organizations and agencies interviewed stated that no formal examination of approaches and&#13;
techniques used at present in Vietnam has been discussed or carried out. Based on the assessment&#13;
team review of selected activities and materials developed, however, in most cases, these&#13;
activities and materials have utilized traditional health education techniquesâ&#128;&#148;that is, the use of&#13;
health fear as message, talks not dialogue, and so on, rather than incorporating any new behavior&#13;
change techniques or approaches. Most of these same agencies report that they feel their â&#128;&#156;impact&#13;
on handwashing has been minimal using these approaches.â&#128;? Government agencies and selected&#13;
private sector agenciesâ&#128;&#153; interviews indicated that only limited anecdotal information has been&#13;
gathered, and that no analysis of this information has been conducted. The majority of&#13;
interviewees questioned the Handwashing Initiative approach and felt that the sustainability and&#13;
scalability through this approach should be discussed or debated among handwashing players so&#13;
that â&#128;&#156;all can benefit for the learning process.â&#128;? Following several interviews, the assessment team&#13;
took advantage of the opportunity to present and discuss the PPPHW approach more fully, at the&#13;
request of WSP Vietnam, and most interviewed stated they were eager to learn, share, and apply&#13;
new techniques and establish Vietnam best practices for HWWS. Most interviewed reported&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;being ready to try something new and be more creative and progressive. In Ho Chi Minh&#13;
province, the DHCE has already been observably creative in its development and use of HWWS&#13;
activities and messages, from using Chinese fans to pass messages to developing a complete Ho&#13;
Chi Minh province map of handwashing partners and enlisting investments from local private-&#13;
sector manufacturers for in-kind support to share HWWS messages.&#13;
Many government agencies, all NGOs, and several private sector agencies expressed concern&#13;
over the fact that more than one Handwashing Initiative was taking place. The majority felt that&#13;
the target audiences would be confused once the WSP Handwashing Initiative began, especially&#13;
â&#128;&#156;if messages are different, as TV spots are aired nationally, if road shows are taking place in&#13;
some of the same districts, though not the same communes, and if different HWI materials are&#13;
being used in some of the same areasâ&#128;¦.â&#128;? (It should be noted that it was because more than one&#13;
Handwashing Initiative was taking place that the assessment team was unable to administer the&#13;
quantitative surveyâ&#128;&#148;that is, interviewees were confused as to which Handwashing Initiative&#13;
they were to evaluate. When asked which one they were most familiar with and whether they felt&#13;
they could evaluate the initiative, they distinguished between them as â&#128;&#156;Unileverâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s.â&#128;?) Also many government agencies and a few NGOs expressed some confusion over the&#13;
idea of â&#128;&#156;one messageâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;many construed this as â&#128;&#156;one message per provinceâ&#128;? or per district as&#13;
opposed to an overarching key message and effort for the country.&#13;
Program Methodology: Conclusions&#13;
The Vietnam Handwashing Initiatives employ social marketing and behavior change techniques,&#13;
but these techniques are insufficiently understood by involved handwashing players. Program&#13;
methodology employed by government agencies and other NGOs has been traditional and&#13;
inconsistent, with minimal application of new techniques and approaches. Handwashing players&#13;
need to understand the approaches being used, the new techniques and approaches available, and&#13;
how each potentially impacts on changing and sustaining behavior in Vietnam so that a Vietnam&#13;
approach can be developed for use by handwashing players and employed as a key part of a&#13;
national HWWS strategy. Capacity needs to be built in social marketing and behavior change so&#13;
that handwashing players can effectively employ these techniques. An effort needs to be made to&#13;
coordinate the Handwashing Initiatives and reduce confusion among handwashing players.&#13;
Implementation Capacity: Findings&#13;
Existing documentation indicates that â&#128;&#156;capacity to manage large-scale initiatives remains&#13;
weak.â&#128;? 33 Most agencies interviewed stated that handwashing programs rely primarily on outside,&#13;
international expertise and the skills have not been sufficiently internalized. Also all&#13;
organizations and agencies interviewed indicated that, although skills might exist, sufficient staff&#13;
did not. Many felt that if HWWS activities were integrated into their ongoing activities, it would&#13;
â&#128;&#156;help us actually participate and carry out HWWS activities.â&#128;? Based on content discussions with&#13;
the assessment team, expertise exists in evaluation and monitoring at the National Institute of&#13;
Health Education (NIHE); expertise in training, communication, and behavior change exists at&#13;
CERWASS, CWS, Plan International, and UNICEF; and mobilization and motivation skills exist&#13;
at the Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Union. 34 MARD representatives reported that its village volunteer program is a&#13;

     The assessment team was unable to hold â&#128;&#156;contentâ&#128;? discussions with all organizations and agencies.&#13;
                                                          29&#13;

&amp;#12;sustained effort by national agencies and international organizations in water and sanitation to&#13;
put skilled, trained volunteers in place. The assessment team was unable to assess the technology&#13;
capacity.&#13;
Most organizations and agencies interviewed questioned the credibility and appropriateness of a&#13;
national Handwashing Initiative. Government agencies reported that programs had been&#13;
decentralized: (1) the national level provides policy, guidelines, and basic directionâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;promote HWWSâ&#128;?; then (2) the provincial level, in collaboration with district- and communal-&#13;
levels, interprets the direction and develops messages, materials, and activities and implements,&#13;
monitors, and evaluates same. Most agencies interviewed felt that posed a challenge in&#13;
developing a â&#128;&#156;nationalâ&#128;? handwashing communication package, utilizing the same key message&#13;
and materials. Most staff interviewed at the provincial, district, and communal levels felt that&#13;
significant adaptation would be required to effectively use a nationally developed key message&#13;
and materials.&#13;
Provincial and district government representatives detailed the government operational five-level&#13;
structure: national, provincial, district, commune, and village. Furthermore, they described how&#13;
this structure functions. Each level, while following a national policy when available, appears to&#13;
have autonomy in implementation of this policy, though often following the provincial-level lead.&#13;
Department of Health (DOH) staff in the provinces stated that, while they had been informed of&#13;
their participation in the pilot activities from the MOH, since they are organized and staffed by&#13;
the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee in each province, they also needed permission from them before they&#13;
could proceed, and that â&#128;&#156;we will not follow the MOH if the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee in the province&#13;
does not agree.â&#128;?&#13;
Government agencies stated that surveillance and disease prevention activities are conducted by&#13;
the MOH network of preventive medicine through the DPM at national, provincial, district, and&#13;
communal levels. Also they noted that the grassroots medical network is implemented by the&#13;
Medical Office of the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee to guarantee that prevention activities reach local&#13;
people. Government agencies did, however, report that even though the government network&#13;
covers from the central to the local level, there is insufficient organization of the system and&#13;
overlapping roles and responsibilities of government agencies at different levels and in multiple&#13;
sectors.&#13;
All organizations and agencies interviewed reported that training in social marketing, behavior&#13;
change communication, HWWS essentials, and so on has been insufficient or nonexistent to date.&#13;
The assessment team was unable to identify any guidelines specific to training, to M&amp;E, or to&#13;
behavior change communication techniques. The team did identify some limited training&#13;
materials through the DOH covering traditional health education principles and techniques. The&#13;
MOET also stated that, though it works regularly with children, its staff felt â&#128;&#156;inadequate to&#13;
incorporate new techniques and uncomfortable moving beyond the traditional.â&#128;?&#13;
 In 2006, AusAid conducted a water, sanitation, and hygiene materials audit, examining what&#13;
materials existed and investigating the distribution, dissemination, and storage systems for these&#13;
same materials. 35 This study demonstrated the lack of systems for the effective use of materials,&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;stating that in many cases materials were stockpiled in the provincial storage depots, never going&#13;
out further as most had no clear idea what they were expected to do with these materials. The&#13;
report also stated that no instructions were found on how to display or use these materials with&#13;
clients.&#13;
Implementation Capacity: Conclusions&#13;
Implementation capacity is weak. Human resources are insufficient and training in needed topics,&#13;
such as behavior change communication has been limited. Capacity-building is required at all&#13;
levels. More involvement needs to be created to ensure provincial- and district-level buy-in.&#13;
Participation needs to be established at all levels to ensure successful sustainability and&#13;
scalability of HWWS. All levels need to understand the purpose of a â&#128;&#156;national handwashing&#13;
initiativeâ&#128;? and their respective roles, and then they need to be trained to effectively fulfill those&#13;
roles and how to make the best use of a national strategy.&#13;
A full mapping of existing skills needs to be completed, after which an appropriate capacity-&#13;
building plan can be developed for all levels. The extent to which existing expertise, volunteer&#13;
networks, and behavior change communication experience can be utilized is limited by the staff&#13;
available. In this initial start-up stage, significant technical assistance will be required, but it&#13;
needs to be coupled with handwashing partner staff capacity-building when possible. Local&#13;
short-term consultants will be needed to assist in areas such as policy formulation, school&#13;
development programs, behavior change communication, and progressive training and teaching&#13;
techniques. Sustainability will depend on the skills in placeâ&#128;&#148;that is, it will depend on effectively&#13;
trained staff. Ability to scale up will depend on the actual number of staff accessedâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
existing staffing structures through which the HWWS activities can occur, taking advantage of&#13;
existing opportunities and minimizing the effort required by staff.&#13;
Availability of Products and Tools: Findings&#13;
The majority of handwashing organizations interviewed felt strongly that handwashing needs to&#13;
be included in clean water programs and that handwashing should not be promoted in areas&#13;
where lack of access has been demonstrated. Equally, they felt that handwashing should&#13;
accompany sanitation projects, thus increasing access threefold: to latrines, to water, and to&#13;
handwashing products and tools. Several studies indicate that soap of some sort is accessible to&#13;
most households; 36 the assessment team also observed some sort of soap in all households&#13;
visited.&#13;
These same studies did not identify any significant constraints to producing HWWS products&#13;
such as soap or handwashing facilities. Private sector agencies interviewed indicated that no&#13;
significant taxes have been imposed. Several NGOs and district-level government agencies&#13;
stated that some programs offer low- to no-interest sanitation facility loans encouraging the&#13;
inclusion of handwashing facilities as part of the construction packageâ&#128;&#148;for example, water&#13;
basin, pipes and drainage pit, built-in soap dish, and so on. They also reported, however, that&#13;
although HWWS facilities are encouraged, they have seldom been included in the construction&#13;
done.&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;The assessment team uncovered limited data on buying power and on willingness to pay.&#13;
Interviews with PSI revealed that the PSI-SafeWat project has reported a 100 percent cost&#13;
recovery in rural areas of water purification at a cost of approximately 15 cents/week. 37 The PSI&#13;
Safe-Wat experience also indicated that people are willing to pay for a health product that has&#13;
not traditionally been used or been a habit.&#13;
Availability of Products and Tools: Conclusions&#13;
There has been insufficient attention given to products and tools. It is unclear what access is&#13;
available, what the buying power is, and what willingness to pay exists. The availability of&#13;
products and tools has been insufficiently audited. Additional examination of existing products&#13;
and tools research and market surveys is required. Because the success of a Vietnam HWWS&#13;
Initiative will also depend on the success of water supply and sanitation programs, Handwashing&#13;
Initiative activities need to be established at the same time in the same areas.&#13;
Financing: Findings&#13;
The allocated budgets of the WSP-supported Handwashing Initiative of about US$3 million and&#13;
the Unilever-supported Handwashing Initiative of US$2.6 million indicate that the trend for&#13;
financing HWWS opportunities and willingness is positive. A 3 percent increase in money&#13;
allocated to hygiene promotion as well as communication and handwashing has been seen over&#13;
the last five years. 38&#13;
Interviews and a document review indicate that there has been insufficient consideration and&#13;
thought given to developing a budget for (1) initial required investment costsâ&#128;&#148;that is, capacity-&#13;
building, market reinforcement, and so on; (2) recurrent costs; and (3) sustainability costs. Most&#13;
government agencies report that capacity-building is seldom included in budgets. The majority&#13;
of NGOs stated that materials for distribution are generally underbudgeted and, as a result,&#13;
underdistributed. Also no organizations or agencies interviewed indicated that they had specific&#13;
budget line items for handwashing activities in their organizational budgets.&#13;
In 2000, GOV endorsed a national RWSS strategy and action plan. 39 Government agencies and&#13;
several NGOs report that this has provided a reasonable framework for large-scale investments.&#13;
Provincial- and district-level government agencies stated that budget decision making is made at&#13;
the national level. Once budgeted, monies are passed to the provincial level for use and&#13;
implementation. They report that because they are not involved in establishing budgets, and still&#13;
expected to fulfill programs based on what budget is given to them, that â&#128;&#156;budgets are not based&#13;
on activities to be carried out, but activities are determined based on how much money is&#13;
received.â&#128;? They felt that this not only compromised their ability to effectively plan and&#13;
implement, but that often it also meant that essential activities could not take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37&#13;
     This is not handwashing, but it does demonstrate the buying power for health-related products.&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Financing: Conclusions&#13;
There is insufficient funding to both sustain and expand. Financing is sufficient for full coverage&#13;
of the eight pilot provinces, but only if expansion to other provinces or an increase in mass media&#13;
and other target audience communication activities is curtailed. Or financing is sufficient to&#13;
establish a foundation for sustainability, but only if provincial expansion and pilot province&#13;
coverage is minimized.&#13;
The lack of deliberate budgetingâ&#128;&#148;that is, clearly identifying investment costs and recurrent&#13;
costsâ&#128;&#148;will hamper budgetary planning for scaling up because one-time investment costs might&#13;
be included repeatedly and unnecessarily, raising the final budget amount for scale up beyond&#13;
what is actually needed and what can actually be raised. Involved handwashing players,&#13;
including the GOV, need to be encouraged to create a handwashing line item in their budgets.&#13;
An increase in funding and/or in-kind investments from numerous funding sources is needed to&#13;
increase the likelihood of sustainability and scalability. This would reduce dependence or control&#13;
of one investor, through proven visibility opportunities and identified social responsibility efforts.&#13;
Cost-Effective Implementation: Findings&#13;
No organization or agency interviewed reported systems or procedures to examine or assess cost-&#13;
effectiveness. They did, however, feel that sufficient expertise to gather and assess data was in&#13;
place. Furthermore, they indicated that if data collection were combined with other supervisory&#13;
visits or monitoring work, sufficient staff exists to carry out this work.&#13;
Cost-Effective Implementation: Conclusions&#13;
A cost-effectiveness study will be included in the WSP-supported Handwashing Initiative impact&#13;
evaluation. No consideration has been given to reducing wastage through combined partnering&#13;
efforts, nor to examining the costs of methods, such as the use of â&#128;&#156;labor-intensiveâ&#128;? interpersonal&#13;
communications versus the use of â&#128;&#156;high-costâ&#128;? television advertisements; this type of&#13;
examination could be an important contribution to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to both sustain and scale up.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E): Findings&#13;
No organizations or agencies interviewed noted that any indicators were in place for&#13;
handwashing rates or for HWWS behavior change assessment. Most interviewed mentioned&#13;
traditional self-report and observation as the methods being considered to gather data.&#13;
Government agencies report that, historically, there has been little or no funding for M&amp;E&#13;
activities at the national level. However, the provincial- and district-level staff report that they&#13;
have developed systems, in conjunction with the Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Committee and the unions, to monitor&#13;
and gather traditional epidemiological data such as number of diarrheal disease cases and so on.&#13;
Also NIHE, a parastatal research agency, reported that it has significant expertise in protocol&#13;
development; program useâ&#128;&#148;that is, Statistical Program for Social Sciences and so on;&#13;
surveillance; and report-writing. However, they also reported that they have limited staff to&#13;
participate in M&amp;E outside of their own work. CERWASS and CWS reported that a Vietnam&#13;
handwashing bulletin is disseminated, albeit irregularly, on handwashing activities, behavior&#13;
change techniques, and study findings through the handwashing working group that has existed&#13;
since 2000, but which is presently â&#128;&#156;unâ&#128;?-chaired and as a result is nonfunctioning.&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;All government agencies, most NGOs, and several private sector agencies interviewed felt that&#13;
because of differing statistics on the rates of HWWS, no agreement could be reached on the&#13;
baseline to use. Most felt that to effectively evaluate the impact of an approach on HWWS rates,&#13;
they needed to agree on baseline figures. As stated by one NGO, â&#128;&#156;how do you double the rate of&#13;
HWWS when you havenâ&#128;&#153;t established an agreed upon starting point?â&#128;?&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E): Conclusions&#13;
There are limited skills and staff to conduct M&amp;E. Capacity needs to be strengthened through&#13;
directed training. Agreement needs to be reached on baseline figures. Core indicators need to be&#13;
developed and training needs to be conducted in recommended data collection methods. The&#13;
Handwashing Initiative needs to examine existing, ongoing M&amp;E activities and explore ways to&#13;
include HWWS, thus making best use of existing resources and staff. Existing epidemiological&#13;
data collection systems need to be investigated and utilized as appropriate. The organization of&#13;
an M&amp;E working group could aid in accomplishing these tasks and in establishing an agreed-&#13;

&amp;#12;7. Plan of Action&#13;
The Plan of Action has been designed so that the program in Vietnam can review and pull those&#13;
actions that it feels are appropriate and insert them into a revised Handwashing Initiative Plan of&#13;
Action. Items are presented in order of priority and each builds on the actions that precede it.&#13;
Overview of Plan of Action&#13;
The Plan provides suggested short-term and medium-term actions only. It provides suggestions&#13;
for the player/partner to take responsibility for the completion of action (â&#128;&#156;Responsible Agentâ&#128;? in&#13;
Table 8). Actions recommended in the Plan will (1) strengthen sustainability efforts of the&#13;
handwashing program required to continue the work, (2) enhance the likelihood of sustainability&#13;
of HWWS practices, and (3) put in place requisite conditions, whether programmatic or&#13;
behavioral, for scalability. The actions have been marked indicating which of the following they&#13;
expected to influence:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   PS â&#128;&#147; programmatic sustainability&#13;
   â&#128;¢   BS â&#128;&#147; behavioral sustainability&#13;
   â&#128;¢   SC â&#128;&#147; scalability&#13;
Budget for Short- and Medium-Term Activities&#13;
Short-term activities are projected for a six-month period, from October 2007 to March 2008.&#13;
Medium-term activities are projected for a nine-month period, from April 2008 to December&#13;
2008. The budget does not include money to carry out any actual project activities. It provides a&#13;
budget for enabling environment strengthening activities only. Budgets for each term are listed&#13;
below. Total estimated budget amount is $474,500: the short-term budget is $185,100; the&#13;
medium-term budget is $289,400.&#13;
Implementation Challenges&#13;
Implementations challenges will include:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   involving all levels and multiple sectors in the decision-making process;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   moving from the perception, in thought and in action, of a handwashing initiative/project&#13;
       to national strategy/program;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   informing multiple audiences at multiple levels of HWWS work, and purpose, and&#13;
       gaining support;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   identifying skilled local consultantsâ&#128;&#148;that is, those who understand the topic and the&#13;
       government system, and have the cooperation, collaboration and coordination skillsâ&#128;&#148;to&#13;
       carry out proposed short-term work; and&#13;
   â&#128;¢   achieving characteristics for sustainability and scalability under the present proposed&#13;
       project targets and within the four-year timeframe designated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Use of Short-Term Consultants&#13;
When it is possible, a partnering organization should supply staff to work on the tasks delineated&#13;
in the Plan of Actionâ&#128;&#148;that is, the Handwashing Initiative should make the best use of its&#13;
resources as it can and as appropriate. When not possible, it is suggested that local short-term&#13;
consultants (STCs) be hired to carry out the selected, targeted activity. If it is necessary to hire a&#13;
STC, it is recommended that local STCs be contracted, using, as a first course, staff from&#13;
Vietnam handwashing organizations and agencies when appropriate and legitimate, for the&#13;
actions clearly noted in the Plan of Action. Partnering handwashing organizations and agencies&#13;
should be called upon to assist in the development and writing of the STC terms of reference as&#13;
available and interested.&#13;

            To follow up country work supported by
            the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW), the
            World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) received
            funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to
            support projects to scale up the promotion of handwashing
            with soap (HWWS) in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam.
            The major project objectives of the Handwashing Initiative
            are: a) inculcate the HWWS habit among millions of mothers
            and children in these countries, b) use a strong monitoring
            and evaluation (M&amp;E) component to enhance the
            conceptualizing and management of such programs, and c)
            establish sustainable programs that will continue and expand
            after this four-year grant ends. Enabling environment
            assessments are being carried out in all four countries to
            assess current conditions for scalability and sustainability
            and to make recommendations for improving conditions that
            are not supportive. This report summarizes the study in
            Vietnam. All four county studies are following a similar
            methodology, developed by WSP, to examine nine dimensions of
            scalability/sustainability through individual and group
            in-depth interviews and an electronic survey in which
            respondents are asked to score various statements.
