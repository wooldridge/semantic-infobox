LOAN AND PROJECr SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC)&#13;
Poverty:          No targeted interventions.  Textbooks will be distributed&#13;
nationwide to all children; poorest children will benefit the most,&#13;
since they currently lack textbooks almost entirely.&#13;
Amount:           US$132.5 million equivalent&#13;
Terns:            Repayable in 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:   The five-year project would aim at improving the quality of basic&#13;
education by addressing critical factors affecting both the supply&#13;
of, and demand for, textbooks. This would be achieved through&#13;
establishing government policies, regulations, procedures, and&#13;
practices related to school books, and making textbooks available&#13;
in classrooms in sufficient quantity and in a sustainable way.&#13;
Specifically, the project would support:  (a) provision of&#13;
textbooks in all required subjects, for all children in primary (SD)&#13;
and junior secondary (SLTP) schools, public and private, giving&#13;
priority attention to poor children; (b) procurement of the SLTP&#13;
textbooks from private publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a&#13;
transparent and rigorous evaluation and approval process, with&#13;
the objective of achieving a high quality in the books; (c) greater&#13;
involvement at the provincial level, through implementing the&#13;
procurement process for SLTP textbooks at the Kanwil level;&#13;
(d) giving help to teachers in how to use the books better in the&#13;
classroom; and (e) the promotion of reading, especially for&#13;
children.&#13;
Benefits:         The ultimate benefit would be increased educational quality and&#13;
improvements in literacy in schools providing basic education.&#13;
The more immediate benefits would be quality enhancement of&#13;
textbooks, the provision of about 157 million textbooks to SD&#13;
students and 85 million to SLTP students, and a better use of&#13;
textbooks in the schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- U -&#13;
Risks:            The project would be exposed to some risks, but those seem&#13;
manageable.  First, within MOEC, current procedures and&#13;
organizational units would be affected by the decentralization and&#13;
privatization proposed under the project. However, most policy&#13;
changes have already been introduced, and others seem fuily in&#13;
line with the statements in the Government's new five-year&#13;
development program.  Second, the project's objective of&#13;
providing good-quality textbooks, with fair competition among&#13;
publishers at the provincial level, is complex and will require&#13;
Kanwil expertise currently not available.  The procurement&#13;
procedures that will be followed for textbook procurement are&#13;
expected to safeguard quality and competition, while also&#13;
providing adequate control of the process at the Kanwil level.&#13;

1. BOOK AND READING ACTIWITIES IN INDONESIA&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Since Independence, Indonesia has carried out an intensive and active program of&#13;
education improvement, particularly in expanding primary education.  With the&#13;
introduction of a special, additional presidential budget for primary education (INPRES&#13;
SD) in 1973, the increasing number of primary schools and rising enrollments throughout&#13;
the country have resulted in virtual universal primary education (see Annex 1). Today,&#13;
about 27.4 million children are enrolled in about 137,000 public primary schools (Sekolah&#13;
Dasar or SD), and a further 1.9 million children in about 10,000 private primary schools.&#13;
The latter are government-supported, but managed privately, mainly by religious groups.&#13;
A typical SD school consists of six classrooms, one for each grade, but increasingly,&#13;
additional three-room blocks are being added for multi-purpose activities (e.g., principal's&#13;
office, teachers' room, library, sick room). Each school has an allotment of at least nine&#13;
teachers: a principal, six classroom teachers, and sports and religion teachers. Other&#13;
models exist, especially in the remote areas, where multigrade schools are more common.&#13;
1.2    With universal primary education virtually achieved, the Government has now&#13;
embarked on the accelerated expansion of enrollment for junior secondary schools&#13;
(SLTP). The Government intends to extend, over the next 15 years, basic education to&#13;
nine years. This entails a renewed program of building of schools and training of teachers&#13;
to bring the total SLTP enrollment from about 6 million children at 20,000 schools now,&#13;
to a total of about 13 million children by the year 2009. SLTP schools consist of three&#13;
grades (grade 1 through 3), and typically will have 6 to 9 classrooms. Twelve subjects are&#13;
taught by subject teachers.&#13;
1.3    The Government also intends to address quality throughout the education system.&#13;
At the primary level, its fast expansion did result in quality trade-offs. Making sure that&#13;
there were enough classrooms and teachers for all children has meant that not all buildings&#13;
and teachers were of good quality. In addition, there has always been a shortage of&#13;
educational materials. Budgets have been chronically inadequate. In recent years,&#13;
Indonesia spent about 9.1 percent of its government budget for education purposes, of&#13;
which about half for primary education. This compares with about 16 percent in Korea&#13;
and the Philippines and about 20 percent in Singapore and Thailand (see Annex 2). Also,&#13;
most of the primary education budget (about 85 percent) is used for teacher salaries.&#13;
B. MAJORIssuEs&#13;
1.4    Quality Problems The shortage of resources has had an impact on the quality&#13;
of education, which is still being felt today. Although there is a high initial enrollment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
there is also a retention problem: only 68 percent of primary school students complete six&#13;
years in school, with wide variations from province to province (87 percent in Bali vs.&#13;
48 percent in West Kalimantan). Furthermore, transition rates to junior secondary schools&#13;
are about 56 percent, and have been declining in the last few years. There is also evidence&#13;
that children learn less in school than could be expected. Recent school assessment work&#13;
in mathematics in Grades 5 and 6, carried out by Bank staff,' shows that tests on&#13;
knowledge of material from the Grade 3 and 4 curriculum were variable, but low in many&#13;
schools (for applied number problems, mean school scores ranged from 7 percent to&#13;
68 percent).&#13;
1.5    To correct these quality problems, improvements are now being carried out in a&#13;
number of areas. A program has been started for upgrading pre-service primary teacher&#13;
training, as well as strengthening in-service training. A program for improving secondary&#13;
teacher training is also being prepared. Teacher salaries are being increased, and specia&#13;
premiums are given to teachers who are being sent to teach in remote areas. Many&#13;
primary schools are receiving additional classrooms, which can be used for a variety of&#13;
purposes, and additional junior secondary schools are being constructed. For those areas&#13;
where the basic school model is not appropriate, the Government is adjusting the model&#13;
(e.g., multi-grade schools with fewer classrooms and teachers in low-population density&#13;
areas). In addition, the INPRES SD progran, which started out primarily for school&#13;
building purposes, is now increasingly being used for school maintenance and to purchase&#13;
textbooks and supplementary reading and reference books for primary schools.&#13;
1.6    Reading Achievement. The achievement of reading and literacy is one of the&#13;
main objectives to be accomplished during primary education. However, reading levels in&#13;
the country are generally still very low, largely because of the lack of a receptive reading&#13;
environment and reading culture. Indonesia traditionally does not have a strong reading&#13;
culture, and emphasis has normally been placed on oral traditions, story telling, and visual&#13;
drama. In addition, Bahasa Indonesia-the language of instruction-is not spoken as a&#13;
first language by the majority of the population (only 15 percent of the population speak&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia as their first language). The size and the diversity of the country, with&#13;
large differences among regions and groups, make changes in reading behavior and the&#13;
introduction of intervention programs slow and difficult.&#13;
1.7    Textbooks. Despite an official policy of free textbooks for all students, the&#13;
availability of books to students-both in the school and at home-is very limited.&#13;
Textbooks are published officially by the Government; several private publishers also&#13;
publish textbooks, which are used in many schools. In recent years, the Government has&#13;
been distributing free textbooks at a ratio of about one book per four students. Each year,&#13;
some provinces are targeted, and then receive a much higher number of textbooks.&#13;
During FY94/95, new curriculum books were provided for Grades 2 and 5 in SD schools&#13;
and for SLTP Grade 2 in a 1:4 ratio. During FY95/96, books will be provided to all&#13;
schools in poor villages (Desa Tertinggal, DT) schools in a 1:1 ratio. The distribution&#13;

within the provinces is handled by the provincial and district offices (Kanwil and Kandep)&#13;
of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) with uneven results. Usually, the&#13;
farther the schools are from the provincial capitals, the fewer books they receive.&#13;
Warehouses have been built in all provinces to store the books, but their use is sporadic&#13;
and not well managed.&#13;
1.8    Since there is such a shortage of government-produced textbooks, several private&#13;
publishers have established large and thriving textbook publishing businesses. There are&#13;
about 12 such textbook publishers, who, together, cover most of the country. Private&#13;
publishers work largely through a sales force, outside of the bookstores, that market&#13;
books to school principals and teachers. As a result, there are many more private,&#13;
unofficial textbooks available in the schools than there are government textbooks.&#13;
Quality-wise, some of the privately published textbooks are better than the government-&#13;
produced books (better and more interesting treatment of the material, as well as better&#13;
physical quality), and others are worse. In schools in more well-to-do areas, up to&#13;
70 percent of the children in the classroom may have their own textbooks, while in poorer&#13;
areas none, or maybe only one or two, have a textbook.&#13;
1.9    Reading Books. To foster reading skills and behavior, reading and reference&#13;
books play an important role, and are essential in broadening the vocabulary, creating the&#13;
motivation to read, and providing information beyond the basics from textbooks.&#13;
Establishing the habit to read should be done early in life, at the primary school level.&#13;
Unfortunately, despite increasing book purchases by the Government, there is still a great&#13;
shortage of accessible and interesting books. Separate rooms used as school libraries now&#13;
exist in most secondary schools and in some primary schools, and there are book&#13;
collections for general reading in virtually all schools. The books in most of these&#13;
collections are old, poorly maintained, and of little interest; in many schools, large&#13;
numbers of old textbooks are used as reading collections.&#13;
1.10   Publishing and Book Trade. Estimates of total book sales (excluding imports)&#13;
are about 40 million books in 1991, with gross sales amounting to the equivalent of about&#13;
US$55 million per year. This includes both textbooks and general books, and is less than&#13;
US$1 per person, and about one book for every four to five people in the country, quite&#13;
low by international standards (see Annex 5).  Textbooks and other schoolbooks&#13;
constitute about 70 percent of total book sales. With the exception of schoolbooks, the&#13;
Government imposes very few regulations on publishers, printers, and booksellers.&#13;
Business permits are easy to obtain, and there are no special restrictions on foreign&#13;
investment in publishing and printing. As a result, barriers to entry for publishing and&#13;
printing are low, and there are many players at every level, contributing to a competitive&#13;
environment, and a book industry continuing to grow in size, technical competence, and&#13;
sophistication. Controls and regulations on schoolbooks exist. Textbooks from private&#13;
publishers for use as supplementary books in the schools must go through an elaborate&#13;
approval mechanism that is highly centralized. Selection of reading books for use in&#13;
schools is done in Jakarta, resulting in a select list of titles that are then distributed to all&#13;
schools throughout the country. Although criteria for the selection processes have been&#13;
established, actual book selection has not always been based on best quality.&#13;

1.11   Distribution and Access Problems. One of the main difficulties in making&#13;
books available in Indonesia is the extreme geographic dispersion and the need to provide&#13;
access across wide areas, many of which are difficult to reach. This has affected&#13;
Government distribution of textbooks, which therefore have required specific distribution&#13;
budgets at the local levels to allow for distribution to the school level. Particularly for&#13;
Maluku and Irian Jaya provinces, the scale and magnitude of the distribution difficulties&#13;
will require specific targeted action to resolve. It is also a problem for the private sector,&#13;
which has to make a sufficient number of retail outlets available, which carry a large&#13;
enough selection of books to be appealing to the local clientele. So far, retail outlets for&#13;
books are largely concentrated in the cities and towns. Although the book industry is&#13;
showing signs of initiative everywhere in finding alternative ways of bringing their books&#13;
to the customers, there is still considerable scope for improvement. In recent years, the&#13;
Government has contributed to building up the local book trade by decentralizing printing&#13;
of its textbooks to printers at the provincial level and by requiring public libraries to buy&#13;
for their collections from local bookshops.&#13;
1.12   Textbook Financing. Based on current Govenmment budgets and textbook&#13;
purchases by parents from private publishers, an average of about 30 million textbooks&#13;
annually have been produced and purchased in recent years.  Total government&#13;
expenditures for primary education are currently approximately US$70 per student per&#13;
year.2 In addition, average parental expenditures are estimated at roughly US$35 per&#13;
student (in student fees, uniforms and textbooks), although, obviously, there are wide&#13;
differences in how much parents spend depending on income and their capacity to pay. Of&#13;
the annual Government of Indonesia (GOI) primary school budget of Rp 3,000 billion,&#13;
about Rp 75 billion (approximately US$1.20 per student per year) has been allocated for&#13;
textbooks for FY94/95 and for FY95/96. In addition, parents spend an estimated Rp 90&#13;
billion per year on textbooks for all grade levels and school types, based on estimated sales&#13;
figures of books sold currently by private publishers. To give all children in SD and SLTP&#13;
(Grades 1-9) textbooks in all subjects would cost an estimated Rp 710 billion (Rp 400&#13;
billion for SD and Rp 310 billion for SLTP) during Repelita VI. The Government is&#13;
planning to provide the necessary textbooks to cover all subjects, including teachers'&#13;
guides. The GOI budget allowance for textbooks for the next five years would cover the&#13;
provision of textbooks for SD, while Bank loan funds would be used to cover SLTP&#13;
books.&#13;

C. CuRRENT GovERNmENT ORGANATION, POLICIES, AND REGuLATIONS&#13;
1.13  Government Organization.  Several government agencies are involved in&#13;
furthering book distribution and reading in the country:&#13;
(a)   The National Book Development Council was established by Presidential&#13;
Decree No. 5 of 1978 to help the Government in preparing book-related&#13;
policies. It is responsible to the Minister of Education and Culture, with a&#13;
membership covering the full range of government and private interests,&#13;
including representatives of publishers, printers, distributors, writers, and&#13;
translators. Over the past 16 years, it has made a host of recommendations&#13;
for solving book-related problems, prepared drafts of laws and regulations,&#13;
carried out research and studies, and cooperated with international&#13;
agencies on seminars and training. This has contributed to the country's&#13;
increased recognition of the importance of books as an essential input for&#13;
the development process.&#13;
(b)   The Book Center acts as the Secretariat of the Council (with the Book&#13;
Center Director as the Secretary), and was established by Presidential&#13;
Decree No. 4 of 1978, and elaborated on in Ministerial Decree No.&#13;
0274/0/1987. It is an executive agency, reporting directly to the Minister&#13;
of Education and Culture. It fails administratively under the Secretary&#13;
General, and takes technical guidance from relevant Directorates-General&#13;
of MOEC. It is responsible for book matters in MOEC, both textbooks&#13;
and reading books, but has been mostly concerned with the production and&#13;
distribution of textbooks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
(c)   The Baku Pustaka, a state-owned enterprise, is the printing house of&#13;
MOEC. It reprints, among others, the books produced by the Book Center&#13;
and, in addition publishes its own textbooks and other books. It is&#13;
estimated that Balai Pustaka covers approximately 5-7 percent of core-&#13;
subject textbook needs.&#13;
1.14 School Book Evaluation. All books received or purchased by the schools need&#13;
the endorsement of the Directorate-General of Primary and Secondary Education of&#13;
MOEC. Books produced by the Book Center are not evaluated, but all privately&#13;
published textbooks, reading books, and reference books for school use have to pass an&#13;
evaluation process, managed by the Directorate of Education Facilities of the Directorate-&#13;
General, to be put on the "list of school books published by private publishers which have&#13;
been legalized". Books are evaluated on the basis of (a) contents, (b) national security,&#13;
(c) language, and (d) graphics, and the list of approved books is then circulated to the&#13;
regions. However, the evaluation process is cumbersome, time-consuming, and not&#13;
always the best books are selected.&#13;
1.15   Reading Book Evaluation and Distribution. Reading books (buku bacaan) are&#13;
intended for school libraries, and can be assigned by teachers to students as extra reading.&#13;
Since 1973, part of the INPRES SD (special budget, targeted for primary schools) budget&#13;
(recently about Rp 37 billion) has been used for the purchase of reading and reference&#13;
books in primary schools. Each year, depending on the budget, a list of titles is selected&#13;
by central government officials, managed by the Directorate of Education Facilities. The&#13;
number of titles has been as high as 120 (in 1992), but is usually less. In principle, one&#13;
copy of each selected title is sent to each primary school in the country. In practice,&#13;
however, far fewer copies are printed and distributed. Also, the same distribution&#13;
problems that plague the Book Center's textbooks are evident with these INPRES SD&#13;
books. As a result of the selection and distribution problems, much of the substantial&#13;
investment in reading books is wasted. Recently, the reading book selection process has&#13;
been much improved; in addition to the existing evaluation and selection procedures,&#13;
proposed reading books are read by children in three provinces, whose evaluation also&#13;
contributes to the overall score.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. PREVIOUS INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1    Since the early 1970s, the Government has undertaken an ambitious program of&#13;
formal and non-formal education and training development. The Bank Group has&#13;
supported 31 education and training projects (US$1,860 million total) in the sector, of&#13;
which 20 projects (USS1,263 million total) were or are implemented through MOEC (see&#13;
Annex 4).&#13;
2.2    The Bank supported two textbook development projects in Indonesia from 1973&#13;
to 1988 [Third Education Project (Cr. 387-IND) and Second Textbook Project (Ln. 2102-&#13;
IND)]. Both projects had as their central objective to improve the availability and quality&#13;
of textbooks. The Third Education Project-the first Bank operation anywhere to deal&#13;
with the problem of inadequate and inappropriate textbooks-produced about 300 million&#13;
textbooks and teacher guides, while its successor produced an additional 150 million.&#13;
While this represented a great improvement over the previous, textbook-starved era, the&#13;
projects produced textbooks whose physical quality and content was less than adequate.&#13;
In addition, the lack of storage facilities along the distribution chain meant losses and wear&#13;
and tear even before the books reached the classrooms. The Book Center, with a network&#13;
of almost 300 warehouses and depots to assist in the large-scale distribution of textbooks&#13;
from one central agency, was created to address these problems.&#13;
2.3    The Bank is also supporting several ongoing and proposed projects aimed at&#13;
quality improvement at the basic education level. The Primary Education Quality&#13;
Improvement Project (Ln. 3448-IND) provides a package of quality improvements in&#13;
schools in six pilot provinces; it aims to improve the local management of primary schools;&#13;
supports in-service training for principals, teachers, and tutors; and fosters a better school&#13;
environment through greater community participation, educational materials, and teacher&#13;
motivation. Simultaneously, the Primary School Teacher Development Project (Ln. 3496-&#13;
IND) focuses on pre-service training of teachers and a better system of teacher supply,&#13;
allocation, and distribution.  In addition, the Second Secondary Education and&#13;
Management Project (Ln. 3158-IND), as well as future planned Secondary Education&#13;
Development Projects, address requirements and weaknesses at the secondary level.&#13;
These projects combined represent an extensive and intensive approach on the part of the&#13;
Government and the Bank to deal with the quality weaknesses that are currently evident in&#13;
basic education.&#13;
2.4    The Government now plans to specifically address the availability and use of&#13;
textbooks in basic education schools, as one of the major educational inputs into&#13;
education. In the delivery of a quality basic education system, textbooks are essential.&#13;
Creating a better workforce and improving the quality of basic education means not only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  -&#13;
improving the teachers, but providing them also with the necessary tools to carry out&#13;
teaching. Putting books in the schools is one of the most cost-effective ways of improving&#13;
education quality.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.5    Much experience has been gained from earlier Bank-assisted projects and sector&#13;
work in basic education in general and textbook development in particular. The proposed&#13;
project reflects the lessons learned from the Project Performance Audit Report Ion the&#13;
previous two textbook projects (both with a satisfactory rating), the Bank's "Indonesia -&#13;
Basic Education Study"' and recent informal sector work carried out by Bank staff in&#13;
Indonesia. It also reflects Bank experience with education and textbook projects&#13;
elsewhere in the world, as well as with current research on the importance of reading. The&#13;
main lessons are:&#13;
(a)   Financing of Textbooks. The Government must ensure that children in all&#13;
schools in the country have textbooks available to them. A comparison&#13;
with recent activities in textbook provision in other developing countries is&#13;
useful. Annex 3 provides an overview of recent World Bank-assisted&#13;
projects for textbook support in nine countries. As can be seen from the&#13;
table, a range of activities and policies is evident. While some countries&#13;
provide free textbooks for all (Brazil in some provinces, Chile, Romania&#13;
and the Philippines), others target textbooks to poor areas or students, with&#13;
cost-recovery from richer parents in some cases (China, and Venezuela).&#13;
In India (Province of Uttar Pradesh), textbook costs have been kept vezy&#13;
low and all parents are expected to purchase for their children. In all these&#13;
cases, however, the objective is and has been to ensure that adequate&#13;
numbers of textbooks are available in the schools, and that a continuing&#13;
supply is possible on a sustainable basis.&#13;
(b)   Textbook Procurement and Distribution.  Bank experience with&#13;
textbook projects throughout the world shows that there are frequent&#13;
problems with  the currently used methods of procurement.  Most&#13;
importantly, the distribution mechanisms down to the school level are&#13;
frequently deficient or not enough taken into account in the procurement&#13;
process. Unless distribution down to the school is made an integral part of&#13;
the procurement contract, books often remain in warehouses and are not&#13;
received in the schools. In the project, distribution to the school level will&#13;
be given close attention, and will be carried out as a part of the&#13;
procurement contract.&#13;
3  OED Report No. 10678, Apri 15, 1992.&#13;
4  Report No. 7841-IND, Deember 22, 1989.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
(c)   Policy and Regulatory Environment.  The policy and regulatory&#13;
environment can be an important restricting influence on the production&#13;
and distribution of books. In Indonesia, the regulatory laissez-faire for&#13;
general books is matched with a restrictive framework for school books.&#13;
There are large time lags in getting school books approved, and these drive&#13;
up publishers' costs unnecessarily. In addition, the annual large-scale&#13;
government purchasing of reading books under the Inpres SD budget has a&#13;
distorting effect on the book industry. Therefore, a major emphasis on&#13;
increasing the production and improving the quality of books-both&#13;
textbooks and general reading books for school use-should be&#13;
accompanied by streamlined procedures, allowing for fair and equitable&#13;
competition.&#13;
(d)   Relative Roles of Government and Private Sector. During the past 20&#13;
years, the Government has played a major role in the provision of&#13;
textbooks, and the establishment of the Book Center institutionalized the&#13;
Government's position. Nevertheless, budgetary support has been limited,&#13;
especially after the closing of the two Bank-supported projects. As a&#13;
result, the private sector has tried to fill the gap, and now produces&#13;
80 percent of all textbooks in the country. There is a need to clarify this&#13;
relationship between the Government and private publishers, and to&#13;
establish what each partner will be responsible for. It seems that the Book&#13;
Center should shift from textbook production to becoming a policy and&#13;
quality control body while production and distribution should be largely&#13;
handled by the private sector. It is also expected that the Book Center will&#13;
support textbook evaluation for use in schools. Greater attention on the&#13;
part of Government to its role in quality control should result in better-&#13;
quality books being introduced in the schools.&#13;
C. BANK STRATEGY&#13;
2.6   The Bank's Basic Education Study5 concluded that the quality of education in most&#13;
of the country's primary and secondary schools was deficient, and this is basically still the&#13;
case. The study recommended that more resources should be given to schools, especially&#13;
to schools where parents are unable to contribute. Improvements in teacher competence&#13;
and streamlining of the budget process were also identified as needing attention. Based on&#13;
this study, and on the Government's priorities as laid down in its five-year development&#13;
plans, recent Bank strategy in basic education has been to address quality improvements&#13;
through a multi-pronged approach, of which this project would be a critical element.&#13;
Quality issues are being addressed in the following areas: pre-service teacher training, in-&#13;
service teacher training, budgetary management, budgetary support targeted to poor areas&#13;
(underserved schools), and the provision of educational materials.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.7   The Book and Reading Development Project supports the Bank's 1995 CAS for&#13;
Indonesia, which was presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS places&#13;
emphasis on the importance of quality in education, especially of basic education. Poor&#13;
children will be ensured of having the necessary educational materials they cannot afford.&#13;
The Project also supports regional development, by placing textbook purchasing decsion-&#13;
making in the hands of the provinces. The Bank's comparative advantage in textbook&#13;
provision lies in its systematic overview and support of basic education, its&#13;
complementarity with ongoing and future projects in primary and secondary education-&#13;
including previous textbook projects-and its global expertise with textbook production&#13;
and distribution.&#13;
2.8    The main goals of basic education are to develop, at the primary level, basic&#13;
numeracy and literacy skills, as well as the ability to apply basic skills to new problems.&#13;
Children who have gone to school for six years should have basic literacy; be able to&#13;
transfer their knowledge to related problem solving; and know basic arithmetic operations.&#13;
If these goals are not accomplished during the primary education process, it compromises&#13;
the entire education system, and produces students who are poorly prepared for secondary&#13;
and tertiary level education. The acquisition of literacy requires children who not only can&#13;
read-become literate-but will read-develop a reading habit. Instructional materials&#13;
are key elements in this process. They are also the main instruments used by teachers in&#13;
delivering the curriculum. Good textbooks help students to learn, in addition to the time&#13;
spent in the classroom. It is, therefore, essential that sufficient textbooks of good quality&#13;
are available in all classrooms. In addition, and equally important, children should have&#13;
access to reading and general reference books, including dictionaries and atlases. At the&#13;
secondary school level, textbooks are equally important, to deliver a more complex&#13;
curriculum, and with subject matter that may require repeated coverage and individual&#13;
study by the students.&#13;
2.9    A  recent comprehensive coverage of this subject in "Improving Primary&#13;
Education in Developing Countries" by Lockheed and Verspoor, states explicitly that,&#13;
because textbooks typically deliver the curriculum, they are regarded as the single most&#13;
important instructional material. Nothing has ever replaced the printed word as the key&#13;
element in the educational process and, as a result, textbooks are central to schooling at all&#13;
levels. Sufficient availability of textbooks can ensure that instructional time is not wasted.&#13;
Without them, teachers and students copy text on and off blackboards. Over the past&#13;
decade, researchers have documented the consistently positive effect of availability of&#13;
textbooks and other instructional materials on student achievement in developing&#13;
countries. For example, in Nicaragua students in classes randomly assigned to receive&#13;
textbooks scored significantly higher, by about one-third of a standard deviation, on a test&#13;
of mathematics achievement than students in classes with no supplementary materials. In&#13;
the Philippines, first and second grade children were supplied with textbooks under two&#13;
different conditions: a student to textbook ratio of 2:1 and a student to textbook ratio of&#13;
1:1. A comparison group was drawn from students in school the previous year when the&#13;
ratio of students to textbooks was 10:1. The effect of having textbooks was substantial,&#13;
with students in both textbook conditions scoring about one-third of a standard deviation&#13;
higher on tests of science, mathematics and Filipino than the comparison group. In Brazil,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
the effects on student learning of adding various "school quality" elements to poor rural&#13;
schools were studied over a five-year period 1981-1985; one element was textbooks.&#13;
Second and fourth grade students in schools receiving textbooks scored significantly&#13;
higher on tests of mathematics and Portuguese than students in schools lackig textbooks.&#13;
More recent research in Northeast Brazil confirms the crucial imporance of textbooks for&#13;
education performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PRoJEcT OBJEcTIvEs&#13;
3.1    The project aims to improve the quality of education for primary (SD) and junior&#13;
secondary (SLTP) school children (9-year compulsory education). In particular, the&#13;
project would be expected to contribute to improving the production and distribution of&#13;
more and better quality textbooks, their availability in the classrooms, and their use by&#13;
teachers in the curriculum. These supply and demand objectives would be achieved by&#13;
assisting in the implementation of a textbook provision and distribution system to all&#13;
elementary and junior secondary school children on a sustainable basis; giving help to&#13;
teachers in how to use the books better in the classroom; and motivate and promote&#13;
reading habits among children. The efforts would be fully in line with the Government's&#13;
inter-sectoral objectives of decentralization and privatization.  They also support&#13;
Government's intentions in Repelita VI (1994 to 1999), to improve the quality of basic&#13;
education.&#13;
3.2   The project will accomplish the implementation of three policy changes, all of&#13;
which have been agreed by the Government:&#13;
(a)   complete coverage of textbooks to all children in basic education;&#13;
(b)   competitive procurement of junior secondary textbooks from private&#13;
sector publishers and Balai Pustaka; and&#13;
(c)   decentralization of junior secondary textbook purchasing decisions to the&#13;
provincial level.&#13;
B. PRoJECr COMPONENTS AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   The project would consist of the following components:&#13;
(a)   support the production, distribution and use of more and better textbooks&#13;
through:&#13;
(i)   provision of textbooks in all required subjects, for all children in SD&#13;
(primary schools, public and private), giving priority attention to&#13;
poor children;&#13;
* during the project period, SD textbooks will be provided by&#13;
GOI, with its own funding, and its own procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(ii)    provision of textbooks in all required subjects for all children in&#13;
SLTP (unior secondary schools, public and private);&#13;
* procurement of the SLTP textbooks will be from private&#13;
publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a transparent evaluation&#13;
and approval process, with the objective of achieving a high&#13;
quality in the books;&#13;
* greater involvement at the provincial level will be ensured&#13;
through implementing the procurement procedures at the&#13;
Kanwil level.&#13;
(iii)    giving help to teachers in how to use the textbooks better in the&#13;
classroom.&#13;
(b)    support and increase reading habits, through the promotion of reading,&#13;
especially for children.&#13;
3.4   Improving Textbook Availability and Quality (Total estimated cost US$331.2&#13;
million, including contingencies). This component would assist in the production and&#13;
distribution of more and better-quality textbooks to primary and junior secondary schools&#13;
nationwide.&#13;
(a)   Improving Textbook Availability.  The Textbook Component will&#13;
provide textbooks to all children in SD and SLTP schools. For SD,&#13;
student textbooks and teacher guides will be provided in all subjects (as&#13;
required) for all grades. For SLTP, student textbooks and teacher guides&#13;
will be provided for nine subjects, with teacher guides only for the&#13;
remaining three subjects.6 Textbooks are expected to last for four years,&#13;
and would be replaced every four years. The budgetary issues related to&#13;
SD books are considerably more complex and difficult to solve than those&#13;
for SLTP books. For that reason, GOI will handle the implementation of&#13;
the SD books with its own funding, its own schedule and its own&#13;
arrangements. GOI will develop its own implementation plan, taking into&#13;
account the interdepartmental issues that need to be resolved first. The&#13;
implementation plan for SLTP textbook distribution, starting with fiscal&#13;
year 1996/1997, and until FY 1999/2000 is shown in Annex 6. Books will&#13;
be provided to all schools, with implementation on a subject basis, covering&#13;
all provinces by FY 1999/2000. GOI will gradually increase its textbook&#13;
budget over the next five years, to become fully sustainable by FY 2000.&#13;
During the project period, most of the SLTP textbook requirements will be&#13;
6   For SD, student textooks are for Pancasila, Mathematics, Bahasa Indonesia (grades 1 and 2), and in&#13;
addition Science, and Social Science (for grades 3 through 6); teacher guides for these plus for Arts&#13;
and Crafts, Local Content, and Sports and Health. For SLTP, student textbooks are for Bahasa&#13;
Indonesia, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, World and National History, Economics, Geography, and&#13;
English; teacher guides for these plus Arts and Crafts, Local Content, and Sports and Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
provided through Bank loan funds. The GOI textbook budget will be used&#13;
to cover the remainder of the SLTP textbooks and the entire requirement&#13;
of SD textbooks.&#13;
SLTP textbooks will be procured at the provincial level, based on a&#13;
modified international competitive bidding process, and based on the list of&#13;
approved textbooks. A procurement committee will be established in each&#13;
Kanwil, and will be provided with the necessary technical assistance by&#13;
November 30, 1995; assurances to that effect were obtained during&#13;
negotiations [see para. 6.1(e)]. Each Kanwil will select at least three titles&#13;
for each subject and grade, for which it would like to receive bids. To&#13;
ensure that books are received in the schools, contracts must include the&#13;
distribution provisions, down to the school level. Interested companies will&#13;
be asked to propose bids for publishing and distribution. In each province,&#13;
only one title for each subject and grade will be selected for distribution to&#13;
all schools. An independent review panel in MOEC will review all&#13;
selections, before contract awards are made. Model bidding documents&#13;
were submitted to the Bank during negotiations for review. A detailed&#13;
explanation of the procedures is in Annex 7.&#13;
(b)   Improving Textbook Quality.   A  National Textbook Evaluation&#13;
Committee (NTEC) will be established in MOEC, to evaluate SLTP&#13;
textbooks submitted by private publishers and Balai Pustaka to be included&#13;
for use in the schools. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
Committee would be established by October 1, 1995 [see para. 6.1(a)].&#13;
The Committee would ensure that only SLTP textbooks of a sufficiently&#13;
high quality will be purchased, following detailed and transparent&#13;
evaluation criteria. SLTP textbooks will be evaluated, based on camera-&#13;
ready copy and physical specifications, or on the printed book, submitted&#13;
by private publishers, and can be resubmitted after improvements and&#13;
adjustments are made. The project would provide technical assistance to&#13;
support the working of the Committee.&#13;
(c)   Book Center Role. During the project, the Book Center will adjust to&#13;
emphasize additional functions as a service center catering to the needs of&#13;
both the public and private sectors. Specifically, the Book Center would&#13;
function as the government body responsible for setting and maintaining&#13;
quality control standards for the educational publishing industry and for&#13;
assisting as the Secretariat of the National Book Development Council; the&#13;
Book Center would also support the National Textbook Evaluation&#13;
Committee for SLTP textbooks. At the same time, the Book Center would&#13;
phase out its involvement in physical production, except for some subjects&#13;
for which there is limited demand. The production of textbooks for all&#13;
other subjects and all distribution activities would be left to the private&#13;
sector or to Balai Pustaka. Technical assistance and training, including&#13;
comparative study overseas, would be provided during the project, to assist&#13;

the Book Center in this transition. A detailed explanation of the proposed&#13;
Book Center functions is in Annex 8.&#13;
The project would assist the Center in acquiring the necessary skills, mainly&#13;
through individual training and development programs. Training would&#13;
consist of local and some overseas training. A detailed study program for&#13;
the first year of project implementation was prepared and agreed at&#13;
negotiations. To achieve the Book Center's role vis-a-vis the private&#13;
sector, the project would also provide for workshops for writers, editors,&#13;
translators, printers, and distributors, as well as for the publication of a&#13;
Directory of Indonesian Publishing and a Book Trade Newsletter.&#13;
3.5   Reading  Promotion  (Total estimated  cost US$6.2  million, including&#13;
contingencies). This component would help to stimulate the demand for reading,&#13;
especially by children both in and outside school, through a series of activities, addressing&#13;
the quality of children's books and a reading promotion. Workshops and training on the&#13;
different aspects of children's book writing and publishing will be carried out in all&#13;
provinces, and will be targeted to interested teachers and small publishers. A guidebook&#13;
for schools and teachers, giving suggestions and guidance on how to promote reading in&#13;
children will be produced and distributed. Reading promotional materials, such as radio&#13;
and TV programs, with reading promotion messages, to be broadcast on the educational&#13;
channels will also be prepared.&#13;
3.6   Teacher  Education  (Total estimated  cost US$1.4  million, including&#13;
contingencies). To assist teachers in making better and more intensive use of textbooks,&#13;
and to assist teachers to understand better how to teach reading, the project would assist&#13;
teachers with in-service programs. A series of video and radio programs, would be&#13;
developed, showing model lessons and examples of how textbooks and reference materials&#13;
can be used in the classroom. These programs would be broadcast over the educational&#13;
channels, as well as being made available on cassette.&#13;
3.7   Monitoring and Evaluation  (Total estimated cost US$1.5 million, including&#13;
contingencies). Monitoring will focus on providing timely and accurate information on&#13;
actual receipt of books in the schools and on their use. Terms of reference of monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities will be prepared by October 1, 1995 as agreed during&#13;
negotiations [para. 6.1(b)].  Annex 14 provides information of the objectives and&#13;
monitoring activities that will be carried out. Monitoring will be accomplished through&#13;
ongoing self-reporting from the schools and through on-site visits of randomly selected&#13;
schools each year. The on-site visits will be contracted out and carried out independently.&#13;
The project will also support two in-depth studies (one for SD and one for SLTP and&#13;
based on classroom observations), to assess long-term effects of improving learning in&#13;
basic education.&#13;
3.8   Technical Assistance. The project would require a limited amount of technical&#13;
assistance, both international and domestic, to help manage the project, provide&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, strengthen the Book Center and to provide assistance in&#13;

C. Nwzcr MANAGEmEN AND hLEMENTATON&#13;
3.9    The project would be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU), reporting&#13;
to the Director General for Primary and Secondary Education (DGPSE), and be subject to&#13;
advice from the National Book Development Council. Implementation would be located&#13;
in Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in the Kanwil of Education and Culture in all&#13;
provinces and in the Book Center. These project implementation units would form an&#13;
integral part of the existing organization, using, to the extent possible, staff already in&#13;
place in the units. Assurances were obtained at negotiations of the establishment of the&#13;
PMU and of the Book Center PIU by October 1, 1995 [see para. 6.1(c)] and of the&#13;
Kanwil PIUs by November 30, 1995 [see para. 6.1(d)].&#13;
3.10   The PMU would be headed by a Project Director who would: (a) monitor and&#13;
coordinate procurement and disbursement of the loan, (b) prepare estimates of necessary&#13;
government counterpart fiunding, (c) submit withdrawal applications to the Bank,&#13;
(d) provide semi-annual progress reports to the DGPSE and the Bank, as well as copies&#13;
for the heads of the implementng agencies and departments, (e) arrange for timely audits&#13;
of project accounts, (f) participate in the management of the monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
(g) prepare the implementation completion report, and (h) raise any issues of interest to&#13;
MOEC management and/or the Bank. The Director would be assisted, on a fill-time&#13;
basis, by a project management staff in Jakarta, and by designated staff in all Kanwil&#13;
offices. The PMU will also coordinate in implementation with representatives from the&#13;
Ministry of Religious Affairs. It was agreed at negotiations that the Project Director&#13;
would be appointed not later than August 17, 1995. See also Annex 11 for PMU&#13;
organization. The Project Director and PMU specialists will be recruited locally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
3.11   Implementation Scbedule. The project would be implemented over a period of&#13;
four-and-a-half years, starting October 1, 1995 and ending April 1, 2000. Project&#13;
activities would initially focus (during the first six months) on training Book Center and&#13;
Kanwil staf advising the private sector on the new procedures, ensuring that the Kanwils&#13;
are equipped to handle textbook procurement, and preparing the teacher education&#13;
program. Full implementation (including procurement activities in Kanwils) is expected to&#13;
start at the beginning of FY1996/97.&#13;
3.12   A project activities and implementation schedule for SLTP textbook procurement&#13;
and the Book Center (see Annex 10) and detailed project cost estimates (see Annex 12)&#13;
will serve as the basis for project implementation, and will be updated annually by the&#13;
PMU in cooperation with Bank staff The closing date of the project will be October 1,&#13;
2000.&#13;
3.13  Environment. The environmental impact of the project is expected to be neutral&#13;
(Class C). There are no civil works under the project.&#13;
3.14 Impact on Women. Although there is substantial equality between men and&#13;
women in Indonesia, there are remaining cultural hurdles. This is also reflected in gender&#13;
stereotyping in school books, and the project would aim to correct this by including&#13;
workshops focusing on gender issues and treatment, in the series of workshops for writers&#13;
and editors.&#13;
3.15 Progress Reports and Reviews. The PMU will prepare semi-annual progress&#13;
reports, and submit them to the Bank by April 30 and October 31 of each project year.&#13;
The reports will contain a review of the previous activities against the annual plan, and&#13;
make recommendations for improvement. Annex 15 provides a progress reporting&#13;
blueprint, including performance indicators and progress report format, during the project&#13;
implementation period. Data from GOI's implementation monitoring (see Annex 14) can&#13;
also be used to support the progress reports. Each year, an annual review meeting wilU be&#13;
held in October/November, in time for reflection of the recommendations in the next&#13;
year's budget. A mid-term review will be held by March 31, 1998 [see para. 6.1(e)].&#13;
Within six months after the closing of the project, the DGPSE will submit an&#13;
implementation completion report to the Bank.&#13;
3.16 Technical Audits. In addition, technical audits of project implementation will be&#13;
carried out by April 1 in each year, starting April 1, 1997 during the implementation of the&#13;
project (except for the years of the mid-term review and the Implementation Completion&#13;
Report) by an independent, qualified firn, to conduct a review of key project activities&#13;
[see para. 6.1(f)]. The audit will be conducted in a sample of provinces. The monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities (see para. 3.7) that will be carried out as described in Annex 14,&#13;
including the on-site visits and the in-depth studies will provide the basic information for&#13;
the technical audits.&#13;

4.3     Contingency Alloances.  Physical contingencies (USS11.9 million) represent&#13;
4 percent and price contingencies (US$28.4 million) 9 percent of basline costs. Physical&#13;
contingencies have been allocated as follows: 10 percent for SLTP textbooks; and&#13;
5 percent for all other categories, including educational materials, TA, overseas training_&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
and workshops. Price contingencies have been calculated at 5 percent per year for local&#13;
costs and at 2.2 percent for foreign costs for all categories except textbooks.  For&#13;
textbooks, price contingencies have been calculated at 7 percent (local cost) to take into&#13;
account world wide expected price increases for paper. For SD books, no contingencies&#13;
have been calculated.&#13;
4.4   Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$37.4&#13;
million (representing 11 percent of total project costs) and are based on a detailed analysis&#13;
of expenditures under similar projects in Indonesia. The foreign exchange percentages for&#13;
the major expenditure categories are estimated as follows: (a) textbooks - 10 percent;&#13;
(b) overseas training and international consultants - 90 percent; (c) local training -&#13;
15 percent; and (d) project management - 19 percent.&#13;
4.5   Taxes and Duties. Taxes and duties are estimated at US$0.3 million, based on the&#13;
current 10 percent value added tax on all contracts for goods and materials and tax&#13;
exemption of educational books.&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
4.6   The total project cost of US$355.2 million equivalent would be financed by a&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$132.5 million equivalent, covering 37 percent of total project&#13;
costs, excluding taxes (51 percent of foreign and 36 percent of local expenditures). The&#13;
Government would finance the remaining costs of US$222.7 million equivalent (63 percent&#13;
of total project costs including taxes), as detailed in Table 4.3 below. For SD books, the&#13;
funds need not be located in the development budget, but should be provided in the&#13;
Government's overall education budget. Table 4.4 shows the loan allocation of central vs&#13;
provincial funding by category of expenditure, which shows 90 percent of loan finds&#13;
located at Kanwil level. This would be done through annual Kanwil-level development&#13;
budgets.&#13;

4.7   Financial Sustainability. Counterpart funding for the project would be provided&#13;
for under the national government development budget (APBN/DIP) of MOEC. This is in&#13;
line with the current funding of textbooks and reading books for SLTP schools. Most of&#13;
the GOI-supported funding for SD books would come from the INPRES SD funds. The&#13;
Government would gradually increase its funding of textbooks (both for SD and SLTP)&#13;
during the project from an initial Rp 75 billion to Rp 180 billion after four years,&#13;
representing a 140 percent increase over the project period. This would be accomplished&#13;
through gradually transferring existing INPRES SD funds from school construction to&#13;
purchasing of textbooks.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.8   The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement in the following&#13;
expenditure categories:&#13;
(a)   Textbooks and Teachers' Guides (US$143.4 million equivalent).  As&#13;
detailed in Annex 7, SLTP books would be procured by the Kanwils in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The Kanwils would&#13;
use the list of nationally approved SLTP textbooks, and invite bids from all&#13;
qualified suppliers who meet production and distribution requirements.&#13;
Packages of US$200,000 or more would be based on the modified&#13;
&#13;

radio and TV programs for the reading promotion and teacher education&#13;
components, and national shopping. Each contract for development and&#13;
production of educational promotional materials is estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$200,000. Contracts for development of a series of educational&#13;
promotional materials, including radio and TV program3, for the reading&#13;
promotion and teacher education components, estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000 per contract up to an aggregate of US$5.5 million equivalent,&#13;
may be awarded by direct contracting. Educational promotional materials&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$50,000 and less than US$200,000 per&#13;
contract and up to an aggregate of US$3.5 million would be awarded on the&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.10   The proposed loan of US$132.5 million equivalent would be disbursed over a&#13;
period of 5 years (see Annex 13). Disbursements are expected to be completed by&#13;
October 1, 2000, the Loan Closing Date. The disbursement schedule is based on the&#13;
implementation schedule and the disbursement profile for education and training projects in&#13;
Indonesia. Disbursements estimated for FY96 are based on the proposed initial deposit into&#13;
the project Special Account and replenishment. Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;
Amount         % of expenditures&#13;
Category                (US$ million)      to be financed&#13;
(1)  Textbooks and teachers' guides for&#13;

4.11 Disbursements from the loan for contracts for goods valued at or above&#13;
US$200,000; overseas training programs and consulting firms valued at or above&#13;
US$100,000; and individual consultants valued at or above US$50,000 will be made against&#13;
full documentation.  All other disbursements would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditure, for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies, and&#13;
made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions. In order to facilitate&#13;
disbursements, the Government would establish a Special Account in the amount up to&#13;
US$6 million in Bank Indonesia. This account would be maintained by the Directorate&#13;
General of Budget, MOP. All disbursements from the Bank Loan would be made through&#13;
the Special Account. Replenishment applications to the Special Account will be made on a&#13;
monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes&#13;
first.&#13;

E. ACCOUNTs, AuDrrs, AND RzIoTS&#13;
4.12 Designated govunment authorities would establish project accounts for all project&#13;
expendiures, to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practOes. Accounts&#13;
and documentation supporting the Statements of Expendi  and Special Account would&#13;
be maintained separately. The PMU would consolidate and prepare the financial report.&#13;
The financid tatements and financial report for each fiscal year would be audited by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would contain a separate&#13;
opinion by the auditors as to whether the Statements of Exp , sbmitted during the&#13;
year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in ther prepaation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
4.13 Certified copies of the financial reports on the project for each fiswal year, together&#13;
with the audito's statement, would be fuInished to the Bank as soon as available, but not&#13;
later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year.&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1   Benefs  Successfil implementation of the project would result in increased&#13;
availability, improved quality, and greater use of textbooks for basic education. The&#13;
ulimate benefit would be increased educational quality and improvements in literacy in&#13;
schools. The immediate benefits would be quality enhancement of text books, increased&#13;
access to textbooks by all students, and stronger private sector book production in general&#13;
and of school books in particular. The project would provide a total of 250 million&#13;
textbooks, and will result in a major revision of the school book production and distribution&#13;
system. The latter alone is already of major benefit to the more rapid development of the&#13;
private book industry.&#13;
5.2  Investment in textbooks in other countries has shown, through a substantial research&#13;
body, that improvements in quality are substantial, while textbooks generally represent only&#13;
a small proportion of the education budget (in Indonesia, 4 percent of the primary education&#13;
budget). Overall, investments in primary and secondary education achieve high social rates&#13;
of return, by comparison to other education inputs. The continuing provision of textbooks&#13;
will have a substantial quality benefit, at a relatively low cost. Other benefits are the&#13;
increase in private sector involvement and the purchase of books in large series, which&#13;
should result in a reduction in book prices, estimated at 20 percent.&#13;
5.3   Risks. The project would be exposed to some risks, but those seem manageable.&#13;
(a)   There is strong Government commitment on the policy to provide complete&#13;
coverage of textbooks to all students, and to allocate sufficient budget to&#13;
become fully sustainable after project completion. The budget amount&#13;
currently allocated for SD school construction would be partly transferred to&#13;
allow procurement of books, ensuring long-term sustainability.&#13;
(b)   Procurement procedures and involvement from the private sector will&#13;
require a great deal of adjustment, while improving textbook quality. The&#13;
procedures that will be followed provide for adequate quality control at the&#13;
national level, through the National Evaluation and Approval Committee.&#13;
Sufficient competition in the bidding process will also result in lower prices&#13;
for the textbooks.&#13;
(c)   The decentralization of procurement to the provincial level will require the&#13;
acquisition of skdlls and expertise in the Kanwil that currently may not exist&#13;
or be inadequate. Kanwil offices will be supported throughout the project&#13;
period with technical assistance, to ensure that provincial staff become&#13;
capable in carrying out their new functions.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:&#13;
(a)   Establishment of the National Textbook Evaluation Committee (NTEC) in&#13;
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, not later than&#13;
October 1, 1995 [para. 3.4(b)];&#13;
(b)   Indicators and Terms of Reference for Monitoring and Evaluation Activities&#13;
would be prepared not later than October 1, 1995 (para.3.7);&#13;
(c)   Establishment and maintenance of the PMU with assigned responsibilities&#13;
and of the Book Center PIU starting not later than October 1, 1995&#13;
(para. 3.9);&#13;
(d)   Establishment of Kanwil PIUs, including related consultants' services, and of&#13;
procurement committees in each province by November 30, 1995 [para.&#13;
3.4(a) and 3.9];&#13;
(e)   Mid-term review to be carried out, together with the Bank by March 31,&#13;
1998 (para. 3.15); and&#13;
(f)   Technical audits of Project implementation to be carried out by April 1 in&#13;
each year, starting with April 1, 1997 (except for the mid-term and final&#13;
year) (para. 3.16).&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
6.2   Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project is suitable for&#13;
a Bank Loan of US$132.5 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia for a term of 20&#13;
years, including a grace period of five years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
BooK INDUSRY&#13;
1.    The Market. The salient feature of the book industry in Indonesia is the limited&#13;
extent of the market. A general-book publisher will be satisfied if its sales are 3,000 copies&#13;
a year for the average title on its list. A book is considered a best seller if it sells more than&#13;
about 10,000 copies a year. One of the principal reasons for the limited number of book&#13;
sales lies with weak demand. For many reasons, the number of Indonesians that would like&#13;
to buy books, at present prices, is relatively small. The reading public for books by&#13;
mainstream publishers is restricted mainly to a section of the middle- and upper-income&#13;
groups.&#13;
2.    Regulatory Environment. With the exception of schoolbooks, the Government&#13;
imposes very few regulations on publishers, distributors, and printers. Business permits and&#13;
industxy permits are easy to obtain. Censorship does not appear to be a great concern to&#13;
publishers. There are no special restrictions on foreign investment in the publishing or&#13;
printing businesses. Therefore, the only barrier to entry into the publishing business is the&#13;
need for a relatively small amount of capital, mainly working capital.&#13;
3.    Publishing. According to IKAPI (the Indonesian Publishers' Association), 7,229&#13;
new titles were published in 1991, compared with 1,421 in 1981-an average annual&#13;
compound growth rate of 18 percent Again according to IKAPL 40 million books were&#13;
produced in 1991, compared with 21 million in 1981-an average annual compound growth&#13;
rate of 7 percent. Assuming an average book price of Rp 2,900 (70 percent schoolbooks at&#13;
Rp 2,000 and 30 percent general books at Rp 5,000), total gross sales revenue might be&#13;
about Rp 116 billion in 1991. The 1992 book list from EKAPI lists 273 publishers that are&#13;
IKAPI members and an additional 181 nonmembers. Other data for 1991 showed a total of&#13;
254 publishers in Indonesia, 145 of which were in Jakarta and 85 in the rest of Java, leaving&#13;
only 24 outside Java. Data on industiy concentration are difficult to obtain. Incomplete data&#13;
from IKAPI suggest that the top four publishers account for no more than 10 percent of the&#13;
total number of book copies sold. It is generally believed in the trade that schoolbook&#13;
publishers are more highly concentrated.&#13;
4.    Noteworthy features of the Indonesian publishing industry include a lack of skilled&#13;
labor in many areas of the business: editorial work, translation, management, marketing.&#13;
These deficiencies are not unique to the publishing industry, but the lack of market&#13;
knowledge is more unique. Very little formal market research is carried out to learn who&#13;
readers are and what they want. Publishers feel that it is too expensive to conduct market&#13;
surveys, and they question their value. Instead, good publishers study market trends and&#13;
carry out informal observations at bookstores to see who is reading and buying different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -                           ANNEX S&#13;
kinds of books. There is a tendency to focus attention on the government as customer rather&#13;
than on the ultimate consumer of books. Pressure groups lobby to get lucrative government&#13;
contracts, since there are greater profits to be realized this way than by taking the trouble to&#13;
size up and cater to the market of anonymous consumers. Other characteristics of the&#13;
publishing industry that may affect its ability to respond quickly to changing demand are the&#13;
following:&#13;
*      A common opinion is that it is difficult to find good local authors because of the low&#13;
level of remuneration. Royalties run 5-15 percent of the list price, which is normal&#13;
in the trade, but since the expected production quantity is low (3,000 copies sold in&#13;
two years would not be unusual), the incentive may not be enough to entice many&#13;
talented writers. This is one of several vicious circles found in the Indonesian&#13;
publishing business.&#13;
Many publishers appear to set their prices based on untested assumptions and do not&#13;
give enough attention to more sophisticated pricing strategies.&#13;
*     Most publishers pay little attention to advertising and promotion as a way to generate&#13;
sales. They feel they cannot afford it-an example of another vicious circle.&#13;
5.    The unauthorized reproduction of locally produced books (pirating) is considered a&#13;
serious problem by publishers, but its true extent is not known. While some best-selling&#13;
novels are pirated, most affected seem to be those books with a steady long-term demand,&#13;
such as dictionaries and other reference books; these books present the least risk for the&#13;
pirate. Textbooks are also prime targets. Investigation of the offense and enforcement of the&#13;
copyright law by government authorities are weak, though recently, more attention has been&#13;
given to the issue.&#13;
6.    Printers. It is difficult to know how many book printers there are. Lists of printers&#13;
are of little use, since many are commercial printers, dealing in forms, stationery, product&#13;
packaging, etc. Many printers exist in name only, having been set up to profit from various&#13;
government contracts. They then subcontract out the work to genuine print shops. There&#13;
are a great number of book printers in the Jakarta area, entry is easy, and competition is&#13;
intense. Little investment is needed to start up a small print shop; many exist in the back&#13;
rooms of people's homes. There is great variation in size and competence, and, according to&#13;
reports, many printers lack technical and managerial skills. The greatest potential constraint&#13;
for printers in general is paper supply, but Jakarta printers have no complaints on this count&#13;
at the present time. Printers keep very little paper in stock, as they can obtain it quickly from&#13;
their distributors.&#13;
7.    Distribution and Independent Wholesalers/Distributors.  Some publishers&#13;
complain about the difficulties of distributing their books, but the real problem is often that&#13;
their books will not sell or that they know little about marketing. Distribution is a complex&#13;
problem in the book business because of the highly differentiated nature of the product: each&#13;
of many bookstores needs to have the products of many publishers. The problem is being&#13;
addressed in a number of ways in Indonesia, and it appears that the private sector is capable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-                             ANNEX5&#13;
of developing new solutions to meet the evolving demand of publishers. Publishers&#13;
generally deal with the large bookstores (e.g., the chains) directly, and then perhaps use&#13;
independent distributors to reach the smaller stores. Distribution by publishers is handled&#13;
routinely. There is very little training of sales representatives; little promotion is carried out;&#13;
it is usually expected that the book will sell itself to even the smaller retail outlets.&#13;
8.    It is estimated that there are about 10 important distributors in the Jakarta area and&#13;
about 50 in Indonesia as a whole. Most distributors receive the greater part of their revenue&#13;
from the distribution of schoolbooks. There are a number of specialized distributors, e.g.,&#13;
for dictionaries and other reference books, medical books, etc. Independent distributors are&#13;
performing a useful service in the book business:&#13;
They cut down on administrative and shipping costs by consolidating orders and&#13;
shipments.&#13;
They give the same trade discount to bookstores regardless of how many books are&#13;
purchased from a single publisher, whereas the small bookstore would often receive&#13;
a lower rate on a small order placed directly with the publisher.&#13;
They can help deal with the problem of uncollectible accounts, because bargaining&#13;
power is increased when many publishers' accounts are consolidated.&#13;
9.    Shipping. Shipping costs account for 1-2 percent of a book's list price on average.&#13;
Many shipping methods are used: post office, air freight, private shipping agents, and freight&#13;
forwarders. Private shipping agents and forwarders, who give speedy, reliable, door-to-door&#13;
service, are preferred for large shipments-say, for more than five kilograms (usually 15-30&#13;
books). Within Java, costs are very low. For most of the distant locations in Indonesia,&#13;
shipping costs by private shipping agents amount to no more than 5 percent of the retail&#13;
value. Surface parcel post generally cannot compete because of the long delivery time,&#13;
though it has the advantage of being inexpensive and capable of reaching more parts of the&#13;
country than the private-sector services.  The high cost of air parcel post becomes&#13;
burdensome for direct mail sales of just a few books, unless their value is relatively high.&#13;
10.   Retailers. According to IKAPI (1992 book list), there are 2,895 bookstores in&#13;
Indonesia, 346 in Jakarta and 1,381 in the rest of Java. It is not known for how many of&#13;
these the major activity is book selling or how many have more than a tiny range of titles in&#13;
stock. A recurring opinion is that most Indonesian bookstores lack management skills,&#13;
marketing strategies, and well-trained staff who can lead people to the books they might&#13;
want.&#13;
11.   National and local chains together probably account for more than half of all book&#13;
sales from bookstores. The chains are competitive and will take potentially marketable&#13;
books from any publisher, apparently without discrimination. Several companies are&#13;
involved in door-to-door sales of encyclopedias and similar books. Some publishers have&#13;
tried mail-order sales without much success: the response rate is low. One successful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38 -                          ANNEX S&#13;
company, however, has a list of about 75,000 confirmed buyers throughout Indonesia, even&#13;
outside major towns, where well-supplied bookstores are scarce.&#13;
12.   Book Imports. There is no import duty on book imports. But unofficial fees may&#13;
work out to 4-8 percent of the sales price of the books. The import process is usually fairly&#13;
rapid, taking about two weeks.&#13;
13.  Informal Sector: Cheap ("Pasar") Books. Alongside the conventional book&#13;
industiy exists another, operating through different channels, and catering to a different&#13;
segment of the market. In Indonesia, true mass-market books are sold in the traditional&#13;
bazaars (pasar) and by street vendors. There, cheap romance and horror novels sell for&#13;
Rp 1,000, compared with some Rp 3,000 for a bookstore novel. The language and style are&#13;
simple and the physical quality of the books is poor. Very little appears to be known in a&#13;
systematic way about this informal segment of the industry, which is unhindered by&#13;
government regulation or controls. Readers appear to come mainly from segments of the&#13;
population below the middle-income groups, many perhaps with only a primary school&#13;
education.&#13;
14.   Exports of Books. Exports of books are insignificant at the present time, amounting&#13;
to only US$594,000 in 1992. But several printers believe that, if paper costs could be&#13;
reduced, Indonesia could offer competitive prices for printing jobs done for foreign&#13;
publishers. Export printing jobs are undertaken from time to time-often, it appears, with&#13;
Singapore publishers.&#13;
15.   The School Textbook Industry. The production of school textbooks is a very&#13;
different business from the production of ordinary books for several reasons:  first, the&#13;
Government itself plays a direct role in producing these books; second, school textbooks&#13;
published by the private sector must first be approved by the Government; third, the&#13;
particular nature of demand for the books is shaped by the school curricula and national&#13;
exams developed by the government. There are three primary actors in the production of&#13;
textbooks for primary and secondary schools. (1) The Book Center (Pusbuk) is the unit&#13;
within the Department of Education and Culture (MOEC) responsible for the production and&#13;
distribution of free textbooks. (2) Perum Balai Pustaka, a state-owned enterprise, is the&#13;
printing house of MOEC. It reprints the books produced by the Book Center and, in&#13;
addition, publishes its own textbooks and other books. (3) Private publishers are permitted&#13;
to produce and sell school textbooks so long as they have been approved by MOEC, in&#13;
particular the Directorate of Educational Facilities (Direktorat Sarana Pendidikan).&#13;
(a)  Book Center. The Book Center produces main textbooks for certain subjects.&#13;
(b)  Balai Pustaka. Balai Pustaka reprints Book Center book, and sells them as if&#13;
it were a private publishers. Distribution is mainly carried out by private&#13;
distributors. A rough estimate suggests that Balai Pustaka is covering&#13;
5-7 percent of core-subject textbook needs. The figures make it clear either&#13;
that demand for "required" books is lacking or that Balai Pustaka is not able to&#13;
supply the number of books demanded.  Balai Pustaka also develops&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                          ANNEX 5&#13;
supplementary texts entirely on its own, as if it were a private publisher. The&#13;
approval process is the same as for supplementary texts published by private&#13;
publishers. Balai Pustaka sometimes issues a supplementary text for the same&#13;
course for which it is reprinting a required text.&#13;
(c)   Private Sector. Private publishers are free to produce and distribute school&#13;
textbooks so long as the books have been approved by the Directorate of&#13;
Educational Facilities in MOEC. The basic procedure involves an evaluation&#13;
and clearance by the Directorate of Educational Facilities of the text submitted&#13;
by a private publisher. The books must be in complete, ready-to-sell form (no&#13;
proofs accepted). An evaluation team looks at four aspects: contents, national&#13;
security and state philosophy, language, design and physical quality. If the&#13;
book submitted by the private publishers is for one of the designated courses, it&#13;
is by definition considered a "supplementary text," since "main texts" for&#13;
these courses are a government monopoly, produced by the Book Center. In&#13;
practice, the contents may be exactly like that of a main text, and the book may&#13;
be used as a main text by the school or teacher. Once the book is approved, the&#13;
private publisher carries out the rest of the process without further government&#13;
supervision or regulation. Promotion takes place at the levels of the provincial&#13;
MOEC office and school. Private publishers like to sell direct to schools and&#13;
teachers.&#13;
16.   Reading/Library Books. Reading/library books (buku bacaan) are intended for&#13;
school libraries. In the "Inpres SD" program, directed at primary school libraries, the&#13;
Directorate of Educational Facilities purchases from private publishers. Some book titles are&#13;
specifically developed by publishers with a view to selling them to the Inpres SD program;&#13;
many of these books are of little interest to children and would generate negligible sales if an&#13;
attempt were made to sell them in bookstores. However, the result of the Inpres SD&#13;
program can be a boon to a private publisher, who might otherwise be selling only 2,000-&#13;
4,000 copies of the book through normal channels. Books were purchased from 151&#13;
publishers in 1992/93. This program may have a considerable impact on aggregate demand&#13;
for books. Based on IKAPI figures for total book production during the period 1988-91,&#13;
15 percent of all books produced were purchased through the Inpres SD program.&#13;
17.   The Book Center is responsible for library books at the high school level. The size of&#13;
the program is much smaller than the Inpres SD program, however. In contrast to the SD&#13;
program, only a small percentage of the books are selected and purchased directly by the&#13;
Book Center; most are purchased by the provincial MOEC offices at their own discretion,&#13;
usually from local bookstores.&#13;
18.   The Price of Books. An analysis of the costs of producing and selling a typical&#13;
book is useful for estimating what the impact on the average price would be if publishers&#13;
sold more of each title, instead of the 1,000-4,000 that is said to be typical now. The price&#13;
decrease comes about because the fixed costs involved in the production of each title can be&#13;
spread over a larger number of copies. Increasing the number of copies sold would have a&#13;
considerable impact on the average price. For a publisher now selling in the range of 3,000-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -                           ANNEX 5&#13;
6,000 copies, doubling production would permit a decrease of 25-30 percent in the price of&#13;
its books.&#13;
19.   Paper is relatively expensive, but almost all the paper used in book production in&#13;
Indonesia is now produced domestically; only special papers are sometimes imported. The&#13;
quality of the best local paper is quite good, though there is considerable variability among&#13;
producers. The tariffs on ordinary printing paper (25 percent) and newsprint (40 percent)&#13;
are higher than needed, but the likely impact on the price of a book is limited; prices would&#13;
come down by no more than 6 percent if tariffs were reduced to zero.&#13;
20.   Publishers and distributors with annual sales over Rp 120 million and retailers (e.g.,&#13;
bookstores) with sales over Rp 1 billion must register and pay VAT of 10 percent on the sale&#13;
of books. However, the Govermnent has made the decision to declare certain kinds of books&#13;
nontaxable: (a) books used by schools, universities, etc., in support of the curriculum; and&#13;
(b) sacred scriptures and other educational religious books. Publishers must submit their&#13;
requests for nontaxable status through IEAPI. IKAPI then forwards the books to the&#13;
appropriate department (Education or Religion) for its recommendation. The list is then sent&#13;
to the Department of Finance for final approval. The entire process is said to take three to&#13;
four months. IKAPI estimates that about 90 percent of all titles in print have been declared&#13;
nontaxable.&#13;

TEXTBOOK PROVISION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Basic Assumptions:&#13;
1.    Enrollments&#13;
Enrollments used for calculating the number of textbooks are for 1998/99, as&#13;
provided by MOEC. This ensures some margin for the supply of textbooks so that&#13;
shortages can be avoided. While for Primary education there is only a slight difference&#13;
between the present and projected enrollments, for junior secondary education, the&#13;
Government's expansion target is about 4.5 percent per annum during this period.&#13;
2.    Teachers and Teacher Guides&#13;
(a)   Total number of teachers for primary schools was provided by MOEC. The&#13;
number of classroom teachers was estimated on the basis of the number of&#13;
classrooms. Each classroom teacher is provided with five teacher guides for&#13;
grades SD1 and SD2, and seven for grades SD3 - SD6. Sports teachers are&#13;
provided with a teacher guide each (see footnote in Table 3).&#13;
(b)   The number of teacher guides for junior secondary schools was calculated on the&#13;
basis of the number of schools, assuming that each school has three grades. As the&#13;
number of subjects for each grade is 12, the number of teacher guides required for&#13;
each school is 36.&#13;
3.    Textbook Prices&#13;
(a)   Unit costs of textbooks were based on the figures provided by MOEC and include&#13;
10 percent escalation cost. Paper is of good quality (60 grams per square meter&#13;
for the text and 180 grams per square meter for the cover). Since costs vary with&#13;
the volume of production it was assumed that: (i) for primary school textbooks,&#13;
the average production will be in the range of 50,000-100,000 per title, and for&#13;
teacher guides, in the range of 25,000-50,000; (ii) for junior secondary school&#13;
textbooks, the average production of both textbooks and teacher guides was&#13;
estimated to be in the range of 25,000-50,000.&#13;
(b)   For primary school, unit costs were differentiated by grade as follows:&#13;
Grades 1 and 2     Rp 1,500 per book&#13;
Grades 3 and 4     Rp 2,000 per book&#13;
Grades 5 and 6     Rp 2,500 per book&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                        ANNEX 6&#13;
For teacher guides, the average unit cost was estimated at Rp 3,000 per book.&#13;
(c)   For junior secondary schools, the average unit cost of textbooks was estimated at&#13;
Rp 2,500 per book and for teacher guides, Rp 3,000 per book.&#13;
4.    Transportation Costs&#13;
Transportation costs vary substantially from province to province. Based on past&#13;
experience provinces were divided into four categories as shown in the relevant&#13;
Tables. Transportation costs per category is as follows:&#13;
Category A         5% of book cost&#13;
Category B        7% of book cost&#13;
Category C         20% of book cost&#13;
Category D        Rp 2,000 per book.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
BOOK PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Textbooks&#13;
1.    The procurement of textbooks and the related teachers' guides under the project&#13;
would consist of purchase of all necessary textbooks and teachers' guides at a 1:1&#13;
book:student ratio for all subjects in all SLTP schools (procurement of books for SD&#13;
schools would continue under sole GOI funding and procedures). The selection and&#13;
procurement of the books would be carried out at each of the 27 provincial education&#13;
offices (Kanwil) with input from school principals, and would be based on a list of&#13;
successfully tendered titles.&#13;
2.    The main components of textbook procurement are as follows:&#13;
(a)   The series (of titles for grades 1-3) to be selected may be published by&#13;
either private publishers or Balai Pustaka. Only series that have been&#13;
reviewed and approved through a National Textbook Evaluation&#13;
Committee (NTEC) can be placed on the list for possible selection, and&#13;
Kanwils are required to select only from this Approved List.&#13;
(b)   Procurement will be carried out at the provincial level by Kanwils, which&#13;
will select for tendering a minimum of three approved series for each&#13;
subject.&#13;
(c)   For series from the private sector, bids will be accepted from publishers&#13;
(i.e., those holding the copyright/publishing rights to the series ) or&#13;
booksellers/distributors working in association with the copyright holders.&#13;
For series from Balai Pustaka, in which publishing rights are deemed to be&#13;
non-proprietary, bids may be accepted from any qualified company&#13;
(publisher, printer, bookseller, etc.) if successful such a bidder will enter&#13;
into a license agreement with Balai Pustaka. All bidders will be required to&#13;
post-qualifSy in conjunction with the bid itself.&#13;
(d)   MOEC will review all selections made before contracts are awarded.&#13;
Further details on the procedures follow.&#13;
Evaluation and Approval Process&#13;
3.    A National Textbook Evaluation Committee will be established in MOEC, to&#13;
evaluate textbooks and approve those to be included in the approved list for procurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-                            ANNEX7&#13;
The Committee should include relevant government officials from different government&#13;
departments, to evaluate the legal, national, security, and book quality aspects; it should&#13;
also include principals, teachers and IKIP staff. The Committee could also co-opt non-&#13;
government members, on an ad-hoc basis, depending on the subject and the requirements;&#13;
these would be in an advisor or observer capacity.&#13;
4.    Titles must form a series comprising work for all three grades of SLTP, preferably&#13;
(but not necessarily) in the format of one pupils' book and teachers' guide per grade (or&#13;
one teachers' guide per grade where no pupils' books are required). Titles can be&#13;
submitted by either private publishers (local or foreign) or Balai Pustaka for evaluation by&#13;
the Committee. Titles can be submitted either as ready printed books or as unpublished&#13;
camera-ready copy (CRC) with a printed sample chapter. Clear and specific pedagogical&#13;
and technical criteria will be established on the minimum quality required (with standards&#13;
set sufficiently high to guarantee good pedagogical quality and technical durability); and a&#13;
merit point system will be developed to reflect the relative weight that should be attached&#13;
to each pedagogical criterion in order to enable quality comparisons.  The criteria&#13;
developed for the Book and Reading Development Project proposal can be used as a basis&#13;
for further development. A minimum of three approved titles will be required for each&#13;
grade before tendering can begin.&#13;
5.    Written feedback will be prepared for each title (series), and publishers will have&#13;
access to this feedback for their own titles in order to assist them with revisions. Titles&#13;
which do not reach the required number of merit points (80 percent) will be returned to&#13;
the publishers unapproved; such titles may be re-submitted for a second evaluation and&#13;
possible approval after revision according to the suggestions of the evaluation panel. The&#13;
merit points scored by each title will be incorporated into the technical evaluation of any&#13;
bids resulting from selection by the Kanwils.&#13;
Procurement Process&#13;
6.    At the national level, advertisements will be placed within Indonesia and&#13;
internationally (in line with Bank guidelines), inviting publishers to submit series for&#13;
inclusion in the evaluation process, with a view to possible selection for bidding. After the&#13;
evaluation process has been completed, the full list of approved textbook series and&#13;
evaluation scores will be sent to all Kanwils, together with (at least 2) copies of each&#13;
approved book/CRC.&#13;
7.    At the provincial level, Kanwils will select from the list at least three series for&#13;
each subject (basing their choices on local content, relevance, experience, etc.). Bids will&#13;
be invited for supply and distribution of each of the selected series. For series from&#13;
private publishers, bids will only be accepted from de facto copyright/publishing rights&#13;
holders (whether under license or original proprietors) or from booksellers bidding in&#13;
association with the rights holders. For series published by Balai Pustaka, in which&#13;
copyright is non-proprietary, bids will be accepted from any qualified supplier (whether&#13;
printer, distributor or other). Post-qualification will require the bidders to show, as part of&#13;
their offers, that they have both the organizational and financial capacities to accomplish&#13;
the work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                         ANNEX 7&#13;
8.    Scheduling of the advertising, evaluation and bidding procedures must be sufficient&#13;
to allow reasonable time for each of the processes. The National Textbook Evaluation&#13;
Committee will therefore set deadlines for the various stages of the process, and will&#13;
announce the dates as part of the advertisement procedures: (a) dates and procedures for&#13;
obtaining guidelines on submission of manuscripts for evaluation and approval; (b) final&#13;
date for submission of titles to ensure inclusion on the Approval List for the first round of&#13;
bidding; (c) timing of the notification of evaluation results to publishers; (d) final date for&#13;
re-submission of books not initially approved to ensure their inclusion on the Approved&#13;
List for the first round of bidding. However, procurement schedules should not be&#13;
delayed solely for the purpose of second-round evaluation (publishers will, in any case,&#13;
have opportunities to enter the bidding process during the second year of the Project).&#13;
9.    All the books to be purchased will be in Bahasa Indonesia, and non-Indonesian&#13;
bidders will be required to show a competence in this language. Furthermore, in order to&#13;
facilitate the bid evaluation process at the Kanwil level, bids will be supplied in both&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia and English. (The bid evaluation will be carried out using the Bahasa&#13;
Indonesia versions, though in the case of foreign bids the ruling language in cases of&#13;
dispute will be English). Specific evaluation criteria for all of the components will be&#13;
developed and included in the bid documents (which will be provided in both languages).&#13;
10.   In order to permit the bidders to plan the distribution component accurately, the&#13;
bidding documents will include the address of each school that will receive the books and&#13;
the number of copies required for each school (plus a 5 percent overage). In order to&#13;
ensure that the publisher/producer retains an investment in the distribution process,&#13;
contracts will be written to provide (against suitable guarantees) for 10 percent payment&#13;
on signing of contract, 40 percent payment on completion of production (e.g., against&#13;
shipping documents), and the final 50 percent on completion of delivery to schools&#13;
(against signed and stamped delivery dockets). Schools will retain copies of the delivery&#13;
dockets for stock-keeping and later monitoring and supervision purposes.&#13;
11.   Bids will be evaluated on the basis of technical and financial components, which&#13;
will be evaluated separately. The aim of the bid evaluation is to place greater emphasis on&#13;
the quality of the book, while retaining price competitiveness. The winning bid will be&#13;
that which is ranked highest. Domestic preference will be in accordance with the Bank&#13;
Guidelines, January 1995 (Annex 2).&#13;
12.   The Financial bid will include the Unit Price per copy supplied on CIP basis to&#13;
each SLTP school in the province, broken down into two subcomponents for comparison&#13;
purposes: unit price per copy CIF the respective provincial capital; and average unit cost&#13;
of distribution to each SLTP school in the province. Points for the Financial Score are&#13;
comparative with the lowest (adjusted) bid, which automatically achieves the maximum&#13;
(20) points. Points are then awarded to each bid according to the equation:&#13;
Merit points =    Value of lowest (adjusted bid)  x 20&#13;
Value of (adjusted) bid under evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                         ANNEX 7&#13;
13.   The Technical Bid will comprise four subcomponents with the following suggested&#13;
weightings:&#13;
(a)   Technical quality of the book (i.e., that it meets the minimum technical&#13;
specifications required and is therefore responsive to the bid request), and&#13;
technical capacity of bidder to perform the services required - YIN (i.e., no&#13;
merit points to be scored).&#13;
(b)   Pedagogical score achieved during the approval process (taken from&#13;
selection list) - maximum 40 points, calculated according to the formula:&#13;
Merit points = Percentage awarded by NTEC x 40&#13;
100&#13;
(c)   Detailed plan of distribution to each school, showing mode of delivezy and&#13;
proposed delivery schedule - maximum 15 points.&#13;
(d)   A proposal on how the supplier intends to make the series commercially&#13;
available within the province - maximum 5 points.&#13;
In order to ensure that distribution and marketing will be successful,&#13;
bidders must receive at least ten of the twenty merit points for items (c)&#13;
and (d) combined. Bids not attaining this level will be deemed non-&#13;
responsive.&#13;
14.   On the basis of the evaluation, one series per subject will be selected for use in all&#13;
schools in the particular province, and will be introduced in all three grades&#13;
simultaneously. The possible disruption caused by introduction of a different series (e.g.,&#13;
for Grade 3 pupils) is assumed to be low (due to existing book:pupil ratios) and short-&#13;
term because of the present low book:pupil ratios, and would be outweighed by the&#13;
advantages of improved supply and distribution.&#13;
Review Process&#13;
15.   The selected bids will be reviewed by MOEC in Jakarta and by the Bank.&#13;
B. Textbook Evaluation and Approval Procedures&#13;
Textbooks and Related Teachers' Guides&#13;
16.   The objectives of the evaluation and approval procedure are to:&#13;
(a)   ensure that materials used in schools are of high pedagogical quality,&#13;
presentation and relevance; and&#13;
(b)   assist teachers, principals and other educational officials to identify&#13;
appropriate materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-                           ANNEX 7&#13;
17.   On a national basis, the evaluation and approval process would be planned,&#13;
administered and implemented by the NTEC and technical subcommittees.  Publishers&#13;
would be required to contribute to the funding of the evaluation process by providing&#13;
necessary copies of the evaluation materials. The textbook evaluation criteria given below&#13;
are intended for guidance. The NTEC will be assisted to fully define and weight the actual&#13;
criteria to be used. The final criteria and weightings will be reviewed by the MOEC and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
Textbook Evaluation Criteria&#13;
Textbook&#13;
Any textbook should present correct scientific, technical and other facts using an&#13;
appropriate and acceptable method of presentation, well integrated and clear&#13;
illustrations and layout, and ethically acceptable text.&#13;
Textbook writer&#13;
A textbook writer (either an individual or a team) must have expertise and teaching&#13;
experience in the subject matter and creative skills for the planning and generation&#13;
of manuscripts.&#13;
Criteria for evaluation&#13;
T The evaluation should consider at least five aspects of any textbook, i.e.,&#13;
content, methodology, language, security and graphical presentation.&#13;
Content aspect&#13;
The content aspects of the book should consider:&#13;
* The starting level of knowledge of its readers.&#13;
X Presentation of the material should be consistent with similar disciplines for the&#13;
same educational level.&#13;
* Coverage of the subject matter must be relevant to the scope and sequencing&#13;
of material as expressed in the existing curriculum&#13;
* Information should be linked to suitable questions (with and without given&#13;
answers) and exercises designed to assist the learning process and test pupil&#13;
progress.&#13;
* Information taken from other sources should be acknowledge.&#13;
* For later grades, contents should be indexed where appropriate.&#13;
Methodology aspect&#13;
* The approach used in the book should reflect the approach suggested by the&#13;
curriculum (e.g., pupil-centered, learning by discovery for science).&#13;
* Scope and sequencing should be logically planned, starting with content&#13;
familiar to the pupil, and followed by new, complex and abstract subjects.&#13;
* There should be a clear and consistent hierarchy of presentation (i.e., Chapter,&#13;
Subchapter etc., headings).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-                           ANNEX 7&#13;
Language aspect&#13;
* The language used in the book should be relevant to the users, and easily&#13;
understood according to their language abilities in terms of&#13;
O vocabulary (special terminology, wording, spelling)&#13;
0 sentence structure&#13;
0 paragraphing&#13;
Security aspect&#13;
Textbooks should:&#13;
*  Be in line with and not contradictory to Pancasila, UUD-1945, and MPR&#13;
Decisions.&#13;
*  Be in line with and not contradictory to Government Policies.&#13;
*  Not lead to the disunity of the Nation.&#13;
*  Not be contradictory to the Laws, existing Regulations and Ethics.&#13;
*  Not create conflicts between Religions, Races, Tribes or local cultures and&#13;
traditions.&#13;
Graphical Presentation&#13;
Specifications for graphical presentation must be considered as a single aspect in&#13;
combination with the content being presented. For example, various combinations&#13;
of typeface, font size, line length, margin depths, etc. may be more or less suitable&#13;
for different kinds of material presentation and page format. The specifications&#13;
given below are thus intended only as general guidelines and examples, and more&#13;
detailed specifications will be provided in the bidding documents for each title.&#13;
The following aspects should be considered in book design and layout:&#13;
*  Illustrations (and relevant captions) should support the text, be clear and easily&#13;
understood.&#13;
*  Use of color should be relevant to needs (for economy purposes, screened 2-&#13;
color printing is deemed more efficient than spot 4-color).&#13;
*  Spatial relationships between text and illustrations should be consistent.&#13;
*  Typefaces and font sizes should be selected according to the age and&#13;
experience of the reader (e.g., texts should use a serif typeface, Grade I -&#13;
18-29 pts, Grade II - 16-21 pts, Grade III - 14-18 pts, Grade IV - 12-14 pts,&#13;
Grade V and above - 11-12 pts.&#13;
*  Suitable line lengths are 26-50 ems (depending on the font size).&#13;
*  Suitable line spacing is 1-1.5 (for example 20/24 pts to 20/30 pts).&#13;
*  Suitable book sizes naturally depend very much on press size, but could be A4,&#13;
A5, B5, Crown Quarto, for example.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
BOOK CENTER&#13;
1.    Background. During the 1970s and early-1980s, one of the results of a weak&#13;
private sector publishing industry, combined with insufficiently coordinated government&#13;
efforts, was poor availability of good quality textbooks to the education system. During&#13;
the Integrated Textbook Project, the need was identified for a central body to execute&#13;
operations relating to educational materials, and so the Book Center was founded under&#13;
Presidential Decree (Keppres No. 4 of 1987), and its role elaborated and defined under&#13;
the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture (Kepmen No. 0274/0/1987).&#13;
Under Article 2 of this decree, the Book Center is charged with the development and&#13;
implementation of writing, translation, evaluation, selection, procurement and&#13;
production, and also distribution of books on the basis of the policy defined by the&#13;
Minister of Education and Culture.&#13;
2.    Adjustment. The Book Center must re-emphasize its role as the government&#13;
body responsible for setting educational materials standards, and expand its monitoring&#13;
functions to ensure those standards are met and maintained. In terms of ensuring&#13;
availability of sufficient numbers of quality textbooks, the Book Center must de-&#13;
emphasize its role as a line production and distribution unit, and become increasingly&#13;
involved in guiding and monitoring the private sector production and distribution. A&#13;
carefully planned introduction of quality guidance and control functions must be&#13;
implemented in parallel with the phasing out of line operations. The Book Center will&#13;
carry out these quality control functions in support of the National Evaluation and&#13;
Approval Comrnittee.&#13;
3.    The proposed project would assist the Book Center to focus on its new&#13;
functions as a service center, collaborating with the supporting publishers, and bodies&#13;
such as the National Book Development Council (NBDC), public libraries, IKAPI,&#13;
book reading promotion, NGOs, etc. instead of its present line production and&#13;
distribution center functions.  In general terns, the Book Center's objectives of&#13;
coordinating book issues under the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), and&#13;
ensuring the provision of relevant books to the education sector, would remain&#13;
unchanged. The methods and procedures by which it achieves these objectives would&#13;
be adjusted to take account of the growing capacity of the private sector and the&#13;
Government's wish to encourage this growth. During the project, the Book Center's&#13;
activities would emphasize:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57-                           ANNEX 8&#13;
(a)   strengthening of the policy-making process and monitoring of policy&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(b)    promotion of competition in the publishing industry;&#13;
(c)   facilitating private sector development;&#13;
(d)    making delivery of public services more effective;&#13;
(e)    making decentralization work; and&#13;
(f)    strengthening of copyright legislation and/or enforcement.&#13;
Functions&#13;
4.    Beginning from 1995/1996, the Book Center will focus its activities on, among&#13;
others:&#13;
(a)    Evaluation of textbooks and teachers' guides published by the private&#13;
sectors.&#13;
(b)   Monitoring textbooks distribution.&#13;
(c)    Evaluation of book quality.&#13;
(d)   Handling, organizing training and workshops regularly for:&#13;
- writers&#13;
- translators&#13;
- editors&#13;
- illustrators&#13;
- distributors&#13;
(e)    Writing and distributing handbook for&#13;
- textbook writing&#13;
- textbook publishing&#13;
- evaluation criteria&#13;
- selection criteria&#13;
- criteria of acceptable quality books&#13;
(f)    Setting up Book Information System.&#13;
The Book Center, periodically, will collect, print and disseminate, books&#13;
and price lists published in Indonesia, to the Book consumers, especially&#13;
schools.&#13;
&#13;

Organization&#13;
5.    The organizational structure of the Book Center will remain same as elaborated&#13;
on in the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture, May 8, 1987. The job&#13;
description in the Sections, Subsections, Divisions, and Subdivisions was also clarified&#13;
in the Ministerial Decree, February 12, 1988. The new functions due to the change in&#13;
policy of the provision of textbooks would be accommodated and integrated into the&#13;
existing organization.&#13;
6.    Although the Book Center's responsibility on producing textbooks for primary&#13;
school will finally be transferred to the private sector, it would still perform many of the&#13;
previous functions such as the production of reading materials for vocational and&#13;
secondary education.&#13;

BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECr MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This plan is designed to monitor progress toward the following:&#13;
* How well teachers, parents and administrators understand the objectives and&#13;
procedures of the system.&#13;
* How effectively books are distributed to schools.&#13;
* How effectively teachers and students use them in classrooms.&#13;
There is a compelling body of research evidence that suggests a positive qualitative&#13;
effect on the achievement of children when good textbooks are available to each and every&#13;
student in a classroom. It is further accepted that the availability of supplementary reading&#13;
materials in houses and libraries is positively correlated with enhanced learning in school&#13;
subjects. These positive relationships seem easily explained on three levels; their impact&#13;
on student behavior, on teachers and parents and on the local school environment.&#13;
As far as students are concerned, the presence and ready availability of attractive&#13;
and interesting text-books and supplementary reading materials make it possible for self-&#13;
motivated and interested students to advance their own learning. Even in the presence of&#13;
poor or ineffective teaching, well designed books can become self-instructional tools and&#13;
useful learning aids.&#13;
Interested parents can use these same materials to encourage their children in&#13;
developing good learning habits and motivating them to enrich and extend their school&#13;
experiences.&#13;
Well designed textbooks, and available library and "reading corner" materials,&#13;
often can help even poorly trained teachers perform more effectively. Well structured&#13;
lessons, adequate exercises for drill and practice and clear teachers' guides can be of&#13;
enormous assistance in improving the performance of even the better trained and&#13;
experienced teachers by suggesting new and improved pedagogical techniques.&#13;
Finally, a school that is filled with good, attractive learning materials, with&#13;
sufficient copies for each student and with a rich array of supplemental reading materials,&#13;
is clearly a place dedicated to teaching and learning. The children and adults who occupy&#13;
that building have access to the tools to accomplish a great deal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                       ANNEX 14&#13;
In order for these good effects to occur, three essential goals must be met:&#13;
*  Parents, teachers, school and regional administrators must understand and appreciate&#13;
the objectives of the program and how the "system" functions.&#13;
*  Books and teachers' guide must be delivered to schools in a timely and efficient&#13;
manner and in sufficient number so that each student has access to personal copies.&#13;
*  Books and teachers' guide must be in the hands of students and teachers and used&#13;
appropriately as learning tools.&#13;
Proposed Monitoring Process&#13;
The proposed process would consist of two separate activities:  ongoing&#13;
monitoring from the regular school reports and annual visits to a randomly selected&#13;
number of schools for on-site inspection.&#13;
Indicator #1: How well teachers, parents and administrators understand the new system&#13;
(a)   Ongoing monitoring&#13;
Add 1-5 questions to Information Center's Annual School Report concerning the&#13;
new system. These questions would push teachers' and principals' understanding of how&#13;
the new selection system is designed to function, how to order books, how to prepare&#13;
parents and students for the new textbooks and library materials, etc.&#13;
These reports are aggregated at the district and provincial levels and are sent to&#13;
Jakarta (the Information Center) with about a 90 percent response rate.&#13;
Using existing information on school characteristics, these findings can be reported&#13;
annually by categories of schools and regions, e.g., rural vs. urban, private vs. public, Java&#13;
vs. other, etc.&#13;
(b)   Visits to schools&#13;
Select a sample of 120 SDs and 60 SLTPs from which national data could be&#13;
estimated. Select and train interviewers/observers who would each visit several schools&#13;
each year to:&#13;
(a)   Interview principals, teachers and parents, asking specific questions about&#13;
the new textbooks, how well they are liked, if they seem to be helpful,&#13;
problems with selection, ordering, deliveries, etc.&#13;
(b)   Interview a small number of students asking similar questions.&#13;
(c)   Observe and report activities of two or three classroom sessions involving&#13;
textbooks and library materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82-                      ANNEX 14&#13;
The interviewers' reports would be analyzed and reported by categories of schools&#13;
(e.g., urban vs. rural, etc.) and reports of findings prepared. These findings would be&#13;
compared to those reported in the School Reports and discrepancies noted.&#13;
Visits to schools should be made unannounced and the activity should be done by&#13;
an independent organization. For example universities or teacher training colleges could&#13;
be contracted for this purpose.&#13;
Indicator #2: How effectively books are distributed to schools&#13;
(a)   On-going Monitoring&#13;
Each shipment of books to a Province, a district and a school, will include a simple&#13;
self-addressed, postage-paid post-card which will provide the following information:&#13;
* date books received;&#13;
* condition upon arrival;&#13;
* sufficient quantity or not.&#13;
The returned cards would be sent directly to the Information Center where they&#13;
would be collected and the data analyzed and reported by categories of schools and&#13;
regions of the country, on a quarterly basis.&#13;
(b)   Visits to schools&#13;
Interviewers described above, during their visits to sampled schools (120 SDs and&#13;
120 SLTPs) would ask teachers and principals a small number of questions about&#13;
deliveries, inspect damaged books and report findings.&#13;
indicator #3: How effectively students use their textbooks and the reading materials&#13;
(a)   Annual reporting&#13;
Add 1-5 questions to Information Center's Annual School Report, concering&#13;
teachers' and school principals' perceptions of the appropriateness and effectiveness of&#13;
student usage of textbooks. Other questions would probe sufficiency of quantities and&#13;
impressions of positive or negative effects.&#13;
Resources will have to be provided to the Information Center to extract these data&#13;
from the School Reports, analyze the responses and to report the findings according to&#13;
categories of schools and regions of the country.&#13;
(b)   Visits to schools&#13;
Interviewers described earlier, during their visits to sampled SDs and SLTPs, will&#13;
observe students and teachers during classes using textbooks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83-                      ANNEX 14&#13;
During these observations, they will complete standardized observation check-lists.&#13;
In addition, they will interview teachers and students about the impact of text&#13;
books on the leaming environment of the classroom. These reports will be analyzed and&#13;
findings will be reported by categories of schools and regions of the country.&#13;
Mid-level findings may be used to alter or supplement project activities. Fnal&#13;
findings will describe how well objectives have been met.&#13;

BOOK AND READING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECr IMPLEMENTATIoN REPORTING AND SUPERvisION SCHEDULE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Project progress reporting to the Bank will be on a semi-annual cycle. The half-&#13;
yearly progress report will cover the project status (physical progress, financial and&#13;
performance status) and will include status of the performance indicators. The progress&#13;
report will be prepared in advance of the half-yearly supervision missions from the&#13;
Bank. In this Annex, the details of this reporting process are described.&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
2.    The performance status of the project will be monitored through performance&#13;
indicators. Project performance will be monitored on the basis of several types of&#13;
indicators:&#13;
(a)   Performance Monitoring Against Milestones and Due Dates of&#13;
Implementation Plan&#13;
Annex 11 gives detailed information on the milestones and tasks that&#13;
need to be carried out. At each supervision, these will be reviewed, their&#13;
status evaluated, and the plan updated to reflect progress. The updated&#13;
version of the CPM Implementation Plan would indicate actual vs&#13;
planned implementation and show adjustments made accordingly.&#13;
(b)   Quantitative Indicators&#13;
In each progress report and at each supervision, the indicators as listed in&#13;
Table 1 will be reviewed. The actual against planned data will be filled&#13;
out by the PMU, and will be discussed during supervision.&#13;
(c)   Qualitative Indicators&#13;
At each supervision, an evaluation will be undertaken by the supervision&#13;
team of progress regarding several qualitative indicators. The PMU will&#13;
mention, in its progress report, the status of these indicators, which will&#13;
then form the basis for the supervision discussion. For each indicators,&#13;
specific evidence of progress should be provided.  Table 2 shows&#13;
indicators and reporting format.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Book and Reading Development Project
            will aim at improving the quality of basic education by
            addressing critical factors affecting both the supply of,
            and demand of, textbooks. This will be achieved through
            establishing government policies, regulations, procedures,
            and practices related to school books, and making textbooks
            available in classrooms in sufficient quantity and in a
            sustainable way. Specifically, the project will support: 1)
            provision of textbooks in all required subjects, for all
            children in primary (SD) and junior secondary (SLTP)
            schools, public and private, giving priority attention to
            poor children; 2) procurement of the SLTP textbooks from
            private publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a transparent
            and rigorous evaluation and approval process, with the
            objective of achieving a high quality in the books; 3)
            greater involvement at the provincial level, through
            implementing the procurement process for SLTP textbooks at
            the Kanwil level; 4) giving help to teachers in how to use
            the books better in the classroom; and 5) the promotion of
            reading, especially for children.
