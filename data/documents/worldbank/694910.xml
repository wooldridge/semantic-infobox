STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          The Government of Kazakstan has requested World Bank assistance to finance a pilot&#13;
project that will design and test models for the implementation of the real estate registration system called&#13;
for under the Presidential Decree with the force of law, "On State Registration of Rights and Transactions&#13;
in Real Estate" of December 25, 1995 (henceforth, the Registration Law). The proposed project will&#13;
be implemented in 34 rayons in Almaty and Akmola oblasts and in Almaty city. The primary counterpart&#13;
for the project will be the Ministry of Justice. In addition, the State Land Committee and the Ministry&#13;
of Construction will play important roles in implementation. The end objective of the pilot project will&#13;
be to provide a reliable foundation for the implementation of a real estate registration system on a national&#13;
basis. Contingent upon successful implementation of the pilot project, the World Bank would be prepared&#13;
to continue to assist the Government in the implementation of a larger project with the objective of&#13;
expansion of the real estate registration system nationwide.&#13;
B. THE IMPORTANCE OF REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION SYSTEMS&#13;
1.2          Registration systems, which authoritatively record the ownership of rights in land and real&#13;
estate, are an essential component of the economic infrastructure of market economies. Registration&#13;
systems serve as the single source of official information about rights in land and real estate, representing&#13;
formal recognition and confirmation of these rights by government authorities. Registration systems also&#13;
serve as the official means by which transactions in land and real estate are recorded and legally validated.&#13;
By bringing clarity, certainty, and authority to rights and transactions in land and real estate, registration&#13;
systems greatly enhance security of tenure. This encourages efficient use of resources and stimulates&#13;
long-term investment.  A large number of rights in land and real estate have been established in&#13;
Kazakstan. As the process of economic reform moves forward, the number of rights, and of transactions&#13;
involving those rights, will increase tremendously.&#13;
C. PROPERTY RIGHTS IN LAND AND REAL ESTATE IN KAZAKSTAN&#13;
1.3          Kazakstan has in place a reliable legal basis defining property rights in land and real estate&#13;
and facilitating the exercise of those rights. The new Constitution and Part One of the Civil Code, both&#13;
introduced in 1995, provide the basic framework for real property rights in land and real estate.  A&#13;
number of important Presidential Decrees were issued in December 1995 which further clarified the&#13;
question of the extent and nature of property rights in land and real estate. On December 23, 1995 a&#13;
Presidential Decree with force of law "On the Mortgage of Real Estate" was issued elaborating upon the&#13;
general rules on pledges, as laid out in the Civil Code. It allows for the mortgage of all forms of real&#13;
estate with some limitations in cases where property is held in common ownership, and includes the&#13;
provision that special aspects of mortgage of land may be stipulated in separate legislation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.4          Another Presidential Decree with the force of law "On Land" was issued on December&#13;
22, 1995 (commonly referred to as the Land Code). It replaced a Land Code dating to the Soviet period&#13;
and consolidated treatment of land policy issues that bad been handled by a patchwork of statutes issued&#13;
since independence. The new Land Code provides for private as well as state ownership of land. A&#13;
private land owner is entitled, inter alia, to sell, lease, mortgage, or grant his property. The Code also&#13;
establishes use rights in state owned land that largely replicate the rights held by owners. Use rights can&#13;
be permanent, long-term (3-99 years) and short-term (less than 3 years). Individual holders of both&#13;
permanent and long-term use rights are entitled to sell, lease, mortgage, or grant their rights. These&#13;
provisions are sufficient for the development of markets in land in non-agricultural sectors of the&#13;
economy.&#13;
1.5          The Land Code is more restrictive of rights in agricultural land, however. Agricultural&#13;
land that is held in the personal household plots, and the garden and dacha plots can be privately owned.&#13;
All other agricultural land, including the land of private farmers, can be held in permanent use rights, but&#13;
not private ownership. However, land held collectively in use rights (i.e., the land of the large farming&#13;
collectives) cannot be alienated or mortgaged.&#13;
1.6          The Land Code allows for the allocation of land to those exiting the large farming&#13;
collectives as well as other people interested in starting private farms. For individuals exiting the farming&#13;
collectives, land is to be allocated from the collective in accordance with locally determined land share&#13;
norms. For individuals coming from outside of the large collectives, or for members of state agricultural&#13;
enterprises that are not subject to parcelization (e.g., research and breeding farms), land is provided from&#13;
a Land Reserve Fund, administered by local government.&#13;
1.7          At present there are an estimated 4.5 million land owners and users whose rights are&#13;
subject to registration. Furthermore, there are an estimated 2.2 million members of the large farming&#13;
collectives who are entitled to land share certificates. The majority of apartments and houses in Kazakstan&#13;
have been privatized. an Almaty, 99 percent of the apartments have been privatized.) These ownership&#13;
rights and subsequent transactions are also subject to registration. The level of transactions in real estate&#13;
is increasing in Almaty, with several hundred occurring each day. Roughly 2,000 medium sized&#13;
enterprises have been privatized. Approximately 11,000 small scale establishments have been sold by the&#13;
Government since the beginning of the mass privatization program early in 1994, representing two-thirds&#13;
of the total number of such objects.&#13;
D. EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.8          During the Soviet period, there was a major distinction made between treatment of land,&#13;
on the one hand, and treatment of improvements to land (buildings, structures, etc.), on the other. This&#13;
resulted in a complex set of agencies and institutions that are involved in collecting and maintaining&#13;
information on land and real estate.  Furthermore, the relatively low importance accorded to property&#13;
rights meant that the bulk of this information was technical, rather than legal, in orientation. Since the&#13;
early 1990's, recording of private rights in land and real estate has been underway. The system that&#13;
evolved in the last few years, however, lacks coherence and unity, and suffers from a lack of professional&#13;
legal oversight.&#13;
1.9           The Ministty of Justice. In many countries, the ministries of justice administer the real&#13;
estate registry. This is the approach adopted by Kazakstan in the recently issued Registration Law.&#13;
However, the Ministry of Justice has little experience in this area. It has undertaken the registration of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
legal entities, but has neither the experience nor the institutional capacity at present to undertake real&#13;
estate registration. The Ministry of Justice is represented at the oblast and rayon levels, and this system&#13;
will form the basis of new registration offices called for in the Registration Law. Existing staffing of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice at the regional and local levels is not adequate for registration and additional hiring&#13;
will be required.&#13;
1.10         The State Land Commitee (Goskomzem). The State Land Committee was established&#13;
in 1992, drawing largely from the Land Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. Its Chairman is a&#13;
Cabinet Minister. Goskomzem's functions include: (i) the administration and management of land&#13;
resources; (ii) the monitoring and control of land use; (iii) the protection of land; and (iv) the creation&#13;
of a nation-wide land cadastre. Goskomzem has been responsible for the registration of land use rights&#13;
and the issue of land use certificates (Land Acts). Since 1992, roughly 1.6 million Land Acts have been&#13;
issued and an additional 0.7 million are in preparation. This compares with a total of approximately 4.5&#13;
million land owners and users whose rights are subject to registration. The Land Acts contain important&#13;
legal information concerning a land parcel, including a description of its location, a survey depiction of&#13;
its boundaries, and identification of the user. However, for the purposes of the legal cadastre, there is&#13;
insufficient information on encumbrances and servitudes.&#13;
1.11         Goskomzem records the issue of Land Acts chronologically at the local level. This system&#13;
is inadequate from the point of view of information management. Continuation of this system over time&#13;
would result in difficulty in locating relevant legal information for a given parcel. The adoption of the&#13;
new Registration Law replaces the existing legal basis for land registration.&#13;
1.12         Goskomzem employs about 600 staff with headquarters in Almaty and branch offices in&#13;
each Oblast (Oblkomzem), City (Gorkomzem) and Rayon (Raykomzem). The staff are predominantly&#13;
surveyors and engineers. Branches are subject to dual subordination, reporting to their local government&#13;
administration as well as to headquarters in Almaty.&#13;
1.13         A subsidiary of Goskomzem, GosNPCzem (The State Scientific-Production Center for&#13;
Land), provides technical services for recording land parcels and for preparing State Acts. The&#13;
production of State Acts is partially computerized in some locations. GosNPCzem used to form part of&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture. Its main functions were: (i) to design and manage large-scale agricultural&#13;
development and improvement schemes; and (ii) to maintain the agricultural cadastre by means of which&#13;
Soviet agriculture was planned and managed. GosNPCzem employs approximately 2300 staff including&#13;
surveyors, engineers, agronomists, soil scientists and economists and maintains offices in each Oblast.&#13;
1.14         Another subsidiary of Goskomzem is the State Institute for Agricultural Aerophotogeodetic&#13;
Surveys (GISKhAGI). GISKhAGI was established in 1936 as part of the Ministry of Agriculture to&#13;
produce mapping for the agricultural cadastre. In 1992, it was transferred to Goskomzem and has since&#13;
undertaken some mapping of non-agricultural areas. The agricultural cadastre parcel maps have been&#13;
produced in the form of line maps and photoplans at scales from 1:10,000 to 1:50,000. GISKhAGI also&#13;
produces large scale mapping at 1:5,000 and larger in urban and peri-urban areas.&#13;
1.15         As part of a recent Government reorganization, the Main Administration for Geography&#13;
and Cartography (Kazgeodesia) has been merged into Goskomzem. Goskmomzem thereby became the&#13;
primary civilian mapping agency in the country. As a result of this merger, its mandate was expanded&#13;
to include: (i) providing geodetic and topographic survey and mapping services; (ii) international boundary&#13;
demarcation; and (iii) the licensing of other agencies to undertake surveys and mapping works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Kazgeodesia was traditionally responsible for the production of topographic base-mapping at scales&#13;
ranging from 1:500 to 1:100,000 for the whole territory of Kazakstan, together with small scale mapping&#13;
and other thematic maps.&#13;
1.16          The Ministry of Construction. The Ministry of Construction is the focal point within the&#13;
Government for information on buildings. It has offices in each oblast. Until recently, the Ministry of&#13;
Construction administered the offices of the Bureau of Technical Inventory (see below). In recent years&#13;
this administrative subordination has been broken. The Ministry of Construction continues to have&#13;
oversight responsibility for the Rayon and City Architect's Offices, which exist in the largest cities and&#13;
in each oblast in Kazakstan.&#13;
1.17          Rayon and City Architect's Offices. The City Architect's Offices produce large scale&#13;
(1:500 to 1:2,000) maps for architectural and engineering construction purposes. Coverage is restricted&#13;
to urban areas and is often based on mapping produced by Kazgeodesia. The Rayon or City Architect&#13;
is responsible for planning the physical infrastructure, for coordinating development activity, for&#13;
approving construction plans and for monitoring construction. Following construction, the Rayon or City&#13;
Architect's Office surveys the site and adds the structure/facility to their maps. Since the map updating&#13;
process is so closely linked to the approval process, the maps are theoretically current.&#13;
1.18          The Almaty City Architect's Office employs approximately 10 surveyors involved in&#13;
updating the 1:2,000 scale maps and 4 devoted to the 1:500 scale series. In Almaty the City Architects&#13;
Office has converted approximately 30 percent of the 1:2,000 scale maps to digital form utilizing&#13;
AutoCAD.&#13;
1.19          The Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs). BTI offices exist in most cities and large&#13;
towns. The BTIs have for many years acted as the organization responsible for recording the occupation&#13;
and tenure rights of buildings, in particular apartments and houses. As a result, BTIs have amassed&#13;
detailed records of the location, construction, facilities, services and equipment of urban buildings. Until&#13;
recently, the BTIs were under the joint jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction and the local&#13;
government administration. Since 1993, the BTIs have undergone administrative changes. Most are no&#13;
longer subordinate to the Ministry of Construction and in many large cities have been privatized.&#13;
Increasingly their orientation is focused on real estate appraisal. Most have changed their titles to include&#13;
the term "Real Estate Appraisal Board" or "Real Estate Appraisal and Registration Board".&#13;
1.20          BTI's records form the basis for the privatization of dwellings; a prospective owner is able&#13;
to obtain from BTI evidence of his/her prior occupation, as a preliminary step to an application for&#13;
privatization. The culmination of the privatization process is the issue of a Privatization Act. The&#13;
Privatization Act includes technical information (the "Technical Passport") describing the property and&#13;
its location, as well as information on the owner/user. In distinction from the State Acts for land, the&#13;
Privatization Acts for dwellings in some parts of the country include reliable information on&#13;
encumbrances. BTIs have also acted as the registration authority for transactions in buildings. A&#13;
transaction is effected by transferring a Privatization Act from vendor to purchaser, and registering the&#13;
transfer at the local BTI. BTIs registration records are keyed to its own numbering system for buildings,&#13;
which is inconsistent with a parcel based identification system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.21          The State Propery Committee (Goskomimuschestvo). The State Property Committee is&#13;
responsible for the privatization of state-owned enterprises. It prepares and issues "Privatization Acts"&#13;
for such transactions. The Ministry of Justice has responsibility for registering the privatized enterprises.&#13;
1.22          Public Notaries. The Public Notaries are employed by the State and report to the&#13;
Ministry of Justice. There is a minimum of one Notary office per rayon. Notaries act as intermediaries&#13;
between buyer and seller for real estate and land. Notaries prepare standard contracts for the sale and&#13;
transfer of property. As a condition of the preparation of such documents the Notary verifies that all&#13;
supplementary documents are properly constituted, that the necessary taxes and fees have been paid to the&#13;
appropriate authorities, and that the current obligations associated with the rights to be transferred have&#13;
been met. The contract of sale is executed by the parties and certified by the Notary.&#13;
1.23          Local Government Administration. Local administrations have a pivotal role in the&#13;
allocation of land and other real estate rights, and in the control of land use within their boundaries. They&#13;
combine the functions of: (i) disposing of and qualifying the rights in terms of the uses to be permitted;&#13;
(ii) controlling construction through the architecture and construction committees; (iii) registering the&#13;
ownership, occupation and value of buildings through BTI; and (iv) registering the ownership of land&#13;
use rights through the local Land Committee office.&#13;
E. PRINCIPLES OF REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION&#13;
1.24          The experience of countries which have established successful real estate registers suggests&#13;
that certain principles should be incorporated:&#13;
1.25          Principle 1: Unification. A real estate register must be unified in the sense that it must&#13;
record the rights to all land, whether urban or rural, agricultural or industrial, as well as rights to all real&#13;
estate, including rights in land parcels which are delineated by horizontal as opposed to vertical&#13;
boundaries, as in the case of apartment buildings.&#13;
1.26          Principle 2: Impartial and Independent. A real estate register is maintained by the State&#13;
for the benefit of those who own rights in land or who use the register to identify owners as a means of&#13;
ensuring certainty in transactions. As a guardian of public rights, the registry must be separated from the&#13;
executive functions of government. Managers of the register make no decisions about who is granted land&#13;
rights or who transacts them nor how land use is controlled. This role distinguishes the register from other&#13;
forms of land record which may be designed to enable the State to fulfil its responsibilities such as master&#13;
planning or tax collection.&#13;
1.27          Principle 3: Governed by Law. The registry should be established by a law which&#13;
defines the powers and responsibilities of its managers. The agency has no power to refuse registration&#13;
of a lawfully acquired right to land.&#13;
1.28          Principle 4: State Indemnity. The legal effect from the moment of registration should&#13;
be to grant the State's guarantee of the validity of the title registered, against any claim to the contrary.&#13;
Thus the State indemnifies the registered owner against such claims.&#13;
1.29          Principle 5: Parcel-Based. The unit of registration should be the land parcel as identified&#13;
by a unique index number. The land parcel, delineated by its vertical boundaries, is unique and cannot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
be changed (although it may be sub-divided). In the case of buildings in multiple ownership a parcel may&#13;
be delineated by horizontal boundaries i.e., floors in the building. The parcel-based unit of registration&#13;
is adopted as the key because it is finite and unchanging, whereas names of owners of rights change over&#13;
time.&#13;
1.30          Principle 6: Coordination with Physical Cadastres. Coordination between the real estate&#13;
register (the legal cadastre) and the cadastre for land and buildings must be well defined for the&#13;
registration system to function efficiently. This coordination should include delineation of responsibilities&#13;
for information collection and maintenance so as to reduce overlap and duplication, and reliable channels&#13;
for the flow of information between the legal and physical cadastres.&#13;
1.31          Principle 7: Adjudication and Demarcation. The register should be compiled by a&#13;
process known as 'Adjudication'. By means of this process all rights in land, whether statutory or&#13;
customary, are finally and authoritatively determined by due process of law, prior to registration.&#13;
Adjudication does not alter the rights but simply identifies and demarcates the location, nature, extent and&#13;
ownership of rights in each parcel. Adjudication must include a procedure for appeals.&#13;
1.32          Principle 8: Register Priority. For the purposes of proving good title, it is the entry in&#13;
the register which is the official proof not the certificate issued to the holder of the rights. This principle&#13;
ties in with Principle 4 because the State is unable to prevent fraudulent use, alteration or counterfeiting&#13;
of certificates.&#13;
1.33          Principle 9: Adverse Claims. The system should incorporate provisions for the filing&#13;
of adverse claims and the rapid resolution for such claims.&#13;
1.34          Principle 10: Open to the Public. The register should be open and accessible to the&#13;
public. This enables the owners of rights to be clearly identified for example, by those wishing to deal&#13;
in rights.&#13;
F. THE NEW REGISTRATION SYSTEM&#13;
1.35          The Registration Law addresses nearly all of the principles laid out above. It establishes&#13;
a system for the unified registration of rights in land and real estate. It creates a Registration Body as&#13;
part of the Ministry of Justice and defines the concept of the Legal Cadastre, which represents the&#13;
information base for the registration system. The Law further clarifies the rights which are subject to&#13;
registration and the general procedures to be followed in registering those rights. The Law calls for a&#13;
parcel based system of managing information. It establishes the principle of priority and addresses the&#13;
question of adverse claims. Further, it provides for public access to information in the registry and&#13;
delineates the bases for suspending or refusing registration.&#13;
1.36          The Registration Law leaves open a number of important questions about the practical&#13;
functioning of the registration system. Foremost among these is the linkage with the land and buildings&#13;
cadastres and the way in which introduction of the new system is coordinated with the existing&#13;
arrangements for registration of rights in real property (the Land Acts for land issued by Goskomzem and&#13;
the Privatization Acts issued by the BTIs). The Registration Law leaves the format of the registration&#13;
book and the registration forms for individual properties (the registration sheets) undefined.  For the&#13;
system to operate effectively, standard forms for various types of transactions (sale, lease, mortgage,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inheritance, etc.) need to be defined and utilized. Procedures for handling documents from the time they&#13;
enter the registration offices until they are either returned to the client or filed in the legal cadastre need&#13;
to be defined. The Registration Law also leaves undefined the system of fees for service and fees&#13;
allocation, and procedures for assignment of cadastral numbers to land parcels.&#13;
1.37         Since issuing the Registration Law in December, the Government has undertaken work&#13;
to address the missing elements of the system. An inter-agency Working Group for implementation of&#13;
the Registration Law was established by then Deputy Prime Minister Shaikenov on March 4, 1996. The&#13;
Working Group is composed of representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the State Land Committee, the&#13;
Ministry of Construction, and the BTI offices for both the city and oblast of Almaty. Its mandate is to&#13;
address the issues of coordination of functions and successful implementation of the system. The last&#13;
Preparation Mission on this project met intensively with representatives of the Working Group to solidify&#13;
common positions and understandings on inter-agency cooperation and coordination. On April 12, 1996&#13;
the Government issued a formal Agreement signed by the Ministry of Justice, the State Land Committee,&#13;
and the Ministry of Construction "On Inter-Agency Cooperation" which includes a commitment on the&#13;
part of all signatories to work toward the successful implementation of the Registration Law. In&#13;
particular, it states that the Land Committee offices, the BTIs, and the City Architects' Offices will&#13;
provide necessary information on land parcels and buildings for the efficient functioning of the legal&#13;
cadastre (Annex A). During the Appraisal Mission, the arrangements for inter-agency cooperation were&#13;
further elaborated with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the State Land Committee, and the&#13;
Ministry of Construction. It was agreed that these arrangements would be formally established in a&#13;
Government Resolution on registration procedures. This Resolution was issued on February 20, 1997.&#13;
1.38         The Bank has provided the Government with sample registration sheets and books from&#13;
other countries. From this and other sources, the Government is now approaching closure on the format&#13;
for these items in Kazakstan. The Government has also come to closure on the system of assigning&#13;
cadastral numbers to land parcels. Issuing official documents defining the format for the registration&#13;
sheets and book, document handling procedures, and inter-agency cooperation arrangements will provide&#13;
an adequate basis to initiate project implementation, with the pilot functioning to further elaborate&#13;
operational aspects of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1           The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as discussed by the Board&#13;
of Directors during the presentation of the Technical Assistance Loan (3642-KZ) on August 3, 1993. The&#13;
Bank's strategy to assist the Government of Kazakstan is founded on four key pillars to provide support&#13;
for: (i) macroeconomic stabilization and price reform; (ii) transformation of the economy to a competitive,&#13;
market-based system through privatization of state enterprises and the encouragement of competition from&#13;
new market participants; (iii) strengthened capacity for social protection; and (iv) rehabilitation and&#13;
improved management capacity for public infrastructure. The proposed project fits directly into this&#13;
strategy. It will provide a system to reliably record emerging private rights in land and real estate,&#13;
thereby facilitating transactions in those rights including sale, lease, mortgage, and grant. Security of&#13;
tenure resulting from the system will in turn encourage investment in land, enterprises and other property.&#13;
The proposed project will provide the basis for testing implementation of an important piece of the public&#13;
infrastructure necessary for a market-based economy. Based on successful implementation of the pilot&#13;
project, a fuller project would be prepared for implementation of the registration system on a nation-wide&#13;
basis.&#13;
2.2           The Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) for Kazakstan, inter alia, addressed the issue of&#13;
land market development. The Letter of Economic Reform Policies contained provisions for the&#13;
clarification of land policies through the preparation of a new draft Land Code, and fostering efficient and&#13;
equitable real estate markets and alleviating potential conflicts over land rights through the detailed&#13;
definition of procedures for registration of real estate. Development of land reform, and in particular,&#13;
the development of the land cadastre and the system of registration are featured in the Government's&#13;
Program of Actions for Deepening the Economic Reforms during 1996-98. Subsequent to the first tranche&#13;
of the SAL, a Land Code and Registration Law have been issued. The Government now requires&#13;
assistance in moving beyond this legislative foundation in elaborating and implementing a sound real estate&#13;
registration system.&#13;
2.3           The Agricultural Sector Review (ASR) identified the lack of a land registration system&#13;
as one of the binding constraints to the transformation of the sector to a market-based orientation. The&#13;
ASR argued that the absence of an effective registration system for both land and buildings is constraining&#13;
privatization and development. An Agriculture Privatization Support Project is now in preparation which&#13;
will focus on the process of structural change in farm management with the goal of facilitating the&#13;
emergence of more efficient farms. A critical aspect of the farm restructuring process will be the&#13;
establishment of private rights in the land and property of the existing large collective farms. For the&#13;
farm restructuring process to move forward effectively, a reliable system for registering these newly&#13;
emerging rights will be essential.&#13;
2.4           The World Bank has recently approved US$180 million Financial Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(FSAL). One part of the financial sector program that the FSAL addresses is strengthening the&#13;
framework for secured lending. Important in this regard is a reliable system for determining rights in real&#13;
property. The proposed project will provide the basis for the satisfaction of these requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

m. BANK EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS&#13;
A. EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.1          The Bank's limited experience in financing land titling and registration is based mainly&#13;
on components of large rural or agricultural development projects, or free-standing land projects. Since&#13;
1980, 17 PCRs or PPARs have been prepared for projects with land as a component and two PCRs for&#13;
free-standing land projects. The two land projects are the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement&#13;
Project for Brazil (Ln. No. 2593-BR) and the Land Titling Project for Thailand (Ln. No. 2440-TH). A&#13;
recent OED report entitled The World Bank's Experience with Rural Land 7itling (No. 1992-35, March&#13;
1992) has also summarized Bank experience and lessons in land registration.&#13;
3.2          Experience has been mixed. In the majority of projects, performance has fallen short of&#13;
targets. In some cases, cost overruns for land titling have been large. Data from most rural and&#13;
agricultural development projects in particular, show considerable cost overruns. Costs per land parcel&#13;
adjudicated in Brazil were nearly twice the estimates made during appraisal. On the other hand, cost per&#13;
parcel adjudicated in Thailand was lower than estimated. Mapping targets were generally met with less&#13;
of a tendency for cost overruns. However, delays in their implementation contributed to delays in titling.&#13;
3.3          The factors which have contributed to poor performance can be traced to inappropriate&#13;
or ambitious design and over-optimistic assumptions about implementation. According to OED, the four&#13;
main reasons for poor performance of land titling projects are: (i) lack of political support; (ii) conflicting&#13;
bureaucratic priorities and/or infighting; (iii) lack of institutional capacity or unwillingness to commit&#13;
adequate resources; and (iv) underestimation of complexity and/or costs, or other design weaknesses. A&#13;
large number of Bank projects with land titling components involved redistribution of existing land rights.&#13;
In most cases this proved to be a formidable barrier to progress in project implementation, particularly&#13;
in economies where agrarian interests were strong.&#13;
3.4          In a majority of projects, existing infrastructure to undertake land titling activities was&#13;
weak. Most countries lacked adequate surveying capabilities (both skills and facilities), and were typically&#13;
unable to overcome these shortcomings in an effective and timely manner. The projects in Brazil and&#13;
Thailand point to the need to plan carefully for the introduction and assimilation of new mapping and&#13;
survey technologies. This challenge was met very successfully in the case of Thailand, where training and&#13;
technical assistance were incorporated and where the geographical scale matched the numbers of trained&#13;
staff. In the case of Brazil, the approach to modernize the cadastral database was not adequately discussed&#13;
with, or understood by, the client prior to implementation.&#13;
3.5          The lack of adequate incentives, bonuses, or career development prospects for staff is&#13;
cited as a serious weakness. In the case of Thailand, the implementing agency was unable to retain many&#13;
of the trained staff who left for positions elsewhere in the government or joined the private sector. In a&#13;
number of countries, management links between agencies at central government level and regional and&#13;
district offices were too weak to coordinate implementation. In extreme cases, district registration offices&#13;
were not even established during the life of the project. Lack of training at regional and district levels also&#13;
contributed to poor performance.&#13;
3.6          The Brazil project suffered from an ineffective coordination unit due to: (i) repeated&#13;
changes in structure and staffing; (ii) insufficient authority to supervise implementation; (iii) lack of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
counterpart funds for field supervision; and (iv) an inability to retain staff with the necessary skills. While&#13;
such problems have been less severe in Thailand, the implementing agency lacked a management structure&#13;
adequate to oversee activities at the provincial level. Delays in procurement lead to overall delays in titling&#13;
and registration.&#13;
B. LESSONS&#13;
3.7           Land titling and registration projects must incorporate the following key elements: (i) a&#13;
single agency must have overall responsibility for implementation with clear and well-functioning&#13;
management links at all levels; (ii) implementation units must be adequately staffed, funded and trained;&#13;
(iii) implementation units must be empowered by law to coordinate project activities; (iv) projects should&#13;
be designed on the basis of existing human skills and institutional arrangements so as to be able to&#13;
assimilate technological advances; and, (v) capabilities need to be further enhanced through institutional&#13;
development including training and technical assistance.&#13;
3.8           Projects which have focused on the registration of existing rights have proved much more&#13;
successful than those addressing a reallocation of rights. More crucially, a project must be consistent with&#13;
a government's own plans to address land use questions. This was considered to be a critical factor in the&#13;
success of the Thailand project.&#13;
3.9           Land titling and registration costs can greatly exceed expectations where due attention is&#13;
not paid to procedures for adjudication, demarcation, survey and dispute settlement. Maximum use of&#13;
photogrammetric methods, as opposed to field work for existing parcels, has also proved to be&#13;
economically expedient. It is important that relevant government policies in these areas be reviewed and&#13;
addressed during project preparation.&#13;
3.10          Due to the specialized nature of equipment for such projects, careful attention must be&#13;
given to preparation of bid documents and bid evaluation procedures. Projects should be designed to&#13;
reflect realistic possibilities for coordinating aerial photography, map production, adjudication, registration&#13;
and the issue of title certificates. The scale of the project should be commensurate with the ability of the&#13;
borrower to staff district and provincial offices with trained personnel, carry out registration activity and&#13;
provide adequate resources. Finally, staff involved in project supervision and implementation must have&#13;
appropriate incentives, including salary bonuses, and career advancement opportunities.&#13;
C. LESSONS IN THE FSU&#13;
3.11          The Bank has undertaken similar projects in a number of countries in the former Soviet&#13;
Union (FSU). The LARIS project for Russia is the first Bank project which deals with land registration&#13;
in the FSU. This project was prepared during 1993/1994 and is now in implementation. Preparation is&#13;
underway for a land registration project in Ukraine. Experience from these projects shows that the lack&#13;
of a firm legal basis, the existence of strong inter-agency rivalries for control of registration, and the lack&#13;
of policy consensus on the goal of markets in land and real estate complicate project development.&#13;
3.12          There are many parallels among Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakstan in terms of the starting&#13;
point of a Soviet land tenure framework, the early developments in land law before the break up of the&#13;
USSR and the origins and nature of the institutions now involved in land administration and management.&#13;
Kazakstan shares with Russia its economic inheritance and the present state of its economy, particularly&#13;
in the agricultural sector, is equally problematic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
3.13         Kazakstan, however, now has a reliable legislative base and is the first country in the&#13;
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) with a real estate registration law. Strong efforts are being&#13;
made within Government to address the relevant interests of all involved agencies in the development of&#13;
the new registration system and to adopt pragmatic approaches to the process of land reform and real&#13;
estate market development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1           The objective of the Real Estate Registration Pilot Project will be to support, on a pilot&#13;
basis, the Borrower's effort to establish a national registration system of real estate rights and transactions&#13;
called for under the Presidential Decree with the force of law, "On State Registration of Rights and&#13;
Transactions in Real Estate" of December 25, 1995 (Registration Law) that would lead to increased&#13;
security for rights to land and real estate, facilitate transactions in land and real estate, and promote the&#13;
development of credit systems (see Annex B for a copy of the Registration Law). The project will also&#13;
test the use of digital mapping in support of the registration system, current and longer-term requirements&#13;
for map production and revision. Successful implementation of the Pilot Project will increase security&#13;
of tenure in land and real estate, resulting in a higher level of investment and mortgaging. It will improve&#13;
the functioning of sales and lease markets and government administration of real estate by providing&#13;
information for the formulation of real estate development policies and real estate appraisal. Lastly, it&#13;
will provide the basis for expansion of the real estate registration system to a national basis. Critical&#13;
indicators for the success of the pilot project will be the level of sales, lease, mortgage and other&#13;
transactions handled by the registration system.&#13;
B. PROJECT CONCEPT&#13;
4.2           The tasks facing the Government following the adoption of the Registration Law are two-&#13;
fold: (i) physically set up the registration offices under the Ministry of Justice and build implementation&#13;
capacity within the Ministry of Justice; and (ii) elaborate procedures for the functioning of the registration&#13;
system including a detailed plan for information sharing with other agencies and a delineation of the&#13;
longer-term role of these agencies in the functioning of the registration system.&#13;
4.3           The Government has expressed its interest in seeking low cost, pragmatic approaches to&#13;
carrying out this work. Given the obstacles faced in establishing the new registration offices, the need&#13;
to coordinate the cooperation of a number of agencies that will be involved in supporting the functioning&#13;
of the registration system, and the need to begin tackling this task in the nearest future, the Government&#13;
and the Bank have agreed to carry out this work on a pilot basis, which will allow for the testing and&#13;
elaboration of procedures and choice of technology prior to implementation of a registration system on&#13;
a broad basis. To avoid duplication of efforts, the Government has chosen to transfer existing BTI offices&#13;
to the Ministry of Justice to serve as the backbone of the new registration offices. The time devoted to&#13;
the pilot project can also be put to good use in assessing the existing information base and institutional&#13;
capacities nationwide.&#13;
4.4           Preparation Missions have found that a good deal of information required to implement&#13;
the registration system already exists in some parts of the country. This allows for a much lower-cost&#13;
approach than would be necessary if implementation were to begin from scratch. Existing maps, though&#13;
not always current or of the highest quality, were found to be adequate for the purposes of establishing&#13;
the registration system. The quality of maps in Almaty City were particularly good. There the City&#13;
Architect's Office has maintained working maps on the scales of 1:500 and 1:2000. Other information&#13;
exists on properties (parcel surveys, building floor plans), holders of rights, and the rights themselves&#13;
(although the information on third party rights is incomplete and scattered).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
4.5           The pilot project concept is to make maximum use of this existing information. Along&#13;
with the transfer of BTI offices to the Ministry of Justice, this means incorporating the offices of the State&#13;
Land Committee and the City and Rayon Architect's Offices into start up of the system. A cost-effective&#13;
approach also implies that working relations among these agencies be defined for long-run maintenance&#13;
and operation of the system.&#13;
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
4.6           The project will be implemented in all rayons in Akmola Oblast, Almaty Oblast, and&#13;
Almaty City. The project will establish the registration offices called for under the Registration Law at&#13;
the rayon and oblast levels and provide a reliable system for their effective functioning. As part of the&#13;
project, the Real Estate Registration Department of the Ministry of Justice will be established at the&#13;
Republic level. The project will be implemented over two years. The rayon level offices, where&#13;
registration of rights will take place, are scheduled to begin functioning in the second quarter of 1997,&#13;
initially on the basis of paper technology. During the first quarter of 1998, these offices will be converted&#13;
to automated technology. During the course of 1998, assessment of the automated system will be made.&#13;
The project will consist of three components: (i) institution building; (ii) establishment of the registration&#13;
system; and (iii) map production.&#13;
4.7           The Government has obtained a US$1.5 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
advance loan to complete preparation and prepare for implementation of the project. These funds are&#13;
being used to establish and make operational the Project Implementation Unit, to recruit consultants, to&#13;
initiate training programs, and to ready premises for the new registration offices of the Ministry of Justice&#13;
at the rayon and oblast levels.&#13;
1. Institution Building&#13;
4.8           This component will consist of: (i) the Project Implementation Unit; (ii) technical&#13;
assistance in elaborating and testing aspects of the registration system; and (iii) the implementation of&#13;
training programs.&#13;
The Project Implementation Unit&#13;
4.9           The PIU will be attached to the Ministry of Justice and report to the Minister. The PIU&#13;
will consist of a head, a project implementation assistant, a specialist in information technology, a&#13;
specialist in land cadastre matters, a specialist in building cadastre matters, a lawyer, a specialist in&#13;
accounting and procurement, a logistics expert, a translator, and secretary. The specialist in information&#13;
technology will head the Technology Oversight Group, a sub-unit of the PIU, with an additional staff of&#13;
five individuals responsible for all information technology aspects of the project. (See Annex C for Terms&#13;
of Reference for the PIU.) The position of Head of the PIU will be staffed by the Ministry of Justice,&#13;
the positions for specialists in land cadastre and information technology will be staffed by the State Land&#13;
Committee, and the position of buildings cadastre specialist will be staffed by the Ministry of&#13;
Construction. Space within the Ministry of Justice has been allocated as temporary premises for the PIU.&#13;
All appointments to the PIU will have the concurrence of the World Bank. Government Order No. 453-r&#13;
of September 25, 1996 signed by the Prime Minister established the PIU, including appointment of the&#13;
PIU Head and other core staff. Under the negotiated Loan Agreement, the Government agreed to&#13;
maintain the PIU until completion of the Project, and ensure that the PIU functions at all times in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
accordance with procedures, under terms of reference, and with staff and budgetary resources necessary&#13;
to meet the objectives of the Project and satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, particular&#13;
agreement was reached on staffing of the PIU, that staff assigned to the PIU are to work full-time on&#13;
project implementation, and that the PIU will obtain adequate premises by March 1, 1997. Such premises&#13;
have been allocated.&#13;
4.10          The PIU will be responsible for overall project implementation and adherence to the&#13;
project implementation plan. In particular, it will: (i) monitor progress by Government agencies in&#13;
preparing necessary documents for the project; (ii) manage preparatory work on bidding documents for&#13;
the procurement of goods and services for the Project; (iii) handle logistical arrangements for consultants&#13;
hired for the Project; (iv) oversee the design and implementation of training programs and a national&#13;
training center; (v) set up accounting and reporting mechanisms for use in the Project; (vi) serve as a&#13;
clearinghouse for identifying and resolving inter-agency arrangements and issues associated with the&#13;
Project; and (vii) other preparation functions as necessary.&#13;
4.11          The Technology Oversight Group (TOG) will be established as a sub-unit of the PIU and&#13;
be responsible for: (i) reviewing the training programs in automated technology and insuring that&#13;
operational staff in fact have acquired the necessary skills; (ii) monitoring progress in preparation of the&#13;
user-interface software; (iii) participating in the evaluation of tenders for computer equipment; (iv)&#13;
insuring adequate information linkages among the participating agencies at the rayon and oblast levels;&#13;
(v) monitoring delivery and installation of automated systems (delivery and installation will be the&#13;
responsibility of the supplier under the anticipated contract); and (vi) monitoring the effectiveness of&#13;
technological approaches in the implementation of the pilot, with the goal of making recommendations&#13;
for eventual roll-out of the registration system nationwide. The Technology Oversight Group will be&#13;
drawn from local consultants and Government staff and be composed of five staff in addition to the TOG&#13;
Head. During negotiations agreement was reached on these terms of reference and staffing requirements&#13;
for the TOG.&#13;
4.12          In preparation of bidding documents for goods, the PIU was supported by consultants&#13;
financed under Italian Trust Funds. Those consultants were in Kazakstan from late September to mid-&#13;
November to assist in completion of commercial portions of the bidding documents for goods to be&#13;
procured under ICB and to provide background in the conduct of procurement under Shopping Procedures&#13;
financed out of the PPF. The TOG is responsible for the preparation of technical specifications, including&#13;
recruitment of additional consultants to complete this work.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
4.13          The Government's capacity to implement the project will be enhanced by a consultant&#13;
team with broad experience in the area of registration and real estate. 7he contract for the general&#13;
consultant team was signed in January as a condition of effectiveness. The team is headed by an expert&#13;
in real estate registration systems and includes a specialist in real estate markets, a lawyer with expertise&#13;
in real estate registration, and a land cadastre and information technology specialist (Annex D provides&#13;
Terms of Reference for the core consultant team). The consultant team will be responsible for overseeing&#13;
with the Government the implementation of the pilot project at the rayon level. It will be responsible for&#13;
proposing procedural and operational approaches to be tested, and will participate with Government in&#13;
monitoring and revising those procedures. The team will provide foreign country experience on the&#13;
interaction of the legal and land/buildings cadastres, provision of services to clients and overall system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
administration and management. Consultant input will be concentrated during the start-up of the paper-&#13;
based system and during conversion to the automated system.&#13;
4.14          The consultant team will cooperate with local consultants and the Government in&#13;
overseeing the development of the user-interface software for the automated registration system. The&#13;
Head of the consultant team will report to the Head of the PIU.&#13;
4.15          Local consultants will be hired in a broad number of areas. First, the Technical Oversight&#13;
Group with staff of five will be established under the Project Unit to oversee all aspects of automation&#13;
technology. Other local consultants will be hired by the PIU, as necessary, to assist in project&#13;
implementation. Kazakstani legal consultants will assist in completion of necessary documents in support&#13;
of the Registration Law. Consultants will also be hired to complete preparation of bidding documents for&#13;
goods, and a Kazakstani firm will prepare the applied software for the automated system.&#13;
Trining Programs&#13;
4.16          Training under the Project will focus on domestic training with input from expatriates&#13;
concentrated in the early phase of project implementation. There will be three tracks of training. (Terms&#13;
of reference for the training programs are provided in Annex E.) One will focus on registrars at the&#13;
rayon level and on individuals with legal training at the oblast and Republican levels and address legal&#13;
and administrative aspects of the new registration system. The first part of this program will focus on&#13;
the existing legislative basis for real estate registration in Kazakstan. The second part of the program will&#13;
focus on situations and problems that will be encountered in running the registration system, as&#13;
demonstrated by the experience of other countries. This part of the program will draw upon the expertise&#13;
of foreign consultants in identifying and addressing those issues which have proven to be common&#13;
problems or complications in running real estate registration systems. This training will also cover best&#13;
practices in administration of real estate registration systems. Approximately 55 staff will be trained&#13;
under this program.&#13;
4.17          The second track will focus on the operational staff, primarily at the rayon level, and be&#13;
oriented to office procedures, client interaction, data base management, etc. but also provide exposure&#13;
to the legal issues and legal implications of a registration system. Operational staff of the Land Committee&#13;
and rayon/city architects' offices will also participate. This training program will also be split into two&#13;
parts, with the first half dealing with the existing legislative basis in Kazakstan and the second half&#13;
drawing upon the experience from other countries. Approximately 380 staff will receive training under&#13;
this program.&#13;
4.18          The third track will provide training in computer software. All staff inputing or accessing&#13;
data from the automated system will receive training in the operating system software (approximately 300&#13;
staff). In addition, roughly 50 staff responsible for system maintenance at the rayon, oblast, and&#13;
Republican level will receive in-depth training in the operating and data base management software&#13;
included in the system. A further 8 staff in the Map Digitization Center will receive in-depth training in&#13;
the use of GIS software.&#13;
4.19          A training center will be established in Almaty to conduct the first track of training and&#13;
much of the second and third tracks. Facilities will be located in Akmola to provide additional training&#13;
in the second and third tracks. In mid-1998, seminars will be conducted for staff involved in the project&#13;
summarizing experience and results of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
2. Establishment of the Registration System&#13;
4.20          This component will establish the registration offices of the Ministry of Justice. It will&#13;
also define linkages between those offices and the offices of the State Land Committee and the Ministry&#13;
of Construction in the efficient functioning of the new registration system. The component will entail&#13;
locating premises and staff for the new registration offices, elaborating procedures for the entry of&#13;
information into the registry (legal cadastre) and maintenance of this information as well as necessary&#13;
information in the land and buildings cadastres, elaboration of office procedures and standard forms for&#13;
the registration offices; and elaboration and testing of database management practices.&#13;
Establishment of Registration Offices&#13;
4.21          The project will focus on establishing registration offices at the rayon and oblast levels&#13;
within Almaty and Akmola oblasts, and Almaty city. Offices will be established in a total of 34 rayons,&#13;
in both oblasts and an oblast level office in Almaty city on the basis of existing BTI offices. In addition,&#13;
the project will finance establishment of the Registration Division of the Ministry of Justice at the&#13;
Republican level. Under this component, the loan will finance furniture and equipment for the operation&#13;
of both a paper-based and automated registration system (in addition to the training and technical&#13;
assistance provided under the Institution Building component). The automation equipment will consist&#13;
of basic local area networks (desk-top computers and file servers), software (operating, data-base&#13;
management, and user-interface), printers, and copying machines. The Government will provide&#13;
financing of staff and premises.&#13;
4.22          The first group of approximately 10 rayon registration offices are scheduled to begin&#13;
operation in April, 1997. These will be followed by the remaining rayon offices in May and June.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the implementation of an information campaign managed&#13;
by the Ministry of Justice that will include television, radio, and newspapers to inform the public of the&#13;
opening of the rayon registration offices, the new registration procedures and the advantages inherent in&#13;
the new unified system. The rayon level will be the focus of registration activity. Though volumes&#13;
obviously will vary from rayon to rayon, experience in the FSU has shown that a rayon containing&#13;
approximately 20,000 identifiable real estate properties will generate from 30 to 50 real estate related&#13;
events requiring interaction with the registration system per business day. The typical rayon staffing&#13;
configuration will include a chief registrar (lawyer), a secretary, and 4 clerical staff for data entry and&#13;
serving the public. In the first phase of the pilot project these offices will begin functioning using paper&#13;
technology. This will allow for earlier implementation of the system and for testing procedures and&#13;
information formats prior to initiating automation.&#13;
4.23          To begin implementation of the paper-based system will require adoption of supporting&#13;
documents to the Registration Law including the format of the registration list and registration book, and&#13;
elaboration of general procedures to be followed including a schedule of fees for service and standard&#13;
forms for the following transactions; sale, lease, sale of lease or sub-lease, mortgage, sale or transfer of&#13;
mortgage, sale of a land share, transfer by inheritance, termination of a mortgage, termination of a lease,&#13;
agreement on servitude or other limitation, termination of agreement on servitude or other limitation,&#13;
power of attorney, adverse claims, and splitting of a land parcel (Block B in the Implementation Plan--&#13;
Supporting Documents).  These procedural and operational documents will be subject to further&#13;
elaboration and revision during implementation of the pilot project. In addition, steps have been taken&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
to ensure the availability of index maps in the corresponding rayon offices of the land committee (Block&#13;
J in the Implementation Plan--Paper Maps).&#13;
4.24          To allow the new rayon registration offices to perform their functions effectively, working&#13;
linkages will be established with rayon land committee offices and rayon/city architect's offices. The&#13;
roles of the involved agencies will be guided by the Registration Law and other laws and statutes of&#13;
Kazakstan. The Registration Law states that registration of rights is initiated by the holder of those rights.&#13;
This will result in sporadic registration of properties. Information on already existing land rights will&#13;
remain at its current location (the Land Committees). When a new right is established through, say, a&#13;
sale, lease, or mortgage, information on the property in question will be transferred to the registration&#13;
offices of the Ministry of Justice. Land Acts will continue to be issued by the State Land Committee in&#13;
cases of initial transfer of rights from the state to private parties. However, these documents will not be&#13;
reissued in cases of secondary transactions and will not serve as a summary of legal rights in a given&#13;
property. Agreement on the mechanisms for the transfer of information to the registration offices of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice and other aspects of inter-agency roles in project implementation were reached at&#13;
negotiations and are reflected in Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement.&#13;
4.25          For each registered property, the legal cadastre must include the following information;&#13;
property identification number, identification of the owner/user, form of tenure (including information&#13;
on joint or shared ownership), easements, encumbrances, and record of parcel alienation. In addition,&#13;
there must be information depicting and locating the property. For land parcels, this will remain the&#13;
responsibility of the Land Committee. The rayon/city Architect's offices will be responsible for&#13;
maintaining depictions of structures or sub-units of structures.&#13;
4.26          While implementation of the registration system begins on the basis of paper technology,&#13;
necessary steps for introduction of an automated system will be underway. Critical for this effort will&#13;
be specification and preparation of necessary applied software (Block D in the Implementation Plan). The&#13;
Technology Oversight Group will be responsible for developing the terms of reference for developing this&#13;
software, and in managing the completion of this work. When this applied software becomes available,&#13;
the registration offices will begin shifting to an automated basis. This will require software testing first&#13;
at the oblast level and in a small number of rayons. Following the initial revision of the applied software,&#13;
implementation will be expanded to remaining rayons in the project oblasts. The rayon registration offices&#13;
will be linked with the respective rayon land committee and architect's offices in a LAN framework. In&#13;
a typical rayon, the registration offices will be provided with three computers, the land committee will&#13;
receive three and the rayon architect's offices two. All will be connected to a single file server. The&#13;
registration offices will be responsible for maintaining all attribute (text) data files associated with the&#13;
legal cadastre. The land committee and architect's offices will continue to be responsible for assigning&#13;
cadastral numbers and maintaining up-to-date depictions of land parcels and buildings, respectively.&#13;
4.27          The primary function of the staff at the Oblast registration office will be to support the&#13;
functions being performed at the rayon level. This will include overall performance supervision, training,&#13;
and technical support. Under the automated system, the oblast offices will also maintain an oblast wide&#13;
data base. As a result, these offices will also serve as information centers for the public and for the&#13;
Government. Typical staffing will include a chief registration administrator (lawyer), an assistant&#13;
registration administrator, support staff, roughly 4-5 technical support staff, and a database administrator.&#13;
4.28          Within the Ministry of Justice at the Republic level, a Registration Division will be&#13;
established. The function of the Registration Division will be to oversee the operation of the oblast&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
registration offices and the effective functioning of the national system. During the Pilot Project, with&#13;
only three oblast offices functioning, the responsibilities of this Division will be limited. Staffing of the&#13;
Division has been reduced to 12 to reflect this. The PIU will be responsible for all aspects of project&#13;
implementation, including elaboration and evolution of the registration system design.&#13;
Database Management Practices&#13;
4.29          The Technology Oversight Group will be responsible for the way in which information&#13;
is managed in the registration system, which will have a critical impact on the efficiency of the&#13;
functioning of the system, whether it be in a paper or electronic based technology. There are several&#13;
well-know principles of information management which will be applied to the Kazakstan registration&#13;
system.&#13;
4.30          Unique Identification. Each piece of information should be uniquely identified by a&#13;
number, or key, which is guaranteed not to be duplicated. This applies equally to the subjects, objects,&#13;
and rights included in the system. Each uniquely identifiable piece of information regarding rights and&#13;
changes in rights should be assigned a code, or reference number. For example, the change of right (or&#13;
encumbrance) which we call release of mortgage can be replaced by a code assigned by the Government.&#13;
The pilot project will undertake to establish this system of unique identification codes.&#13;
4.31          Non-duplicadon of Information. When information is used by organizations or agencies&#13;
that are dispersed geographically, it is important that these agencies are assured of the accuracy and&#13;
timeliness of the information. In order to ensure the validity of information, the following principles will&#13;
be followed:&#13;
(i)    Only one valid ( legal ) copy of the subject information should exist;&#13;
(ii)    The person or organization responsible for the maintenance of the information&#13;
should be clearly identified; and&#13;
(iii)   Physical copies of information should be kept to an absolute minimum. These&#13;
copies should be clearly identified as copies, or technology and procedures can&#13;
be employed to ensure that copies are valid.&#13;
4.32          Adherence to these principles will require reliable arrangements for information sharing&#13;
among participating agencies.&#13;
4.33          Information Protection. Information in the registration system must be protected from&#13;
unauthorized changes if the integrity of the system is to be maintained. This implies careful procedures&#13;
by which information in the system is added and revised as well as protection against theft of information.&#13;
For rayons implementing the paper-based system, the pilot project will follow practices used in many&#13;
Western countries of locking registration books and controlled access to those books by the public. Rayon&#13;
registration offices will also be protected against unauthorized entry. For the automated registration&#13;
system, read-only and read-write authorization will be well specified. Database security meeting the&#13;
standards of C2 will be employed.&#13;
3. Map Production&#13;
4.34          Because of the pilot nature of the project, it will not be possible to undertake new base&#13;
mapping. Rather, the project will rely upon existing maps and mapping information. While this is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
adequate to start implementation of the new registration system, it fails to address the longer term needs&#13;
of mapping for registration. The project will test, on a pilot basis, digitization of maps. Ten map sheets&#13;
of scale 1:2000 will be digitized in Almaty City and an additional ten map sheets in the nearby rayons&#13;
of Almaty Oblast. The objective of this component of the project will be to test and elaborate&#13;
methodologies for utilization of digital maps, train staff for map digitization, and examine the economic&#13;
costs and benefits of shifting from paper-based maps to electronic maps. With the merger of Kazgeodesia&#13;
mnto the State Land Committee, it was agreed at negotiations that the SLC will be responsible for base map&#13;
digitization. A cadastral digitization center will be established within the SLC that will add parcel&#13;
boundary information to these digitized base maps. The project will finance two work stations, software&#13;
(including GIS software), and peripherals to carry out this work. By the end of the pilot project,&#13;
utilization of these digital maps at the rayon level, and their updating based on feedback from the rayon&#13;
level, will be tested.&#13;
4.35          During implementation of the pilot project, the Government will undertake a thorough&#13;
assessment of the adequacy of existing maps and the need for production of new base maps over the&#13;
medium to longer-term for the purposes of registration. A full assessment is currently available for&#13;
Almaty city. Assessments will be made for the other pilot project regions (Almaty Oblast and Akmola&#13;
Oblast) by the end of December, 1996, and for any regions the Government would like to include in a&#13;
follow-on real estate registration project by the end of December, 1997.&#13;
D. PROJECT OUTPUTS&#13;
4.36          The pilot project will provide the following outputs:&#13;
(i)    Registration offices established in 34 rayons, three oblasts, and at the Republic&#13;
level;&#13;
(ii)    Operational procedures for the functioning of the registration offices defined for&#13;
both paper-based and automated technologies. As part of this, the user-interface&#13;
software will be finalized for application throughout the country;&#13;
(iii)   Model for inter-agency cooperation in the functioning of the registration system&#13;
defined. This model will include: (a) mechanisms for the transfer of existing&#13;
information on property rights from the Land Committee and other agencies to&#13;
the new registration offices; and (b) definition of the longer-term role of these&#13;
agencies in the functioning of the registration system;&#13;
(iv)   Training conducted for staff as indicated above;&#13;
(v)    Pilot testing of digital cadastral maps; and&#13;
(vi)   Determination of longer-term mapping requirements for registration.&#13;

V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. COST ESrIMATES&#13;
5.1          The estimated total project costs, including contingencies, but net of duties and taxes is&#13;
about US$13.3 million, of which about US$7.6 million is foreign costs and US$5.7 million is local costs.&#13;
Physical contingencies were estimated at 10 percent for works. Price contingency estimates assume an&#13;
increase in local costs of 15 per cent per year in 1997 and 1998 (in line with anticipated local inflation)&#13;
and in foreign costs of 2.7 percent for 1997 and 2.5 percent for 1998. Local costs comprise 42 percent&#13;
of total project costs. (Component project cost tables are presented in Annex G).&#13;

B. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
5.2          A loan of US$10 million equivalent to the Republic of Kazakstan is proposed, representing&#13;
75 percent of total project costs. This would finance 100 percent of foreign costs and 42 percent of local&#13;
costs. Local costs to be financed would be training programs, local consultants provided under the technical&#13;
assistance sub-component, and on a declining basis operating costs of the PIU. The Government would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
contribute US$3.3 million equivalent (including price contingencies) to finance the costs of staff and&#13;
premises for the registration units. VAT and customs duties will be financed by the Government. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government was informed of its currency options and elected the currency pool option.&#13;
The Government has obtained a US$1.5 million equivalent Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance for&#13;
this project. The Letter of Agreement was signed by Government on July 23, 1996. At loan effectiveness,&#13;
the PPF will be refinanced by the project loan.&#13;

5.3           Counterpart Funds. Successful project implementation requires the timely availability&#13;
of budgetary resources to finance local costs. During negotiations the Government Delegation informed&#13;
the Bank representatives that the draft national budget, prepared by the Government and submitted to&#13;
Parliament, stipulates financing of the Government's share of Project costs in the amount of US$3.3&#13;
million (in tenge) during the life of the Project.&#13;
C. FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
5.4          The loan proceeds would be channeled to the Ministry of Justice as a special line item&#13;
through the budgetary process. Bank financed expenditures at the oblast level will be coordinated by the&#13;
Ministry of Justice and the participating oblast administrations. Government counterpart financing will&#13;
be coordinated through the Republican budget. Expenditures of the State Land Committee and the&#13;
Ministry of Construction in support of the project will come from their existing budgetary allocations.&#13;
No additional staffing or premises for these two agencies is necessary.&#13;
D. COST RECOVERY&#13;
5.5           The Registration Law requires that a schedule of fees for service associated with the&#13;
system be established. The appraisal mission verified that the Government will issue a fee for service&#13;
schedule for the registration system prior to opening of the registration offices. It was agreed that fees&#13;
for service be reasonable and commensurate with fees charged for such services in other countries. The&#13;
level of cost recovery supported by these fees will depend on the level of market activity and provision&#13;
of services by the new registration offices. This will be assessed as a part of implementation of the Pilot&#13;
Project. Revenues are to be allocated primarily to the rayon level and be made available for supporting&#13;
counterpart funding requirements. Prior to negotiations, the Government issued a resolution, acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, formally establishing the fee-for-service schedule. This schedule can be adjusted based on&#13;
the experience of the pilot project.&#13;

VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
6.1           The projected Board date for the project is March 1997. Presentation to the Board was&#13;
conditional upon the Government's issuing a Resolution reaffirming inter-agency roles in the Project,&#13;
formally establishing the registration offices in the project oblasts and rayons, and authorizing necessary&#13;
staffing of these offices. This Resolution has been issued by the Government. Project effectiveness is&#13;
anticipated in May. The project will be implemented over two years. The Ministry of Justice will be&#13;
the primary implementing agency for the project. The PIU will be established under the Ministry of&#13;
Justice and report directly to the Minister. The PIU will also have representatives from the State Land&#13;
Committee and the Ministry of Construction and will serve as the body for coordinating the input of all&#13;
three agencies in project implementation. Authorized representatives of the three participating oblasts&#13;
were present during negotiations. These representatives confirmed agreement with Project objectives and&#13;
agreed in principle to provide necessary premises for the newly created registration offices of the Ministry&#13;
of Justice in accordance with the project implementation schedule.&#13;
6.2           Important input and procedural benchmarks for monitoring and supervision during&#13;
implementation of the pilot project will be: (i) availability of counterpart funds, particularly with respect&#13;
to allocation and preparation of premises for the new registration offices and to their staffing; (ii) issuing&#13;
of documents in support of the Registration Law including formal establishment of the registration service&#13;
and its staffing plan, formal adoption of the registration book and procedures for the registration of real&#13;
estate, establishment of a schedule of fees for service, and extension of the cadastral numbering system&#13;
to cover buildings; (iii) progress on the technical assistance contracts including issuing the Letter of&#13;
Invitation, receipt and evaluation of proposals, contract award, and implementation of the consultant&#13;
assignment; (iv) the conduct of training programs including elaboration of course content, training of&#13;
trainers, and the expanded phase of training; (v) preparation of the applied software for the automated&#13;
registration system including preparation of system description, contract awarded for software preparation,&#13;
first version of the software ready, testing, evaluation, and revision of first version software, acceptance&#13;
of software and distribution to project offices; (vi) procurement of goods including preparation and issuing&#13;
of bidding documents, receipt and evaluation of proposals, contract award, and delivery and installation&#13;
of equipment; and (vii) testing of map digitization including digitization of base topographic maps, training&#13;
of Land Committee staff for the digitization of parcel boundaries, and pilot testing of digital map&#13;
utilization in, and feedback from, the rayon level.&#13;
6.3           The significant output benchmarks for monitoring and supervision will be: (i) the efficient&#13;
functioning of the registration system including the level of registration activity, the reliability of&#13;
information in the registry including the efficiency of information sharing among the participating&#13;
agencies, and the average amount of time required to process basic registration transactions; and (ii) the&#13;
cost effectiveness of utilizing cadastral maps in digital form for the registration system including average&#13;
cost per parcel of initial digitization and average cost per parcel of boundary revisions.&#13;
6.4           The time schedule for implementation of the project is provided in Annex H. It is planned&#13;
to have the rayon registration offices begin functioning during April-June 1997 utilizing paper-based&#13;
technology. Following the testing of procedures in this environment, the registration offices will be&#13;
converted to automated technology in the first quarter of 1998. The automated system will be tested and&#13;
evaluated during 1998. The pilot project will be completed at the end of 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
6.5           To allow for testing and evaluation of the automated system during 1998, the terms of&#13;
reference for the preparation of the applied software for the automated registration system are to be&#13;
prepared by April 1997 and the first version of the software available for testing by December 1997, with&#13;
necessary revisions introduced by March of 1998 for roll-out to the project rayons. The bidding&#13;
documents for the two ICB contracts for goods are to be issued by april 1997 with contract award by the&#13;
end of October 1997 and delivery of equipment in the first three months of 1998. The third track of&#13;
training (for automated systems) will be coordinated with the delivery of equipment. Digitization of the&#13;
20 topographic base maps is to be completed by September 1997 and the digitization of cadastral&#13;
information is to begin in the last quarter of 1997.&#13;
6.6           Assessment of the functioning of the paper-based registration system will be made in the&#13;
last quarter of 1997. Assessment of both the automated registration system and the map digitization&#13;
program will be made in the last quarter of 1998.&#13;
6.7           On April 12, 1996 the Government issued a formal Agreement signed by the Ministry of&#13;
Justice, the State Land Committee, and the Ministry of Construction "On Inter-Agency Cooperation"&#13;
which includes a commitment on the part of all signatories to work toward the successful implementation&#13;
of the Registration Law. In particular, it states that the Land Committee offices, the BTIs, and the City&#13;
Architects' Offices will provide necessary information on land parcels and buildings for the efficient&#13;
functioning of the registry (Annex A). As part of negotiations, detailed agreement was reached on the&#13;
roles ofparticipating agencies in project implementation and incorporated into Schedule S (Implementation&#13;
Schedule) of the Loan Agreement. The Implementation Schedule provides clear guidelines on the usage&#13;
of equipment to be provided under the project. At the rayon level, the offices of the land committee and&#13;
the rayon architect will provide necessary information for the legal cadastre to the new registration offices&#13;
of the Ministry of Justice. Such transfer will be triggered by a change in legal status of a given property&#13;
(land parcel, building, or sub-unit of building) through sale, lease, mortgage or other change in legal&#13;
rights. From the time that a property enters the information base of the registration offices of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice, maintenance and update of all the legal information bearing on the property will be&#13;
the responsibility of the registration offices. The Land Committee will continue to be responsible for&#13;
maintaining graphic depiction of land parcels in the form of index maps and parcel specific plans and will&#13;
be responsible for maintaining the cadastral numbering system for land parcels. The rayon and city&#13;
architect's offices will maintain depiction of building floorplans and will update this information with the&#13;
creation of new legal properties.&#13;
6.8           Efficient functioning of the registration system will require co-locating the offices of the&#13;
land committee, the architect's offices and the registration offices at the rayon level. This arrangement&#13;
will also greatly reduce the cost of implementing the automated system. In most rayons in the project&#13;
oblasts, the existing offices of the land committee and the rayon architect are located in the main rayon&#13;
administration building. Letters have been sent to the Akims of Almaty and Akmola oblasts, and Almaty&#13;
city to make preparations for allocating necessary office space for the registration offices, and for&#13;
relocating the rayon land committee or architect's offices if necessary to insure physical proximity of the&#13;
three agencies.&#13;

B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
6.9          The procurement of all items funded from loan proceeds would be in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January, 1995, and revised in&#13;
January 1996 and August 1996). Consultants for training and technical assistance would be employed in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines Use of Consultants by the World BankBorrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981). The draft Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of&#13;
Information Systems (March 4, 1996) would be used for procurement of the automated technology for&#13;
the registration system. Other contracts would be procured on the basis of the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Goods (published in January 1995, and revised in January and August 1996). For&#13;
consultant services, the Borrower would use the Bank's relevant standard form of contract. A General&#13;
Procurement Notice has been issued in the U.N.'s Development Business, with a Special Procurement&#13;
Notice to follow at the time bid documents are issued&#13;
6.10         The PIU will be responsible for all procurement under the project. The PIU has hired&#13;
an individual responsible for handling procurement matters. Consultants financed by Italian Trust Funds&#13;
are working with the PIU from late September to mid-November to assist in preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for goods to be procured through ICB and to provide advice and guidance on the use of&#13;
Shopping Procedures.&#13;

to standard Bank guidelines for procurement of consultant services, US$700,000 for the cost of training programs and&#13;
US$140,000 to cover partial operating costs of the PIU.&#13;
6.11           Equiment.  There will be one major contract for automated technology for the&#13;
registration system, and two small contracts for survey equipment. The Borrower will retain the services&#13;
of consultants to prepare the technical specifications of the bidding documents, financed out of the PPF.&#13;
ICB procedures will be utilized for these contracts. International Shopping will be used for contracts not&#13;
exceeding US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000. This will require&#13;
obtaining quotes from at least three suppliers from at least two different countries. National Shopping&#13;
will be used for procurement of small value items that can be obtained off-the-shelf for contracts not&#13;
exceeding US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$200,000. This will require obtaining&#13;
quotes from three different local suppliers. (These ceilings allow for potential slippage in shopping&#13;
contracts that are anticipated under the PPF.)&#13;
6.12           Works.    Government financing of roughly US$300,000 will be provided for the&#13;
rehabilitation and preparation of registration offices at the oblast and rayon levels. These will be small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
value contracts (US$5,000-10,000 per office) that will be competed for locally under Shopping Procedures&#13;
and will include the installation of security devices to protect the information base and the automated&#13;
equipment located in these offices. The Ministry of Justice, in conjunction with the Technical Oversight&#13;
Group of the PIU, will be responsible for specifying the work to be carried out for the preparation of the&#13;
registration offices. During the Project Launch Supervision Mission, scheduled for April 1997, the Bank&#13;
will review these specifications to insure that they include adequate security and operating arrangements&#13;
for goods to be provided under the project.&#13;
6.13         Consultants. A consultant team will be hired through short-listing as the core of the&#13;
technical assistance program to provide expertise in legal aspects of land and real estate registration,&#13;
management of the registry, linkages between the registry and the land cadastre, and real estate market&#13;
development. This team will also provide project implementation staff to the PIU to assist with&#13;
informatics, and project management. This consultant team would be responsible to assist the Government&#13;
in development and implementation of the case-study portion of the training programs, assist with&#13;
development of the user-interface software, and provide international experience on procedures and system&#13;
management. Short-term consultants would be hired to assist with finalization of technical specifications&#13;
for bidding documents and preparation of the technical specifications for the applied software. Individual&#13;
consultants will be hired to staff the TOG. Consultants will also be hired to provide legal expertise in&#13;
the finalization of documents in support of the Registration Law.&#13;
6.14         Training. The project will finance the costs of training programs. For the first two&#13;
programs of training this will include transportation and per diem costs of trainees, as well as cost of&#13;
premises in Almaty and Akmola and training supplies. Trainers for these two programs will be financed&#13;
through consultant contracts. The third program of training (computer software) will be provided by&#13;
authorized representatives of the firms selected to provide software as part of the major ICB contract for&#13;
goods. The project will finance the costs of these training packages, as well as the transportation and per&#13;
diem expenses of trainees.&#13;
6.15         Operating Costs. Operating costs comprise the costs of establishing and running the&#13;
registration offices of the MOJ at the rayon and oblast levels, the Registration Division of the MOJ at the&#13;
national level, and the PIU. The Bank will finance the operating costs of the PIU associated with its&#13;
administration of activities under the project, which would not have been incurred without the project,&#13;
such as the cost of rent, utilities, salaries, office equipment and supplies, communications, and&#13;
transportation, on a declining basis.&#13;
6.16         Bank Review. All contracts for goods estimated to cost US$200,000 or more would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank, as well as the first two contracts for goods estimated to cost&#13;
US$100,000 or more. All contracts for consultant services with consulting firms valued at more than&#13;
US$100,000, and with individual consultants valued at more than US$30,000 would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank. For contracts for consultant services below these threshholds, terms of reference,&#13;
single-source selection of firms or individuals, and assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by the Bank, would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to ex-post review by the Bank on a random basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
6.17           The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of two and a half years, with the expected project completion date of December 31, 1998 and loan closing&#13;
date of June 30, 1999. During negotiations it was agreed that the Ministry of Finance, through the&#13;
CUFC, will clear all withdrawal applications, in accordance with Government Resolution No. 213-r of&#13;
May 3, 1996. The bulk of project disbursements will be accounted for by two contracts; the automated&#13;
technology for the registration system and the main contract for technical assistance. Signing of the main&#13;
TA contract occurred in January 1997 while signing of the main goods contract is anticipated in July&#13;
1997, leaving ample time for execution and full disbursement.&#13;
6.18           Loan proceeds would be disbursed against eligible project expenditures either directly to&#13;
suppliers, by means of special commitments to support letters of credit issued by the Borrower's bank in&#13;
favor of foreign suppliers of goods and services, or by way of reimbursement to participating agencies&#13;
where expenditures have already been incurred. Disbursement for all contracts for goods at or above&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent would be made against full documentation, and for those less than this amount&#13;
would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursement for services under contracts&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms, and contracts costing less than US$30,000 equivalent&#13;
for individuals would be made against SOEs. Disbursement for all other contracts for services would&#13;
require full documentation. Full documentation in support of SOEs would be retained by the PIU for the&#13;
life of the pilot project. This information would be available to: (i) auditors retained by the Borrower in&#13;
accordance with auditing requirements for the project; and (ii) World Bank staff for review during&#13;
supervision.&#13;
6.19           The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed as shown in Table 6.2 below:&#13;

with 100 percent of those costs covered in the first year of the loan, reduced to 80 percent in the second&#13;
year.&#13;
6.21         Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a&#13;
Special Account in a major commercial bank. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation&#13;
of the Special Account would be limited to US$100,000. However, when the aggregate disbursement&#13;
under the Loan has reached the level of US$1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$200,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled&#13;
bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The Borrower will provide specific&#13;
names of individuals authorized to withdraw funds. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account&#13;
would be submitted quarterly or when one-half of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Documentation procedures would follow the same procedures as described above. Monthly bank&#13;
statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
D. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
6.22         Project accounts would be managed by the PIU. The PIU will have a staff member with&#13;
professional training in accounting to handle this work. That individual will receive assistance from staff&#13;
of the Resident Mission in Almaty and the CUFC in setting up the necessary accounting arrangements for&#13;
the project. The project accounts would identify all sources and uses of funds, including detailed&#13;
accounting of the proceeds of the loan and the operation of the Special Account. For the Special Account,&#13;
the PIU and the depository commercial bank would introduce arrangements for the proper accounting of&#13;
receipts, payments, and submission of disbursement documentation to the World Bank for replenishment&#13;
of the account. Under the negotiated Loan Agreement, the Government has agreed to have the project&#13;
accounts, including those for the Special Account, audited each fiscal year, in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing principles, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and audit reports would&#13;
be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of thefiscal year. The audit report would contain&#13;
a separate opinion on the operation of the Special Account and the use of the procedures for the Statement&#13;
of Expenditure (SOE).&#13;
E. PROJECT MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
6.23         Major project monitoring benchmarks are provided in the Performance Monitoring Annex&#13;
(Annex I). Under the negotiated Loan Agreement, the Government has agreed to monitor and evaluate&#13;
on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators agreed by the Bank and the Borrower, the&#13;
implementation of the Project and the achievement of project objectives. The PIU will be responsible for&#13;
monitoring all aspects of project implementation. In this effort they will rely on reporting of the&#13;
representation the oblast administration responsible for overseeing project implementation the oblast&#13;
registration groups, and information from the State Land Committee and the Ministry of Construction on&#13;
the progress of work undertaken by agencies other than the Ministry of Justice. In particular, the PIU&#13;
will monitor: (i) the installation and use of equipment in the registration offices, including provision of&#13;
supplies, spare parts and repair services; (ii) staffing and adequate premises for these offices; (iii) the&#13;
conduct of training and technical assistance activities at the oblast and rayon levels; (iv) arrangements for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
information sharing and overall interagency cooperation at the oblast and rayon levels; and (v) project&#13;
accounts and expenditures at the oblast and rayon levels.&#13;
6.24          The PIU will provide quarterly reports to the Bank throughout the life of the project.&#13;
These reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than 30 days after the close of each quarter and&#13;
would include sections on: (i) project finances; (ii) procurement; (iii) conduct of training programs;&#13;
(iv) establishment of registration offices; (iv) implementation of technical assistance contracts; (v) level&#13;
of monthly transactions in each of the operating registration offices; (vi) information sharing arrangements&#13;
in place among agencies in each rayon; and (vii) assessment of problems encountered, proposed measures&#13;
to overcome them, and any assistance required. The financial section will provide accounting of&#13;
expenditures financed by the World Bank and by the Government. The reports will draw comparisons&#13;
between the agreed implementation plan by quarter and actual results. Initial evaluation of the pilot&#13;
project will be conducted during the July 1998 supervision mission in collaboration with the consultant&#13;
team and the PIU. This evaluation will be finalized during the project completion mission in November&#13;
1998. During negotiations agreement was reached on criteria to be used in assessing the effectiveness&#13;
of the Project. These will focus on the level of client interaction with the new registration system and&#13;
include the number of sales, leases, and mortgages of land and real estate, and the nunber of information&#13;
requests received and satisfied by the registration offices.&#13;
6.25          As SOEs and a Special Account would be used in this project, the PIU would be requested&#13;
to submit, along with the quarterly reports: (i) a schedule of SOEs listing individual expenditures and&#13;
amounts; and (ii) a summary of Special Account activity and reconciliation with the Special Account&#13;
balance in the commercial bank account and the Project Account.&#13;
F. SUPERVISION&#13;
6.26          The Bank will focus on the performance indicators provided in Annex I in conducting its&#13;
supervision of the project. The supervision plan is provided in Annex J. Supervision missions would be&#13;
planned for roughly every 4 months of project implementation and would include a specialist in&#13;
registration systems and an information technology specialist as indicated in the plan. These missions&#13;
would review the allocation of counterpart funds, the physical implementation targets, monitor the impact&#13;
of the institution building aspects of the project, assess the arrangements and actual practice for inter-&#13;
agency cooperation, identify critical implementation problems and agree on remedial actions. The PIU&#13;
will be connected to the Bank's All-in-1 system and a combination of phone, fax, and E-mail links&#13;
between Headquarters and the PIU will be utilized between supervision missions. In addition, the staff&#13;
of the Resident Mission will play an important supervisory role between supervision missions and will&#13;
participate directly in the work of those missions while in the field.&#13;
6.27          Project Launch Workshop. The initial supervision mission would be a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop. This will be scheduled immediately after loan signing and be timed to include the&#13;
participation of consultants hired under the PPF. Other participants would be the staff of the PIU, other&#13;
representatives of the Ministry of Justice, State Land Committee, and Ministry of Construction (including&#13;
from the oblast and rayon levels), representatives from the oblast and rayon registration offices, and&#13;
representatives of the CUFC. The workshop would cover the implementation schedule, technology to be&#13;
provided and technology support, training and technical assistance programs, basic office procedures and&#13;
standard forms, arrangements for inter-agency cooperation and information sharing, reporting&#13;
requirements from the rayon and oblast levels, project financing, accounting and reporting requirements,&#13;
fees for service and fee allocation, staffing, preparation of premises, and others.&#13;

VII. KEY ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS, AND BENEFITS&#13;
A. KEY ASSUMPTiONS AND RISKS&#13;
7.1           A major reason for choosing a pilot project to address the task of establishing a real estate&#13;
registration system in Kazakstan was precisely that the risks associated with this undertaking were&#13;
significant. The following assumptions and risks are associated with the project components.&#13;
7.2           For the project to be successful, counterpart funds sufficient to staff and house the new&#13;
registration offices will be essential. The Government is required by the Registration Law to establish&#13;
these offices. The transfer of the former BTI offices to the Ministry of Justice avoids unnecessary&#13;
duplication of work, but still represents a net burden on the national budget. By limiting the scope of the&#13;
pilot project, the immediate financial burden on the Government is reduced. Because the project foresees&#13;
cost recovery mechanisms through a system of fees for service, roll out of a successful pilot will require&#13;
less of a net drain on the budget. This will be monitored closely during implementation. Arrangements&#13;
for cost-sharing among the national, oblast and rayon budgets will also be closely monitored during&#13;
implementation.&#13;
7.3           The Ministry of Justice at present lacks the capacity to implement the project. The Bank&#13;
has proposed programs of training and technical assistance which are well designed to meet the institution&#13;
building needs of the Ministry of Justice. Here, too, the immediate burden on the Ministry of Justice is&#13;
reduced as a result of the pilot scale of the project. The training programs, once established, will provide&#13;
the necessary skills to implement the pilot as well as to prepare for expansion of the system beyond the&#13;
project rayons. The civil service pay scale may represent an obstacle in the retention of staff receiving&#13;
training in automated technology and for the location of appropriate individuals as rayon chief registrars.&#13;
7.4           Appropriate cooperation among relevant agencies is required for the project to be fully&#13;
successful.  A  breakdown in inter-agency cooperation would seriously undercut prospects for&#13;
implementation of the new registration system. The agencies assisting the Ministry of Justice in&#13;
establishing the registration system have mandates that go well beyond the scope of registration. The&#13;
Land Committee has significant land administration and land monitoring functions under the recently&#13;
adopted Land Code. The city and rayon architects offices are reasserting their roles as building inspection&#13;
offices. In addition, the information needed for the registration system represents a small piece of the&#13;
data bases of these organizations and therefore, not a threat to their future areas of work. The pilot&#13;
project approach will allow for flexibility in design and the precise nature of inter-agency cooperation.&#13;
7.5           Experience from similar projects (both Bank and non-Bank financed) shows that provision&#13;
of user-interface software frequently runs into delays and holds up planned implementation of automated&#13;
information systems. The Bank has emphasized this potential danger beginning with the last preparation&#13;
mission and has encouraged the Government to locate necessary consultants to complete this work. Use&#13;
of the PPF to get necessary consultants on board well ahead of loan effectiveness will reduce the risk of&#13;
delays in developing the user-interface software. Again, because of the pilot nature of the project the&#13;
software will undergo extensive testing during project implementation, which allows time for elaboration&#13;
of a fully tested version for wider implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
7.6           Procurement of most automated technology under this project will be in accordance with&#13;
ICB procedures. This will entail a good deal of lead time to complete. As experience from the Region&#13;
shows, lack of familiarity with ICB can significantly delay project implementation. The Bank has located&#13;
trust funds for preparation of bidding documents and has conducted a one-week review in Washington&#13;
with consultants financed by these trust funds of the latest World Bank standard documents for&#13;
procurement of goods and procurement of computer equipment. The Bank has also provided assistance&#13;
in finalizing the technical specifications for the bidding documents.&#13;
7.7           Because the ultimate goal of the pilot is to provide a reliable basis for a national system,&#13;
the following further assumptions and risks should be considered. It is assumed that the population will&#13;
choose to use the system. While the Law does not make registration of property rights mandatory, it does&#13;
recognize the superiority of registered to unregistered rights. Fragmented registration of rights in real&#13;
estate has already taken place in the form of issuing State Acts for land and Privatization Acts for other&#13;
real estate, indicating the population's interest in such protection. The incentive to register property rights&#13;
will be strong not only for new owners, but for those holding servitudes or encumbrances on a property,&#13;
for example, a bank holding a mortgage or an individual holding a right-of-way across a neighbor's&#13;
parcel. Development of a registration system will facilitate the collection of tax revenue, and in that way&#13;
provide disincentives to participate. While there was interest expressed by some in building a true fiscal&#13;
cadastre into the project, the project design has remained squarely focused on the legal cadastre, thereby&#13;
emphasizing the property rights aspects of the system.&#13;
7.8           For the system to be financially sustainable, the level of market activity must be sufficient&#13;
to generate necessary revenues. Project oblasts have been selected in large part based on anticipated&#13;
market activity in the immediate term. Sales of real estate (both ownership and use rights) is already well&#13;
developed. The existing legislative framework is considered sufficient for market activity in real estate&#13;
to develop further.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPFCTS&#13;
7.9           The Project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment. The move towards&#13;
private land rights promoted by the Project is expected to foster a greater sense of individual responsibility&#13;
for the environment and a more prudent use of land and other natural resources, particularly of&#13;
agricultural land. The ability eventually to integrate other data sets onto the land register base, will also&#13;
bring positive environmental benefits, as a result of the means that such data sets will provide for&#13;
environmental monitoring and control. These benefits will not be immediate and will only be achieved&#13;
after further investment in a wider land information system.&#13;
7.10          The Project has a "C" environmental assessment category. Any environmental concerns&#13;
which develop, will be addressed during implementation by applying the Bank's and the country's&#13;
environmental requirements and guidelines.&#13;
C. BENEFITS&#13;
7.11          A register of titles represents an important part of the public infrastructure of a market-&#13;
based economy. Clarification and security of rights in real property are an essential step in the transition&#13;
from the pre-reform economy of Kazakstan. Reliable registration is the means by which capital&#13;
investment in real estate in increasingly complex economies is secured and traded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
7.12          The economic benefits to the individual or corporate owner of real estate rights are&#13;
numerous. First, security of tenure is backed by the State, putting the ownership of the rights beyond&#13;
dispute and providing the basis on which owners of rights can expend effort and capital with the confident&#13;
expectation of earning a return. The register provides the basis on which mortgagees can secure collateral&#13;
for the loans they make. At present, mortgaging of real property is significantly hindered by the lack of&#13;
reliable documentation of rights. The ability to transact real estate rights enables successful businesses&#13;
to grow and allows the rights of businesses which fail to be reallocated through the market, rather than&#13;
left idle or underutilized. By facilitating sales and leases, the registration system improves the functioning&#13;
of these markets, and in turn, the valuation of real property. The function of a register to assist in the&#13;
continuing process of farm restructuring is especially significant in this respect. The project will reduce&#13;
the number of boundary disputes by utilizing a method of parcel adjudication which incorporates input&#13;
and agreement from neighbors on boundary location at the time of registration.&#13;
7.13           The registration system provides further benefits to the Government by establishing the&#13;
essential legal layer in a cadastral information system.   A reliable legal cadastre will provide the&#13;
Government with an improved information basis for assessing the value of real property and in the&#13;
functioning of the tax administration. The legal cadastre can be supplemented subsequently with relevant&#13;
fiscal information to further improve the process of property assessment and real estate tax collection.&#13;
The establishment of the legal cadastre will assist the Government in carrying out its administrative&#13;
functions with respect to land and real estate. In the process of registering rights, land and real estate&#13;
remaining in public ownership will likewise be recorded in the register. Unauthorized dealings in such&#13;
property can be prevented and thus the register will help to maintain the integrity of public lands and&#13;
designated sites of special environmental or other importance.&#13;
7.14          The project will allow the Government to test alternative technologies in implementing&#13;
a registration system in the project oblasts prior to making decisions about expansion of the system&#13;
nationwide. Phased implementation of the registration system, utilizing a pilot project first, also allows&#13;
time for necessary institution building and the testing of office procedures, formats, and inter-agency&#13;
working relations on a modest scale, prior to implementation on a broad scale.&#13;
D. BENEFICIARIES&#13;
7.15          The primary beneficiaries of the project will be holders of rights in land and other real&#13;
estate. In rural and urban sectors, the project will help to secure these rights and their value. In&#13;
agriculture the register will help to provide entry and exit mechanisms for farmers. In urban areas, the&#13;
market backed by the register will help mobility of people and businesses. The register will increase the&#13;
security of transactions and reduce the cost. In the long term the nation will benefit from improved&#13;
agricultural production and revenues.&#13;
7.16          The Government will benefit from the project in terms of building essential institutional&#13;
capacity within the involved agencies; the Ministry of Justice, the State Land Committee, and the Ministry&#13;
of Construction.&#13;

- 50 -                                  Annex C&#13;
10.          One of the most important changes that the land registration system will introduce to&#13;
Kazakstan's government is an integrated computer system with a relational data base that will be shared&#13;
by more than one organizational unit of the government. The success of a project like this depends&#13;
heavily on the cooperation of all parties and a complete understanding of each others roles. Each&#13;
participating group must understand their individual responsibilities as well as how their work fits into&#13;
the overall land registration system.&#13;
11.          Insuring that all parties understand their roles from a technology point of view will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Technical Oversight Group (TOG). As new ways of performing old tasks are&#13;
developed it will be this group's task to make sure that the processes are understood by all and that they&#13;
make sense from a technology viewpoint. This will, of course, hold true for new processes that have&#13;
never taken place before as well.&#13;
12.          It will be very important that the TOG be staffed with people with a variety of different&#13;
skills ranging for computer software specialist, to people with a complete understanding of the day to day&#13;
operations of various jobs at the rayon and oblast levels. Computer hardware specialist will be needed&#13;
to make sure that implementation does not result in a system that is too difficult to manage at the local&#13;
level or too simplistic to handle the anticipated load at the oblast and national levels.&#13;
13.          The TOG leader should be a person that has a complete understanding of the land&#13;
registration system and how each of the various participants will be effected by its implementation. The&#13;
leader should have a solid technical background in both hardware and software components, with an&#13;
emphasis on the software more than hardware. The reasoning behind this logic of a software rather than&#13;
hardware emphasis is that it is anticipated that once actual hardware components are chosen, it will be&#13;
the responsibility of the vendor l system integrator to install and insure that the overall system is fully&#13;
functional from a hardware perspective at the national, oblast, and rayon levels.&#13;
14.          This person must be able to coordinate the information flows between and among the&#13;
participating groups. Because the land registration process requires inputs from the Land Committee,&#13;
Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Justice, the linkages and dependencies must be understood&#13;
and from a technical perspective, made as smooth as possible.&#13;
15.          The most important piece of software that will be developed for the land registration&#13;
system will be the user-interface software. This is the software that end users of the system at the oblast&#13;
and rayon levels will see on a daily basis. It is imperative that this software be both easy to understand&#13;
and use and sophisticated enough to manage the data relationships that are necessary to track each of the&#13;
land registration transactions. The TOG must have a member that has had experience in developing and&#13;
implementing large scale relational data base projects. This person must be able to guide the design and&#13;
implementation of the relational data base.&#13;
16.          This person should have excellent communication skills and be able to converse with the&#13;
end users who will initially know little about computers and land registration. He or she must also be&#13;
capable of guiding and directing software development persons who may know little about the process of&#13;
registering legal rights to land ownership. Understanding the major concepts of relational data base design&#13;
and effective screen design are a must for this position.&#13;
17.          Often, initial success of a project of this magnitude can be judged by how well the new&#13;
system is received by end users. A very important function that the TOG will perform will be to review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                                  Annex C&#13;
and help set priorities for the educational aspects of the project. A person with good organizational and&#13;
computer skills will be needed to make sure that training programs are presented in a systematic and&#13;
coordinated manner and that they are thorough enough.&#13;
18.          A computer hardware specialist will serve as a very vital member of the TOG. This&#13;
person will help to review any tenders for computer technology that will be a part of the pilot and overall&#13;
national system. The components will vary widely from large scale multi-user UNIX systems at one end&#13;
of the spectrum, to modems and printers at the other end. Choosing the right hardware solution for each&#13;
of the unique situations the land registration system is needed for will be very important. Remembering&#13;
the educational and technical skills of the ultimate end users of the system will be important. Just because&#13;
a solution appears to be the best for one situation or group of people, it does not mean it is the best for&#13;
everyone. Technical aspects of hardware can be very detailed and tedious but are critical to understand&#13;
and apply correctly. Relying on the advice of vendors is not always a safe means of developing and&#13;
evaluating specifications of hardware capabilities and performance.&#13;
19.          As stated before, the technical expert members of the TOG must also have a good&#13;
understanding of the overall goals and objectives of the system. These persons must know the basics of&#13;
what the land registration system will do and be able to translate that into hardware needs and capabilities.&#13;
Failure to grasp the big picture may result in technology that is either over specified for the task, or not&#13;
capable of managing the load placed on it by end users.&#13;
20.           One of the major objectives of Land Committee for the pilot project is to establish&#13;
methods and procedures for producing digital maps from existing paper maps and coordinates collected&#13;
in the field. Because this procedure will be spread to the cadastral units of all 19 oblasts in Kazakstan,&#13;
it is very important that these methods be comprehensive and easy to teach and understand. This person&#13;
must completely understand digital mapping and the implication that these types of maps bring to the&#13;
registration system.&#13;
21.           The pilot project should serve as a testing ground for the complete nationwide roll-out of&#13;
the registration system. TOG members must be prepared to take a step back from the day to day&#13;
operations of the system and evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen solution from a technical viewpoint.&#13;
This evaluation will be primarily from a technical perspective, but would also include an evaluation of&#13;
the user-interface software. Remembering that the pilot project should be viewed as the first installation&#13;
of a system that will be used nationally. Computer capabilities and other technical solutions implemented&#13;
for the pilot project will be duplicated though out Kazakstan and if they are mishandled, success of the&#13;
overall land registration system could be placed in jeopardy.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION PILOT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
CORE CONSULTANT TEAM&#13;
1.           The Government of Kazakstan has been working with the World Bank in preparation of&#13;
a Real Estate Registration Project. The objectives of the Project are to assist the Government in&#13;
implementation of the Presidential Decree with force of law "On State Registration of Rights and&#13;
Transactions in Real Estate", issued December 25, 1995 and attached to these terms of reference. The&#13;
Decree requires the establishment of a legal cadastre and system of registration offices under the auspices&#13;
of the Ministry of Justice to register legal rights in real property. The Decree provides an essential legal&#13;
foundation for the registration system, but will require subsequent elaboration in the form of supporting&#13;
resolutions and other documents to fully define a practicable system.&#13;
2.           The Ministry of Justice is the Government agency primarily responsible for&#13;
implementation of the Real Estate Registration Project. Other agencies that will play a role in project&#13;
implementation are the State Land Committee, the city and rayon architect's offices under the system of&#13;
the Ministry of Construction, [and the offices of the former Bureaus of Technical Inventory]. These&#13;
agencies have undertaken registration of particular types of rights in real property in the past. In&#13;
accordance with the Registration Decree, these functions are now to be unified in the new registration&#13;
offices of the Ministry of Justice. The Project will incorporate a mechanism for the transfer of these&#13;
functions. In addition, these other agencies will continue to play a long-term role in the new registration&#13;
system, by providing necessary information on land parcels and buildings and maintaining the land and&#13;
building cadastres with physical information on real property.&#13;
3.           In light of the immediate and pressing needs for system design and institution building,&#13;
the decision has been made to develop a Pilot Phase for the intended Real Estate Registration Project.&#13;
The Pilot Project will allow the Government to elaborate the design of the new registration system, and&#13;
to get that system up and running. If the Pilot Project is successfully implemented, then the Government&#13;
will be prepared to roll out the resulting design throughout the country. This phase of work would be&#13;
financed by the full loan for the Real Estate Registration Project. It is important that the Pilot Project&#13;
define a system that can be implemented equally in either a paper-based or automated environment. Both&#13;
technologies will need to be tested in the Pilot Project and the eventual roll-out with involve&#13;
implementation of both.&#13;
4.           Work under the Pilot Project will come in two major parts. The first part will address&#13;
the design of the registration system, the second will address its implementation and testing.  The&#13;
Government has received a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance from the World Bank of $1.5&#13;
million which will, in part, finance consultant services to be provided prior to effectiveness of the Real&#13;
Estate Registration Pilot Project loan. The contract being tendered covers the work to be financed out&#13;
of the PPF. If a Loan for the Real Estate Registration Pilot Project is made, and on the basis of&#13;
satisfactory completion of work required under the PPF, the Government of Kazakstan has the option to&#13;
request an extension of the contract through completion of the Pilot Project.&#13;
&#13;

and preparation of the Real Estate Registration Pilot Project:&#13;
(a)    establish a Project Preparation Unit that will be the focal point of the&#13;
Government's subsequent preparation efforts and serve as the primary counterpart&#13;
for the World Bank in this effort;&#13;
(b)    finalize draft resolutions and other documents necessary to implement the&#13;
Presidential Decree with force of law "On State Registration of Real Estate&#13;
Rights and Transactions" (henceforth, Registration Law) and provide the&#13;
necessary foundation for implementing a registration system;&#13;
(c)    establish national and regional demonstration and training centers to provide a&#13;
focal point for training efforts for establishment of the registration system;&#13;
(d)    design and implement domestic training programs to familiarize with relevant&#13;
models of real property registration;&#13;
(e)    prepare bidding documents for goods to be procured in accordance with&#13;
procedures for international competitive bidding (ICB) under the Project;&#13;
(f)    prepare user-interface software for testing in the pilot phase of the Project.&#13;
6.            The Project Preparation Unit. The Project Preparation Unit (PPU) will be responsible&#13;
for overseeing project preparation on a day-to-day basis, insure that progress is being made on the&#13;
outstanding issues, and serve as a primary contact with the World Bank for the rest of the preparation&#13;
phase of the project. The PPU will be responsible for: (a) monitoring progress by Government agencies&#13;
in preparing necessary documents for the project; (b) managing preparatory work on bidding documents&#13;
for the procurement of goods and services for the Project; (c) handling logistical arrangements for&#13;
consultants hired during the preparation phase of the Project; (d) overseeing the design and&#13;
implementation of training programs and a national training center; (e) setting up accounting and reporting&#13;
mechanisms for use in the implementation phase of the Project; (f) serving as a clearinghouse for&#13;
resolving inter-agency arrangements associated with the Project; and (g) other preparation functions as&#13;

7.            The PPU will be composed of 11 local staff in the following areas; Unit Head, Project&#13;
Management Assistant, Specialist in Automated Technology, Land Cadastre Expert, Buildings Cadastre&#13;
Expert, Accountant and Procurement Specialist, a Lawyer - Legal Cadastre Expert, a Logistics Specialist,&#13;
a Translator, a Secretary, and a Driver. A Technology Oversight Group (TOG) will be established as&#13;
a sub-unit of the PPU with a staff of five and overall responsibility for all aspects of utilizing automated&#13;
technology under the Project. The Specialist in Automated Technology will simultaneously serve as the&#13;
Head of the Technology Oversight Group and will report on these matters directly to the Head of the&#13;
PPU. The PPU will report to the Ministry of Justice, but will also coordinate its activity with the State&#13;
Land Committee and the Ministry of Construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                                 Annex D&#13;
8.            The consultant team is expected to work directly with the PPU in carrying out its overall&#13;
assignment. The head of the consultant team will interact directly with the head of the PPU in&#13;
coordinating the efforts of the consultant team with that of the Government and ensuring the satisfactory&#13;
conduct of work required under this contract. In-country logistical arrangements for consultants will be&#13;
handled by the PPU. In the course of its work, the consultant team is expected to make available to the&#13;
PPU expertise in the design of a project implementation and management plan according to the World&#13;
Bank procedures and in establishing accounting and financial reporting mechanism.&#13;
9.            Completion of Supporting Documents. The Registration Law requires the preparation&#13;
of supporting resolutions to elaborate the future functioning of the registration system. Some of these&#13;
documents have already been prepared, including an overall inter-agency agreement on cooperation in the&#13;
functioning of the registration system, procedures for assigning cadastral numbers to land parcels, and&#13;
a revised format for the Acts for land. Other documents that are scheduled to be completed by the end&#13;
of September include: formal adoption of the registration book and registration sheet; formal registration&#13;
of the Registration Service of the Ministry of Justice (rayon, oblast and national registration offices) and&#13;
its staffing plan; a instructions on procedures for registration of land and real estate; formal adoption of&#13;
a fee-for-service schedule; and extension of the recently adopted cadastral number system for land parcels&#13;
to buildings and sub-units of buildings.&#13;
10.          The consultant team will review these supporting documents and provide comment and&#13;
recommendations for additional work, including the identification of additional documents necessary for&#13;
the efficient implementation and functioning of the registration system.&#13;
i1.           Training programs. The PPF will finance the design and implementation of domestic&#13;
training programs. The following training programs will be developed;&#13;
(a)    For the Registrars and other legally trained staff of the oblast and rayon&#13;
Registration Offices, and for relevant staff of the Registration Department of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice a training program will be designed to address conceptual&#13;
legal and administrative issues associated with the functioning of real estate&#13;
registration system in Kazakstan on the basis of the country's emerging legal and&#13;
procedural foundation and the experience of other countries.&#13;
(b)    For operational staff of the Registration Offices, the land committee offices, and&#13;
offices of the Ministry of Construction, a program of training will be designed&#13;
to address issues of operational procedures, client interaction, data base&#13;
management, etc. as well as providing exposure to the basic legal issues and legal&#13;
implications of the activity of a real estate registration system.&#13;
12.          The training programs will be offered in two parts. The first part will address the existing&#13;
legal framework in Kazakstan and will be conducted between November, 1996 and February 1997. The&#13;
second part will focus on case studies drawn from international experience and will be implemented in&#13;
March-April 1997. The total number of staff expected to receive training under the PPF is approximately&#13;
380.&#13;
13.          The consultant team will work with the Government to develop the design and assist in&#13;
implementation of the second part of the above training programs. Interaction with relevant Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                                 Annex D&#13;
agencies will be coordinated by the PPU. The consultant team will be responsible for identifying and&#13;
elaborating case studies appropriate for the registration system being implemented under this Project,&#13;
which assumes separate conduct of land and legal cadastres. The consultant team will also take part in&#13;
conducting this portion of the training programs in conjunction with the PPU and domestic legal&#13;
consultants.&#13;
14.          Preparation of bidding documents for goods. By the end of 1996, the Government will&#13;
issue bidding documents for goods for two contracts that will require international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) procedures; the automated registration system, and field survey equipment. This work will be&#13;
undertaken outside of the contract for this assignment.&#13;
15.          Preparation of User-Interface Software. The development of a unique registration system&#13;
for Kazakstan will entail the design and use of tables and procedures unique to the country. For&#13;
application of such a system using automated technology, customized user-interface software will be&#13;
required. This will be designed to be compatible with any automated systems package that would be&#13;
procured under ICB. It is critical that work on designing the user-interface software be integrated with&#13;
the elaboration of the system itself, in particular the design of the registration list and definition of&#13;
standard procedures and formats required to elaborate the Registration Decree. The terms of reference&#13;
for the design of the user-interface software will be prepared in the fall of 1996. The user-interface&#13;
software will be developed during the first half of 1997 by a local firm while the registration system is&#13;
being implemented on the basis of paper technology. It will be tested and modified as soon as it is&#13;
developed with subsequent distribution to the rayon and oblast registration offices. The responsibility&#13;
for preparing the user-interface software will not be covered by this contract.&#13;
16.          The consultant team, upon its arrival in Kazakstan, will advise the PPU on the terms of&#13;
reference for the user-interface software and will interact with the local firm preparing the software as&#13;
instructed by the PPU.&#13;
Scope of Work - Pilot Project Loan&#13;
17.          Following effectiveness of a loan for the Real Estate Registration Pilot Project, and&#13;
assuming satisfactory completion of assignments financed out of the PPF, the Government reserves the&#13;
right to extend the contract for consultant services through completion of the Pilot Project. The work to&#13;
be undertaken under the loan for the Pilot Project would directly follow from the assignment under the&#13;
PPF and can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Functioning of the Project Implementation Unit. The PPU would transform into&#13;
a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with increased responsibilities in project&#13;
management, procurement, and accounting. In all three areas, the consultant firm&#13;
would be expected to continue to provide assistance and support during the&#13;
implementation of the Pilot Project. The objective would be to have a fully&#13;
independent PPU by the end of the Pilot capable of handling all necessary aspects&#13;
of implementation of a World Bank project independently. In particular the&#13;
consultant firm would assist in processing documents associated with project&#13;
procurement, oversee project accounting and reporting in accordance with the&#13;
design developed under the PPF, and provide advice and guidance on emerging&#13;
issues and problems associated with implementation of the Pilot.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                                 Annex D&#13;
(b)    Training Programs. Depending on the date of Loan effectiveness, work on the&#13;
training programs could continue into the implementation phase of the Project.&#13;
A separate training program for software to be procured under the Project will&#13;
be conducted in the fall of 1997. The consultant team will be expected to&#13;
monitor the conduct of this training.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring and Adjusting Project Design. This would include working with the&#13;
Government to carry out the agreed implementation plan for the Pilot,&#13;
troubleshooting for emerging problems and bottlenecks in project design and&#13;
making any adjustments or additions to the procedural or operational framework.&#13;
The consultant team will take part in testing of the software and provide&#13;
comments and recommendations for its modification. By the end of the Pilot,&#13;
project design should be sufficiently tested and elaborated for implementation&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
(d)    Technical Assistance in Registration Related Areas. As an integral part of its&#13;
work in the above three areas, the consulting firm will make available to the&#13;
Government during the Pilot Project expertise in the areas of; (a) administrative&#13;
and management aspects of registration systems, (b) development of real estate&#13;
markets, (c) further elaboration of the legal and procedural framework for&#13;
efficient functioning of real estate markets, (d) improved integration of the land&#13;
and buildings cadastres with the legal cadastre and priority improvements in the&#13;
land and buildings cadastres, (e) preparation of bidding documents for goods&#13;
anticipated under the roll-out of the Pilot Real Estate Registration Project, and (f)&#13;
functioning of the automated registration system and its enhanced integration with&#13;
existing information bases.&#13;
Requirements of the Consulting Firm&#13;
18.          The consulting firm will be required to field a team of consultants in accordance with the&#13;
above scope of work for the PPF and the following individual terms of reference. The firm should be&#13;
prepared to demonstrate experience with handling registration issues in the former USSR and highlight&#13;
areas where work already done could be readily applied to the case of Kazakstan. All relevant available&#13;
materials should be provided in Russian. The consulting firm is responsible for carrying out the work&#13;
described in these terms of reference and providing the output listed below. The primary point of contact&#13;
within the Government for the consulting firm will be the PPU. The primary implementing agency for&#13;
the PPF and the Pilot Project is the Ministry of Justice. The PPU will coordinate the interaction of the&#13;
consultant team with counterparts in the Government. In-country assignments under the PPF will vary&#13;
in length from one to six months. While consultants are not in-country, the consulting firm should assure&#13;
that reliable links are available for the Government to communicate as necessary with them for the&#13;
purpose of clarification.&#13;
19.          The consulting firm is requested to nominate in its proposal a team of experts as follows;&#13;
(1) specialist in real estate registration systems, (2) specialist in real estate markets, (3) a lawyer with&#13;
expertise in real estate registration and the development of real estate markets, (4) an information&#13;
technology expert, and (5) a specialist in land cadastre systems and their relationship to a legal cadastre.&#13;
The consulting firm will be required to provide the team nominees included in the proposal. In cases&#13;
&#13;

duration of the assignment.  All other staff will be in-country roughly half-time.&#13;
21.           Fulfillment of the scope of work associated with the PPF will require approximately 13-14&#13;
staff months. While the scope of work to be financed by the Pilot Project Loan is subject to further&#13;
elaboration based on work under the PPF, it is currently estimated that the Pilot Project will require&#13;
approximately 25-30 additional staff months, and will be implemented from April 1997 to December&#13;
1998.&#13;
22.           Output.  The consulting firm will be required to provide monthly reports to the&#13;
Government on the progress in implementing this assignment, with a review of the areas of work&#13;
described above. In addition, the firm will be required to produce and document the case-study portion&#13;
of the training programs as indicated above. The Government may call on the consultant team to assist&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                 Annex D&#13;
the basis of the Government's agreed approach to inter-agency cooperation in this sphere. Prior&#13;
experience with the organizational responsibilities for maintaining cadastral information on land and&#13;
buildings, and the handling of registration of rights since 1991 in the countries of the former USSR, as&#13;
well as knowledge of Russian is a significant plus, but not required. The Land Cadastre Expert should&#13;
be in-country for approximately 3 months during completion of the scope of work under the PPF.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
(a)    Review of supporting documents. The Land Cadastre Expert should work with&#13;
identified Government counterparts to review the following documents in support&#13;
of the Registration Law; (i) inter-agency agreement on cooperation, (ii)&#13;
procedures for assigning cadastral numbers to real property, and (iii) revised&#13;
format and procedures for the state act for land.&#13;
(b)    Training programs. The Land Cadastral Expert will be responsible for designing&#13;
into the case-study portion of the program of training for staff of the Land&#13;
Committee, BTI offices and the Ministry of Construction material that addresses&#13;
their role in the new registration system, and highlights situations where land&#13;
cadastral issues duplicate the process of registration.&#13;
(c)    Assessment of existing cadastral maps. Review on a spot basis the quality of&#13;
cadastral maps currently available for the purposes of registration.  (The&#13;
Government is to complete an inventory of maps in the Project regions by the end&#13;
of December, 1996.)&#13;
(d)    Monitor implementation of the agreed cadastral numbering system for real&#13;
property.  Ensure that this work is moving forward on the basis of the&#13;
Government's agreed methodology, with priority attention given to those rayons&#13;
nominated to participate in the Pilot Project.&#13;
Automation Systems Specialist&#13;
27.          Implementation of the Pilot Project will begin on the basis of paper technology, but shift&#13;
gradually to an automated environment. The consultant team should include an Automation Specialist to&#13;
monitor progress in preparing for the introduction of the computerized system. Prior experience in the&#13;
countries of the former USSR and knowledge of Russian is a plus, though not required. The Automation&#13;
Specialist should spend approximately 1-2 month in country.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
(a)    Preparation of user-interface sofiware. Render necessary assistance in developing&#13;
the user-interface software. Ability to adapt this software to any automated&#13;
system to be procured must be ensured. Prior experience in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of user-interface software for registration in the countries of the&#13;
former USSR will be a major plus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                  Annex D&#13;
(b)    Installation of automated systems.  Review  with the TOG  plans for the&#13;
implementation of the automated registration system at the rayon and oblast level&#13;
and provide recommendations as necessary. Assess the adequacy of allocated&#13;
premises for implementation of the automated system, particularly at the rayon&#13;
level.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS&#13;
I. Legal and Administrative Training for Registrars and Other Professional Legal Staff&#13;
1.            Part one of this training program will provide targeted staff with a thorough background&#13;
in the existing legislative basis for registration of rights in land and real estate. The Registration Law will&#13;
be covered in detail. In addition, relevant sections of the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Law on&#13;
Mortgage of Real Estate, the Law on Privatization, and the Law on Land will be highlighted. Following&#13;
this, documents issued in support of the Registration Law will be covered. Particular attention will be&#13;
given to the Government Resolution on Registration Procedures. This training will provide understanding,&#13;
inter alia, of: (1) rights subject to registration; (2) basis for suspending registration; (3) basis for refusing&#13;
registration; (4) priority; (5) obligations, authority, and liability of the Registrar; (6) registration&#13;
documents and document management procedures; (7) inter-agency roles in the functioning of the&#13;
registration system. One week will be alloted for part one of this training.&#13;
2.            Part two of this training program will analyze case studies of interesting situations and&#13;
problems that will be encountered in administering the registration system, as indicated by the experience&#13;
of other countries. The case studies to be included will be determined jointly by the Ministry of Justice&#13;
and the foreign consultant team provided under the main consultant services contract, and will be selected&#13;
on the basis of their ability to highlight legal and procedural aspects of the Kazakstani registration system.&#13;
Participants will be provided with a hypothetical situation or problem and be asked to resolve it on the&#13;
basis of material provided in part one of the program. Interaction with the foreign consultants and results&#13;
of this portion of the training program will be used to identify remaining gaps in the set of documents&#13;
supporting the Registration Law. Two weeks will be alloted for part two of this training.&#13;
3.            A total of approximately 55 staff will take this training program as follows: 10 from the&#13;
Republican level, 10 from the oblast level, and 35 from the rayon level. The training will be conducted&#13;
in three groups, with the first group comprising the Republic and oblast level staff, and the rayon level&#13;
staff divided into two roughly equal groups. The total costs per person for both parts of this program are&#13;
estimated at US$700, for a total program cost of US$38,500.&#13;
II. Legal and Procedural Training for Operational Staff&#13;
4.            Training under this program will be oriented to staff of the registration offices and&#13;
corresponding land committee and architects' offices responsible for maintaining the data base and&#13;
interacting with clients and will similarly be broken into two parts, with the first focusing on the existing&#13;
legislative and procedural basis and the second providing case studies. Part one of this program will&#13;
cover the same topics as program I, providing background to the legislative basis for the registration&#13;
system, but will focus more attention on topics (6) and (7); registration documents and document&#13;
management procedures, and inter-agency roles in the functioning of the registration system. Participating&#13;
staff of the MOJ will be broken out into a subgroup which receives more intensive training in the form&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                                  Annex E&#13;
of the registration list, the registration book, and document handling procedures for the registration&#13;
offices. Staff of the SLC and MOC will form another sub-group and devote more time to procedures for&#13;
the transfer of information in the case of initial registration under the new system and their agencies'&#13;
longer term role in maintaining the land and building cadastres and providing this information to the&#13;
registration offices. Part one will require one week of training.&#13;
5.            Part two of this training will provide a review of topics covered under part one and&#13;
analysis of relevant case studies, to be developed jointly by the foreign consultants, the PIU, MOJ, SLC,&#13;
and MOC. These case studies should highlight in particular matters that can be handled by operational&#13;
staff and those that need to be referred to higher authority. They should also examine the specific&#13;
mechanisms for the transfer of information among participating agencies in a detailed step-by-step manner.&#13;
Part two will require two weeks of training.&#13;
6.            Approximately 340 staff will receive this training as follows: from the rayon level, 304&#13;
(140 MOJ, 104 SLC, and 60 MOC); from the oblast level, 28 (12 MOJ, 8 SLC, and 8 MOC); and from&#13;
the national level, 8 (4 MOJ, 2 SLC, and 2 MOC). The estimated average cost per person is US$725&#13;
for a total program cost of US$287,000.&#13;
III. Software Training&#13;
7.            Training will be provided in the software packages procured as part of the automated&#13;
registration system (both operating system and data base management software) and for the GIS software&#13;
procured as part of the map production component. This training will take place in the fall of 1997 to&#13;
coincide with delivery and installation of equipment and will be provided to staff of the State Land&#13;
Committee, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Construction at the rayon, oblast, and Republic&#13;
levels. Three separate courses will be offered for the operating system (OS) software; for programmers,&#13;
for systems administrators, and for users. Ten individuals will receive training in OS for programmers&#13;
at an estimated per person cost of US$1900. The systems administrator course will be provided to 47&#13;
staff at an estimated per person cost of US$1900. The course for OS users will also be provided to 47&#13;
staff at an estimated per person cost of US$500. The total estimated cost for training in OS is&#13;
US$131,800.&#13;
8.            The training in data base management software (DBMS) will be provided as follows:&#13;
systems analyst for 3 staff at an estimated per person cost of US$5250; DBMS programming for 8 staff&#13;
at an estimated cost of US$5250; an data base administration for 47 staff at an estimated cost of US$1850.&#13;
The total estimated cost for training in DBMS is estimated at US$144,700.&#13;
9.            Training in GIS software will be provided on a modest scale, commensurate with the scale&#13;
of the digital mapping activity under the project. A total of 8 staff of GosNPCzem will receive a basic&#13;
course at an estimated per person cost of US$400. Four staff will receive an expanded course at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$2000 per person. The total estimated cost for training in GIS software is&#13;
US$11,200.&#13;
10.           Training in the user-interface software (UIS) will be provided to 395 staff (180 from the&#13;
Ministry of Justice, 125 from the State Land Committee, and 90 from the Ministry of Construction) at&#13;
an estimated per person cost of US$400 for a total estimated cost of UIS training of US$158,000.&#13;
11.           Total costs for all software training is estimated at US$446,000.&#13;

            Kazakstan - Real Estate Registration Pilot Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Real Estate Registration Pilot
            Project s objective will be to support Kasakstan's
            effort to establish a national registration system of real
            estate rights and transactions, as mandated by the legally
            enforceable Presidential Decree.  This decree increases
            security for rights to land and real estate, facilitates
            transactions in land and real estate, and promotes credit
            systems development.  The project will also test the use of
            digital mapping for registration system support, and for
            current and long-term requirements for map production and
            revision.  The project comprises three components:  (1)
            institution building; (2) establishment of the registration
            system; and (3) map production.  The first component
            consists of developing a Project Implementation Unit,
            providing technical assistance in elaborating and testing
            aspects of the registration system, and implementing
            training programs.  The second component establishes the
            registration offices of the Ministry of Justice, defines
            linkages between those offices and the offices of the State
            Land Committee and the Ministry of Construction, locates
            premises   and hires staff, sets up procedures to enter and
            maintain information in the registry, designs office
            procedures and standard forms, and installs and tests
            database management practices.  The third component tests
            and elaborates map digitization on a pilot basis, trains
            staff, examines the economic costs and benefits of shifting
            from paper-based maps to electronic maps, and establishes a
            digitization center that will add parcel boundary
            information to these base maps.
