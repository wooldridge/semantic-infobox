&#13;
                 INTEGRATED FIDUCIARY SYSTEM ASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     A Fiduciary Systems Assessment (FSA) was carried out to evaluate the arrangements&#13;
relevant to the Operation and to determine whether they provide reasonable assurance that the&#13;
Operation funds will be used for their intended purpose. Taking into account the&#13;
improvements required and the agreement on the actions required to strengthen the systems&#13;
(which are reflected in the PAP), the overall fiduciary framework is considered adequate to&#13;
support the Operation management and to achieve the desired results.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Assessments have been carried out in five States through two consulting firms. PwC&#13;
was engaged to carry out assessments in West Bengal and Odisha, while E&amp;Y was engaged&#13;
for assessments in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. In SBM-G, a national&#13;
programme these five states [Low income states] have been considered a representative&#13;
sample. It is noted that the institutional and governance arrangements vary from state to state.&#13;
The assessments were carried out in the period prior to the full-fledged implementation of the&#13;
new SBM-G guidelines. Many of the findings of the assessment are being addressed under&#13;
the SBM-G&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Assessment of Operation fiduciary systems integrates findings in three areas:&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·    The procurement systems were assessed to determine the degree to which the&#13;
            planning, bidding, evaluation, contract award and contract administration&#13;
            arrangements and practices provide a reasonable assurance that the Program will&#13;
            achieve intended results through its procurement processes and procedures&#13;
       ï&#130;·    The financial management systems were assessed to determine the degree to&#13;
            which the relevant planning, budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow,&#13;
            financial reporting and auditing arrangements provide a reasonable assurance on&#13;
            the appropriate use of Operation funds and safeguarding of its assets; and&#13;
       ï&#130;·    The Operation was also assessed in how its governance systems handle the risks&#13;
            of fraud and corruption, including the use of complaint mechanisms, and how&#13;
            such risks are managed and mitigated in light of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s commitments&#13;
            under the Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in&#13;
            Program-for-Results Financing (Anti-Corruption Guidelines or ACGs).&#13;
&#13;
4.      Major issues thus identified in these five sample States are considered in the&#13;
following paragraphs, and will be addressed through PAP, and other technical assistance, and&#13;
thru addressing staffing needs followed by capacity building measures. Keeping in view that&#13;
procurements under the project include a large number of small value cases for construction&#13;
of individual household latrines (IHHLs), specific issues related to procurement of materials&#13;
and contracts for IHHLs have been examined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      The overall objective of the Operation is to accelerate efforts under SBM-G to&#13;
achieve universal sanitation coverage, enhance cleanliness and eliminate open defecation in&#13;
rural areas by leveraging Bank funds to incentivize performance of the states and, to increase&#13;
MDWS capacity to facilitate states in program implementation. Both the GoI and the states&#13;
&#13;
                                               1&#13;
&amp;#12;have demonstrated commitment to these objectives, and are updating policies and guidelines&#13;
for program implementation, allocating requisite financial resources and putting in place&#13;
systems and procedures to strengthen program implementation. The scope of the Bank&#13;
supported Operation consists of two primary categories of activities that are designed to&#13;
enhance: (i) sanitation improvement in rural areas; and (ii) institutional capacity&#13;
strengthening of MDWS in program management, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Each of these activity categories are summarized in Section II-D, and described in detail&#13;
within Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The proposed Operation will support the national program over a five year period&#13;
(2015-2020); coinciding with the timeframe of the national program1. The Operation&#13;
strengthen the institutional, technical, fiduciary, social and environmental areas of rural&#13;
sanitation delivery nationally. To this effect the Operation is expected to contribute&#13;
significantly to eliminating open defecation, and achieving and sustaining ODF in rural India.&#13;
The critical elements of behavior change, and improved institutional capacities are expected&#13;
to considerably improve the levels of performance at the state and local levels, and set in&#13;
motion a self-reinforcing cycle.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The projected investment of the national program is US$22 billion over the five year&#13;
period. GoI has already made an allocation of US$ 413 million for FY 2015-16 which&#13;
represents 20% of the estimated program costs in 2015-16. The Bank will finance US$ 1.5&#13;
billion, as IBRD loan over five years, accounting for about seven percent of the projected&#13;
SBM-G program costs.&#13;
&#13;
8.    The development objective for the Operation (hereinafter referred to as the â&#128;&#156;Program&#13;
Development Objective or â&#128;&#156;PDOâ&#128;&#157; is: to reduce open defecation in rural areas, and strengthen&#13;
MDWS capacity to manage the national SBM-G program.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The GOI has developed a Swachh Bharat Mission Guidelines (Gramin) which lays&#13;
down the broad principles for construction of IHHLs, Community Sanitary Complexes&#13;
(CSCs), Solid &amp; Liquid Waste Management and related procurements, the assessments&#13;
specifically covered procurement, operation, Rural Sanitary Marts (RSMs); Production&#13;
Centres (PCs); and role of GPs etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.     With due attention to the principles of public procurement i.e. economy, efficiency&#13;
,effectiveness, equal opportunity, transparency and accountability and in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank operation policy requirement to assess if the program systems provide&#13;
reasonable assurance that financing proceeds will be used for the intended purposes, a sample&#13;
fiduciary assessment was carried out in 5 States. In addition an earlier assessment carried out&#13;
for RWSS project in 6 Low income states was also referred. The present program&#13;
procurement systems were assessed in regard to procurement planning, processes and&#13;
procedures, controls and integrity, procurement capacity and contract administration. Based&#13;
on these assessment the most critical findings and proposed actions are as below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  While the National program has set targets to achieve a clean India by October 2nd, 2019, the program is expected to be&#13;
effective till the end of the financial year, i.e. March 31 st 2020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12;        ï&#130;·     Most procurements (IHHLs under category 1) are expected to be highly&#13;
              decentralised and each of very low value. The challenge for these therefore&#13;
              will not be for complexity of procurement, but for ensuring consistency,&#13;
              efficiency and monitoring this very large number of small value contracts, where&#13;
              applicable2.&#13;
        ï&#130;·     Fiduciary assessment of a sample of States has brought out that at this lowest&#13;
              rung of the decentralised procurement there is a need to bring in clarity on how&#13;
              budget and procurement plan are required to be linked, on accountability, on&#13;
              integrity of the process, on maintenance of records; and on quality control.&#13;
        ï&#130;·     The staff availability and its capacity to carry out procurement or provide support&#13;
              at decentralized level is limited.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Procurement arrangements vary widely amongst different States in respect of&#13;
applicable rules and regulations, the organisations involved in actual procurement,&#13;
governance and accountability arrangements, grievance handling and redressal systems,&#13;
disclosure of information, record keeping, procurement management information, capacity,&#13;
quality control, contract management etc. Many variations have been noted in the&#13;
procedures in construction of IHHLs like (a) procurement by individual beneficiaries from&#13;
suppliers/ shopkeepers through discussions; (b) procurement by Sarpanch and by GPs,&#13;
without quality check and without procurement records; (c) construction under the oversight&#13;
of Block/districts with GPs not having any significant role; (d) PCs acting as contractors; (e)&#13;
masons acting as material suppliers; (f) absence of contracts &amp; long delays in completion; (g)&#13;
RSMs also acting as contractors rather than as material sources; and (h) lack of inspection of&#13;
the final construction work etc. As a result the fundamental principle of public&#13;
procurement i.e transparency, economy, efficiency and equal opportunity gets diluted.&#13;
A comparative position of various items of â&#128;&#152;Procurement Considerations in Fiduciary&#13;
Assessmentâ&#128;&#153; in each of the five States in Table 4 gives an overview of current status of&#13;
related procurements in these States.&#13;
&#13;
12.     For most states procurement systems for Works and goods are covered under PWD&#13;
manual and Store purchase manual respectively. In addition there may be relevant&#13;
government orders issued from time to time. Since, procurement is a State subject, rules and&#13;
practices differ from State to State. Improved transparency of procurement processes at the&#13;
household/village level is reported in some places owing to the follow-up in spirit of&#13;
community processes advocated under the SBM-G.&#13;
&#13;
13.    Procurement under SBM (G) mostly includes civil works of small and medium size&#13;
(upgrading or new construction of water supply system and providing of sanitation facilities).&#13;
There are no large contracts valued at or above Operational Procurement Review Committee&#13;
(OPRC) thresholds (US$50 million for works; US$30 million for goods, US$20 million for&#13;
non-consulting services, and US$15 million for consultant services) under the Program. Most&#13;
procurements except for a few packages under Category 2, are expected to be highly&#13;
decentralised and low value, therefore skill development challenge will not be for complexity&#13;
of procurement, but for ensuring consistency, uniformity and monitoring this very large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 The SBM-G program aims at reduction in open defecation through changing behaviors and thus in spirit&#13;
advocates the construction of individual latrines by households themselves. Where such mobilization occurs&#13;
effectively, the program would pass on the incentive to the households on successful completion, precluding any&#13;
contracts by the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;number of small value contracts. Specific procurement methods that would be applicable to&#13;
the Program include open competitive bidding, direct contracting and shopping.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The assessment of the existing procurement systems and arrangements identified&#13;
certain areas of improvement which could directly or indirectly compromise the efficient&#13;
achievement of program objectives: rules and guidelines are spread across multiple&#13;
documents and circulars emphasizing need for comprehensive instruction for all steps of the&#13;
procurement process; lack of regulations for services; existence of entry barrier to&#13;
contractors; instances of excessive use of direct contracting or single source processes in a&#13;
non-transparent manner; non-application of Bank debarment/suspension lists which may&#13;
result in unacceptable contract awards to Bank debarred/ suspended firms or individuals;&#13;
need for alternative dispute resolution mechanism; lack of procurement planning; delays in&#13;
contract administration due to delayed allocation of budget or payments; non-availability of&#13;
standards for disclosure/transparency; absence of procurement information system, and&#13;
oversight over procurement process including procurement review and audit.&#13;
&#13;
15.     FSA recognizes that given the scale, the available time, volume, capacity limitations&#13;
and decentralized nature of the program there may be areas which will be addressed but may&#13;
not get fully mitigated&#13;
&#13;
16.     To address the above issues corresponding Program actions are proposed to be agreed&#13;
with the Government prior to Credit negotiations. To strengthen the Programâ&#128;&#153;s procurement&#13;
implementation capacity, several crucial measures should be adopted including additional&#13;
staffing, intensive training and hiring of qualified procurement/contract management support&#13;
consultants, and robust procurement audit. The Bank will also provide assistance and support&#13;
to the program implementation and will closely monitor the program procurement&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.     Financial management for the program is characterized by the dispersed nature of the&#13;
implementation arrangements, with added challenges of disparateness of the arrangements at&#13;
the state level. A common feature across the states is that a significant part [75-80 percent] of&#13;
the program funds are utilized by way of payments for individual household latrines (IHHLs),&#13;
some of which are routed through GPs, NGOs, RSMs, contractors etc.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The financial management systems at the national and state level are operational&#13;
albeit with several identified inefficiencies; These include an established budgetary&#13;
framework that ensures that adequate resources are allocated to departments and&#13;
implementing agencies. While there are some concerns noted in the findings of the&#13;
assessment over the timeliness of state share fund releases, there appears to be sufficient&#13;
predictability in the availability of resources for the implementation of the program. Basic&#13;
books of accounts are maintained at all levels, though significant internal control weaknesses&#13;
are noted from field observations (also confirmed in various state and program level&#13;
Comptroller &amp; Auditor General audit reports).&#13;
&#13;
19.     Under the SBM-G guidelines, formats have been prescribed for Utilization certificates&#13;
and annual statement of accounts. Variations were noted in the accounting and book-keeping&#13;
practices followed at the State level, particularly with reference to the treatment of fund&#13;
releases from state to districts, districts to blocks, blocks to GPs and other institutions.&#13;
Downstream financial management aspects such as fund utilization, financial reporting and&#13;
&#13;
                                               4&#13;
&amp;#12;audit assurance receive insufficient management attention. This accounting practice, coupled&#13;
with the risk of lapse of budgetary outlay, has created an in-built incentive for ministries to&#13;
`spendâ&#128;&#153; the budget at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Consequently, consolidation of the program level expends at the state and national&#13;
level poses several challenges. Monthly financial, and physical, performance reports are&#13;
uploaded at the block level in the central database maintained by MDWS; efforts to&#13;
triangulate the reported expend with the audited financial statements and the underlying&#13;
books of accounts indicate that the financial information available on website may not be&#13;
reliable or accurate. There are also concerns over the oversight and auditing arrangements,&#13;
partly on account of the dispersed nature of the institutional arrangements. These factors&#13;
considerably increase the financial management risk of the program for all levels of&#13;
stakeholders including the beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
21.     In defining the program content with respect to the strengthening of the financial&#13;
management systems for the program, key focus will be to (a) development of detailed&#13;
financial management guidelines as required, manuals and procedures, including establishing&#13;
benchmarks for internal controls and auditing arrangements at national and state level; (b)&#13;
enhancing the staffing for financial management and oversight function at national and state&#13;
level; (c) implementation of PFMS (Program Financial Management System) developed by&#13;
Controller General of Accounts under Ministry of Finance as agreed by the States, to monitor&#13;
and track the usage of central plan funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.     Institutional arrangements and governance structures for the Program are assessed as&#13;
adequate in all participating states. The new policy framework emphasizing sustained&#13;
behavior change and ODF communities is sound and aligned with international best&#13;
practices. The capacity of institutions and incentives of actors at all levels however needs to&#13;
be aligned with this new policy shift The institutional architecture for delivery is highly&#13;
decentralized, with defined roles and responsibilities at centre, state, district, block and GP&#13;
levels. Unlike previous sanitation programs, the SBM-G allows states the flexibility to design&#13;
their delivery mechanisms to fit the local context. However, as is the case with other&#13;
centrally-funded programs in India, the district remains the main delivery unit â&#128;&#147; working&#13;
through block support teams and GP functionaries.&#13;
&#13;
23.     At the national level the main tool for accountability is the monitoring system&#13;
developed by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, including physical and financial&#13;
progress through Periodical Progress Reports, Performance Review Committee meetings,&#13;
Area Officerâ&#128;&#153;s Scheme, District Level Monitoring and Vigilance and Monitoring Committees&#13;
at the State/District Level. However, this system will have to be strengthened to ensure that&#13;
the information provided is reliable, timely and verifiable.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Although implementation of the governance and accountability arrangements on the&#13;
ground varies from state to state, overall these systems provide good underpinnings for&#13;
improving transparency and accountability of the Program but they require to be further&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
25.    Vigilance systems. In general, the vigilance function of line departments is fulfilled&#13;
by a chief vigilance officer, and Vigilance Committees are also established at the Block, ZP&#13;
and GP levels with various degrees of effectiveness. This will need to be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
                                              5&#13;
&amp;#12;26.     Grievance redressal mechanisms are present in every state. However, in practice,&#13;
these systems would need to be strengthened so they are more accessible and complaints&#13;
properly registered, and managed. Electronic grievance redressal systems and 24x7 helplines&#13;
exist in some states (â&#128;&#156;Sanjog Helplineâ&#128;&#157; in Odisha, â&#128;&#156;Samparkâ&#128;&#157; portal in Rajasthan, â&#128;&#156;CM&#13;
Helplineâ&#128;&#157; in Madhya Pradesh) that allow for the identification and tracking of SBM-G related&#13;
complaints.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Transparency and social accountability. The identification of beneficiaries is&#13;
conducted by the GPs and the Block level coordinator is responsible for reporting of progress&#13;
and the verification of utilization certificates. In some states, such as Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
physical and financial progress is uploaded to an online system, but in most states such&#13;
information is not published or disclosed to beneficiaries/communities. Social audits are to be&#13;
conducted for SBM-G, but the detailed procedures have been developed only in some States,&#13;
e.g. Karnataka. The Right to Information Act (2005) is another accountability mechanism&#13;
available to citizens and in some states, such Odisha, the Department has established an RTI&#13;
cell which answers all SBM related enquiries. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have enacted&#13;
their own Right to Information legislation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;1.     The proposed PforR financing of the SBM (Gramin) by the World Bank requires an&#13;
assessment of the program fiduciary arrangements in accordance with the World Bank OP/BP&#13;
9.0 to determine the suitability of the application of the approach to this Program and to&#13;
mitigate the fiduciary risks of the proposed Program. This document contains the findings to&#13;
the integrated Fiduciary System Assessment (FSA) of the fiduciary framework of the&#13;
proposed Program.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Given that this is a PforR lending, the program will exclude activities that, involve&#13;
procurement of (i) works, estimated to cost US$50 million equivalent or more per contract,&#13;
(ii) goods, estimated to cost US$30 million equivalent or more per contract, (iii) non-&#13;
consulting services, estimated to cost US$20million equivalent or more per contract, and (iv)&#13;
consultant services, estimated to cost US$15million equivalent or more per contract.&#13;
&#13;
3.      FSA has evaluated capacity of relevant institutions to implement the proposed&#13;
program while providing adequate fiduciary assurance on the use of program funds. The&#13;
assessment highlighted several issues for which agreement on short term and medium term&#13;
solutions shall be reached with GoI.&#13;
&#13;
4.     FSA recognizes that given the scale, volume, capacity limitations and decentralized&#13;
nature of the program there may be areas which will be addressed but may not get fully&#13;
mitigated.&#13;
&#13;
5.     The fiduciary risk rating is considered to be high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      The proposed Operation provides support to the Swachh Bharat Mission â&#128;&#147; Gramin&#13;
(SBM-G) national program, the renewed rural sanitation program launched on October 2,&#13;
2014. The Program Development Objective is to reduce open defecation in rural areas, and&#13;
strengthen MDWS capacity to manage the national SBM-G program. The Operation is&#13;
designed to accelerate and sustain behavior change in rural households and villages â&#128;&#147;&#13;
stopping open defecation, using safe technologies and adopting hygienic behaviors - for more&#13;
than 60 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s rural population, thereby benefiting more than 550 million persons&#13;
by reducing open defecation by households, and benefitting a proportion thereof with the&#13;
collective gain of achieving and sustaining village-wide open defecation free status, and&#13;
increasing populations with solid and liquid wastes management. The Operation will be&#13;
implemented over a five year period, during 2016-2020.&#13;
&#13;
7.       The Program will use a set of DLIs to incentivize performance across institutional&#13;
tiers on sustained service delivery as well as create incentives for investments to attain and&#13;
retain the ODF status at the GP level. The Program will be coordinated and monitored by&#13;
MDWS at the national level, although implementation responsibilities will be with the state&#13;
governments. Each state will develop their implementation plans with appropriate&#13;
institutional arrangements to achieve the agreed results. All states have completed their first&#13;
yearâ&#128;&#153;s (FY 2015-16) Annual Implementation Plan (AIP) prioritizing an initial set of targets&#13;
and investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;Scope of the Program&#13;
&#13;
8.       The overall objective of SBM-G is to accelerate efforts to achieve universal sanitation&#13;
coverage, enhance cleanliness and eliminate ODF in rural areas. Both GoI and States have&#13;
demonstrated commitment to these objectives, and are updating policies and guidelines for&#13;
program implementation, allocating requisite financial resources and putting in place systems&#13;
and procedures to strengthen program implementation. The scope of the Bank supported&#13;
Operation consists of two categories of activities: (i) performance incentives for sanitation&#13;
improvement in rural areas; and (ii) strengthening institutional capacities on program&#13;
management, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation by MDWS. The indicative list of&#13;
activities to be supported under this category is summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
Category 1: Performance incentives for sanitation improvements in rural areas (PforR):&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Program will finance SBM-G program activities and operationalize the&#13;
performance based incentive grants to states based on the state reduction in the population&#13;
practicing open defecation, populations residing in villages that sustain ODF status, and the&#13;
rural population with SLWM. A set of DLIs for measuring reduction in open defecation&#13;
prevalence, sustainability of ODF status, and increased populations with SLWM are provided&#13;
in Section G and is detailed in Annex 3. The indicative list of activities to be supported under&#13;
this category are summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
         (a)    Construction and use of safe and functional individual household latrines&#13;
         (b)    Construction and use of functional community sanitary complexes&#13;
         (c)    Use and maintenance of school, anganwadi and public sanitation&#13;
         (d)    Construction of liquid waste management3 facilities and systems&#13;
         (e)    Establishment of solid waste management facilities and services&#13;
         (f)    Behavior change communication activities&#13;
&#13;
10.      The end use of the performance grant will be for any activity for sanitation&#13;
improvements under SBM-G. Approved activities will be detailed in the MDWS guidelines&#13;
for the Performance Incentive Grants Scheme to be issued to states. Illustrative items include&#13;
construction of improved household sanitation, community sanitation and public sanitation&#13;
facilities with water storage, rehabilitation of defunct toilets, construction and management of&#13;
solid and liquid waste collection and treatment systems, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
of sanitation facilities, and any item listed in the annual implementation plan of the districts&#13;
and states. The availability of these performance grants is expected to become an attractive&#13;
incentive for the states and their implementing tiers at the district, block and GP levels.&#13;
&#13;
Category 2: Strengthening institutional and implementing capacities on program&#13;
management, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation by MDWS. (IPF)&#13;
&#13;
11.     Program management capacity and coordination at the national level will be&#13;
strengthened by hiring key human resources in the PMU with the strategic purpose of&#13;
accelerating the pace of implementation. The indicative list of Category 2 activities to be&#13;
supported are:&#13;
3&#13;
 While fecal wastes are to be safely disposed of as a part of sanitation investments, liquid waste management shall mainly&#13;
comprise investments in systems for safe disposal of grey (non-fecal) wastewater, including sullage, storm-water, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            8&#13;
&amp;#12;       (a) Strengthening of the PMU, engaging a Program Management Consultant (PMC)&#13;
           within the PMU of MDWS&#13;
       (b) Strengthening program M&amp;E system at the national level&#13;
       (c) National third party annual sanitation surveys to cover all states and union&#13;
           territories&#13;
       (d) Establishment of a robust and credible verification mechanism for program results&#13;
       (e) Capacity building and trainings on thematic areas&#13;
       (f) Strengthening program governance and accountability systems&#13;
       (g) National level advocacy and behavior change communication activities&#13;
       (h) Learning and knowledge transfer&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
12.    The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS) is primarily responsible for&#13;
meeting the SBM-G goals. The Swachh Bharat Mission is set up at the MDWS with the&#13;
Secretary, MDWS as the Mission Director of SBM-G. The Joint Secretary in charge of the&#13;
SBM-G, is virtually the focal point for the national program in the Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
13.     In the five sample states the nodal institution is the Department of Panchayati Raj and&#13;
Rural Development (PRRD). Most States have established a State Water and Sanitation&#13;
Mission (SWSM), Communication and Capacity Development Unit (CCDU), and District&#13;
Water and Sanitation Missions (DWSM). An exception is West Bengal where the sanitation&#13;
program is being turned into a Mission Bharat Bengal. Policy guidelines are developed at the&#13;
State level whilst detailed planning and monitoring is being undertaken at the District and&#13;
Block level.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The proposed Operation shall be implemented by the existing institutional structures&#13;
at the national, state, district, block and GP levels for SBM-G. The MDWS shall carry out&#13;
program management nationally, and the nodal departments in the states shall be responsible&#13;
for implementation of the Program with districts as the base implementation unit with the&#13;
goal of creating ODF GPs. Key implementation responsibilities are outlined below and&#13;
reflect the national program guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
15.     National Level: The National SBM-G in the MDWS, headed by the Secretary as the&#13;
Mission Director, is the nodal agency for implementing the Program. The National Mission&#13;
shall comprise of specialized structures for strong program management including those for&#13;
Program coordination, steering, developing and issuing relevant guidelines and regulations,&#13;
planning, monitoring and evaluation, technical support, communications and knowledge&#13;
sharing. The National Mission is responsible for coordinating with other national Ministries,&#13;
especially the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), and Ministry of Women&#13;
and Child Development (MWCD), for implementation of SBM components for sanitation in&#13;
schools and anganwadis. The National Mission shall be responsible for carrying out&#13;
independent verification assessments as spelt out in the Program. The National Mission will&#13;
engage an Independent Verification Agency (IVA) that would include procurement process&#13;
verification with demonstrated capacity and independence in undertaking the verification role&#13;
executed in a timely and efficient manner. MDWS will prepare the consolidated results&#13;
reports and request for disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
16.     State Level: The primary responsibility for Program delivery lies with the state&#13;
governments. The State Swachh Bharat Missions â&#128;&#147; Gramin (SSBM-G), as registered society&#13;
in the nodal department, shall be responsible for implementing the Program in their States.&#13;
&#13;
                                              9&#13;
&amp;#12;The Principal Secretary of the nodal Department will be the State Mission Director and&#13;
Member Secretary. Overall, the implementation mechanism of the Program at the state level&#13;
will consist of (i) SSBM-G, (ii) District Swachh Bharat Mission â&#128;&#147; Gramin (DSBM-G), (iii)&#13;
Block Program Management Unit, and (iv) Gram Panchayat. In each of these states an Apex&#13;
Committee is expected to be set up, headed by the Chief Secretary to aid and advise the State&#13;
Mission.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The State Mission shall supervise the implementation of the Program in the districts&#13;
in the states, facilitate convergence among other departments, ensure preparation of the&#13;
Annual Implementation Plan (AIP) for each district according to a standard framework&#13;
incorporating elements of bottom-up planning (at the GP levels), and consolidate these plans&#13;
into the State AIP for presentation to and concurrence by the National SBM on an annual&#13;
basis. The State Plans shall have district wide plans consolidated for all GPs. Coordination&#13;
among various actors at the state level is particularly important to achieve the Program&#13;
results.&#13;
&#13;
18.      District Level: In each district, a DSBM-G will be formed. Although the nodal&#13;
department in the states will play a catalytic role in implementation of the Program, the role&#13;
of the District Collector / CEO of the District administration will be pivotal. District will be&#13;
the base implementation unit. District wide sanitation plans (district level AIPs) will be&#13;
formulated by consolidating the GP level ODF plans. Districts will be the implementation&#13;
unit for deployment of social mobilization, rolling out of behavior change interventions,&#13;
facilitating the marketing of products, trainings and capacity building. Monitoring of the&#13;
district level performance will be a crucial role of the District Mission.&#13;
&#13;
19.    Block Level: Blocks in the districts will set up Block Program Management Units&#13;
which will be a bridge between the districts and the Gram Panchayats. The Block Program&#13;
Management Unit will coordinate all activities for social mobilization, awareness generation,&#13;
motivation, facilitating supply chains and monitoring implementation status for a cluster of&#13;
GPs at the block level.&#13;
&#13;
20.    Gram Panchayats: GPs are responsible for the implementation of rural sanitation&#13;
program and shall endeavour in achieving ODF status. GPs are responsible to preparation of&#13;
GP level ODF plans, sensitize and motivate communities, constantly supervise and monitor&#13;
the implementation progress and monitor household behaviors. GPs may choose to set up&#13;
Village Water and Sanitation Committee and any other monitoring committee to supervise&#13;
the implementation at the village and ward level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.     The projected investment of the national program is US$22 billion over the five year&#13;
period. GoI has already made an allocation of US$ 413 million for FY 2015-16 which&#13;
represents 20% of the estimated program costs in 2015-16. The Bank will finance US$ 1.5&#13;
billion, as IBRD loan over five years, accounting for about seven percent of the projected&#13;
SBM-G program costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;22.     Notwithstanding the disparateness of the implementation arrangements noted across&#13;
the states, the financial management systems for the program have several common features&#13;
across the states. These include (a) annual planning processes based on baseline data; (b)&#13;
budgetary provisions at national and state level based on consolidated state annual plans; (c)&#13;
fund release protocols; (d) accounting systems at implementing agency level/s; and (e) annual&#13;
statutory audit at the implementing agency level.&#13;
&#13;
23.    As part of Program preparation and in accordance with OP/BP 9.00 Guidelines, a&#13;
Fiduciary Systems Assessment [FSA] for the Program has been conducted at national level&#13;
and in the States of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal to&#13;
determine whether the fiduciary systems provide reasonable assurance that Program&#13;
expenditures will be used for the intended purposes. The assessment findings are not likely to&#13;
be very different in other states and therefore, this assessment may be considered as a fair&#13;
representation of the fiduciary systems on the overall. The findings of the assessment are&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
24.     Planning and Budgeting: Annual planning processes are by and large in place;&#13;
annual plans are typically based on baseline data and assessed demand for IHHLs prepared at&#13;
the district level and consolidated for the state â&#128;&#147; block or village level plans were however&#13;
not seen in any of the states. The consolidated state annual plans form the basis for annual&#13;
budgets at the state and national levels. Medium terms strategic plans [for five years as per&#13;
SBM guidelines] are absent for some States. Evidence shows State program objectives are&#13;
consistent with the national development strategy.&#13;
&#13;
25.     The funds allocated for the program [erstwhile Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA)] at the&#13;
national level are reflected in the Union Budget in Demand for Grants Number 30, pertaining&#13;
to Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The routing of the program funds through the&#13;
State budget started from 2014-15 budgets. Starting from FY14-15, the State budget reflects&#13;
both central and State share of the program and include donor funded expenditures, where&#13;
applicable. Beneficiary share of the program costs [IHHLs etc.] are not captured in the&#13;
national or state budget. The preparation of budget and its approval in the Parliament [and&#13;
Legislative Assembly for the states], provisions for which are enshrined in the Constitution of&#13;
India, goes through legislative scrutiny and the Parliament exercises full control over the&#13;
annual budgetary system through this mechanism. The process of preparing the budget,&#13;
discussing it in Parliament, and its subsequent approval is considered as an effective&#13;
instrument of financial control of government activities.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Treasury and Fund flows: Fund releases are processed through Treasury into&#13;
separate bank accounts of State Water Missions [registered as societies] or directly into bank&#13;
accounts of District Missions [or Zilla Parishads, as the case may be] in instalments. SBM&#13;
guidelines require that the state releases the central and the corresponding state share into&#13;
bank accounts of State Mission within 15 days of the receipt of central share [delays invite&#13;
penal interest] and therein to the districts, block and village level implementing agencies.&#13;
Delays in transfer of funds at all levels and disconnects between fund releases and annual&#13;
implementation plans has however been a common problem across all states; this&#13;
significantly impacts the ability of the implementing agencies to plan and deliver against the&#13;
committed annual action plans. Under the SBM-G, the States have been provided the&#13;
flexibility to disburse funds to districts based on performance.&#13;
&#13;
27.    Transparency: Ministry/Departments budget allocations, budget execution reports,&#13;
year-end financial statements and audit reports are available at both national and state levels&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;on Government websites and are accessible to the public. Budget and financial statements are&#13;
voluminous and not in user friendly formats. Budget execution reports at national and state&#13;
levels report fund transfers and releases and do not necessarily reflect the complete program&#13;
expenditures in any meaningful form. SBM-G [earlier NBA] website provides financial&#13;
information on releases and expend at national and state levels. However, this data may be&#13;
incomplete as there are gaps in the reconciliation of expenditures reported in Utilization&#13;
Certificates [UCs] and/or annual audited financial statements of the various levels of&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Accounting and Financial Reporting: The aggregate monthly accounts prepared by&#13;
the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) for GoI and Comptroller &amp; Auditor General&#13;
Office [C&amp;AG] for States, compiled from the departmental accounts, provide monthly&#13;
accounts of budget implementation. The monthly accounts of the central government are&#13;
important in-year budget reports that are accessible to the general public through the website&#13;
of the CGA/State Finance departments. However, as stated earlier the quality of actual&#13;
expend reported at national and state levels are based on fund releases [for SBM-G] and&#13;
therefore, do not facilitate meaningful assessment of financial performance.&#13;
&#13;
29.      The budget classification system in India which takes into account the COFOG&#13;
functional classification system is consistent with the GFS manual of 1986 based on the cash&#13;
accounting system. The budget classification system as determined by C&amp;AG office is&#13;
uniformly applied across all Indian states. The budget classification system in India has&#13;
improved over the years to establish a uniform classification for the budget accounts and&#13;
plan, clear presentation of objectives and purposes of government expenditure in terms of&#13;
functions, programs and activities, bringing together all expenditures under appropriate&#13;
functional (major), program (minor), and activity (subhead) irrespective of the organization&#13;
administering it, and generating timely data for monitoring expenditure on programs and&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
30.     The accounting standards prescribed by the Government (President of India) on the&#13;
advice of the CAG, IGAS, are not fully aligned with the Cash IPSAS prescribed by the IFAC.&#13;
There are differences between Government Accounting system in India and cash basis IPSAS&#13;
relating to the structure, disclosures and basis of accounting. SBM-G guidelines provide only&#13;
for standard financial reports such as audit of SBM-G account, submission of Utilization&#13;
certification and Annual Statement of Accounts, to be followed at the state levels. None of&#13;
the states covered in the assessment have developed accounting and financial management&#13;
guidelines or manuals. Consequently, existing accounting systems of the implementing&#13;
agencies are used as a default position, Observations from field visits reveal that variable&#13;
accounting standards are applied, including treatment of fund releases and advances as&#13;
expend, multiplicity of bank accounts etc.&#13;
&#13;
31.     As per scheme guidelines, the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation has&#13;
developed an online monitoring system for TSC/ NBA. The TSC/ NBA project district is&#13;
required to submit physical and financial progress reports through this on line software&#13;
(IMIS) for which user-id and password have been generated and communicated by DDWS-&#13;
NIC cell. Efforts to triangulate the financial progress entered through the on line software&#13;
with Utilization Certificates [UCs] and audited financial statements submitted by the States&#13;
confirm that there are significant disconnects in the financial expend reported. Field visits&#13;
reveal large unspent balances at all levels which are not reflected in the financial statements&#13;
and in some States not considered as these have been reported earlier as expend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;32.     In line with the Government Financial Rules [State and Center] monitoring of&#13;
financial progress, including processing of fund releases is typically centered around&#13;
submission of Utilization Certificates on an annual basis. Utilization certificates are&#13;
submitted by the GP to the blocks and collated up to the district and State. GP level UCs are&#13;
required to be verified by Block level officials but due to manpower issues [1 block officer to&#13;
verify UCs of approximately 60 GPs] there is delay in processing of UCs, which adversely&#13;
affect the fund flows.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Annual financial statements are prepared at the level of the implementing agencies&#13;
[SWSMs, DWSMs, ZP, Block agencies and GPs]; there is albeit with significant delays.&#13;
SBM guidelines also require the States [SWSM] to prepare and submit annual program&#13;
audited financial statements incorporating receipts and expenditures of the districts and the&#13;
underlying implementing agencies. There is no record to show that systems are in place for&#13;
the implementing agencies below the district level to prepare and submit periodic financial&#13;
reports to the district.&#13;
&#13;
34.     A multi-year perspective in expenditure planning and budgeting has been lacking in&#13;
India. While the States have enacted the FRBM Act stipulating the requirement of Medium Term&#13;
Fiscal Policy (MTFP) detailed medium term expenditure framework for various sectors are not&#13;
worked out. The budgeting thus remains strictly annual without a multi-year perspective relating&#13;
to expenditure commitments of various sectors. In an effort to avoid lapsing of annual budgets&#13;
[applicable to departments, ZP etc. which use the Treasury systems] monies are drawn towards&#13;
the close of the financial year and parked in personal ledger accounts of the District officials&#13;
for use in the next financial year. For agencies [SWSM, DWSM, GPs etc.] that operate&#13;
outside the Treasury systems, the unspent balances in bank accounts roll over into the next&#13;
financial year.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Internal Controls, including Internal Audits: The internal control framework at&#13;
national and state levels are embodied in the Budget Manual, Financial Rules and Treasury&#13;
Code read with the Store purchase manual &amp; Works Manual and other related employee&#13;
rules. These rules contain principles covering budgeting, revenue and expenditure, delegation&#13;
of authority, accounting, procurement, pay, allowances and pensions, stores, works etc. The&#13;
control systems are applied consistently for expend processed through the Treasury systems&#13;
but get substantively diluted when the funds are transferred outside of the State systems [for&#13;
off-Treasury operations]. The off budget expend are not subject to Treasury controls nor are&#13;
the audited by C&amp;AG.&#13;
&#13;
36.      Field visits reveal that some level of internal audits are carried out as part of the&#13;
institutional systems at ZP, PS and GP levels [MP, Chhattisgarh], albeit with significant&#13;
delays. Internal audits where undertaken, typically focuses on transactions and is constrained&#13;
by significant staff vacancies. Payroll controls are fairly robust for payments through&#13;
Treasury systems; these controls however, do not extend to program staff engaged on&#13;
contractual basis. SBM-G finances minimal levels of capital assets, limited to office&#13;
furniture, computers etc. at SWSM, DWSM, ZPs, PS and GP levels, which are typically&#13;
subject to asset management systems at the level of the individual agencies. There is no&#13;
evidence of planning for cash flows; review meetings are however conducted routinely to&#13;
assess the progress, reasons for non-performance, and delays in submission of UCs etc. These&#13;
meetings are held at State level with all the CEOs of the districts present and also at the&#13;
district level with all the BDO of the blocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              13&#13;
&amp;#12;37.     Program Audit: Auditing arrangements are typically fragmented across the various&#13;
implementing institutions and vary across the states. Agencies operating outside of the State&#13;
Treasury systems are audited by CA firms [empaneled by C&amp;AG], ZPs, PS and GPs are&#13;
audited annually by CA firms and/or Local Fund Auditors [LFA] operating under the State&#13;
Finance Departments. Some of the common findings across districts include (i) the books of&#13;
account have not been properly prepared by the accountant; (ii) Bank statement is not&#13;
maintained for different schemes; (iii) advances are disbursed to staff through cash/bearer&#13;
cheque and the expenditure being incurred by staff in cash and advances may be unadjusted&#13;
since long period of time; and (iv) compliance of previous year audit objection has not been&#13;
produced for verification.&#13;
&#13;
38.     C&amp;AG conducts performance audits for select states at periodic intervals. The&#13;
performance audit of TSC/NBA covering period 2009-14 was carried out in selected districts,&#13;
Gram Panchayats and Villages. Implementation of TSC/NBA revealed serious irregularities&#13;
viz., deficiency in planning, improper fund management, inadequate awareness campaigning&#13;
through Information Education Communication (IEC) activities, lack of monitoring,&#13;
supervision and social audit. Besides, instances of idling of expenditure, fraudulent drawl,&#13;
bogus construction and suspected misappropriation of funds were also noticed.&#13;
&#13;
39.    Strengthening Financial Management Systems: In defining the program content&#13;
with respect to the strengthening of the financial management systems for the program, key&#13;
focus will be to (a) development of detailed financial management guidelines, manuals and&#13;
procedures, including establishing benchmarks for internal controls and auditing&#13;
arrangements at national and state level; (b) enhancing the staffing for financial management&#13;
and oversight function at national and state level; (c) implementation of PFMS (Program&#13;
Financial Management System) developed by Controller General of Accounts under Ministry&#13;
of Finance as agreed by States, to monitor and track the usage of central plan funds.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement &amp; Contract Management&#13;
&#13;
       (a) Procurement profile: At the State level major procurement activities shall&#13;
           comprise of works and related material inputs at the Block level or village level&#13;
           by the GPâ&#128;&#153;s or individual beneficiaries. Some of works like CSC or SLWM and&#13;
           related procurement may be procured at the State and District levels,&#13;
            Major activities at central level would be those required for institutional&#13;
            strengthening of MDWS. This includes (i) procurement of certain key&#13;
            consultancies, as required; (ii) capacity building, staffing and training; (iii)&#13;
            strengthening MDWSâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to provide program management and technical&#13;
            support to states; (iii) strengthening program M&amp;E system at the national level,&#13;
            and program oversight, governance and accountability systems; (iv) setting up&#13;
            of evaluation unit in MDWS; etc..&#13;
&#13;
       (b) Table G â&#128;&#152;Procurement Considerations in Fiduciary Assessmentâ&#128;&#153; in the five States&#13;
           presents the existing procurement arrangements in five sample states and&#13;
           establishes the following main gaps:&#13;
&#13;
         (i)     Procurement planning &amp; linkage to budget â&#128;&#147; Departments prepare&#13;
                 budget estimates but there is no practice of preparation of procurement&#13;
                 plans with details of timeline, estimates and quantities. Moreover, the State&#13;
                 AIP is prepared based on AIPs of the districts but without block level AIPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             14&#13;
&amp;#12;                    Proposed Mitigation: MDWS issues guidance to all States to direct&#13;
                    Districts to prepare their procurement plan in consultation with the&#13;
                    concerned GPâ&#128;&#153;s. Procurement plans must be prepared based on the&#13;
                    availability of project funding. Procurement packaging shall be done based&#13;
                    on technical nature and implementation sequence to ensure economy,&#13;
                    efficiency and equal opportunity for prospective bidders. MDWS shall&#13;
                    prepare a consolidated procurement plan covering individual packages to&#13;
                    be procured at the Central level and procurements under broad categories&#13;
                    which are to be carried out at the decentralized levels. The procurement&#13;
                    plan will be updated at least annually or earlier, if required.&#13;
&#13;
           (ii)     Applicable procurement rules and proceduresâ&#128;&#147;rules, guidelines and&#13;
                    procedures vary from State to State, and in many cases the procedures are&#13;
                    not available at one place for ready reference. No guidelines/standardised&#13;
                    documents are in place for procurement of services.&#13;
&#13;
           (iii)    Village level procurement4 being of low value does not always follow a&#13;
                    formal system and makes it susceptible to unacceptable practices, lack of&#13;
                    transparency and discretionary decision making. Thereby curtailing&#13;
                    participation of any new prospective bidders. The procurement procedure&#13;
                    followed at this level varies very widely amongst the States. In some places&#13;
                    RSMs and PCs are used; RSMs also act as contractors rather than as&#13;
                    material sources; work is allotted to RSMs on informal basis through mutual&#13;
                    agreement; RSMs also get empanelled through self-application process;&#13;
                    RSMs have become dysfunctional at some places; procurements are being&#13;
                    made from open market in parallel with RSMs even where RSMs are&#13;
                    operational.&#13;
&#13;
           (iv)     Variations have been noted in the procedures used like (a) procurements by&#13;
                    individual beneficiaries and procurement of materials from suppliers/&#13;
                    shopkeepers through discussions, with no quotations and with no contracts&#13;
                    (b) procurement is by Sarpanch or GP; standard formats for quotations are&#13;
                    not used, there are no contracts for supply of materials; there is no quality&#13;
                    check for delivered goods; sub-engineer inspects the final construction&#13;
                    work; (c) procurement is by GPs; there is no contract with GP; there is no&#13;
                    check on quality of goods delivered; and procurement registers are not&#13;
                    maintained; (d) in some places construction of IHHLs is being done under&#13;
                    the oversight of Block/districts and GPs do not have significant role; (e)&#13;
                    PCs are acting as contractors taking up construction of IHHLs; and (f) in&#13;
                    some places masons are acting as material suppliers; and (g) there are cases&#13;
                    of absence of contracts &amp; long delays in completion etc.&#13;
&#13;
                    Proposed Mitigation: To ensure transparency, economy, efficiency and&#13;
                    equal opportunity (a) Mandate open competitive bidding as the default&#13;
                    procurement method and provide procedure for open competitive bidding;&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
 The SBM-G program aims at reduction in open defecation through changing behaviors and thus in spirit&#13;
advocates the construction of individual latrines by households themselves. Where such mobilization occurs&#13;
effectively, the program would pass on the incentive to the households on successful completion, precluding any&#13;
contracts by the program for IHHL.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      15&#13;
&amp;#12;         (b) Guidelines for Procurement will help formalise procurement process for&#13;
         SBM and provide guidance on maintenance of records; (c) put in place&#13;
         framework for procurement monitoring and oversight thru Independent&#13;
         Verification Agency (IVA); (d) make available guidance on generating MIS&#13;
         for overall management control; and (e)provide sanctions against&#13;
         unacceptable practices including fraud and corruption. These will be&#13;
         included in the Guidelines and will help in streamlining the processes and&#13;
         quality of procurement.&#13;
&#13;
(v)      Dispute resolution and Grievance Redressalâ&#128;&#147;grievance redressal is&#13;
         understandably handled differently in various States, but it is noted that in&#13;
         some States it is not a robust monitoring and redressal system and in one&#13;
         case it is largely informal. No alternative dispute resolution procedure or&#13;
         written process for complaint handling mechanism exists besides&#13;
         Jurisdiction Avenue during bidding process. The assessment did not come&#13;
         across any complaint documentation.&#13;
&#13;
         Mitigation: Implement a robust grievance monitoring and redressal system&#13;
         for complaints handling and for combating Fraud and Corruption and set&#13;
         up a mechanism so that lists of firms and individuals debarred/ temporarily&#13;
         suspended by the Bank are made available to procuring entities,&#13;
&#13;
(vi)     Bidding documents including e-procurementâ&#128;&#147; presently there are no&#13;
         standard documents being used by the States .it is noted that eProcurement&#13;
         platform developed and deployed by National Informatics Centre is being&#13;
         used by some States while others have their own service provider. It is&#13;
         assumed that all IA will have the required infrastructure and associated&#13;
         action (such as training and capacity building of procurement staff to&#13;
         undertake e-procurement.&#13;
&#13;
         Proposed Mitigation: States issue guidance as required, as outlined in the&#13;
         Guidelines for use of Model bidding documents including forms and&#13;
         templates of contract and bid evaluation for use by procurement officials.&#13;
         The contracts shall have key conditions and terms such as performance&#13;
         security, insurance, advance payment and progressive payments,&#13;
         completion dates, liquidated damages, provision for contract variation,&#13;
         dispute resolution, warranty obligations, etc.&#13;
(vii)    Registration of contractor -is a prerequisite condition to be fulfilled for&#13;
         participation in bidding process, which may act as barrier and restrict many&#13;
         bidders from participating. Similarly criteria for selection of sanitary marts&#13;
         in some places is non-transparent and discretionary which will be an&#13;
         impediments to transparency and equal opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
         Proposed Mitigation: Registration to be continuously open to all&#13;
         prospective bidders/suppliers, as outlined in the Guidelines, and is linked&#13;
         only to capacity and capability.&#13;
&#13;
(viii)   Staffing and capacity - At district/GP level as large number of works&#13;
         contracts are to be handled. However, e significant capacity constraints&#13;
         for efficient and transparent procurement and oversight are noted. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      16&#13;
&amp;#12;       crucial to strengthen the capacity of key staff in dealing with procurement,&#13;
       contract management, oversight, training &amp; record keeping&#13;
&#13;
       Proposed Mitigation: States to prepare and implement strategy for&#13;
       adequate staffing followed by strengthening capacity of key staff on&#13;
       procurement, contract management, record keeping, oversight, training,&#13;
       quality control, transparency thru regular trainings and other support&#13;
       systems.&#13;
&#13;
(ix)   Internal/External controls â&#128;&#147; in the highly decentralized system of&#13;
       procurement envisaged under the project, effective controls both internal&#13;
       and external are of paramount importance. Aspects that contribute to these&#13;
       controls include (a) internal audit; (b) clear schedule of powers; (c) clearly&#13;
       defined accountability; (d) quality control; and (e) availability of complete&#13;
       procurement records. These issues are handled differently in various states&#13;
       and it is noted that in some States systems related to these aspects are not&#13;
       robust. For example it is seen from the assessments in 5 States that at some&#13;
       places there is no internal audit; there is no audit at GP level; there is no&#13;
       clear schedule of powers; accountability is not clearly defined; there is&#13;
       limited quality control; records are not maintained etc. A separation of&#13;
       functions for independently assessing and ensuring integrity of the process&#13;
       and system is required to be put in place. Further, there is need to strengthen&#13;
       the verification of procurement to determine adherence to agreed guidelines,&#13;
       procurement processes and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
       Proposed Mitigation: Introduce relevant provisions in the Guidelines as&#13;
       required, for Procurement laying down procedures, schedule of powers,&#13;
       responsibilities and implementing independent procurement verification,&#13;
       and proper record keeping.&#13;
&#13;
(x)    Dispute resolution system â&#128;&#147;disputes do arise. It is noted from the&#13;
       assessments in 5 States that in the contracts for RSMs and NGOs and&#13;
       presumably in the large number of decentralised procurements there are no&#13;
       formal dispute resolution mechanisms in place.&#13;
&#13;
       Proposed Mitigation: It would be necessary to lay down in the Guidelines&#13;
       for Procurement that if beneficiaries, NGOs, RSMs etc. have any issues,&#13;
       how these will be reported to State/ District/ Block and resolved in a&#13;
       transparent and unbiased manner, and their implementation monitored&#13;
       through the MIS and post reviews&#13;
&#13;
(xi)   Contract Management â&#128;&#147; management of contracts is essential for&#13;
       satisfactory construction activity even if the contracts are of small value, as&#13;
       otherwise it can easily lead for example to non-functioning IHHLs and&#13;
       creeping in of unacceptable non-transparent practices. It is noted from the&#13;
       assessments in the 5 States that at some places work order terms and&#13;
       conditions are flouted, there are time overruns, there is shortage of sub-&#13;
       engineers to supervise and lack of procurement staff at block and district&#13;
       levels. Terms and conditions in work orders issued to RSMs and NGOs are&#13;
       not enforced. It has also been noted in some cases that there is not even a&#13;
       signed contractual agreement, which could at least be sought to be enforced.&#13;
&#13;
                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;                  Proposed Mitigation: Introduce suitable provisions regarding&#13;
                  accountability and responsibility in the Guidelines for Procurement, and&#13;
                  provision of adequate technical and procurement staff as required.&#13;
&#13;
         (xii)    Procurement Management Information System (PMIS)â&#128;&#147;absence of&#13;
                  procurement management information has been noted in almost all States&#13;
                  studied. Information related to the procurement plan, procurement process&#13;
                  followed, information in regard to responsive supplier/bidder, and&#13;
                  performance monitoring of contractor/supplier is not organized or&#13;
                  consolidated at the district or state level to help make appropriate&#13;
                  management decisions. Procurement related information such as&#13;
                  procurement/ financial progress, biddersâ&#128;&#153; participation, price comparison,&#13;
                  and contractorâ&#128;&#153;s performance etc. is not captured for management review&#13;
                  and decision making. E-procurement system wherever cleared and&#13;
                  implemented would have provision for such MIS reports and tender-wise&#13;
                  information for various departments to monitor procurement at the central&#13;
                  level.&#13;
&#13;
                  Proposed Mitigation: Introduce a functioning PMIS for planning and&#13;
                  monitoring such a highly decentralised program, as per provisions in the&#13;
                  Guidelines. The utility of such a PMIS could be assessed through pilots in&#13;
                  some States/Districts.&#13;
&#13;
         (xiii)   Disclosure of information â&#128;&#147; the assessment has brought out that the extent&#13;
                  of public disclosure of information on the outcome of the procurement&#13;
                  process, varies from State to State. There is a need for guidelines that&#13;
                  promote consistent practices across board for disclosure of contract award&#13;
                  information. The states would needs to formulate and implement a&#13;
                  disclosure policy for procurement, such as contract award, achievement of&#13;
                  targets and expenditures, at various levels to maintain transparency in the&#13;
                  system.&#13;
&#13;
                  Proposed Mitigation: The Guidelines for Procurement shall provide&#13;
                  information on method, content and timing of such disclosure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.     The main mitigation tools to mitigate the Fraud &amp; Corruption risk under SBM is a&#13;
robust monitoring systems that provides reliable, timely and verifiable information about&#13;
financial and physical progress, and social audits that validate such information on the&#13;
ground.&#13;
&#13;
41.    Monitoring and Accountability systems: At the national level, the Ministry of&#13;
Drinking Water and Sanitation has developed a comprehensive system of monitoring the&#13;
implementation and impact of the Program including utilization of funds, through Periodical&#13;
Progress Reports, Performance Review Committee meetings, Area Officerâ&#128;&#153;s Scheme, District&#13;
Level Monitoring and Vigilance and Monitoring Committees at the State/District Level.&#13;
Physical and financial progress is being uploaded on monthly bases on the MDWS&#13;
monitoring system under NBA. Periodic review meetings are to be conducted to review the&#13;
physical and financial progress in the implementation of schemes in the states. Besides&#13;
review meeting, video conferencing is also to be organized to review progress of NBA/SBM-&#13;
&#13;
                                             18&#13;
&amp;#12;G and suggest corrective measures where required to achieve physical and financial&#13;
objectives. Field visits are also to be made by the officers of the Ministry to review the&#13;
implementation of sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
42.     M&amp;E Framework proposed under SBM-G: The monitoring framework proposed&#13;
under SBM-G will involve Annual Monitoring Survey. This needs to be done through a&#13;
process initiated at the national level, focusing on a 3rd Party independent monitoring of the&#13;
sanitation status in rural areas across the countryThe MDWS initiated a third party annual&#13;
survey through the services of the national Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) in 2015. The&#13;
MDWS is currently preparing for annual third-party national surveys of key program&#13;
indicators in the remaining years.&#13;
&#13;
43.     Concurrent monitoring: Concurrent monitoring of the implementation of the Program&#13;
has also been proposed, ideally using community level participation. This should ideally use&#13;
Information and Communications Technology (ICT), to feed data into the SBM-G â&#128;&#147;MIS. The&#13;
data of such monitoring is to serve as the main source of information for the Mission&#13;
Directorates and the RALU at various levels.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Monitoring and Evaluation Cell under SBM-G: SBM-G envisages the setting up of a&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Cell which shall be responsible for carrying out relevant and&#13;
suitable annual or biannual Monitoring exercises of the implementation of the SBM-G in&#13;
States, in consultation with other agencies like NSSO and Registrar General of India. The&#13;
Cell shall be responsible for coordination with States and Districts on Monitoring. The Cell&#13;
shall also monitor the reports and publications being brought out by various agencies and&#13;
organizations regarding the changing sanitation situation in the country. The Cell will also&#13;
have the responsibility of monitoring the activities of all other Ministries of Government of&#13;
India and individual States / UTs with respect to the Swachh Bharat Mission. Guidance is this&#13;
respect is already framed as part of SBM-G guidelines. The Cell will work towards&#13;
developing and strengthening of the SBM-G-MIS of the Ministry in coordination with the&#13;
NIC.&#13;
&#13;
45.     Independent Agencies for concurrent monitoring: SBM-(G) guidelines permit the use&#13;
of independent agencies/CSOs/NGOs for the concurrent monitoring of the program. The&#13;
Central and State Missions are allowed the liberty to engage such agencies with experience in&#13;
monitoring activities and having presence in the respective States, for this purpose.&#13;
Independent 3rd party evaluations of the program including procurement function could also&#13;
be carried out at Central and State levels.&#13;
&#13;
46.    Social Monitoring: Social audits are to be conducted for SBM-G, but the procedures&#13;
have been developed only by a few States, e.g. Karnataka.&#13;
&#13;
47.    Vigilance function: At the national level, there is a Central Vigilance Commission&#13;
(CVC) which is the apex governmental body to address governmental corruption. It is an&#13;
autonomous body, free of control from any executive authority and plays a key role in&#13;
advising various authorities in central Government organizations in planning, executing,&#13;
reviewing and reforming their vigilance work.&#13;
&#13;
48.    Other vigilance and anti-corruption mechanism at the program level include the Anti-&#13;
Corruption Bureau and its state level constituent bodies; which enforces the Prevention of&#13;
Corruption Act, 1988, financial and performance audits by the Comptroller and Auditor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             19&#13;
&amp;#12;General (C&amp;AG) of India, Right to Information Act, 2005 and the various state and&#13;
departmental level vigilance and grievance redressal systems.&#13;
&#13;
Odisha&#13;
&#13;
49.     At the state level, there is a State Level Vigilance structure which investigates and&#13;
advices on corruption related to government servants. The nodal agency for checking&#13;
corruption in Odisha is Odisha State Vigilance Directorate. It deals with complaints of&#13;
corrupt practices against officers. It is headed by Director General of Police, Vigilance and&#13;
assisted by three Inspector Generals of Police. The State vigilance department is divided into&#13;
six divisions. All six divisions are headed by a Superintendent of Police (SP). In RDD, a&#13;
representative of Odisha Vigilance Directorate is nominated, who looks after corruption&#13;
issues in the department. There is also an RTI Cell set up within the department, which&#13;
answers all RTI related enquiries.&#13;
&#13;
50.     In addition, Government of Odisha has launched online grievance redressal&#13;
mechanism â&#128;&#156;e-Abhiyoga/ Centralized Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System&#13;
(CPGRAMS)â&#128;&#157; developed by National Informatics Centre. Through this portal, Citizens are&#13;
encouraged to lodge their complaints. Once a complaint is lodged, it is either submitted to&#13;
Office of the Chief Minister, Government of Odisha, or to respective departments for&#13;
appropriate action. All offices till Tehsil are connected through this portal. The citizen can&#13;
also view action status of the complaint made through this portal. In order to make the portal&#13;
more users friendly, it also provides user manuals for different kinds of users, bifurcated into&#13;
department users and district users. There is also a 24 hour helpline to register complaints.&#13;
&#13;
51.     Grievance Redressal system - An electronic Integrated Grievance Redressal System&#13;
namely Sanjog Helpline has been implemented in the Rural Development Department. It is&#13;
an IT solution to handle public grievances. It informs about the grievance of people to the&#13;
right authority in real time through SMS, e-mail and fax. A dedicated toll-free telephone i.e.&#13;
1800-345-6770/155335 has been installed. Through this telephone, any person can register&#13;
his complain on water supply &amp; sanitation and PMGSY works undertaken by this&#13;
department. A consolidated report is sent via email and fax to the concern department at the&#13;
end of the day for the reference.&#13;
&#13;
West Bengal&#13;
&#13;
52.     The state Government has set up a Vigilance Commission headed by the Vigilance&#13;
Commissioner. There is a Vigilance Cell within the Personnel and Administrative Reforms&#13;
(P&amp;AR) Department that is entrusted with the practices and procedures of disciplinary rules&#13;
in relation to the Government servants, belonging to the administrative and disciplinary&#13;
control of this department. As Cadre Controlling Authority of I.A.S., W.B.C.S. &amp; West&#13;
Bengal General Service Officers the P &amp; A.R. Department ensures, through Vigilance Cell,&#13;
the duties and obligations of its officers in pursuance of prescribed Service Conduct Rules,&#13;
and initiates disciplinary actions for violation of such prescribed conduct by the officers&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
53.     At Department level, there is a designated vigilance officer who looks into matters&#13;
related to the department in consultation with the State Vigilance Commission. There is an&#13;
RTI Cell within each department which receives and disposes off RTI applications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.0                                             Procurement Processes and Procedures [Specific to Procuring Entities]&#13;
&#13;
       Decentralized procurement at village level being of low value does not always follow a formal system and makes it susceptible to unacceptable practices,&#13;
       lack of transparency and discretionary decision making. The procurement procedures followed at this level vary very widely amongst the States. In some&#13;
       places RSMs and CPs are used; RSMs also act as contractors rather than as material sources; work is allotted to RSMs on informal basis through mutual&#13;
       agreement; RSMs get empanelled through self-application process; RSMs have become dysfunctional at some places; procurements are being made from&#13;
       open market in parallel with RSMs even where RSMs are operational.&#13;
       Other variations noted in the procedures used include (a) procurements by individual beneficiaries and procurement of materials from suppliers/&#13;
       shopkeepers through discussions, with no quotations and with no contracts (b) procurement by Sarpanch who also acts as the contractor; (c) procurement&#13;
       by GPs; there is no check on quality of goods delivered; and procurement registers are not maintained; (d) construction of IHHLs under the oversight of&#13;
       Block/districts and GPs do not have significant role; (e) PCs acting as contractors and taking up construction of IHHLs; and (f) masons acting as material&#13;
       suppliers; and (g) absence of contracts &amp; long delays in completion etc.&#13;
       Hand holding support at the village level is often not available from competent ZP/district/HQ staff, and extent of defunct toilets is quite high in most&#13;
       states assessed.&#13;

      In the highly decentralized system of procurement envisaged under the program, effective controls both internal and external are of paramount importance.&#13;
      Aspects that contribute to these controls include (a) internal audit; (b) clear schedule of powers; (c) clearly defined accountability; (d) quality control; (e)&#13;
      availability of complete procurement records; and (f) an effective grievance redressal system. These issues are handled differently in various states but it is&#13;
      noted that in some States systems related to these aspects are not robust. For example it is seen that at some places there is no internal audit; there is no&#13;
      audit at GP level; there is no clear schedule of powers; accountability is not clearly defined; there is limited quality control; quotations are not collected;&#13;
      records are not maintained; grievance redressal is largely informal etc. A separation of functions for independently assessing and ensuring integrity of the&#13;
      process is required to be put in place.&#13;
      The extent of public disclosure of information on the outcome of the procurement process varies from State to State and there is a need to promote some&#13;
      consistency in disclosure of contract award information.&#13;

      Management of contracts is essential for satisfactory construction activity even if the contracts are of small value, as otherwise it can easily lead for&#13;
      example to non-functioning IHHLs and creeping in of unacceptable non-transparent practices. It is noted that at some places work order terms and&#13;
      conditions are flouted, there are time overruns, there is shortage of sub-engineers to supervise, and lack of procurement support at block and district levels.&#13;
      Terms and conditions in work orders issued to RSMs and NGOs are not enforced. Sometimes there is not even a signed contractual agreement, which&#13;
      could be sought to be enforced.&#13;
      Absence of procurement management information has been noted in almost all States studied. Information related to the procurement is not organized or&#13;
      consolidated at the district or state level to help make appropriate management decisions, and needs to be organized. E-procurement system wherever&#13;

      between strategic plans, the     India provide the basis for a multi-year perspective for resource allocation. However, the economic planning and budget differ in&#13;
      budget, and medium-term          their scope and time span. While plans provide a conceptual framework by focusing on various sectors in the economy, the budget is&#13;
      financial planning?              more concerned with systems of control over the use of funds by government and pays more attention to financial aspects. Further,&#13;
                                       in the context of current budgetary practice, the link between the plan and the budget is weak. In the process of budget preparation&#13;
                                       the plan allocations are dispersed over various heads and sub-heads of expenditure.&#13;

      financial planning?              more concerned with systems of control over the use of funds by government and pays more attention to financial aspects. Further,&#13;

            India - Swachh Bharat mission support
            operation (program-for-results) : fiduciary systems assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A fiduciary systems assessment (FSA) was
            carried out to evaluate the arrangements relevant to the
            operation and to determine whether they provide reasonable
            assurance that the operation funds will be used for their
            intended purpose. Taking into account the improvements
            required and the agreement on the actions required to
            strengthen the systems (which are reflected in the program
            action plan (PAP), the overall fiduciary framework is
            considered adequate to support the operation management and
            to achieve the desired results. Assessments have been
            carried out in five states through two consulting firms.
            PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Limited (PwC) was engaged to
            carry out assessments in West Bengal and Odisha, while Ernst
            and Young Limited (E and Y) were engaged for assessments in
            Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The overall
            objective of the operation is to accelerate efforts under
            swachh Bharat mission gramin (SBM-G) to achieve universal
            sanitation coverage, enhance cleanliness, and eliminate open
            defecation in rural areas by leveraging Bank funds to
            incentivize performance of the states and, to increase
            ministry of drinking water and sanitation (MDWS) capacity to
            facilitate states in program implementation. The proposed
            operation will support the national program over a five year
            period (2015-2020); coinciding with the timeframe of the
            national program. To strengthen the program’s procurement
            implementation capacity, several crucial measures should be
            adopted including additional staffing, intensive training,
            and hiring of qualified procurement and contract management
            support consultants, and robust procurement audit. The Bank
            will also provide assistance and support to the program
            implementation and will closely monitor the program
            procurement performance.
