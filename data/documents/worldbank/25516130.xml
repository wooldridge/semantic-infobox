                          Executive summary&#13;
                          Poverty continues to decline, Lao PDR met the MDG target of halving extreme poverty&#13;
&#13;
                          a)	 Poverty in Lao PDR declined from 33.5 percent to 23.2 percent over the 10 year period between&#13;
                              2002/3 and 2012/13. The number of poor people declined by about half a million to 1.35 million&#13;
                              in 2013 and Lao PDR has met its MDG target of reducing poverty to below 24 percent by 2015.&#13;
                              Improvements in welfare are evident in the changes in other socio-economic indicators such as the&#13;
                              ownership of televisions and access to electricity, which doubled, and the number of households&#13;
                              living in houses built with bricks or concrete, which nearly tripled, while the proportion of those&#13;
                              without a toilet halved. Net secondary enrollment increased from 27 percent in 2002/3 to 50 percent&#13;
                              in 2012/13 showing significant improvements in education.&#13;
&#13;
                          Increases in endowments, primarily human capital and access to land coupled with&#13;
                          non-farm job creation were major drivers of poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
                          b)	 Welfare gains were driven by increasing educational attainment and transition to non-farm employ-&#13;
                              ment. The increase in education attainment was especially critical in facilitating the transition to&#13;
                              non-farm incomes and increases in returns to agriculture. Complete primary education was associ-&#13;
                              ated with higher productivity in agriculture while lower secondary education facilitated the transi-&#13;
                              tion into non-farm activities. Increases in endowments and productive opportunities were thus the&#13;
                              key drivers of poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
                          Many households are vulnerable as consumption levels in Lao PDR are still low by in-&#13;
                          ternational standards&#13;
&#13;
                          c)	 Poverty could have declined by more had a large number of vulnerable households not fallen back&#13;
                              into poverty. About half of the poor in 2012/13 were previously non-poor in 2007/8 and more than&#13;
                              two thirds of them had been non-poor at some point during that 10 year period. Many people es-&#13;
                              caping poverty remained close to the poverty line where vulnerability is high. About 80 percent of&#13;
                              the population in 2012/13 still lived on less than PPP 2005 $2.5 per day and faced at least a 10 per-&#13;
                              cent chance of falling into poverty in subsequent periods.&#13;

&#13;
                          Agriculture shocks and health shocks are main drivers of household vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
                          d)	 The losses in welfare were driven by agriculture shocks, mainly in the form of food price changes and&#13;
                              loss of land, and to some extent catastrophic health expenditures. There are more net sellers than&#13;
                              net buyers of rice in Lao PDR, especially in the rice surplus areas in the center and the south, there-&#13;
                              fore an increase in the price of rice has a net benefit while a decrease results in a net aggregate loss&#13;
                              in welfare. The drop in prices in 2012/13 compared to 2007/8 thus had a negative welfare impact in&#13;
                              the center and the south. The loss of land impacted urban dwellers who supplement their non-farm&#13;
                              incomes with farming, which serves as a strong reminder that productivity at the entry level in the&#13;
                              non-farm sector is not yet high enough to sustain livelihoods of poorly skilled people to completely&#13;
                              transition out of agriculture. Vulnerability is highest among ethnic minorities, some of whom (the&#13;
                              Monkhmer and Hmong-Lu-Mien) are twice likely to fall back into poverty than other groups.&#13;
&#13;
                          Poverty reduction could have been much higher had growth been broad based.&#13;
&#13;
                          e)	 Natural resource led economic growth in Lao PDR did not translate into a commensurate increase&#13;
                              in household consumption and disproportionately benefited the non-poor, resulting in a smaller&#13;
                              decline in poverty than if it had been equitably distributed across all income groups. Average con-&#13;
                              sumption per capita grew by 2.2 percent per year between 2002/3 and 2012/13, almost four per-&#13;
                              centage points less than the rate of economic growth. At just 1.3 percent per year, consumption&#13;
                              growth was even lower for the bottom 40 percent. Lao PDR had one of the lowest growth elasticities&#13;
                              of poverty in the South East Asia region as hydro-electricity generation and mining drove output&#13;
                              growth but only created a few jobs. This limited shared prosperity because more jobs are created in&#13;
                              other sectors (especially in services) whose growth lagged the natural resource sectors due to a poor&#13;
                              business environment and skills constraints.&#13;
&#13;
                          Looking ahead, higher poverty reduction in Lao PDR can be achieved by creating bet-&#13;
                          ter economic opportunities for both the poor and non-poor, and by strengthening the&#13;
                          social protection system.&#13;
&#13;
                          f )	 Job creation, stimulating productivity growth and improving the quality of jobs in the non-farm&#13;
                               sector is a key pathway for reducing poverty in Lao PDR, to be achieved by creating a vibrant labor&#13;
                               intensive non-farm sector, especially in services. This requires improving the regulatory and business&#13;
                               environment where Lao PDR is the lowest ranked within the region, coupled with continued invest-&#13;
                               ment in education. An improved business environment and higher productivity in the non-farm&#13;
                               sector are necessary for attracting investment for creating more non-farm jobs and raising wage&#13;
                               earnings without hurting competitiveness, while further investment in education is needed to pro-&#13;
                               vide people with the pre-requisite skills to obtain non-farm jobs rewarding enough to keep them&#13;
                               out of poverty and alleviate the skills constraints that have also hampered firm growth.&#13;

&#13;
                         g)	 Growth in agriculture incomes is still an important pillar for reducing poverty. Many people engaged&#13;
                             in agriculture, especially the less educated mid-aged, will remain in the sector for the foreseeable&#13;
                             future. Raising agriculture income is the main pathway out of poverty for them. This will require i)&#13;
                             lowering marketing costs through public investments and better regulations and supporting open&#13;
                             trade policies to uplift farm prices and increase the profitability of farming, ii) focusing on increasing&#13;
                             productivity given the unsustainability of further land expansion to increase agriculture production&#13;
                             which has driven growth in agriculture income thus far and iii) improving human capital of farmers&#13;
                             through training and agricultural extension services to allow the majority of less educated farmers&#13;
                             to catch up with more educated farmers in raising their productivity.&#13;
&#13;
                         h)	 Promoting greater resilience, especially in the agricultural sector, through improved social safety&#13;
                             nets and insurance will be important for ensuring the sustainability of poverty reduction going for-&#13;
                             ward. Key areas of focus should be i) increasing resilience in agriculture since farming households&#13;
                             are twice as likely to fall back into poverty than non-farming households, ii) strengthening social in-&#13;
                             surance â&#128;&#147; especially on health insurance or universal access to health care, iii) putting in place social&#13;
                             welfare programs that target the vulnerable and the chronically poor and iv) deepening financial&#13;
                             inclusion to expand options available for households to cope with shocks.&#13;

                         mobility in Lao PDR: 2002/3 â&#128;&#147; 2012/13&#13;
&#13;
                         Poverty reduction continued and other aspects of wellbeing improved&#13;
&#13;
                         1.	 Poverty declined gradually in Lao PDR over the past decade. Estimates from the Lao Expenditure and&#13;
                             Consumption Surveys (LECS) show that poverty declined from 33.5 percent in 2002/3 to 23.2 per-&#13;
                             cent in 2012/13 (see Figure 1). This translates to half a million less poor people in 2012/13 compared&#13;
                             to the 1.85 million people living in poverty in 2002/3. It also means that Lao PDR achieved the MDG&#13;
                             target of halving extreme poverty by 2015 (now below the poverty target of 24 percent in 2015) - a&#13;
                             conclusion that is also reached when considering the proportion of the population living on less&#13;
                             than PPP (2005) 1.25 dollars per day per person. The improvements in living standards is reflected in&#13;
                             the cumulative growth in average consumption of 25 percent over that period, but the cumulative&#13;
                             growth of 14 percent for the bottom 40 percent, explains why the pace of poverty reduction was&#13;
                             only gradual.&#13;

                         2.	 Improvements in other socio-economic indicators provide further evidence that living standards&#13;
                             of people got better (see Figure 2). Households are living in better houses and significantly more of&#13;
                             them own more assets, even among the poor. More households (41 percent in 2012/13 compared to&#13;
                             14 percent in 2002/3) are living in houses built with bricks or concrete and more of them are living in&#13;
                             houses with cement floors or floor tiles compared to 2002/3. Nearly 80 percent of households were&#13;
                             connected to electricity in 2012/13. The proportion of households without any type of toilet came&#13;
                             down to 27 percent in 2012/13 compared to 50 percent in 2002/3. This is a significant improvement&#13;
                             especially in rural areas. Net enrollment in lower secondary school increased to about 50 percent in&#13;
                             2012/13 from 26.8 in 2002/3, but the increase was greater for the non-poor than the poor (a detailed&#13;
                             discussion is provided in the poverty profile, see World Bank, 2014).&#13;
&#13;
                         There was significant churning - while many households escaped poverty, a con-&#13;
                         siderable number also fell into poverty&#13;
&#13;
                         3.	 These significant gains in welfare are confirmed in the analysis of panel data (see Annex 1), which&#13;
                             tracks the same households over two or more periods in time. This data shows that overall, 55 per-&#13;

                             poverty were reversible for a significant number of them. The decline in poverty at the aggregate&#13;
                             level hides significant churning. Table 1 shows that while 63 percent of the poor (equivalent to 16.7&#13;
                             percent of the population) in 2007/8 moved out of poverty, 14 percent (equivalent to 10 percent of&#13;
                             the population) became poor in 2012/13 despite being non-poor in 2007/8. The national poverty&#13;
                             rate still declined because those who escaped poverty outnumbered those who fell into poverty,&#13;
                             but clearly a significant number of people were worse-off in 2012/13 than they were previously.&#13;
                             Those previously non-poor in 2007/8 constituted slightly more than half of poor people in 2012/13&#13;
                             for example. A similar trend is observed during 2002/3 â&#128;&#147; 07/8 as well. In fact, only 32 percent of the&#13;
                             poor in 2012/13 had been poor in both 2002/3 and 2007/8 (see Table 2a). Thus just 5.6 percent of&#13;
                             people observed in all three rounds of the panel reported being poor across all periods while 40 per-&#13;
                             cent were found poor in at least one of the years (see Table 2b). Holding on to the gains previously&#13;
                             made proved to be a major challenge during the past decade.&#13;

                             income or those receiving remittances. Non-poor households with these characteristics also faced a&#13;
                             lower risk of falling into poverty between 2007/8 and 2012/13. That means agricultural households,&#13;
                             those with less than complete primary education or live in hard to reach villages faced the highest&#13;
                             risk of falling into poverty. Among the non-poor, farming households were twice more likely to fall&#13;
                             back into poverty than non-farming households (see Table 3).&#13;

                         9.	 The differences in opportunities and risks faced by different socio-economic groups are reflected in&#13;
                             the poverty profile of Lao PDR (Figures 4 and 5). Poverty is substantially higher in rural areas, at 28.6&#13;
                             percent, compared to 10 percent in urban areas, a gap that has widened over the past five years dur-&#13;
                             ing which poverty declined faster in urban areas. Poverty is concentrated among minority (non Lao-&#13;
                             Tai) ethnic groups, the less educated - still a disproportionate share of them ethnic minorities, and&#13;
                             those who primarily depend on family farming or are unemployed. However, the Chine-Tibet ethnic&#13;
                             group has fared better in recent years, as their poverty rate significantly declined to levels close to&#13;
                             the Lao-Tai group (more details in poverty profile: World Bank, 2014).&#13;

                         Drivers of poverty in Lao PDR:&#13;
                         2002/3 â&#128;&#147; 2012/13&#13;
&#13;
                         Increasing labor income was important for poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
                         10.	From an asset framework perspective (Bussolo and Lopez-Culva, 2014), poverty reduction depends&#13;
                             on the expansion of householdâ&#128;&#153;s income generating capacity. This is primarily driven by increases&#13;
                             in endowments of the poor and increases in the intensity of use and returns to these endowments&#13;
                             combined with changes in prices. These factors determine household labor income, which in ad-&#13;
                             dition to transfers and shocks households face, determine overall householdsâ&#128;&#153; income, hence their&#13;
                             ability to escape poverty (see Figure 6).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                         11.	In Lao PDR, labor and access to land are the main assets owned by the poor. Thus improvements in&#13;
                             human capital (thus augmenting labor assets), access to land and raising labor productivity along&#13;
                             with creation of productive offâ&#128;&#147;farm opportunities are key to lifting the poor out of poverty. Non-&#13;
                             labor income in the form of remittances and social transfers provide a second avenue for reducing&#13;
                             poverty, but their scale in Lao PDR is small. Poverty reduction in the past decade can thus be attrib-&#13;
                             uted to increases in the per capita labor incomes of the poor, driven by a combination of an increase&#13;
                             in agriculture income and a transition to off-farm activities which raised both the intensity of use and&#13;
                             productivity of labor.&#13;

                          12.	The increase in human capital and access to agriculture land suggests that changes in endowments&#13;
                              played a role in increasing labor incomes during 2002/3 - 2012/13. Education and household de-&#13;
                              mographic changes underpinned improvement in human capital. The proportion of working age&#13;
                              people (aged 15 â&#128;&#147; 64) with complete lower secondary education or more increased from 26.7 per-&#13;
                              cent in 2002/3 to 35 percent in 2012/13 (Figure 8). At the same time, the dependency ratio declined&#13;
                              from 2.7 to 1.9 (see Figure 7) as families became smaller (e.g. by one person less in rural areas) with&#13;
                              fewer children. Access to agriculture land in rural areas increased by 26 percent between 2002/3 and&#13;
                              2012/13, mostly in the second half of the decade. Commodity prices were however volatile, intro-&#13;

                         13.	Non-farm economic opportunities gradually expanded, thus facilitating the transition into non-farm&#13;
                             employment. The economy added about 400 000 non-agriculture jobs, about 270 000 of them be-&#13;
                             ing wage jobs (see Figure 9). Jobs in industry doubled between 2002/3 and 2007/8 but have since&#13;
                             stagnated and services have become the engine of non-farm job growth, accounting for more than&#13;
                             85 percent of the increase in non-farm jobs between 2007/8 and 2012/13. New non-farm jobs could&#13;
                             absorb two thirds of the 610 000 new labor market entrants between 2002/3 and 2012/13, resulting&#13;
                             in an increase in the share of employment in the non-farm sector. By 2012/13, agriculture was the&#13;
                             primary occupation for about 64 percent of the labor force, down from 73 percent a decade earlier.&#13;
                             Others in agriculture diversified into non-farm activities but did not leave agriculture completely,&#13;
                             contributing to a decline in the depth of underemployment in rural areas. There was an addition of 4&#13;
                             hours to the total hours worked per week among people with both a farm and non-farm income in&#13;
                             rural areas, signifying an increase in the intensity of use of labor among these people.&#13;
&#13;
                         14.	The contribution of various factors to poverty reduction is analyzed by estimating the influence of&#13;
                             each of them on the probabilities of moving or entering into poverty while controlling for the influ-&#13;
                             ence of other factors. This is done using multivariate probit regressions based on the panel data&#13;
                             component of the last two LECS surveys. Two sets of probit regressions are estimated. One set es-&#13;
                             timates the probability of moving out of poverty for only those who were poor in 2007/8 and the&#13;
                             other estimates the probability of falling into poverty for those who were non-poor in 2007/8 only.&#13;
                             Detailed results of these estimates are presented in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
                         Education and off-farm job creation are major drivers of poverty&#13;
&#13;
                         15.	The increase in educational attainment and growth in opportunities for transitioning into non-farm&#13;
                             employment emerge as primary drivers of poverty reduction in Lao PDR. The likelihood of moving&#13;
                             out of poverty for an agricultural, nonâ&#128;&#147;LaoTai household with at least one person with post primary&#13;
                             education was at least 80 percent, compared to the 47 percent chance faced by a similar household&#13;
                             without anyone with formal education. The chances jump to 88 percent among non-farming house-&#13;
                             holds similar in other characteristics (see Figure 10). The gap in the likelihood of exiting poverty&#13;
                             between ethnic minorities and the Lao-Tai narrows when one controls for education attainment and&#13;
                             livelihoods, but is not completely eliminated. The Mon-Khmer in particular would still face a lower&#13;
                             chance of exiting poverty, suggesting they get lower returns for their assets.&#13;
&#13;
                         16.	More education facilitated transition into better rewarding non-farm economic activities, with the&#13;
                             highly skilled moving out of agriculture completely and low skilled diversifying their income port-&#13;
                             folio from agriculture. People with higher levels of education are more likely to be in non-farm em-&#13;
                             ployment (see Figure 11). The odds of having primary employment in the non-farm sector increase&#13;
                             from 11 percent for people with no formal education to 27 percent when one has complete primary&#13;
                             education and 45 percent among those with complete lower secondary education. At 82 percent&#13;
                             and 91.5 percent respectively, those with vocational training or a university degree have the highest&#13;
                             likelihood of being in a non-farm primary economic activity, most likely in the service sector. Such&#13;
                             people were likely to have spent none of their time on farming unlike people with lower education&#13;
                             who tend to be self-employed, with small household businesses that generate low returns which&#13;
                             they supplement with farming income.&#13;

                             reduced underemployment thus becoming a main pathway out of poverty for people employed or&#13;
                             switching from agriculture. Among farming households, those with a non-farm wage income were&#13;
                             12 percent more likely to escape poverty. However, having a non-farm wage income did not improve&#13;
                             the chances of escaping poverty among poor non-farming households, indicating the working poor&#13;
                             in low productivity non-farm jobs have difficulties escaping poverty without supplementary farm&#13;
                             income. This is confirmed in consumption growth regressions showing that consumption growth&#13;
                             within the non-farm wage sector is insignificant while growth is higher for household businesses.&#13;
                             Thus either one attains an adequate level of education so they never become working poor in the&#13;
                             first place, or else resort to supplementing non-farm wage income with farming income. Only the&#13;
                             transition out of agriculture to higher paying jobs (mostly in the service sector) is sufficient to lift&#13;
                             people out of poverty, highlighting the need for productivity growth and improved quality of em-&#13;

                         18.	The transition out of agriculture could have been quicker and poverty reduced faster had non-farm&#13;
                             job creation matched up to the rate of economic growth. Despite non-farm jobs increasing by 400&#13;
                             000 between 2002/3 and 2012/13, structural transformation in employment was not commensurate&#13;
                             to the higher pace of non-agriculture output growth. The aggregate share of non-agriculture sec-&#13;
                             tors in economic output increased by 14 percentage points. However, growth was driven by capital&#13;
                             intensive sectors that did not create many jobs. The increase in the share of value added from hy-&#13;
                             dropower generation and mining accounted for 10 out of the 14 percentage points increase of the&#13;
                             non-agriculture sectorsâ&#128;&#153; share of economic output, but its share of employment increased by less&#13;
                             than half a percentage point (see Figure 12). Other non-agriculture sectors contributed to almost&#13;
                             all of the 7 percentage point increase in non-agriculture sectorsâ&#128;&#153; share of employment instead â&#128;&#147; an&#13;
                             increase proportionately higher than the increase in their share of economic output. The transition&#13;
                             to the non-farm sector can be faster and poverty reduction greater, with faster growth in these labor&#13;
                             intensive non-farm sectors. This requires improving the business climate (see Lao PDR Development&#13;
                             Report; World Bank, 2014b) where Lao PDR is currently the lowest ranked in the region.&#13;
&#13;
                         19.	Education plays an instrumental role in increasing agriculture income in Lao PDR, with productivity&#13;
                             gains in the sector associated with higher education attainment up to completion of primary educa-&#13;
                             tion. More educated households produce both more rice per person and more rice per area planted.&#13;
                             Households headed by someone with completed primary education or above produce 30 percent&#13;
                             more rice per person (and also per adult) than households headed by someone without any formal&#13;
                             education (see Table 4) for example. Their average rice yields are at least 26 percent higher - even&#13;
                             among households with a similar land terrain, most notably in midland and upland areas (see Figure&#13;
                             13). Households with more education also have a higher degree of commercialization. At least 56&#13;
                             percent of households headed by a person with complete primary education or more sold rice on&#13;
                             the market compared to 40 percent among those headed by someone with no formal education.&#13;
                             Thus higher education attainment not only facilitates movements out of agriculture, it also raises&#13;
                             productivity and incomes within the sector too.&#13;

                         Raising agriculture income remains an important driver of poverty reduction&#13;

                         20.	A large majority in agriculture will remain in the sector in the foreseeable future, thus raising agri-&#13;
                             culture incomes is their main pathway out of poverty. About 35 percent of people engaged in family&#13;
                             agriculture are 40 years old and above and have at most primary education (see Table 5). Also, 85&#13;
                             percent of people engaged in family agriculture attained primary education at most, while a fifth&#13;
                             have no formal education at all. Given their age and poor literacy standards (World Bank, 2014b), the&#13;
                             benefits of continued investment in formal education will not accrue to them. They will continue to&#13;
                             have difficulties finding employment in the non-farm sectors where higher education is required to&#13;
                             obtain a rewarding job. For them, growth in agriculture income - either through increasing access to&#13;
                             land, higher profitability of farming and general increases in productivity, is the main pathway out of&#13;
                             poverty.&#13;

                         21.	Access to agriculture land was important for poverty reduction in Lao PDR so far as it helped the near&#13;
                             poor in rural areas from sliding back into poverty, but there are limits to which increases in access&#13;
                             can drive poverty reduction. Households with access to more land in 2007/8 were less likely to fall&#13;
                             into poverty between 2007/8 and 2012/13, even after controlling for other household and regional&#13;
                             characteristics. Land constrained households fully utilize their land, thus an increase in access to&#13;
                             land would necessarily increase their productive capacity. Improved access to land partly contrib-&#13;
                             uted to poverty reduction in the north, where own produced food consumption increased signifi-&#13;
                             cantly. However, land is not limitless thus continued expansion of land will at some point encroach&#13;
                             on unsuitable land or become environmentally unsustainable. Further agriculture income growth&#13;
                             should be driven by increased productivity, prices or both, as the marginal contribution of increas-&#13;

                             household headed by a person with complete primary education in the absence of health shocks. In&#13;
                             general, the risk was low for higher levels of education attainment.&#13;

                         24.	Farm produce price changes are a risk factor faced by households. Initially, higher agriculture prices&#13;
                             between 2002/3 and 2007/8 contributed to poverty reduction in rural areas, but declining prices in&#13;
                             the central and south provinces in 2012 (see Figure 16) reversed some of those gains. While a third&#13;
                             of the poor and near poor are seasonal net buyers of rice and another 5 percent all year net buyers,&#13;
                             more than half of them are in fact net sellers of rice (see Table 6). Thus more of the poor and less&#13;
                             well-off benefit from increases in rice prices. An increase in the price of rice on average raises the&#13;
                             likelihood of agriculture household escaping poverty while a decline had a negative effect on farm-&#13;
                             ers, increasing their likelihood of entering into poverty. The probability of falling into poverty among&#13;
                             farmers increases by about 50 percent when the median price of a kilogram of glutinous paddy rice&#13;
                             drops by 500 Kip, compared to when the price stays the same (see Figure 15). Thus the decline in&#13;
                             farm gate prices for paddy rice between 2007/8 and 2012/13 in the central and south provinces had&#13;
                             a net negative welfare impact thereby slowing down the pace of poverty reduction in these regions.&#13;

                         25.	Changes in government policy and regulations are necessary to pass through higher output prices&#13;
                             to farmers, increase profitability of agriculture and lift many farming households out of poverty.&#13;
                             Price flactuations in Lao PDR are partly policy induced, especially through trade restrictions (Durevall&#13;
                             and Van der Walle, 2014). Thus unlike in Cambodia, where rice price increases accounted for 24 per-&#13;
                             cent of the poverty reduction between 2007 and 2011 (World Bank, 2013a), deliberate policies sup-&#13;
                             pressing the price of rice in Lao PDR inhibited poverty reduction among farmers, making them more&#13;
                             vulnerable to falling into poverty instead. Lao PDR needs to adopt open trade policies that will uplift&#13;
                             farm prices. Marketing costs too, can be lowered through public investments and better regulations&#13;
                             to further increase the profitability of farming (World Bank, 2014b).&#13;
&#13;
                         26.	The â&#128;&#156;lossâ&#128;&#157; of agriculture land is a risk factor for urban households engaged in farming. Among ur-&#13;
                             ban households engaged in farming in 2007/8, those who lost access to more than 10 percent of&#13;
                             their agriculture land were 8 percent more likely to end up in poverty in 2012/13. Most of the near&#13;
                             poor in urban areas, mainly among the low skilled, have small plots which they use to supplement&#13;
                             inadequate non-farm incomes and losing this means of income pushes them into poverty, proving&#13;
                             that moving out of agriculture is beneficial mostly for those with higher human capital who can get&#13;
                             higher paying non-agriculture jobs. As highlighted earlier, those with lower education transition into&#13;
                             non-farming activities through self-employment in low returns activities. Productivity gains at the&#13;
                             entry level in the non-farm sector would need to improve significantly to sustain livelihoods if they&#13;
                             completely move out of agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
                         Uninsured households are vulnerable to catastrophic out of pocket health&#13;
                         expenditures&#13;
&#13;
                         27.	Catastrophic out of pocket health expenditures were another risk factor for households, but this&#13;
                             is only evident among urban households whose health care utilization is higher than rural areas.&#13;
                             About 9.4 percent of households had a household member who was hospitalized in 2012/13. A&#13;
                             higher proportion of them were either supported by relatives or had some form of insurance as&#13;
                             health care utilization among the uninsured was extremely low. The uninsured who had to bor-&#13;
                             row to pay for hospitalization were 17 percent more likely to fall into poverty in urban areas. No&#13;
                             effect was detected in rural areas where health care utilization is very low among people without&#13;
                             insurance (Powell-Jackson, 2010), which could imply that the cost of care may in fact be a barrier&#13;
                             to access to health care by the uninsured poor. Health insurance coverage in Lao PDR is very low,&#13;
                             with only 12 percent of the population covered by some form of insurance (World Bank, 2013b) and&#13;
                             those covered are mainly formal wage workers and likely to be well off. Most of the less well-off are&#13;
                             therefore highly vulnerable to being pushed into poverty in the event of a health shock that leads to&#13;
                             catastrophic out of pocket expenditures.&#13;

                         Conclusion and policy implications&#13;
                         29.	Poverty in Lao PDR has declined gradually. Analysis of changes in poverty status of the same house-&#13;
                             holds across time confirms this improvement of welfare, but also reveals significant movements in&#13;
                             and out of poverty, and that households moving out of poverty stay close to the poverty line. About&#13;
                             16 percent of the people moved out of poverty between 2007/8 and 2012/13, but 10 percent fell&#13;
                             into poverty at the same time, so that half the poor people in 2012/13 were previously non-poor.&#13;
                             This high vulnerability is not a phenomenon faced only by the near poor. It is observed across the&#13;
                             entire distribution.&#13;
&#13;
                         30.	Poverty reduction was driven by a combination of creation of non-farm opportunities and growth&#13;
                             in agriculture income, and education was instrumental for both of these factors. Households with a&#13;
                             non-farm income were more likely to move out of poverty, but even in agriculture, those with higher&#13;
                             educational attainment were also more likely to escape poverty. Education played a role by provid-&#13;
                             ing the pre-request skills for people to transition out of agriculture, while within agriculture, it was&#13;
                             associated with improved average productivity.&#13;
&#13;
                         31.	Productivity gains in the non-farm sector are still required to support structural transformation from&#13;
                             agriculture and put people on a higher earning path. Currently, a significant number of households&#13;
                             who became non-poor by moving into non-farm activities supplement their earnings with agricul-&#13;
                             ture income even in urban areas. Indications that households who end up with non-farm incomes&#13;
                             only after losing access to agriculture land are more likely to fall back into poverty further high-&#13;
                             lights the importance of supplemental agriculture income to the less well off with low skills. This&#13;
                             also means average productivity and earnings in the non-farm sector at the entry level are currently&#13;
                             not high enough to support a full transition out of agriculture for households at the bottom of the&#13;
                             distribution.&#13;
&#13;
                         32.	Creation of non-farm opportunities however remains a major pathway out of poverty. Faster poverty&#13;
                             reduction can be achieved by additional investments in human capital and improving the business&#13;
                             environment to raise productivity and foster economic diversification towards more labor intensive&#13;
                             sectors that create more non-farm jobs. While education attainment has been improving, still just&#13;
                             above a third of the working age population have completed lower secondary education, so the&#13;
                             majority of the people lack the skills necessary to move them out of agriculture. At the same time,&#13;
                             this lack of skills is a constraint to productivity growth and job creation in the non-farm sector. As the&#13;
                             findings from the recent Investment Climate Assessment in Lao PDR (World Bank, 2014c) showed,&#13;
                             growth in manufacturing and service sectors has been lagging in part due to skills constraints. A&#13;
                             weak business environment was found to be a major impediment to productivity growth and job&#13;
                             creation. Thus investment in education and skills and improving the business environment are key&#13;
                             priorities for poverty reduction in Lao PDR.&#13;

                         33.	Growth of agriculture incomes is necessary for poverty reduction, but that requires a focus on im-&#13;
                             proving productivity and returns to agriculture by allowing higher farm gate prices for rice. The gains&#13;
                             in agriculture in recent years have been dominated by increases in acreage, which is not limitless and&#13;
                             may already started having a negative effect on average yields, as people utilize unsuitable land.&#13;
                             Lower farm produce prices, which in Lao PDR is partly policy induced, harm farmers. The lower farm&#13;
                             gate prices of rice in the center and south provinces meant that farmers in Lao PDR failed to benefit&#13;
                             from rice production to the same extent that lifted rice farmers out of poverty in Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
                         34.	Building resilience in agriculture and a stronger social protection mechanism are necessary to pro-&#13;
                             tect the gains from progress made so far. Most of the poor in the past decade had been non-poor at&#13;
                             some point during that time, but risks such as agriculture income shocks (in the form of loss of land&#13;
                             and lower prices) and catastrophic out of pocket health expenditures, pushed them back into pov-&#13;
                             erty. Putting in place policies for sustainable growth in agriculture, social safety nets, social health&#13;
                             insurance and expanding financial inclusion would mitigate against shocks and safeguard the pov-&#13;
                             erty gains Lao PDR has made.&#13;

                         Annex 1: Construction of the panel from the LECS 3 -5 surveys1&#13;
&#13;
                         1.	 The LECS is a nationally representative household survey designed to generate representative pov-&#13;
                             erty estimates and other socioeconomic information at the national and provincial levels. The survey&#13;
                             sample covers the whole country and is stratified by province and village type (urban, rural with road&#13;
                             and rural without road). In the 2002/3 LECS 3 survey, 15 households were surveyed in 540 villages.&#13;
                             In the 2007/8 LECS 4 survey, 16 households were surveyed in 519 villages. A panel element to the&#13;
                             survey was added at this stage. Enumerators first randomly selected 8 households from a list of LECS&#13;
                             3 households for inclusion in the LECS 4, after which they randomly selected sufficient households&#13;
                             to make up a sample of 16 households in each village from the list of non-LECS 3 households. If fewer&#13;
                             than 8 LECS 3 households remained in the village, the enumerators selected enough non-LECS 3&#13;
                             households to guarantee a sample of 16. The non-panel households were assigned numbers from&#13;
                             16 onwards in LECS 4. The same procedure was repeated in LECS 5, this time additional non-panel&#13;
                             households were assigned numbers from 24 onwards. No tracking of households that moved vil-&#13;
                             lages, split-off or individuals who migrated was done at each stage.&#13;
&#13;
                         Identifying panel households&#13;
                         2.	 The LECS nine-digit household identification numbers (HHID) are made up of two-digit province&#13;
                             numbers, two-digit district numbers, three-digit village numbers, and two-digit household num-&#13;
                             bers. In LECS 3 a sequential six-digit household number (HHI) was also assigned to each household&#13;
                             and used as the household identifier. The HHID variable was deleted in the main data, although&#13;
                             province, district and village numbers were kept. The HHID could however be recovered from the ag-&#13;
                             ricultural and household business modules which retained both HHID and HHI, but did not contain&#13;
                             all households, therefore a manual match had to be made for some. This was done by comparing&#13;
                             the households surveyed in LECS 3 (with missing household numbers) in a given village, with the&#13;
                             households surveyed in LECS 4 (with household numbers ranging from 1 - 15). In cases with only&#13;
                             one missing household number in a village, the correct HHID could easily be added. Where more&#13;
                             than one household lacked the correct number, basic household characteristics in LECS 3 were com-&#13;
                             pared with LECS 4. Households were identified by comparing age, gender and ethnicity of house-&#13;
                             hold members. Where there were multiple plausible matches the households were not matched, to&#13;
                             avoid false matching. The LECS 4 â&#128;&#147; 5 panel could be more easily constructed as the HHID variable&#13;
                             for panel households was kept identical across time, although there was risk of false matches for 55&#13;
                             households numbered 24-66 in 18 villages in LECS 5 because in some cases in LECS 4, households&#13;
                             had numbers from 1-31 instead of 1 to 23.&#13;

                             tween LECS 3 and LECS 4, and 4,088 between LECS 4 and LECS 5. Of these, 2,085 could be traced&#13;
                             back to LECS 3 (see Table 7) for a summary. The number of matches per village suggests that attrition&#13;
                             was small. About 497 out of 519 villages in LECS 4 and 496 out of 515 villages in LECS 5 had 8 (the&#13;
                             expected maximum) or more successful matches, although no match was found in 13 villages in&#13;
                             LECS 4 and 2 villages in LECS 5. There are 12 villages in LECS3-4 and 8 in LECS4-5 where more than 8&#13;
                             panel households were included.&#13;

                         4.	 An assessment of the quality of matches was also done by comparing characteristics of the house-&#13;
                             hold head and other members (ethnicity, date and year of birth and gender). However, differences in&#13;
                             these characteristics do not necessarily imply an incorrect match. The panel did not specifically track&#13;
                             individuals therefore a consistent assignment of individual IDs across rounds is not guaranteed,&#13;
                             resulting in inconsistencies in individual characteristics when different individual IDs are assigned&#13;
                             across surveys. There could also be a change in the household head or misreporting on variables&#13;
                             such as age. A substantial number of respondents did not report a day and month of birth so a com-&#13;
                             parison on the year of birth is presented instead. This shows that that 1,974 and 2,464 of household&#13;
                             heads appear to have been present in the previous round, and 3,164 and 3,458 households respec-&#13;

                         Panel weights construction&#13;
                         5.	 The panel weights were constructed following the procedure outlined in Himelein (2014), done in&#13;
                             the following 3 steps:&#13;
                         â&#128;¢	 Calculating the probability of selection into the panel â&#128;&#147; this is calculated at the level of the strata&#13;
                             defined by village type (rural, rural no road and urban) and province. The probability of a household&#13;
                                                                                         mh&#13;
                             in strata h being selected into the panel sample is p1 = Mh     , Where m is the number of households&#13;
                             in strata h in the first round of the panel and M is the total number of households from that strata in&#13;
                             the second round of the panel.&#13;
                         â&#128;¢	 A post-stratification adjustment â&#128;&#147; calculate the post-stratification adjustment, w1, at the strata level.&#13;
                             The post-stratification adjustment is equal to the total population in the strata, as calculated from&#13;
                             the base household weights for the first survey, divided by the total of the panel weights for that&#13;
                             strata.&#13;
                         â&#128;¢	 Final weights - The household is conceived of as a concrete unit, so there was no tracking attempted&#13;
                             of household members that had left the household between survey rounds. Thus, there is no need&#13;
                             to correct for household selection into tracking or to conduct â&#128;&#156;fair share correctionâ&#128;&#157; for new house-&#13;
                             hold members who are added to the sample because of a household member joining their house-&#13;
                             hold. Therefore the final panel weight for a household is:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       w final = p1-1*w1&#13;
&#13;
                         The panel weights have been designed so that the weighted estimates will be representative of the&#13;
                         sample of households at the time of the earliest panel wave in question.&#13;
&#13;
                         Comparability of the panel to the cross-section&#13;
                         6.	 A comparison of panel households to non-panel households shows statistically insignificant or very&#13;
                             small differences at the baseline for two wave panels (LECS 3 -4 and LECS 4 -5), with the exception&#13;
                             of education attainment in the LECS 4 -5 and ethnicity of household head in LECS 3 â&#128;&#147; 4 (see Table&#13;
                             8). Larger differences are observed at the baseline for three round the LECS 3 -5 panel households,&#13;
                             suggesting a poor representativeness for the three wave panel even at the baseline. Statistically&#13;
                             significant differences are also observed at the end line even in two wave panels in which panel&#13;
                             households show up in the endline survey with older household heads, larger household sizes and&#13;
                             in LECS 4-5 panel, a 2 percentage points lower poverty rate. These differences may suggest presence&#13;
                             of some attrition bias, but no data on the identification of households that moved or replacement&#13;
                             rules that were employed are available for one to effect a correction of this bias.&#13;

                         Annex 2: Regression results&#13;
                         1.	 The analysis of drivers of poverty is done using multivariate probit regressions based on the panel&#13;
                             data component of the last two LECS surveys. Two sets of probit regressions are estimated. One set&#13;
                             estimates the probability of moving out of poverty for only those who were poor in 2007/8 (see&#13;
                             equation 1) and the other set estimates the probability of falling into poverty for those who were&#13;
                             non-poor in 2007/8 only (see equation 2).&#13;
&#13;
                              Pr (P0,it = 0|P0,it-1 = 1) = Î± + Î²Xi,t-1 + Î³Zi,t-1 + Î¸Wi,t-1 + Î´Si,t + Îµi   (1)&#13;
&#13;
                              Pr (P0,it = 1|P0,it-1 = 0) = Î± + Î²Xi,t-1 + Î³Zi,t-1 + Î¸Wi,t-1 + Î´Si,t + Îµi   (2)&#13;
&#13;
                         2.	 Equations 1 and 2 represent the types of regressions estimated where P0,it is the poverty status in&#13;
                             year (t) so that Pr(P0,it = 0|P0,it-1 = 1) is the probability of being non-poor in year (t) for people who&#13;
                             were non-poor in the previous period and Pr(P0,it = 1|P0,it-1 = 0) is the probability of exiting poverty.&#13;
                             The explanatory variables are selected to estimate a reduced form regression based on the asset&#13;
                             based framework, so that Xi,t-1 is a vector of household characteristics representing initial (previ-&#13;
                             ous wave) household assets/endowments (demographics â&#128;&#147; household size, dependency ratio and&#13;
                             gender of household head; endowments â&#128;&#147; education, land and productive assets), Zi,t-1 represents&#13;
                             household livelihoods in previous wave (having a wage income, household business and received&#13;
                             remittances), Wi,t-1 is a set of community or location characteristics (village access to road, electricity,&#13;
                             land terrain, region), and Si,t are contemporaneous shocks (changes in median paddy rice price in&#13;
                             province, loss of land, household borrowed to pay out of pocket hospitalization expenses).&#13;
&#13;
                         3.	 These equations predict the probability of people with given initial endowments, livelihoods and&#13;
