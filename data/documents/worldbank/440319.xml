DIFFERENCES IN INCOME, NUTRITION AND POVERTY WITHIN BRAZIL&#13;
Regional disparities in living standards within Brazil have&#13;
received increasing attention in recent years. This paper attempts to&#13;
throw light on this issue by providing a quantitative range for these&#13;
differences. Drawing on the national consumption survey called ENDEF for&#13;
1974/75, estimates are set out for real income, nutritional levels and&#13;
poverty for major regions, and urban and rural areas.&#13;
The results of this study indicate that, although cost of living&#13;
adjustments narrow spatial differences, large regional disparities remain,&#13;
particularly upon comparing the Northeast and the Southeast. The use of&#13;
cost of living indices reduces urban-rural variations more than in the&#13;
case of regional differences, drastically narrowing the urban-rural gap in&#13;
food consumption. Poverty is, nevertheless, much more concentrated in the&#13;
rural areas than in urban areas, although regional differences in the&#13;
incidence of poverty are more striking than the urban-rural divergencies.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
In recent years, increasing concern has been expressed that&#13;
certain regions and areas in Brazil have been by-passed by the process&#13;
of economic growth. While the visible poverty in these places lends&#13;
support to this view, the need has emerged for a fuller evaluation of&#13;
this issue. The results of a 1974/75 nation-wide survey called ENDEF,&#13;
published from 1978 onwards, provide a basis for a comprehensive&#13;
comparison of the major regions and areas.&#13;
Analysis of the ENDEF data is being carried out at other&#13;
institutions as well as at FIBGE, the statistical institute in Rio&#13;
de Janeiro that undertook the survey. This work was carried out at&#13;
FIPE in Sao Paulo, as part of the institute's ongoing work on urban&#13;
and regional poverty related studies. The research benefited from&#13;
the work of several people at FIPE, in particular, Antonio Campino,&#13;
Vera Fava, Roberto Macedo, Eleuterio Prado and Eduardo Solorzano.&#13;
Solorzano's Master's thesis (March 1981) was in the same area of&#13;
investigation, and this paper would not have been possible without the&#13;
results jointly produced by him. Helpful comments were provided by&#13;
Luis Ablas, Alexandre Berndt, Douglas Keare, Constantino Lluch,&#13;
Paulo de Tarso Medeiros and Francisco de Assis Moura. Any errors in&#13;

DIFFERENCES IN INCOME, NUTRITION AND POVERTY&#13;
WIThIN BRAZIL&#13;
I. Introductory Summary&#13;
Disparity in the living standards across Brazil has been a matter&#13;
of increasing concern. It is seldom disputed that the rapid economic&#13;
growth during the postwar years 1/ must have brought benefits to lagging&#13;
regions and areas. But it is widely held that the growth process has been&#13;
very uneven. Today large spatial inequalities in well-being persist, as&#13;
symbolized by the wealth evident in some areas (particularly the highly&#13;
built-up urban centers of the Southeast) and the visible poverty in&#13;
others.&#13;
Table I.1 compares Brazil with the rest of the world on the basis&#13;
of some welfare indicators. The growth rate of the Brazilian economy&#13;
surpasses the average for most of the country groups. Compared to other&#13;
developing countries 2/, Brazil also performs better in terms of a number&#13;
of socio-economic indicators. These indicators, doctor per population,&#13;
percentage achievement of calorie requirement, etc., however, reflect&#13;
welfare levels at the mean for the country as a whole. A more&#13;
1/ Over the past three decades, the Brazilian economy grew at an annual&#13;
rate of roughly 7% in real terms. The growth rate between 1969-73 was&#13;
11%.&#13;
2/ Low income and middle income countries (to which Brazil belongs) and&#13;
petroleum exporters are included in these comparisons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
disaggregated picture is presented in Tables I.2 and I.3. Although the&#13;
latter tables are not fully comparable with Table I.1 owing to differences&#13;
in definitions and years compared, they nevertheless suggest that&#13;
indicators at the mean are quite unrepresentative for large parts of the&#13;
country. Wide disparities in the availability of services and welfare&#13;
levels emerge.&#13;
Thus, while Brazil as a whole has far greater numbers of doctors&#13;
per population than the average for middle income countries, the situation&#13;
in the Northeast (Region V - see Map 1) is not much better than in India&#13;
at its mean. The Northeast contains 32% of the country's people (Annex&#13;
Table 1). Similarly, although Brazil's mean calorie intake relative to&#13;
requirements is about the same as the average middle income country,&#13;
calorie deficits comparable to those in some low income countries are&#13;
shown in several regions 1/. To consider yet another indicator, while the&#13;
adult literacy rate for Brazil exceeds the average for middle income&#13;
countries, the estimate for the country's Northeast corresponds to the&#13;
average for low income countries.&#13;
This study addresses the question of the extent of the type of&#13;
disparities noted above by providing a quantitative range of the&#13;
differences in well-being in Brazil. For this purpose, estimates are&#13;
1/ Deficits in Table I.2 would be larger than in Table I.1 anyway, since&#13;
the former uses stricter requirements based on NRC 129] (see Section&#13;
IV), while the latter (WDR estimates) are based on FAO/WHO requirements&#13;

developed on income, nutrition and poverty for major regions and areas&#13;
across the country. In so doing, some frequently-used approaches to&#13;
measuring welfare are refined and applied.&#13;
A. An Approach&#13;
The paper draws on the results of a 1974/75 nation-wide household&#13;
expenditure study (Estudo Nacional da Despesa Familiar - ENDEF). The&#13;
study divides the country into seven major geographical regions on the&#13;
basis of the size of their populations and their internal similarities.&#13;
Most regions are further divided into one or more metropolitan areas,&#13;
non-metropolitan urban areas and rural areas. Annex Tables 1 and .2 and&#13;
Map 1 set out the ENDEF classification of regions and areas 1/.&#13;
ENDEF surveys annual family expenditures on highly disaggregated&#13;
consumption categories. The survey provides the greatest detail for food&#13;
items; consumption expenditure of some 120 of these items is given&#13;
separately. Intake of calories, proteins and other nutrients is also&#13;
measured, which can be compared against various established nutritional&#13;
norms.&#13;
Aggregates of estimated current expenditures on food and non-food&#13;
items are used as'measures of nominal income. Market values are imputed&#13;
for non-monetary components within these measures. ENDEF reports family&#13;
1/ A full description of the survey method and interpretation of results&#13;
can be found in [12] and [13].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
expenditures, numbers of families and family sizes for nine expenditure&#13;
classes. This permits us to present per capita mean expenditure values,&#13;
and also approximate per capita values for people belonging to a&#13;
particular percentile position in the expenditure distribution 1/. Apart&#13;
from the mean, we have chosen to compare people at the 40th percentile.&#13;
While representing a lower income group, this percentile also avoids&#13;
problems of data inconsistency found at lower percentiles.&#13;
The data for the nine family expenditure classes are utilized to&#13;
approximate continuous nominal expenditure distributions in the form of&#13;
Lorenz curves. Apart from providing income concentration comparisons,&#13;
these expenditure distributions enable us to measure the incidence of&#13;
poverty. Against the expenditure distributions, estimated poverty lines&#13;
are used to read off the number of people considered poor. Also measured&#13;
is the extent to which the incomes of the poor fall short of poverty&#13;
thresholds.&#13;
The poverty lines are built up from the cost of purchasing a&#13;
basket of what may be considered basic need food items. As in other&#13;
similar studies, nutritional requirements serve as a basis for estimating&#13;
the minimum food needs, while the actual non-food/food expenditure ratio&#13;
of a given low income group indicates the non-food needs.&#13;
1/ The latter is an approximation, since family sizes sometimes vary in&#13;
the neighborhood of the given percentile, making a difference for&#13;
expenditure classifications of the population according to whether a&#13;
family or per capita measure is used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Whether in constructing poverty lines or in comparing expenditure&#13;
levels, nominal magnitudes are deflated by location-specific&#13;
cost-of-living indices. Use of these price indices enables us to&#13;
represent income and poverty differences more accurately than otherwise.&#13;
The overall price index for any location relative to a national average is&#13;
a weighted average of food and non-food price indices. The food price&#13;
index is estimated directly from the ENDEF data on food expenditures and&#13;
quantities consumed. A non-food price index, on the other hand, is&#13;
approximated from the expenditure data, since no estimates of quantities&#13;
are available. Considering the tentative nature of this index, some&#13;
sensitivity tests were performed, and a lower and upper bound provided for&#13;
poverty measures based on them.&#13;
The approach for estimating the non-food price index is to apply&#13;
indirectly estimated income and price elasticities of demand for non-food&#13;
(indirectly from the food elasticities) to separate out what must be the&#13;
quantity difference in consumption while going from a hypothetical&#13;
national average location to any other place. The expenditure difference&#13;
remaining after separating out this quantity difference is attributed to&#13;
price variation. This method tends to include, in price differences, all&#13;
changes in non-food expenses, other than those occurring due to income and&#13;
price changes from the national average. Thus, additional expense on a&#13;
location specific need in an urban area (greater commuting, for instance)&#13;
is part of the price difference. This type of accounting may, in cases,&#13;
overstate price differences, and consequently help to understate the real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
expenditure or poverty variations between urban and rural areas. Some&#13;
independent estimates of housing price differences are also provided.&#13;
Cost-of-living indices are derived at the mean and the 40th&#13;
percentile alternatively using solely monetary expenditure and both&#13;
monetary and non-monetary expenditures. While the indices at the mean&#13;
clearly refer to qualitatively different consumption baskets across&#13;
regions, the comparisons at the 40th percentile presumably reduce this&#13;
problem. The inclusion of non-monetary components allows for a fuller&#13;
range of the price variation. Thus, the real magnitudes at the 40th&#13;
percentile based on monetary and non-monetary expenditure items are the&#13;
most appropriate ones for interregional comparisons. Such comparisons as&#13;
were possible in this paper represent one of the improvements in this&#13;
study over a previous one for Peru 1431, the overall approach of which is&#13;
applied and extended for Brazil in this study.&#13;
B. Living Costs&#13;
Section II presents estimates of spatial differences in food,&#13;
non-food and overall prices. In the case of food, first, a price index&#13;
at the mean is first calculated for deflating the mean nominal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expenditure. Second, a price index roughly at the 40th percentile 1/ is&#13;
presented for use in constructing poverty lines. The latter appears to be&#13;
a better indicator of food price differences, since under it much of the&#13;
quality differences at the mean are presumably eliminated. In each of&#13;
these cases spatial differences are augmented with the inclusion of&#13;
non-monetary consumption items. The rural situation is more accurately&#13;
represented by the inclusion of the usually cheaper items which are not&#13;
bought in the market and which are more important in the rural areas.&#13;
Significant regional price variation is brought out for a&#13;
composite basket of food items consumed at the national mean. The highest&#13;
prices, 11% to 21% above the national average, are observed in Regions I,&#13;
II and VI, which contain the metropolitan areas of Rio, Sao Paulo and&#13;
Brasilia respectively. Region VII, or the North, has comparable or higher&#13;
prices, but with the exclusion of rural areas, this region is not quite&#13;
comparable with the rest. Unfavorable production conditions and high&#13;
transportation costs from producing areas are, nevertheless, reflected in&#13;
these prices. Average or less than average prices are shown for the&#13;
relatively less urbanized regions IV and V. Region III is moderately&#13;
urbanized and has less than average prices, as explained by this region's&#13;
importance as an agricultural producer.&#13;
1/ See Annex Table 3 for a description.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Food price indices rise in going from the rural to the more&#13;
urbanized regions. Based on food expenditure (monetary plus non-monetary&#13;
expenditure) at the 20th percentile, the state of Rio de Janeiro (Region&#13;
I), the state of Sao Paulo (Region II), and Brasilia (Region VI), where&#13;
the percentages of urban population are high, show price levels that are&#13;
20-40% above the national average. The Northeast (Region V) and the&#13;
Centereast (Region IV), on the other hand, are less urbanized and show&#13;
a moderate price level. To these and the remaining regional comparisons,&#13;
the Frontier (Region VII) is not quite comparable since, as already&#13;
stated, rural areas are excluded. Urban-rural differences are more&#13;
clearly brought out in the comparison of the metropolitan average with the&#13;
rural average for the country as a whole. About a 30% above-average price&#13;
for the former contrasts with a more than 20% below-average price for the&#13;
latter.&#13;
Greater urban and regional variations are found in the case of&#13;
non-food than food. The non-food price indices are tentative and subject&#13;
to the caveats mentioned in Section II.B. Comparisons at the 40th&#13;
percentile seem reasonable, however, as some of the problems due to&#13;
quality variations are presumably removed. The results for the 40th&#13;
percentile are generally consistent with some independent estimates of&#13;
housing prices, as well as other scattered evidence and the opinion of&#13;
people familiar with the situation. Regions I, II and VI have prices well&#13;
above the average; with prices in their metropolitan areas, Rio, Sao Paulo&#13;
and Brasilia, are respectively 94%, 107% and 56% above average. Comparing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Region II with the more rural Region V, a 70% average price difference is&#13;
noted. A full calculation of rural prices has not been possible due to&#13;
data inconsistencies; but available results imply a metropolitan-rural&#13;
difference of about 100% for most regions.&#13;
Based on overall prices (i.e. weighted average of food and&#13;
non-food), we find higher costs of living in the apparently more affluent&#13;
and urbanized locations. Metropolitan Sao Paulo's prices are estimated to&#13;
be about 100% higher than the state's rural prices. Region II's prices&#13;
are roughly 50% higher than Region IV's. Metropolitan prices exceed the&#13;
national average by over 50%, while non-metropolitan urban prices&#13;
correspond roughly to the national average.&#13;
C. Income Inequality&#13;
Locational differences in per capita nominal expenditures are very&#13;
large, if cost-of-living differences are not accounted for, as reported&#13;
in Section II.A. The wealthiest regions in nominal terms are Regions I,&#13;
II and VI. Mean expenditures in these regions are about 50% above the&#13;
national average. The metropolitan areas of Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia&#13;
largely account for this. Regions IV and V are worst off with mean&#13;
expenditures of roughly 20% and 50% below the average. The income&#13;
positions of the rural areas in these regions largely account for this.&#13;
In general, metropolitan areas have roughly twice the mean national&#13;
average while rural areas have less than half. Non-metropolitan urban&#13;
areas' expenditure roughly corresponds to the average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
The above comparisons are based on total, i.e. monetary plus&#13;
non-monetary, expenditures. The use of total expenditure results in&#13;
smaller divergencies than monetary expenditures alone, since non-monetary&#13;
items are relatively more important in the more rural locations.&#13;
Comparisons at the 40th percentile of the expenditure distribution, as&#13;
opposed to the mean, also lower the spatial differences. The reason for&#13;
this, according to the ENDEF, is lower concentration of income in the more&#13;
rural areas 1/.&#13;
The more affluent locations spend the bulk of their additional&#13;
income on non-food. Yet, in absolute terms there exist considerable&#13;
differences in nominal expenses on food as well. These food expenditure&#13;
differences are, however, sharply reduced (and sometimes reversed) when&#13;
nominal magnitudes are deflated by price indices. In the case of&#13;
non-food, on the other hand, large spatial differences remain even in real&#13;
terms. Real variations for food and non-food total expenditures are&#13;
discussed in Section III.B.&#13;
In real terms, regional differences in food consumption may not be&#13;
very large. According to rough estimates for the 40th percentile of the&#13;
expenditure distribution, some of the less urbanized areas appear to do as&#13;
well or better than others. Nevertheless, consumption differences due to&#13;
1/ Rural landowners who live in cities form part of the city's income&#13;
distribution, which may partly explain the better rural income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
wide income variations across locations clearly persist. For instance, on&#13;
average, the low-income Northeast achieves only 71% of the consumption in&#13;
the high-income Sao Paulo state.&#13;
In the case of non-food, the more affluent and more urbanized&#13;
locations fare much better in real terms, whether we compare the mean or&#13;
the 40th percentile. In the latter case, the highly urbanized regions, I,&#13;
II, and VI, consume 100-150% more in real terms than the Northeast. On&#13;
the whole, metropolitan and urban consumption exceeds rural consumption&#13;
significantly.&#13;
Summing up results on food and non-food, we obtain total&#13;
consumption differences in real terms, most of which are due to&#13;
differences in non-food consumption. At the mean, estimated metropolitan&#13;
consumption exceeds other urban areas' consumption and rural areas'&#13;
consumption systematically. Comparing the 40th percentile, these&#13;
differences may be much smaller, with estimated consumption in&#13;
metropolitan areas as a whole being only 2% above that in other urban&#13;
areas, and 27% above that in rural areas.&#13;
D. Nutrition&#13;
In Section IV two alternative sets of nutritional norms are used&#13;
to evaluate nutritional adequacy. The first set provided by ENDEF&#13;
consistently states lower minimum requirements than the second derived by&#13;
Campino [4] from requirements established by the National Research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Council (USA). Consequently, two quite different pictures of the overall&#13;
nutritional position emerge. Based on ENDEF, the nation as a whole shows&#13;
a 5% calorie surplus. Based on Campino, a 3% deficit is indicated.&#13;
Spatial differences are small according to ENDEF. Based on&#13;
Campino, on the other hand, larger regional differences emerge. Calorie&#13;
deficits of 8-15% are shown for Regions I, V, VI and VII in contrast with&#13;
a 4-5% surplus for Regions II, III and IV. Urban-rural differences are&#13;
small, on the other hand, varying from a 5% deficit in metropolitan areas,&#13;
a 4% deficit in other urban areas and a 3% surplus in rural areas.&#13;
The type of urban-regional differences noted above reflect only&#13;
levels of caloric intake, which are consistent with findings on real food&#13;
consumption for lower income groups. The wealthier regions clearly fare&#13;
better than the poorer ones in their nutritional status. The nutritional&#13;
situation based on caloric adequacy is no worse in the rural areas than&#13;
in the more urbanized locations.&#13;
E. Poverty&#13;
Section V brings together estimated living costs, measures of food&#13;
and non-food needs and income distribution data to measure poverty.&#13;
Absolute poverty thresholds are constructed that take into account:&#13;
(i) nutritional needs, (ii) "minimum" non-food allowances, and (iii) their&#13;
cost differences. We focus on "medium" and "low" lines, excluding those&#13;
that are "high." Admittedly somewhat arbitrary, these are considered to&#13;
give "medium" and "low" poverty thresholds.  We have purposely adopted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
what may be thought of as conservative measures of poverty on grounds that&#13;
they may be more useful for policy.&#13;
A first poverty measure tells us the percentage and number of&#13;
people considered poor in each location. Irrespective of the poverty line&#13;
chosen, the bulk of the problem is in the Northeast and the rural areas.&#13;
On a "medium" poverty definition, over 29% of the nation's population is&#13;
considered poor. Nearly 50% of the Northeast would be poor according to&#13;
this definition. About half of the country's poor live in the Northeast.&#13;
Based on the same definition, about 20% in the state of Sao Paulo are&#13;
poor, constituting about 15% of the nation's poor. About 17% of the&#13;
metropolitan population fall below this poverty line, in comparison with&#13;
about 23% in other urban areas and about 39% in rural areas. "Low"&#13;
poverty lines would remove about 10-20% of the poor from the definition.&#13;
Combining the results of the percentage of poor with estimates of&#13;
the average poverty gap (i.e. income shortfall) and its distribution among&#13;
the poor, an index suggested by Sen [36] is constructed to give a fuller&#13;
measure of poverty. To the extent that the income distribution is worse&#13;
in the poorer regions, the "Sen index" brings out larger disparities. The&#13;
relative position of the rural areas is improved to the extent that the&#13;
ENDEF shows a better income distribution in these areas compared to the&#13;
urban ones. An alternative measure of income deficiency is given in&#13;
Thomas [43] by expressing the poverty gap as a fraction of each location's&#13;
income and multiplying it by the percentage of poor people. This measure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
indicates the percentage increase in the location's total income needed&#13;
over the existing situation, with all this increase going to the poor, to&#13;
eliminate poverty. Based on the "medium" definition of poverty, it is&#13;
suggested that over a 5% increase in the national income is needed, with a&#13;
10% increase in the Northeast and less than 2% in the state of Sao Paulo,&#13;
to remove the income deficiency of the poor.&#13;
F. Conclusion&#13;
Estimated cost of living indices vary widely within Brazil,&#13;
ranging roughly from 150 or more in the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de&#13;
Janeiro and Brasilia (compared to a national average of 100) to about 100&#13;
in the majority of small towns, and less than 90 in all rural areas.&#13;
These price differentials imply considerable variations in the purchasing&#13;
power across the country, but even after accounting for these, large&#13;
regional and urban-rural differences in the standard of living persist.&#13;
Comparing expenditure estimates, the divergencies narrow&#13;
considerably with the inclusion of non-monetary expenditure items, and&#13;
with comparisons at the 40th percentile of the expenditure distribution as&#13;
opposed to the mean.&#13;
For a lower income group defined as belonging to the 40th&#13;
percentile, expenditure in real terms in the metropolitan areas exceeds&#13;
that in other urban areas by an estimated 2%, and in rural areas by 27%.&#13;
Living standards of this income group in the medium-sized cities and towns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(places over 50,000 people that are not considered metropolitan areas) are&#13;
comparable to those in the metropolitan areas in real terms. Regional&#13;
differences, on the other hand, are large. People at the 40th percentile&#13;
in the state of Sao Paulo, for instance, are estimated to be twice as well&#13;
off as the Northeast in real terms.&#13;
In the case of food, the application of price indices removes a&#13;
large part of the urban-rural expenditure differences. In fact, the poor&#13;
in many rural areas may be achieving comparable or better nutritional&#13;
intake than their urban counterparts. Across regions, however, food&#13;
intake does vary substantially reflecting the large regional differences&#13;
in real incomes.&#13;
A large part of the urban-rural differences in real terms arises&#13;
from non-food consumption. This is significant considering that the&#13;
non-food price index in this paper may have overstated the true&#13;
urban-rural price differences. In spite of a markedly higher&#13;
non-food/food relative price in urban areas compared to rural zones, urban&#13;
dwellers consume relatively more non-food items than food compared to the&#13;
rural people. The higher urban income and the higher income elasticity&#13;
for non-food items relative to food are probably the main reasons. But&#13;
the question also relates to why urban dwellers with equal or higher real&#13;
incomes, in some cases, consume less food and more non-food than their&#13;
rural counterparts. Part of the explanation may lie in quality&#13;
differences of the items consumed. Urban consumption of certain non-food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
categories which are simply not available in rural areas may be another&#13;
part of the explanation.&#13;
Between urban and rural locations within regions, a major part of&#13;
differences in well-being arises from differences in the consumption of&#13;
non-food categories. This result points to large urban/rural disparities&#13;
within these regions in the availability of public goods and services and&#13;
the like, rather than in nutritional levels. But across regions,&#13;
differentials in mean food consumption are by no means insignificant, and&#13;
serious nutritional inadequacies are brought out in the case of some.&#13;
Various measures of poverty confirm the types of disparities&#13;
within Brazil noted thus far. A conservative definition of poverty at the&#13;
national aggregate level indicates that if a 5% increase in annual&#13;
national income above the levels existing in 1974/75 were entirely&#13;
directed towards the poor, everyone would have been at or above the&#13;
poverty line. The more interesting outcome of the poverty measures&#13;
undoubtedly points out that considerably more poverty exists in the&#13;
nation's rural areas than in urban areas. For instance, a poverty index&#13;
for the nation's rural areas is approximately 20. higher than the national&#13;
average, while that of the metropolitan areas is roughly 50% below&#13;
national averages. Compared to such urban-rural differences, however,&#13;
some regional differences, particularly between the Northeast and the&#13;
Southeast, are more striking. The sharpest contrast is provided by a&#13;
comparison of the state of Sao Paulo with the Northeast region. While a&#13;

II. Regional and Urban-Rural Variations in Living Costs&#13;
Large spatial differences in the cost of living exist within&#13;
Brazil. Price differences are experienced across regions and between&#13;
urban and rural areas. Cost variations for non-food categories are&#13;
clearly greater than for food items, although the magnitude of these&#13;
differences has yet to be fully and accurately quantified.&#13;
Several studies (see below) have brought out differences in food&#13;
prices. Such work has been facilitated by the availability of data on&#13;
food expenditures and quantities consumed for major regions and areas 1/.&#13;
Although food items vary in quality across locations, fairly reliable&#13;
price comparisons have been possible on the basis of available data. Cost&#13;
differences estimates for non-food categories, on the other hand, have&#13;
been hard to come by. Well-known problems in comparing these items across&#13;
places have stood in the way of developing estimates. FIBGE estimates&#13;
cost of living indices for major cities based on a basket of food and&#13;
non-food items 2/. While these are useful in indicating price changes over&#13;
1/  See FIBGE [131, [141, [151, FGV [91, [101, FIPE [111.&#13;
2/ Other institutes prepare independent estimates for individual cities, as&#13;
for example FIPE [11] for Sao Paulo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
time, their reliability for comparing prices spatially is limited by&#13;
tremendous differences in the baskets of non-food items considered.&#13;
In a recent World Bank study [201, comparisons were made of the&#13;
cost of meeting minimum calorie requirements across Brazil. Various food&#13;
baskets were compared using the ENDEF data for 1974/75 [12], [131 1/ and&#13;
in all cases, costs varied substantially. For instance, the cost of the&#13;
diet of a typical (i.e. average) family that just meets the minimum&#13;
requirements in metropolitan Sao Paulo exceeds that in the state's rural&#13;
areas by 2.1 times and that in the rural areas of the Northeast region by&#13;
2.7 times. Food cost differences within the Northeast have been reported&#13;
by Prado and Macedo [321. Using the ENDEF data for 1974/75, the cost of&#13;
an "average" basket in the city of Salvador was estimated to be about 25%&#13;
more than in the rural areas.&#13;
Williamson [45] has calculated price differences among 22 of the&#13;
ENDEF regions and areas for major food sub-groups. Inter-city price&#13;
differences have been estimated by Malard Meyer [26], also using the ENDEF&#13;
data. Hicks and Vetter [16] have measured the costs of "poverty line food&#13;
baskets" for various Brazilian cities.&#13;
Some measures of non-food cost variations for urban areas have&#13;
been made by Medeiros [271 using data provided by FIBGE. These measures&#13;
1/ Apart from these published data, some unpublished information for&#13;
the prices applicable to the people at the 20th percentile of the&#13;
expenditure distribution was also used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
are essentially expenditure differences for people within fairly small&#13;
income ranges (and thus considered comparable). For these people, all&#13;
expenditure differences were assumed to be price differences. Housing&#13;
cost in metropolitan Rio de Janeiro was estimated to be 2.2 times that in&#13;
non-metropolitan areas in the Nprtheast, and 2 times that in&#13;
non-metropolitan urban areas in the Southeast.&#13;
For overall cost of living differences, some approximations were&#13;
made by Pfeffermann and Webb [31]. Between metropolitan and other urban&#13;
areas, differences of 20% were indicated; between metropolitan and rural&#13;
areas diffferences of 30% were indicated.&#13;
Estimates of cost of living differentials are important in this&#13;
paper. They make expenditure data comparable across locations, and allow&#13;
measurement of spatial differences in the incidence of poverty. In the&#13;
rest of this section, we develop cost of living measures and discuss&#13;
results contained in Tables II.1 and Annex Table 5.&#13;
We use the ENDEF data to estimate food, non-food and overall&#13;
price indices for the seven major regions (see previous section), and&#13;
metropolitan, non-metropolitan urban and rural areas within those regions,&#13;
as well as for the country as a whole. A first measure compares people at&#13;
the mean. The ENDEF data reveal, however, that in different places,&#13;
people at the mean belong to quite different expenditure classes.&#13;
Consequently, price indices at the mean may be comparing the cost of&#13;
baskets of goods that are quite different qualitatively. To minimize this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
problem, a second measure attempts to compare people at the 40th&#13;
percentile of the expenditure distribution. The choice of the 40th&#13;
percentile enables us to compare the relatively poorer people, while&#13;
avoiding major inconsistencies in the data found at lower percentiles.&#13;
Placing people at the 40th percentile, however, is not straightforward&#13;
since available expenditure data distribute people within discrete&#13;
expenditure classes whose end points sometimes differ significantly from&#13;
the 40th percentile. We have tried to circumvent this problem by assuming&#13;
a normal expenditure distribution in the neighborhood of the 40th&#13;
percentile, thus approximating expenditure for the 40th percentile.&#13;
Published ENDEF data give expenditure distribution for families.&#13;
Using information on family sizes for expenditure classes, we have&#13;
constructed per capita expenditure distribution. If family sizes vary&#13;
widely across expenditure classes, this procedure can be misleading. In&#13;
the case of some rural areas this has been so. In the majority of the&#13;
other cases, however, in the neighborhood of the 40th percentile, family&#13;
sizes do not vary enough to cause problems.&#13;
A. Food Prices&#13;
It has been possible to calculate the prices of over 120&#13;
individual food items for the various regions and areas in 1974/75 on the&#13;
basis of the ENDEF data on family expenditures and quantities consumed /.&#13;
There exist alternative ways of weighting these prices across items and&#13;
1/ Prices of items consumed at restaurants have been omitted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
across locations to obtain spatial price indices for food. For a first&#13;
set of estimates, the approach adopted in this paper is to obtain the&#13;
spatial price differences of a basket of all food items in their national&#13;
average proportions. This corresponds to a Laspeyres price index 1/.&#13;
First, a price index for each of the food items has been&#13;
calculated 2/. The base for this index is the national price which has&#13;
been obtained by weighting each location's price by the location's&#13;
quantity weight in the national total. These price indices have then been&#13;
weighted across the various items using their respective expenditure&#13;
shares at the national level. The resulting price index for any location&#13;
reflects the difference in that location from the national price (assumed&#13;
to be 100) of a nationally consumed average basket of food.&#13;
Annex Tables 3 and 5 set out the price indices for ten major&#13;
sub-groups of food items and for a composite food bundle. Significant&#13;

2/ To see this, one may divide expenditure estimates in [13] by the cor-&#13;
responding quantity estimates in [121 for any item.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
price differences are indicated. Comparing metropolitan Sao Paulo, the&#13;
largest urban center, with adjacent rural areas (i.e. in Region II), for&#13;
instance, an urban-rural price difference of 14% is observed. Comparing&#13;
metropolitan Sao Paulo with the even more rural situation of the Northeast&#13;
(i.e. in Region V), a price difference of 35% is noted.&#13;
Regional difference is a part of the latter result. The aver-&#13;
age price in Sao Paulo state (i.e. Region II) is 16% higher than in the&#13;
Northeast, as summarized in Table II.1 below. Of the first five regions,&#13;
the first two containing, respectively, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have&#13;
higher food prices than Regions III, IV and V. It should be noted in&#13;
comparing these with the remaining two that Region VI is all urban&#13;
(Brasilia), and that rural areas are excluded from Region VII.&#13;
The results provide locational price differences of a nationally&#13;
consumed average basket of food items. A limitation of this approach,&#13;
however, lies in its use of national expenditure weights rather than of&#13;
location-specific ones. An alternative method would be to express at&#13;
national prices the cost of baskets of food consumed in each place. In&#13;
this procedure, corresponding to Paasche's price index, expenditure&#13;
weights of individual locations rather than the national averages would be&#13;
made use of 1/. Clearly, least-cost options available in individual&#13;
locations should be reflected. This would be best done by considering&#13;

price differences of low-cost location-specific food baskets rather than a&#13;
nationwide average basket. On the other hand, in indicating overall&#13;
spatial differences in food prices, it may be logical to first compare one&#13;
national composite food basket.&#13;
In this paper, we make use of the Laspeyres index to indicate&#13;
overall spatial price differences of food and to yield regional&#13;
comparisons of overall food consumption. In the construction of poverty&#13;
levels, on the other hand, the cost is compared between baskets of food,&#13;
maintaining their location-specific proportions. One price index based on&#13;
a location-specific consumption pattern is given in the second column of&#13;
Annex Table 5 and Table Il.1. This index, constructed from data in the&#13;
World Bank study [201, essentially shows the price differences of a food&#13;
basket consumed by people at the 20th percentile of the expenditure&#13;
distribution, maintaining each location's consumption pattern at that&#13;
income range. The large urban-rural price differences according to this&#13;
index reflect the ability of the poor in rural areas to meet minimum&#13;
nutritional needs at relatively low costs, if their own actual consumption&#13;
patterns were maintained.&#13;
Both the price indices show that food prices increase, going&#13;
from rural to urban areas and from the more rural to the more urbanized&#13;
regions. Regions I and II, as well as VI, where the percentage of urban&#13;
population is high (see Annex Table 2), consistently show a price level&#13;
well above the national average. Regions IV and V (Espirito Santo and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Minas Gerais), as well as Region III (the South), are less urbanized and&#13;
also face below national average prices.&#13;
The above price index based on the consumption pattern of the&#13;
20th percentile is the basis for one of the poverty measures presented&#13;
later in this paper (Annex Table 17, Column 3). In the use of a price&#13;
index to estimate poverty levels, as opposed to deflating incomes, an&#13;
issue is raised relating to the weighting of costs across locations to&#13;
obtain a national average. In the case of Laspeyres' or Paasche's price&#13;
indices, described earlier, weighting by quantities consumed of individual&#13;
items and by expenditures across items are appropriate. For use in&#13;
estimating the number of poor, or for measuring incomes needed to&#13;
eliminate poverty, the weighting of costs or prices must take into account&#13;
the number of people affected by the relevant costs or prices.&#13;
To take an example, if 80% of the national population who live&#13;
in location 1 face P1 and 20% in location 2 face P2 for a poverty basket&#13;
of food, the national average income needed to obtain one poverty basket&#13;
would be the average of P1 and P2 weighted by the respective population&#13;
weights, .8 and .2. Weighting by the quantities consumed in the two&#13;
locations would be inappropriate. Thus, in the section on poverty&#13;
measures, regional average and national average poverty levels are&#13;
constructed by weighting average location-specific poverty lines, using&#13;
population weights.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
B. Non-Food Prices&#13;
The ENDEF data for non-food do not permit derivation of price&#13;
indices as in the case of food because no estimates of the quantities&#13;
consumed are given. No other independent estimates of non-food prices&#13;
are available for the ENDEF regions and areas, even for the major items.&#13;
We have, therefore, tried to approximate spatial price ratios from&#13;
available data on expenditure differentials.&#13;
A given expenditure difference between two locations may be in&#13;
extreme cases entirely due to a price difference or to a quantity&#13;
difference. We have assumed that in reality only part of the difference&#13;
is due to a price difference, the rest being due to a quantity differ-&#13;
ence 1/. The non-food quantity difference is postulated to arise, on&#13;
the one hand, because money incomes (total expenditures) vary, and on the&#13;
other, because non-food prices vary. Differences in incomes along with an&#13;
income elasticity of demand, and difference in prices along with a price&#13;
elasticity of demand, together explain the non-food quantity variation.&#13;
To obtain a price ratio, with the national average as a base, we write the&#13;
known expenditure ratio between any location j and a hypothetical national&#13;
average (calculated) m as equal to the ratio between price in j and the&#13;
price in m (of 100) times the quantity ratio. The latter quantity ratio&#13;
1/ In the estimation of poverty lines, we provide lower and upper bound&#13;
estimates that would result if, respectively, all expenditure differ-&#13;
ences are assumed to be due to quantity differences, and due to price&#13;
differences. See Section V.D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
is related to the income and price differences between j and m and the&#13;
income and price elasticities at m. This helps us to solve for the price&#13;
in j as a proportion of the price in m of 100.&#13;
The above approach identifies the change in quantity consumed by&#13;
a hypothetical person who experiences a change in income and price in&#13;
going from m to j, leaving the remaining difference as the price&#13;
variation. The estimated quantity change is dictated by the elasticities&#13;
measured in the hypothetical average location (i.e., using d^ata for all&#13;
locations). This method will not fully identify differences in the&#13;
quantity consumed in a particular place that arise due to&#13;
location-specific needs. The procedure used, for instance, will not fully&#13;
reflect that part of the urban people's higher consumption arising purely&#13;
from their being city dwellers--for example, the larger quantities&#13;
consumed of transportation, clothing, and safety devices. Such quantity&#13;
differences, beyond those in the "average" location, will instead become&#13;
part of the price differences. This feature of our method is reasonable&#13;
insofar as this type of quantity differences does not enhance welfare&#13;
(e.g., urban dwellers are not better off because they travel more). If,&#13;
on the contrary, it contributes to welfare, the price index as calculated&#13;
in this paper for urban areas will be biased upwards.&#13;
To apply this method, price and income elasticities of demand&#13;
for non-food could not be calculated, since no data on quantities of -&#13;
non-food consumed were available. It has been possible, however, to use&#13;
estimated elasticities for food along with average budget shares of food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
and non-food to derive non-food elasticities, applying the Slutsky&#13;
equations [421. This above procedure was outlined, and an equation for&#13;
the non-food price index applied for the case of Peru in an earlier paper&#13;
[43J.&#13;
The main improvement in this study is that we develop estimates&#13;
restricting the comparison to the 40th percentile of the nominal&#13;
expenditure distribution, in addition to the comparison at the mean as&#13;
before. We believe that comparisons at the 40th percentile reduce the&#13;
quality differences inherent at the mean. The resultant price&#13;
differences, therefore, represent more accurately the difference in the&#13;
cost of a comparable basket.&#13;
To separate out the quantity variation from the expenditure&#13;
change across locations at the 40th percentile, we have calculated income&#13;
and price elasticities of demand for food at that income range using the&#13;
ENDEF data [38]. These are respectively 0.86 and -1.2. To be used for&#13;
transforming these food elasticities into non-food elasticities, national&#13;
average budget shares of food and non-food were calculated to be&#13;
respectively 0.4 and 0.6. For comparison, calculations have also been&#13;
made for the mean, in which case the demand elasticities of income and&#13;
price for food used were respectively 0.54 and -0.38 1/.&#13;
1/ For comparison with other countries, see [24], [28].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
The use of national budget shares and national elasticities is&#13;
analogous to the use of national weights to obtain regional prices&#13;
applying Laspeyres indices in the case of food 1/. Budget shares are&#13;
clearly non-uniform across regions (Annex Table 10), and the significant&#13;
urban-rural differences in price and income elasticities are bound to&#13;
exist. To provide an idea of the sensitivity of the results to varying&#13;
budget shares and elasticities, we tried a number of alternative&#13;
estimates. It turned out that in the application of the Slutsky&#13;
equations, such variations did not affect results significantly.&#13;
Income and price elasticities of demand at the 40th percentile&#13;
have been calculated using only data on monetary expenditure. These&#13;
elasticities indicate changes in the quantities purchased in the market as&#13;
a result of changes in money income and price. The resultant price index&#13;
reflects cost variation across locations of buying non-food categories in&#13;
the market. If non-monetary items were correctly and fully imputed in the&#13;
ENDEF data, their inclusion in the elasticity calculation should not alter&#13;
the above price index--except to the extent that the composition of items&#13;
may change with the inclusion of non-monetary expenditure items.&#13;
The reason why only monetary expenditure items have been used in&#13;
the above was that several inconsistencies were found in the data for the&#13;
40th percentile, particularly for rural areas when non-monetary components&#13;
1/ The alternative, analogous to Paasche's, would be to compare the&#13;
national average with each location as a base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
were included. For the mean, however, this problem was much less serious&#13;
except in a few rural areas. Therefore, we were able to utilize the total&#13;
expenditure data (i.e. monetary plus non-monetary) for this case.&#13;
Annex Table 5 provides the estimated price indices for the mean&#13;
and the 40th percentile. The wide price fluctuation at the mean&#13;
(Col. II, A) are reduced at the 40th percentile (Col. II,B). Comparing&#13;
the same range in the expenditure distribution, much of the heterogeneity&#13;
of the basket and quality of goods compared are likely to be reduced, thus&#13;
giving a smaller price divergence. It appears that the kinds of non-food&#13;
items consumed at the mean across Brazil vary widely, causing the large&#13;
apparent price variations in Col. II, A.&#13;
While the quality problem is by no means removed, a better&#13;
comparison of the price of a non-food basket is possible at the 40th&#13;
percentile in Col. II, B. Prices vary systematically, exceeding 100 in&#13;
the urban and relatively more urbanized regions, and falling below 100 in&#13;
the more rural locations. There is almost a one-to-one correspondence&#13;
between the price index and the degree of urbanization, going from&#13;
metropolitan Sao Paulo, Brasilia and metropolitan Rio de Janeiro to the&#13;
rural areas of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais and the Northeast. The&#13;
non-food price in metropolitan Sao Paulo is 165% higher than rural areas&#13;
in Region II. Table II.1 summarizes the non-food price variation among&#13;
the major regions and areas. A regional difference of 80% is recorded&#13;
between Region II and Region IV. Between the metropolitan areas and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
urban areas in the country as a whole, a price difference of 53% is&#13;
estimated.&#13;
Considering the limitations of the non-food price estimates&#13;
presented above, we tried to directly assemble price estimates for major&#13;
non-food categories. Work is underway at FIBGE in constructing price&#13;
indices for "comparable" housing and other major non-food categories. It&#13;
has not been possible to incorporate results of this work in this paper.&#13;
Presented are some independent calculations of housing price differentials&#13;
among several Brazilian cities.&#13;
The 1970 Demographic Census provides information on rents paid&#13;
by nine different rent groups in 126 urban municipalities located in the&#13;
states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Parana,&#13;
Santa Catarina, Rio Grande de Sul and Goias, and Brasilia. For&#13;
metropolitan areas within these states, several municipalities were&#13;
aggregated. It was possible to separate out the rent paid for four-room&#13;
urban houses serviced by water and sewer networks within these rent&#13;
groups. From this information, median rents were calculated for what may&#13;
roughly be considered comparable housing in each of the municipalities.&#13;
The results for the metropolitan areas and some other urban areas are&#13;
presented in Annex Table 4. Results for selected metropolitan areas are&#13;
given below.&#13;

C. Overall Prices&#13;
The overall price is a weighted average of the food and non-food&#13;
prices, the weights being the relative importance of these items in total&#13;
expenditure. Overall prices have been calculated using the non-food index&#13;
for the 40th percentile, and alternatively the food price index at the&#13;
mean and for the low-cost diet. The full range of likely price variation&#13;
within Brazil is shown based on these indices in Annex Table 5, which is&#13;
summarized in Table II.1. The more affluent and urbanized locations&#13;
clearly display higher price levels. At the mean, metropolitan Sao&#13;
Paulo's prices are roughly twice those in the state's rural areas and&#13;
about 1.25 times those in the rural areas of Regions III and IV. Region&#13;
II's prices are roughly 50% higher than in Regions III and IV. Compared&#13;
to the national average, the metropolitan areas' prices for lower income&#13;
groups are about 50% higher, while the rural areas' prices are probably&#13;
about 25% lower 1/. The non-metropolitan urban areas' prices correspond&#13;
roughly to the national average.&#13;
III. Spatial Inequality of Income&#13;
Wide disparities in incomes in Brazil have been documented 2/.&#13;
According to data presented-in the World Development Report [46], Brazil's&#13;
1/ Urban-rural comparisons are approximations for the Northeast and the&#13;
nation as a whole due to data problems in rural Northeast. See Table III.2.&#13;

income distribution in 1972 was more skewed than in most other countries&#13;
for which comparable data were available. The lowest 20% of households&#13;
shared only 2% of total household income while the top 10% gained 51%.&#13;
There has been much debate whether this situation has worsened in recent&#13;
years or not. Pfeffermann and Webb 131] bring out salient issues of this&#13;
debate.&#13;
Whether income distribution has been worsening or not, there is&#13;
little doubt that existing disparities are large. A major support for&#13;
this notion is the extent of visible backwardness of certain regions and&#13;
areas in relation to the rest of the country. The poverty found in the&#13;
Northeast, for instance, is in sharp contrast to the standard of living in&#13;
the Southeast. In this section we focus on the extent of sDatial&#13;
inequality of income, setting aside issues of interpersonal income&#13;
distribution and its change over time.&#13;
We draw on the results of the ENDEF survey to compare expenditure&#13;
levels across locations. Expenditure measures usually achieve better&#13;
coverage of total income than alternative income estimates from employment&#13;
surveys, for instance. ENDEF's expenditure estimates include measures for&#13;
non-monetary income as well. Three levels of expenditure include annual&#13;
expenses on food, clothing, housing, health, personal care, transport,&#13;
education and others. A second measure includes, in addition, taxes and&#13;
contribution. Global expenditure, a third measure, includes all other&#13;
acquisitions as well. The unit for all these measurements is the family.&#13;
The family sizes are also given so that per capita estimates can be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
The survey procedure and a detailed explanation of definitions and&#13;
concepts used can be found in FIBGE t133.&#13;
A. Nominal Expenditures&#13;
If cost of living differences were negligible, nominal&#13;
expenditures would reflect real income differences. But as shown in&#13;
Section 2, prices vary widely, and therefore nominal expendi'tures are&#13;
inaccurate measures of the real differences. Nevertheless, we first&#13;
examine nominal magnitudes, in part simply to indicate how income&#13;
variations are narrowed when nominal magnitudes are deflated by price&#13;
indices.&#13;
Annex Tables 6 and 7 present data compiled from ENDEF for various&#13;
types of expenditures by locations. Annex Table 8 and Table III.1 below&#13;
give these data in the form of indices (with the national average as a base)&#13;
to highlight the differences. These data reflect spatial divergencies in&#13;
the average nominal incomes. The wealthiest regions in nominal terms are&#13;
I, II and VI; their average incomes are generally 50% above the national&#13;
average. Regions IV and V are worst off with incomes roughly 20% to 50%,&#13;
respectively, below the national average. Incomes of Regions III and VII&#13;
roughly correspond to the national average.&#13;
The relative positions of Regions I, II and VI are largely due to&#13;
the income levels of their metropolitan areas -- Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
and Brasilia. Nominal incomes in all metropolitan areas -- except&#13;
Fortaleza and Recife in Region V -- are well above the national average.&#13;
Rural areas, on the other hand, fall well below the average. For the&#13;
nation as a whole, metropolitan areas have roughly twice the national&#13;
average and rural areas less than half. The non-metropolitan urban areas'&#13;
income roughly corresponds to the national average.&#13;
The variations are not uniform across types of expenditures.&#13;
Monetary expenditures always show greater variations. Clearly&#13;
non-monetary components are more important in the rural areas and the more&#13;
rural regions. The comparative positions of these locations are improved&#13;
with the inclusion of non-monetary items (compare Columns 1 and 2 in&#13;
Table III.1). Similarly the rural locations fare better when current&#13;
expenditures are compared rather than global. Acquisitions of a durable&#13;
nature are proportionately more important in the urban areas and the more&#13;
urban regions. Consumption expenditure improves the comparative position&#13;
of the rural locations further, indicating that taxes and contributions&#13;
are relatively less important in these places.&#13;
In general, the variance of non-food expenditure, whether&#13;
consumption, current or global, or whether monetary or non-monetary, is&#13;
far greater than of food. In Annex Table 7, the current expenses for&#13;
non-food of the metropolitan areas exceeds that of the other urban areas&#13;
by 2.2 times, and the rural areas by 5.7 times. In the case of food, on&#13;
the other hand, the metropolitan "other urban" divergence falls to 1.4 and&#13;
the metropolitan-rural to 1.7 (see Annex Tables 9 and 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Annex Table 11 shows the percentage distribution of major&#13;
consumption items in total current expenditure. Locations that are poorer&#13;
in terms of nominal income spend a greater proportion on food. Non-food&#13;
items, like housing and transport, explain the bulk of higher expenses in&#13;
the higher income locations.&#13;
Solorzano [38] has also estimated nominal expenditures of people&#13;
belonging to the 40th percentile of the expenditure distribution in each&#13;
place from ENDEF. A smooth continuous distribution of expenditure was&#13;
assumed in the neighborhood of the 40th percentile, permitting the&#13;
approximation of the expenditure of someone at that percentile that falls&#13;
between two discrete given intervals. Admittedly tentative, these&#13;
estimates enable us to compare people who belong to the same relative&#13;
position in the distribution in each place. The people compared also&#13;
constitute a lower income group than in the comparison of the mean.&#13;
Table III.3 summarizes the main urban and regional comparisons&#13;
at the 40th percentile. The broad differences observed at the mean in&#13;
nominal expenditures hold. It is noteworthy, however, that overall&#13;
differences are narrowed at the 40th percentile in comparison with the&#13;
mean 1/. If this were so at various percentiles below the mean, it would&#13;
imply a better income distribution in the more rural locations. But this&#13;
certainly cannot be concluded on the basis of the relative positions of&#13;
1/ Compare Tables III.2 and III.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
people at a single point. The 40th percentile is a high point in the&#13;
income distribution of the poor. It is possible that a larger&#13;
concentration of the poor below this point exists in the more rural&#13;
locations, giving them actually a worse overall income distribution than&#13;
the urban locations. It will be indicated in Section V that although the&#13;
ENDEF data point to a better income distribution in the rural areas, the&#13;
evidence is not cQnclusive.&#13;
B. Real Expenditures&#13;
Division of nominal expenditures on food and non-food by their&#13;
respective price indices yields real expenditures. The detailed results&#13;
for the mean are given in Annex Table 12. Also given in these tables are&#13;
the totals of the nominal and real magnitudes of the two categories.&#13;
These estimates show how spatial divergencies narrow when nominal figures&#13;
are deflated by price indices. The results for the major regions and&#13;
areas for the mean are summarized in Table III.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
1. Food Consumption&#13;
Nominal expenses vary less in the case of food than non-food. Yet&#13;
the more urban locations generally display significantly higher nominal&#13;
food expenditures. Deflation by the food price index changes this result.&#13;
As Tables III.2 and III.3 show, urban-rural differences are drastically&#13;
reduced, and in some cases, reversed. However, considerable regional&#13;
differences persist.&#13;
The narrowing of estimated food consumption is greater in the case&#13;
of total expenditure than if monetary expenditure alone were used (not&#13;
shown). The reason is that the rural locations have far greater&#13;
non-monetary components whose urban-rural price differences are larger&#13;
than for monetary items. Consequently, the use of price indices for total&#13;
expenses (i.e. monetary, plus non-monetary) raises real expenses of the&#13;
more rural locations relative to urban ones, more than in the use of price&#13;
indices based only on monetary expenses. The real total expenses on food&#13;
are thus generally more uniform across space.&#13;
Urban-rural gaps narrow more at the 40th percentile than at the&#13;
mean in most cases (Solorzano [38], Table 12). The reason of course is&#13;
that the food price index at the 40th percentile has a greater urban-rural&#13;
spread than at the mean (Annex Table 5).   The reason, suggested in&#13;
Section II, was that in comparing a relatively lower income group (i.e.,&#13;
people at the 40th percentile), relatively more purchase of inexpensive&#13;
items is allowed for in the rural than in the urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
To show the broad differences in food consumption within Brazil,&#13;
we refer to Tables III.2 and III.3. The former table for the mean&#13;
compares an "average" individual in each place; the latter for the 40th&#13;
percentile utilizes the price index for a more homogeneous basket in&#13;
comparing people at the same relative positions in the income scale. In&#13;
real terms regional differences in food consumption are reduced at the&#13;
mean and the 40th percentile. Although the gap in food intake, if&#13;
represented by real rather than nominal consumption, is considerably&#13;
narrowed one can observe significant disparities as related to income&#13;
differences among regions. The sharpest contrast is between the Northeast&#13;
and the rest of the country. Food consumption is the lowest in this&#13;
former region, which also has the lowest income levels.&#13;
The large urban-rural differences in nominal terms are also&#13;
sharply reduced when comparisons are made in real terms. Nevertheless, at&#13;
the mean, urban areas in general show greater food intake. When the&#13;
situation of lower income groups at the 40th percentile is considered,&#13;
however, the position of the rural people improves even further relative&#13;
to the urban group. Solorzano [38] suggests that in some instances rural&#13;
consumption of food in real terms might be even higher than that in the&#13;
metropolitan areas.&#13;
The possibility of better food intake in some rural areas is&#13;
supported in Section IV where comparisons are made of the percentages of&#13;
nutritional requirements achieved -- although judgments are made based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
only on caloric intake across the country. It is shown that while the&#13;
more rural areas among the high income regions -- viz. Regions II and III,&#13;
along with the moderately wealthy but largely rural Region IV -- achieve&#13;
the highest intake of calories absolutely and relative to requirements,&#13;
the other high income regions, I and VI, which are the most urbanized (see&#13;
Annex Table 1) perform worse. The nation's poorest region, the Northeast,&#13;
and particularly its metropolitan areas, remain worst off.&#13;
2. Non-Food Consumption&#13;
Nominal expenses on non-food items vary far more than on food.&#13;
The non-food price index also had a larger spread than the food price&#13;
index. Consequently, real expense differences are brought down more in&#13;
the case of non-food than food. Nevertheless, larger spatial divergencies&#13;
remain in non-food consumption than in food.&#13;
Unlike the case of food, price indices for non-food are based on&#13;
only one type of expenditure -- total non-food expenses for the mean and&#13;
only monetary non-food expenses for the 40th percentile (see Section II).&#13;
Although separate indices were calculated for the mean and the 40th&#13;
percentile, it was pointed out that substantial quality variations of&#13;
non-food items at the mean might render the index at the mean&#13;
unrepresentative. Solorzano [38] presents real expenses based on both&#13;
types of price indices, and Tables III.2 and III.3 summarize the main&#13;
results. A full comparison of regions and areas on the basis of the 40th&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
percentile, in particular, has not been possible due to inconsistencies in&#13;
the data for certain rural areas.&#13;
The more urbanized regions and the urban areas achieve a much&#13;
higher consumption of non-food categories than the rest of the country.&#13;
This is so at the mean and comparing the 40th percentile. People in&#13;
regions I, II and VI, with the largest metropolitan centers (Rio, Sao&#13;
Paulo and Brasilia, respectively) consume, on the average, more non-food&#13;
items than the national average 1/. The moderately urbanized Region III&#13;
also consumes a little over the average, while the largely rural Northeast&#13;
(Region V) and Region IV fall below the average. The Northeast consumes&#13;
less than half of Regions I, II and VI.&#13;
Non-food consumption thus appears to vary positively with not only&#13;
income but also the degree of urbanization. This is clearly brought out&#13;
in the comparison of areas. Contrary to the case of food, non-food&#13;
consumption in the metropolitan areas exceeds that in the urban areas&#13;
significantly at the 40th percentile. The gap Is 18%.&#13;
3. Total Consumption&#13;
Summing the food and non-food categories, we obtain total&#13;
consumption. In contrast to nominal expenditures, this resulting measure&#13;
1/ This is not very precise because the national average in this case had&#13;
to be calculated excluding rural Northeast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
of consumption (real) displays smaller spatial variance. The major part&#13;
of the remaining differences -- particularly if lower income groups are&#13;
compared -- arises from disparities in non-food consumption.&#13;
At the 40th percentile the overall metropolitan-urban-rural&#13;
variation is brought down considerably, but is by no means eliminated. An&#13;
estimated excess of metropolitan consumption over other urban areas of 2%&#13;
and over rural areas of 27% remains even when comparing people belonging&#13;
to the same position in expenditure distributions. At the mean, larger&#13;
urban-rural differences persist.&#13;

IV. Nutritional Adequacy&#13;
An often measured indicator of welfare is adequacy of food&#13;
consumption. This is not surprising since food is perhaps the most&#13;
fundamental of needs. Adequacy of food intake is usually assessed in&#13;
terms of the calories, the proteins and the vitamins associated with food&#13;
intake, which are then compared with certain established norms.&#13;
Nutritional standards are often also used to serve as a basis for&#13;
poverty measures, which will be the approach adopted in the next section.&#13;
Whether for evaluating food adequacy or for establishing poverty measures,&#13;
the cogency of nutritional norms has been questioned [3], [4], [51, [40],&#13;
[41]. The importance of taking great care in defining norms carefully and&#13;
estimating consumption accurately has come to receive much attention.&#13;
In the case of Brazil several nutritional studies are available&#13;
that use time series and cross sectional data. Many of these are cited in&#13;
the recent World Bank study [20], which gives a comprehensive account of&#13;
the nutritional situation in Brazil. This study makes extensive use of&#13;
the ENDEF data on food consumption and the ENDEF's nutritional norms. In&#13;
this section, we shall also present findings based on the ENDEF data and&#13;
norms for all the ENDEF regions and areas and compare them with an&#13;
alternative set of results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
A. Nutritional Norms&#13;
ENDEF provides data on ingestion requirements for the various&#13;
regions and areas. These are minimum requirements for the people sampled&#13;
in each location based on their age, sex, height, weight and activity&#13;
level. The ENDEF requirements for calories and proteins are given in&#13;
Annex Table 13.&#13;
The World Bank study [201 and Campino L41 point out that the&#13;
requirements according to ENDEF are likely to be biased downwards. The&#13;
degree of underestimation is more serious for the Northeast region.&#13;
Several factors contribute to the overall underestimation of requirements.&#13;
The use of height and weight alone does not allow for the additional&#13;
nutritional needs of children and the malnourished. Correction of the&#13;
activity level (or lack of it) also seems to understate the needs.&#13;
Comparing the ENDEF requirements with alternative standards, the&#13;
possible underestimation in the former is brought out. The World Bank&#13;
study 1201 compares the ENDEF norms with consistently higher ones derived&#13;
based on the FAQ/WHO standards L7].   Campino [51 has developed an&#13;
alternative set of norms based on a method for calculation of requirements&#13;
established by the National Research Council (NRC) in the USA [29].&#13;
Campino's results are for the major ENDEF regions. In Annex Table 13 we&#13;
present the requirements based on the NRC method for all the ENDEF&#13;
sub-regions and areas as well. The requirements for the Northeast,&#13;
according to these, are considerably higher than the ENDEF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
B. Achievement of Norms&#13;
ENDEF [12] provides data on calories and proteins consumed per&#13;
person per day for all regions and areas. These estimates are based on&#13;
estimated quantity of meals consumed at home and outside the home. Annex&#13;
Table 13 shows how much these estimated consumption levels represent in&#13;
percentage terms compared to alternative measures of requirements. Table&#13;
IV.1 below summarizes these findings for the major regions and areas.&#13;
Based on the ENDEF requirements, calorie deficits are found only&#13;
in Fortaleza, Salvador, Belem, and some other urban areas in Region VII.&#13;
The nation as a whole shows a surplus of about 5%. The picture changes&#13;
drastically, however, if the NRC-based requirements are used. Regions V,&#13;
VII, VI and I (in that order) do not fulfill minimium requirements, with&#13;
urban areas, in general, showing substantial deficits. The nation as a&#13;
whole achieves only about 97% of the calorie requirements, with all the&#13;
deficit (on the average) being distributed among the metropolitan and&#13;
other urban areas.&#13;
No protein deficit is found in any location, whether based on the&#13;
ENDEF or NRC requirements. The protein surplus derived on the ENDEF basis&#13;
is cut down sharply, however, in using the alternative standard.&#13;
Sharp spatial differences emerge in the nutritional position in&#13;
Brazil.  As Table IV.1 shows, Regions II and III are best off&#13;
nutritionally. These also happen to be the richer regions. It does not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
follow, however, that given the same real income, let alone money income,&#13;
similar nutritional positions would be achieved elsewhere. The highly&#13;
urbanized Regions I and VI, in spite of relatively high incomes, fail to&#13;
meet calorie requirements. At the same time, it is true that the very&#13;
poor regions also suffer the most serious problems of under-nourishment.&#13;
Regions V and VII are the poorest and also worst off nutritionally.&#13;
Region IV, also relatively poor, does better in its food consumption&#13;
except in the case of its own metropolitan area.&#13;
Serious incidence of malnutrition is identified in the&#13;
metropolitan areas in the poorest region V, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza,&#13;
and in Belem. The nutritional situation improves in the rural areas.&#13;
The World Bank study [201, presents findings on the calorie&#13;
deficit at various ranges of the family expenditure distribution. At the&#13;
20th percentile, sizable per capita deficit is shown everywhere, in&#13;
relation to FAO/WHO requirements. These deficits vary considerably but on&#13;
average, the estimated per capita deficits in the metropolitan, other&#13;
urban and rural areas of the country are, respectively, 492,447 and 328.&#13;
The most serious malnutrition among the poor is in the Northeast,&#13;
particularly in Salvador and Fortaleza an(r Recife, with deficits,&#13;
respectively, of 687, 668 and 598.&#13;

V. Differences in Poverty Within Brazil&#13;
In this section we use t1le exoend ture data and price indices'&#13;
discussed thus far to deveiop measures of Doverty. The approach is to&#13;
first construct expendit-ur-e le-els  &gt;eat may be considered to represent&#13;
absolute poverty levels I/.  These expenditure levels include minimum&#13;
expenses on food and non-food categorles   Given price differences, these&#13;
"required" expenditures vary from pl2ace to place.  Expenditure&#13;
distribution data are then used  Qo reac off how many people actually spend&#13;
less than the minimum require-Lm&lt;ents, giving the percentages of people&#13;
considered poor across locations. Ar, effort is also made to show by how&#13;
much the expenditures of the poor fall short of the poverty thresholds.&#13;
Considering the subjects -vity ivclved in defining absolute&#13;
poverty, numerous poverty lines can be conistructed even while confining&#13;
oneself to an inexpensive consumat i.on basket (Solorzano [38j).  We have&#13;
calculated various measures, but include three of them based on low cost&#13;
food consumption baskets.  The resulting poverty estimates should&#13;
therefore be considered as conservative measures. The difference between&#13;
the three measures arises from the choice of the minimum nutritional&#13;
requirement, the food basket that achieves that requirement, and the&#13;
differences in the price of tbe basket considered.&#13;
As mentioned in Sect7on IT the price difference of one of the&#13;
baskets (Type A below) is the basis for the food price index, considered&#13;
1/ See Ahluwalia [1], Anand [21, [161, Orshansky [30], Prado and Macedo&#13;
[32], Sen [35], [36], Srinivasan [393, [403, Thomas [43].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
relevant for the poor (Annex Table 5, column 2)o This basket consists of&#13;
food items in proportions actually consumed by people at the 20th&#13;
percentile. A second basket (Type B belew), aims at providing a lower&#13;
cost figure by confining to items that contribute 75% of the calories.  A&#13;
third basket (Type C), is even imore restrict`ve and low cost since only&#13;
cereals -- in their actual proportion - are considered.&#13;
Food price differences reflecred `y the cost of these baskets&#13;
would be different from the food prJce  inex.x ,ased on average consumption&#13;
of all items at the mean (Section IT', for three reasons. First, the&#13;
baskets considered are different ,From those at the mean. Second, the&#13;
prices of the items at the lower income groups are different than at the&#13;
mean. (This may be due to qual'ty differences a-nid other factors.) Third,&#13;
the average cost of a poverty diet at the nat:ional level is calculated&#13;
using population weights rather than consumoc1on weights for reasons given&#13;
in Section II.&#13;
In all the three cases, the natLon-al non-food/food expenditure&#13;
ratio of the 40th percentile times the non-fIo,  price index for the 20th&#13;
percentile is used to derive ..inimu.m  non-fcod allo-wances9  The sum of the&#13;
minimum food and non-food expenses gi,7es th- poverty lines.&#13;
A,   oo  tosts&#13;
The basis of our meas-ure of She r-v7e_ry line is the cost of buying&#13;
a basic basket of food that providea  the Jminimum requirement of calories&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
and proteins.  Two types of nutritional requirements are used.  In one the&#13;
results of the NRC-based Campino study [5] are used to allow for varying&#13;
average nutritional needs in various locations. Alternatively, the same&#13;
national requirement of FAO/WHO of 2,242 calories per person daily is used&#13;
for all places. In all these cases, the protein requirements are&#13;
automatically met, once the recommended calories are satisfied.&#13;
1. Type A Food Basket&#13;
The same FAO/WHO based national calorie requirement of 2,242 is&#13;
considered for all places in constructing the type A basket. The food&#13;
items used to meet this requirement are those consumed at the 20th&#13;
percentile of the expenditure (monetary and non-monetary) distribution in&#13;
each location. The quantity of these items is adjusted to meet the&#13;
caloric requirements, which in most cases are achieved by people around&#13;
the 40th percentile of the expenditure distribution. The prices used for&#13;
costing this basket are those relevant to the 20th percentile. The cost&#13;
of such a basket was calculated in the World Bank's Human Resources&#13;
Special Report [201, which is given in Column 1 of Annex Table 17.&#13;
The poverty measure based on the type A food basket falls&#13;
substantially below ones based on consumption patterns and prices at the&#13;
mean (Solorzano [38]). At the same time, it is above the other measures&#13;
reported in this study. Therefore it is considered the basis for a&#13;
"medium level" poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
An alternative measure was considered, based on the same food&#13;
composition as in A, but allowing the nutritional requirements to vary&#13;
according to [29]. The resulting differences are small, and so this&#13;
measure is not used as a basis for the poverty line.&#13;
2.  Type B Food Basket&#13;
In order to obtain a low cost diet, we choose for this basket only&#13;
the major food items that actually provide 75% of calories per person at&#13;
the mean in each location. The caloric requirements are allowed to vary&#13;
according to the NRC-based calculation for each place. The quantity of&#13;
items (that constitute 75% of calories) is adjusted proportionately so as&#13;
to satisfy these calorie standards.&#13;
Annex Table 14 sets out the calorie composition of the type B&#13;
basket by the major food items. Six to nine items provide 75% of calorie&#13;
at the mean in each location. The importance of individual items varies&#13;
considerably. Rice, bread and cassava are generally the most important&#13;
items, in terms of calories, followed by sugar, beans and oils. Annex&#13;
Table 15 provides details on the actual ordering of the various items&#13;
across locations. Prices of these items are also given.&#13;
Type B basket for each place is costed out in Annex Table 16. The&#13;
total cost per person is given in the final column and repeated in column&#13;
2 of Annex Table 18. Type B may be considered a low cost basket. It will&#13;
be used as the basis for poverty line called "low 1."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
3. Type C Food Basket&#13;
The lowest cost basket, type C, is composed only of cereals. The&#13;
composition of cereals is determined by their actual proportion in the&#13;
average diet in each location. The same 2,242 calories per day is sought&#13;
to be met in all places by adjusting the quantities of cereals&#13;
proportionately.&#13;
The cost of this basket was calculated in the World Bank study&#13;
[20] and repeated in column 3 of Annex Table 17. This basket gives the&#13;
lowest food cost, and hence is used as the basis for a "low 2" poverty&#13;
line.&#13;
B. Non-Food Cost and Poverty Lines&#13;
Ideally a basic non-food basket should be defined and costed for&#13;
each location as in the case of food. However, unlike the nutritional&#13;
norms for food, no simple method exists to define a minimum non-food&#13;
requirement. We have therefore used an observed non-food/food expenditure&#13;
ratio for the poor to define a minimum required non-food allowance. We&#13;
have then applied the non-food price indices developed in Section II to&#13;
derive location specific non-food allowance.&#13;
In the final row under A' through C', national average&#13;
requirements for non-food are given. Each of them is the product of the&#13;
cost of a different food basket (type A through C) and the non-food/food&#13;
expenditure ratio for the 20th percentile for the country as a whole of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
0.7. The rest of the estimates under A' through C' are products of the&#13;
national non-food requirement and the non-food price index at the 40th&#13;
percentile. The variations in the non-food cost across locations reflect&#13;
the spatial differences in non-food prices brought out in Section II.&#13;
The final columns in Annex Table 17 give the sum of the food costs&#13;
for each basket type and its corresponding non-food cost. These are the&#13;
poverty lines.&#13;
Table V.1 summarizes variations in the poverty lines for the major&#13;
regions and areas. Regional differences are largest betweenL the state of&#13;
Sao Paulo and the Northeast. According to the three poverty lines, to buy&#13;
the same quantities of minimum requirements, 50-60% higher nominal&#13;
expenditures are needed in Sao Paulo state than in the Northeast.&#13;
Urban-rural differences are greater. A similar basket of basic needs&#13;
costs 70-90% more in the metropolitan areas than in the rural areas. The&#13;
non-metropolitan urban areas fall roughly half way between these, and&#13;
correspond to the national average.&#13;
C. Income Distribution&#13;
Apart from the cost of living-based poverty lines, data on&#13;
regional income distribution are the chief information needed for&#13;
constructing poverty measures. Income distribution schedules and measures&#13;
for many of the ENDEF locations have been provided by Hoffman [171,&#13;
Langoni [21] and Lodder [221 based on the 1970 Demographic Census.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
also be found in Lluch [23], Macedo [25], Pfeffermann and Webb [31], Prado&#13;
and Macedo [32].&#13;
To provide a consistent set of income distribution data for all&#13;
the ENDEF locations which can then be compared with the ENDEF-based&#13;
poverty lines, we tabulate family and per capita expenditure distributions&#13;
directly from the ENDEF survey. These expenditure survey-based income&#13;
distribution measures tend to show a lesser concentration of income&#13;
compared to the demographic census-based estimates mentioned. One reason&#13;
is that the expenditure data reflect permanent income better than the&#13;
income data. Under the latter, income-in-kind and secondary incomes are&#13;
often underreported. The expenditure-based distribution captures better&#13;
the income of lower income groups thereby showing a lower concentration&#13;
than the income-based distribution. The ENDEF also excludes those with&#13;
insignificant expenditure, thereby understating the degree of&#13;
concentration. Perhaps partly for these reasons, the ENDEF also shows a&#13;
consistent and significant lower income concentration in the rural areas&#13;
than in the urban zones, more than showed up in the income-based estimate&#13;
mentioned above. Annex Table 18 sets out estimated Gini coefficients&#13;
based on the ENDEF data and compares them with results obtained from the&#13;
1970 demographic census.&#13;
For the calculation of the Gini coefficients and for the&#13;
estimation of poverty measures, we characterize the discrete expenditure&#13;
distribution contained in the ENDEF in the form of a continuous Lorenz&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
curve. We fitted a Lorenz curve with the nine observations for each&#13;
location, using the method suggested in Ahluwalia [1] and Kakwani and&#13;
Podder [19]. Discrepancies in the ENDEF data for extreme values&#13;
(particularly the first two deciles and the last) affected the results in&#13;
several cases. Geometric approximation of an expenditure distribution in&#13;
the neighborhood of the poverty line had to be relied upon instead. This&#13;
yielded an estimate of the percentage of people considered poor. In the&#13;
neighborhood of this estimate a Lorenz curve was also geometrically fitted&#13;
to enable the calculation of income of the poor.&#13;
D. Poverty Measures&#13;
A first measure of poverty is simply the percentage of people that&#13;
falls below the poverty lines. Annex Table 17 and Table V.1 give three&#13;
alternative poverty lines considered to be conservative estimates. From&#13;
Annex Table 17, one may first choose "the medium" poverty line given by&#13;
A + A' for constructing a first poverty measure. Using the expenditure&#13;
distribution, we read off the percentage and the number of people with&#13;
expenditures below this threshold (see the previous sub-section) 1/.&#13;
The results are given in Annex Table 19 and Table V.2. The&#13;
"medium" definition implies that over 29% of the nation's population are&#13;
poor comparable to the 28% estimated by Pfeffermann and Webb [31]. Their&#13;
1/ To see this, one may take the estimated poverty lines and compare with&#13;
data on population by expenditure classes given in ENDEF (FIBGE[13]).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
spatial distribution is very uneven, with great concentrations in the,&#13;
Northeast and rural areas. About 14 million people in the Northeast are&#13;
considered poor, which is also about the size of rural population defined&#13;
as poor.&#13;
Some degree of arbitariness involved in the choice and application&#13;
of poverty lines is evident, in comparing results based on alternative&#13;
thresholds. If the "low" definition of poverty given in section V.B were&#13;
adopted, obviously much lower numbers would be defined as poor -- 23% -&#13;
24% according to Solorzano [38]. More liberal allowance for non-food&#13;
expenditure would raise the poverty lines, and the number defined poor,&#13;
probably significantly.&#13;
Given the tentative nature of the non-food price index in this&#13;
paper, one should interpret carefully the poverty results based on them.&#13;
Two results that have emerged on their basis are, however, important and&#13;
robust. First, the relative positions of locations in the incidence of&#13;
poverty are broadly maintained under alternative definitions of poverty.&#13;
Thus, whether one adopts low, medium or high definitions of poverty, the&#13;
types of disparities brought out in this paper are likely to remain.&#13;
Second, the use of the non-food price index, as presented in this&#13;
paper, is likely to have given a more accurate presentation of the poverty&#13;
profile than otherwise. Two alternatives would have been, first, to&#13;
assume that all non-food expenditure differences are price differences,&#13;
and second to assume that all non-food expenditure differences are real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(quantity) differences. Under the first assumption, larger than necessary&#13;
urban-rural differences in poverty lines would be adopted, resulting in&#13;
smaller spatial differences in the incidence of poverty than found in this&#13;
paper. Under the second assumption, a uniform non-food allowance would be&#13;
built in with the poverty line resulting in wider spatial differences than&#13;
suggested in this paper.&#13;
Both the above alternatives have been tried, in both cases&#13;
assuming the same food expenditure. The summary results are given in&#13;
Table V.2. The first column repeats results based on the "medium" poverty&#13;
definition. The second column gives poverty estimates that would result&#13;
if the actual non-food/food ratios in each location were assumed necessary&#13;
to meet minimum needs. Thus the full difference in observed expenditures&#13;
on non-food is assumed to be due to price differences, which in reality&#13;
would be an exaggeration. Consequently poverty differences on this basis&#13;
would understate true differences. This is readily seen by comparing the&#13;
regions or urban-rural areas in Table V.2. The third column assumes the&#13;
same non-food allowance calculated at the national level, as for the&#13;
medium definition, to be sufficient in all regions. This presumes no&#13;
spatial price differences, and as a result, exaggerates the variation in&#13;
poverty. For instance, in the last column of Table V.2 the percentage&#13;
defined poor in rural areas on the basis of this definition, is four times&#13;
that in the metropolitan areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
The above indices only dealt with the percentage of people&#13;
considered poor. A second measure of poverty takes into account both the&#13;
percentage of people who are poor and the extent of their poverty. The&#13;
Sen Index given below (I) considers both these components of poverty.&#13;
N    Y* - Y(1 - G )&#13;
(N ) C       Y*M]l(V.1)&#13;
N&#13;
where Np is the number of poor and N the total population; Y* is the&#13;
poverty line and Yp the average income (expenditure) of the poor; Gp is&#13;
the Gini coefficient of consumption of the poor.&#13;
If all poor have the same income ((i.e. Gp= 0)), the index is&#13;
the product of the percentage of poor people and the proportion amount of&#13;
income shortfall from the poverty line. If the distribution of income&#13;
among the poor is also important, (1 - Gp) weights Yp such that a worse&#13;
distribution results in a larger poverty index.&#13;
Suppose we ignore the distribution of income among the poor and&#13;
express the poverty gap (Y* - Yp) as a fraction of the averdge income of&#13;
the location Y (rather than Y*). This tells us the percentage of a&#13;
location's existing total income that is needed to be directed to the poor&#13;
to enable them to cross the poverty level. This index I', taken from&#13;
Thomas [43], is given below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
N    y*._ y&#13;
N( N) (                                      (V. 2)&#13;
where Y is the average income of the region.&#13;
Annex Table 19 and Table V.2 present estimates of equations (V.1)&#13;
and (V.2) based on the "medium" poverty line. Broad differences in&#13;
poverty implied by these indices are similar to the ones given by the&#13;
percentage poor, but some of the urban-rural differences are reduced due&#13;
to the better rural income distribution implied in the ENDEF. Some of the&#13;
regional differences are augmented, also because some of the poorer&#13;
regions have worse income distributions.&#13;
Referring to equation (V.2), it is indicated that in order to&#13;
enable everyone to have income equal to or above a "medium" poverty line,&#13;
over a 5% increase in annual national income is needed (over the actual&#13;
increase in 1974/75), and all of this increase would go to the poor. The&#13;
spatial distribution of this needed increase is very uneven, however. In&#13;
the case of the Northeast the required increase is 10% compared to less&#13;
than 2% in the state of Sao Paulo. For the rural areas as a whole a 10%&#13;
increase is needed as compared to over 2% in the metropolitan areas.&#13;

            Differences in income, nutrition and
            poverty within Brazil
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Regional disparities in living standards
            within Brazil have received increasing attention in recent
            years. This paper attempts to throw light on this issue by
            providing a quantitative range for these differences.
            Drawing on the national consumption survey called ENDEF for
            1974/75, estimates are set out for real income, nutritional
            levels and poverty for major regions, and urban and rural
            areas. The results of this study indicate that, although
            cost of living adjustments narrow spatial differences, large
            regional disparities remain, particularly upon comparing the
            Northeast and the Southeast. The use of cost of living
            indices reduces urban-rural variations more than in the case
            of regional differences, drastically narrowing the
            urban-rural gap in food consumption. Poverty is,
            nevertheless, much more concentrated in the rural areas than
            in urban areas, although regional differences in the
            incidence of poverty are more striking than the urban-rural divergencies.
