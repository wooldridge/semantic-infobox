&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since the end of the 1990s, the water supply and sanitation    the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) figures, meeting&#13;
sector in Niger has undergone a large number of reforms;       the MDG targets will require that services are provided&#13;
these have had a profound effect on both the institutional     to an additional 855,000 people per year for drinking&#13;
landscape and the means of intervention of the relevant        water and an additional 1,248,000 people per year for&#13;
ministries and the stateâ&#128;&#153;s technical departments. As in        sanitation.&#13;
many countries in the subregion, the decentralization&#13;
process has placed the communes at the heart of the sector     The target for drinking water remains achievable, but&#13;
even though communes do not yet have the capacity to           only if the government makes this a national priority&#13;
carry out their newly allocated roles, particularly that of    and provided that this priority is supported by a robust&#13;
acting as the contracting authority for the construction of    investment program. However, it will be far more difficult&#13;
infrastructure.                                                to achieve the target for sanitation by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
When current access rates are compared to targets, it is       The prospects for investment are mixed, as the RWS&#13;
evident that the overall pace of infrastructure construction   subsector is severely underfunded. To address this, major&#13;
still needs to be accelerated, despite considerable efforts    financial commitments will need to be obtained from&#13;
having been made in the urban water supply (UWS) and           development partners through the National Water Supply&#13;
the progress in the rural water supply (RWS) subsector.        and Sanitation Program (PNAEPA: Programme National&#13;
The situation in the sanitation and hygiene subsector          dâ&#128;&#153;Alimentation dâ&#128;&#153;Eau Potable et de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement),&#13;
needs particular attention as access rates are exceedingly     which is a central tool for the sector. However, to accelerate&#13;
low, especially in rural areas.                                mobilization of the financing required to implement the&#13;

According to the figures provided by the government,           be seen to stabilize.&#13;
achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets&#13;
will require providing services to an additional 514,000       This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2)&#13;
people per year for drinking water and an additional           has been produced in collaboration with the Government&#13;
1,361,000 people per year for sanitation. According to         of Niger and other stakeholders.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Continue the transfer of water supply and sanitation related competencies to communes, with back-up support from&#13;
       deconcentrated technical departments.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Clarify the institutional context for sanitation and hygiene and, in particular, the leadership role of the Directorate of&#13;
       Basic Sanitation (DAB: Direction de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement de Base).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Revitalize the National Water and Sanitation Commission, increase the frequency of meetings, and reinforce the&#13;
       secretariat.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Ensure dialogue is maintained between stakeholders within the water supply and sanitation sector, notably through&#13;
       the consultation framework.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Continue to use the objective-based program budget/Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (BPO/MTEF) tool by&#13;
       improving the way in which this is linked to the financial planning carried out at the commune level.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop financing strategy within the sanitation and hygiene subsector, as both rural and urban areas are currently&#13;
       suffering from severe underinvestment.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improve the way in which nongovernmental financing is taken into account in the monitoring tools developed within&#13;
       the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop the monitoring and evaluation framework for sanitation and hygiene (both in rural and urban areas) on which&#13;
       work is currently at a standstill.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Harmonize the JMP and government approaches and identify areas of similarity between the two.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Monitor the new 2009 indicators, which provide a much more refined analysis of the progress and issues associated&#13;
       with providing sustainable access.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Actively seek new financing to overcome the funding deficit which is currently preventing both the MDG targets&#13;
       from being achieved and the PNAEPA from being properly implemented.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop a common financing tool for the subsector, as per the recommendation of the 2010 joint sector review.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Continue the Local Water and Sanitation Plan approach with a view to ensuring this becomes the principle tool used&#13;
       for concerted planning at local level.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Widely distribute the Guide to Water Supply Services within the Rural Water Supply Subsector and supplement this&#13;
       with the targeted training of communes and operators.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop a communication strategy for WSS in rural areas.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Reinforce the monitoring of indicators at the commune level, ensuring this is aligned to the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
       approach used at the national level.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Expand the use of the technical, accounting, and financial monitoring undertaken by the SAC-SPE (Back-up Support&#13;
       Structure for the Public Water Service) to all water service operators in rural areas and delegatee communes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                          3&#13;
                                                                                                                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;An AMCOW Country Status Overview&#13;

         master plan.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Maintain the quality of service to users and, particularly, the quality of the water distributed, including in secondary&#13;
         towns.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Direct investment towards poor and disadvantaged users, particularly in the outlying settlements of Niamey and&#13;
         secondary towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Ensure sanitation and hygiene in rural areas becomes a real political priority, which is reflected in the national&#13;
         budget.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Reinforce the intervention capacities of the newly created Directorate of Basic Sanitation (Direction de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement&#13;
         de Base).&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Develop pilot Community-Led Total Sanitation programs and scale up this approach should the pilots prove&#13;
         successful.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Improve the way in which sanitation and hygiene is dealt with in nationally conducted household surveys.&#13;

&#13;
1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Niger and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

&#13;
â&#128;¢	 If the JMP figures are used, the ratio stands at 3.64 for             Investment Requirements: Testing the&#13;
   drinking waterâ&#128;&#148;which means that, between now and                      Sufficiency of Finance&#13;
   2015, there needs to be an almost fourfold increase&#13;
   in the efforts made between 1990 and 2008 if the                      The CSO2 costing methodology also provides an estimate&#13;
   MDG targets are to be met. For sanitation, however,                   of the amount to be invested in each subsector and the&#13;
   this ratio stands at 23.65â&#128;&#148;which will be a far more                   proportion of this amount that corresponds to public&#13;
   considerable challenge.                                               investment. The anticipated financial flows for this estimate&#13;
â&#128;¢	 If the figures utilized by the GoN for 2009 and 2015                  is based on the 2011â&#128;&#147;13 objective-based program budget&#13;
   are used, these same ratios equate to 1.89 for drinking               (BPO: Budget Programme par Objectifs) which corresponds&#13;
   water and 13.75 for sanitation.                                       to the financing acquired and that which is likely to be&#13;

The difference in these ratios can be explained by the&#13;
fact that the MDG target for sanitation set by the GoN                   Based on the CSO2 estimate, investment of US$100&#13;
is slightly lower than the target calculated using the JMP               million per year will be required to meet drinking water&#13;
data; in addition, the GoNâ&#128;&#153;s MDG target for drinking water               targets and US$59 million for sanitation (see Figure 2 and&#13;
is significantly lower than the target determined using                  Table 1). For the 2009â&#128;&#147;15 period, the total investment&#13;
JMP data (58 percent compared to 68 percent). However,                   requirements stand at US$1,113 million for drinking water&#13;
regardless of the target used, far greater efforts will be               and sanitation. Nearly 75 percent of this investment needs&#13;
required for sanitation than for drinking water.                         to be allocated to rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
To achieve the MDG target for drinking water, access                     It is important to note that the investment considered&#13;
needs to be provided to an additional 855,000 (JMP)                      in the calculation only relates to drinking water and&#13;
or 514,000 people (GoN) per year between 2009 and                        household sanitation facilities that are to be constructed&#13;
2015. For sanitation, an additional 1,248,000 (JMP) or                   and rehabilitated to meet the MDG targets and exclude,&#13;
1,361,000 (GoN) people per year need to be provided                      for instance, studies and upfront investment required for&#13;
with access to an acceptable sanitation facility between                 mobilizing water resources, awareness-raising and hygiene&#13;
2009 and 2015â&#128;&#148;even assuming that sanitation facilities                   education activities, as well as industrial sanitation and&#13;
are to be largely self-financed by households, this remains              wastewater treatment plants.&#13;

The decentralization laws recognize the local authorities         ensure planning is better aligned. The Project Coordination&#13;

for water supply facilities. However, the communes                boasts a coherent action and investment plan and the&#13;
have still not fully taken on this role as the transfer of        master plan has recently been updated.&#13;
competencies and resources has not yet taken effect.&#13;
                                                                  For the RWS subsector, the planning effort continues but&#13;
The vast majority of communes in Niger (213 out of a total        is being hampered by several different factors: (a) the lack&#13;
of 266 existing communes) are grouped together within             of capacity within communes to carry out this planning; (b)&#13;
the Association of Municipalities (AMN: Association des           the lack of practical experience and resources within the&#13;
MunicipalitÃ©s du Niger). The aim of this association is           decentralized departments to support the communes in this&#13;
to act as a link between the communes and the public              task; (c) the current weaknesses of the M&amp;E framework (see&#13;
authorities for all areas that come under the communesâ&#128;&#153;           Section 6); and (d) the absence of a planning framework&#13;
remit. However, the AMN does not currently consider the           at the national level to promote this approach. Here again,&#13;
WSS sector as an area for priority action.                        the foundations have been laid by the PNAEPA, but a lot&#13;
                                                                  more needs to be done to make this operational.&#13;
Coordination of DPs is undertaken through a consultative&#13;
framework that meets regularly and defines DP common              In 2006, the government set up a consultative body for&#13;

For planning, the situation varies for each subsector.&#13;
In general, the implementation of the objective-based&#13;
                                                                  The CNEA is composed of 55 members representing seven&#13;

been a highly positive development, even though not all&#13;
                                                                  (eight members), nongovernmental organizations&#13;
partners are yet required to use this tool, meaning that its      (NGOs) and sector associations (seven members), private&#13;
impact on actual planning remains somewhat limited.               companies from the commercial sector (seven members),&#13;
                                                                  users of the sector (eight members), national and regional&#13;
The fact remains that the communes are not currently in           specialist bodies (three members), and DPs (two members).&#13;
a position to carry out the planning that theoretically falls     It consists of a general assembly, an office, a permanent&#13;
under their remit, either in rural or urban areas. The PLEAs      secretary, and workgroups.&#13;
are a useful measure but it will no doubt be necessary&#13;
to wait several years before these plans are successfully         The CNEA has held only two of its four statutory meetings&#13;
adopted by the communes and their use expanded across             since it was created. On each occasion, it has selected its&#13;
the whole country.                                                own topics for discussion, but the decisions made and&#13;
                                                                  recommendations put forward have not been properly&#13;
There is currently no planning conducted within the               followed up. The CNEA is hampered by the fact that the&#13;
sanitation and hygiene subsector, either in rural or urban        secretaryâ&#128;&#153;s role is carried out by the MEE/LCD (specifically&#13;
areas. The PNAEPA has laid the foundations for a national         by the Directorate of Water Resources [DRE: Direction des&#13;
planning structure, yet this is still to be implemented in        Ressources en Eau)], who does not have the necessary&#13;
the field. The capacity of the new DAB to assume its              resources available to conduct this role successfully.&#13;
role as leader will determine the success of this planning&#13;
approach.                                                         There is also a Consultation Framework in place in Niger&#13;
                                                                  aimed at promoting dialogue between water supply&#13;
Within the UWS subsector, planning has been considerably          and sanitation sector stakeholders. This Consultation&#13;
reinforced by the establishment of SPEN, the asset-holding        Framework, which previously focused mainly on rural&#13;
company responsible for planning, as well as by the work          areas, was expanded to include the UWS subsector at the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Priority actions for financing&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Continue to use the BPO/MTEF tool by improving the way in which this is linked to the financial planning&#13;
          carried out at the commune level.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Assist the UWS subsector to regain financial stability as part of the new financial cycle created as a result of&#13;
          the PSE.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Increase funding efforts over the course of the next few years to finance the RWS subsector, which is still&#13;
          severely underfunded.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Develop financing within the sanitation and hygiene subsector, as both rural and urban areas are currently&#13;
          suffering from severe underinvestment.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Improve the way in which nongovernmental financing is taken into account in the monitoring tools&#13;
          developed within the WSS sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The WSS sector in Niger is highly dependent upon public          Figure 5&#13;
development aid. Not including the operating costs of the        Scorecard indicator scores relating to financing,&#13;
ministries involved, it is estimated that over 90 percent of     compared to peer group8&#13;
funding comes from bilateral and multilateral aid. The main&#13;
                                                                                     RWS&#13;
multilateral external support agencies within the sector&#13;
are the World Bank, the European Union, the African&#13;
Development Bank, and UNICEF; the main bilateral donors&#13;
are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Denmark,&#13;
Germany, Japan, Italy, and Saudi Arabia.&#13;
                                                                 USH                                  UWS&#13;
&#13;
As far as the RWS subsector is concerned, the principle&#13;
means of intervention is still the project, with coordination&#13;
undertaken by MEE/LCD. The situation is rendered complex&#13;
by the number of parts or components dealing with water&#13;
                                                                                      RSH&#13;
supply and sanitation within predominantly agricultural,&#13;
pastoral or rural development projects (for which MEE/              Niger average scores&#13;
LCD does not directly act as contracting authority).                Averages, LICs, GNI p.p. &lt;=$500&#13;
This traditional project-based approach has recently&#13;
started to evolve due to the gradual implementation              Source: CSO2 scorecard.&#13;
of a programmatic approach, whose main tools are&#13;
the BPO and PNAEPA. The initial positive effects of this&#13;
approach are beginning to become apparent insofar as             decentralized cooperation9 (several hundred of these are&#13;
the coordination of interventions has improved, but it has       active in the country). The development of decentralization&#13;
not yet had any real impact on the provision of aid or           has reinforced decentralized cooperation activity, meaning&#13;
financing mechanisms.                                            that communes are emerging as partners at the local&#13;

One of the main characteristics of development aid in            by NGOs emphasize the contracting authority role of&#13;
the WSS sector in Niger is the involvement of NGOs and           communes.10&#13;

The last review of public expenditure (which was restricted                including Niamey). The average investment per new user&#13;
to the RWS subsector) was carried out in 2008 and related                  over this period therefore stands at US$190; this is in line&#13;
only to the 2001â&#128;&#147;07 period. Over this period, an average                   with the costs used in the CSO2 scorecard methodology.&#13;
of US$26 million was spent each year on the construction&#13;
of water supply facilities in rural areas. Around 95 percent               For sanitation and hygiene, the available data is fragmented&#13;
of this amount was mobilized by the GoN, mainly through                    and very imprecise. There are several reasons for this: a&#13;
development aid. The remaining 5 percent came from the                     considerable part of the investment costs is currently being&#13;
users themselves. It is important to note that only one                    mobilized by households themselves; very little investment&#13;
quarter of the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s public expenditure comes from the                  is committed from MEE/LCD or MSP funds; financing&#13;
national budget, and that a large part of this contribution                allocated to sanitation and hygiene is often integrated into&#13;
is allocated to the ministryâ&#128;&#153;s operating costs (mainly for                 larger projects; a large part of the funding is mobilized&#13;
salariesâ&#128;&#148;around US$3 million per year). Approximately 70                   by other ministries or other stakeholders (NGOs, but also&#13;
percent of the national budget is executed each year (the                  UNICEF, which is an important stakeholder within the&#13;
annual budget is always frozen during the final quarter for                subsector); and lastly, there is no M&amp;E mechanism in place&#13;
accounting purposes). It is estimated that NGOs contribute                 to measure either effort or progress made. It is therefore&#13;
10 percent of total sector expenditure on investment.                      very difficult to estimate the level of funding that is&#13;
                                                                           currently being allocated to sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
As far as the UWS subsector is concerned, it is estimated&#13;
that around US$125 million was mobilized between 2002                      Figure 6 shows the investment requirements for each&#13;
and 2009 as part of the Water Sector Project (Projet Sectoriel             subsector, as well as the prospects for financing over the&#13;

funds. This equates to an annual funding stream of around                  been committed to the UWS subsector, the anticipated&#13;
US$15.6 million per year. In total, 600,000 additional people              financing for the other three subsectors is insufficient&#13;
are estimated to have gained access to drinking water in                   to cover requirements. The situation is particularly acute&#13;

With the exception of the UWS subsector, there was, until       Figure 7&#13;
recently, no real national M&amp;E mechanism in place for the       Scorecard indicator scores relating to sector M&amp;E,&#13;
WSS sector in Niger. In the UWS sector there have been          compared to peer group11&#13;
clearly and regularly monitored indicators since 2001, the&#13;

           â&#128;¢	 Continue the Local Water and Sanitation Plan approach with a view to ensuring this becomes the principle&#13;
              tool used for concerted planning at the local level.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Widely distribute the Guide to Water Supply Services within the Rural Water Supply Subsector and supplement&#13;
              this with the targeted training of communes and operators.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Develop a communication strategy for WSS in rural areas.&#13;

at 48 percent. This is higher than the rate estimated by the       Average RWS scorecard scores for enabling,&#13;

of which figures are used, the current rate of development         peer-group comparison&#13;

&#13;
To support this effort, the public authorities need&#13;
to mobilize far higher levels of financing than those&#13;
committed to date (see Figure 9), which are mostly&#13;
based on the average amounts invested over the course&#13;
of the last few years (around US$30 million per year for&#13;

 JMP estimates that in 2008 only 6 percent of households&#13;
 had access to improved sanitation facilities (see Figure 16).             Analysis of the financing available for the RSH subsector&#13;
 This very low rate is due to the fact that the majority of                reveals a considerable funding deficit, making it impossible&#13;
 sanitation facilities found in rural areas do not qualify as              for Niger to meet its sector targets. According to CSO2&#13;
 improved under the JMP definition (they are traditional                   estimates, US$45 million per year will be required to meet&#13;
 latrines). The JMP also estimates that 79 percent of                      the targets, whereas only US$3 million of public investment&#13;
 households practice open defecation. The government-                      has been committed to date (see Figure 17). The potential&#13;
 set target is to achieve an access rate of 50 percent in                  investment from households comes to the same amount&#13;
 2015; this is consistent with the MDG target pertaining                   (US$3 million); added together, these two contributions&#13;
 to access to sanitation in rural areas that was calculated                only cover a very small part of the required investment.&#13;

 There is no national monitoring and evaluation system                    A large part of the progress seen in the subsector is due to&#13;
 for assessing progress made within the urban sanitation                  households investing their own funds in facilities. The state&#13;
 subsector in Niger. The figures estimated by the JMP, based              injects very low levels of public funds into the subsector,&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Niger :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and
            what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in
            over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been
            produced in collaboration with the Government of Niger and
            other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2 analysis
            has three main components: a review of past coverage; a
            costing model to assess the adequacy of future investments;
            and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular
            bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway. The
            CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether past
            trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit,
            specific priority actions have been identified through
            consultation. A synthesis report, available separately,
            presents best practice and shared learning to help realize
            these priority actions.
