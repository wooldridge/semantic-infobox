            Drawing on the Bank's Private
            Participation in Infrastructure Project Database, this Note
            reviews developments in 2003. Data for the year show that
            investment in projects with private participation, totaled
            almost U$S 50 billion - back to 1994 levels. About 100
            projects reached financial closure. Electricity was the only
            sub-sector - and, East Asia, and the Middle East and North
            Africa, the only developing regions - that saw private
            activity grow in 2003.
