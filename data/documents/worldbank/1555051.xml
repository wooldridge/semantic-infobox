ALNUJTRITION: SOME MEASUREMENT AND POLICY ISSUES&#13;
The "energy" and "protein" norms published by the FAO have been&#13;
widely misused for assessing the nutritional status of a population inspite&#13;
of warnings against such use by the FAO itself. The paper points out that&#13;
the process governing variations in daily energy balances in human beings&#13;
is not yet fully understood and a satisfactory theoretical framework for it&#13;
is yet to emerge. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the process is&#13;
stochastic-stationary and auto-regressive and there is a wide variability in&#13;
energy intakes between otherwise similarly situated healthy individuals and&#13;
even in the same individual over time. Many of the widely used procedures&#13;
for assessing nutritional status, by classifying all individuals in a popu-&#13;
lation as malnourished who have intakes below a single average norm for the&#13;
population as a whole, thereby ignoring intra and inter individual variance&#13;
in intakes and requirements, will misclassify individuals (i.e. adequately&#13;
nourished as malnourished and vice-versa) to varying degrees. This mis-&#13;
classification bias need not cancel out for the population as a whole and&#13;
there is a danger in overestimating the proportion of truly malnourished.&#13;
It is important for devising suitable policies for eliminating&#13;
malnutrition where it exists, that the extent of it is not overestimated&#13;
and exaggerated and the malnourished get properly identified as a target&#13;
group. For such overestimatiion will only make the problem appear even more&#13;
intractable than it already is and lead to inaccurate targeting of policies&#13;
resulting in a wasteful use of resources. The process of probing into the&#13;
true extent of malnutrition is likely to reveal that it is largely among&#13;
households who are not only poor but suffer other social disadvantages and&#13;
discrimination, such as the untouchable and tribal households in India, or&#13;
similarly disadvantaged groups in North East Brazil. Further, they often&#13;
have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and edu-&#13;
cational facilities, since they are consigned to urban slums and rural&#13;
ghettos. Attempts to tackle their nutritional problems alone in such a&#13;
context are almost futile. Integrating them more fully into the economy&#13;
by providing them adequate and secure income earning opportunities, while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
at the same time making a determined effort at reducing their formidable&#13;
social disadvantages will go further in tackling their poverty and nutritional&#13;
problems than nutrition interventions per se. While the interaction between&#13;
nutritional deficiency and the health status of an individual runs both ways,&#13;
the policies that reduce morbidity such as provision of safe drinking water,&#13;
sanitation facilities and a generally healthy environment may be the appro-&#13;
priate way to break into this reaction chain, with policies for nutrition&#13;
intervention following if needed.&#13;

MALNUTRITION: SOME MEASUREMENT AND POLICY ISSUES *&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
One of the widely used indirect methods of estimating the extent&#13;
of malnutrition (i.e., the nutritional status) of a population is to estimate&#13;
it as that proportion of the population with energy intakes below some norms&#13;
called "requirements." These norms, for a reference man and for a reference&#13;
woman were published by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and&#13;
evaluated periodically by their expert groups. See FAO (1950, 1957, 1973,&#13;
1974, 1975, 1978a, 1978b). Based on the "requirements" of a reference man&#13;
or woman, those for other age-sex groups were also made available.&#13;
The publications of FAO were very careful to point out that the&#13;
"requirements" cannot be used for examining the nutritional status of a&#13;
population. For instance, FAO (1974) states, "The figures for recommended&#13;
intakes may be compared with actual consumption figures determined by food-&#13;
consumption surveys. Such comparisons, though always useful, cannot in&#13;
themselves justify statements that undernutrition, maZnutrition or over-&#13;
nutrition is present in a community or group, as such concZusions must&#13;
always be supported by clinicaZ or bio-chemical evidence. The recommended&#13;

and two hours in walking, active recreation, etc.&#13;
* This paper owes its inspiration to a seminar addressed in 1978 by&#13;
Professor P.V. Sukhatme at the Development Research Center of the World&#13;
Bank. Indeed many of the ideas discussed here are his and my debt to&#13;
his writings is gratefully acknowledged. I am grateful to Professor&#13;
Sukhatme, V.V. Bhatt, Robert Cassen, Dean Jamison, Philip Payne,&#13;

intakes are not an adequate yardstick for assessing health because ... each&#13;
figure represents an average requirement augmented by a factor that takes&#13;
into account inter-individual variability." (p. 2, emphasis added).2/&#13;
Inspite of such unequivocal statements, even the FAO, in its Fourth&#13;
World Food Survey (1977), has not refrained from using average energy&#13;
requirements as the basis for estimating the proportion of malnourished in&#13;
a number of countries!&#13;
There is a further widespread use of the average energy requirement&#13;
of a population in determining an absolute poverty line through the income-&#13;
calorie intake relationship. This is apparently based on an almost naive&#13;
belief that the arbitrariness involved in defining a poverty level of&#13;
income can be escaped by linking it to an 'objective' standard such as energy&#13;
requirement. Thus the poor are defined as those who cannot afford to buy&#13;
their energy requirements. The early studies on India, by P.D. Ojha (1970),&#13;
Dandekar and Rath (1971) and a much later global study of Reutlinger and&#13;
Selowsky (1976), are of this type. There have been studies, which go beyond&#13;
estimating the proprotion of calorie-deficient in a population at a time and&#13;
estimate, the calorie-gap in terms of food grains, that needs to be met if&#13;
malnutrition is to be eliminated. Further, alternative policy (national&#13;
and international) interventions for eliminating malnutrition (and poverty)&#13;
are often compared in terms of their cost effectiveness, administrative&#13;
feasibility and their implications for international capital transfers.-/&#13;
2/ FAO also points out that the methodological basis for estimating energy&#13;
requirements is weak and much of the information on protein requirements&#13;
and energy-protein relationships come from studies on healthy young men&#13;
in the USA, thereby making them of questionable applicability elsewhere.&#13;

It would appear that the analytical and empirical foundations for&#13;
the use of calorie norm in examining problems of the nutritional status or of&#13;
absolute poverty are dubious. The purposes of this paper are: firstly, to&#13;
describe a theoretical model of energy balance and its statistical properties&#13;
(Section 2); secondly, in the light of the proposed model, to examine critically&#13;
some of the widely used procedures in estimating malnutrition and their data&#13;
base (Sections 3and 4) drawing upon household survey data from India and&#13;
Sri Lanka and finally, in Section 5, to offer a few concluding observations&#13;
on the implications for policy and further research.&#13;
2. THE MEANING OF CALORIE REQUIREMENT AND MALNOURISHMENT: A CONCEPTUAL&#13;
FRAMEWORK&#13;
The basic concept that is at the root of the calorie requirement&#13;
calculation is that of energy balance. A human body, much like any energy&#13;
conversion device, converts the energy content of food (measured in calories)&#13;
into other forms of energy of which, a part is used up in maintaining bodily&#13;
functions (including, in particular, the maintenance of body temperature), a&#13;
part is converted into changes in body weight, a part is used up in physical&#13;
activity including work and the remaining part is 'wasted' particularly&#13;
in the energy content of bodily wastes. Of course by law of conservation of&#13;
energy, the energy input has to equal energy output. Just as there are&#13;
differences among different machines in their efficiency (i.e., the ratio of&#13;
output of usable energy to energy input), different human beings differ in&#13;
their functions as energy converters. However, the human body apparently has an&#13;
essential homeostatic or regulatory mechanism which adjusts to varying intakes&#13;
of food, without drawing on (losing weight) reserves or adding to reserves&#13;
(gaining weight), while at the same time enabling the individual to perform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
tasks involving a given level of energy expenditure. Of course, like all&#13;
regulatory mechanisms, this one also can accommodate only a certain amount of&#13;
variability in daily intakes: too low (high) an intake sustained over a period,&#13;
can be accommodated by drawing on (adding to) reserves in terms of body weight&#13;
and/or changes in the level of activity. In more extreme cases, the individual&#13;
becomes malnourished so that many of his functions are impaired (and in severe&#13;
cases he dies) or he suffers from the illnesses arising out of obesity. Thus&#13;
we can distinguish two mechanisms operating: a regulatory mechanism which&#13;
takes care of moderate variations in intakes with no change in weight or&#13;
activity and an adaptation mechanism that adjusts to sustained levels of&#13;
too low or too high intakes through changes in bodily function and activity.&#13;
Payne and Dugdale suggest that the adaptive mechanism operates over&#13;
a much longer time frame (months and years): a prolonged over (under) feeding&#13;
in the sense of energy intakes exceeding (falling short of) maintenance energy&#13;
needs would result in an increase (decrease) of body weight, the extent of which&#13;
depends on body composition, i.e., whether an individual is metabolically&#13;
fat, average or lean. While modification of physical activity is a major&#13;
element in adaptation to changes in energy intake, it is not easy to distinguish&#13;
between cause and effect, that is between intake being low because of light&#13;
activity and activity being light because of low intake.A/&#13;
There are two alternative points of view as to how the regulatory&#13;
mechanism operates. In the Payne and Dugdale (1977) model, positive (negative)&#13;
daily energy balances, will lead over a period of time, to an increase (decrease)&#13;
4/ Payne and Dugdale (1977a) state that inspite of a large amount of&#13;
experimental work there is as yet no adequate theoretical framework to&#13;
suggest critical experiments to test alternative hypotheses about these&#13;
processes. Professor Payne pointed out in correspondence that it is&#13;
not known how far adaptation can take place without an important loss of&#13;
body function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in body weight resulting in an increase (decrease) in Basic Metabolic Rate&#13;
(BMR) and hence a greater (lower) maintenance energy cost, thus reducing&#13;
(increasing) the energy balance, eventually turning it negative (positive)&#13;
thereby reducing (increasing) body weight (Payne and Dugdale (1977a)).&#13;
This model permits a range of genetic variability among individuals (even&#13;
of the same age, sex, body weight, etc.)through variations in the ratio of&#13;
energy stored as protein to total energy stored. In the model of Sukhatme&#13;
and Margen (1978), the relationship is a stationary stochastic process. In&#13;
this model, the daily energy balance in a healthy individual maintaining&#13;
body weight is a first order Markov process. It would appear that a fixed&#13;
non-stochastic relationship between BMR and body weight implies that the&#13;
energy requirement of individuals of the same age, sex and body weight would&#13;
be identical. But this is contrary to the empirical studies of Widdowson&#13;
(1962) that showed that on an average, the intakes of two out of forty such&#13;
individuals differ by as much as a factor of two and this difference is reduced&#13;
but not eliminated, if an allowance is made for differences in body weight.&#13;
A stochastic relationship between BMR and body weight is consistent with these&#13;
observations.&#13;
Some implications of a stochastic model of energy balance can be&#13;
derived as follows.  Consider the daily energy intake   Xt  of a healthy&#13;
individual performing essentially the same activity while maintaining his&#13;
body weight.  We can view   Xt  as a random variable with mean  m . The&#13;
discrepancy  Xt - m Et , under our assumptions that individual maintains&#13;
(i.e., there is no time trend) his body weight and activity level, has the&#13;
same distribution and behaves in the same fashion as his daily energy balance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
We can assume that   wt   of the scoe individual over successive days (denoted&#13;
by t) is a first order autoregressive process:&#13;
(1)                           wt =   t-l    t&#13;
where u 's are independently normally distributed with mean zero and&#13;
variance   a  . This implies that:&#13;
2   22&#13;
(2)                   Ett = 0   and  Ew 2         a 2&#13;
where  E   is the expectation operator.    The variance  a2    is the intra-&#13;
individual variance in intakes. The variance of an estimate of m based&#13;
on the average of intakes of any T consecutive periods is given by:&#13;
T  2&#13;
(3)   E(TT)           T   (l   )a (lp                                 where&#13;
1 + p     2p(1 - pT)&#13;
1 - P   T(l_ p)2&#13;
It is clear from (3) that the dampening effect on the variance of the mean as&#13;
T  increases is considerably reduced, the larger the absolute value of       p&#13;
Of course, if p = 0 we get the usual result that the variance of the mean&#13;
2&#13;
of  T  observations is   a&#13;
It is natural to define   m = E(X )   in a healthy individual who&#13;
maintains his body weight as his 'true' energy or calorie requirement, given his&#13;
activity. In other words, the 'true' calorie requirement of an individual&#13;
is his mean calorie intake while remaining in health, at the same body weight&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and performing the same task or different tasks requiring the same energy.&#13;
By the same token, we can say that an individual is malnourished, if the&#13;
mean of his actuaZ intake is below the hypothetical mean intake m that&#13;
would have enabled him to perform his assigned task while maintaining health&#13;
and activity. If the mean m for a specific individual is known, and if data&#13;
(in principle, if not necessarily in practice) relating to his actual intakes&#13;
Xt over some period of time T are available, then the question of&#13;
determining whether he is malnourished or not becomes one of testing whether&#13;
his mean intake equals m on the basis of a sample of size T .&#13;
Viewing the problem of determination of the nutritional status of&#13;
an individual from his mean intakes as a problem of testing of hypothesis&#13;
alerts us to the fact that classification errors will arise. The probability&#13;
of the two types of error (i.e., of misclassifying a weii-nourished individual&#13;
as malnourished and vice-versa) depend both on the procedure of classification&#13;
and on the inherent intra-individual variability in intakes. For instance,&#13;
if we know m and adopt the procedure of classifying an individual as&#13;
malnourished if his mean intake during the observed period T is less than&#13;
m , then assuming normality of the relevant distribution, the probability of&#13;
/m -m&#13;
the individual being classified as malnourished is          0 o  where   ,&#13;
w&#13;
(here and in the rest of the paper) is the cumulative probability function&#13;
of unit normal deviate and  m   is the individual's 'true' mean intake.-   This&#13;
5/ We are assuming that the stochastic process characterising the deviations&#13;
of actual intakes from its mean mo is the same as that characterising&#13;
the deviations of intakes (actual in the case of a healthy individual&#13;
and hypothetical in the case of malnourished) around the requirement   m&#13;
However, in the case of malnourished since both regulatory and adaptation&#13;
mechanisms may be operating, this assumption is not, strictly speaking, valid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
means that this procedure will classify any individual as malnourished with&#13;
a positive probability.  If in fact   m0 = m , i.e., the individual has no&#13;
deficiency, there is a 0.5 probability of his being classified as malnourishedl&#13;
We can extend this model to a population of individuals following&#13;
Sukhatme (1978).  Denote by  X     the energy intake of the ith individual on&#13;
it&#13;
the t   day.  We can write&#13;
(4)                        xi= 1 + bi + wit&#13;
where  p  could be interpreted as the 'true' energy requirement of the referAnce&#13;
individual,  bi  the deviation of the 'true' requirement of individual   i  from&#13;
that of the reference individual and   wit  is a random daily fluctuation of&#13;
actual intake of individual   i  around his requirement  p + bi . Assuming&#13;
that the same first order autoregressive process characterises the behaviour&#13;
of all healthy individuals we can write&#13;
(5)                        =it   Pwit-l +uit&#13;
where uit's are independently (over days and across individuals) and&#13;
2&#13;
normally distributed with mean zero and variance   a  . Let us further assume&#13;
that the distribution of individual specific   bi's  in the population is&#13;
normal with mean zero and variance   ab2  and that  b 's  and  wit's  are&#13;
independent.  While the assumption of normality is not necessarily vrlid.it&#13;
enables us to make several points sharply.&#13;
First, if we consider a population of healthy individuals, 95%&#13;
of such individuals will have intakes within the interval p ± 1.96 a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

where   a 2    2 + °b    . Sukhatme (1970) estimates that not only that&#13;
2                                                                   2&#13;
a   # 0  but indeed it accounts for more than three quarters of      a&#13;
Some interesting estimation problems arise in using this model.&#13;
Suppose we have data X,t on intakes for T days of a sample N individuals&#13;
from a healthy population. Then, it is easy to show that the maximum&#13;
likelihood (ignoring autocorrelation of    wit) estimates of    p, b1 (i = 1, ... N)&#13;
and  a 2   and  a 2  are:&#13;
b     &#13;
(6)                p           =      X     xit&#13;
t7)           bi =     ab      (X  -X)   where  X-       Xit&#13;
ab  +a                            1&#13;
2  2    1 '            2)&#13;
(8)                            ab  =NL I    .i&#13;
(9)                     a   = N      (Xit  bi 1)&#13;
From (6) and (7), it would appear that as long as     a 2. 0    the  ML  estimate&#13;
of the 'true' requirement    p + bi  of an individual   i  is not his mean intake&#13;
Xi  but a weighted average of    Xi  and overall mean   X , the weights&#13;
respectively being the shares of intra-individual and-inter-individual variances&#13;
2&#13;
in total intake variance    a  . This has the further consequence that the&#13;
estimate of the difference in the true requirements of two healthy individuals&#13;
i  and  j   is not the difference in their mean intakes    X    and  X   but&#13;
2&#13;
+ ^2 (Xi - X)     so that      - X;  overstates the difference in true&#13;
requirements as long as   a 2    0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
The fact that there are intra-individual (a   ) and inter-individual&#13;
(ab ) variances in intakes is important in estimating the proportion of mal-&#13;
nourished. The consequences of ignoring them altogether, as some of the&#13;
currently practised procedures come close to doing so, can be illustrated by&#13;
an example: suppose requirements, in fact, vary among individuals but intakes&#13;
do not. If the intake of each individual (which is also the average intake&#13;
for the population) is less than the average requirement of the population,&#13;
we will be classifying the entire population as malnourished while in fact&#13;
a part of it will be. If the intake exceeded the average requirement we&#13;
will be asserting that no member of the population is malnourished while in&#13;
fact some are./ Further the estimates based on this procedure (or its&#13;
variants) are highly sensitive to the level of requirement.&#13;
3. METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF A WIDELY USED PROCEDURE OF ESTIMATION OF&#13;
THE EXTENT OF MALNUTRITION&#13;
Let us waive, for the purposes of present discussion, the conceptual&#13;
problems of using calorie requirement, however defined, as a norm of comparison&#13;
with intakes to determine the nutritional status and examine some of the&#13;
procedures of estimation of the extent of malnutrition. Perhaps the most&#13;
widely used procedure in estimating the extent of malnutrition is some variant&#13;
of the one used by Ojha (1970) and Dandekar and Rath (1971) in India and later,&#13;
independently by Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976). There is a fundamental&#13;
6/ As Sukhatme (1977, p. 7) points out, "If the dividing line between the&#13;
undernourished and overnourished is the average requirement, then one&#13;
aannot but conclude that the more serious problem for Brazil is&#13;
overnutrition than undernutrition! One is bound to reach such an absurd&#13;
conclusion if one does not allow for intra-individual variation in&#13;
estimating the incidence of undernutrition."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
unity of approach in these studies in spite of their difference in scope,&#13;
the data base and the treatment of income-calorie intake relationship. As&#13;
such we discuss only the approach of Reutlinger and Selowsky (R-S). They&#13;
postulate a linear relation between the calorie intake, i , (of presumably&#13;
an individual) and Y , the logarithm of his income, so that i = a + bY .&#13;
Given the parameters of this relationship, one can solve for the income Yc&#13;
needed to ensure a given calorie consumption c by the antilogarithm of&#13;
Yc = (c - a)/b . If we now bring in the data on distribution of individuals&#13;
in the population according to their income, denoted by the cumulative dis-&#13;
tribution function F( ) , then the proportion of individuals consuming c&#13;
calories or below is clearly F(Y ) . By setting c equal to the average&#13;
calorie requirement, they get their estimates of the proportion of malnourished.&#13;
They vary c around the requirement and find that the estimates are quite&#13;
sensitive to the choice of c . It should be observed, and this is a crucial&#13;
point, regardless of how the average c is computed, the basis of classification&#13;
is the comparison of average calorie intake (estimated or actual) of individuals&#13;
in an income class with a single number c , thus in effect ignoring intra and&#13;
inter individual variations discussed above. All individuals within an income&#13;
class are classified as malnourished, if the average calorie intake of the&#13;
class is below c . R-S (1977) in their response to a comment of Payne (1977)&#13;
argue that even though any given individual may be misclassified by this&#13;
procedure, for the population as a whole the estimates will be unbiased if&#13;
either the deviation of each individual's intake from the mean intake of his&#13;
income class is the same as the deviation of his requirement from the mean&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

requirement (assumed the same for all groups) or if the number of individuals&#13;
misclassified as malnourished in the income classes that are classified as&#13;
malnourished as a whoZe cZass equals the number of individuals who are mis-&#13;
classified as adequately nourished in those income classes which are classified&#13;
as adequately nourished as a whoZe cZass. They further claim that even if&#13;
these conditions are not satisfied, the bias is unlikely to exceed 10%.&#13;
Several comments are in order. Firstly, neither condition is&#13;
verifiable with their grouped data. Secondly, the first condition (or its&#13;
variant that the ratio of an individual's intake to his requirement is the&#13;
same as that of the respective means for his income class) simply ensures&#13;
that if the income class is getting less calories on an average than its&#13;
requirement then every member of the class is suffering from the same&#13;
deficiency. A case can be made for such a condition being satisfied, within&#13;
a household in the unlikely event that intra-household allocations are so&#13;
equitable that each member is allocated calories from the household supply&#13;
in proportion to his or her requirement. But it is highly unlikely that&#13;
the variations of intakes and requirements of a member of an income class from&#13;
the respective class averages satisfy this condition. Thirdly, the second&#13;
condition is highly unlikely to be satisfied for the following reasons:&#13;
at the upper reaches of the income scale requirements are likely to be fully&#13;
met so that there is very little malnutrition and at the lower end the&#13;
average requirements themselves are likely to be below the average for the&#13;
population as a whole to the extent lower (per capita) income households have&#13;
a larger proportion of children and older dependents. In addition there&#13;
is likely to be less wastage of food in poorer households. Finally, even in&#13;

the event of the R-S method yielding an unbiased estimate of the extent of&#13;
malnutrition it will almost surely err on its incidence in the population&#13;
since it locates all of it in the group who have incomes below the cut-off&#13;
point. Clearly from a policy point of view errors in this way of identifying&#13;
the target groups is of some consequence.&#13;
It is possible to assess the extent of some of the biases discussed&#13;
above on the basis of household survey data. Pravin Visaria (1979) examined the&#13;
consequences of applying the R-S procedure with household survey data from&#13;
Sri Lanka for 1969-70. The data included information on the age-sex&#13;
composition of each household, its total calorie intake from food consumption&#13;
and its total consumption expenditure. These were tabulated for Sri Lanka&#13;
as a whole as well as for Rural, Urban, Estate (i.e., tea plantations) sector&#13;
separately. The calorie norms used were 2,220 Kcal. per capita (FAQ) and&#13;
2,750 Kcal. per adult equivalent. When using the latter norm, the number&#13;
of individuals of each age-sex group in a household was converted to the&#13;
number of equivalent weights by using the weights published by the Indian&#13;
National Sample Survey. In determining the level of household expenditure&#13;
at which caloric norm was met, he used a regression relationship between&#13;
caloric intake per equivalent adult of a household and its per capita&#13;
consumption expenditure. Thus the poverty line was defined as that per capita&#13;
expenditure at which estimated adult equivalent caloric intake was 2,750 Kcal.&#13;
From our point of view the following results based on Visaria (1979) are of&#13;
interest.&#13;
(1) Age-sex composition does matter: that is, whether one uses a&#13;
per capita or per adult equivalent caloric norm makes a difference as shown&#13;
below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

51.9        48.1      99.9&#13;
Thus, even though the proportion of Sri Lanka's population classified by&#13;
either criterion as malnourished is almost the same, households accounting&#13;
for 9.3% of the population gets misclassified.&#13;
(2) The comparison of the results from classifying the members of&#13;
aZZ households with per capita expenditure below the poverty line as mal-&#13;
nourished (i.e., by the R-S procedure) with classifying each household by&#13;
comparing its adult equivalent calorie intake with the norm of 2750 Kcal.&#13;
is as follows:&#13;

There is a maximum downword bias in using the R-S procedure of the&#13;
order of 10.4%.   However the percentage of population living in misclassified&#13;
households varies from as high as 20.6 in the estate sector to an even higher&#13;
27.2 for all island.&#13;
Indian data from National Sample Survey Organisation (1976) reveal&#13;
a similar picture. The calorie norm used was 2700 Kcals. per consumer unit&#13;
(adult equivalent). While in Rural India the R-S procedure has a downward&#13;
bias as in every sector of Sri Lanka, in Urban India it has an upward bias.&#13;

(3) Perhaps the most interesting result of Visaria's analysis&#13;
throws into considerable doubt the use of caloric norm as a criterion for&#13;
determining nutritional status, thereby supporting the conceptual criticism&#13;
of the first section of this paper. He classifies households according&#13;
to the extent of departure of their adult equivalent caloric intake from&#13;
the norm and the decile of per capita consumption expenditure to which the&#13;
household belongs. We reproduce here the results for the whole of Sri&#13;
Lanka only.&#13;

It is seen that in Sri Lanka as high as 34.0% of the population in the&#13;
top quintiles have calorie intakes exceeding requirements by more than 40%!&#13;
Similarly, 12.9% of the population in the bottom quintile have calorie&#13;
intakes falling short of requirements by more than 40%. In India, in the&#13;
top third of the population as high as 57.6% in rural areas and 28.9% in&#13;
urban areas have intakes exceeding requirements by more than 30%. In the&#13;
bottom third, 39.3% in rural and 47.2% in urban areas have intakes falling&#13;
short of requirements by more than 30%. If the energy requirements mean&#13;
anything at all, departures from these norms to this extent and in this large&#13;
a proportion of households should mean visible ill-health for these people.&#13;
There is no independent evidence for such a state of affairs. This brings&#13;
out sharply the inadequacy of using average calorie requirement as determinants&#13;
of nutritional status. Besides it may also reflect some inherent problems&#13;
in the use of survey data on consumption to which we now turn.&#13;
4. THE DATA BASE OF MALNUTRITION STUDIES&#13;
A few brief remarks on the data base of many of the malnutrition&#13;
studies are in order. The data base of most studies is a household estimates&#13;
of average annual consumption (per capita or per household), often at a national&#13;
and sometimes at the regional levels within a country. Given that income dis-&#13;
tribution is likely to be highly skewed, the absolute number of high income&#13;
households in the sample will be far fewer than lower income ones even with a&#13;
large sample size, so that the estimate of any characteristic is likely to be&#13;
subject to greater sompZing error for the upper income groups.   Besides even&#13;
the inherent variation of the characteristic itself may be higher for upper&#13;
income groups though this is likely to be less of a problem for necessities,&#13;
like food. Some of the better designed surveys, such as the National Sample&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Survey in India canvass independent sub-samples of households during different&#13;
sub-rounds spread throughout the year so that even if the data relating to&#13;
households covered in any sub-round are affected by seasonality (if the reference&#13;
period was part or whole of the sub-round), the estimate averaged over-all house-&#13;
holds taken in all the sub-rounds is free of seasonality. However, any analysis&#13;
that is based on individual household data will be affected by seasonality.&#13;
On the other hand, if the reference period is the whole previous year, the&#13;
seasonal effect disappears but recall biases enter. In countries such as&#13;
India and Pakistan, a large proportion of rural households grow their own&#13;
food, exchange food in kind, etc. and for some of these food items there is&#13;
hardly any market. Even though the investigators are instructed to record&#13;
consumption out of home-grown stock as well as out of gifts and exchanges in&#13;
kind, it is widely held that not all of this get recorded. Since many of the&#13;
poorer peasant households engage in these activities to a greater extent than&#13;
others, it is likely that a downward bias exists in their recorded food (and&#13;
hence calorie) intakes. At the other end, the food served by richer peasants&#13;
to their farm workers and guests often get recorded as their consumption so&#13;
that fantastically high calorie intakes (as high as 5000 Kcals. per consumer&#13;
unit per day) are observed.&#13;
There is another source of bias--even if the food item consumed by&#13;
a rich and poor household is called by the same name, the quality and price&#13;
per unit are often different. If the calorie intake is inferred from food&#13;
expenditures, the bias is obvious. Even if consumption data in physical units&#13;
are recorded, the quality differences affect calorie (and more often the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
protein) content-for instance, the rich consume more processed and&#13;
possibly less nutritious foods than the poor. To the extent the various&#13;
biases tend to result in making the calorie intake-income relationship&#13;
steeper than it really is, removing such biases would make the estimate&#13;
of the extent of malnutrition obtained by applying the R-S procedure even&#13;
more sensitive to the variations in the average calorie requirement than&#13;
the already high sensitivity recorded by them.&#13;
5. SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH&#13;
To summarize the discussion so far:  The "energy" and "protein"&#13;
norms published by the FAO have been widely misused for assessing the&#13;
nutritional status of a population inspite of warnings against such use&#13;
by the FAO itself. It was argued that the process governing variations in&#13;
daily energy balances in human beings is not yet fully understood and a&#13;
satisfactory theoretical framework for it is yet to emerge. Nevertheless,&#13;
there is some evidence that the process is stochastic-stationary and auto-&#13;
regressive and there is a wide variability in energy intakes between otherwise&#13;
similarly situated healthy individuals and even in the same individual over&#13;
time. Many of the widely used procedures for assessing nutritional status,&#13;
by classifying all individuals in a population as malnourished who have&#13;
intakes below a single average norm for the population as a whole, thereby&#13;
ignoring intra and inter individual variance in intakes and requirements,&#13;
will misclassify individuals (i.e. adequately nourished as malnourished and&#13;
vice-versa) to varying degrees. This misclassification bias need not cancel&#13;
out for the population as a whole and there is a danger in overestimating the&#13;
proportion of truly malnourished.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 24 -&#13;
It is important for devising suitable policies for eliminating&#13;
malnutrition where it exists, that the extent of it is not overestimated&#13;
and exaggerated and the malnourished get properly identified as a target&#13;
group. For such overestimation will only make the problem appear even more&#13;
intractable than it already is. And inaccurate targeting will result in&#13;
a waste of scarce resources. The process of probing into the true extent&#13;
of malnutrition is likely to reveal that it is largely among households&#13;
who are not only poor but suffer other social disadvantages and dis-&#13;
crimination, such as the untouchable and tribal households in India, or&#13;
similarly disadvantaged groups in North East Brazil. Further, they often&#13;
have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health and&#13;
educational facilities, since they are consigned to urban slums and rural&#13;
ghettos. Attempts to tackle their nutritional problems alone in such a&#13;
context are almost futile. Many such programs have failed in the past.&#13;
Given their extreme poverty and their tenuous link with the rest of the&#13;
economy through inadequate and uncertain employment opportunities, it is&#13;
not surprising that any shortfall in aggregate food supply finds them priced&#13;
out of the market. Integrating them more fully into the economy by providing&#13;
them adequate and secure income earning opportunities, while at the same&#13;
time making a determined effort at reducing their formidable social dis-&#13;
advantages will go further in tackling their poverty and nutritional problems&#13;
than nutrition interventions per se. Given the known inequalities in the&#13;
intra-family allocation of food in poor families, calorie availability has&#13;
to be greater than each family's requirement so as to ensure that every member&#13;
gets his due share. An implication of this argument is that an individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
can consume more than his requirements indefinitely without adjusting his&#13;
bodily functions and activity. The above discussion on the regulatory&#13;
mechanism governing energy balance shows this to be fallacious. Similarly&#13;
by constuning more than one's requirement in good years, one could not avoid&#13;
malnutrition in bad years, though maintaining health and nutritional status&#13;
would undoubtedly improve one's capacity to sustain mild deprivation.&#13;
According to Payne and Dugdale (1977b), in subsistence agricultural&#13;
societies the pattern of eating is often of feasts in good times and fasts&#13;
in bad times, so that the ability to store excess energy efficiently and&#13;
release it when needed has survival values. As such individuals' with such&#13;
genetic capability have an advantage. But it is bizarre to go from this to&#13;
argue that in modern times, fluctuations in food availability should be&#13;
evened out by inducing people to eat excessively and put on body weight&#13;
during good years and lose it during bad years! Even the least efficient&#13;
developing country should be able to design and manage a better buffer stock&#13;
arrangementl&#13;
While the interaction between nutritional deficiency and the health&#13;
status of an individual runs both ways, the policies that reduce morbidity&#13;
such as provision of safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and a gen-&#13;
erally healthy environment may be the appropriate way to break into this&#13;
reaction chain, with policies for nutrition intervention per se following&#13;
if needed. And since severe malnutrition is predominantly a symptom of&#13;
extreme poverty, the importance of policies that augment the income earning&#13;
opportunities (and their growth over time) of the poor and socially dis-&#13;
advantaged can hardly be overemphasized.&#13;

            Malnutrition : some measurement and policy issues
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The energy and protein norms published
            by the FAO have been widely misused for assessing the
            nutritional status of a population in spite of warnings
            against such use by the FAO itself. The paper points out
            that the process governing variations in daily energy
            balances in human beings is not yet fully understood and a
            satisfactory theoretical framework for it has yet to emerge.
            Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the process is
            stochastic-stationary and auto-regressive, and there is a
            wide variability in energy intakes between otherwise
            similarly situated healthy individuals and even in the same
            individual over time. Many of the widely used procedures for
            assessing nutritional status, by classifying all individuals
            in a population as malnourished who have intakes below a
            single average norm for the population as a whole, thereby
            ignoring intra and inter individual variance in intakes and
            requirements, will misclassify individuals to varying
            degrees. This misclassification bias need not cancel out for
            the population as a whole and there is a danger in
            overestimating the proportion of truly malnourished.
