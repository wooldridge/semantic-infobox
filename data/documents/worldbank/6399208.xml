            Investment flows to infrastructure
            projects with private participation in developing countries
            grew by 12 percent to US$64 billion in 2004.
            Telecommunications investments drove the growth, rising by
            35 percent, while investment flows to other infrastructure
            sectors fell by 20 percent. Greenfield projects were the
            most common type of private participation, and management
            contracts became more frequent.
