PILOT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                   Republic of Mali&#13;
Implementing Agency:       Agence pour la Promotion des Filieres Agricoles (APROFA)&#13;
Beneficiaries:              The Ministry of Rural Development and Environment, agricultural trading&#13;
and processing professional associations and entrepreneurs, Regional&#13;
Chambers of Agriculture&#13;
Poverty Category:           Not applicable&#13;
Credit Amount:              SDR 3.9 million (US$6.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                      Standard, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Commitment Fee:             0.5 percent on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver&#13;
On lending Terms:           Proceeds of the Credit would be transferred in grant form to APROFA&#13;
Financing Plan:             See Para. 4.30&#13;
Net Present Value:         Not applicable&#13;
Project Description:       This five-year pilot project would address key sectoral constraints to&#13;
private investment in agricultural processing and marketing, and would&#13;
focus primarily on capacity-building and on the transfer of know-how to&#13;
the private sector through information networks, training, specialized&#13;
technical assistance, and study tours. The project would pursue a two-&#13;
pronged approach: (a) provision of generic support in three regions to all&#13;
profitable  agroprocessing  private  entrepreneurs,  upstream   and&#13;
downstream of agricultural production, and (b) transfer of specialized&#13;
expertise to enterprises operating in subsectors or product lines with a&#13;
high potential for intemational export which require high-quality&#13;
standards, such as fresh and dried fruits and vegetables, hides and skins,&#13;
and shea nuts and other exotic products. Project management would be&#13;
entrusted to an "Agricultural Trading and Processing Promotion Agency"&#13;
a non-profit organization, to be created by the Permanent Assembly of&#13;
Malian Chambers of Agriculture, who will delegate to it full authority for&#13;
the implementation of this project and would ensure its full autonomy in&#13;
managing it. The Government will exercise overall project supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v -&#13;
through the Ministry of Rural Development and Environment. The&#13;
Agency will have streamlined operating structures, comprising a&#13;
zoordinating unit located in Bamako, and, in full operation, three regional&#13;
support units. The project will provide funding for: (i) the operation of&#13;
the Agency's three regional branches in the Sikasso, Segou, and Mopti&#13;
regions; (ii) support packages, including specialized technical assistance,&#13;
training, studies and investment funds for three professional organizations&#13;
promoting vertical integration for the fruit/vegetable, hides/skins, and&#13;
oilseeds/sheanut  subsectors;  (iii)  the  Agency's  operations  and&#13;
management, and the establishment and operation of an agricultural&#13;
processing and marketing information exchange network; and (iv)&#13;
activities aimed at facilitating entrepreneurs' access to investment&#13;
financing and credit.&#13;
Project Implementation:      During the first two years, only two regional agency branches (Sikasso&#13;
and Segou, which have obvious potential for agroprocessing) and one&#13;
support package to a professional organization (AMELEF, for the fruit&#13;
and vegetable subsector), will be launched. A mid-term review will assess&#13;
the impact and performance of the first phase and make recommendations&#13;
to improve project design and implementation. It will also address the&#13;
question of whether to expand project support to one or more regional&#13;
agency branch (Mopti) and to two more subsectoral professional&#13;
organizations.&#13;
Benefits:                   The main project benefits would be higher growth rates in the agricultural&#13;
trading and agroprocessing sector, thus contributing to greater econonic&#13;
diversification and increased urban and rural employment. This would be&#13;
achieved by the project laying the groundwork for a strong supply&#13;
response to the CFAF devaluation through the provision of: (a) increased&#13;
access opportunities to local and regional markets; (b) increased exports,&#13;
especially those of high value products; and (c) improved capabilities of&#13;
the Regional Chambers of Agriculture and of subsectoral professional&#13;
organizations to provide demand-driven support services to private&#13;
entrepreneurs. The project would also reduce the incidence of poverty and&#13;
enhance women's participation in and benefits from development, as most&#13;
of the project's potential beneficiaries would be small entrepreneurs, many&#13;
of them women, already involved in agricultural processing.&#13;
Risks:                      The project's main risks are: (a) its reliance upon Chambers of&#13;
Agriculture and professional organizations which are still weak and&#13;
inexperienced; (b) poor management and misuse by the Agency of its&#13;
autonomy in project implementation; and (c) the abandonment by&#13;
Government of its present policy of support to the private sector. These&#13;
risks constitute another set of reasons for the pilot format of this project.&#13;
Precautions taken to minimize these risks include provisions for: (a) high&#13;
selectivity in choosing organizations participating in implementation; (b)&#13;
stringent management rules and procedures, especially with regard to sub-&#13;
contracting procedures, similar to those already used successfully in the&#13;
"AGETIPE" projects in the region; and (c) strong monitoring of&#13;
&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
AGRICULTURAL TRADING AND PROCESSING PROMOTION&#13;
PILOT PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.01        With a per capita GNP of only US$3 10 in 1992, Mali is one of the world's poorest&#13;
countries. Per capita incomes declined between 1980 and 1991, as the 2.5 percent annual growth&#13;
of real GDP lagged behind the 3.2% rate of population growth. Literacy (32%), life expectancy&#13;
(45 years at birth), and access to health services are also among the lowest in the world. Mali's&#13;
population, currently estimated at nine million, is mostly young and rural. Half of the population&#13;
is under twenty years of age, and three fourths of them live in rural areas. Repeated droughts&#13;
have increased migratory flows to urban centers, where the population is now growing at nearly 5&#13;
percent a year.&#13;
1.02        The rural sector dominates the Malian economy, accounting for 50 percent of&#13;
GDP, occupying more than 80 percent of the active population, and providing 75 percent of&#13;
export earnings. Of the country's 1.2 million square kilometers, only about one third is usable,&#13;
with 24 percent taken up by pasture, 7 percent by forests, and only 2 percent by cultivation. Rain&#13;
fed agriculture predominates, accounting for 90 percent of the 2.5 million hectares planted&#13;
annually. The main crops, millet, sorghum and maize, are grown largely for home consumption.&#13;
Other rain fed cash crops include cotton and groundnuts, cotton providing up to 45 percent of&#13;
export revenues. Irrigated crops, covering about 160,000 hectares out of a potential 500,000&#13;
hectares, include sugarcane, vegetables, fruits, sorghum and wheat, with rice cultivation&#13;
dominating by far. Livestock is the second most important export earner, accounting for 30&#13;
percent of export revenues.&#13;
1.03        Agroprocessing is by far the most important of the manufacturing subsectors.&#13;
According to a 1988 census, agroprocessing enterprises constitute half the total number of formal&#13;
manufacturing enterprises, and contribute 50 percent of gross production, 73 percent of value&#13;
added, and 55 percent of employment in the formal manufacturing sector. These numbers do not&#13;
include the few enterprises that specialize in exporting fruits and vegetables. Still, a considerable&#13;
share of agricultural trading and processing is handled in the rural areas by small entrepreneurs in&#13;
the informal sector, and particularly by women. These activities contribute more than two thirds&#13;
of value added and employment in the informal sector. When informal artisanal activities are&#13;
figured in, agroprocessing accounts for about 7 percent of GDP, and nearly 10 percent of&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
B. Characteristics of Sector Enterprises&#13;
1.04         Agricultural trading and processing activities in Mali are carried out by a wide&#13;
variety of enterprises, which can classified in four major categories:&#13;
(a)   a small group (15) of medium and large formal agroprocessing enterprises&#13;
employing 10 or more persons; most of which were public enterprises undergoing&#13;
rehabilitation programs, and which can now receive support from APEP and the&#13;
IFC regional branches (APDF/AEF), and need not be supported by this project;&#13;
(b)   a limited number (10) of enterprises specialized in the export of fruits and&#13;
vegetables;&#13;
(c)   a larger number (80) of small formal sector enterpises. mostly small,&#13;
geographically dispersed rural entities using low productivity traditional&#13;
technologies to produce low quality food and agro-industrial products destined for&#13;
local consumption; and&#13;
(d)   thousands of small informal enterprises engaged in marketing and artisanal&#13;
processing of agricultural products, mostly family part time enterprises using&#13;
rudimentary techniques and little or no equipment.&#13;
C. Recent Performances and Constraints to Sector Growth&#13;
1.05        Mali's performance in the areas of market gains for agro-processed products has&#13;
not been satisfactory. The country has either lost or been unable to gain shares on regional or&#13;
intemational markets for grains, meat, hides and skins, fruits and vegetables, and is far from fully&#13;
exploiting its domestic market for these products. For example, Malian exports of mangoes&#13;
plateau-ed from 1980 to 1990 at an average of 1,200 tons, losing European market shares (from&#13;
14 percent in 1985 to 6 percent in 1990) to some of its neighbors. According to BCEAO&#13;
statistics, exports of hides and skins and of sheanuts are stagnant and extremely unstable. They&#13;
have apparently ranged in the last two decades anywhere from 150 to 2,000 tons for hides and&#13;
skins, and from 300 to 8,000 tons for shea nuts. On the domestic market, Mali has had trouble&#13;
not only in diversifying production, but also in managing agricultural surpluses and their high&#13;
seasonality, particularly for grain and horticultural products. Losses due to inadequate marketing,&#13;
storage and handling range from 30 percent (onions) to 50 percent (mangoes). A wide range of&#13;
processed products, cereals (particularly maize), dried fruits and vegetables, dried and smoked&#13;
fish and meat, fruits, juices, jams and spices are being produced by small artisanal entrepreneurs&#13;
who have difficulty gaining access to the markets, to appropriate technologies and/or to financing.&#13;
1.06         The relevant sector and project preparation work has identified key bottlenecks to&#13;
the development of private agricultural marketing and processing enterprises:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(a)   Limited access to information on market opportunities, fiscal and investment&#13;
incentives, and export/import and transport regulations;&#13;
(b)   Limited know-how of post-harvest and marketing technologies and techniques;&#13;
and weak and scattered support to private agroprocessing entrepreneurs;&#13;
(c)   Weak and limited number of professional associations;&#13;
(d)   Inadequate access to credit, particularly in rural areas;&#13;
(e)   Lack and/or low quality of rural infrastructure; and&#13;
(f)   Ineffective quality control for both exported and agroprocessed products.&#13;
D. Sector Growth Persnectives&#13;
1.07        There is strong demand on European markets for many Malian agricultural&#13;
products, such as mangoes and green beans. Potentially profitable market niches also exist for&#13;
non-traditional products such as shea nuts, cashews, and gum resin. Mali's 1992 household&#13;
consumption survey has also shown surprisingly high demand for fruits and vegetables, especially&#13;
in urban areas. The high rate of urban population growth, and the anticipated improvements in&#13;
per capita incomes, should greatly increase market demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy&#13;
products, and processed foods, as weil as for other agroindustrial products such as animal feed,&#13;
soap, shoes, etc. Similar growth is expected in neighboring coastal countries, thus providing&#13;
opportunities for increased regional exports of potatoes, onions, and livestock products.&#13;
1.08        These growth prospects have greatly improved since the recent CFAF devaluation.&#13;
Livestock exports to the West African coastal countries have already rebounded, sales of&#13;
cottonseed oil and other edible oils on regional export markets have expanded, and the outlook&#13;
for import substitution for locally-processed cereals, fruits and vegetables, dairy products,&#13;
cooking oil, shea nut soap, leather and textiles is promising.&#13;
IL POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. Government Stratefv in the Rural Sector&#13;
2.01        Mali started a stabilization and structural adjustment program in 1982, but&#13;
adjustment efforts did not become serious until 1988, when the Government began to implement a&#13;
wide range of economic and institutional reforms. These reforms included domestic marketing&#13;
and price liberalization, reform of the regulatory framework and tax regime, public enterprise&#13;
restructuring and privatization, and the elimination of trade distortions. The civil service wage bill&#13;
has been kept in check and the share of social program expenditures in the recurrent budget has&#13;
been steadily increased. These measures have improved economic incentives and have allowed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
market forces greater play in determining economic outcomes. In addition, the transparency and&#13;
efficiency of public resource allocation have improved. Real GDP annual growth rates have&#13;
jumped from less than 2 percent in the early 1980s to about 3.7 percent over the 1988-92 period.&#13;
The overall fiscal deficit shrank from a high of 13.9 percent of GDP in 1985 to 7.7 percent in&#13;
1990. In 1993, however, the deficit rose again to 9.6 percent of GDP, and the balance of&#13;
payments performance was adversely affected by the drop in world prices for cotton, the main&#13;
export crop.&#13;
2.02         An important macroeconomic development has been the 50 percent devaluation of&#13;
the CFA franc, decided in January 1994 by the Governments of the CFAF zone to which Mali&#13;
belongs. This important decision should boost Mali's ongoing structural adjustment efforts and&#13;
provide greater opportunities for economic growth. Already, livestock exports and prices have&#13;
increased by more than 30 percent, cotton exports and revenues have doubled, and cotton&#13;
production is expected to increase by about 50 percent in the next three years. A fourth PFP&#13;
(1994-96) has been negotiated and agreed upon with the Government: it outlines a set of&#13;
measures intended to accompany the devaluation to help restrain its inflationary impact and ensure&#13;
that significant real depreciation is achieved. It also emphasizes the importance of continuing&#13;
reform efforts, notably in agriculture, infrastructure, and public enterprise, as well as in the&#13;
regulatory and incentive framework. As a result of effective implementation of most of the&#13;
accompanying reforms, economic performance in 1994 has been impressive, with inflation holding&#13;
steady at the projected rate of 35 percent, well below the 50 percent plus rates reached in some&#13;
other CFAF countries, a 40 percent depreciation in the real exchange rate and substantial&#13;
improvements in the fiscal deficit. Should such performance continue in the future, the improved&#13;
competitiveness of agricultural and agro-processed products would be a lasting achievement.&#13;
2.03         Government has also redefined its agricultural development strategy in close&#13;
collaboration with donors, including the Bank. A long-term Master Plan for Rural Development&#13;
has been drawn up, along with a medium-term action plan aimed at refocusing the activities of the&#13;
Ministry of Rural Development on public service functions, and on streamlining its institutions.&#13;
The key objectives of the Government's agricultural development strategy are: (a) to further&#13;
disengage Government from commercial activities and promote private sector initiative in such&#13;
activities; (b) to provide adequate training for rural organizations which will be assigned lead roles&#13;
in the identification and implementation of group activities; (c) to decentralize and streamline the&#13;
administration to improve the effectiveness of local support services; and (d) to modernize Mali's&#13;
low input/output agriculture through improved extension and agricultural research.  In this&#13;
context, the strategy consolidates the liberalization of agricultural markets, and limits the&#13;
Government's role in marketing to that of manager of a food security stock.  In the&#13;
agroprocessing subsector, the Government's strategy focuses on four policy orientations: (a)&#13;
financial rehabilitation, restructuring and/or privatization of public agroprocessing enterprises; (b)&#13;
provision of incentives, via the investment code, in favor of rural-based enterprises; (c) support to&#13;
the creation of active professional organizations; and (d) the improvement, through technical and&#13;
institutional support, of the economics of agroprocessing in order to stimulate private investment&#13;
in the subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Environment for Private Sector Development&#13;
2.04         Along with macroeconomic stabilization programs, the Government has put in&#13;
place important regulatory, marketing and pricing policy reforms aimed at fostering private sector&#13;
development, such as:&#13;
(a)    streamlining of regulations and administrative procedures, to make it easier for&#13;
private entrepreneurs to engage in production and trade activities;&#13;
(b)    amendments to the labor code to facilitate hiring and dismissal;&#13;
(c)    elimination of price controls, except for petroleum products;&#13;
(d)   liberalization of trade policies, with the abolition of quantitative restrictions, the&#13;
replacement of import licensing with a system of automatic registration, etc.;&#13;
(e)   reductions in the tax burden of formal sector enterprises; and&#13;
(f)   financial rehabilitation, restructuring, privatization, and/or liquidation of financially&#13;
strained public enterprises, etc..&#13;
2.05         Despite these reforms, numerous constraints to private sector development remain.&#13;
First, Mali's financial and business laws and regulations, based generally on those of France, are&#13;
too complex for Mali's still budding formal sector, making compliance time-consuming and&#13;
costly, especially for small businesses. Second, the judicial system is isolated from the business&#13;
community, lacks the appropriate specialized courts, and is thus unable to ensure the proper&#13;
enforcement of business laws and regulations that is needed to secure private investments. Third,&#13;
the complexity and diversity of taxes, and their high rate in some instances, are major impediments&#13;
to private sector development. Fourth, customs fraud results not only in the loss of Government&#13;
revenue, but also hinders the development of manufacturing activities, agroprocessing included.&#13;
Fifth, the investment code is strongly biased towards large investments, and small enterprises are&#13;
ill-informed and find it difficult to apply for and obtain the needed exemptions.&#13;
C. Institutional Framework&#13;
Government Institutions&#13;
2.06         Agricultural services have traditionally been rather weak, except in the CMDT and&#13;
Office du Niger (ON) intervention areas. These two state enterprises have been relatively&#13;
effective in providing technical support and in channeling financing to farmers. However, their&#13;
ability to provide support to agricultural trading and processing enterprises is extremely limited,&#13;
except in their respective areas of expertise, cotton and rice.&#13;
2.07         The Government, with the support of the IDA-financed Agricultural Services and&#13;
National Agricultural Research projects, has recently embarked on a rehabilitation program of its&#13;
research and extension services to cover areas outside CMDT and ON intervention. As a result,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
IER and PNVA, the beneficiary institutions, have seen their capabilities to provide support&#13;
enhanced, demand oriented and more effective. However, given the priorities accorded other&#13;
agricultural subsectors, such as cereals and livestock, support capabilities in agricultural trading&#13;
and processing have remained weak, and limited to attempts at improving traditional and low&#13;
technology processes, such as drying of tomatoes and onions. Currently, training in post-harvest&#13;
technologies is unavailable in Mali.&#13;
2.08         Government services in support of private business are weak.  The "Office&#13;
National de la Main d'Oeuvre et de l'Emploi" deals only with low-level skills. The "Centre&#13;
d'Assistance aux Projets, Entreprises et Societes" has the capacity to provide training in&#13;
management, accounting, and feasibility studies, but most of its efforts are currently geared&#13;
towards recent secondary school and university graduates who lack business skills and experience.&#13;
The IDA-financed Public Works Promotion Agency (AGETIPE) and Private Sector Promotion&#13;
Agency (APEP) are active in Mali. But AGETIPE's support is too specialized, and the small&#13;
informal agroprocessing enterprises, most of which are dispersed throughout rural Mali, have little&#13;
or no access to APEP's support which is mostly geared towards large formal enterprises.&#13;
Producer Organizations and Professional Associations&#13;
2.09         The Chamber of Agriculture of Mali (CAM), until recently under the strict control&#13;
of the Ministry of Rural Development, has undergone major changes in status and structure.&#13;
There are now eight Regional Chambers of Agriculture, composed of elected representatives of&#13;
the rural population, and which have a broader mandate to promote private sector initiatives, to&#13;
support professional organizations and producer interest groups, and to represent rural sector&#13;
interests. Coordination of policy and programs, and support to the Regional Chambers is assured&#13;
by the Permanent Assembly of the Malian Regional Chambers of Agriculture (APCAM). With&#13;
training, technical support, and hands-on experience, the Regional Chambers of Agriculture&#13;
should soon be able to play a leading role in providing various support services to private&#13;
entrepreneurs in the agricultural and the agroprocessing sectors.&#13;
2.10         The Malian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIM), although under the&#13;
tutelage of the Ministry of Commerce, is supposed to represent the interests of trade, industry,&#13;
handicrafts, and service enterprises vis-a-vis the Government, to provide technical and market&#13;
information to these enterprises, and to advise the Government on policies and regulations&#13;
affecting businesses. However, being essentially a state-controlled entity, and lacking the needed&#13;
personnel, data, documentation and access to information, the Chamber has shown little&#13;
effectiveness in providing support to business. The IDA-financed Private Sector Support Project&#13;
will provide support for the restructuring of the CCIM.&#13;
2.11         There are also some specialized professional associations involved with the&#13;
agricultural trading and processing subsectors. The "Reseau des Entreprises du Mali" is a&#13;
member of the "Reseau des Entreprises de l'Afrique de l'Ouest", which aims to develop private&#13;
business in West Africa by identifying the needs of the African private sector, lobbying to change&#13;
the regulatory framework, and promoting trade throughout the region. AMELEF was created by&#13;
the leading exporters to promote the professional and economic interests of fruits and vegetables&#13;
exporters. A cotton producers union, SYCOV, has already played a key role in negotiating&#13;
producer prices with CMDT. The Mutual Association of Hides and Leather (MPCP), the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Butchers Cooperative, and the Association of Livestock Traders are active in the livestock&#13;
subsector.&#13;
2.12        Producers' organizations designed for input provision and/or product marketing,&#13;
such as cooperatives, pre-cooperatives and other "groupements", proliferated until the mid-&#13;
1980s, their creation most often initiated by Government agencies and their operations supported&#13;
by the administration and/or by development projects. However, as part of its disengagement&#13;
policy, the Government has stepped back from direct interference and allowed them a high degree&#13;
of autonomy. With the decrease in Governmental support and subsidies, many have stopped&#13;
operations. Malian legislation has also recently provided for the creation of economically and&#13;
commercially-oriented organizations called "Groupements d'Interet Economique" (GIE), usually&#13;
involving fewer than ten members who pool their resources for development activities, and who&#13;
are jointly responsible for the repayment of credit.  Unlike most of the traditional "Tons&#13;
Villageois" and "Associations Villageoises" (AV), which usually have community-based and&#13;
socially-oriented activities, cooperatives and GIEs can play a key role in providing extension&#13;
services, input supply, product marketing, and access to and reimbursement of credit.&#13;
Other National and International Support Organizations&#13;
2.13         It is estimated that about 200 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operate in&#13;
Mali. Only a few are specialized in supporting agroprocessing activities. NGOs often depend on&#13;
fluctuating financial assistance from the donor community, and their programs, usually of limited&#13;
scope, are often relatively uncoordinated with each other.  However, their closeness to&#13;
beneficiaries and their reliance on strong beneficiary participation are positive factors that make&#13;
NGOs key partners in any decentralized development activity. CMDT, for example, is relying to&#13;
an increasing degree on contractual arrangements with NGOs for the implementation of specific&#13;
activities in its area of influence.&#13;
2.14         CECI is a Canadian NGO, funded by the Canadian Agency for International&#13;
Development, which specializes in providing technical assistance to small agroprocessing&#13;
activities in developing countries. It has extensive experience in promoting appropriate food&#13;
drying technologies (meat, fish, fruits and vegetables) and cereals processing in Mali, with&#13;
projects in the Mopti and Kayes regions, in Burkina Faso, and in other neighboring countries.&#13;
The FED/PME/PMI is a European Development Fund financed project which provides financing&#13;
to small and medium size enterprises, through regional agencies recently transformed into&#13;
decentralized financial institutions called "Credit Initiative". "PAPME Canada" is a similar&#13;
project now being completed, with funding available for another year but restricted to provision&#13;
of technical assistance to private entrepreneurs in their marketing activities. The "Programme&#13;
pour la Valorisation des Cereales Locales dans le Sahel (PROCELOS), a 'Comite Inter-Etats de&#13;
Lutte contre la Secheresse ans le Sahel (CILSS) program active in Burkina Faso, Mali and&#13;
Senegal, is promoting the processing of local grains. Support is provided to small and medium&#13;
enterprises via local consulting firms and consists of the provision of technical and market&#13;
information, local market promotion for specific products, and individual counseling on technical&#13;
and managerial matters.&#13;
2.15         The Liaison Committee for Europe, Africa and the Caribbean (COLEACP), an&#13;
international organization supported partially by the European Development Fund, is active in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
promoting trade in tropical fruits, off-season vegetables, ornamental plants, and flowers and&#13;
spices. In addition to its traditional functions of disseminating market information and providing&#13;
training and technical expertise in export promotion, it is currently coordinating a Sahel-wide&#13;
effort to import the export business and enhance coordination of export policies and programs.&#13;
D. Financial Intermediation and Access to Credit&#13;
2.16         Farmers and agroprocessing entrepreneurs have limited access to credit to finance&#13;
productive medium and long term investments. Agricultural credit accounts for a small share of&#13;
total credit to the economy, and the bulk of extended credit is for short-term financing of less than&#13;
two years. In 1991, the ratio of agricultural to total credit was 39 percent for short-term loans,&#13;
and only 2 percent for long and medium term loans. Within the agricultural portfolio, 98 percent&#13;
of loans are seasonal short-term credits that finance farm inputs and crop marketing. Rural&#13;
development agencies and projects, especially CMDT and Office du Niger, play a prominent&#13;
intermediary role in formal credit allocation and management, channeling about 90 percent of all&#13;
agricultural credit.&#13;
2.17         Until recently, banks have operated under financial policies that discouraged&#13;
lending to private operators. They have been even more reluctant to lend to small formal and&#13;
informal enterprises, which are characterized by a limited knowledge of markets and marketing&#13;
skills, of technical processes, and by very weak capabilities in the design and presentation of&#13;
investment projects. Unwillingness of banks to provide investment lending is also due to their own&#13;
weaknesses, limited contact and knowledge of small rural entrepreneurs, their limited experience&#13;
in lending to them, and weak capabilities in appraising the financial viability and risks of&#13;
agroprocessing activities.&#13;
2.18         Within the context of the recent liberalization of financial markets, a money market&#13;
was introduced by BCEAO that pays the prevailing rate of interest (8 percent to 9 percent) only&#13;
on that portion of offered funds for which there is a solvent demand. As this proportion has fallen&#13;
to less than 50 percent of banks' deposits with BCEAO, banks now have a growing incentive to&#13;
use their excess liquidity for lending to the private sector.  Also, the savings and loan&#13;
cooperatives, which traditionally recycled their excess resources with the banks, will now be more&#13;
inclined to extend medium- and long-term credit. An increased dialogue between businesses and&#13;
financial institutions, promoted by this pilot project, will result in the design of risk-reducing&#13;
programs and mechanisms that will likely increase the availability of investment lending to private&#13;
enterprises, and increase the access to long- and medium-term credit of agroprocessing firms.&#13;
m. IDA STRATEGY&#13;
A. Country Assistance Strateev&#13;
3.01         The Bank's strategy for Mali's rural sector is consistent with Government policy&#13;
orientations and includes the following objectives: (a) to improve the enabling environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
needed to enhance business opportunities for the private sector and encourage disengagement of&#13;
the State from commercial activities; (b) to improve technical support to producers through more&#13;
effective research and extension, in order to boost and diversify production as well as to improve&#13;
the international competitiveness of Malian exports; (c) to enhance training for, and promote&#13;
active participation of, rural groups in the design and implementation of rural development&#13;
activities; (d) to promote private investment in irrigation and the selective rehabilitation of existing&#13;
schemes rather than the construction of new ones; (e) to promote private investment in&#13;
agricultural trading and processing; (f) to support a comprehensive natural resource management&#13;
program and the creation of a legal and institutional framework giving local communities more&#13;
authority and accountability in its implementation, as well as reforms aimed at intensifying&#13;
production through appropriate land use policies; and (g) to improve infrastructure and transport.&#13;
B. IDA Portfolio&#13;
3.02         IDA's portfolio in the Malian rural sector has closely matched the above strategy.&#13;
Ongoing operations include the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (AGSECAL, Cr. 2163-&#13;
MLI) approved in 1991, the Office du Niger Consolidation Project (Cr. 1906-MLI) approved in&#13;
1988, the Agricultural Services project (Cr. 2235-MLI) approved in 1991, the Natural Resources&#13;
Management project (Cr. 2370-MLI) approved in 1992, the National Research project approved&#13;
in 1993, and the Bank-administered Norwegian grant to support a Local Community&#13;
Development Project (PDCL) in the Mopti region. Recently phased-out operations include the&#13;
Mopti Area Development Project (Cr. 1597-MLl, closed in 1993) and the Forestry II project (Cr.&#13;
1654-MLI, closed in 1993). Following the Major Transport Sector Project approved recently, a&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Project, including rural water supply and rural roads, is now under&#13;
preparation.&#13;
3.03         First, an environment more conducive to private sector response to market signals&#13;
has been established under the AGSECAL, particularly for cereals and cotton. Cereals pricing&#13;
and marketing have been liberalized, and Government intervention, through Office des Produits&#13;
Agricoles du Mali (OPAM), has been streamlined and confined to the maintenance of a food&#13;
security stock and the management of food aid. In the cotton sector, producer prices are&#13;
negotiated by producers and CMDT, and are reviewed annually in light of export prices. The&#13;
Cotton Stabilization Fund is used to mitigate the impact on domestic prices of short-term&#13;
fluctuations in world market prices, and farmers are now involved in its management. Second,&#13;
the State's disengagement from the rice sector is being implemented under the Office du Niger&#13;
operation. All industrial and commercial activities are being transferred to the private sector or to&#13;
privately-managed entities, since the role of ON is now limited to maintenance of irrigation&#13;
infrastructure, to selective rehabilitation of that infrastructure, and to provision of extension&#13;
services. Efforts are also under way to improve the productivity of ON by strengthening its&#13;
managerial capacity and restructuring its finances. Third, an effort to improve farm productivity&#13;
and promote more sustainable agriculture is in progress and includes: (a) the reorganization of&#13;
extension services, with the support of the Agricultural Services Project, to make them more&#13;
effective in disseminating messages relevant to agriculture, livestock and natural resource&#13;
management, while strengthening the research/extension linkage; (b) the development of more&#13;
efficient farm-level technologies that improve returns on investment and decrease production&#13;
costs, through the Agricultural Research Project and via reforms in the national agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
research system aimed at improving research coherence, quality, relevance and accountability; and&#13;
(c) the provision, through the Natural Resources Management Project, of necessary support to&#13;
village communities to enable them to establish, implement, and monitor village-level natural&#13;
resource management plans. Fourth, the rural development activities of local groups are being&#13;
promoted under the Bank-administered PDCL, through provision of training to producer groups&#13;
in the design and management of flood-recession rice perimeters, range lands, pastures and other&#13;
off-farm activities.&#13;
3.04         An environment more conducive to private investment is also being promoted in&#13;
Mali with the support of such IDA projects as SALs and a Private Sector Development Project.&#13;
Under the latter project, the Agency for the Promotion of Private Entreprises (APEP), as well as&#13;
IFC's regional branches (APDF/AEF), are providing technical support to medium and large&#13;
private enterprises. The proposed project will focus on types of support not yet provided by these&#13;
agencies, to beneficiaries too small or too remote to take advantage of their services. It has been&#13;
agreed with APEP and APDF that requests for technical support from large agribusiness should&#13;
be referred to them. Coordination and complementarity will be further pursued with the&#13;
Transport Sector Project, which is aimed at alleviating many infrastructure constraints and with a&#13;
Private Irrigation Promotion Project currently under preparation. The proposed project will also&#13;
contribute in the identification of priority needs for rural infrastructure to be considered under the&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Project under preparation.&#13;
C. Lessons from Past Lending Experiences&#13;
3.05         Lessons from the Bank's lending experience in agriculture suggest, first, that&#13;
farmers and agroprocessing entrepreneurs are responsive to improved and profitable technologies,&#13;
and are prepared to invest time and resources to adopt them. One can cite the example of rice&#13;
transplantation techniques and the use of organic manure, which have been adopted on an&#13;
impressive scale over the last few years. Second, individual farmers or groups are able and willing&#13;
to play important roles in designing and managing rural development activities. Over the last few&#13;
years, private small-scale irrigation schemes have proliferated despite the lack of Government&#13;
support. Under PDCL's natural resource management operations, producer groups have also&#13;
shown increasing enthusiasm and willingness to take important initiatives in implementing project&#13;
activities. Third, centralized project management by the Government tends to lose sight of&#13;
farmers' constraints and priorities. Results from the Mopti Area Development Project clearly&#13;
indicate that the project's centralized management unit, in addition to being ill-placed to react to&#13;
complex local conditions, was handicapped by inefficient administrative procedures as well as by&#13;
weak management, and that the local communities and private sector entities were insufficiently&#13;
involved in project planning and implementation. Thus, there is a need to tap the management&#13;
skills of professionally oriented and decentralized institutions to coordinate and implement&#13;
Government-financed operations in the rural sector. This "private provision of public services"&#13;
approach, received favorably by Government, as illustrated by the AGETIPE and Private Sector&#13;
Promotion projects, will be used for the proposed project.&#13;
3.06         IDA's experience with projects channeling support to small agricultural trading&#13;
and processing enterprises through professional organizations is rather recent, hence the pilot&#13;
format of this project. Implementation of other ongoing agroprocessing projects in Sub-Saharan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11-&#13;
Africa has shown there is a need for strong technical supervision and stringent auditing&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation procedures. Given the relative success of the AGETIPE approach in&#13;
providing support to the private sector in Mali and other neighboring countries, this project will&#13;
incorporate many of the AGETIPE features that relate to the management, supervision,&#13;
monitoring, auditing, and evaluation procedures.&#13;
D. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.07         This project fits well within IDA's country assistance strategy of promoting private&#13;
sector development. The high growth potential and improved competitiveness makes agricultural&#13;
trading and processing a priority sector for private investment, and puts it in a position to make&#13;
significant contributions to the Government's key policy objectives of employment creation and&#13;
income generation, especially in rural areas. Given the predominance of small and geographically&#13;
dispersed enterprises, there is real scope for broad-based growth that will help alleviate poverty,&#13;
slow rural migration, and increase household food security for both urban and rural populations.&#13;
The sector's growth will also significantly increase the participation level and productivity of&#13;
women, who are traditionally very active in agricultural trading and processing.&#13;
3.08         This project capitalizes on and supplements sector adjustment programs. The&#13;
small formal and informal enterprises to be supported under this project complement the larger&#13;
privatized firms, as they can fill market niches inaccessible to the latter. The export promotion&#13;
component, by capitalizing on the market liberalization measures and on the recent trade and&#13;
exchange policies, will contribute to improvement in the balance of payment, through increased&#13;
exports.&#13;
3.09         This pilot project will test the feasibility and effectiveness of providing support to&#13;
private sector enterprises through professional associations. The lessons to be drawn from this&#13;
project will be useful to other IDA programs/projects not only in Mali, but also in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT'&#13;
A. Proiect Concept and Composition&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.01         This project's long term objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   induce sustained output growth in the agricultural trading and processing&#13;
subsector, through increased exports to European and regional markets, and&#13;
through import substitution on the local market;&#13;
(b)   contribute to increasing incomes, particularly in the rural areas and for women, and&#13;
to alleviate poverty;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
(c)    help reduce current unemployment, by creating jobs particularly in rural and semi-&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
4.02          To achieve a sustained output growth would require that the project help&#13;
agribusiness, traders, exporters, and producers, become capable of achieving better adequacy of&#13;
products to consumer preferences, improved and more uniform product quality, increased&#13;
timeliness and regularity of product delivery, and lower costs throughout the marketing chain.&#13;
The project should also seek sustained improvements in the ability of professional organizations&#13;
and chambers of agriculture active in the subsector to select, manage, and finance support services&#13;
to private entrepreneurs. Hence, the project's development objectives are to:&#13;
(a)    enhance the technical and managerial capabilities of private entrepreneurs involved&#13;
in the agricultural trading and processing subsector;&#13;
(b)    demonstrate the feasibility of alternative export channels (such as maritime&#13;
shipment for mangoes) and expand the use of low cost processing and storing&#13;
technologies;&#13;
(c)    help entrepreneurs identify and get access to new markets for their products;&#13;
(d)    facilitate the development of business relationships between private agricultural&#13;
trading processing enterprises and formal and informal financial institutions;&#13;
(e)    help chambers of agriculture and professional associations build their own&#13;
capabilities for provision of demand driven support services to private&#13;
entrepreneurs.&#13;
4.03          The project will also seek to:&#13;
(a)    improve the adequacy of quality control, extension, and research services provided&#13;
by public institutions by establishing consultation and financing processes involving&#13;
beneficiaries to make them more demand driven and market oriented;&#13;
(b)    test the efficiency of a private type agency, using expeditious and flexible&#13;
procedures, to provide support to private sector enterprises; and&#13;
(c)    test alternative channels (chambers of agriculture and professional organizations)&#13;
for beneficiaries' participation in the definition of priorities and provision of&#13;
services to the private sector.&#13;
Beneficiaries&#13;
4.04          The project's intended beneficiaries can be divided into two groups. First, there are&#13;
all entrepreneurs in the private sector involved in selected key agroprocessing subsectors,&#13;
including  producers,  pickers  and  handlers,  packagers,  transporters,  processors  and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13-&#13;
traders/exporters. These consist mostly of small enterprises who use unskilled labor from the&#13;
informal sector in rural or semi-urban areas and whom the project will help expand their&#13;
professional skills and activities, as key contributors to the performance of the subsector. Women&#13;
(para. 1.03) have traditionally played a key role in handling, processing and packaging agricultural&#13;
products, and during the appraisal, it was agreed with Government that the Committee for the&#13;
Promotion of Women (under the Prime Minister) launch with the help of this project a specific&#13;
training program for women involved in key agroprocessing subsectors. Second, there are the&#13;
professional associations and the chambers of agriculture (paras. 2.09, 2.11), created by their&#13;
members to provide collective services to them, such as market information, quality control,&#13;
training, representation. The project will help these existing and representative bodies in their&#13;
efforts to enhance their capabilities to provide services to their constituencies.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
4.05         This five-year pilot project would address key sector constraints to private&#13;
investment in agricultural processing and marketing, and would focus primarily on capacity-&#13;
building and on the transfer of know-how to the private sector through information networks,&#13;
training, specialized TA, and study tours. The project will also gradually transfer responsibilities&#13;
of the services which will prove most needed and cost-efficient during the pilot operation to&#13;
Chambers of Agriculture and Professional organizations. The project would pursue a two-&#13;
pronged approach: (a) provision of polyvalent support in three regions to all profitable&#13;
agroprocessing private entrepreneurs, upstream and downstream of agricultural production, and&#13;
(b) transfer of specialized expertise to enterprises operating in subsectors or product lines with a&#13;
high potential for international export which require high-quality standards, such as fresh and&#13;
dried fruits and vegetables, hides and skins, and shea nuts and other exotic products.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
4.06         The project will have four components:&#13;
(a)   Decentralized Support in the Sikasso. Segou and Mopti regions (US$2,500,000&#13;
base costs!&#13;
(i)    Promotional and technical assistance. In each region, the project will help&#13;
exporters, traders, processors, producers, transporters to organize marketing&#13;
campaigns for selected key subsectors. As many of these actors are currently&#13;
poorly organized and skilled, key products for these regions do not compete well&#13;
on their potential markets. During preparation, potential beneficiaries have&#13;
identified potatoes, mangoes, dried fruits, and maize as key products for Sikasso,&#13;
and onions and rice as key products for Segou. Key products for the Mopti region&#13;
are likely to be livestock by-products and dried fish, as well as vegetables.&#13;
The promotional and technical assistance packages, some of which were tested in&#13;
Sikasso during project preparation, are likely to include the following activities and&#13;
steps:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
(1)   establishing marketing targets and promotion campaigns, mostly with&#13;
exporters and traders, based on market studies and contacts in potential&#13;
markets;&#13;
(2)   organizing workshops and visits with actors involved, including research&#13;
and extension services, to identify quantity, quality of products, timing of&#13;
harvest, delivery, transport, and marketing and support needed at each&#13;
step, and prepare a detailed campaign program;&#13;
(3)    organizing meetings and field trips with rural financial institutions and&#13;
banks on the basis of this detailed campaign program;&#13;
(4)   organizing applied research, demonstrations, and extension services on&#13;
production, post-harvest, marketing and agroprocessing technologies, to be&#13;
implemented through, or in collaboration with, the national extension and&#13;
research services;&#13;
(5)   organizing and financing fairs, competitions, seminars, inter- and intra-&#13;
professional workshops;&#13;
(6)    setting and implementing quality control mechanisms, with entrepreneurs&#13;
and public services, and providing them with the appropriate training;&#13;
(7)    monitoring the implementation of marketing programs at all stages,&#13;
including post market studies on targeted markets, and organizing&#13;
workshops to review and draw practical lessons from the results of the&#13;
marketing program.&#13;
(ii)   Training and Information services. As indicated in sector studies and as&#13;
experienced in the Sikasso test, most private entrepreneurs in rural and semi-urban&#13;
areas, from producers to traders and exporters, are lacking essential information&#13;
and knowledge about contractual, legal, regulatory, financial procedures, about&#13;
potential markets, agroprocessing and storage technologies, and about marketing&#13;
techniques and advertising techniques. Based on an annual survey of priority&#13;
needs of the beneficiaries, the project will thus provide training and information to&#13;
them with the following activities:&#13;
(1)    collecting and disseminating market information (price, quantities) on&#13;
national, regional and international markets, through rural radio programs&#13;
and publications (such programs are already being used for dissemination&#13;
of market information on local grain);&#13;
(2)    collecting and disseminating legal, fiscal, contractual, and regulatory&#13;
information relevant to agroprocessing and exporting activities, to help&#13;
producers and informal traders use simple contracts when dealing with&#13;
exporters or importers (brochures and displays, presenting simple contract&#13;
format, fiscal and quality standard requirements, and possibly specific&#13;
workshops will be prepared with project technical assistance and&#13;
financing); and&#13;
(3)   organizing technical workshops, field visits, or "open houses" to publicize&#13;
and demonstrate "good practices" and innovations for production, post-&#13;
harvest, marketing, storage and agroprocessing technologies developed&#13;
through filed trials and demonstration programs (started during preparation&#13;
in Sikasso) for existing low-cost technologies for cool storage and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
products drying, the project providing technical assistance and financing for&#13;
these activities conducted in close coordination with the national extension&#13;
and research services.&#13;
(iii)   Construction and rehabilitation of wholesale market facilities. Sikasso, Segou and&#13;
Mopti need proper public wholesale marketing facilities with appropriate cool&#13;
storage areas to enhance the quality and reduce the loss of fresh products. The&#13;
project includes provisions to finance such public facilities in each region. A&#13;
preliminary project for a simple market infrastructure with low-cost cool storage&#13;
was presented by the Sikasso Chamber of Agriculture at appraisal. The preparation&#13;
of feasibility studies, the procurement of the works, their preparation and&#13;
supervision, and the procurement of the lease contract for the management of the&#13;
facilities will be subcontracted to AGETIPE or other qualified specialists.&#13;
(iv)   Lease. use and costs recovery arrangements for wholesale markets facilities. The&#13;
project will provide technical assistance to prepare and monitor the subcontracting&#13;
arrangements (para. 4.32), and to set up and monitor the lease, use and cost&#13;
recovery arrangements for the wholesale market facilities. The management and&#13;
maintenance of these facilities will be delegated under a lease contract, on the&#13;
basis of which the lesser will be able to collect user-fees from beneficiaries.&#13;
(v)    Individualized on-demand technical assistance to entrepreneurs. The project will&#13;
provide technical assistance on request to private entrepreneurs with a specific&#13;
project, on a fee basis (para. 4.21). This support will be mostly subcontracted to&#13;
match the specific needs of each individual request. These services are likely to&#13;
include:&#13;
(1)   individual consultations to help identify the market and the appropriate&#13;
marketing channel and advertising strategy, as well as the appropriate&#13;
product quality and packaging and processing technologies;&#13;
(2)    guidance and implementation of  tests on improved technologies for&#13;
processing, storage, packaging and on handling and transport strategy;&#13;
(3)   identification of regulations and procedures for establishing  a business&#13;
enterprise, partnerships, and contractual arrangements;&#13;
(4)    preparation of complete feasibility studies and support to search for&#13;
financing;&#13;
(5)    assistance in accounting  and  management systems and  procedures,&#13;
including procurement, work organization, fiscal obligations, obtaining&#13;
investment code and other incentives; and&#13;
(6)    follow-up and technical back-up during implementation of project.&#13;
(vi)   Institutional strengthening of the Regional Chambers of Agriculture. The chambers&#13;
of agriculture, representative bodies for all entrepreneurs involved in agricultural&#13;
and agroprocessing activities, have a crucial role to play in supporting project&#13;
activities in the field, and will be closely associated to all services provided under&#13;
the component of decentralized support in the three regions. One key objective of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
the project is to gradually transfer the provision of essential services, tested in the&#13;
context of this pilot project, to the chambers of agriculture. In order to do so, the&#13;
project will provide technical assistance, training (workshops and study tours)&#13;
and equipment to chambers of agriculture in Sikasso, Segou and Mopti to insure&#13;
sufficient capacity of their elected representatives and staff to take over the&#13;
provision of selected key services. Those services could include:&#13;
(1)    market organization, such as setting up of market days, and organization of&#13;
the set-up, the management and maintenance of   market facilities,&#13;
particularly wholesale markets;&#13;
(2)    provision of market information from  other regions of Mali or from&#13;
potential neighboring markets;&#13;
(3)    participation  in the organization  of specific  extension  and  research&#13;
programs;&#13;
(4)    organization of information and training workshops on simple contract&#13;
format, product quality standard, agroprocessing technologies;&#13;
(5)    organization of local fairs and study tours, to attract potential market&#13;
partners for the region;&#13;
(6)    organization of regular contacts, field tours for rural financial institutions&#13;
and banks to foster their involvement into key agroprocessing sub-sectors;&#13;
and&#13;
(7)    monitoring of lease contracts for wholesale markets.&#13;
(b)    Support packages to subsector professional associations (US$ 2.031.000 base&#13;
costs). Support packages will be provided to three subsector professional associations&#13;
dealing with high-value products for sophisticated and competitive markets, AMELEF&#13;
(fruits and vegetables exports), MPCP (hides and skins exports), and another association&#13;
active in the sheanut/oilseeds subsector. These packages will include (i) institutional&#13;
strengthening of these professional associations with specialized TA, training, intemships,&#13;
research, study funds and equipment, and (ii) construction and rehabilitation of collective&#13;
facilities related to the activities of these professional associations.&#13;
(i)    Institutional strengthening of professional associations.The project will provide&#13;
mostly specialized technical assistance (US$1,438,000), with teams of international&#13;
and local experts, as well as funding for training, study tours, internships and fairs,&#13;
for research packages will also be available to the professional associations.&#13;
Finally, the project will provide basic office equipment to selected professional&#13;
associations. This support aims at helping these associations organize and provide&#13;
the following support services to their members and to the entire marketing chain&#13;
in their subsector:&#13;
(1)    conducting market studies particularly on European markets (but also&#13;
emerging middle-east markets) and providing updated market information;&#13;
(2)    designing market strategies, including quality level, target markets, and&#13;
timing of exports, as well as transport strategies (for fresh products, air&#13;
freight or maritime shipments);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
(3)   conducting tests, with limited quantities (as was done during preparation&#13;
with mangoes, and hides and skins);&#13;
(4)    organizing targeted training and supervision for export trials and camnpaigns&#13;
for entrepreneurs involved in production, handling, processing and&#13;
transport of products, with the support of the national extension and&#13;
research services;&#13;
(5)   training to exporters and traders for contracts, insurance, letters of credit,&#13;
and preparation of requests for bank financing;&#13;
(6)   identifying research priorities and subcontracting research packages to a&#13;
research institution;&#13;
(7)    contacting importers, and ensuring representation in importing countries&#13;
and in fairs,&#13;
(8)   negotiating transport and/or freight agreements;&#13;
(9)    participating in the design of standards and packaging, based on updated&#13;
information on regulations and consumer demands on targeted foreign&#13;
markets;&#13;
(10)  lobbying Government for appropriate incentives and participating in the&#13;
management of STABEX requests and funds;&#13;
(11)  designing promotion strategies for the subsector; and&#13;
(12)  reinforcing cooperation with comparable associations in neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
(ii)    Construction and/or rehabilitation of collective facilities. The project will also&#13;
finance the rehabilitation and/or creation of handling and processing collective&#13;
storage facilities needed for exportation of fruits and vegetables, hides and skins or&#13;
other products, and organize the use and cost recovery of these facilities through&#13;
lease arrangements. The preparation of feasibility studies, the procurement of the&#13;
works, their preparation and supervision, and the procurement of the lease&#13;
contract for the management of the facilities will be subcontracted to AGETIPE or&#13;
other qualified specialists.&#13;
(c)    Agency's Management and the Agricultural Processing and Marketing Information&#13;
Exchange Network (US$1,084,000 base costs). The project will provide funding for the&#13;
Agency's headquarters, to be located in Bamako, from which coordination, supervision&#13;
and backstopping will be provided to the regional branches and to the professional&#13;
associations.Technical backstopping to decentralized support activities and to the support&#13;
packages to the professional associations will be provided through the agricultural&#13;
processing and marketing exchange information network. The network's activities will be&#13;
closely coordinated with the other components of the project and will also be coordinated&#13;
with databases from other projects, such as APEP's, and will include: (i) market studies&#13;
and consumer surveys, (ii) establishment and regular updates of a roster for consultants,&#13;
resource people and institutions (NGOs), and (iii) establishment and operation of a data&#13;
bank on agricultural trading and processing activities.&#13;
(i)    Market studies and consumer surveys. These will relate to key subsectors selected&#13;
for support, both on Malian markets and on neighboring countries. The preliminary&#13;
market studies conducted during the preparation in Dakar and Abidjan have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
provided already valuable information to guide the selection of activities of the&#13;
regional programs. These surveys will be subcontracted.&#13;
(ii)   Establishment and regular updates of a roster for consultants. This roster will be&#13;
organized according to specific skills and experience, and prequalifications to&#13;
perform subcontracted technical assistance, studies and training in the context of&#13;
the project. This network will also maintain a roster of resource persons and&#13;
institutions with experience and competencies in the agroprocessing sector for ad&#13;
hoc support to the project activities.&#13;
(iii)  Establishment and maintenance of a data bank. The data bank will include updated&#13;
informnation on market prices, product quality standards, post harvest technologies&#13;
and marketing techniques. All documents and periodicals will be referenced in an&#13;
annotated bibliography, organized by subsectors, to provide readily available&#13;
information services on demand. The network will also issue a bi-monthly bulletin&#13;
on key information in agroprocessing to be published in the local press and, twice a&#13;
year, will prepare media programs on agroprocessing activities.&#13;
(d)   Access to Credit (US$93.000 base costs)Banks and rural financial institutions are&#13;
currently not involved in agroprocessing activities, except for cotton, rice and grain with&#13;
the backstopping of institutions such as CMDT and Office du Niger. A workshop&#13;
conducted at appraisal between agroprocessing entrepreneurs and banks has confirmed&#13;
that Malian bankers are very reluctant to lend to that sector because of their lack of&#13;
knowledge of the activities and the entrepreneurs of this sector. The fourth component&#13;
will then aim at bridging the current gap and developing cooperation between agricultural&#13;
processing and marketing enterprises, and banking and financial institutions, through (i)&#13;
the organization of workshops and meetings between entrepreneurs and banks and&#13;
financial institutions, and (ii) training and study tours on agricultural processing for&#13;
banking and financial sector staff. The workshops, training modules and study tours will&#13;
cover mangoes, green beans, hides and skins and other key subsectors. Banks' staff will be&#13;
the beneficiaries of this training component on a cost-sharing basis (50 percent). The&#13;
training activities will be subcontracted to teams of local and international consultants.&#13;
B. Institutional Arrangements. Implementation. and Operation&#13;
Institutional Set-up&#13;
4.07        The Government's new policy of delegating some of its traditional functions to&#13;
professional organizations, has been demonstrated by recent legislation (Law NO 93-044 of&#13;
August 4, 1993, and Decree N0 93-295 of August 18, 1993) relative to the Regional Chambers of&#13;
Agriculture of Mali and their federated body, the Permanent Assembly of the Chambers of&#13;
Agriculture of Mali (APCAM). The legislation empowers APCAM, and any of the Regional&#13;
Chambers of Agriculture, to create an entity or enterprise to which it can delegate implementation&#13;
responsibilities for all or part of the missions provided for by the law. Signature of an agreement&#13;
between the Government and APROFA, by which the Government delegates to APROFA full&#13;
responsibility for project implementation, would be a condition of effectiveness. Since APCAM is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
not an implementing agency, it will set up a project implementation entity, the "Agricultural&#13;
Trading and Processing Promotion Agency", APROFA by its French acronym, to which it will&#13;
entrust management of the project. Creation of the Agency will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
The Government will exercise overall project supervision through the Ministry of Rural&#13;
Development and Environment. A consultative committee, comprised of representatives of&#13;
Governmental agencies whose activities complement or reinforce the project's interventions and&#13;
of representatives of beneficiaries, will play an advisory role. A provisional steering committee&#13;
has already been operating during project preparation.&#13;
4.08        The Agency will be fully autonomous and will operate along the lines defined by&#13;
the Government/APROFA agreement and according to the rules and procedures defined in the&#13;
Procedures Manual, which have been agreed-to by Government during negotiations.&#13;
4.09        The principles underlying the "Convention" between Government and APROFA&#13;
and those underlying the Procedures Manual of the Agency, the schedule for their preparation by&#13;
a consulting firm, the specific mission of the Consultative Committee, as well as the list of&#13;
institutions to be represented in it, have been discussed and agreed upon with Government and&#13;
APCAM during the appraisal. Government has already submitted drafts of the "Convention", of&#13;
the Procedures Manual, and of the proposed mandate and composition of the Consultative&#13;
Committee. Agreement with IDA on the "Convention", on the Procedures Manual, and on the&#13;
mandate and composition of the Consultative Committee was obtained at negotiations. Signature&#13;
of the "Convention" by Government and APROFA and the establishment of the Agency&#13;
(APROFA) will be conditions of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
Organization&#13;
4.10        The Agency, to be located in Bamako, will have streamlined operating structures,&#13;
and will be responsible for overall management and coordination of project activities, for direct&#13;
oversight of support packages to the specialized professional associations, and for development&#13;
and maintenance of the agricultural processing and marketing exchange network, already started&#13;
during project preparation, that will be made easily accessible to the regional branches and to the&#13;
subsector professional organizations. The Agency will have in full operation three regional&#13;
branches, to be located in Sikasso, Segou and Mopti, which will be responsible for promoting&#13;
high potential agroprocessing activities in the region by providing: (a) polyvalent support to all&#13;
entrepreneurs involved in agroprocessing in the region (b) individualized on-demand support to&#13;
entrepreneurs or groups of entrepreneurs involved in agricultural processing and marketing&#13;
activities; and (c) managerial and organizational support to Regional Chambers of Agriculture.&#13;
Operational Procedures&#13;
4.11        Annual programs and prioritization of activities and beneficiaries. Each year, the&#13;
regional branches of the Agency will prepare a program of activities and corresponding budget&#13;
after consultations with local beneficiaries (workshops using the participatory ZOPP method) and&#13;
the regional Chamber of Agriculture. The agency will also prepare an annual detailed program and&#13;
budget for support to the professional associations. The agency will then consolidate its overall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
program of activities and, budget, to be submitted for comments each year to the consultative&#13;
committee, including APCAM, and to the MDRE. The proposed format for annual program and&#13;
budget is included in the manual of procedures. The Agency will select and prioritize activities&#13;
and beneficiaries to be supported by the project in the context of these main criteria:&#13;
(a)    The key subsector activities and the products supported by the project must: (i)&#13;
represent a significant share of agroprocessing activities at the regional or national&#13;
level, (ii) benefit to a large number of beneficiaries, particularly small holders and&#13;
women in rural and semi-urban areas (large firms will be referred to APEP or&#13;
APDF (para. 3.04), and (iii) have a good potential for impact on growth and&#13;
income generation.&#13;
(b)   The national professional associations to be supported must have been created on&#13;
their own members' initiative, such as AMELEF (fruits and vegetables exports)&#13;
and MPCP (hides and skins exports), and must demonstrate adequate leadership in&#13;
enhancing the performance of the subsector.&#13;
(c)    All entrepreneurs who want to receive support from the project will assume full&#13;
financial risks of their activities promoted by the project, including export and&#13;
marketing tests, as the project will only provide essentially technical assistance and&#13;
training.&#13;
(d)   Private entrepreneurs requesting individual support from the project will have to&#13;
pay the set fee prior to receiving any services from the Agency.&#13;
4.12         Provision of Services. Subcontracting. and Cooperative Agreements. To provide&#13;
the proposed support services, the Agency will rely on the expertise of its own staff and on&#13;
information available from the agricultural trading and processing exchange network, on&#13;
subcontracts to private consultants, to specialized agencies and to NGO's and other institutions,&#13;
and on cooperative agreements with specialized Government services and/or non governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs).  Subcontracts to consultants will be awarded according to Bank's&#13;
Guidelines on use of Consultants, as set forth in the Procedures Manual, and will be based on the&#13;
roster of consultants and resource people and institutions developed and regularly updated within&#13;
the agricultural trading and processing exchange network component.&#13;
4.13         The Agency will set up such umbrella cooperative agreements (Convention Cadre)&#13;
with the national agricultural research institute (Institut d'Economie Rurale or IER) for relevant&#13;
research on priority agroprocessing and post-harvest technologies, with CMDT and Direction&#13;
Regionale Sikasso for extension services to be provided in the Sikasso region, and with the Office&#13;
du Niger and national extension program (PNVA) for provision of extension services in the Segou&#13;
and Mopti regions. Proposals for these agreements have been reviewed during negotiations, and&#13;
the signing of these agreements will be a condition of effectiveness. Activities to be undertaken&#13;
under these umbrella agreements and potential supplementary financing by the project will be&#13;
jointly specified in annual activity programs. Only incremental equipment, materials, and/or&#13;
training directly related to research and extension activities undertaken in connection with this&#13;
project will qualify for financing. Such financing will require IDA's prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
4.14         Relationships with other Services and Institutions. To avoid duplication and insure&#13;
complementarity of efforts, the Agency will refer support seekers to other specialized support&#13;
agencies, projects and programs such as the EEC and Canadian small and medium enterprise&#13;
support funds (PMI/PME), PRMC's food aid programs, CILSS's support program to grain&#13;
processing (PROCELOS), and USAID's APEX decentralized support program to the livestock&#13;
sector. All formal sector agroprocessing enterprises that qualify will be referred to the Private&#13;
Sector Promotion Agency (APEP) for individualized support, and to IFC's APDF/AEF for&#13;
financing requests. CECI, the Canadian NGO specialized in food processing (para. 2.14), will&#13;
participate in this pilot project by funding an agroprocessing technologies specialist to be based in&#13;
the Sikasso regional support unit.&#13;
4.15         The project will not finance agroprocessing investments or operations, but will&#13;
provide limited funding for an increased dialogue between agribusiness and financial institutions.&#13;
Requests for investment finance studies will be referred to BNDA, other banks, and/or to the&#13;
newly created "Credit Initiative", formerly a FED/PME/PMI project. In view of the beneficial&#13;
effects of improved rural infrastructure on agricultural trading and processing activities,&#13;
coordination and complementarity will be pursued with regards to rural roads priority programs&#13;
to be scheduled for implementation under the IDA-financed Transport Sector project.&#13;
4.16         The Private Irrigation Project under preparation would be implemented in close&#13;
coordination with this project, as there is a strong complementarity between the goals and&#13;
activities of the two projects.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.17         Implementation will proceed in phases. During the first two years, only two&#13;
regional branches will be set-up in Sikasso and Segou, which have obvious potential for&#13;
agroprocessing. One support package to AMELEF, the fruit and vegetable exporters professional&#13;
association, has already been defined and another one is being prepared for the "Mutuelle des&#13;
Professionels des Cuirs et Peaux" (MPCP), the hides and skins exporters cooperative. The third&#13;
regional branch, to be located in Mopti, and the support package to a third professional&#13;
association, that of the oilseeds and sheanut producers, will be started after the mid-term review.&#13;
Conditions of disbursement for these is submission to IDA at the midterm review of satisfactory&#13;
proposals. The midterm review will assess the impact and performance of the first phase and&#13;
make recommendations to improve project design and implementation.&#13;
Local Contribution to Project Funding and Cost Recovery&#13;
4.18         The Government will contribute to salaries and operational costs of four high level&#13;
staff to be positioned at APCAM, and at the Regional Chambers of Agriculture in Sikasso, Segou,&#13;
and Mopti. This contribution is estimated at US$400,000, or about 6 percent of total project&#13;
costs. The Government will also be contributing to project implementation through the research&#13;
and extension activities to be carried out in the context of the Cooperative agreements between&#13;
the Agency and IER, PNVA, and CMDT/DRA.&#13;

4.19         The three professional associations will assume full financial responsibility of all&#13;
administrative and logistical costs associated with support activities they receive from the project&#13;
(secretarial support, local travel and per-diem for their members, etc.).&#13;
4.20         Beneficiary entrepreneurs' participation in financing the delivery cost of support&#13;
services is a key factor for ensuring that services provided by the project will match the needs of&#13;
entrepreneurs, and is essential to the sustainability of many of the project's activities beyond the&#13;
life of the project. The Agency will implement a cost recovery scheme that is acceptable to IDA.&#13;
A proposed cost recovery scheme, included in the Procedures Manual, has been reviewed and&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
4.21         The proposed scheme requires, for convenience purposes, that payments be made&#13;
on a flat fee basis, except for feasibility and financing studies which will be charged on a&#13;
percentage basis (2.5 percent of investment amount, as is the current practice with other programs&#13;
and institutions). Payments will be required for:&#13;
(a)    all documentation pertaining to technical, regulatory, financial and market&#13;
information provided to them;&#13;
(b)    participation in project sponsored public events (fairs, competitions);&#13;
(c)    participation in training sessions and workshops;&#13;
(d)    use of project-financed market infrastructure (regional wholesale markets and&#13;
collective handling and cold storage facilities); and&#13;
(e)   all on-demand individualized support services.&#13;
4.22         Cost recovery is estimated at about 20 percent of incremental costs for: (a), (b)&#13;
and (c). Fees for (d) will be collected through lease contracts awarded to private enterprises who&#13;
will insure proper maintenance and management of the facilities and collect user fees according to&#13;
an agreed-to fee schedule. Contributions from (e) are expected to cover 50 percent of the&#13;
incremental cost of services provided directly by the Agency's staff, and 100 percent of the cost&#13;
of services subcontracted to outside consultants. Total beneficiaries' contributions are estimated&#13;
at about US$400,000, or about 6 percent of total project costs.&#13;
4.23         The adequacy of the local funding arrangements, and of beneficiaries' cost&#13;
recovery scheme will be evaluated at the midterm review.&#13;
C. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
Progress of Project Preparation&#13;
4.24         Project design was based on the white cover sector report completed in June 1993,&#13;
which analyzed the potential for, and constraints to, the development of agricultural processing&#13;
and trading in Mali. Preparation was carried out by a local inter-ministerial working group with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -&#13;
the help of a local consulting firm, which has been appointed to monitor all local preparation&#13;
activities, relying on strong participation from the private sector. Preparation started in 1993 with&#13;
ZOPP participatory workshops involving potential private sector beneficiaries in July (Bamako)&#13;
and September (Sikasso) to discuss the conclusions of the sector report and identify services to be&#13;
provided by the project. It then continued with the following activities: (a) assistance from the&#13;
Austrian Consultant Trust Fund in the design of a development program for the horticultural&#13;
sector, with the implementation of small trial export operation, (b) workshops in July 1994 with&#13;
AMELEF and MDRE to establish their export promotion strategy and action plan (AMELEF&#13;
participated in regional workshops with COLEACP in June, September and October 1994 to&#13;
coordinate the upcoming green bean campaign with exporters from neighboring countries, and to&#13;
negotiate the transport and export program with Air Afrique and European importers); (c) design&#13;
and set-up, also on a trial basis, of a small informal unit to promote private initiatives in&#13;
agroprocessing through the provision of contacts, information, and flexible and multidisciplinary&#13;
technical assistance (the design of this unit was proposed by the Sikasso workshop and it was&#13;
launched in July 1994); (d) workshops between banks, national agricultural services and&#13;
AMELEF conducted in November 1994, and (e) specific studies. An FAO-CP team joined the&#13;
Bank team for a preparation mission in October 1993 and another mission was conducted by a&#13;
Bank team in April 1994. Appraisal was carried out in November 1994.&#13;
Lessons from Project Preparation Activities&#13;
4.25         An export test for about 17 tons of mangoes, run with AMELEF participation and&#13;
support from Freshconsult, demonstrated that mango exports by sea routes are feasible and less&#13;
costly than air freight. During this test, Malian entrepreneurs demonstrated that they can, with the&#13;
right support, master the whole chain of post-harvest technologies and operations from&#13;
harvesting, to packaging, to refrigerated land and sea transport, all the way to the delivery of a&#13;
good-quality production for auction to European distributors. The test not only revealed the&#13;
weaknesses at each step of the chain, but also presented many tangible improvements that can be&#13;
introduced in the short term and the long term.&#13;
4.26         Under the leadership of the Malian preparation coordinator, a team  of two&#13;
consultants has set up in August 1994 a regional unit in Sikasso, a high potential area for fruits,&#13;
vegetables, and oilseeds, for a test program of support to regional agroprocessing activities. The&#13;
experience which is to be continued up to project effectiveness, has been very successful so far.&#13;
First, it is proving how powerful and satisfactory the "tutorship" role of the Chamber of&#13;
Agriculture could be in the field, at least at the regional level. Second, it shows how responsive&#13;
and committed beneficiaries are to a pragmatic approach to goal setting and problem solving&#13;
linked to their interests. The unit, in constant contact with potential beneficiaries, has identified its&#13;
best comparative advantage this year in the role. of catalyst and facilitator for an ambitious potato&#13;
and mango export project initiated by private entrepreneurs. In doing so, the unit is seen by all&#13;
beneficiaries involved as playing a unique role by bringing together at the local level the local&#13;
producers, the bankers, the national agricultural and research services, transporters, exporters,&#13;
etc., around one common purpose focused on an export campaign.&#13;
4.27         Each of these two tests revealed the need to promote and maintain a continuous&#13;
dialogue with all stakeholders based on a common purpose between private exporters/producers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
national support services and financial institutions. Following numerous regional and national&#13;
level workshops and meetings initiated during preparation, concrete results have already been&#13;
achieved. In Sikasso, the BNDA local branch has agreed to finance a test campaign, and&#13;
Agriculture and CMDT agents are contributing strongly to the test. In Bamako, the bankers, the&#13;
PNVA extension services and the exporters are currently negotiating a first "test" agreement for&#13;
the upcoming export season of green beans and mangoes. The difficulties and successes&#13;
experienced during these tests have helped the Malian preparation team tremendously to prioritize&#13;
and redesign the objectives and actions of the proposed pilot project. This "learning by doing"&#13;
approach with beneficiaries, supported through a continuous client consultation process of ZOPP&#13;
workshop, will continue to be one of the basic principles throughout the implementation of this&#13;
project.&#13;
4.28         Activities up to effectiveness will be:&#13;
(a)   an export test to be completed by July 1995, on the basis of a study of the hides&#13;
and skins subsector done in November 1994;&#13;
(b)   a study of the sheanuts/exotic products subsector, along with statistical and&#13;
competitiveness analysis, and an environmental impact evaluation;&#13;
(c)   preparation of the set-up of the decentralized unit in Segou, following&#13;
recommendations of a workshop conducted in Segou in October 1994;&#13;
(d)   a review  of the capacity-building needs of professional organizations and&#13;
Chambers of Agriculture to be involved in the project;&#13;
(e)   the ongoing operation of the test Regional Support Unit in Sikasso;&#13;
(f)   an assessment of the availability of rural credit for agroprocessing, particularly in&#13;
the first two regions to benefit from project activities;&#13;
(g)   market studies in neighboring countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Senegal) to&#13;
identify potential demand for Malian products; and&#13;
(h)   another workshop between banks, AMELEF and National Agricultural Services to&#13;
prepare the 1995 export campaign (mangoes and green beans).&#13;
D. Proiect Costs and Financing&#13;
4.29         Total project costs, net of taxes and import duties but including price and physical&#13;
contingencies and the refinancing of advances from the IDA PPF, are estimated at US$6.9 million&#13;
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$2.8 million. Base costs are estimated at&#13;
US$5.9 million at January 1995 prices. Price contingencies represent 11 percent of base costs&#13;
and assume domestic inflation of 5 percent in 1995, and 3 percent thereafter, and foreign inflation&#13;
of 2.5 percent. Physical contingencies represent 4 percent of base costs. Total costs do not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
include investments to be paid for by private entrepreneurs through self-financing and/or via&#13;
credit. Given the emphasis on technical assistance and transfer of know-how in this project, staff&#13;
(operating costs) and consultants' services represent the most important expenditures. The IDA&#13;
credit of US$6 million equivalent will finance 87 percent of total project costs, including all&#13;
foreign costs. Government and beneficiaries' contributions are estimated at 12 percent of project&#13;
costs. CECI, the Canadian NGO will participate as a start with I percent of project cost by&#13;
financing one agroprocessing specialist in Sikasso, but their contribution is likely to expand during&#13;
the implementation of the project. The beneficiaries' contribution, amounting to 6 percent on&#13;
average, will increase over the lifetime of the project through steady increases in fees charged for&#13;
individual support services, and through user fees charged on use of collective facilities and&#13;
equipment procured through the project. Direct Government contributions will amount to 6&#13;
percent with financing of the incremental staff and operating costs of Chambers of Agriculture&#13;
and APCAM in the context of the project. The Government will also contribute to the project&#13;
with the provision of publicly funded incremental extension and research services, under a&#13;
cooperative agreement with the project.&#13;
4.30            The  detailed  financing  plan  was finalized  at negotiations.    Allocation  of&#13;
Government and beneficiary contributions, and the disbursement mechanisms, were agreed upon&#13;
at negotiations.   Total project cost and financing  estimates are detailed in Annex  I and&#13;
summarized below. Preparation was funded by a Japanese Grant Facility, and an Austrian Trust&#13;
Fund. Further financing from a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to cover preparation costs up to&#13;
the effectiveness date has been approved.&#13;

E. On-lending and Administration of Funds&#13;
4.31            Proceeds of the IDA  credit would be passed on by Government to the project&#13;
implementing agency in grant form. This measure would be included in the Contractual&#13;
Agreement between the Government and APROFA whereby the Agency (APROFA) would be&#13;
entrusted with project management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
F. Procurement and Use of Consultants&#13;
4.32        The Agency, to be created before effectiveness, would be responsible for&#13;
procurement arrangements. Procurement of civil works would be delegated to AGETIPE or&#13;
other qualified specialists who would be responsible for the preparation of specifications,&#13;
evaluation of bids and supervision of construction. Procurement of civil works contracts,&#13;
comprising of the building of wholesale markets in two regions, and of rehabilitation works for&#13;
cold storage in Bamako, will be less than US$200,000 and would be unsuitable for ICB as foreign&#13;
firms will not be interested. Procurement of goods, comprising of vehicles and office equipment&#13;
and supplies, will also be small, and each contract below US$150,000. Procurement will be by&#13;
NCB and foreign firms, if interested, will be allowed to paiticipate. Shopping should be used for&#13;
contracts below US$ 30,000 each, aggregating to no more than US$ 100,000 for vehicles and&#13;
US$ 40,000 for equipment. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that all procurement to be&#13;
carried out by the Agency would be in accordance with the Revised (1/95) Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement for Goods and Works. The Agency management may hire a consultant familiar with&#13;
IDA procurement and disbursement procedures to carry out procurement of goods. The project&#13;
launch workshop scheduled for October 1995 will also provide procurement guidance to project&#13;
staff.&#13;
4.33        Consultant services under the proposed project will serve to provide: (a) direct&#13;
services to the Agency's operations, i.e. setting up the accounting system and procedures and&#13;
undertaking the internal audits (TORs included in Procedures Manual), and (b) technical support&#13;
to project beneficiaries such as preparation of feasibility studies, market surveys, export test runs,&#13;
etc. Most of these services are for short -term period. All consultant services would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Bank's standard forms for&#13;
contracts will be used.&#13;
4.34        Bank prior review procedures will be followed with respect to contracts for goods&#13;
and works in excess of US$100,000, to all consultant contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or&#13;
more for selection of a consulting firm, and at US$50,000 or more for individual consultants.&#13;
Other contracts would be reviewed by the Bank ex-post on a sample basis (1 in 5) during project&#13;
supervision. Planned procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 2.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.35        The IDA Credit would be disbursed over a five-year period from the date of Credit&#13;
effectiveness. This deviates from the standard disbursement profile for Government-managed&#13;
agricultural projects in Mali because project management will be entrusted to an autonomous&#13;
agency which is expected to have faster disbursement rates than those possible under central&#13;
administration procedures. All disbursement activities under this project will be managed by the&#13;
Agency. The closing date of the credit would be March 31, 2001, or six months after project&#13;
completion/termination. The expected schedule of disbursements is summarized in Table 3.&#13;

4.36          Disbursements of the IDA Credit will be fully documented, except for payments&#13;
against contracts of less than US$100,000, which would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at the&#13;
Agency for review by IDA staff during supervision missions and for annual audits. In order to&#13;
facilitate disbursements, the Agency would establish, in a bank acceptable to IDA, a Special&#13;
Account into which IDA would, upon credit effectiveness, deposit an advance in CFAF of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
equivalent of US$500,000 for the management agency to cover IDA's share of eligible&#13;
expenditures. IDA would replenish the Special Account upon satisfactory proof of incurred&#13;
eligible expenditures.  Replenishment requests would be accompanied by up-to-date bank&#13;
statements and reconciliation of the Special Account. Disbursement categories, credit amount and&#13;
the share of expenditures to be financed by IDA are shown in Table 4 below.&#13;
4.37         In order to ensure that the agency does not subcontract feasibility studies or other&#13;
support to private entrepreneurs without adequate financing, the counterpart contribution from&#13;
the beneficiaries is required prior to subcontracting and provision of services. Moreover, to&#13;
ensure that IDA does not disburse all of its contribution without corresponding action by&#13;
Government/beneficiaries, agreement will be reached that will permit IDA to delay the approval at&#13;
the end of each year when the new activities program and budget are transmitted to IDA, should&#13;
the Government/beneficiaries have failed to make their contribution and the Agency failed to&#13;
enforce its manual of procedures.&#13;

V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Organization&#13;
5.01         The Government will sign an agreement, or "Convention", by which it delegates&#13;
to APROFA full responsibility for project implementation. APROFA will set up the implementing&#13;
Agency, and delegate to it full authority for project management and implementation. The&#13;
Government will exercise overall project supervision through the Ministry of Rural Development&#13;
and Environment (MDRE).   A  consultative committee, comprised of representatives of&#13;
Governmental agencies whose activities complement or reinforce the project's interventions and&#13;
of representatives of beneficiaries, will play a strictly advisory role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
B. Manaeement and Coordination&#13;
5.02        The Agency (APROFA) will have full autonomy in managing the project. Its&#13;
headquarters will be staffed by a General Manager, an accountant/financial manager, a monitoring&#13;
and evaluation specialist, and a communications specialist to be in charge of the exchange&#13;
network and data bank. The regional branches will be staffed by an agroprocessing technology&#13;
specialist, an agricultural economist familiar with techniques of project appraisal and financial&#13;
analysis, and by a senior agricultural economist experienced in agricultural processing and&#13;
marketing issues, who will be responsible for the unit's management. The necessary support&#13;
personnel, as detailed in the cost tables, will also be financed by the project. Job descriptions for&#13;
all senior personnel have been prepared prior to negotiations and finalized during negotiations.&#13;
5.03        The Agency General Manager will be responsible for the preparation and&#13;
supervision of the support packages to the Agency Regional Branches and to the selected&#13;
professional associations, and will specifically insure:&#13;
(a)   the dissemination of information on the project's mandate and modes of&#13;
intervention (IEC campaign, with radio and other media);&#13;
(b)   the coordination and overseeing of project implementation;&#13;
(c)   the access of external auditors to the necessary information for the audit of project&#13;
accounts;&#13;
(d)   the recruitment of the personnel necessary for project implementation, including&#13;
consultants;&#13;
(e)   the coordination of project activities to be implemented by and with other&#13;
institutions such as PNVA and IER; and&#13;
(f)   the maintenance of relations with Government ministries and technical agencies,&#13;
NGOs, other parties involved in private sector promotion activities, including&#13;
APEP and AMADIP, and other donor initiatives.&#13;
5.04        The General Manager, with qualifications acceptable to IDA, has been selected by&#13;
a joint committee composed of Government and APCAM representatives, and participated in the&#13;
negotiations. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that the performance of the General&#13;
Manager must at all times be acceptable to IDA, and that any change of the General Manager&#13;
would be discussed and agreed with IDA.&#13;
C. Proerammine and Budgeting Procedures&#13;
5.05        The Agency, through its regional branches and in coordination with professional&#13;
associations will prepare annual budgets for each project component, supported by an activities&#13;
program. The Agency will then submit, by August of each year, a consolidated Agency-wide&#13;
annual budget and work plan for review to the consultation committee, including APCAM, and to&#13;
MDRE, and IDA. The revised budget and program will be executed, unless objected to by IDA,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
MDRE, and/or the Ministry of Finance within thirty (30) days of reception of the revised version.&#13;
Each regional branch will execute its annual program with funds transferred to its regional&#13;
account by the Agency. No budget will be transferred to the professional associations, and&#13;
disbursements of such expenditures will be made directly by the Agency.&#13;
D. Reporting. Monitoring, Suvervision, and Evaluation&#13;
5.06     Monitoring and evaluation will focus on: (a) the effectiveness of services provided to&#13;
private entrepreneurs, either by the Agency or by other institutions; and (b) the extent to which&#13;
the project has improved the technical and management performance of agroprocessing&#13;
entrepreneurs and that of their professional organizations, and (c) the project's impact on&#13;
agricultural processing activities and entrepreneurs. The Agency would be responsible for project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, this task being the responsibility of the General Manager and the&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation specialist, and IDA and MDRE will be responsible for ensuring proper&#13;
project supervision.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
5.07        The regional branches, the professional associations receiving support, and the&#13;
Agency would submit semi-annual progress reports. Based on these reports, and on regular visits&#13;
by the monitoring and evaluation specialist, the General Manager would prepare a semi-annual&#13;
consolidated progress report to be submitted to IDA, MDRE, and the Consultative Committee.&#13;
APCAM, IDA and MDRE will meet at least twice a year to discuss the semi-annual progress&#13;
reports and the annual evaluation reports, and to exchange views on project progress and on the&#13;
Agency's management and compliance with its operating procedures set forth in the "Convention"&#13;
and in the Agency's Procedures Manual. In order to facilitate monitoring, a detailed outline of&#13;
the semi-annual reports including specific performance indicators, has been agreed upon with&#13;
Government during negotiations.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
5.08        To ensure proper technical audits by IDA  and Government of project&#13;
implementation, a consulting firm will be selected to collect and analyze, on a yearly basis, data on&#13;
performance indicators and to assess progress in relation to project objectives and identify serious&#13;
implementation problems. Terms of reference for such technical audits, and the performance&#13;
indicators to be used have been agreed upon with Government at negotiations.&#13;
5.09        Performance of the project will be assessed according to the following&#13;
performance indicators:&#13;

Project Review and Impact Evaluation&#13;
5.10           At negotiations, the  project evaluation  system  has been  agreed  to  with&#13;
Government. This system will include a mid-term review and a project completion review. The&#13;
mid-term review will be carried out jointly by Government and IDA at the end of Year 2. This&#13;
review will aim at verifying the continued validity of the design assumptions in the light of&#13;
implementation experience, particularly in relation to cost recovery schemes, and assess whether&#13;
adjustments in the design or other aspects of the project are called for. This review will also&#13;
determine the extent to which the project has achieved its anticipated development impact, and&#13;
would address the issue of expanding project activities to the Mopti region and/or to a third&#13;
professional association, that of the Sheanut/exotic products subsector. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained from Government at negotiations that: (a) a specific period would be designated to carry&#13;
out the mid-term review; (b) Government will submit to IDA, not later than four weeks prior to&#13;
the mid-term review, a report by consultants evaluating project activities; and (c) soon after the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
mid-term review, the recommendations would be implemented in accordance with an agreed&#13;
action plan. As a support to the review process, a baseline beneficiary survey will be conducted&#13;
prior to project start-up, and two beneficiary response surveys will be completed at mid term and&#13;
at the end of the project to analyze its impact. All surveys will be entrusted to an independent&#13;
consulting firm.&#13;
E. Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Monitorin!&#13;
5.11        The General Manager of the Agency has overall responsibility for project&#13;
accounting, auditing and reporting. He/she would submit to IDA: (a) semi-annual financial&#13;
statements on project expenditures; (b) annual work programs and budgets for the following year;&#13;
and (c) an Implementation Project Report (ICR) within six months of the Credit's closing date.&#13;
The project's accounting management, including the establishment of an accounting system,&#13;
would be carried out by a senior accountant with periodic assistance from a consulting firm. The&#13;
terms of reference for the consulting firm to be recruited were drafted during appraisal. The&#13;
establishment of the project's accounting system would be a condition of effectiveness. Project&#13;
accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited semiannually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. All disbursements under SOEs would be audited twice a year. The semi-&#13;
annual audit reports, including the management letter and proposed internal control&#13;
improvements, as well as semi-annual audit reports on SOEs, have been submitted to IDA within&#13;
three months of the end of each audit period. Assurances to this effect have been obtained from&#13;
Government during negotiations. Agreement between Government and IDA on these terms of&#13;
reference for the audits, the short-list of firms, selection procedures, as well as on the issuance by&#13;
Government of the letter of invitation to the short-listed firms to submit proposals, were a&#13;
condition of negotiations. The contract award for the audit of project accounts would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
VI. BENEFITS. RISKS, SUSTAINABILITY. AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
A. Proiect Benefits&#13;
6.01        Main project benefits would be higher growth rates in the agricultural trading and&#13;
agroprocessing sector, thus contributing to greater economic diversification and increased urban&#13;
and rural employment. This would be achieved by the project laying the groundwork for a strong&#13;
supply response to the CFAF devaluation through the provision of: (a) increased access&#13;
opportunities to local and regional markets, (b) increased exports, especially those of high value&#13;
products, and increased substitution for imported products; (c) improved capabilities of the&#13;
Regional Chambers of Agriculture and of subsector professional organizations to provide&#13;
demand-driven support services to private entrepreneurs. The project would also reduce the&#13;
incidence of poverty and enhance women's participation in and benefits from development, as&#13;
most of the project's potential beneficiaries would be small entrepreneurs, many of them women,&#13;
already involved in agricultural processing and trading activities and who seek to upgrade their&#13;
technical and managerial efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
6.02         The project's main risks are: a) its linkages to Regional Chambers of Agriculture&#13;
and professional associations which are still rather weak and inexperienced, b) poor management&#13;
and misuse by the Agency of its autonomy in project implementation, and c) the abandonment by&#13;
Government of its present policy of support to the private sector. Precautions taken to minimnize&#13;
these risks include provisions for: (a) high selectivity in choosing Regional Chambers of&#13;
Agriculture and professional associations participating in implementation (b) no direct control of&#13;
funds by APCAM, Regional Chambers of Agriculture and/or professional associations&#13;
participating in project activities, (c) stringent management rules and procedures, especially with&#13;
regard to sub-contracting procedures, similar to those already used successfully in the&#13;
"AGETIPE" projects in the region, (d) strong monitoring of management performance, intensive&#13;
technical supervision, and regular evaluation of beneficiaries' response, and e) progressive&#13;
implementation, the second phase being built upon results of the first phase. The risk of a reversal&#13;
by Government of its current private sector support policies is rather slim in view of the growing&#13;
constituencies for these policies in Mali, and in view of the Bank/IMF dialogue with Government,&#13;
supported by the PFP, CAS, and Bank portfolio&#13;
C. Sustainability&#13;
6.03         The project is conceived as a research and development (R&amp;D) and capacity&#13;
building investment which should lead the local institutions representing the private sector to be&#13;
strong and professional enough to select, manage and finance the services essential to private&#13;
entrepreneurs. This will be achieved by: (a) gradually reducing the needs for technical assistance&#13;
and other services through know-how transfer and capacity building during five years to the&#13;
benefit of leading professional associations, Chambers of Agriculture, and local producers&#13;
organizations, and (b) learning through trials the most effective services and techniques and&#13;
helping the same institutions to design and implement a cost recovery scheme. Long-term needs&#13;
for these services will be monitored during the project. The long-term sustainability of the&#13;
services will be measured by thie capacity of the Chambers of Agriculture and the professional&#13;
organizations to take over the provision of these services, reducing the need for an autonomous&#13;
agency financed from external sources&#13;
D. Environmental Impact&#13;
6.04         The project falls within environmental category C. The project will not finance&#13;
agro-industnres, but will focus on providing TA to small and medium agroprocessing activities&#13;
scattered in at least five regions.  Although no negative environmental impact is likely,&#13;
environmental concerns will be addressed during project implementation as they arise, and during&#13;
the mid-term review. The potential environmental impact of activities to be supported in the&#13;
second phase in the hides and skins subsector will be evaluated in the context of the subsector&#13;
study planned during the first phase.&#13;
&#13;

integrer au bout de cinq ans dans une structure unique d'appui aux entreprises agricoles privees. Pour&#13;
ce faire, il serait opportun d'ores et deja de prendre les dispositions ci-apres:&#13;
a.    identifier les procedures permettant aux deux projets de combiner et integrer leurs&#13;
appuis aux beneficiaires qui le demandent au niveau national et dans la mesure du&#13;
possible dans les zones d'implantation respectives de la premiere phase (Koulikoro et&#13;
Sikasso);&#13;
b.     envisager les options d'integration des deux  agences d'appui au terme des deux&#13;
projets.&#13;
D. Contributions des b6n6ficiaires aux couits des appuis fournis:&#13;
La perennit6 des actions d'appuis qui sont adaptees aux besoins des beneficiaires est liMe a la capacite&#13;
de ces derniers a les prendre en charge une fois le projet fini. I1 est donc crucial que le principe et la&#13;
capacit6 de contribution au financement des actions d'appui soient etablis des le demarrage du projet. II&#13;
est propose a cet effet que:&#13;
i.     meme s'il est admis que les appuis polvvalents a caractere de service public&#13;
soient subventionnes en grande partie, certaines interventions pourraient faire&#13;
l'objet dune participation des beneficiaires (exemples: location de stands&#13;
d'exposition dans les foires, vente de guides sur la fiscalite, le financement, etc).&#13;
Hi.    le cout de la contribution a la charge du ben6ficiaire est fonction du type&#13;
d'appui specifique demande; la contribution y afferente doit etre recuper6e&#13;
(exemples : tarifs forfaitaires pour la realisation d'une etude de faisabilite&#13;
technique, la recherche d'un partenaire commercial, I'appui au lancement dune&#13;
entreprise, ou le suivi de la mise en place d'un projet/programme).&#13;
fii.    les associations professionnelles et chambres regionales d'agriculture prennent&#13;
progressivement a leur compte le cout de fonctionnement de tout service&#13;
d'appui qu'elles souhaitent fournir elles-memes, cette prise en charge&#13;
progressive devra intervenir au moins des la deuxieme phase du projet (suivi a&#13;
I'evaluation a mi-parcours).&#13;

            primarily on capacity-building and on the transfer of
            know-how to the private sector through information networks,
            training, specialized technical assistance, and study tours.
            The project will pursue a two pronged approach: (a)
            provision of generic support in three regions to all
            profitable agroprocessing private entrepreneurs, upstream
            and downstream of agricultural production, and (b) transfer
            of specialized expertise to enterprises operating in
            subsectors or product lines with a high potential for
            international export which require high-quality standards,
            such as fresh and dried fruits and vegetables, hides and
            skins, and shea nuts and other exotic products. Project
            management will be entrusted to an "Agricultural
            Trading and Processing Promotion Agency". The
            Government will exercise overall project supervision through
            the Ministry of Rural Development and Environment. The
            Agency will have streamlined operating structures,
            comprising a coordinating unit located in Bamako, and, in
            full operation, three regional support units. The project
            will provide funding for: (i) the operating of the
            Agency's three regional branches in the Sikasso, Segou,
            and Mopti regions; (ii) support packages, including
            specialized technical assistance, training, studies and
            investment funds for three professional organizations
            promoting vertical integration for the fruit/vegetable,
            hide/skins, and oilseeds/shea nut subsectors; (iii) the
            Agency's operations and management, and the
            establishment and operation of an agricultural processing
            and marketing information exchange network; and (iv)
            activities aimed at facilitating entrepreneurs' access
            to investment financing and credit.
