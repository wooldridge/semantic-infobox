ï»¿3. RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
BOX 1: Government support for the creation of financial cooperative networks&#13;
Financial cooperatives have adopted different integrative models around the world with the goal of&#13;
achieving economies of scale that will support viability while offering a wide range of services to cus-&#13;
tomers. Adopted structures range from the atomized-competitive network model to the feder-&#13;
ated network model. In the first model, integration is largely limited to shared publicity, lobbying,&#13;
and representation. Resources are sometimes shared but without centralization. In the federated net-&#13;
work model, resources and decisions are centralized, and the customer sees the network as a single&#13;
entity. The federated network model of organization offers greater advantages to its members than&#13;
the atomized-competitive model, and most federated financial cooperative networks outperform at-&#13;
omized-competitive networks in terms of stability, financial efficiency, and market penetration (DID&#13;
2005). In fact, Rabobank and Desjardins-both federated networks-not only outperform atom-&#13;
ized-competitive networks but also commercial banks.&#13;
In the federated model, the cooperatives share resources and access to support (back office) ser-&#13;
vices provided by a second-tier institution (the federation) which is owned by them. Integration into&#13;
a network also facilitates standardization of operational systems (such as accounting and data pro-&#13;
cessing), policies and norms, products, and the institutional image. Standardization contributes to&#13;
better performance by promoting comparison among base units. In a federated network, contractual&#13;
solidarity binds members on issues such as the regional area of operation, member size, dues, group&#13;
borrowing, and cross guarantees. The most integrated networks such as Rabobank appear to be a uni-&#13;
fied institution.&#13;
Federated networks strengthen governance of their members through internal regulations and&#13;
strategies. Network structure is characterized by democratic representation and centralized authority&#13;
by an apex organization whose roles and responsibilities complement those of the base units. The&#13;
federation has a surveillance function over its members, and there are established mechanisms for af-&#13;
filiation and disaffiliation. The federation trains, supervises, advises, develops products, and ensures&#13;
monitoring of the base units. Finally, a federated network of cooperatives often has shared ownership&#13;

BOX 1: Government support for the creation of financial cooperative networks (continued)&#13;
in a central agency, a security fund, an insurance firm, or a brokerage that generate products, services,&#13;
or other inputs which are delivered to members at the base level.&#13;
Governments in many countries have actively supported the formation of cooperative networks to&#13;
foster financial stability and/or maintain financial inclusion in remote areas typically served by small&#13;
rural providers. In many cases, governments have raised minimum capital requirements for coopera-&#13;
tives to force mergers in the sector with a view to reach scale. They have also introduced differentiated&#13;
capital requirements for cooperatives in a federated network. For example, in Brazil, the minimum&#13;
capital requirement for cooperatives is 13 percent, compared to 11 percent for cooperatives in a fed-&#13;
erated network. Examples of financial cooperative networks created by governments and multilateral&#13;
donors include the following.&#13;
Albania. In the late 1990s, Albanian authorities, through a World Bank loan, supported the creation,&#13;
training, and monitoring of 92 operationally sustainable financial cooperatives and their organization&#13;
into a network. They also created a second-tier institution owned by the cooperatives-the Albanian&#13;
Union of Savings and Credit Associations-to provide services to the network, and developed net-&#13;
work procedures, governance arrangements, and methodologies. The union's main functions were to&#13;
train its members, provide funding, and collect and monitor data on behalf of the official supervisor.&#13;
Austria. In the 1890s, the Austrian government took measures to support the creation of a three-tier&#13;
cooperative network, Raiffeisen Zentralbank.&#13;
Moldova. A World Bank loan financed the creation of rural financial cooperatives and a federation of&#13;
such cooperatives in Moldova in the early 2000s.&#13;

BOX 2: Privatizing agricultural development banks: the case of Banrural, Guatemala&#13;
Banrural S.A. was created in 1998 with the restructuring of the Guatemalan National Agricultural De-&#13;
velopment Bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agricola, Bandesa), a state-owned bank with extensive&#13;
presence in rural areas and 86 percent of its loan portfolio in the agricultural sector. The transforma-&#13;
tion from Bandesa to Banrural was part of the modernization process of the Guatemalan state and fi-&#13;
nancial system approved by the Guatemalan Congress in 1997 (Alfaro-Gramajo 2003).&#13;
Banrural was established as a joint public-private venture, with 30 percent of its capital provided by&#13;
the state and 70 percent by the private sector (Alfaro and Alfaro 2010). Its ownership structure was&#13;
designed to facilitate the active participation of civil society groups involved in the rural sector and&#13;
with a strong social commitment. Its private shareholders include community groups, cooperatives,&#13;
and organizations. The bank focuses on providing a wide range of financial services that facilitate pro-&#13;
ductive social, investment, and consumer activities in rural areas, as well as servicing social sectors not&#13;
traditionally served by the financial system (for example, indigenous groups).&#13;
Banrural seeks to foster economic activity in rural areas of the country in a way that is profitable and&#13;
sustainable for its shareholders, while maintaining a development objective with an entrepreneurial&#13;
vision. Today it is Guatemala's most profitable bank, and its second largest bank in terms of assets,&#13;
valued at US$5.9 billion at the end of 2014 (Superintendencia de Bancos de Guatemala 2015). The&#13;
bank relies on an extensive network of agents and has over 900 offices serving more than 5.7 million&#13;
customers around the country; it has recently expanded to Honduras (Banrural webste).&#13;
Banrural offers a diverse array of products, including microenterprise credit, corporate credit, sec-&#13;
ond-tier lending, and international operations, as well as a number of payment services (water, elec-&#13;
tricity, telephone). First-tier lending is provided by a specialized microfinance unit, which lends through&#13;
different methodologies including individual loans, solidarity groups, and communal banks. Other&#13;
loan products are designed for small and medium-size farmers, consumer needs, and housing renova-&#13;
tions and expansions.&#13;

BOX 3: Land transfer and title insurance&#13;
Where uncertainty exists over land title due to fraud or error, a legal system can protect either the cur-&#13;
rent (innocent) owner or a previous owner who claims the title. The U.S. system generally awards title&#13;
to the latter in the event of a legitimate claim. Thus, current owners frequently purchase title insurance&#13;
to provide indemnification in the event of a loss.&#13;
Alternatively, a title system could be structured such that, in the event of a claim, the current owner&#13;
retains title to the landa and the claimant is indemnified. The Torrens system, which has been used in&#13;
some U.S. states including Massachusetts and Minnesota, is an example of such a system. Under the&#13;
Torrens system, current owners register their property with the government, at which time an exam-&#13;
ination of the title is conducted. If no claims are made, title is declared to reside with the owner against&#13;
all future claims, and a public fund is established from registration fees to be used to compensate le-&#13;
gitimate claimants who subsequently appear.&#13;
Miceli and Sirmans (1995) maintain that if land transaction costs are lowv both systems are equally ef-&#13;
ficient; but if they are high due to high notary fees and taxes the Torrens system is more efficient as it&#13;
allocates land to who values it more.&#13;
Several U.S. states have experimented with the Torrens or other title registration systems at one time&#13;
or another but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers. Llewellyn&#13;
(2008) notes that one Torrens title on a lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable&#13;
for large-scale improvement, as no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York&#13;
title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title.&#13;

            Expanding opportunities for rural finance
            in Colombia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this note is to provide
            policy recommendations to improve access to credit of rural
            populations and small agricultural producers under
            financially sustainable schemes. Although the agricultural
            sector remains an important source of employment,
            agricultural credit is a small fraction of commercial credit
            in Colombia. The share of agricultural credit in Colombia is
            below levels observed in other countries in the region.
            Colombian commercial banks have limited credit volume in
            rural areas, concentrating their lending activities on more
            profitable urban populations. General deposit warehouses and
            the agricultural commodity exchange (Bolsa Mercantil de
            Colombia (BMC)) provide funding for agricultural activities,
            but they are underdeveloped compared to regional peers and
            serve medium and large size producers. Overall use of
            mobile- and internet-based payment financial products
            remains low in rural Colombia. According to 2014 Findex
            survey data, just two percent of adults report using mobile
            banking, defined as a mobile platform for making
            transactions from an account at a financial institution.
            Public credit guarantee system (FAG) coverage should be
            modified to incentive the use of mobile guarantees and
            agricultural insurance. This will ensure that financial
            institutions have only covered tail risks, providing
            incentives to use mobile guarantees.
