ECUADOR&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Section A.      Background&#13;
1     Environmental Problems and Management Issues. The National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (NEAP) which was prepared in 1994 identified Ecuador's major&#13;
environmental problems and the priority geographic areas for environmental investment .&#13;
A comprehensive list of these areas is contained in Box 1.&#13;
BOX 1. Ecuador's Environmental Problems and Priority Geographic Areas&#13;
Major Environmental Problems&#13;
-- soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and genetic resources, deforestation, water and air&#13;
pollution, environment related health hazards, desertification, watershed destruction and&#13;
floods and other natural disasters--&#13;
Priority Geographic Areas&#13;
-- the coastal forests of the Northwest, coastal mangroves, the Amazon forests, the&#13;
Galapagos, the Gulf of Guayaquil, large and medium sized cities, and major agricultural&#13;
production zones--&#13;
The NEAP also identifies the most important production activities which have a major&#13;
impact on the environment. These include: (i) hydrocarbon exploration, production,&#13;
transport and refining; (ii) minerals production ; (iii) fishing and aquaculture; (iv) intensive&#13;
agriculture and agroindustry; (v) industry (both large scale and cottage); and (vi)&#13;
transport and urbanization. The impact of these activities are for the most part&#13;
concentrated in priority geographic areas such as the Amazon and the coastal zone area of&#13;
the Gulf of Guayaquil and in areas with growing population and industrial development&#13;
such as the major urban centers of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca.&#13;
2.    In addition to identifying major environmental problems and priority geographic&#13;
areas the NEAP also proposes a process and a strategy for improved and more effective&#13;
environmental management. A key element in the process and a central component of the&#13;
strategy is the approval of the new Environmental Law and the establishment of the&#13;
National Environmental Management Council (CONAGA). While the successful passage&#13;
of the law by the Ecuadorian Congress is an indispensable element for establishing the&#13;
groundwork for environmental management, the corresponding programmatic actions&#13;
which make up the strategy will ultimately determine the course for effective&#13;
environmental management. The NEAP identifies a number of programmatic actions&#13;
including :the harmonization of existing laws and decrees which impact the environment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the definition and implementation of an agile institutional framework, the strengthening of&#13;
key institutions charged with the responsibility for environmental management, and the&#13;
provision of resources and the delegation of appropriate responsibilities to municipal and&#13;
local governments, community organizations and NGOs.&#13;
3.    Currently, the Environmental Advisory Commission (CAAM) which was&#13;
established in 1993 by Presidential decree and reports directly to the President is charged&#13;
with carrying forward this process and to ultimately recommending a suitable and&#13;
appropriate institutional framework for environmental management. An important element&#13;
of their work is promoting the new environmental law (see Para. 7). The CAAM is&#13;
composed of representatives of government ministries or agencies whose policies and&#13;
programs directly impact the use of natural resources or have under the current legal&#13;
framework responsibility for water and air quality, the private sector (chambers of&#13;
commerce and industry) and environmental nongovernmantal organizations. The&#13;
Secretary of CAAM is also the Director of the Environment Office of the National&#13;
Planning Department (CONADE). A number of ministries and agencies which are&#13;
members of CAAM's Executive Board including CONADE, the National Forestry and&#13;
Wildlife Institute (INEFAN) and the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) are&#13;
implementing environmental projects with support from the InterAmerican Development&#13;
Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). CAAM is currently receiving support&#13;
from the European Community, UNDP, USAID and the Government of Switzerland.&#13;
4.    Over the last few years numerous multilateral, bilateral agencies and international&#13;
nongovernmental organizations have been providing support to Ecuador's environment&#13;
sector. In 1994, the IDB began to provide support to CONADE for the design and&#13;
implementation of a system of environmental assessment. More recently, IDB approved&#13;
three important environmental initiatives: (i) Environmental Planning in the Galapagos, (ii)&#13;
Coastal Resources Management, and (iii) Environmental Improvement in Quito. The EEC&#13;
recently approved a project to provide support through CAAM to undertake&#13;
environmental remediation in the Amazon region. In 1994, the Government of Switzerland&#13;
and the Government of Ecuador (GoE) agreed to undertake a sustainable natural&#13;
resources management project. The Bank has been providing limited support to the&#13;
environment sector through the Mining Sector TA, the GEF Biodiversity Protection&#13;
Project, the Ozone Protection Project and the Lower Guayas Watershed Project.&#13;
5.    Given the level of donor activity in the environment sector, the Bank and the GoE&#13;
during the identification and preparation stages of the project identified important gaps in&#13;
environmental technical assistance. The design of the project and the selection of project&#13;
components is consistent with these findings and with the NEAP and will address some of&#13;
the most pressing environmental problems affecting both the health of the population and&#13;
sectors whose economy depends on a non-polluted ecosystem.&#13;
6.    During project preparation, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were given&#13;
the opportunity to provide input into the overall design of the project, primarily through&#13;
the National Council of Environmental NGOs (CEDENMA). CEDENMA is an umbrella&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
environmental NGO representing over 30 national and provincial environmental NGOs&#13;
and as a member of CAAM provides the mechanism for NGO input into CAAM'S work&#13;
program. In addition, a social scientist participated in the project preparation, which&#13;
included a visit to selected communities in the Amazon Region. His recommendations&#13;
have been fully incorporated into the project design. During the appraisal mission, the&#13;
Bank team met with the senior management of CEDENMA and environmental NGOs&#13;
based in the Amazon region including the Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia and Accion&#13;
Ecologica. Together, these efforts provided NGOs with an opportunity to provide&#13;
comments on the proposed project as well as suggestions on how to improve and expand&#13;
the consultative process. During project implementation, institutional mechanisms will be&#13;
established to enhance the opportunity for NGO and local community participation. A&#13;
selected number of environmental NGOs and community organizations will also&#13;
participate in the design and implementation of specific subprojects.&#13;
7.    Legal and Inslitutional Frameworkfor Environmental Management. Addressing&#13;
the country's serious environmental problems is hindered by the lack of a well defined&#13;
legal and institutional framework for environmental management. However, recent&#13;
actions taken by the GoE have demonstrated a willingness to address the problems&#13;
associated with such framework. Most significant is the passage of an amendment to the&#13;
constitution strengthening the environmental provisions and the submission to the&#13;
Congress of a new Environmental Law. With support from the PPF and the PHRD,&#13;
CAAM has undertaken policy studies and organizational design related to the new&#13;
environmental law, the design of the new National Environmental Management Council&#13;
(CONAGA), and the design of a national campaign to mobilize public support and&#13;
participation for the new legal and institutional framework which will be implemented&#13;
and financed by the proposed project. This draft law is currently being reviewed and&#13;
revised by Congress and is expected to be enacted in 1996. The key principles of the new&#13;
law are described in Box 2. The current framework for environmental management are&#13;
guided by laws which are sufficient for the implementation of the technical assistance to be&#13;
provided under the loan. These laws include: the Prevention and Control of&#13;
Environmental Contamination Law (1976), the Program for Improving Poor&#13;
Neighborhoods and Low Income Housing, (CAVIP 1976), the Mining Law (1991), the&#13;
Hydrocarbon Law (1992), the Agricultural Development Law (1994), and laws which&#13;
established the Sub Secretary of Environmental Sanitation (SSA) within the Ministry of&#13;
Housing (MIDUVI), the Institute of Forestry, Natural Areas and Wildlife (INEFAN), and&#13;
the Institute for the Ecodevelopment of the Amazon (ECORAE), and the Health and&#13;
Water Codes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
BOX 2. The New Draft Environmental Law-Key Principles&#13;
(I) Promote community participation in environmental protection and resource&#13;
management.&#13;
(II) Strengthen the capacity of public sector agencies to develop and implement policies,&#13;
including the establishment of CONAGA as the key agency for environmental policy&#13;
development and implementation.&#13;
(III) Establish economic incentives to promote sound resource management.&#13;
(IV) Guarantee access to information on the government's environmental decision making&#13;
(V) Revise and update laws and develop and enforce standards to meet the provisions of&#13;
international agreements ratified by the Government.&#13;
8.    While the Bank views the enactment of the new law as an important step in&#13;
improving the overall framework for environmental management, the proposed technical&#13;
assistance project has been designed in a way to permit both national and local level&#13;
institutions with environmental responsibilities under the current legal framework the&#13;
opportunity to build institutional capacity and participatory processes. The results of the&#13;
activities supported under this loan will take on added importance when the new law is&#13;
approved.&#13;
Section B.     Project Description&#13;
9.    Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is twofold: (i) to provide&#13;
support for the ongoing process of implementing a national environmental strategy; and,&#13;
(ii) to assist the GoE in building up an environmental management capacity in three&#13;
priority geographic areas identified in the NEAP: urban areas, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and&#13;
the Amazon.&#13;
10.   The specific objectives of the project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of CAAM&#13;
to undertake environmental policy analysis and environmental program design and&#13;
management; (ii) strengthen the environmental management capability of three key&#13;
ministries; (iii) establish and strengthen urban environmental management capability in&#13;
selected urban areas; (iv) build institutional capacity and carry out the participatory&#13;
processes and technical analysis required to resolve two of Ecuador's most serious&#13;
environmental problems, particularly those related to pollution of the Gulf of Guayaquil&#13;
and the area in the Amazon most affected by oil exploration and production. These&#13;
objectives will be achieved through the implementation of studies, workshops, public&#13;
relations campaigns, demonstration sub-projects, and data base development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
11.   The expected results of this project are the preparation of a well defined legal and&#13;
institutional framework for environmental planning and management; improved&#13;
environmental planning, policy making and management at the national and municipal&#13;
levels; and, the design of both technical solutions and participatory processes for&#13;
improving the environmental quality of the Gulf of Guayaquil and areas in the Amazon&#13;
affected by petroleum activities. Progress in achieving these results will be monitored&#13;
based on quantitative and qualitative indicators of project outcomes and impacts.&#13;
12.   Project Description. The proposed Environmental Management Project would&#13;
consist of four components:&#13;
(a)   Component 1: Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening (Total&#13;
cost: US$6.5 million);&#13;
(b)   Component 2: Environmental Planning and Management in the&#13;
Ecuadorian Amazon (Total cost: US$3.1 million);&#13;
(c)   Component 3: Municipal Environmental Management (Total cost:&#13;
US$3.9 million); and&#13;
(d)   Component 4:' Environmental Information and Management in the Gulf of&#13;
Guayaquil (Total cost: US$6.5 million);&#13;
13.   The subcomponents to be undertaken under each component and their rationale&#13;
are described below.&#13;
Component 1: Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening&#13;
14.   This component will consist of four subcomponents corresponding to the four&#13;
agencies which will carry out project activities: (i) CAAM, (ii) MIDUVI, (iii) MICIP and&#13;
(iv) MEM. Details on the specific subcomponents are presented below. The total&#13;
component cost is $ 6.5 million.&#13;
The CAAM Subcomponent (US$2, 800,000).&#13;
15.   The CAAM subcomponent will support: (i) strengthen the capacity of CAAM to&#13;
undertake environmental policy analysis, environmental program design and management,&#13;
and undertake a promotional campaign to mobilize public support for, and participation in,&#13;
those activities; (ii) the review and updating of the pollution control legislation and the&#13;
establishment of appropriate guidelines and standards, including the development of a&#13;
national system of environmental impact assessment; (iii) the design and implementation of&#13;
a national environmental information system; and (iv) the establishment and support of the&#13;
project implementation unit (PIU) in CAAM.&#13;
The MIDUVI Subcomponent (US$1,420, 000)&#13;
16.   After a recent ministry reorganization, the responsibilities for water and solid&#13;
waste policy were vested in the Subsecretary of Environmental Sanitation (SSA) within&#13;
the MIDUVI. While the management and operations of most water and solid waste&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
systems are being turned over to the municipalities, the SSA will handle policy&#13;
development and monitoring. The MIDUVI subcomponent will support: (i) the design of&#13;
water quality policies and an improvement of the current system for water quality&#13;
monitoring; (ii) the design of a national solid waste management policy; and (iii) the&#13;
training of staff in the environmental unit.&#13;
The MICIP Subcomponent (US$1,500,000)&#13;
17.   The MICIP has responsibilities for the design of trade and industrial policies and&#13;
fisheries. Currently, the MICIP has a small environmental unit which was set up to&#13;
implement activities under the Montreal Protocol. MICIP would like to upgrade and&#13;
improve its capacity to develop and implement industrial pollution control policies and&#13;
fisheries management and monitoring. The MICIP subcomponent will support: (i) the&#13;
incorporation of environmental assessment and environmental policy development&#13;
capabilities into the ministry's operations; (ii) the design of industrial pollution prevention&#13;
and control policies; and (iii) the review of existing fisheries policies and the preparation of&#13;
revised regulations including the upgrading of the fisheries resource monitoring systems;&#13;
and (iv) the training of staff from the environmental unit.&#13;
The MEM Subcomponent (US$780, 000)&#13;
18.   Over the last five years and with limited resources, the Subsecretary of&#13;
Environment has been working to develop a set of sectoral environmental policies. With&#13;
support from a Bank Technical Assistance Loan (EC-PA-7123), the Division of&#13;
Environment (DINAMA) is developing environmental guidelines and procedures for the&#13;
mining sector. The Subsecretary is now requesting Bank support for technical assistance&#13;
for the development of environmental procedures and guidelines for the petroleum sector,&#13;
strengthening of environmental analysis capability within the ministry and other energy&#13;
related agencies. Activities to be undertaken in this component will complement the&#13;
activities supported under the Amazon Management Component. The MEM&#13;
subcomponent will support: (i) environmental assessment and environmental policy&#13;
formulation capabilities into the ministry's operations; (ii) review of environmental impact&#13;
studies and the development of environmental monitoring procedures, environmental&#13;
training for capacity building of environmental units within the Ministry and&#13;
PetroEcuador; and, (iii) dissemination of guidelines and regulations for the petroleum&#13;
sector.&#13;
19.   Under the Institutional Strengthening Component support will be provided for the&#13;
acquisition of office and computer equipment, consultant services, training for CAAM&#13;
and the three ministries and PetroEcuador. The total component cost is (US$6.5 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Component 2: Environmental Planning and Management in the Ecuadorian&#13;
Amazon&#13;
20.   This component addresses the most important environmental problems facing the&#13;
Ecuadorian Amazon: unsustainable renewable resource use, the environmental impact of&#13;
petroleum exploration and production, the lack of ecologically and culturally sensitive&#13;
regional development planning, and the need for improved community level organization.&#13;
In addition to the specific sub-components and activities which will be implemented, this&#13;
component will attempt to solidify existing institutional mechanisms for consultation&#13;
between the participating agencies and community organizations and NGOs, and through&#13;
the project, establish new institutional arrangements for broadening the consultative&#13;
process. These mechanisms and arrangements include: existing avenues for consultation&#13;
and input through the Institute for the Development of the Amazon Region (ECORAE),&#13;
and CEDENMA and the establishment of the Comite de Proyeclos Ambientales en la&#13;
Regi6n Amaz6nica (CPA), a grants/subprojects review committee (see para 48). The key&#13;
institutions which will implement the project's subcomponents include:Municipal&#13;
Government of Shushufindi, CAAM, PetroEcuador, and selected NGO's and community&#13;
organizations. Annex 9 describes the consultative process during preparation and the&#13;
process for information exchange and consultation which will occur during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
21.   This component will comprise of three distinct but related subcomponents: (i) a&#13;
Pilot Plan for Environmentally Sustainable Development of the Shushufindi Area; (ii)&#13;
Support (small grants) to Local Organizations; and (iii) the Sustainable Development&#13;
Program. The total component cost is US$3. Imillion.&#13;
The Shushufindi Subcomponent (US$1,700,000)&#13;
22.   The Shushufindi area has been the site of intensive petroleum production for more&#13;
that 20 years. While the economy of the area has grown, the patterns of development are&#13;
characteristic of frontier settlements. Land use and infrastructure planning have not kept&#13;
pace with population growth or the changing economic base. At the same time the&#13;
indigenous population has reaped very limited economic and social benefits from the oil&#13;
economy. The Shushufindi subcomponent will support: (i) urban and regional land use&#13;
planning, including the implementation of the proposed small scale water supply and&#13;
sewage infrastructure subprojects; (ii) studies on sustainable land use legislation and&#13;
policy; and (iii) support for environmental impact monitoring with local NGOs. The Bank&#13;
will finance goods and other costs (excluding works). Eligibility and selection of&#13;
subprojects will conform to procedures to be described in the project Operating Manual.&#13;
The total component costs are US$3.1 I million.&#13;
Support to Local Organizations Subcomponent (US$400, 000)&#13;
23.   Increasingly, local community based organizations and NGOs are seen as the best&#13;
vehicles to achieving sustainable development. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, these groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
have become more active and vocal in attempting to gain greater public participation in&#13;
the design and implementation of development programs. Towards this end, the&#13;
Government in 1993 created ECORAE. ECORAE is charged with the task of assisting&#13;
local organizations in meeting their development goals through the provision of technical&#13;
assistance. In the context of implementation of this component, local NGOs will not only&#13;
have an opportunity to implement subprojects, but will be fully involved as stakeholders in&#13;
the consultative process through their representation on the CPA.&#13;
24.   The Support to Local Organizations subcomponent will include: (i) evaluations of&#13;
the environmental problems and the socio-economic and management requirements of&#13;
selected communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon; and (ii) a small grants program for&#13;
community organizations and NGOs (maximum grant amount not to exceed US$15,000).&#13;
Eligibility and selection of subprojects will conform to procedures to be described in the&#13;
project Operating Manual.&#13;
Sustainable Development Program Subcomponent (US$1,000,000)&#13;
25.   Despite the growth of the petroleum economy, most communities in the&#13;
Shushufindi area still rely on natural resources for their livelihood. Many of these&#13;
communities have experienced extensive deforestation related to petroleum production&#13;
activities and population growth from colonization. Reforestation and improved&#13;
management of existing native forests is a high priority. The river systems in the area also&#13;
appear, from preliminary studies, to have potential for aquaculture development. In some&#13;
areas coffee production has become an important cash crop, but significant improvements&#13;
in the farmning system could be achieved with improved technology. The Sustainable&#13;
Development subcomponent will support through sub-projects and related studies: (i)&#13;
community participation in reforestation and other community based environmental&#13;
improvement activities; (ii) pilot projects in fish farming; and (iii) analysis of technology&#13;
options for coffee production. Eligibility and selection of subprojects will conform to&#13;
procedures to be described in the project Operating Manual.&#13;
26.   Under the Environmental Management of the Amazon Component support will be&#13;
provided for the acquisition of office and computer equipment, consultant services, seed&#13;
stock for reforestation and fish farming, materials for small scale infrastructure&#13;
development, and training for all participating institutions.&#13;
Component 3: Municipal/Provincial Environmental Management&#13;
27.   This component will address priority areas for environmental management by&#13;
focusing activities at three levels: (i) large urban centers; (ii) small and medium size cities&#13;
and the province of Manabi; and (iii) low income neighborhoods of 8 cities. Program&#13;
approaches for improving environmental management in each of these areas have been&#13;
tailored to meet the most pressing environmental problems and the most suitable&#13;
institutional framework for implementation. The key institutions which will implement this&#13;
component include: MIDUVI, the Association of Municipalities (AME), the Provincial&#13;
Council of Manabi, and the Municipal Governments of Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
28.   This component will be comprised of five distinct subcomponents: (i)&#13;

environmental management challenges facing the Gulf of Guayaquil: fisheries, shrimp&#13;
aquaculture and coastal resources management, watershed management; water pollution,&#13;
water quality and water resources management, inadequate and incomplete scientific&#13;
information, inadequate enforcement of environmental policies, and the lack of&#13;
interinstitutional coordination and management among national level government agencies,&#13;
municipalities and the most important industries whose productive activities impact the&#13;
environmental quality of the Gulf The key institutions which will implement the&#13;
subcomonents include: The Ministry of Agriculture (MAG), the National Fisheries&#13;

42.   Under the Gulf of Guayaquil Component support will be provided for the&#13;
acquisition of office and computer equipment, and consultant services. Training will be&#13;
provided to implementing agencies as required for the execution of each subcomponent.&#13;
Section C      Project Costs and Financing&#13;
43.   The total cost of the project over four years (excluding taxes and including&#13;
contingencies) is US$20 million, approximately 18% of which is estimated to be foreign&#13;
exchange. The Government is requesting an IBRD loan of US$15 million. The remaining&#13;
counterpart funds of (US$5 million) will be provided by the GoE, AME and the&#13;
municipalities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. Financing for the project operations in&#13;
Year One will amount to US$4.7 million of which the Bank will provide up to US$3.8&#13;
million. It is estimated that Year One disbursements will be approximately US$2.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Project costs and implementation schedules can be found in Annex 3 and 4. The Year One&#13;
cost table can be found in Annex 5.&#13;
Section D      Project Administration and Implementation&#13;
44.   The borrower is the Republic of Ecuador. The executing agency is Office of the&#13;
President through CAAM. The overall management of the project will be under a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) located in CAAM. The project would finance the costs&#13;
required to run the PIU, including: a project coordinator, coordinators for each&#13;
component, a training specialist and a procurement specialist. The PIU will ensure&#13;
consistency in the application of Bank Procurement/Auditing and other guidelines. Terms&#13;
of reference for the PIU coordinators and the training specialist can be found in Annex 8.&#13;
45.   Arrangements. Overall responsibility for project coordination and execution rests&#13;
with CAAM. During preparation CAAM established a Project Preparation Unit (PPU) to&#13;
manage a US$450,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF) and US$550.000 equivalent&#13;
PHRD Japanese Grant. In the last three years, this Unit has been entrusted with the&#13;
responsibility for managing the procurement and disbursement of more than US$15&#13;
million, from several international donors, including a May 1995 grant from the European&#13;
Economic Commission for 10.0 million ECUs, small grants from several European&#13;
governments (Sweden, Switzerland), and from IDB for a project in the Galapagos. The&#13;
Unit has done a remarkable job considering their size and the different management&#13;
requirements of each donor.&#13;
46.   Because of the large number of organizations which will implement project&#13;
activities under the four components, specific responsibilities and operational procedures&#13;
for executing a particular component or subcomponent would be specified into&#13;
implementation agreements or institutional arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to be&#13;
signed between CAAM and each implementing agency. These agreements (acceptable to&#13;
the Bank) will specify both the technical and the financial responsibilities for all aspects of&#13;
project implementation, including the preparation of annual work plans and the provision&#13;
of counterpart resources. CAAM provided the Bank with draft "letters of intent" before&#13;
appraisal. Decisions regarding these institutional responsibilities are spelled out in the&#13;
annual operating plan for the year one.&#13;
47.   For the Guayaquil Component, CAAM would delegate project implementation to&#13;
a management unit under CEDEGE, which would take primary responsibility for&#13;
implementation of the component, according to a detailed annual work plan, satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. The Comisi6n Mixta para el Desarrollo Sustentable del Golfo de Guayaquil,&#13;
comprising key implementing agencies will monitor implementation of the Guayaquil&#13;
Component and provide political support to the project. A Guayaquil Management Unit&#13;
(GMUJ) will be created to ensure that project objectives and procedures are followed. The&#13;
GMU will: (i) coordinate the technical implementation; (ii) supervise the execution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
studies, consultancies and training programs; (iii) approve the acquisition of equipment;&#13;
and (iv) prepare reports and annual operating plans for the component.&#13;
48.   For the Environmental Planning and Management in the Amazon, a project&#13;
committee, Comite de Proyectos Ambientales en la Regi6n Amaz6nica (CPA), would be&#13;
established with participation of ECORAE, MEM, PetroEcuador, representatives of&#13;
provincial and municipal governments, and local NGOs, under the overall coordination of&#13;
CAAM. CAAM will prepare specific criteria acceptable to the Bank for subproject&#13;
approval. Criteria are likely to include: importance to the local environment, community&#13;
participation, project sustainablility, eligibility requirements, potential for replication, and a&#13;
cost ceiling. The CPA will: (i) meet twice a year to review and recommend grant&#13;
proposals for subprojects to finance environmental activities; (ii) review and comment on&#13;
the annual operating plan for the Amazon presented by CAAM in close consultation with&#13;
ECORAE; (iii) approve the communication and dissemination plan for the component; and&#13;
(v) recommend that the results of the studies are adopted and incorporated into the&#13;
operating plans and budgets of ECORAE, the Provincial Government, Municipal&#13;
Government, and PetroEcuador.&#13;
49.   For the Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening and Municipal&#13;
Environmental Management components, CAAM will make institutional arrangements&#13;
acceptable to the Bank with MICIP, MIDUVI, and MEM. These organizations will be&#13;
responsible for implementing their corresponding subcomponents.&#13;
50.   Project Management. At CAAM, the PIU will have the responsibility for overall&#13;
project execution, including all bidding processes, preparation and presentation of&#13;
disbursement requests, management of project accounts, and preparation of project&#13;
reports. An Executive Board for the project comprised of representatives from CAAM,&#13;
MIDUVI, MICIP, MEM, AME, ECORAE, CEDEGE, and CENDENMA will be&#13;
established with responsibility for setting overall policy and institutional strategies,&#13;
insuring interinstitutional coordination, approving operating plans and monitoring project&#13;
impacts. A Project Operating Manual containing project management procedures will be&#13;
prepared by CAAM. Adoption of the manual will be a condition for effectiveness of the&#13;
loan.&#13;
51.   Bank Supervision. Supervision will be based on the agreed monitoring of project&#13;
impact indicators. These were finalized during negotiations. The project requires about 65&#13;
staff weeks of Bank supervision over the life of the project of which 20 staff weeks is&#13;
estimated for each of the first two years of implementation. A substantial amount of&#13;
project supervision will be provided through the Bank Resident Mission in Quito.&#13;
52.   Bank Project Review. Annual project reviews will: (i) evaluate progress of the&#13;
operating plan for the previous year, based on indicators and targets specified in the&#13;
Operating Manual ; (ii) review and approve the annual operating plans for the following&#13;
year for each component, which includes monitoring indicators and key targets, project&#13;
impact, terms of reference for major consultancies, and a schedule of main activities; (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
assess the performance of the PIU; (iv) review project dissemination and the level of NGO&#13;
participation in design of project activities as reflected in future work programs and&#13;
operating plans; (v) visit project sites; (vi) review--at random--procurement processes not&#13;
requiring prior Bank approval; (vii) review financial procedures and the project account;&#13;
(viii) review compliance with legal covenants and auditing practices; and (ix) prepare a&#13;
comprehensive supervision report.&#13;
53.   Annual reviews will be based on annual operating plans which will be prepared by&#13;
CAAM including a detailed evaluation of the current years targets and accomplishments.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations regarding the preparation and submission of&#13;
semi-annual progress reports, annual operating plans and annual reviews. Semi-Annual&#13;
progress reports will be submitted to the Bank no later than January 31 and July 31 for&#13;
each year of project implementation, comencing January 31,1997. Annual operatng plans&#13;
will be submitted to the Bank no later than April 30 of each year. CAAM will review&#13;
yearly progress in the implementation of the project and in the case of unsatisfactory&#13;
progress, undertake the required remedial action. The Resident Mission will play a significant&#13;
role in the supervision of this project. Implementation tables for Year One and Year 1-Year 4 are&#13;
detailed in Annex 3-5.&#13;
54.   Procurement. Procurement of goods (including vehicles, computer equipment,&#13;
office equipment and supplies, laboratory equipment, etc.) and goods and services for the&#13;
public awareness campaign ( including audio/video production services, TV/Radio&#13;
broadcast services, pamphlet production and program design services) would be done by&#13;
CAAM in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines under IBRD Loan and IDA&#13;
Credits issued January 1995. Contracts for goods and services estimated to cost (i) less&#13;
than US$25,000 would be awarded through national shopping procedures up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1,900,000, (ii) US$25,000 or more but less than US$50,000&#13;
would be awarded through international shopping procedures up to US$1,300,000, and&#13;
(iii) US$50,000 or more through limited international bidding (LIB), among suppliers with&#13;
service and maintenance facilities in Ecuador. International competitive bidding (ICB) is&#13;
not appropriate for any procurement under this project, since no contract is expected to&#13;
cost more than US$100,000. Procurement of goods and services exceeding US$25,000 in&#13;
value will be subject to ex-ante review by the Bank. Procurement of materials and&#13;
equipment by private beneficiaries for subprojects would be done according to national&#13;
shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. The contracting of consultants would be&#13;
done by CAAM in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the Bank as Executing Agency issued August 1981, using Bank issued&#13;
standard forms of contract and standard letters of invitation acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Consultants' services per contract amounting to more than US$25,000 for firms and&#13;
US$10,000 for individuals will require prior Bank review. These prior review thresholds&#13;
would result in a coverage of above 80 percent of the loan. All procurement issues will be&#13;
reviewed with CAAM during supervision. CAAM will be responsible for preparing semi-&#13;
annual progress reports and annual operating plans acceptable to the Bank. Project&#13;
accounts will be audited annually by external independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

56.   Auditing. All project accounts will be audited annually by external independent&#13;
auditors according to recognized international standards. The audits will include the&#13;
special account and the project account at CAAM. CAAM will submit certified copies of&#13;
the accounts and annual audit reports to the Bank no later than four months after the end&#13;
of each fiscal year. Audit periods end on June 30 of each year. All audit costs will be&#13;
financed by the Government of Ecuador.&#13;
57.   Monitoring and Evaluation. Regular reporting of project performance and&#13;
advance project planning is essential for the efficient and timely implementation of the&#13;
project. In this regard the PIU will be responsible for the preparation of two reports: (i) an&#13;
Annual Operating Plan to be presented by not later than April 30 of each year; and (ii)&#13;
Semi-Annual Progress Reports to be presented January 31 and July 31 for each year. The&#13;
Annual Operating Plan will be a time slice of the project with detailed operational targets&#13;
and estimated financial resource required. The Semi-Annual Reports will focus on&#13;
evaluation of the progress made against the Annual Operating Plan. It will also identify&#13;
constraints to project implementation and identify possible solutions. The information&#13;
contained in these reports together with the annual reviews will provide data for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of project impact. The Project Operating Manual will include&#13;
an annex which will identify initial baseline data for each subcomponent. This data will be&#13;
extracted from the institutional and environmental analysis undertaken during project&#13;
preparation and from other secondary sources. The characterization of the baseline data&#13;
will conform to the specific activities to be undertaken: studies, training, dissemination,&#13;
small scale infrastructure and community participation. Project performance will be&#13;
evaluated based on these initial qualitative and quantitative assessments and will be&#13;
examined in detail following the second year of project implementation. Indicators of&#13;
project outcome and impacts can be found in Annex 6 and 7.&#13;
Section E       Benefits and Risks&#13;
58.   This project will mainly provide benefits to populations living in Ecuador's urban&#13;
areas, communities surrounding the Gulf of Guayaquil, and communities in the&#13;
Shushufindi region of the Amazon. The most important benefits include: the development&#13;
of guidelines and standards for industrial pollution control; and, the analysis of factors and&#13;
policy options which can contribute to sustainable shrimp aquaculture and fisheries in the&#13;
Gulf of Guayaquil. The proposed project will help the government carry out its&#13;
environmental commitments by preparing the legal framework and strengthening the&#13;
institutional framework for environmental management and preparing the requisite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
guidelines, procedures and standards for environmental impact assessment. Communities&#13;
in the Amazon and low income urban areas will directly benefit from the proposed pilot&#13;
environmental improvement projects.&#13;
59.   The project's main risks include limited commitment from participating agencies&#13;
and ineffective implementation of the project. The risk of limited commitment is reduced&#13;
by two factors. First, the commitment of the key participating agencies has been&#13;
established in signed letters of intent, and will be confirmed by implementation&#13;
arrangements and agreements (Convenios) which are a condition of effectiveness/&#13;
disbursement. Second, the programmatic design of the project based on annual operating&#13;
plans provides both flexibility to adjust the allocation of resources and promotes&#13;
competition among the project entities to get access to the technical assistance provided&#13;
by the project. The risk of ineffective implementation of the project has been addressed by&#13;
selecting CAAM, duly empowered to coordinate project activities, as the managing&#13;
institution of the overall project, in charge of all procurement and disbursement activities&#13;
under the project. CAAM has a good record managing the PPF as well as several grants&#13;
from international donors, including the Interamerican Development Bank, and the&#13;
European Commission. The project's strong emphasis on coordination and consultation&#13;
with national and local level NGO's and communities will ensure effective targeting and&#13;
implementation of the pilot subprojects. Supervision of the project will be carried out by&#13;
CAAM assisted by specialists for the more complex activities to be hired under the&#13;
project. Bank supervision will be concentrated in CAAM. Additionally, an experienced&#13;
long-term consultant has been hired to provide a close supervision of the project from the&#13;
Bank's Representative Office in Quito. The GoE has selected a fixed rate SCL in US&#13;
Dollars in order to manage the risks associated with the foreign currency composition of&#13;
their assets and liabilities and to reduce their exposure to LIBOR volatility for the&#13;
country's overall debt portfolio.&#13;
Section F      Agreements&#13;
60.   Conditions of Effectiveness: (a) Signature of one institutional arrangement&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank related to The Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Component; (b) Signature of one agreement with a Municipality; and (c) adoption of a&#13;
Project Operating Manual satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
61.   Conditions of Disbursement: (a) Disbursements for project activities covered by&#13;
specific Convenios would be conditional upon signature of the pertinent Convenio.&#13;
62.   Assurances: (a) CAAM will submit the Annual Operating Plan yearly by the agreed&#13;
date; (b) Subprojects will be selected, financed and implemented in accordance with the&#13;
Operating Manual; (c) CAAM will review yearly progress in the implementation of the&#13;
project and in the case of unsatisfactory progress, remedial action will be taken.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
BANK EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Lessons Learnedfrom Past Bank Projects&#13;
I .    Since 1991, the Bank has been active in developing institutional strengthening&#13;
projects for the environmental sector in a variety of borrower countries including Bolivia,&#13;
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, , Honduras, Indonesia and Mexico. The experience to date&#13;
indicates that a well defined legal and institutional framework for environmental&#13;
management is important for policy development, environmental monitoring and the&#13;
implementation of environmental programs, including procedures for environmental&#13;
impact assessments.&#13;
2.    The design of the proposed project has also taken into account recent analytical&#13;
work such as the Bank's Urban Environmental Problems in National Environmental&#13;
Strategies and Action Plans, 1994. These studies suggest that environmental management&#13;
projects need to be designed in a way which effectively deal with political realities and&#13;
implement appropriate project management training as well as establishing environmental&#13;
management priorities and public participation processes.&#13;

            Management Technical Assistance Project are twofold: (i) to
            provide support for the ongoing process of implementing a
            national environmental strategy; and (ii) to assist the
            Government in building up an environmental management
            capacity in urban areas, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and the
            Amazon. The project consists of the following components:
            (a) policy formulation and institutional strengthening; (b)
            environmental planning and management in the Ecuadorian
            Amazon; (c) municipal environmental management; and (d)
            environmental information and management in the Gulf of Guayaquil.
