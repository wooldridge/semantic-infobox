&#13;
         Produced by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Urban Development and Resilience Unit of the&#13;
         Sustainable Development Network, the Urban Development Series discusses the&#13;
         challenge of urbanization and what it will mean for developing countries in the&#13;
         decades ahead. The Series aims to explore and delve more substantively into the&#13;
         core issues framed by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems of Cities:&#13;
         Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the five&#13;
         domains of the Urban Strategy, the Series provides a focal point for publications&#13;
         that seek to foster a better understanding of (i) the core elements of the city&#13;
         system, (ii) pro-poor policies, (iii) city economies, (iv) urban land and housing&#13;
         markets, (v) sustainable urban environment, and other urban issues germane to&#13;
         the urban development agenda for sustainable cities and communities.&#13;

This report is organized in five sections. Section 1 presents             Natural disasters can result in high economic losses, hu-&#13;

their location on the coastline or interior, and their rank               are geo-referenced and overlaid with climate change and&#13;
in terms of level of vulnerability. Section 3 outlines the                natural disaster risks, which allows for the ranking of the&#13;
characteristics that historic cities have in terms of carbon              WHC most at risk.&#13;

Section 4 discusses the sources of financing which WHC                    CARBON EMISSIONS FROM&#13;

WHC are at significant risk of deterioration. Climate                     characteristics of historic cores of WHC make them more&#13;

residential and commercial buildings in the United States&#13;
constituted about 39 percent of total energy consumed&#13;
nationwide. In most climates, historic cities have lower&#13;
operation energy than new construction. The reason can&#13;
be attributed to the absence of heating and cooling sys-&#13;
tems in historic buildings and their passive design; passive&#13;
survivability (building operates without energy inputs for&#13;
key functions, such as during a power failure); and the&#13;
compactness of the urban form and positioning of the&#13;
buildings next to one another, which acts as an insulation&#13;
system. Building transportation energy is related to mo-&#13;
bility patterns and is the energy that is used to transport&#13;
people to and from a building. Due to transportation ef-&#13;
ficiencies in the historic cores, this category of energy is&#13;
minimal compared to the newer parts of the city.&#13;

The dense and compact urban form of historic cores has&#13;
several climatic advantages. The historic urban form is con-&#13;

various land uses in a tight relationship with each other. The&#13;

   to Las Vegas (3,200Km) or by powering the average American home for a month. Copenhagenâ&#128;&#153;s policy in favor of urban&#13;

            While the negative impacts of climate
            change on urban areas are well-known and widely discussed,
            its implicit impacts on historic downtowns have not been
            studied as extensively. In recent years, cultural heritage
            conservation and valorization have increasingly become
            drivers of local economic development. Many projects
            supported by the World Bank in this field help leverage
            cultural heritage for economic development while developing
            infrastructure and services for residents and enhancing the
            livability of cities. The World Bank has also been very
            active in addressing climate change risks and increasing
            resiliency of urban areas. This paper is an effort to merge
            these two critical agendas. The paper investigates the
            impacts of climate change on 237 world heritage cities (WHC)
            and provides an overview of the geographic distribution of
            these cities around the globe. It discusses the importance
            of historic downtowns and provides various options available
            to the governments of these cities to address risk
            mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Further, it
            provides examples of WHC which have taken action to address
            vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. This
            report is organized in following five sections: section one
            presents an overview of WHC, geographic distribution, and
            the growth of the urban agglomerations to which they belong.
            Section two presents the natural hazard risks and climate
            change impacts facing WHC, their location on the coastline
            or interior, and their rank in terms of level of
            vulnerability. Section three outlines the characteristics
            that historic cities have in terms of carbon emissions and
            potential for climate change mitigation. Section four
            discusses the sources of financing which WHC may turn to in
            order to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.
            Section five presents the climate change adaptation and
            mitigation action plans being implemented in the WHC of
            Paris, Tunis, Edinburgh, Mexico City, Hue, and Quito.
