MESSAE  ROM  T              ExcUTI   VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
I am pleased to report on MIGA's achievements during fiscal 1997. On the Guarantee&#13;
side, MIGA continued its claims-free record into its eighth year of operations and further&#13;
diversified its portfolio by adding 11 countries, bringing to 52 the number of countries in&#13;
which the Agency has insured investments. Fiscal 1997 was a year of firsts for MIGA.&#13;
The Agency issued its first report to shareholders on the developmental effectiveness of&#13;
some of the projects it has insured. In addition, MIGA signed its first quota share reinsur-&#13;
ance agreement with a private insurance company. The agreement, which took effect in&#13;
January 1997, will make MIGA`s underwriting strategy more effective by giving the Agency&#13;
additional guarantee capacity across its portfolio while keeping its own risk exposure&#13;
within existing project and country limits. As a result of this agreement, the growth in&#13;
MIGA's exposure was significantly offset by reinsurance, and therefore MIGA's exposure&#13;
at the end of fiscal 1997 recorded only a relatively modest increase over the level at the&#13;
end of fiscal 1996, an especially welcome development in light of the financial con-&#13;
straints under which MIGA is operating.&#13;
In the annual report for fiscal 1996, 1 noted that MIGA had begun to address the need&#13;
for a future enhancement of its capital base. Substantial progress was made this fiscal&#13;
year: there was full support from shareholders for the need to increase MIGA's guarantee&#13;
capacity and recognition that the twin issues of capacity headroom and liquidity cushion&#13;
must be addressed to support future business expansion. There was broad support for&#13;
the technical assessment of the size of the required increase in operating capital (paid-in&#13;
capital plus reserves and retained earnings) and subscribed capital. Shareholders are&#13;
currently giving consideration to the most appropriate sources of funding.&#13;
I am also pleased to report that as a result of the efforts of its Investment Marketing&#13;
Services Department (IMS), MIGA has developed a more user-friendly version of IPAnet&#13;
that is gaining substantial support from users, including investment promotion agencies&#13;
(IPAs) and others who wish to disseminate invest-             4t&#13;
ment-related information. MIGA's capacity-build-&#13;
ing activities for IPAs and conferences for the min-&#13;
ing and tourism sectors were also very successful.&#13;
Because three years have elapsed since the major&#13;
restructuring and reorientation of MIGA's techni-&#13;
cal assistance activities that led to the creation of&#13;
IMS, it is now time to evaluate the changes that&#13;
have taken place and the results that have been&#13;
achieved. I am committed to undertaking such a&#13;
review in the coming fiscal year.&#13;

(QUICK CLICK above to your destination)&#13;
The Multilateral Investmnent Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was established on April 12,&#13;
1988, as the newest member organization of the World Bank Group. Its purpose is to&#13;
encourage the flow of foreign direct investment to its developing member countries for&#13;
economic development. Its primary means of facilitating investment is through the provision&#13;
of investment guarantees against the risks of currency transfer, expropriation, and war and&#13;
civil disturbance ('political risks").&#13;

KAFCO PROJECT IN BANGLADESH&#13;
PROVES A SHOWCASE FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT&#13;
In fiscal 1991 and 1992, MIGA issued four guarantee contracts covering portions of&#13;
investrnents by Marubeni and Chiyoda Corporation in Karnaphuli Fertilizer Com-&#13;
pany Limited (KAFCO). The $516 million project involved the construction and&#13;
operation of a major amrmonia and granular urea processing plant near Chittagong&#13;
City. MIGA-together with four other investment insurers, eight export credit agen-&#13;
cies, two development assistance agencies, and a consortium of private equity and&#13;
debt investors-helped facilitate the creation of the largest single private invest-&#13;
ment ever made in Bangladesh. It was the first time that many of the investors and&#13;
agencies had seriously considered a major project in Bangladesh.&#13;
MIGA reviewed the project in September 1996 and found that it has had a very&#13;
positive impact on the country. In fact, KAFCO is viewed as a showcase for foreign&#13;
investment in Bangladesh. The project has also served as an example to domestic&#13;
firms for its advanced technology, product quality, human resources management,&#13;
and investment in social infrastructure. The positive developmental effects of the&#13;
project include:&#13;
l An aggressive training program that demonstrates a strong commitment to human&#13;
capital development and has more than 1,000 participants.&#13;
* Creation of more than 600 permanent jobs for local nationals and another 300&#13;
jobs through contractors (the project employs only five expatriates).&#13;
_ Utilization of modem fertilizer technology that allowed Bangladeshi ammonia&#13;
to be introduced as an export product.&#13;
* Provision of a complete social infrastructure for project emnployees, including&#13;
housing, transportation, medical services, a school, a mosque, and recreation&#13;
facilities.&#13;
* Stimulation of many local businesses,&#13;
* Generation of significant export earnings.&#13;

AND LOAN INVESTMENTS IN GUINEAN FLOUR MILL&#13;
Societe des Grands Moulins de Guinee, S.A,, the project enterprise, is 21 percent&#13;
owned by local private interests. It will initially have the capacity to mill 170 tons of&#13;
wheat flour and bran per day. Bran will be available for export immediately, but&#13;
flour will initially be sold only on the local market with a view to later increasing&#13;
capacity and exporting to neighboring countries. The flour produced will be fresher,&#13;
of higher quality, and significantly less expensive than imported flour. Local flour&#13;
distributors and users will benefit from a local source of high-quality flou.&#13;
The project is expected to generate $1.4 million in net foreign exchange per year&#13;
for the country as a result of import substitution and export revenues. Additional&#13;
benefits will accrue from the diversification of economic activities in the country,&#13;
which is still heavily dependent on mining revenues. Guinea will further benefit&#13;
from the transfer of modem technology and superior quality-control techniques in&#13;
flour processing and treatment. The project will create about 70 jobs for Guineans,&#13;
who wil receive administrative and technical training In addition, the project will&#13;
sponsor university training programs and events for the local community.,&#13;

MIGA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
STATEMENT OF AGENCY PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group. The Agency is designed to help developing countries&#13;
attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated&#13;
public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial&#13;
risks and a program of consultative and advisory services to promote improvements in mem-&#13;
ber countries' environments for foreign investment.&#13;
NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING&#13;
AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Intemational Account-&#13;
ing Standards. In the absence of such standards and subject to relevant legal requirements,&#13;
the policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA hav-&#13;
ing regard to the accounting principles used in the United States and the practices of other&#13;
international insurance entities. The accounting policies followed are consistent in all mate-&#13;
rial respects with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting Stan-&#13;
dards and generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates&#13;
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results&#13;
could differ from those estimates. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is&#13;
provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these financial statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the&#13;
purpose of summarizing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the&#13;
convenience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of&#13;
all its members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its&#13;
members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency envi-&#13;
ronment. As such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency&#13;
with assets in the same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to&#13;
match the currencies underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies.&#13;
The purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur&#13;
through operations. Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for&#13;
small amounts required to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period.&#13;
Capital subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income&#13;
and expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect&#13;
during each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock&#13;
of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right (SDR)&#13;

in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value&#13;
being equal to $1.082 for one SDR. The Convention further states that ten percent of the&#13;
members' shares be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing&#13;
member countries may pay up to a quarter of the ten percent in their own currencies. In&#13;
addition, another ten percent of the members' shares shall be paid in the form of nonnego-&#13;
tiable, noninterest-bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely convert-&#13;
ible currencies and are due on demand to meet the Agency's obligations. The policies&#13;
relating to translation of currencies as described above also apply to the cash and the&#13;
promissory notes paid in.&#13;
Investments&#13;
Management has both the ability and intent to hold all investments to maturity. Accordingly,&#13;
MIGA's investment holdings are carried at cost or amortized cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed&#13;
and ceded is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from&#13;
commitment fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time&#13;
guarantee capacity for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment&#13;
period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for losses inherent in guarantee operations based upon claim&#13;
submissions, consideration of loss experiences by insurers engaged in similar underwritings,&#13;
and other factors including changes in the composition and volume of the insurance and&#13;
outstanding guarantees and worldwide economic and political conditions. This reserve is&#13;
available to absorb losses related to insurance amounts outstanding, which are off-balance&#13;
sheet commitments. The reserve is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased&#13;
for claims settlements.&#13;
The periodic provision for claims is usually based on management's evaluation of potential&#13;
claim payments (net of expected recoveries) that may result from (i) risks that are inherent,&#13;
but unidentifiable at the time of writing; (ii) unusually large concentrations of exposure in&#13;
individual risks, countries or guarantee contracts; and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGA's&#13;
expected recovery rates on its total portfolio. However, given the lack of historical claims&#13;
experience in MIGA, there is no actuarial or historical basis upon which to determine the&#13;
Agency's expected claims experience. Accordingly, management, with the approval of&#13;
the Board, relies on a premium-based methodology for establishing the reserve for claims&#13;
(see Note F).&#13;
Recognizing the fact that during the early years of the Agency's operations when its cash&#13;
reserves are small in relation to its obligations assumed under its insurance activities and&#13;
when there is limited history for estimation of losses, it is understood, in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the Convention, that the promissory note portion of the subscribed capital&#13;
would be utilized to pay any claims in excess of the cash reserve. In this context, member&#13;
capital remains subject to direct risk. Considering the absence of historical claims experi-&#13;
ence, this risk is difficult to assess. However, it should be noted that under an extreme hypo-&#13;
thetical claims scenario, this risk could be considerable.&#13;

NOTE D: GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND CONTINGENT&#13;
LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantee Program. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncom-&#13;
mercial risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in devel-&#13;
oping member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different&#13;
categories of risk: currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of&#13;
contract. Currency transfer protects the investor from inconvertibility of local currency re-&#13;
turns and proceeds from the liquidation of the investment project into foreign exchange for&#13;
transfer outside the host country. Expropriation protects the investor against partial or total&#13;
loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the host government which may reduce&#13;
or elirninate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil&#13;
disturbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disap-&#13;
pearance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in&#13;
the host country. Breach of contract protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain&#13;
or to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the&#13;
host government. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the four types of&#13;
coverage. MIGA guarantees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated&#13;
unilaterally by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance.&#13;
Premium rates applicable to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all&#13;
claims under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under&#13;
the guarantee.&#13;
As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggre-&#13;
gate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by the Agency is 350 percent of&#13;
the sum of the Agency's unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such portion of&#13;
the insurance ceded by the Agency through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Direc-&#13;
tors may determine. Accordingly, at June 30, 1997, the maximum level of guarantees out-&#13;
standing may not exceed $4,234,722,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guaran-&#13;
tees issued and outstanding at June 30, 1997 totaled $2,498,863,000 ($2,276,953,000 -&#13;
June 30,1996). The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum expo-&#13;
sure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed&#13;
but not currently at risk. At June 30, 1997, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insur-&#13;
ance claims exclusive of standby coverage is $1,634,664,000 ($1,547,221,000 - June 30,&#13;
1996). At June 30, 1997, approximately 69 percent of the contingent liability represents&#13;
guarantees issued which will expire in or after fiscal year 2007.&#13;
The composition of the contingent liability including "current' and 'standby" coverage under&#13;
guarantees issued and outstanding by host country and by guarantee currency is summarized&#13;
on the following page:&#13;

MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
As of June 30, 1997, additional guarantee capacity amounting to $10,000,000 has been&#13;
committed ($44,000,000 - June 30,1996).&#13;
Claim Acti viy. As of June 30,1997, there have been no claims lodged with the Agency. Two&#13;
disputes were reported during the previous fiscal year between insured investors and their&#13;
host governments. Both disputes were resolved.&#13;
NOTE E: REINSURANCE&#13;
MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance to augrnent its underwriting capacity&#13;
and to protect portions of its insurance portfolio. Although MIGA obtains reinsurance, it&#13;
remains responsible to the insured client for the entire amount of the insurance contract. Of&#13;
the $2,498,863,000 total contingent liability at June 30, 1997, $279,897,000 was ceded&#13;
through contracts of reinsurance ($75,469,000 - June 30, 1996).&#13;
MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsur-&#13;
ance. As of June 30, 1997, total insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official invest-&#13;
ment insurers, amounted to $136,204,000 ($148,532,000 - June 30, 1996).&#13;

NOTE F: RESERVE FOR CLAIMS&#13;
At June 30, 1997, MIGA's reserve for claims totaled $55,192,000 ($33,523,000 - June 30,&#13;
1996). Management is developing a new process for evaluating and measuring the required&#13;
level of daims reserves. The objective will be to relate the level of provisioning mnore directly&#13;
to an evaluation of past loss experience, the composition and volume of the guarantees out-&#13;
standing and to worldwide economic and political conditions as described in Note A. Imple-&#13;
mentation of such a process could significantly increase the level of reserves for claims and&#13;
provision for losses. No estimate of the possible impact has been made as of June 30, 1997&#13;
and, accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do not reflect the new estimation&#13;
process.&#13;

NOTE G: STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (Plan) covering substantially&#13;
all of the staff of the Agency, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(IBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Under the Plan, benefits are based&#13;
on the years of contributory service and the highest three-year average of pensionable remu-&#13;
neration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable&#13;
remuneration, and the World Bank Group contributing the remainder of the actuarially de-&#13;
termined cost of future Plan benefits. The actuarial present values of Plan obligations through-&#13;
out the fiscal year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's actuary.&#13;
The total contribution of the Agency is based upon the aggregate funding method. All con-&#13;
tributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for the purposes of the Plan are&#13;
held separately from the other assets and income of the World Bank Group and can be used&#13;
only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities&#13;
to them have been paid or provided for. Plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed&#13;
income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and other investments.&#13;
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the World Bank Group reevaluated its pension&#13;
expense estimate. Pursuant to this reevaluation, the Agency recorded pension income of&#13;
$940,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 ($750,000 pension expense - June 30,&#13;
1996) in administrative and other expenses relating to its allocation of the pension income&#13;
(pension expense).&#13;
Management fees paid to IBRD in respect of the Plan for the fiscal year ended June 30,1997&#13;
were $271,000 ($221,000 - June 30, 1996).&#13;
NOTE H: RETIRED STAFF BENEFITS PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) that provides certain health&#13;
care and life insurance benefits to retirees of the Agency, the IBRD and IFC. All staff who are&#13;
enrolled in the insurance programs while in active service and who meet certain require-&#13;
ments are eligible for benefits when they reach early or normal retirement age while work-&#13;
ing for the World Bank Group.&#13;
Retirees contribute a level amount toward life insurance based on the amount of coverage.&#13;
Retiree contributions to'ward health care are based on length of service and age at retire-&#13;
ment. The World Bank Group annually contributes the remainder of the actuarially deter-&#13;
mined cost of future benefits. The actuarial present values of RSBP obligations throughout&#13;
the fiscal year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the RSBP's actuary. All&#13;
contributions to the RSBP and all other assets and income held for purposes of the RSBP are&#13;
held separately from the other assets and income of the World Bank Group and can be used&#13;
only for the benefit of the participants in the RSBP and their beneficiaries until all liabilities&#13;
to them have been paid or provided for. RSBP assets consist primarily of fixed income and&#13;
equity securities.&#13;
The total expense allocated to the Agency and included in administrative and other expenses&#13;
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 is $301,000 ($263,000 - June 30, 1996).&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 52 through 65 of this Report&#13;
present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial&#13;
position of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) at June 30, 1997 and&#13;
1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in&#13;
conformity with International Accounting Standards and with generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility&#13;
of management of MIGA; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial&#13;
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accor-&#13;
dance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Standards on&#13;
Auditing, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-&#13;
ance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit&#13;
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in&#13;
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant esti-&#13;
mates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&#13;
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;
As discussed in Notes A and F, Reserve for Claims, MIGA relies on a premium-based&#13;
methodology for establishing the reserve for claims due to the lack of historical claims&#13;
experience. Management is developing a new process for determining the required level&#13;
of claims reserves more directly linked to the evaluation of guarantees outstanding and&#13;
other factors; this could significantly increase the level of such reserves. No estimate of&#13;
the impact has been-made and, accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do&#13;
not reflect the new estimation process. In accordance with the MIGA Convention, the&#13;
promissory demand note portion of the subscribed capital would be utilized to pay any&#13;
claims in excess of the reserve for claims plus retained earnings subjecting member capi-&#13;
tal to direct risk which, under an extreme adverse claims scenario, could be considerable.&#13;
