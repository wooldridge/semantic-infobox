Key Role for Trade Finance in Transition&#13;
and Developing Economies&#13;
Yung Whee Rhee&#13;
Trade finance should get high priority   While domestic trade (including import&#13;
in countries adopting market-oriented   substitution activities) also needs trade&#13;
reforms. It is less risky than other     finance, export-related trade should be&#13;

            Key role for trade finance in transition
            and developing economies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Trade finance should get high priority
            in countries adopting market-oriented reforms. It is less
            risky than other kinds of finance because it is
            trade-transaction-based, self-liquidating, and short-term
            working capital financed. Because of these unique features,
            it can play a critical and catalytic role in the early
            stages of trade, enterprise, banking sector, and
            macroeconomic reforms. This Note explains why trade finance,
            particularly trade finance based on short-term export
            letters of credit, can play such a key developmental role.
            The Note also recommends an appropriate sequence for the
            provision and strengthening of trade-finance-related
            institutions and credit instruments. It concludes that in
            many low-income countries and formerly nonmarket economies,
            it is necessary to institutionalize trade finance based on
            export letters of credit. This lays the foundation for
            market-based and bank-credit-based trade finance, which can
            emerge when the capacity of commercial banks to internalize
            risk-taking is sufficiently developed. Without early
            institutionalization, trade finance cannot play its key
            developmental role.
