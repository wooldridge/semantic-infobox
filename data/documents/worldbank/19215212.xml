international financial institutions ("IFIs"), donors and affected government agencies:&#13;
(a)    Activities to support and develop post-disaster assessments of damage, loss and&#13;
needs; and&#13;
(b)    Advisory and analytical work related to developing and implementing integrated&#13;

2.     Process for calling, receiving and disbursing funds of the Callable Funds for SRFF&#13;
2.1    Calls for funds for the Callable Funds for SRFF are made by the GFDRR Secretariat (as&#13;
defined in the GFDRR Charter) with respect to specific natural disasters. One or more Calls may&#13;
be made at different stages following such disaster. With respect to each affected country, the&#13;
initial Call will be supported by a request from one or more of the following: (i) the local&#13;
government, (ii) the UN Resident Coordinator, (iii) a mission of bilateral donors to that country,&#13;
(iv) a World Bank department routed through the World Bank Country Director of that country,&#13;
and (v) a member of the GFDRR Consultative Group (as hereinafter defined).&#13;
2.2    Following an initial Call for a natural disaster, any additional Calls will be made by in the&#13;
discretion of the GFDRR Secretariat based on initial post-disaster assessments and&#13;
recommendations from national authorities for financing gaps in priority recovery needs.&#13;
2.3    Donors that are willing to provide funds will confirm their intent in response to a Call&#13;
through signature of the Called Funds Confirmation provided by the Bank, as trustee of the&#13;
Callable Funds for SRFF, for that purpose. Confirmed funds will be provided by the donor&#13;
immediately following signature.&#13;

Callable Fund. Requests for funding may be made to the GFDRR Secretariat by any entity,&#13;
including local governments, UN agencies and IFIs. The GFDRR Secretariat may, in its&#13;
discretion, base its decision to provide funding for a certain activity on the provision by the&#13;
recipient or beneficiary entity of an Arrangement stating its willingness to commit to certain&#13;

national authorities for post disaster assessments will be viewed more favorably and&#13;
funded more readily than efforts with limited participation.&#13;
b) Track records in disaster work, such that prior investments in disaster prevention and&#13;
preparedness programs will be viewed more favorably and will strengthen requests for&#13;
funding of post-disaster recovery and mitigation programs. A self-assessment report&#13;
outlining the disaster prevention and preparedness programs undertaken, will be required&#13;
to be submitted to the GFDRR Secretariat every time a request is made for post-disaster&#13;
recovery financing.&#13;

operating costs provided under recipient-executed activities. If a proposed recipient does not&#13;
have sufficient capacity to meet the Bank's fiduciary requirements or to implement the funds in&#13;
an effective and efficient manner under the circumstances, the GFDRR Secretariat may ask one&#13;
or more specialized UN agencies or IFIs to execute these activities on behalf of the intended&#13;
recipient.&#13;
