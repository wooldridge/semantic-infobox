STATE HEALTH SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:        India, acing by its President&#13;
Beneficiaries:   States of Kaatka, Punjab, West Bengal and Punjab Health Systems Corporation&#13;
(PHSC)&#13;
Amount:          IDA Credit SDR 235.5 million (US$350.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Poverty:         Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). This project is classified as a PTI because a&#13;
large proportion of project beneficiaries will be from the poor and vulnerable segments&#13;
of the states' population. In Karnataka and West Bengal, about two-thirds of expected&#13;
project beneficiaries would belong to the lowest 40% of the population in terms of&#13;
income distribution. In Punjab, a relatively large share of the investment under the&#13;
project would be targeted in the Upper Bari Doab and rural Southem Malwa regions&#13;
where 30% and 25% respectively of the overall population live below the poverty line.&#13;
Terms:           IDA Standard, with 35 years maturity&#13;
On-Lending Tenns: The Goverment of India would make the proceeds of the Credit available to the States of&#13;
Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal under standard arrangements for development&#13;
assistance to the States of Idia; Punjab would further transfer the funds to PHSC as a&#13;
grant GOI would assume foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Descridtion:     The project would be implemented in Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal. It would&#13;
be an investment loan with policy reform in areas of resource allocation for the health&#13;
sector, capacity development for sector analysis and management strengthening,&#13;
enhance participation of the private and voluntary sectors in the delivery of health&#13;
services, and implementation of user charges for those who can afford to pay. The&#13;
project would finance investment related to three main activities:&#13;
(i) Management Development and Institutional Strengthening: (a) improving the&#13;
institutional framework for policy development; (b) strengthening the management and&#13;
implementation capacity of institutions; and (c) developing a surveillance capacity&#13;
for major communicable diseases and response capabilities; (ii) Improving Service&#13;
Quality. Access and Effectiveness at the First Referral Level, through: (a) upgrading&#13;
community, subdivisional and  district hospitals; (b) upgrading the effectiveness&#13;
of clinical and support services through streamlining of norms and provision of&#13;
training, management information system, waste management and support services;&#13;
and (c) improving the referral mechanism and strengthening linkages with the primary&#13;
and tertiary health care levels; and (iii) Improving Access to Primary Health Care in&#13;
Remote and Underdeveloped areas: (a) upgrading primary health centers in the&#13;
Sunderban area of West Bengal; and (b) increasing access to primary care services&#13;
among the SC/ST population in Karnataka.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi&#13;
Bernfits:       In addition to systemic benefits which would indirectly benefit the population of the&#13;
states of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal, the project would directly benefit&#13;
approximately 10 million out-patients and 0.7 million in-patients currently utilizing&#13;
existing hospital services in the three states through the provision of better quality of&#13;
health services. The project is expected to directly benefit an estimated 5.2 million&#13;
incremental out-patients and an estimated 0.8 million incremental in-patients in the three&#13;
states. A major benefit of the proposed project would be to assist the states of&#13;
Karnataka, West Bengal and Punjab to put in place a coherent approach to establishing&#13;
a cost-effective and sustainable health system. This would indirectly benefit the states'&#13;
population as a whole. First, the broader sectoral policy reform envisaged under the&#13;
project would increase the efficiency of the health sector by improving the environment&#13;
in which the health sector operates. Second, there would be substantial cost savings in&#13;
each state through the implementation of strean-line&amp; s.-vice norns and rationalization&#13;
of service provision at different levels of the systtrn.  The technical and quality&#13;
improvements, i ic uding operations and maintenance functions, at the institutional and&#13;
health facility levels would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of health care&#13;
services by encouraging patients to seek timely care, resulting in higher cure rates at&#13;
lower costs. Third, patients currently utilizing existing services would benefit from&#13;
better quality services. Other qualitative benefits would be: the enhanced credibility and&#13;
vital support to the primary health care system through the strengthening of first referral&#13;
facilities; and externalities associated with improvements in waste disposal methods and&#13;
surveillance systems for major communicable diseases. Finally, the proposed project&#13;
would have a direct long-term impact on improving the health status of the people of&#13;
each state and would thus contribute to increasing the earning potential of the poor.&#13;
Risks:          The proposed project carries several risks that have affected, to varying degrees, PHN&#13;
projects in India. These include poor procurement, late disbursement, untimely and&#13;
inadequate flow of funds, poor maintenance of buildings and equipment, and inadequate&#13;
attention to software and qualitative aspects. Most of these risks have been substantially&#13;
reduced through careful project design. There are two additional risks associated with&#13;
this project. Institutional. The capacity of existing institutions to undertake systemic&#13;
improvements and to establish a more rational health delivery system has not been tested&#13;
in India.  Institutional strengthening, including strengthening of the managemnent&#13;
structure in all three states would be emphasized in the proposed project to&#13;
address this risk. In Punjab, the newly established PHSC might initially have some&#13;
start-up problems. The Government of Punjab, at the highest level, has made a&#13;
commitment to enable the PHSC to effectively implement the Project. Financial. As&#13;
with other projects in India, the overall financial status of the states is a risk. The&#13;
position of public finances in Karnataka and recent trends in expenditure on health both&#13;
suggest that the projects' incremental recurrent costs are sustainable. In Punjab. the&#13;
necessary resources needed to sustain this commitment can be mobilized with a small&#13;
increase in revenue. In West Bengal, some reorientation of its fiscal policies may be&#13;
required to ensure sustainability. To help reduce the risk to financial sustainability, an&#13;
on-going mechanism for monitoring overall state finances as well as the financial&#13;
situation of the health sector would be undertaken through a comprehensive mid-term&#13;
review. If necessary, additional measures to achieve financial sustainability of project&#13;
benefits would be agreed upon based on that review.&#13;

STATE HEALTH SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I&#13;
L STATE/SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Health Sector in India&#13;
1.1   Introduction. During the past two decades, India has developed a health care system in which&#13;
the Government sector finances and manages a basic health care infrastructure, while the private sector&#13;
predominantly provides ambulatory care services. Substantial gaps, however, remain in the effective&#13;
delivery of health care, especially for the poorest sections of the population. Key health indicators&#13;
show that the health status of India's population remains low. Communicable diseases continue to be&#13;
major health problems; maternal mortality is high; acute respiratory and diarrheal diseases account for&#13;
a large proportion of childhood mortality; and preventable mortality and morbidity, especially among&#13;
the poor, exact a high toll. Moreover, with the increasing age profile of its population, India is moving&#13;
into an epidemiological transition with the double burden of significant communicable diseases and&#13;
increasing non-commuaicable diseases such as cardio-vascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and cataract&#13;
blindness.&#13;
1.2    Health Policy. The Eighth Plan (1992-1997) identified health as one of the six priority areas,&#13;
and determined that public investments in health are critical for human resource development and&#13;
poverty alleviation in India. India's long term strategy for health sector development is enunciated in&#13;
the National Health Policy (NHP) of 1983. Public policy for health has been based on an implicit&#13;
assumption that primnary health care is a basic right to which people should not be denied access due to&#13;
inability to pay or for other socio-economic reasons. The NHP emphasizes the role of the state in&#13;
providing basic health care, through the development of publicly run health facilities and draws&#13;
attention to the strengthening of cooperation between the public and private sectors. The NHP gives&#13;
high priority to the control of fertility, infectious diseases of public health importance and preventable&#13;
causes of maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity. This is an appropriate health policy given&#13;
India's burden of disease (see Annex 1). However, investment allocations do not fully reflect the&#13;
priorities highlighted in the government's health policy and implementation of health programs&#13;
continues to be weak.&#13;
1.3    Health Care Financing. In 1991, total health spending in India accounted for about 6 percent&#13;
of GDP, or about US$13 per capita per year. Of this, Government contributions including center,&#13;
states and municipalities account for about 20% of total health spending or 1.3% of GDP. Private&#13;
health spending accounts for the remaining 80%. As a percentage of GDP, total health spending is&#13;
higher than in other Asian countries which are at about India's level of per capita income. However,&#13;
the percentage of Government to total health spending in India is lower than in comparable Asian&#13;
countries. There is also a difference in the type of health services provided in the public and private&#13;
sectors. Public provided services are the dominant source of preventive health care, such as&#13;
inmunization, ante-natal care, and infectious disease control services, in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Private providers are dominant in the provision of ambulatory care for acute illnesses, or illnesses not&#13;
requiring hospitalization. Moreover, private health spending is almost entirely from out-of-pocket&#13;
sources, and health insurance is insignificant and limited in scope. This places a disproportionate&#13;
burden on the poor.&#13;
1.4    The structure of Government's financing of the health sector is quite complex. Under the&#13;
federal structure of the Indian Union, public provision of health services is primarily the responsibility&#13;
of the state governments. The center, however, exercises its discretion to initiate and fully or partially&#13;
finance centrally-financed schemes through a mechanism of specific grants to the states. The state&#13;
governments retain responsibility for implementing such schemes. Public financing of health at the&#13;
central and state levels is influenced by the planning process which takes place within the framework of&#13;
central and state five-year plans. Within this structure of Government spending, states spend about&#13;
87%, the center about 10%, and municipalities account for the remaining 3%. A large component of&#13;
public spending on health is directed towards tertiary care and medical education, and on public health&#13;
interventions that are not the highest priority. The share of salaries in the health budget has continued&#13;
to increase, and recent sector work indicates that it accounts for 70-80% of funds targeted to the health&#13;
sector. As a result, the share of non-salary recurrent costs has fallen and operation and maintenance of&#13;
health programs continue to suffer. As a result, the total amount of resources available for high&#13;
priority, cost-effective health services is small.&#13;
1.5    The capacity of the health care system in India to effectively address the short- and long-term&#13;
health care needs of the country remains limited. The country needs to be prepared to deal with the&#13;
evolving burden of disease in the next decade and to put in place a sustainable health system which&#13;
would combine elements of public health and clinical services in providing an adequate and necessary&#13;
package of basic health services. This package of basic health care services would integrate primary&#13;
health care with secondary level or first referral hospitals.' The emphasis on the first referral facilities&#13;
at the state level in the proposed project is to complement the existing investments in primary care&#13;
infrastructure and provide vital support to primary health care services and the rest of the health sector.&#13;
In addition, a program of health sector policy reform needs to be initiated to provide the general&#13;
firamework for health sector development. These changes need to take place within the context of state&#13;
health systems and will provide technical effectiveness and improved quality of health care.&#13;
B. The States of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal&#13;
1.6    The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal have expressed early commitment to&#13;
undertake health reform. Based on several workshops, presentations and project proposals from about&#13;
10 states, these three states have been included in the proposed project since they are ahead of the&#13;
others in developing a package of policy reform. In addition, West Bengal has been chosen because of&#13;
the high level of poverty in large areas of the state and Punjab because it can set an example for other&#13;
states in areas of policy reform. These states also provide an interesting geographical, cultural and&#13;
I The terms first referral and secondary level hospitals are used synonymously in this report. They denote&#13;
community/rural hospitals that have a bed strength of about 30-50 beds; area/taluka hospitals that have&#13;
about 75-100 beds; sub-divisional/State General hospitals that have about 100-350 beds; and district&#13;
hospitals that have about 300-550 beds. The level of services offered increase from community to area to&#13;
sub-divisional to districts hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
ethnic diversity. Furthermore, the administrative capacity to undertake a project of this type is&#13;
relatively strong in these states. The reason for combining the three states under one project is that they&#13;
will share common elements that are key to the functioning of health systems, such as service norms,&#13;
training, referral systems, surveillance systems for major communicable diseases, equipment&#13;
management systems, quality assurance and information, education and communication (IEC)&#13;
networks. The implementation of the project in each state would be mutually beneficial for lesson&#13;
learning and sharing of experience with respect to these key elements. A brief description of the health&#13;
status and burden of disease in Karnataka, West Bengal and Punjab, which have a combined&#13;
population of about 140 million people (1995), follows.&#13;
1.7    Health Status and Epidemiology in the Three States: Karnataka. The state of Kamataka,&#13;
covering an area of 191,791 square kilometers, is located in the southwest part of India. The&#13;
population in 1995 was about 48 million, with urban areas accounting for about 31 percent of the&#13;
population. Both in terms of area and population, Karnataka ranks eighth among the states of India.&#13;
The state is divided into twenty districts which are grouped into four Revenue Divisions with&#13;
headquarters at Bangalore, Belgaum, Gulbarga and Mysore. Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled&#13;
Tribes (ST) formed 16.4 and 4.0 percent respectively of the population. According to the 1991 census,&#13;
the literacy rate was 67 percent among males and 44 percent among females, which is marginally&#13;
higher than the country average. In 1991, the last year for which consistent estimates across states are&#13;
available, the per capita income was US$329 equivalent, compared to the per capita average for India&#13;
of US$330. 32% of the population is below the poverty line compared to about 33% for India as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
1.8    Karnataka is performing slightly better than the national average in terms of health status and&#13;
epidemiological profile. In Karnataka, the birth rate of 26.3, death rate of 8 and infant mortality rate of&#13;
67 per thousand live births compares to the national averages of 29.3, 9.8 and 80 per thousand live&#13;
births respectively. In the last decade, the number of patients admitted to government hospitals has&#13;
increased by 60 percent, putting a great deal of pressure on hospital facilities. State level&#13;
epidemiological data indicate that injury and poisoning (19.9%) are among the leading causes of&#13;
morbidity, followed by infectious and parasitic diseases (16.3%); diseases of the respiratory system&#13;
(14.50%); and complications of pregnancy and childbirth (11.1%). During the period 1982-92, the&#13;
increase in in-patients has been greatest for the treatment of infectious diseases, neoplasm, endocrine,&#13;
nutritional and metabolic diseases; immunity disorders; complications due to pregnancy and&#13;
puerperium; and injuries and poisoning. The burden of disease in Karnataka reflects the initial phase&#13;
of the health transition taking place during the late 80's and early 90's. On the one hand, selected&#13;
health indicators, such as infant mortality, neonatal and post natal mortality and stillbirth rates, have&#13;
deteriorated; on the other hand, injuries and trauma are increasing.&#13;
1.9    West Bengal. West Bengal, situated in eastern India, is bound by Bangladesh, Nepal and&#13;
Bhutan, and covers an area of about 88,700 square kilometers. With a total population of 72 million in&#13;
1995, it is the most densely populated state in India (810 per square kilometer). 39% of the population&#13;
is below 15 years of age, and about 28% is urban. The large rural population is mainly agricultural,&#13;
with a predominance of small and marginal farmers. It is estimated that more than 30% of the rural&#13;
population lives below the poverty line. ST and SC constitute 5.6% and 23.6% of the population,&#13;
respectively. The literacy rate is about 58%, with a large urban-rural differential. The state is divided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
into 17 districts, with 344 community blocks. In 1991, the per capita income was US$294 equivalent,&#13;
with 28% of the population below the poverty line.&#13;
1.10 In terms of selected health indicators, West Bengal is better off than the average Indian state,&#13;
with a birth rate of 25.6, death rate of 7.3 and infant mortality rate of 58 per thousand live births. A&#13;
recent study indicated the following burden of disease: obstetric and gynecological (23%); gastro-&#13;
intestinal diseases (12%); cardiovascular diseases (9%/o); pulmonary diseases (10%/6); muskuloskeletal&#13;
diseases (9%/6); accidents and injury (9%/6); urinary diseases (8%); skin diseases (7%/6) and neonatal&#13;
diseases (6%). More than 50% of the burden of disease is attributable to matenal and child health and&#13;
communicable diseases, indicating that the health transition has not yet begun in West Bengal.&#13;
1.11   Punjab. The state of Punjab is situated in the north-westem part of India and covers an area of&#13;
131,015 square kilometers, with a population of 21.9 million (1995). 29% of the population lives in&#13;
urban areas. The state is divided into 14 districts, grouped into three regional divisions, with&#13;
headquarters at Firozpur, Patiala and Jalandhar. According to the 1991 census, the average literacy&#13;
rate for the state is about 59%, and the sex ratio is 882 females per thousand males compared to the&#13;
national average of 927 females per thousand males. In 1991, the per capita income was US$554&#13;
equivalent, and only 12% of the state's population was below the poverty line. However, as in other&#13;
states, there is substantial regional variation in per capita income. The Upper Bari Doab area, in the&#13;
northwest comer of the state, has 30% of its population below the poverty line; rural poverty is most&#13;
pervasive in the Upper Bari Doab area, and Southern Malwa, where 40% and 25%, respectively, are&#13;
below the poverty line.&#13;
1.12   Punjab has a birth rate of 27.7, a death rate of 7.8 and an infant mortality rate of 53 per&#13;
thousand live births. The 1992 Survey of Cause of Death (rural) shows that fevers resulting from&#13;
infective conditions (24%) were the leading cause of death followed by circulatory system disorders&#13;
(17%), degenerative conditions (17%), trauma (11%) and respiratory disorders (11%). In terms of&#13;
outpatients seen at medical institutions, the Annual Dispensary Report also shows that 76 percent of&#13;
the disease burden is due to non-communicable diseases; acute respiratory infection is the other major&#13;
disease burden at 17 percent. These figures, when compared to other Indian states, reflect the health&#13;
transition underway in Punjab.&#13;
1.13   Organization of the Public Health Care System. The public health system in Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal corsi:ts of three tiers. At the bottom are primary health care facilities where&#13;
basic health services are provided, with emphasis on preventive and pfomotive aspects such as family&#13;
planning, maternal and child health (MCH), treatment of minor ailments, malarial treatment and&#13;
spraying, sanitation, and public health education. This level includes, in Karnataka, 1,875 Primary&#13;
Health Centers (PHCs) and Primary Health Units (PHUs); in Punjab, 1,462 subcenters, 484 PHCs and&#13;
104 Community Health Centers (CHCs); in West Bengal, 914 PHCs and 249 Block PHCs. The&#13;
management of this level of health care in West Bengal and Punjab is under the Directorate of Health&#13;
Services. In Karnataka, however, family planning and MCH services are under the Directorate of&#13;
Family Welfare.&#13;
1.14  In the middle are the first referral hospitals or secondary level hospitals, consisting of hospitals&#13;
of various bed strengths, ranging generally between 30 and 550 beds, at community, area,&#13;
subdivisional and district levels. These first referral hospitals provide in-patient and out-patient care&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
with diagnostic and treatment facilities not available at the primary level. This level includes, in&#13;
Karnataka, 239 community, sub-divisional and district hospitals (a total of 14,858 beds); in Punjab,&#13;
217 community, sub-divisional and district hospitals (a total of 6,745 beds); and in West Benal 175&#13;
community, sub-divisional, state general and district hospitals (a total of 19,964 beds). This level of&#13;
health care is managed by the Directorate of Health Services. The provision of services at the first&#13;
referral level is inadequate in all three states and this tier does not provide the critical support needed at&#13;
the primary level.&#13;
1.15   At the top of the health structure are the tertiary hospitals, including teaching hospitals, which&#13;
are staffed and equipped to provide more specialized treatments and generally have a capacity&#13;
exceeding 750 beds, with some variations across states. This level includes, in Karnataka, 17 teaching&#13;
hospitals; in Punjab, 3 teriary hospitals; and in West Bengal, 13 teaching hospitals. In addition, each&#13;
state has other specialized hospitals such as TB hospitals, mental hospitals, infectious disease hospitals&#13;
and leprosy hospitals. They are managed by the Directorate of Medical Education. In addition to the&#13;
three major Directorates mentioned above, there are other smaller Directorates within the Department&#13;
of Health and Family Welfare and these vary across states. In Karnataka, for example, there is also a&#13;
Directorate of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy, and the Drug Controller.&#13;
1.16   Utilization of Health Services. The national sample survey (NSS) utilization data from the&#13;
42nd round show that an overwhelning majority of households utilized the allopathic systen of&#13;
medicine both for hospitalization (98%) and ambulatory care (96%). The preference for the allopathic&#13;
system was universal and not influenced by household characteristics such as income, social class or&#13;
literacy. Public hospitals appear to be more often utilized both in rural and urban areas. For example,&#13;
in West Bengal, 77% and 73% of hospitalized cases utilized public hospitals in rural and urban areas,&#13;
respectively. About 8% utilized private hospitals and nursing homes in rural areas, and 24% in urban&#13;
areas. Despite some regional and rural/urban variations, occupancy rates at first referral hospitals are&#13;
close to 100% in West Bengal and between 60-70% in Karnataka and Punjab. Among ST households,&#13;
utilization of public hospitals was much lower; and ST households choose private hospitals much less&#13;
compared to other household groups. About 95% of govenmment services were free (although there&#13;
were indirect costs to the individual) compared to only 7% of services in the private sector. Of the&#13;
kinds of ailments treated by the private sector, preliminary analysis suggest that 35% of cases treated&#13;
were related to child birth, 30-40% were fevers and injuries and 20-30% were for surgery.&#13;
1.17   Beneficiary assessment studies show that Government hospitals, especially first referral&#13;
hospitals, are utilized predominantly by lower income groups. For example, in Karnataka, over 45% of&#13;
the patients have an annual income below Rs. 15,000 (close to the official poverty line) and over 90%&#13;
of the patients have an annual income below the taxable level of Rs. 50,000. Moreover, Government&#13;
facilities are used mainly for treatment of communicable diseases which affect the poor more&#13;
intensively. Those who can afford to pay usually prefer to use private hospitals since the quality of&#13;
services available at Government hospitals is poor, as is the availability of staff, drugs and essential&#13;
supplies (see Annex 14).&#13;
1.18   Public Health Expenditure. The public health care budget was about Rs. 4,872 million in&#13;
Karnataka (FY95), Rs. 5,570 million in West Bengal (FY96) and Rs. 2,202 million in Punjab (FY94).&#13;
In FY94, the share of health and family welfare in the total revenue budget in each state was about&#13;
6.4%, 5.3% and 7.2% respectively. Since FY90, the share of health in the revenue budget has declined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
in Punjab (from 6.6% to 5.3%) and West Bengal (from 8.4% to 7.2%) and has increased marginally in&#13;
Karnataka (from 6.1% to 6.4%). Annual public health expenditure as a percentage of the state's Net&#13;
Domestic Product is only 1.3% in Karnataka, 0.9% in Punjab and 1.2% in West Bengal (see Annex 3).&#13;
1.19   In FY94, about 40% of public health expenditures in Karnataka and West Bengal and about&#13;
60% in Punjab was allocated to the provision of primnary health care services, the largest component of&#13;
which included expenditures on family welfare and programs for the prevention and eradication of&#13;
conmnunicable diseases. Analysis of the composition of public expenditures on health during the last&#13;
five years shows that the budgetary emphasis on primary health care has been maintained.&#13;
1.20   Allocation to public hospitals (secondary and tertiary) in Karnataka in FY95 was about 33%&#13;
of the health budget; in West Bengal, it was 37%; and in Punjab it was about 41%. This analysis of&#13;
subsectoral allocations highlights some important issues. First, the allocation of expenditures for&#13;
hospital services is relatively low in the states, compared to other low income countries. Only 4&#13;
countries in the 29 countries reviewed by Barnum and Kutzin (1993) spent less than 40% of their&#13;
health budget on hospital services. Second, allocations to hospital services in the states, especially at&#13;
the first referral level, have been adversely affected even in years when the overall health budget has&#13;
grown. Third, resource allocations within the hospital sector have been unfavorable to sub-divisional&#13;
and rural/community hospitals.&#13;
1.21   The non-salary recurrent cost budget has been shrinking and the share of salaries of staff have&#13;
increased in recent years (see Annex 3). For example, in West Bengal, salaries and wages accounted&#13;
for about 75% of total expenditures at urban hospitals, and materials and supplies accounted for less&#13;
than 10%. With a rising share of salaries and total allocations remaining constant, the norms for&#13;
expenditure on drugs, supplies and other consumables have been held constant in nominal terms. Since&#13;
price inflation for these commodities have been greater than average, real expenditures on critical&#13;
inputs other than personnel has declined substantially in recent years.&#13;
C. Health Sector Issues in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal&#13;
1.22   Recent sector work on "Policy and Finance Strategies for Strengthening Primary Health Care&#13;
Services" (Report No. 13042-IN, May 1995) recommended that the financing of health care in India&#13;
needs to be increasingly viewed within the context of structural adjustment and stabilization policies&#13;
since the latter are likely to affect government health spending at the central and state levels. Since&#13;
more than 80% of public spending on health is accounted for by the state budgets, and since the states&#13;
are primarily responsible for implementing various health programns, financing and policy reform to&#13;
increase efficiency and improve effectiveness needs to be targeted at the state level. However, the need&#13;
and the challenge for each state can be quite different given the burden of disease, existing public health&#13;
programns, past pattem of public investment in the health sector, the importance and the level of&#13;
involvement of the private sector, the level of poverty etc. In spite of these differences, there are some&#13;
common themes at the state level which emerge as being of equal concem for all states, and which need&#13;
to be addressed.&#13;
1.23   Budgetary/Resource Allocation Issues. Public resources allocated to the health sector in&#13;
Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal from the national, state and municipality budgets are inadequate&#13;
to meet basic health care needs and compare unfavorably to several Asian countries with similar levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
of per capita income. The main problems at the state level, where more than 80% of public funds come&#13;
from the state budgets, are: (i) the relatively small allocation within the state budget to the health&#13;
sector; (ii) the disproportionately high contribution to the tertiary level of health care at the expense of&#13;
first referral facilities and preventive and promotive care services; (iii) the lack of adequate allocations&#13;
for operations and maintenance of investments in the health sector, in particular the size of allocations&#13;
for non-salary recurrent expenditures; and (iv) low level of revenue collection from user charges.&#13;
1.24   Institutional Issues. Institutional weaknesses in the health system result in a low level of&#13;
efficiency. The referral system is largely ineffective; clinical skills at first referral hospitals are below&#13;
standard; and technical support for the primary level of care is weak. Structure of Service Delivery:&#13;
The mechanism for delivering public health services at the state level faces serious problems related to&#13;
the overlapping functions among the various tiers of health care provision. Services provided at&#13;
different tiers of the system are often duplicated, and there is no clear delineation of services at each&#13;
type of facility. Since the first referral hospitals are performing inadequately, tertiary level facilities are&#13;
over-burdened. Moreover, the lower tier institutions such as PHCs are underutilized due to lack of&#13;
technical support (such as treatment and diagnosis) from first referral level institutions. Referral&#13;
Svyst: Institutional and technical linkages for referral between different tiers are weak. It is estimated&#13;
that, with the streamlining of service norms and adequate provision of inputs, a third of all cases which&#13;
are currently treated at tertiary facilities could be adequately treated, and at lower costs, at first referral&#13;
facilities. Surveillance Development and Response Capability: The ability of the public health system&#13;
to cope with unforeseen health emergencies is limited due to weak surveillance and rapid response&#13;
capability. For instance, the plague scare in September-October 1994 exposed the inability of the&#13;
public health system to respond to such events.&#13;
1.25   Management and Planning Issues. Management of facilities at the primary and first referral&#13;
levels is inefficient, especially with regard to the integration of administrative and financial&#13;
responsibilities. There are few incentives for hospitals to improve their management system. The&#13;
capacity to undertake health planning, including the ability to undertake the monitoring of the evolving&#13;
epidemiological profile and the burden of disease, analysis of cost-effective means of achieving the best&#13;
use of limited resources, analysis of the medical manpower situation and monitoring of private health&#13;
sector development at the state level, is inadequate.&#13;
1.26 Technical and Quality Issues. Health facilities at the primary and first referral hospitals in&#13;
the states continue to face operational deficiencies due to general and technical inefficiencies.&#13;
Streamlined clinical and support service norms are not applied at first referral hospitals, as a result of&#13;
which lower tiers of the health system remain underutilized. Support services and infrastructure at&#13;
secondary hospitals are inadequate to deliver quality care. Shortages of diagnostic facilities, including&#13;
equipment for perforning laboratory procedures, are common and adversely affect day-to-day&#13;
functioning. Communications networks and transport facilities are inadequate to meet health care&#13;
demand. Shortages of trained personnel in key areas affect quality of services; and inadequate repair&#13;
and maintenance services for machinery and equipment leads to malfunction and frequent breakdowns.&#13;
Furthermore, the quality of services is also affected by the absenteeism of doctors and other medical&#13;
staff in less developed areas of the state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.27   Access to Health Services. According to hospital data, the proportion of hospital users&#13;
belonging to SC/ST groups is commensurate with their proportion in the general population. However,&#13;
considering the poor socio-econornic condition of these groups, and their low nutritional level, the&#13;
morbidity and mortality in this population is greater and warrants a higher utilization of secondary&#13;
hospital services. An additional issue is the low utilization of health services by women. In Karnataka,&#13;
for example, the NSS survey indicates that the sex ratio among hospitalized cases is 786 females for&#13;
1,000 males, whereas the sex ratio in the population is 960 females per 1,000 males. There is a need to&#13;
enhance the utilization of hospital services by women and SC/ST groups by strengthening links&#13;
between primary and secondary levels of care through an effective referral mechanism and reducing the&#13;
physical and psychological distances traveled. Disparities also exist between the urban and rural parts&#13;
of the states with respect to access to health facilities and service quality. The urban based secondary&#13;
hospitals tend to be overcrowded, especially the outpatient facilities, and operate at near full capacity,&#13;
whereas some of the remote rural facilities remain underutilized because they are unable to provide&#13;
even basic services.&#13;
1.28   Role of the Private Sector and NGOs. Detailed information on the scope, quality and size of&#13;
the private sector is not easily available. Recent sector work found that the private sector plays a major&#13;
role in the provision and financing of health care in India. There has been a significant growth of&#13;
private sector facilities in recent years, especially in Punjab and Karnataka. In Punjab 40% of all&#13;
hospital beds are in the private sector; in Karnataka, about 33% of all hospital beds are in the private&#13;
sector; and in West Bengal, private hospitals and nursing homes account for about 23% of hospital&#13;
beds in the state. In all three states, about 80% of all private hospital beds are located in urban areas.&#13;
The private sector comprises a wide range of health providers, ranging from the household doctors in&#13;
the villages to the corporate sector in the cities and charitable hospitals and dispensaries. However,&#13;
many of these providers are unqualified, licensing is weak or non-existent, and quality is varied. Lack&#13;
of regulations and effective legal remedies contributes to inappropriate practices. Government's ability&#13;
to monitor, regulate, register and certify private care providers could be strengthened and there still&#13;
remains scope for expanding the role of the private sector.&#13;
1.29   The role and scope of NGOs in delivering health care services have so far been limited. NGOs&#13;
have a comparative advantage in improving access to health services for some disadvantaged groups in&#13;
remote and rural areas. Opportunities remain for effective NGO participation in service delivery as&#13;
well as behavior changing information, education and communication (IEC) activities.&#13;
D. Lessons from Experience&#13;
1.30   This is the second project in India that involves the health system at the state level. It is more&#13;
broadly based than the on-going or completed population, health and nutrition (PHN) projects in India.&#13;
Even so, the experience of social sector projects in India is varied and extensive enough to provide&#13;
some important lessons for the preparation and implementation of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1.31   There are five completed PHN projects in India for which Project Completion Reports (PCRs)&#13;
or Performance Audit Reports (PARs) are available.2 These are the First, Second, Third and Fourth&#13;
Population projects and the First Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition project. The Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department has also undertaken an Impact Evaluation Report of the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition&#13;
project. Overall, the projects have met an important part of their development objectives. Population I&#13;
and II met most of their aims, but did not have any systemic impact on the Family Welfare program.&#13;
Population III had significant outcomes in Kerala but not in Karnataka. Population IV appears to have&#13;
contributed to very significant improvements in contraceptive prevalence and reduction in infant&#13;
mortality. The Tamil Nadu Nutrition project is well-documented as having a major impact on&#13;
improving the nutritional status of young children.&#13;
1.32   There are currently fourteen on-going PHN projects in India. The list below shows eight that&#13;
are now on-going in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal:&#13;
Health sector: National AIDS Control, National Leprosy Elimination and Cataract&#13;
Blindness projects;&#13;
*     Family Welfare (FW) sector: Population VII, Population VIII, Population IX and&#13;
Child Survival and the Safe Motherhood (CSSM) projects; and&#13;
*     Nutrition sector: First Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS I) project.&#13;
1.33   Despite many positive outcomes, the completed and ongoing projects have suffered to varying&#13;
degrees from a variety of implementation problems. These have included: late start-up, poor&#13;
procurement, slow disbursement, frequent management tumover, untimely and inadequate flow of&#13;
funds, poor maintenance of buildings and equipment, and inadequate attention to software and&#13;
qualitative aspects.&#13;
1.34   The design of the proposed project would take account of the concems and problem areas&#13;
identified above as shown in Table 1.1.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
1.35   In addition, international experience has also been considered in the design and scope of the&#13;
project. The World Development Report (1993) on Investing in Health suggested that a broad sectoral&#13;
approach within a supportive policy environment produces significant positive results and benefits. It&#13;
also suggested that a limited package of public health measures and essential clinical interventions is a&#13;
top priority for government finance. On the components of the public health package, the list includes:&#13;
(i) the expanded program on immunization, including micronutrient supplementation; (ii) school health&#13;
programs to treat worm infection, micronutrient deficiencies and health education; (iii) programs to&#13;
increase public knowledge about family planning, health and nutrition; (iv) programs to reduce&#13;
consumption of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; and (v) AIDS prevention program with a strong STD&#13;
component. On the components of the essential clinical services the list includes: (i) prenatal and&#13;
delivery care; (ii) family planning services (these two components together constitute a Safe&#13;
Motherhood Program); (iii) management of the sick child; (iv) treatment of TB; (v) case management&#13;
of STDs; and (vi) treatment of minor infection and trauma, otherwise known as limited care. This&#13;
project, in recognizing the specific administrative, burden of disease and socio-technical issues in India,&#13;
would provide a number of the services listed above. It would also establish the institutional structure&#13;
that can lead to the provision of some of the other services in the future.&#13;
E. Linkages With Other PHN Projects&#13;
1.36   The proposed project would complement and consolidate investments made by on-going&#13;
projects by providing policy and implementation coordination with other health and FW projects in the&#13;
state. The need for this has also emerged as an important lesson of experience. For example, the&#13;
strengthening of the first level referral for obstetrics and child care in this project through the provision&#13;
of essential clinical and diagnostic services would complement the primary level of services being&#13;
provided under Population VII, Population VIl:, Population IX and CSSM projects. In addition, the&#13;
actions of these on-going projects with regard to initiating a referral system from the community to the&#13;
community hospital level, providing equipment at the first level referral for obstetrics units and defining&#13;
the facilities needed for emergency obstetrics care will be further strengthened under this project by&#13;
putting in place a referral system that will be able to link up preventive and curative aspects of health&#13;
services. These complementary curative actions, which are somewhat higher level interventions than&#13;
the preventive and promotive primary care services provided by on-going projects, will improve the&#13;
health status of women and children and reduce fertility. Similarly, this project will complement the&#13;
AIDS Control and Leprosy Elimination projects by enhancing the physical facilities located in the&#13;
states that are providing services under the national programs. The same is true of the complementarity&#13;
with the Cataract Blindness project. Where the blindness wards are located in the district hospitals in&#13;
the states, the project will upgrade the clinical and diagnostic activities of those facilities.&#13;

F. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement&#13;
1.37      The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for India (May 19, 1995; Report No.&#13;
14509-IN) supports GOI's efforts to provide an enabling enviromnent for broad-based, efficient private&#13;
sector-led growth while accelerating the development of human resources. In the human resource sectors,&#13;
the strategy is to enhance access to basic services for the poor and to support well-targeted safety net&#13;
programs that protect the most vulnerable groups in Indian society. As part of this approach, the Bank's&#13;
strategy in the health sector is to assist India to reduce the level of mortality, morbidity and disability&#13;
through a two-pronged approach. The first is to reduce the burden of the most significant diseases&#13;
through the support of priority programs; the second is to strengthen the performance of state health&#13;
systems to deal with the evolving burden of disease by providing more efficient and effective health care.&#13;
The basis of this strategy for the health sector in India is rooted in an on-going dialogue between GOI and&#13;
IDA, and is reflected in recent sector work, "India: Policy and Finance Strategies for Strengthening&#13;
Primary Health Care Services", May 1995.&#13;
1.38      IDA investment in the proposed project is justified for the following reasons. First, the project&#13;
is consistent with IDA's strategy of strengthening state health systems by optimizing resource use and&#13;
avoiding duplication and wastage. Second, the project would strengthen the states' capacity to implement&#13;
priority health programs and provide basic health care in rural areas. Third, the project would&#13;
consolidate the investments made by a number of other IDA supported projects in the PHN sector, and&#13;
add incremental value to the health care system at the state level. Fourth, the project is in line with the&#13;
overall IDA strategy of poverty reduction in India through its focus on underprivileged people, especially&#13;
women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Finally, the proposed project would assist Karmataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal to establish the foundation for a sustainable and coherent approach to health&#13;
care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Approach&#13;
2.1    The proposed project would be an investment operation with substantial policy content. It will&#13;
assist the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal to put in place a first referral health&#13;
system which would provide vital support and lend credibility to primary health care services and the&#13;
rest of the health sector. The proposed project would be an important step in the development of a&#13;
coherent, efficient and sustainable health system. The project would also strengthen the organizational&#13;
structure of preventive and curative aspects of health care by integrating primary health care services&#13;
with first referral hospitals. An adequate and necessary package of health services would be&#13;
implemented in each state, based on service norms developed, and consistent with the burden of&#13;
disease. Focusing on these key elements would prepare the states to better address priority issues in the&#13;
health sector over the next ten years.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.2    The objectives of the proposed project would be to assist the Governments of Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal to: (i) improve efficiency in the allocation and use of health resources through&#13;
policy and institutional development; and (ii) improve the performance of the health care system&#13;
through improvements in the quality, effectiveness and coverage of health services at the first referral&#13;
level and selective coverage at the primary level to better serve the neediest sections of society. The&#13;
ultimate goal of the project would be to improve the health status of the people, especially the poor, by&#13;
reducing mortality, morbidity and disability. The achievement of the objectives will be evaluated on the&#13;
basis of timely implementation of the policy reform spelled out in the Letters of Health Sector Development&#13;
Program of the three state Governments in Annex 2.&#13;
2.3    The set of development indicators include the following in each state: (a) an increase in each year&#13;
in the share of resources for the primary and secondary levels of health care in the total resources (plan&#13;
and non-plan) allocated to the health sector, until the year 2002; (b) adequate and timely budget&#13;
allocations for recurrent expenditures at the first referral level, in order to meet the resource&#13;
requirements under the project's annual operating plan; (c) adequate budget allocations for provision of&#13;
drugs and essential supplies; and (d) implementation of a user charge policy. The implementation of&#13;
these policy reforms will be monitored during supervision through the review of relevant financial and&#13;
budgetary documents of the Goverrnent, and field visits. These would provide monitorable evidence&#13;
of policy actions in each state and their sustained adherence to key elements of the policy letter.&#13;
2.4   In addition, the achievement of the development objectives would be evaluated on the basis of&#13;
activity and efficiency indicators as well as quality, access and effectiveness indicators as shown in Annex 19&#13;
on Perfbmnance Indicators. These include a number of indicators to monitor interim progress towards the&#13;
achievement of development objectives, summafized below.&#13;
2.5    Activity indicators including tumover rate, bed occupancy and average length of stay, which are&#13;
derived from bed occupancy, cumulative inpatient days and admissions during a given period of time, would&#13;
be measured against the baseline. Efficiency indicators including the following would be measured agamst a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
baseline: clinical services, such as number of major surgeries and deliveries and their percentages to&#13;
admissions during a given time period; diagnostic services, such as number of imaging and electro-medical&#13;
tests and their percentages to admissions during a given time period; non-clinical services such as post-&#13;
mortems, percentage of post-operative case fatalities and percentage of infection acquired at the hospital; and&#13;
emergency service index measures such as emergency outpatient and entry ratios. These efficiency masures&#13;
would be evaluated against the baseline, and compared with the best perfonrmng facilities and against&#13;
comparable international standards.&#13;
2.6    Quality, access and effectiveness indicators including the following vvould be measured: staffing,&#13;
equipment and drug norms met at each facility; inpatient and outpatient waiting time; patient satisfaction;&#13;
upgradation of clinical, management and equipment maintenance skills; awareness among target group of&#13;
services offered; awareness among doctors of how the referral system is expected to function; and funds&#13;
recovered from user charges. Some of these would be measured against the baseline, while others will be&#13;
measured against the norms that were developed during project preparation.&#13;
C. Project Content&#13;
I. The Reform Program&#13;
2.7    The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal have made a commitment to&#13;
improving their health system and establishing the necessary framework to achieve project objectives.&#13;
All three states have taken action to strengthen the implementation and supervision capacity of the&#13;
implementing agency. Punjab has established the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC) which&#13;
was passed as an Ordinance on October 20, 1995. The three states have developed streamlined service&#13;
norms at district, sub-divisional and community hospitals that would result in substantial increases in&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed project would build upon the institutional and policy&#13;
changes initiated by the states of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal. All three state Governments&#13;
have emphasized their commitment to a policy package of health sector reform reflecting key sectoral&#13;
development issues for the primary and first referral levels of health care. Letters of Health Sector&#13;
Development Program provided by the three states are attached in Annex 2. Details of the Reform&#13;
Program are provided below.&#13;
(1) Increase Financing and Improve Resource Allocation for the Health Sector by (a) ensuring adequate&#13;
budgetary allocations to the health sector; (b) increasing the share of health sector resources to the&#13;
primary and secondary levels of health care; and (c) safeguarding the operations and maintenance&#13;
component of the health budget to ensure adequate supplies of drugs and essential medical materials&#13;
and maintenance of equipment and infrastructure;&#13;
(2) Strengthen the Capacity of the Implementing Agency in Sector Analysis and Management by&#13;
(a) setting up a Strategic Planning Cell under the Health Secretary to undertake analyses of health&#13;
sector issues; and (b) strengthening the implementing agency's role and provide it with authority to&#13;
manage essential operational activities including civil works construction and maintenance activities;&#13;
(3) Enhance the Role of the Private and Voluntary Sectors in the Delivery and Management of Health&#13;
Services by (a) contracting-out selected services; and (b) promoting linkages in health care delivery&#13;
with the private and voluntary sectors; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(4) Implement a User Charge Policy by (a) implementing existing user charges more rigorously;&#13;
(b) retaining and using revenue collected; and (c) exempting the poor from user charges.&#13;
(1) Increase Financing and Improve Resource Allocation for the Health Sector&#13;
2.8    Ensuring Adequate Budgetary Allocations to the Health Sector. In FY93, public&#13;
expenditure on health and family welfare, as a percentage of State Domestic Product, in Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal was about 1.3%, 0.9% and 1.1% respectively; as a percentage of the total&#13;
state revenue budget, the contribution of the health budget was 6.4%, 5.3% and 7.2% in Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal respectively (see Annex 3). These contributions are low when compared to&#13;
several Asian countries with similar or even higher levels of income. In Punjab and West Bengal,&#13;
where the rate of growth of health expenditure has been below the overall rate of Government&#13;
expenditure in some years, continuation of recent trends in health expenditure would not be sufficient to&#13;
absorb the incremental costs to meet the basic health care service needs of the population. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal confirmed that they would at&#13;
least maintain the share of health sector allocations within the overall budget at the FY94 level.&#13;
2.9   Increasing the Share of Health Sector Resources to the Primary and First Referral&#13;
Levels. Within the health sector resource allocation is skewed in favor of tertiary care services,&#13;
compared to secondary and primary care services. In particular, resource allocations within the hospital&#13;
sector have been unfavorable to sub-divisional and rural/community hospitals. Moreover, terdary&#13;
hospitals have received a large share of total Plan resources allocated for the hospital sector. First&#13;
referral care has, therefore, traditionally suffered from a low level of public funding. Investments at the&#13;
first referral level would redress some of this imbalance during the implementation years (see Annex 3).&#13;
At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that the&#13;
share of both the primary and secondary levels in the total resources (Plan and Non-plan) allocated for&#13;
the health sector would be increased each year until the year 2002.&#13;
2.10   Safeguarding the Operations and Maintenance Component of the Budgetary Allocations&#13;
for the Secondary Health Sector. The non-salary recurrent cost budget of the health sector overall&#13;
has been shrinking. With total grants remaining more or less constant, a rising share of salaries has&#13;
meant that expenditures on critical inputs other than personnel, such as drugs and essential supplies&#13;
have declined in recent years. Since price inflation for these commodities has been greater than&#13;
average, there has in fact been a decline in real expenditures on non-salary recurrent costs. Moreover,&#13;
during the last two years, even nominal expenditures per bed for drugs and consumables have declined.&#13;
At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that&#13;
they would allocate adequate resources for drugs, essential supplies and maintenance of equipment and&#13;
buildings at first referral hospitals in accordance with norms agreed with IDA.&#13;
(2) Strengthen the Capacity of the Implementation Agency in Sector Analysis and Management&#13;
2.11   Enhancing Capacity for Strategic Planning. A strategic planning cell has been set up in&#13;
each state to address strategic planning issues in the health sector and provide management with policy&#13;
options. It would undertake operational and policy related research projects, either independently or&#13;
through local consultants, and it would organize workshops and seminars. In addition, the strategic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
planning cell would undertake analyses of a number of other equally important health issues including:&#13;
monitoring the role of the private sector and reviewing the suitability of present regulations relating to&#13;
the quality of private care provision; analyzing the evolving epidemiological profile in the states; and&#13;
undertaking of periodic review of the health manpower supply situation and training needs in each&#13;
state. At Negotiations, the Governmnents of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances&#13;
that they would maintain the Strategic Planning Cell with adequate staff, resources, and terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.12   Strengthening the Implementing Agency's Role in Managing Essential Operational&#13;
Activities. A new system of managing essential operational activities, particularly with regard to civil&#13;
works construction and maintenance, has been proposed to successfully implement the large scope and&#13;
volume of activities under the project. This would be achieved by making the DOHFW in Karnataka&#13;
and West Bengal, and the PHSC in Punjab more directly responsible both financially and&#13;
administratively to undertake civil works construction and maintenance activities under the project. At&#13;
Negotiations, the three state Governments provided assurances that they would take all necessary&#13;
actions to ensure that the DOHFW in Karnataka and West Bengal and PHSC in Punjab would provide,&#13;
and thereafter maintain authority to manage essential operational activities such as civil works&#13;
construction and maintenance activities.&#13;
(3) Enhance the Role of the Private and Voluntary Sectors in the Delivery and Management of Health&#13;
Services&#13;
2.13   Contracting-out Selected Services. Private contractual services are often more efficient and&#13;
effective than direct labor. In view of the difficulties of employing government staff, such as slow&#13;
recruitment and poor attendance, contracting-out certain services, especially support services, becomes&#13;
even more attractive. It has been confirmed that there are no legal barriers inhibiting the use of&#13;
contractual services for support functions and that the Contract Labor Regulation and Abolition Act&#13;
(1970), which prohibits certain institutions from contracting-out perennial services, exempt hospitals&#13;
and health care facilities. At Negotiations, an understanding was reached that in order to cut costs and&#13;
increase efficiency, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would review and&#13;
implement, as appropriate, private contractual services, especially supporting services.&#13;
2.14   Linkages with the Private and NGO Sectors. As noted earlier, the private sector has a&#13;
predominant presence in the health sector in the three states, especially in the provision of amnbulatory&#13;
care services. The role of the private sector in health care delivery can be further enhanced in the&#13;
future, provided that the regulatory framework for ensuring the quality of health care provision can be&#13;
appropriately strengthened. The state Governments propose to enhance the participation of the private&#13;
and NGO sectors, especially for improving access to primary health care and first referral services in&#13;
remote and underdeveloped areas of the Sunderbans in West Bengal and for disadvantaged groups,&#13;
particularly SC/STs in Karnataka (see Annex 13). The state Governments are also exploring&#13;
opportunities for contracting out the delivery of health care in remote areas to the NGO sector which&#13;
has a comparative advantage in improving access to such health services for some disadvantaged&#13;
groups. On matters of ensuring the quality of health care provision, state Governments would also play&#13;
a more pro-active role, through legislation such as the Nursing Home Registration Act.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
(4) Implementing a User Charge Policy&#13;
2.15   Implementing Existing User Charges More Rigorously. The health financing sector work&#13;
indicates that the revenue collected in the three states from user charges varies between 3% and 7% of&#13;
the health budget of the states. International experience in developing countries with somewhat higher&#13;
per capita income than India, and where the performance of the public health sector has been relatively&#13;
better, shows that revenue collected from user charges accounts for about 15-20% of the health budget.&#13;
The Governments of the three states recognize the importance of increasing revenue collection through&#13;
user charges for the sustainability of the sector. A major problem in increasing revenue is a lack of&#13;
enforcement in the collection of existing user charges.&#13;
2.16   The system of user charges proposed by each state would be a combination of voluntary&#13;
payments and targeting the poor for exemptions. In order to generate revenue and provide services for&#13;
those willing to pay, district and sub-divisional hospitals will provide private paying bed facilities and&#13;
begin to charge for services in a phased manner after improvements in the quality of basic services and&#13;
infrastructure development have been completed. All three states would ensure that at least 20% of all&#13;
beds at first referral hospitals would be designated as paying beds. It was agreed that user fees would&#13;
be used specifically for non-salary recurrent cost purposes. Enhanced charges would be made effective&#13;
after improved services are provided at each facility. The Governments would institute adequate&#13;
administrative mechanisms for collecting user fees through District Health Committees and through the&#13;
appointment of key staff at the district level who would be responsible for implementing and collecting&#13;
user charges more rigorously (see Annex 5). At Negotiations, the Governments of Kamataka, Punjab&#13;
and West Bengal provided assurances that the arrangements for maintenance and collection of user&#13;
charges would be maintained and user charges would be implemented in a phased manner after&#13;
improvements in the quality of basic services and infrastructure development have been completed.&#13;
2.17   Retention and Use of Revenue Collected. The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West&#13;
Bengal would implement a system that would ensure that funds collected through user charges would&#13;
not revert to the state treasury, where they become part of general revenue. To provide incentives for&#13;
hospitals to collect user charges, all three states would implement a system that would retain the funds&#13;
collected at the institutional level. Funds collected through user charges would be utilized for non-&#13;
salary recurrent cost purposes in all three states. At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka and&#13;
West Bengal provided assurances that in Karnataka and West Bengal, the system established as a&#13;
condition of Negotiations for the retention and reallocation of funds collected at the hospital level, that&#13;
would reallocate funds, on the basis of both need and level of revenue collection by the District Health&#13;
Committees, would be maintained. In Punjab, regulations on user charges would stipulate that funds&#13;
collected would be retained at the point of collection.&#13;
2.18   Exempting the Poor from  User Charges. Given the differences in management and&#13;
administration, income levels and underlying structure of the economy in the three states, the states&#13;
propose to use different criteria for exempting the poor from user charges (see Annex 5). In Karnataka,&#13;
the Govermnent proposes to use the existing green/tricolor card system within the Public Distribution&#13;
System (PDS) in the state, which is used to provide nutritional support through issue of subsidized&#13;
grain, as a basis for exemption from user fees. Green card holders are also entitled to subsidized cloth&#13;
and kerosene. All poor families with an annual income level of Rs. 11,850 or below (i.e., the nationally&#13;
accepted norm under the JRY program) are entitled to such green cards. The number of green card&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
holders in the state are about 5.3 million compared to the 9 million ration card holders of the PDS&#13;
system. Understainding was reached with the Government that it would carefully monitor the green&#13;
card system as a basis for exempting the poor from user fees and ensure that leakages are minimized.&#13;
In Puniab exemptions to the charges would include state government employees and members of&#13;
families holding yellow cards which signify a family income of below Rs. 11,850 based on the JRY&#13;
norms. New lists of families eligible for these cards are being put together. Total revenue raised by&#13;
DOHFW in 1993/94 was Rs. 25 million or just over I percent of expenditure. According to the&#13;
National Sample Survey 1987/88, almost 50 percent of hospitalized cases are in non public hospitals.&#13;
The average payment per case in these institutions was Rs. 1,200, indicating a willingness to pay&#13;
among the general population. Because of the higher income level in Punjab, the ability and&#13;
willingness to pay for services is greater than in the other two states. As a result, there exists&#13;
considerable opportunity to increase revenue collection through increased charges and better collection&#13;
methods. In West Bengal. the existing system for exempting the poor is based on an 'Indigent&#13;
Certificate' from the local elected representative, given to families with an income level below Rs.&#13;
1,500 per month. The West Bengal Government proposes to use this criterion rather than the JRY&#13;
criterion because the latter does not apply to large portions of the urban population of West Bengal. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that the&#13;
agreed mechanism for exempting the poor from user fees would remain in place.&#13;
II. Project Investments&#13;
2.19   The project in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would finance the activities noted below:&#13;
(1) Management Development and Institutional Strengthening by: (a) improving the institutional&#13;
framework for policy development; (b) strengthening the management and implementation capacity of&#13;
institutions; and (c) developing a surveillance capacity for major communicable diseases and response&#13;
capabilities;&#13;
(2) improving Service Quality. Access and Effectiveness at the First Referral Level, through:&#13;
(a) upgrading community, subdivisional and district hospitals; (b) upgrading effectiveness of clinical&#13;
and support services; and (c) improving the referral mechanism and strengthening linkages with the&#13;
primary and tertiary health care levels; and&#13;
(3) Improving access to Primary Health Care in Remote and Underdeveloped areas by:&#13;
(a) upgrading primary health centers and improving access to primary health care services in the&#13;
Sunderban area of southern West Bengal; and (b) increasing access to primary health care services&#13;
among the SC/ST population in Karnataka.&#13;
Component 1. Management Development and Institutional Strengthening (US$26.6 million. 7% of&#13;
base costs)&#13;
2.20   Improving the Institutional Framework for Policy Development. Sectoral capacity for&#13;
development of policy would be strengthened in each state through the creation of a strategic planning&#13;
cell headed by a person of the rank of a Joint Secretary who would report directly to the Secretary,&#13;
DOHFW in each state. The planning cell would monitor the critical issues in the health sector in the&#13;
state by commissioning studies, workshops and seminars and by directly hiring consultants to facilitate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
these activities. As noted earlier, some of the issues would include monitoring the development of the&#13;
private health sector including private and social insurance, reviewing the suitability of present&#13;
regulations relating to the quality of private care provision, evaluating the burden of disease and cost-&#13;
effectiveness of public health interventions and reviewing medical manpower. In addition, the strategic&#13;
planning cell in each state would review implementation of cost recovery mechanisms and sectoral&#13;
resource allocation patterns. Under this sub-component the project would finance furniture, vehicles,&#13;
equipment including computers, local training, studies, fellowships, workshops, consultants,&#13;
operational expenses and salaries of incremental staff on a decreasing basis.&#13;
2.21   Strengthening  Management and  Implementation  Capacity.   Project management&#13;
arrangements in the three states have several common elements and some differences. Project&#13;
management arrangements have taken into account the existing organizational set-up and&#13;
implementation capacity of DOHFW, the health programs currently being implemented by the&#13;
Department and the overall set-up of public administration in the state, especially with regard to the&#13;
nature of decentralized administration in each state. In Karnataka and West Bengal, the project will be&#13;
managed and irnplemented by DOHFW, which will be strengthened under the project to address&#13;
increased investment at the primary and secondary levels of health care under the project. In Punjab,&#13;
the project will be managed and implemented by the PHSC, which was passed as an Ordinance on&#13;
October 20, 1995. The PHSC is an autonomous agency under the aegis of DOHFW. The aim of the&#13;
PHSC is to establish, expand, improve and administer medical care at the secondary or first referral&#13;
level in Punjab (see Annex 6 on Project Management). The project would also provide support to the&#13;
PHSC for the promotion of health care activities in Punjab, through private and voluntary&#13;
organizations, the details of which would be worked out during implementation. In addition, the&#13;
project would provide physical facilities in Karnataka and West Bengal to consolidate, in one location,&#13;
project related activities that are currently dispersed across Bangalore and Calcutta; and upgrade the&#13;
office facilities of the PHSC and DOHFW in Punjab. At Negotiations, the Government of Punjab and&#13;
the PHSC provided assurances that they would take all measures necessary to: (i) enable PHSC to&#13;
carry out its part of the project; and (ii) the PHSC would undertake health care activities under the&#13;
project at the secondary level in accordance with service delivery norms acceptable to the Association,&#13;
and in carrying out other health care activities would ensure that the ability of PHSC to perform its&#13;
obligations under the Agreement would not be materially and adversely affected.&#13;
2.22   Management arrangements in each state would be evaluated from time to time to see whether&#13;
the management system is producing the best results. In addition, a review of overall state finances as&#13;
well as the financial situation of the health sector would be undertaken, and, if necessary, would form&#13;
the basis of additional measures to achieve financial sustainability of the project. At Negotiations, the&#13;
Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that not later than June 30,&#13;
1999, they would carry out, jointly with GOI and IDA, a detailed mid-term review of project progress&#13;
including management and financial reviews, in accordance with terms of reference agreed with IDA,&#13;
and thereafter implement their recommendations.&#13;
2.23   Staff strength at the Head Office to undertake increased responsibilities and perform some new&#13;
functions would be enhanced. Headquarters staff would be increased to meet the increased workload&#13;
and reorient the structure of DOHFW in Karnataka and West Bengal and the PHSC in Punjab to meet&#13;
their new challenges. Specific areas targeted for strengthening include the training and referral unit, the&#13;
finance and audit unit, the Office of the Director (General) and the Office of the Director, (Service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Delivery). Parallel improvements and strengthening of the management and implementation capacity at&#13;
the hospital level would be undertaken. These actions would facilitate systems improvement, wider&#13;
access and improved data collection and utilization for planning and policy making, problem solving&#13;
and monitoring at all levels of management, including the facility level. In all the states, at the hospital&#13;
level, both information collection and management are fairly rudimentary. The project would:&#13;
(i) enhance and extend the computerized system through the provision of hardware and software, and&#13;
consultancy support; (ii) establish trained and equipped information cells at HQ and district levels;&#13;
(iii) train all management staff in appropriate record keeping; and (iv) introduce a completely revised&#13;
medical record system for in-patients and diagnostic services. Under this sub-component the project&#13;
would finance minor civil works, professional services, furniture, other equipment including computers,&#13;
vehicles, other supplies, MIS/IEC materials, studies, workshops, local training, fellowships and&#13;
operational expenses and salaries of incremental staff on a decreasing basis. At Negotiations, the&#13;
Governments of Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that DOHFW in Karnataka&#13;
and West Bengal and PHSC in Punjab would appoint or engage additional headquarters personnel and&#13;
all other personnel to be hired under the project in accordance with a schedule agreed with IDA.&#13;
2.24   Developing Surveillance Capacity for Major Communicable Diseases. The surveillance&#13;
system for major communicable diseases proposed under the project would cover the identification of&#13;
cases through education of health workers and community involvement; indexing of cases or isolation&#13;
of cases and treatmnent; and tracing of contacts for monitoring and evaluation. In the long-term,&#13;
however, the surveillance system would need to be expanded to include preventive examination among&#13;
those most likely to be infected and carrying out immunization; and an enhanced response capability in&#13;
case of outbreak or epidemric. This project would fill some of the gaps in the national disease programs&#13;
by linking the three elements noted above and providing treatment at the primary and secondary levels.&#13;
2.25   Each state has identified a list of communicable diseases for routine surveillance. Explicit&#13;
criteria for monitoring these communicable diseases would be set to avoid any ambiguity in reporting&#13;
by different agencies. Emphasis has been put on a community-based system for early detection and&#13;
reporting and the full participation of local level institutions working at the village or community will&#13;
be necessary to make the system more effective. For example in West Bengal, stamp printed red cards&#13;
would be introduced for quick transmission of information on communicable diseases, and would&#13;
contain information such as name, age, sex, address, date of onset, immunization status, date of death&#13;
(if any) of every patient with or died from a specific communicable disease. The red card would be&#13;
used in out-patient departments and entry points of in-patient cases in all health and medical units of&#13;
the state. As soon as a case is detected the card will be filled out and posted to the district&#13;
epidemiological cell which would be provided with the facility under the project to sort, analyze and&#13;
report such incidences to the appropriate authority for quick follow up action. It will also be important&#13;
to include the support of private medical practitioners and private institutions through workshops as&#13;
well as training programs. The implementation of the health management information system (HMIS)&#13;
will improve tracing of contacts as well as provide information on other diseases that are slated to be&#13;
included under HMIS activities. To improve the system, quick containment measures have been&#13;
developed even in the case of a single incidence to prevent possible outbreak of a specific disease&#13;
identified in the priority list. In the case of outbreak/epidemic daily monitoring would be required.&#13;
Under this subcomponent, the project would finance minor civil works, professional services, furniture,&#13;
other equipment and supplies, MIS/IEC materials, local training, operational expenses and salaries of&#13;
incremental staff on a declining basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Component 2. Improving Service Quality and Effectiveness at District. Subdivisional and&#13;
Community/Rural Hospitals (US$308.2 million. 86% of Base Costs)&#13;
2.26   Renovating/Extending  District, Subdivisional and  Community/Rural Hospitals. In&#13;
Karnataka, 21 district, 107 subdivisional and 74 community hospitals would be renovated/extended; in&#13;
Punjab, 13 district, 46 subdivisional, 91 community, one children's and one maternity hospitals would&#13;
be renovated/extended; in West Bengal, 15 district, 60 subdivisional and 95 rural hospitals would be&#13;
renovated/extended. There would not be any new hospitals built under the project. The state&#13;
Govemrnments have confirmed that no new sites will be acquired for upgrading facilities and that all&#13;
premises slated for renovation/extension have existing land. In Kamataka, 3,832 new beds will be&#13;
added to the existing bed strength of 14,858 at first referral facilities; in Punjab, about 2,140 new beds&#13;
will be added to the existing bed strength of 5,822 at first referral facilities; and in West Bengal, no&#13;
additional beds are proposed to the existing 21,723 operational beds in these facilities which a current&#13;
capacity for only 19,964 beds. In West Bengal, the project would create supporting infrastructure for&#13;
the overcrowded facilities to adequately accommodate the 21,723 beds that are already operating but at&#13;
a low level. The proposed increase in bed strength at the secondary level in Kamataka and Punjab are&#13;
justified on the basis of: (i) Indian Planning Commission norms of I bed per 1,000 population overall,&#13;
of which 70% are recommended at the secondary level; and (ii) the epidemiological approach, which is&#13;
based on the total number of beds required to address the burden of disease at the state level. Both&#13;
approaches suggest a greater increase in bed strength in each state than is proposed under the project.&#13;
Staff quarters would also be built in all three states in areas where housing is a problem for staff.&#13;
Under this sub-component, the project would finance civil works, professional services, equipment,&#13;
building maintenance and operational expenses.&#13;
2.27   Upgrading the Effectiveness of Clinical and Support Services and Quality of Services at&#13;
District, Subdivisional and Community/Rural Hospitals. Streamlined norms and standards for&#13;
clinical and support services would be applied at the first referral hospitals. Staffing norms conforming&#13;
to services provided at each type of facility would be adopted, a system for monitoring improvements&#13;
in the quality of clinical care would be established through the adoption of a quality assurance program&#13;
and the capacity of support services would be expanded. Staff skills in clinical and technical areas&#13;
would be enhanced through the provision of training to improve the quality and range of services.&#13;
Management training for professional cadres and on-going in-service training for clinical and technical&#13;
cadres would also be strengthened. This would facilitate the implementation of the quality improvement&#13;
strategy of the project, through which new responsibilities would be provided. It is expected that&#13;
decision-making would be decentralized down to the appropriate management level. Under this sub-&#13;
component the project would finance minor civil works, professional services, furniture, medical and&#13;
other equipment, medical laboratory and other supplies, medicines, vehicles, MIS/IEC materials, local&#13;
training, studies, workshops, fellowships, consultants, equipment and building maintenance,&#13;
operational expenses and salaries of additional staff on a decreasing basis. At Negotiations, the&#13;
Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that they would adopt,&#13;
within six months of upgrading each facility, staffing and technical norms at district, subdivisional and&#13;
community/rural hospitals, as agreed with IDA, to ensure the quality of services.&#13;
2.28   At the first referral level, the focus of improving management effectiveness would be on&#13;
strengthening service delivery. The first referral level would be able to better manage its resources,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
deliver clinical services effectively, and hospitals will be able to play a more important role within the&#13;
district health systems. DOHFW in West Bengal and Karnataka and the PHSC in Punjab would have&#13;
greater freedom of action with regard to recruitment of staff and revenue raising; establish clarity of&#13;
goals, objectives and procedures; create opportunities for contracting out services, especially support&#13;
services; improve medical record-keeping, health management information systems (HMIS) and related&#13;
evaluation and monitoring capacities; provide management training; improve capacity for equipment&#13;
management, especially state-wide maintenance services by enhancing the capacity for equipment&#13;
maintenance and training. To facilitate an early start to this process, the states have taken the&#13;
following action: in Karnataka, the Project Governing Board, Steering Committee and Engineering&#13;
Wing have been established, and key staff have been approved or hired; in Punjab, key staff, including&#13;
the Managing Director of the PHSC, have been appointed; and in West Bengal, key staff, including&#13;
Project Director, have been hired. They have also provided a schedule for the hiring of key staff&#13;
(Annex 6).&#13;
2.29   There is currently no acute shortage of professional staff overall, but there is a shortage of&#13;
some medical specialties and nurses. The first step would be to improve recruitment and prompt filling&#13;
of job vacancies by improving recruitment procedures. An understanding was reached with the states&#13;
that the implementing agencies would have the authority to: (i) advertise, appoint, promote and transfer&#13;
staff internally; (ii) post staff as needed, especially in tribal areas; (iii) introduce appropriate incentives&#13;
to retain staff in remote areas including: provision of staff quarters, bonus at the end of a specified&#13;
period of posting, educational allowance for children of staff posted in remote and tribal areas,&#13;
additional leave eligibility and extra credit for doctors and other staff for post-graduate qualification&#13;
admission and for fellowships; and (iv) relax service rules as necessary to maintain service when&#13;
appropriately qualified staff are unavailable.&#13;
2.30   Due to the scope of the civil works component and the need to ensure adequate maintenance of&#13;
assets as a result, DOHFW  in Karnataka and West Bengal and the PHSC in Punjab would be&#13;
strengthened by providing them with enhanced management and supervision responsibilities of essential&#13;
operational activities, including construction and maintenance activities, in collaboration with local&#13;
Government. An Engineering Wing in the implementing agency in each state would be set up at the&#13;
state and district levels, adequate funds would be provided and the flow of these funds would be&#13;
channeled through the implementing agency. In addition, a Maintenance Cell will be established in&#13;
each large hospital, to manage day-to-day emergent maintenance works.  At Negotiations, the&#13;
Governments of Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that they would provide&#13;
funds, satisfactory to the Association, annually for the maintenance of previously existing equipment in&#13;
health facilities supported under the project.&#13;
2.31   Improving Referral System. The referral system in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal, as&#13;
in the rest of India, does not function well (see Annex 8). Patients perceive the lower level facilities as&#13;
providing lower quality of services. As a result, the lower tiers are underutilized since patients directly&#13;
proceed to higher level hospitals for minor illnesses, thereby overloading the higher level institutions.&#13;
The beneficiary assessment study in West Bengal found that about 2% of the patients at first referral&#13;
facilities were referred from PHCs. It is estimated that a third of all cases which are currently treated&#13;
at tertiary facilities could be treated, and at lower costs, at first referral facilities if those facilities&#13;
received adequate inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
2.32   The project would seek to ensure that a much higher proportion of patients coming to first&#13;
referral hospitals had been seen at PHCs and referred upwards. Likewise, for those patients going to&#13;
tertiary hospitals, the project would implement several measures to strengthen the referral system and&#13;
improve the quality of care at the first referral level. Special attention would also be given to&#13;
establishing mechanisms to improve access for remote and disadvantaged groups and tribal&#13;
communities. The referral system would also be strengthened by establishing an incentive system with&#13;
differentiated user fees for users and non-users and allowing patients to by-pass waiting lines when&#13;
they carry a referral slip. Under this sub-component the project would finance vehicles (purchase, hire&#13;
and maintenance), other supplies, MIS and IEC materials, local training, consultants, fellowships,&#13;
workshops and operational expenses. At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and&#13;
West Bengal provided assurances that they would strengthen the referral system between the primary,&#13;
secondary and tertiary levels by December 31, 1996, by: (i) issuing appropriate directives to hospitals&#13;
to strengthen the management of the referral system; (ii) establish and thereafter maintain and&#13;
implement appropriate referral protocols and clinical management protocols; and (iii) establish and&#13;
thereafter maintain and implement an appropriate incentive system for patients who use the system.&#13;
Component 3. Improving Access to Primary Health Care in Remote and Underdeveloped Areas&#13;
(US$ 24.3 million. 7% of base costs)&#13;
2.33   Upgrading of Primary Health Centers in the Sunderban Area of West Bengal. The&#13;
Sundarban area in southem West Bengal, with a population of about 3.1 million people is among the&#13;
poorest regions in the state with a predominance of small and marginal farmers -- 40% of the&#13;
population belong to SC/STs. The 54 islands, interspersed with bodies of water, are covered with&#13;
forests and swamps. They are intersected from north to south by wide tidal rivers and estuaries and&#13;
from east to west by narrow tidal creeks. Transport and communication networks are inadequate in&#13;
this hostile geographical and topographical location. Metalled roads comprise about 10% of the total&#13;
road surface area. Where available, transport is painfully slow and people have to travel in an&#13;
assortment of country boats, cycle-rickshaws and buses to reach their destinations. There are no major&#13;
hospitals in the region and travel time is at least eight hours from the closest point by public transport&#13;
to Calcutta and its overcrowded health facilities. The remoteness of the region, the lack of transport,&#13;
the poverty of the people and lack of access to health facilities have contributed to the health problems&#13;
of the people in the Sundarban Areas. It is, therefore, proposed that the project would upgrade all the&#13;
28 PHCs and 8 block PHCs in the Sunderban area. In addition, three floating medical units will be set&#13;
up to deliver effective health care in the riverine areas and would be supported by wireless connection.&#13;
A wireless commnunication system will also link up the 36 PHCs and block PHCs with the gram&#13;
panchayat office. Under this subcomponent, the project will finance civil works, professional services,&#13;
furniture, riverine vehicles, medical and other equipment, medical and laboratory supplies, medicines,&#13;
other supplies, MIS/IEC materials, local training, studies, workshops and operational expenses.&#13;
2.34   Increasing Access to Primary Care Services Among SC/ST Population in Karnataka. A&#13;
system of annual health check-ups is proposed under the project for the SC/ST population of&#13;
Karnataka, which account for nearly 20% of the population. The medical check-ups will be made&#13;
available in health check-up camps to be organized at the headquarters of every auxiliary nurse&#13;
midwife (ANM). At the beginning of each year, the district health and family welfare worker would&#13;
draw up a calendar for every PHC indicating the date, time and place at which health check-up teams&#13;
would visit the subcenter. Prior to the date for which health check-up is fixed in a particular village, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
ANM and the male health worker would make house-to-house contact with each SC/ST household to&#13;
ensure maximum attendance. This would also be a good venue for IEC activities relating to the&#13;
dissemination of general public health related issues. The health-check up team would consist of a&#13;
medical officer of the PHC, lady medical officer drafted for the purpose from a government hospitaL&#13;
laboratory technician, lady health visitor, ANM and a paramedical staff. Much of the work will be&#13;
done at the level of the ANM, who will do the early screening. The PHC medical officer will review a&#13;
smaller number of more complex cases. Referral to first referral hospitals will follow the system set up&#13;
under the referral system for the general population. A record of health check-ups will be maintained in&#13;
a master register and each individual would be issued a health check-up card free of cost. These camps&#13;
will also provide family planning services. The novelty of this program is that it will mobilize the PHC&#13;
staff in a manner consistent with the delivery of primary care services originally envisaged under the&#13;
NHP. The subcomponent will finance furniture medical and laboratory supplies, medicines, other&#13;
supplies, MIS/IEC materials, local training operational expenses and salaries of additional staff on a&#13;
decreasing basis.&#13;

III. PROJECT COST, FINANCING, IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
3.1     The total cost of the project is estimated at about Rs. 16,691.4 million or US$416.7 million&#13;
equivalent, including taxes and duties estimated at US$22.2 million equivalent. The project costs in&#13;
Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would be US$136.4 million, US$106.1 million and US$174.2&#13;
million respectively.   IDA  would finance about US$350.0 million or about 88.7 percent of total&#13;
project costs net of taxes; the balance of US$66.7 million would be financed by the Governments of the&#13;
three project states, Karnataka (US$25.0 million), Punjab (US$16.4 million) and West Bengal&#13;
(US$25.3 million). The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$94.6 million. The&#13;
project would finance civil works, equipment and furniture, vehicles, medical and laboratory supplies,&#13;
medicines, other supplies, MIS/IEC supplies, professional services, training, studies and evaluations,&#13;
workshops, and operational expenses and salaries of incremental staff on a declining basis. Details of&#13;
cost estimates, financing plan, procurement arrangements and disbursements plans are shown in the&#13;
various annexes of the SAR.&#13;

3.3    Basis of Cost Estimates. Estimated costs for civil works are based on current unit costs for&#13;
construction which vary from US$135 per square meter in Karnataka and Punjab to US$165 per&#13;
square meter in West Bengal of gross floor area of construction. The higher unit costs in West Bengal&#13;
are due to the relative scarcity of building material in the state. These costs are comparable to IDA-&#13;
assisted construction in India. Costs of professional services for design reflect the scale of fees&#13;
established for similar services provided by local architectural consulting firms. Costs for supervision&#13;
of construction reflect the standard ongoing charges in the private sector. Cost estimates for furniture,&#13;
medical equipment, vehicles and medical supplies are product of lists developed by DOHFW, and&#13;
include import duties and taxes. Costs of other supplies are based on the state estimates and reflect&#13;
current prices. Estimated costs for the salaries of additional staff are based on basic pay scales&#13;
including standard allowances for social and other benefits applicable in each project State.&#13;
3.4    Customs Duties and Taxes. All imported goods are subject to customs duties and taxes. The&#13;
estimated cost of the project includes import duties and taxes estimated at about US$22.2 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
3.5    Contingency Allowances. Estimated project costs include physical contingencies (US$33.6&#13;
million) estimated at 10% of all physical components and at 5% for technical assistance, training and&#13;
salaries. The estimated costs of the project also include price contingencies (US$24.0 million) to cover&#13;
expected price escalation at the following rates. For civil works, goods, salaries, technical assistance&#13;
and operation and maintenance - foreign costs: 4.4% in FY96, 1.8% in FY97 and FY98, 2.2% in&#13;
FY99, 2.3% in FY00 and FY01, and 2.4% in FY02; local costs: 8.7% in FY96, 8.2% in FY97, and&#13;
7.5% in FY98, 6.5% in FY99, 6.0% in FY00 through FY02.&#13;
3.6    Foreign Exchange Component. The estimated foreign exchange component of US$94.6&#13;
million is calculated on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as follows: (a) civil works&#13;
15%; (b) professional services 20%; (c) furniture 10%; (d) equipment 60%; (e) locally manufactured&#13;
vehicles 12%; (f) imported vehicles 90%; (g) medical laboratory supplies 20%; (h) medicine 50%; (i)&#13;
MIS and IEC materials 25%; (j) foreign fellowships 90%; (k) operation and maintenance, and&#13;
maintenance for buildings and equipment 10%.&#13;
B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.7    The estimated total project cost of US$416.7 million equivalent would be financed by an IDA&#13;
Credit of US$350.0 million equivalent, which would cover about 88.7 percent of the project costs net&#13;
of taxes. The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would finance the remaining costs&#13;
of US$44.5 million plus all taxes (US$22.2 million).&#13;
3.8    The credit would be made available to GOI on standard terms and conditions and on-lent to the&#13;
Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal under standard arrangements for development&#13;
assistance to the states; and Punjab would further transfer the funds to PHSC as a grant. Under current&#13;
GOI policies and regulations, on-lending to Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal takes the form of 30%&#13;
grant/70% loan at 12% interest per annum over 20 years. GOI would assume foreign exchange risk.&#13;
At Negotiations, an understanding was reached with GOI that it would release about three month's&#13;
anticipated project expenditures in advance to the project states (in accordance with the amounts&#13;
established in the Annual Plans), and that upon receipt of funds from GOI, the Governments of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would transfer all such funds, together with its quarterly&#13;
counterpart contributions, immediately to the project accounts of DOHFW in Karnataka and West&#13;
Bengal and the DOHFW/PHSC in Punjab.&#13;
C. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.9    Table 3.3 summarizes the project items, their related cost estimates and proposed methods of&#13;
procurement. Project-related procurement for goods, works and services would follow procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA using ICB and NCB documents acceptable to the Association. Project-financed&#13;
consultants would be recruited according to Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, and medical laboratory supplies would be bulked to&#13;
the extent possible and any individual contract exceeding US$200,000 equivalent would be procured&#13;
under ICB procedures. This is also true for vehicles including riverine vehicles, except for those&#13;
needed for immediate use costing up to an aggregate of US$300,000 only, which may be procured&#13;
through national shopping or Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&amp;D), New Delhi&#13;
rate contract. Shopping under the project would include international shopping procedures, based on&#13;
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries, or&#13;
national shopping procedures with solicitation of price quotations from at least three suppliers, all in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.10    Civil Works (US$152.2 million). The civil works component entails no new hospital&#13;
construction but does involve large and small scale renovations and extensions to 557 hospitals over&#13;
the five year life of the project. An estimated 475 contracts (costing US$134.2 million) will be carried&#13;
out through national competitive bidding. These works average between US$300,000 and US$500,000&#13;
and would not be of any interest to foreign bidders and would be procured under NCB procedures.&#13;
Contracts for the remaining works estimated to cost about US$ 45,000 equivalent or less per contract&#13;
at about 400 sites up to an aggregate not exceeding US$18.0 million scattered and in remote areas&#13;
shall be procured, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association: (i) through Force&#13;
Account limited to US$10,000,000; (ii) by direct contracting; or (iii) under quotations solicited from at&#13;
least three qualified contractors.&#13;
3.11   Equipment (US$84.5 million). Procurement of most of the equipment would be phased on an&#13;
annual basis in accordance with the requirements of the project activities. Contracts valued at over&#13;
US$200,000 would be procured through ICB for an amount equal to US$54.9 million. Contracts&#13;
valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an&#13;
amount not exceeding US$12.7 million. Purchases totaling US$50,000 or less, and not exceeding in&#13;
aggregate US$12.7 million and US$4.2 million equivalent, may respectively be awarded on the basis of&#13;
national and international shopping based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
(a) three suppliers from two eligible countries for international shopping and (b) three national&#13;
suppliers for national shopping. An estimated 200 contracts will be carried out through ICB and NCB,&#13;
ranging from over US$200,000 to US$750,000 per contract. Phasing of the procurement of equipment&#13;
will be closely sequenced with the civil works program. Details on the type of equipment and&#13;
packaging are available as working papers.&#13;
3.12   Vehicles (US$14.6 Million) would be procured during the first two years of the project&#13;
through ICB for an amount not exceeding US$14.3 million. To facilitate project start-up activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
procurement of vehicles up to an aggregate of US$300,000 will be undertaken by the three states under&#13;
national shopping procedures or DGS&amp;D rate contracts. An estimated 24 contracts would be carried&#13;
out through ICB, ranging from US$200,000 to US$800,000 per contract.&#13;

3.13   Furniture (US$11.4 million), Laboratory Supplies (US$5.4 million) MIS/IEC Materials&#13;
(US$6.9 million) and Other Supplies (US$18.5 million) would be purchased as follows. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$17.6 million (furniture -&#13;
US$2.8 million, medical laboratory supplies - US$2.3 million, MIS/IEC materials US$1.7 million and&#13;
other supplies US$1 1.1 million) may be awarded on the basis of national shopping with solicitation of&#13;
price quotations from at least three suppliers. This is again based on the fact that this amount covers&#13;
purchases by 557 hospitals over a period of five years. Contracts valued at US$50,000 equivalent or&#13;
more would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an amount not&#13;
exceeding US$23.8 million (furniture - US$8.5 million, medical laboratory supplies - US$2.7 million,&#13;
MIS/IEC materials - US$5.2 million and other supplies - US$7.4 million). Contract for medical&#13;
laboratory supply estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract, not to exceed an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$0.4 million equivalent will be awarded under international shopping procedures, based&#13;
on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from two different eligible&#13;
countries in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.14   Medicines (US$27.2 million) would be purchased by each of the 557 hospitals as well as by&#13;
DOHFW in Karnataka and West Bengal and the Health Systems Corporation in Punjab several times&#13;
per year over the five year life of the project. Bulking requirements would not always be feasible due&#13;
to shelf life of the medicines. As a result, the individual purchases would be small and not likely to&#13;
attract foreign bidders. Accordingly, contracts valued at US$50,000 equivalent or more would be&#13;
awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an amount not exceeding US$22.0&#13;
million. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$5.2&#13;
million may be awarded on the basis of National and International Shopping procedures based on&#13;
comparing price quotations obtained from at least: (a) three suppliers for national shopping; (b) three&#13;
suppliers from two different eligible countries, in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.15   Studies and Consultancy Contracts (US$2.9 million) and Professional Services (US$15.2&#13;
million). Professional services will be used mainly for architectural and engineering services which will&#13;
be provided from within the country. Consultants required under the project will be hired following&#13;
procedures prescribed in "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by Worla Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency"; August, 1981. Documents used for inviting proposals, terms of reference&#13;
for all consultancies and single-source contracts will be subject to prior review for all contracts valued&#13;
at US$100,000 or more awarded to firms and US$50,000 or more to be awarded to individuals. The&#13;
professional services entail approximately 500 contracts valued from about US$15,000 to US$60,000;&#13;
this many contracts would not be suitable for international consulting firms. These contracts will&#13;
include topographical surveys, soil tests, architectural and engineering fees, and supervision of&#13;
construction.&#13;
3.16   Fellowship, Training, and Workshops (US$10.7 million). This category includes expenses&#13;
related to training of about 22,663 medical professionals over the life of the project in respect of&#13;
seminars, workshops, travel and subsistence allowances.&#13;
3.17   Equipment Maintenance (US$7.0 million) and Building Maintenance (US$3.1 million).&#13;
Maintenance costs for vehicles, medical and other equipment items estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$5,000 per contract up to an aggregate of US$7.0 million would be procured from local commercial&#13;
suppliers of such services: (i) through direct contracting; or (ii) under quotations solicited from at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
three suppliers in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. Maintenance of buildings and&#13;
building equipment (funded by the project), estimated to cost US$5,000 equivalent or less per contract&#13;
upto an aggregate of US$3.1 million, shall be carried out by other procedures where such arrangements&#13;
already exist or by obtaining three quotations from local contractors in accordance with procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.18  IDA Review. Prior to the issuance of any invitations to bid for contracts, the proposed&#13;
procurement plan for the project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval, in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines. Procurement of all&#13;
goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with such procurement plan as shall have been&#13;
approved by the Bank, and with the provisions of said paragraph 1. All procurement under contracts&#13;
costing US$300,000 equivalent or more for civil works and US$200,000 equivalent or more for goods&#13;
would be subject to prior review; the rest would be subject to post review. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to random post review in the field by visiting missions. Other contracts for civil works and&#13;
goods would be subject to IDA review after contract award. Contracts for the hiring of consulting firm&#13;
costing US$100,000 equivalent or more and contracts for hiring individual consultant costing&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent or more, would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA. Approximately&#13;
60% of the value of the IDA Credit would require prior review.&#13;
D. Disbursement Profile&#13;
3.19   The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed over five and a half years. This is shorter by 18&#13;
months than the standard profile for PHR projects in India. The project is expected to be completed on&#13;
September 30, 2001 and the credit closed on March 31, 2002. Table 3.4 below shows forecasts of&#13;
expenditures and disbursements.&#13;

3.20   Disbursement Percentages and Required Documentation.  The IDA Credit would be&#13;
disbursed against 85% of expenditures on civil works: 100% on professional services, consultants and&#13;
fellowships; 100 percent of CIF and ex-factory costs or 80% of other local expenditure on furniture,&#13;
equipment, vehicles, medicines and materials, MIS and EEC materials; and 65% of salaries of&#13;
incremental staff and other recurrent costs on a declining basis during the project period starting with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
90% until December 31, 1998, 75% until December 31, 2000 .:rd 40% thereafter. Disbursements for&#13;
civil works over US$300,000 equivalent per contract, goods over US$200,000 equivalent per contract,&#13;
consulting firm contracts over US$100,000 and individual consultants over US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
would be fully documented and all other expenditures would be disbursed on the basis of statement of&#13;
expenditures. Each state Government would maintain complete records of funds disbursed, including&#13;
certificates of completion signed by the District Executive Engineer, the Managing Director of Punjab&#13;
Health Systems Corporation and the Project Coordinators in Karnataka and West Bengal.&#13;
3.21   Special Account and Central Government Advance to the State. In order to accelerate&#13;
disbursements in respect of IDA's share of expenditures prefinanced by GOI and the state&#13;
Governments, and to allow for direct payment of other eligible local and foreign expenditures, a Special&#13;
Account would be maintained in the Reserve Bank of India in the amount of US$17.0 million&#13;
equivalent to cover four months of estimated disbursements through the Special Account.&#13;
3.22   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing for project preparation in the amount of US$10&#13;
million, about 2.8 percent of the proposed credit, is provided to cover eligible expenditures incurred in&#13;
implementing appraised project activities after May 1, 1995. Retroactive financing in support of&#13;
project preparation would support initial staff appointments, technical survey of the existing hospitals&#13;
under the project including topographical site surveys and soil tests, preparation of preliminary designs,&#13;
and initial construction activities. Procurement arrangements were reviewed and found appropriate.&#13;
E. Project Implementation&#13;
3.23  In Karnataka and West Bengal, the project will be managed and implemented by DOHFW. In&#13;
Punjab, the project will be managed and implemented by the Punjab Health Systems Corporation&#13;
(PHSC). Lists of staff or Committee Members, organograms for each state, and the functional levels of&#13;
project management in each state are shown in Annex 6.&#13;
3.24  In all three states, a Project Governing Board (PGB)/ Board of Directors (BOD) will be at the&#13;
top of the project management structure. It will include high level representation from all relevant&#13;
parts of the state Government that are associated with the project. The PBG/BOD will be fully&#13;
empowered to make major policy decisions and develop the broad policy outline for the project;&#13;
approve the annual budget; authorize major project revisions as necessary; ratify decisions made by the&#13;
Steering Committee (in Karnataka); formulate rules and regulations; and undertake an annual review of&#13;
project implementation and monitor overall project progress. The PGB/BOD in each state would have&#13;
the responsibility for supervising the activities of project management. A provision has been met under&#13;
the project for the use of consultancy/professional services under technical assistance to support this&#13;
function, especially with regard to the new approach to the management of civil works. The PGB in&#13;
Karnataka and West Bengal would meet twice a year, while the BOD in Punjab would meet more&#13;
often. The Strategic Planning Cell would report to the PGB/BOD.&#13;
3.25  In Karnataka, but not in West Bengal or Punjab, there would be a Steering Committee under&#13;
the PGB. The Steering Committee would delegate adequate powers to the PGB to carry out its&#13;
functions as the nodal body for project implementation. The Secretary, DOHFW, would be the&#13;
Chairman of the Steering Committee and the Project Coordinator. The Steering Committee will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
supervise and monitor project implementation, undertake planning activities and facilitate project&#13;
management activities.&#13;
3.26   Reporting to the PGB/BOD directly, in Punjab and West Bengal, and through the Steering&#13;
Conmmittee in Karnataka, would be the Project Management Cell (PMC). The PMC would be headed&#13;
by an Additional Secretary as the Project Administrator in Karnataka, a Special Secretary as the&#13;
Managing Director of the PHSC in Punjab, and a Special Secretary as the Project Director in West&#13;
Bengal. This official would be assisted by medical, technical, engineering services, financial&#13;
management and administration and personnel divisions. The functions of the PMC would include all&#13;
aspects of routine project management, monitoring progress, maintaining flow-of-funds and project&#13;
account, providing technical guidance and general administration, and preparing progress reports.&#13;
3.27   At the district level, a District Health Committee/Project Implementation Cell would facilitate&#13;
functioning of the various activities to be carried out under the project. In Karnataka and West Bengal,&#13;
District Health Committees have been approved/established in all districts. At Negotiations, the&#13;
Governments of Karnataka and West Bengal provided assurances that they would maintain District&#13;
Health Commitees in all districts of the states to facilitate the collection and distribution of user&#13;
charges, maintenance of equipment, waste management, training of technical staff, quality assurance&#13;
surveillance of major communicable diseases and monitoring and supervision of project related&#13;
activities.&#13;
3.28   The initial phase of project implementation will focus on developmental activities including&#13;
project launch; monitoring mechanisms and performance indicators; strengthening health MIS system&#13;
and surveillance network for major communicable disease; initiating in-service training of staff in&#13;
clinical, management and equipment matter; strengthening the functions and appointing key staff and&#13;
supplying equipment to existing hospitals to improve the quality of service program. The disbursement&#13;
profile relating to the balance of hardware and software aspects of the project would be monitored&#13;
during supervision to ensure that an optimal balance between the two is maintained. The first phase of&#13;
the hospital upgradation program would consist of 42 hospitals in West Bengal, 45 hospitals in&#13;
Karnataka and 40 hospitals in Punjab. During the initial phase, the implementation plan would be to:&#13;
complete topographical site surveys and soil tests; finalize and complete all drawings including site&#13;
development plans, invite bids and commence construction for all hospitals under the four planned&#13;
phases (see Annex 18); and complete over 50 percent of phase I and phase II and about 25% of phase&#13;
III and phase IV; and prepare and complete all drawings including site development plans, launch bids&#13;
and sign contracts of all 557 hospitals, 28 PHCs and 8 Block PHCs requiring upgradation. About 35&#13;
percent of total construction is expected to be completed by the end of the second year. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that they&#13;
would review with IDA annually by April 30 of each year the progress of project implementation over&#13;
the preceding twelve months and prepare an annual work plan for the following twelve months&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
F. Status of Project Development&#13;
3.29   The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal have finalized their project proposals&#13;
(September, 1995) in consultation with IDA missions and on the basis of workshops on service norms,&#13;
project management and policy issues organized by each state. Based on these norms and taking into&#13;
account cost-effectiveness criteria, the proposals have defined appropriate staffing patterns, physical&#13;
upgradation of facilities, equipment requirements and the need for support services. Letters of Health&#13;
Sector Development Program furnished by each state were finalized during Negotiations (see Annex 2).&#13;
Project management arrangements, additional staffing requirements and functional responsibilities have&#13;
been finalized and found satisfactory by IDA (see Annex 6).&#13;
3.30   Beneficiary assessment and private sector studies have been completed in Karnataka, Punjab&#13;
and West Bengal. The findings and recommendations of these studies have been used to fine-tune&#13;
project design in each state. The tribal and backward areas strategy proposed for the project in&#13;
Karnataka and West Bengal was found satisfactory by the IDA team; Punjab will have no tribal&#13;
strategy since there is no tribal population in the state (see Annex 13).&#13;
3.31   An extensive survey of all health facilities to be included under the project has been completed&#13;
in Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal. Samples of the surveys in all three states have been reviewed&#13;
and found satisfactory. Each state has recruited consultants to ensure timely preparation of designs,&#13;
architectural and engineering drawings, and written bid documents. Preliminary designs of about 35&#13;
hospitals have been initially reviewed. The state Governments have been informed that these should be&#13;
in accordance with World Bank guidelines for the use of consultants to ensure that retroactive&#13;
financing would be applicable. The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal have&#13;
prepared procurement plans and discussed and agreed on the bidding documents for procurement&#13;
activities in the first two years of implementation.&#13;
3.32   All clinical, equipment and staffing norms have been reviewed and agreed with the states. An&#13;
essential drug list has been prepared by each state and found satisfactory by IDA. An inventory of the&#13;
nature and state of the current equipment at each facility that will receive inputs under the proposed&#13;
project, including the primnary care facilities in the Sunderbans area of West Bengal, has been&#13;
completed in Karnataka and West Bengal. Following this exercise, an analysis has been completed of&#13;
the equipment requirements at each facility. Punjab is nearing completion of this exercise.&#13;
3.33   A plan for a surveillance system for major communicable diseases has been discussed with&#13;
each state. Community participation in the surveillance network has been incorporated and links with&#13;
HMIS have been elaborated in the proposals. All three states have developed a comprehensive plan for&#13;
the implementation of medical waste management which includes tertiary hospitals not covered by the&#13;
project (see Annex 11).&#13;
3.34   The overall implementation schedule for the different project components has been carefully&#13;
synchronized. With regard to implementation schedules: civil works program has been prepared in&#13;
each state and procurement packages for civil works have been finalized; lists of the equipment to be&#13;
purchased under the project has also been finalized; training for staff, IEC, HMIS, referral system,&#13;
waste management, surveillance system, and other software aspects of the project have also been&#13;
finalized and found satisfactory by IDA (see Annex 18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
3.35    A list of performance indicators has been discussed and agreed upon (see Annex 19).&#13;
Baseline data on the performance indicators have been mostly put together by the states. The concept&#13;
of medical audit, which will extend the scope of monitoring activities under the project at the hospital&#13;
level, would be finalized at a joint workshop to be held in March, 1996. The workshop will also&#13;
finalize clinical training modules and the scope of the quality assurance program at the hospital level.&#13;
3.36   Workshop on traini. m odules for each category of staff was held in Calcutta, and attended&#13;
by Kamataka and Punjab as well. Based on this, each state has developed a list of number staff to be&#13;
trained, and the focus, location and duration of training (see Annex 7). The three states confirmed that&#13;
the management training component would be contracted out to management institutes.&#13;
3.37   Prior to Negotiations, the three state Governments took the following actions: (i) a Letter of&#13;
Health Sector Development Policy was furnished by each state, which was finalized during&#13;
Negotiations; (ii) relevant state Government clearances, as well as cleara,ce from the Planning&#13;
Commission, GOI, were obtained; (iii) Strategic Planning Cells were set up within the DOHFW in&#13;
Karnataka and West Bengal and PHSC in Punjab; (iv) a mechanism for ensuring that existing level of&#13;
user charges are implemented more rigorously was approved, an agreed mechanism for exempting the&#13;
poor from user fees is in place, and District Health Commnittees in Karnataka and West Bengal have&#13;
been approved/established; (v) an Ordinance was passed by the Government of Punjab, establishing the&#13;
PHSC; (vi) regulations relating to Board procedures, personnel policies, audits and accounts, and user&#13;
charges have been issued; (vii) in Karnataka, the Project Governing Board, Steering Committee and&#13;
Engineering Wing were established, and key staff were approved or hired; (viii) in Punjab, key staff;&#13;
including the Managing Director of the PHSC, were appointed; (ix) in West Bengal, key staff,&#13;
including Project Director, were hired; and (x) in Karnataka and West Bengal, Government Orders&#13;
were issued, providing authority to DOHFW to manage essential operational activities including civil&#13;
works construction and maintenance activities.&#13;
G. Social Assessment&#13;
3.38   A Social Assessment (SA) was undertaken for this project and was utilized extensively to fine-&#13;
tune project design (see Annex 14). Some issues addressed by the SA included: the social risks which&#13;
might affect the success of the project, including the institutional and management arrangements and&#13;
capacity building at appropriate levels of administration; the social and cultural factors that affect the&#13;
ability of stakeholders to participate or benefit from the proposed project; and the impact of the project&#13;
on women and vulnerable groups. A multi-pronged strategy was adopted to gather the data required&#13;
for the SA. This included: basic demographic, epidemiological and socio-economic data from&#13;
secondary sources; and primary data on demand and supply factors affecting health care delivery&#13;
generated through participatory observations, interviews, case studies, focus groups, surveys and rapid&#13;
rural appraisal.&#13;
3.39   An important aspect of the SA was the involvement of key stakeholders. Preparation of the&#13;
project devoted special attention to facilitating a sense of ownership and commitment of those involved&#13;
in the process. They included: (i) the Government of India (GOI), the state Governments of Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal, and agencies responsible for project implementation; (ii) the beneficiaries i.e.&#13;
the individuals, groups and communities who would benefit from the proposed intervention;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
(iii) women, scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST); and (iv) others with a vested interest in&#13;
development initiatives, including other donor agencies, NGOs, religious and community organizations,&#13;
local authorities and the private sector. The SA contributed to developing the following key aspects of&#13;
project design:&#13;
*  increased access to improved health services for women, by strengthening the link between&#13;
community hospitals with primary health centers, especially for emergency obstetric care, through&#13;
improvements in the referral mechanism for these services. In addition, the life-cycle approach to&#13;
women's health, including screening for reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases (STDs), IEC, and increasing women's awareness of their options in terms of&#13;
health care, has been incorporated in the service norms.&#13;
*  increased access to improved health services for SC/ST groups, by strengthening the link between&#13;
primary and first referral health system; providing an incentive package to medical staff to accept&#13;
assignments in tribal areas; reducing costs to tribals of utilizing the system; and increasing hospital&#13;
beds in tribal areas to reflect a share of beds which is much more commensurate with their&#13;
proportion in the overall population.&#13;
-  exempting the poor from user charges, by instituting adequate mechanisms in each state. In&#13;
addition, with regard to user charges, appropriate collection and management arrangements would&#13;
be strengthened; and the revenue collected would be reallocated to hospitals within the districts.&#13;
*  enhanced contribution of the private sector in health care delivery, through contracting-out selected&#13;
services as appropriate. In addition, NGO participation in remote and underdeveloped areas would&#13;
be promoted.&#13;
*  increased efficiency and effectiveness of the first referral network, through the development of&#13;
technical norms on the basis of the existing burden of disease in each state.&#13;
*  improved effectiveness of the primary health care system, by developing links with the secondary&#13;
level through the referral mechanism, and by strengthening its management, implementing referral&#13;
and clinical protocols, and establishing an incentive system for utilizing the referral mechanism.&#13;
H. Fiscal Analysis&#13;
3.40   The fiscal analysis undertaken for this project covers a number of issues that assisted in fine-&#13;
tuning project design and policy reform in each state. These include: (i) an analysis of public&#13;
expenditure in the health sector and recurrent cost implications of the project (see Annex 3);&#13;
(ii) sustainability analysis of the project, including impact on health and state finances (see Annex 3);&#13;
and (iii) alternative scenarios estimating the generation of additional resources through user charges&#13;
(see Annex 5).&#13;
3.41   Public Expenditure on Health and Recurrent Cost. An analysis of public expenditure on&#13;
health is presented in paras. 1.17-1.20, and in Annex 3. The burden of recurrent costs of the project in&#13;
relation to overall health expenditures is analyzed, on the basis of the following questions: (i) what will&#13;
be size of the incremental recurrent costs as a percentage of the state's health and FW current budget;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
(ii) what will be the size of the incremental recurrent costs as a percentage of the state's plan and non-&#13;
plan current budget; (iii) what will be the likely share of the first referral level as a percentage of the&#13;
health and FW budget at project completion; and (iv) how much funds can user charges reasonably&#13;
generate at project completion.&#13;
3.42   Incremental annual recurrent costs including contingencies at project completion are expected&#13;
to be about Rs. 360 million in Karnataka, about Rs. 250 million in West Bengal, and about Rs. 150&#13;
million in Punjab. This compares to current allocations for Health and Family Welfare of&#13;
about Rs. 4,872 million in Karnataka, Rs. 5,570 million in West Bengal and Rs 2,202 million in&#13;
Punjab. Assuming continuation of past trends in overall expenditures in the year following the end of&#13;
the project, allocations would amount to Rs. 6,950 million in Kamnataka, Rs. 6,803 million in West&#13;
Bengal and Rs. 2,956 million in Punjab. Incremental recurrent costs of the project would amount to&#13;
5.2%, 3.7% and 5.1% of total revenue expenditures for the Health and Family Welfare Departments in&#13;
Karnataka, West Bengal, and Punjab respectively. The incremental recurrent costs of the project imply&#13;
an increase share for health of total Government expenditures of around 0.3 percentage points in&#13;
Karnataka, 0.3 percentage points in West Bengal and 0.2 percentage points in Punjab.&#13;
3.43   These increments should not be a problem for the state to provide. The state Governments&#13;
would meet the incremental recurrent cost needs by increasing the size of the health budget and by&#13;
reallocating incremental resources from the tertiary to the secondary level of health care. A&#13;
commitrnent to this effect has been provided in the Letter of Health Sector Development Program. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal provided assurances that:&#13;
(i) their respective incremental budgetary allocations under the project for the primary and first referral&#13;
levels for each fiscal year during the implementation of the project would be fully additional to the&#13;
allocations made in FY95; (ii) and budgetary allocations for recurrent expenditures at the first referral&#13;
level would be provided on a timely basis adequate to meet resource requirement under the project's&#13;
annual operating plan for each year.&#13;
3.44   Sustainability. The deterioration in the overall financial position of the states suggests that a&#13;
sustainability analysis beyond the traditional recurrent cost implications of project investment be&#13;
undertaken. As such, a limited analysis of financial sustainability is presented. In Kamataka, the&#13;
revenue account in 1993/94 was in surplus. The gross fiscal deficit is equivalent to 17 percent of&#13;
revenues -- one of the smallest among the major states. Interest payments on debt accounted for 11.6&#13;
percent of total revenue expenditures in 1992/93 rising to 12.7 percent in 1994/95. Public debt was&#13;
equal to 26.3 percent of state domestic product in 1990/91 and to 27.0 percent in 1994/95. The&#13;
indicators of public finances in Karnataka show some slight deterioration over the past few years as a&#13;
result of increased borrowing for capital expenditures but overall demonstrate a picture of reasonable&#13;
strength. The financial implications of the project for the state government include the necessity to&#13;
service the loan, as well as the incremental recurring expenditure. Including contingencies the&#13;
projected loan represents 4.7% of the current outstanding debt of the state government. Given the&#13;
current relatively low share of interest payments in total revenue expenditures (second to lowest among&#13;
the eleven major states) the additional burden arising from this project should be manageable.&#13;
3.45   In Punjab, the deficit on the revenue account was estimated at 13.5% of revenue receipts in&#13;
1994/95 and to 23 and 24% in the two previous years. The gross fiscal deficit has been equal to 40-45&#13;
percent of revenue receipts over the past three years -- the highest for any state. Interest payments on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
the state government's debt as a share of total state revenue rose from 12.5 percent in 1985/86 to 37.2&#13;
percent in 1994/95 -- the second highest among the eleven most highly populated states. Revenue&#13;
growth from state taxes has been buoyant in recent years and well above that for all states combined.&#13;
However, additional efforts will be required both to increase revenue receipts further and to restructure&#13;
expenditures if growth in social sector real expenditures is to revive. The relative wealth of the state&#13;
suggests that it will not be a problem to generate the increased revenues.&#13;
3.46   In West Bengal, the deficit on the revenue account was equal to 19 percent of revenue receipts&#13;
in 1994/95 (the highest ratio across the 15 major states). This has increased from 14 percent in&#13;
1991/92. The gross fiscal deficit is currently (1994/95) equal to 30 percent of revenue receipts.&#13;
Interest payments on the state government's debts were equal to 19.1 of revenue expenditures in March&#13;
1995. This is slightly above the average across the major states (18.0 percent). Outstanding debt is&#13;
equivalent to 22.6% of state domestic product which is slightly below the average. Efforts are&#13;
underway to improve state public finances. The fiscal deficit in 1995/96 is anticipated to be below the&#13;
previous years' and as a share of revenue receipts is planned to fall to 27%. The project will add 4.5%&#13;
to the current debt of the state Government. Further efforts to increase revenues and to alter the&#13;
structure of expenditure obviously will be necessary to reverse the relatively weak position of public&#13;
finances in general and the deteriorating situation of finances for the health sector in particular.&#13;
3.47   Revenue from User Charges. tm analysis of potential revenue generated by implementing&#13;
user charges, based on information from Kramataka, was undertaken. The analysis shows that Rs. 136&#13;
million could be generated from paying beds and wards, charges for diagno .-t tests and surgery, out-&#13;
patient charges and charges for health certificates. This is equal to about 9% of the total or about 29%&#13;
of all non-salary recurrent expenditures. This amount of additional revenue could have a significant&#13;
effect on the levels of service quality provided by first referral level hospitals. These calculations are&#13;
based on expected revenue from more rigorous implementation of the current level of charges&#13;
prevailing at first referral level hospitals. There is, however, considerable scope for enhancing the user&#13;
charges. For example, Government hospitals charge Rs. 45 and Rs. 100 for minor and major surgery&#13;
respectively compared to the average private expenditure on an episode of hospitalization in a rural&#13;
private hospital in 1986-87 of Rs. 733 (NSSO). The estimates of revenue generated are, therefore, on&#13;
the lower end of the projected range.&#13;
I. Indigenous Population&#13;
3.48    In both Karnataka, with a 4% Scheduled Tribe population, and West Bengal, with a 5.6%&#13;
Scheduled Tribe population, tribal peoples are likely to be substantial beneficiaries of the proposed&#13;
project. During project preparation, a number of workshops were held to facilitate the consultative&#13;
participation of tribal populations (see section G on Social Assessment, Annexes 13 and 14).&#13;
3.49   The project's tribal and backward areas strategy is aimed at increasing the demand for hospital&#13;
services in tribal areas by improving the quality of services and providing effective IEC to better&#13;
inform tribal populations of the benefits of using health services at secondary hospitals. The project&#13;
would: (a) strengthen linkages between primary and secondary health care services; (b) provide an&#13;
incentive package to doctors and other medical staff in tribal areas to encourage them to accept&#13;
assignment in these areas; (c) increase the appropriate utilization of non-tribal medical system by tribal&#13;
population and reduce the cost to tribals of utilizing the system. In addition, the number of beds at sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
divisional and community hospitals located in tribal areas will be increased to reflect a share of beds at&#13;
secondary hospitals that is much more commensurate with their proportion in the overall population of&#13;
the states. At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka and West Bengal provided assurances that&#13;
they would carry out the project in tribal areas in their respective states, and in the Sunderban areas of&#13;
West Bengal and amongst disadvantaged groups in Kamataka in accordance with the strategy agreed&#13;
with IDA.&#13;
J. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.50   The proposed project would not raise any environmental concerns. The project would enhance&#13;
medical waste disposal at health facilities where necessary. A plan for improving disposal of medical&#13;
wastes has been provided by each state.&#13;
K. Land Acquisition&#13;
3.51   The process of acquisition of additional land, where required, for the extension of existing&#13;
hospitals has been initiated and most sites have been made available. IDA has been assured that none&#13;
of the sites for hospital upgradation would entail involuntary resettlement of any persons.&#13;
L. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.52   The project would be subject to normal Government accounting and auditing procedures which&#13;
are considered acceptable to IDA. At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West&#13;
Bengal provided assurances that: (i) project accounts would be maintained and audited annually in&#13;
accordance with sound auditing standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA; and (ii) certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with&#13;
the auditor's report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to IDA no later&#13;
than nine months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1    A major benefit of the proposed project is that it will assist the states of Karnataka, Punjab and&#13;
West Bengal to put in place a coherent approach to establishing a cost-effective and sustainable health&#13;
system. This would indirectly benefit the states' population as a whole. First, the broader sectoral&#13;
policy reforms envisaged under the proposed project such as improvements in health planning capacity,&#13;
management effectiveness, allocation of public resources for health, and enhanced role of the private&#13;
sector would increase the efficiency of the health sector by improving the enviromnent in which the&#13;
health sector operates and by optimizing resource use. Second, there would be substantial cost savings&#13;
in each state through the implementation of streamlined service norms and rationalization of service&#13;
provision at different levels of health care delivery. Morever, the technical and quality improvements,&#13;
including operations and maintenance functions, at the institutional and health facility levels will&#13;
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of health care services by encouraging patients to seek timely&#13;
care resulting in higher cure rates at lower costs. Third, those currently utilizing existing services&#13;
would benefit from better quality of care. In addition, there would be other qualitative benefits which&#13;
would have a significant impact on the health system. For example, the strengthening and upgrading of&#13;
first referral facilities would lend vital support and credibility to the primary health care system for&#13;
implementing the various priority health programs and provide basic health care in rural areas. An&#13;
adequately functioning referral mechanism would also improve the effectiveness of the primary health&#13;
care level and encourage a greater participation of the private sector in health care. Moreover, there&#13;
are considerable externalities associated with reducing public health hazards through improvements in&#13;
waste disposal methods and through improvements in the surveillance system for major comnnunicable&#13;
diseases. Finally, the proposed project will have a direct impact on improving the health status of the&#13;
people of each state by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability and thus increase the earning&#13;
potential of the poor.&#13;
4.2    Project Beneficiaries. In addition to systemic benefits which would indirectly benefit the&#13;
populations of the states of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal, noted in para. 4.1, the project would&#13;
directly benefit approximately 10 million out-patients and 0.7 million in-patients currently utilizing&#13;
existing hospital services in the three states through the provision of better quality of care. In addition,&#13;
the project is expected to directly benefit an estimated 3.3 million incremental out-patients in West&#13;
Bengal, 1.2 million in Karnataka, and 0.7 million in Punjab; and an estimated 0.4 million incremental&#13;
in-patients in West Bengal, 0.3 million in Karnataka and 0.12 million in Punjab. This analysis on&#13;
incremental in-patients is based on the following assumptions: (i) incremental patients at secondary&#13;
hospitals do not include those expected to be diverted from tertiary hospitals; (ii) occupancy rate of&#13;
80% in West Bengal, 64% in Karnataka, and 60% in Punjab at pre-project and is assumed to increase&#13;
to 100%, 82% and 78% in West Bengal, Kamataka, and Punjab, respectively at project completion;&#13;
(iii) the average length of stay is 12 days in West Bengal, 15 in Karnataka and 12 in Punjab pre-project&#13;
and is assumed to decline to 8, 10 and 8 in West Bengal, Karnataka and Punjab, respectively at project&#13;
completion; and (iv) a corrective factor is used that assumes that a third of all in-patients are&#13;
hospitalized about 2.5 times annually based on hospital data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
4.3    Cost Effectiveness Analysis. The project is not suitable for a cost-benefit type analysis&#13;
because of the difficulty in quantifying benefits and data limitations. However, a micro-level analysis,&#13;
based on detailed hospital level cost data, was undertaken to show the possible cost savings of treating&#13;
patients at secondary level facilities rather than at tertiary hospitals (see Annex 4). Analysis comparing&#13;
cost-effectiveness between different types of hospitals is limited in India, because of the unavailability&#13;
of data. Previous analysis has shown that at least a third of all costs could be saved by treting patients&#13;
at first referral facilities rather than at tertiary level facilities. However, due to variations in the case-&#13;
mix, such analysis did not compare cost-effectiveness at first referral and tertiary hospitals. The&#13;
following is an illustrative example of the type of cost savings that would result from the project&#13;
investment. To estimate cost savings of treating patients at secondary level hospitals, a preliminary&#13;
analysis of the overall profile of unit costs related to specific inputs for in-patients and out-patients was&#13;
undertaken. A comparison was made between a tertiary level hospital and a first referral level hospital&#13;
in Hyderabad where comparable data based on a similar case-mix was available. Both hospitals had a&#13;
similar case-mix of ante-natal, intra-natal, family planning and gynaecological services. Since both&#13;
hospitals provided in-patient and out-patient services, a comprehensive index which captures both types&#13;
of services was used to estimate at unit costs (the day equivalent method). It was found that the day&#13;
equivalent4 at first referral hospitals was about two-thirds that of a tertiary hospitals - Rs. 115&#13;
compared to Rs. 160. The difference was largely because of greater unit cost of infrastructure and&#13;
overheads at tertiary hospitals. This analysis provides an indicative example of cost savings that can&#13;
result from the strengthening and rationalization of health services across different tiers of the health&#13;
system.&#13;
B. Program Objective Categories&#13;
4.4    Poverty Aspects. A large proportion of project beneficiaries will be from the poor and&#13;
underprivileged segments of the states' population. In West Bengal, the beneficiary assessment study&#13;
found that nearly 70% of expected project beneficiary would belong to i re lo.ver 40% of income&#13;
distribution. In Kamataka, the analysis found that over 45% of the patients liave an annual income&#13;
below Rs. 15,000 (close to the official poverty line) and over 90% of the patients have an annual&#13;
income below the taxable level of Rs. 50,000. In Punjab, a relatively large share of the investment&#13;
under the project is targeted in the Upper Bari Doab region where 30% of the overall population and&#13;
40% of the rural population live below the poverty line; and the Southern Malwa region where rural&#13;
poverty is about 25%. Based on this data, the proposed project is classified as a Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions (PTI).&#13;
4.5    Gender Issues. In general, the project would provide much greater access to women,&#13;
particularly rural women, and improve the quality of services they receive. More specifically, by&#13;
strengthening the referral mechanism and linking the community hospitals with prunary health centers,&#13;
the project would assist in providing timely access to emergency obstetric care. The project would also&#13;
promote a life-cycle approach to women's health, taking into account some of the main&#13;
recommendations of the Cairo Conference on women's reproductive health, such as screening RTIs and&#13;
STDs, providing appropriate IEC to promote the value of the girl-child, and increasing women's&#13;
awareness of their options in terms of health care.&#13;
4The day equivalent method equates one in-patient day with four out-patient visits (Barnum and Kutzin,&#13;
Public Hospitals in Developing Countries; Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
4.6    The proposed project carries several risks that are associated with PHN projects in general in&#13;
India such as poor procurement, late disbursement, untimely and inadequate flow of funds, poor&#13;
maintenance of building and equipment and inadequate attention to software and qualitative aspects.&#13;
Most of these risks have been substantially reduced through careful project design. There are two&#13;
additional risks associated with this project. Institutional. The capacity of existing institutions to&#13;
undertake systemic improvements and to establish a more rational health delivery system has not been&#13;
tested in India. Institutional strengthening would be emphasized in the proposed project to address this&#13;
risk. In Punjab, the newly formed PHSC might experience some start-up problems. The Government of&#13;
Punjab, at the highest level, has made a commitment to enable the PHSC to effectively implenent the&#13;
project. Financial. As with other projects in India, the overall financial status of the states is a risk.&#13;
The position of public finances in Karnataka and recent trends in expenditure on health both suggest&#13;
that the project's incremental recurrent costs are sustainable. In Punjab and West Bengal however,&#13;
continuation of recent trends in health expenditures would not be sufficient to absorb the incremental&#13;
costs. In both cases the rate of growth of health expenditures in recent years has been below the growth&#13;
rate of overall expenditure. There are, however, various measures which will help reduce the risk to&#13;
financial sustainability significantly. The state Governments are comnitted to ensure that health&#13;
expenditures will be maintained at least as a constant share of overall expenditures throughout the life&#13;
of the project. In the case of Punjab. the necessary resources needed to sustain this commitment can be&#13;
mobilized with small increase in revenue. In the case of West Bengal, some reorientation of its fiscal&#13;
policies may be required to ensure sustainability. An on-going mechanism for monitoring the financial&#13;
sustainability of the states was discussed at negotiations. Understanding was reached that as part of&#13;
the project's comprehensive mid-term review, there would be a review of overall state finances, as well&#13;
as the financial situation of the health sector. If necessary, additional measures to achieve financial&#13;
sustainablity of project benefits would be agreed based on results of that review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1    At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and the Punjab Health&#13;
Systems Corporation provided assurances that they would:&#13;
(a)    ensure that: (i) the share of resources to the primary and secondary levels of health&#13;
care in the total resources (Plan and Non-plan) allocated to the health sector would be&#13;
increased each year until the year 2002; and allocate adequate resources for drugs, essential&#13;
supplies and maintenance of equipment and buildings at first referral hospitals in accordance&#13;
with norms agreed with IDA (paras. 2.9-2.10);&#13;
(b)    maintain a Strategic Planning Cell with adequate staff, resources and terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA (para. 2.11);&#13;
(c)   take all necessary actions to ensure that the DOHFW in Kamataka and West Bengal&#13;
and PHSC in Punjab would maintain authority in managing essential operational activities&#13;
including civil works construction and maintenance activities (para. 2.12);&#13;
(d)    ensure that: (i) the arrangements for the management and collection of user charges&#13;
approved prior to negotaitions would be maintained; (ii) user charges would be implemented in&#13;
a phased manner after improvements in the quality of basic services and infrastructure&#13;
development have been completed; (iii) the agreed mechanism for exempting the poor from&#13;
user fees would remain in place; and (iv) in Karnataka and West Bengal, the system for&#13;
reallocation of funds collected at the hospital level, to be retained and reallocated based on&#13;
need and level of revenue collection by the District Health Committees, would be maintained.&#13;
In Punjab, regulations on user charges would stipulate that funds collected would be retained&#13;
at the point of collection (paras. 2.16-2.18);&#13;

PUBLIC EXPENDITURES ON THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
I.     The purpose of this appendix is twofold. First, it presents the past trends in selected aspects of public&#13;
finances in general and expenditures on health and family welfare services in particular in the three project&#13;
states of Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal. As part of the exercise, total health expenditures have been&#13;
disaggregated and re-classified by level of service. This analysis then formns the base for a limnited exploration&#13;
of the burden of the incremental recurrent recurrent costs of the project for each state, the resulting shifts in the&#13;
structure of health expenditure and the conditions for financial sustainability.&#13;
State Finances&#13;
2.     Trends in the level and composition of public expenditures on health and family welfare should be&#13;
seen against the backdrop of the overall developments in state government finances - both prior to the&#13;
economic and fiscal crises of 1991/92 and during the period of adjustment. Through the 1980s, overall state&#13;
governnent revenues grew at a slower rate than expenditures leading to the emergence of revenue deficits and&#13;
the growth and changing composition of fiscal deficits. In the more recent period, state finances have been&#13;
influenced both by the nature of macroeconomic adjustment, which affects overall tax revenues, and by fiscal&#13;
adjustment by the Central government which has affected the size of the Central governnent's transfers to&#13;
states, in particular the grant component.&#13;
3.      The combined gross fiscal deficit of the states was equal to 3.0 percent of GDP in 1986/87 and to&#13;
3.2 percent in 1993/94. Calculations of individual state deficits as a proportion of their own state domestic&#13;
product suggest that for the eleven most populated states the average increased slightly from 4.2 to 4.3&#13;
percent betxveen 1990/91 and 1994/95. Differences between statcs, however, are quite substantial. Table I&#13;
presents the data for the three project states, Karnataka, Punjab and Wcst Bengal from 1990/91 to 1993/94.&#13;
In each, the deficit has fallen as a share of state income but it has been significantly higher in Punjab than in&#13;
cither West Bengal or Karnataka.&#13;

Note: Measurement of state domestic product may differ slightly between states. This may affect comparisons between states but&#13;
not trends within states. No estimate of SDP for Punjab in 1993/94 is available.&#13;
4. The gross fiscal deficit largely reflects the combined balances in the revenue and capital accounts.&#13;
Between 1980/81 and 1986/87 a deficit on the aggregate states' revenue account occurred in only one year.&#13;
Since then, deficits have occurred in each year. Although trends in the revenue deficit are unfavorable for all&#13;
states combined, the position of individual states again is far from uniform. Kamataka has had relatively&#13;
small revenue deficits in recent years and estimates for 1993/94 suggest a small surplus (Table 2). As a&#13;
percentage of Net State Domestic Product (SDP), the revenue deficit/surplus was -0.6% in 1991/92 and&#13;
+0.6% in 1993/94. Punjab has had more substantial revenue deficits, both in absolute terms and as a share of&#13;
SDP. In 1991/92 and 1992/93, they were equal to -2.4% and -2.2% of SDP respectively. The revenue deficits&#13;
of West Bengal have also increased since 1989/90 though not to the extent as in Punjab.&#13;

5.     As a consequence of increased revenue deficits in general, the nature of the fiscal deficit, and hence the&#13;
borrowing requirement, has changed. Whereas, previously, borrowing had been required only for covering&#13;
deficits in the capital account, by 1994/95 over a quarter of the borrowing was to cover deficits in the revenue&#13;
account.   This indicator is particularly revealing of the financial health of state governments, since it&#13;
represents the pre-emption of borrowed funds for meeting current expenditures. In Punjab, the revenue deficit&#13;
contributed over 50% of the GFD in 1992/93 and was budgeted to be about 34% in 1994/95. In West Bengal,&#13;
the revenue deficit was 43% of GFD in 1992/93 and was scheduled to rise to over 62% in 1994/95. In&#13;
Karnataka, the revenue deficit was 12 percent of the GFD in 1992/93 but made no contribution to the fiscal&#13;
deficit in the following two years.&#13;
6.     Of the three states, the overall state finances of West Bcneal and Puniab seem to be most precarious.&#13;
Kamataka has a relatively comfortable budgetary position compared to the two other states. Some further&#13;
consideration is given to these issues in the final section of the anncx.&#13;
Trends in Expenditure on Health and Family Welfare&#13;
7.    In all three project states, government health and family welfarc cxpenditures are well below the&#13;
intemational norm that is considered adequatc to meet public hcalth priorities (World Development Report&#13;
1993); and below the levels required to achieve the service norms set by the Government of India (India:&#13;
Policy and Finance Strategies for Strengthening Primary Health Care Services). Punjab spends less than 0.9%&#13;
of state domestic product (SDP), Kamataka about 1.3% and W. Bengal about 1.1% (Table 3). In addition,&#13;
compared to the early and mid 1980s the shares have declined in two of the three states. The decline has been&#13;
especially steep in West Bengal, where health expenditures fell from around 1.5% of SDP in 1980/81 to 1.0%&#13;
in 1992/93; and is estimated to be about 1.16% in 1993/94. In Punjab, the share dropped from around 1.1% of&#13;
SDP in 1980/81 to 0.9% in 1992/93. In Karnataka, the share is back at the same level as in the early 1980s (at&#13;
around 1.3% of SDP).&#13;

8. Per Capita Expenditures on Health. Measures of aggregate resources devoted to public sector health&#13;
programs do not convey the absolute levels of real expenditure per capita (Table 4). Despite the relatively&#13;
low share of public resources devoted to health in Punjab, real per capita expenditures have been the highest of&#13;
the three states and have been maintained at roughly the same level since 1980/81 (between Rs. 30-35 per year&#13;
at 1.980/81 prices). Per capita expenditures which were lowest in Kamataka - between Rs 20-25 per year at&#13;
constant prices during the 1980's have risen since 1991-92 to around Rs. 30. West Bengal displays the most&#13;
disturbing trend. The fall in real expenditures per capita has become pronounced in recent years (from Rs. 25&#13;
per year in 1980/81 and Rs. 26 in 1990/91 to Rs. 22 per year in 1993/94).&#13;

9.     Despite these differences between the three states, the per capita expenditures in all three states are&#13;
low. In 1993/94, per capita expenditure at current prices was Rs. 100 in Punjab, Rs. 90 in Karnataka and Rs.&#13;
72 in West Bengal (between US$ 2-3 per capita). These expenditures are well below the norms required for&#13;
the minimum package of health services as described in the World Development Report, 1993. They are also&#13;
substantially below the norms set by GOI, which would require a 50 percent increase in budgetary allocations&#13;
over the current level (India: Policy and Finance Strategies for Strengthening Primary Health Care Services,&#13;
Grey Cover Report No. 13042-IN, May 15, 1995).&#13;
10.    Effects of Fiscal Adiustment on Health Budgets. Spending on health and family welfare grew at&#13;
around 12-13% per annum in nominal terms in the three states between 1980/81 and 1990/91. In real terms,&#13;
annual growth rates were in the range of 2.8% to 4.4%. Expenditures grew most rapidly in Kamataka,&#13;
followed by Punjab and West Bengal (Table 5).&#13;
11.   The consequences of the economic and financial difficulties at the start of the 1990s and the resulting&#13;
adjustment measures have differed across the three states. In West Bengal and Punjab, cxpenditures fell in real&#13;
terms in the first year of adjustment. While there has been a partial recovery in Punjab, the level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71                                      Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
expenditures previously attained in West Bengal have yet to be regained. Expenditures fell by 16% in real&#13;
terms in 1991/92. Although the growth rate increased in subsequent years, the absolute level of real&#13;
expenditures in 1993/94 was still below that of 1990/91. In Punjab, the nominal growth rate in 1991/92 was&#13;
positive, but real expenditures fell by almost 4%. Real growth in subsequent years was very small so that&#13;
again the level in 1993/94 was (slightly) below that in 1990/91. Karnataka, on the other hand, has sustained&#13;
high growth rates both in nominal and real terms, resulting in higher real expenditures in 1993/94 when&#13;
compared to those attained in 1990/91.&#13;
12.   It would appear, therefore, that the effects of the fiscal crisis and the consequent adjustment measures&#13;
on the overall budgetary position of Punjab and West Bengal were passed on to the health budget resulting in a&#13;
decline in real expenditures. Given the relatively low level of expenditures on health particularly in West&#13;
Bengal, these trends are of concern. Special mechanisms may be required to protect and raise the level of real&#13;
expenditures on health in these two states.&#13;
13.     Share of Budgetary Resources Devoted to Health. Health and Family Welfare budgets in the three&#13;
states generally absorbed less than 10% of the total state revenue budgets throughout the 1980's (Table 6). In&#13;
each state the share has declined over time suggesting that during the period of adjustment past trends have&#13;
been exacerbated, rather than reversed. This decline in shares occurred despite the rise in real per capita&#13;
expenditures in all states up to 1990/91, indicating that total state government expenditures rose even faster&#13;
than health expenditures. Since 1990, the budget share has increased in Kamataka (from 6.1 to 6.4%), but&#13;
fallen further in West Bengal (from 8.4 to 7.2%) and in Punjab (from 6.6 to 5.3%).&#13;

Composition of the Health Budgets&#13;
14.   The allocation of spending between primary, secondary and tertiary level facilities and services is not&#13;
readily available in state budget documents. The approximate shares can be obtained only by reclassifying&#13;
individual line items. This exercise has been undertaken in varying degrees for each state.&#13;
15..   West Bengal. The total health budget in West Bengal for the years 1989/90 to 1994/95 has been re-&#13;
classified under five heads: (i) primary health care, (ii) rural hospitals and dispensaries, (iii) urban health care&#13;
facilities, (iv) items of general expenditure and (v) medical education (Table 7). Primary care comprises&#13;
expenditure on public health, family welfare, rural health services (allopathic and non-allopathic) and urban&#13;
non-allopathic services. Expenditure on Employee's State Insurance has been placed under urban health care&#13;
facilities since the scheme covers workers in the organised sector of industry, which is mainly located in urban&#13;
areas.&#13;

16.    According to this reclassification, primary health care absorbed around 40% of the health budget in&#13;
1989/90 and this share has been maintained subsequently. The share for urban (secondary and tertiary)&#13;
facilities increased from 40% to 43.5%. The share for medical education and training also rose marginally&#13;
from 6% to 7.5% in 1994/95.&#13;
17.    Rural hospitals and dispensaries (the Community Health Centres) have received the lowest share of&#13;
expenditures and this has been reduced almost by half since 1989/90 (from 3.9% in 1989/90 to 2.2% in&#13;
1994/95). Recent sector work has demonstrated that there is considerable underfunding nationally of this&#13;
segment of the health services in relation to both needs and prescribed norms (India: Policy and Finance&#13;
Strategies for Strengthening Primary Health Care Services). Moreover, it appears that these services have been&#13;
under the greatest pressure in recent years.&#13;
18.    The share of general expenditures has also decreased, from 10% to 7.5%. This is almost entirely due&#13;
to the reduction in the share for medical stores and depots, which declined from 6.4% to 3.8%. Thus, in&#13;
addition to rural hospitals, expenditure on drugs and other consumables has also borne the brunt of&#13;
expenditure contraction during the period of adjustment.&#13;
19.   In order to determine the broad allocation of resources across different categories of inputs and&#13;
different levels of hospital services, the composition of non-plan expenditures on hospitals and dispensaries in&#13;
West Bengal during the last three years was examined. Urban hospitals were divided into two categories,&#13;
tertiary and secondary. Hospitals in metropolitan centers and speciality hospitals were designated as tertiary,&#13;
while all district urban hospitals were designated as secondary. The results are presented in Table 8. The level&#13;
of expenditure on urban secondary and tertiary hospitals is broadly similar. Expenditure on rural secondary&#13;
hospitals is only one ninth of that on urban secondary hospitals.&#13;
20.   In urban tertiary hospitals, salaries and wages account for about two-thirds of revenue expenditure.&#13;
Although there was a slight reduction in 1993/94 (to about 60%), the budgeted sharc rosc to 65% in 1994/95.&#13;
Expenditure on materials and supplies (including drugs) comprise around 9-10% of the total, although again&#13;
there was a slight dip in 1993/94. Machinery and equipment absorbed over 5 % of the total in 1992/93 and&#13;
4.7% in 1993/94. Expcnditure on diet rose from less than 6% to 9%. Expenditurc on maintenance has been&#13;
negligible, but this understates the overall maintenance expenditure on buildings which is included in the&#13;
budget of the Public Works Department. The remaining share of expenditure is absorbed by overhead costs&#13;
and by aid to non-government hospitals (about 10% and 3-4%, respectively).&#13;
21.    The expenditure pattern is broadly simnilar in urban secondary hospitals, with about 75% going&#13;
towards salaries. Apparently, expenditure on materials and supplies fell quite dramatically in 1992/93 (to less&#13;
than 5%), rising to around 9% in subsequent years. Expenditure on machinery and equipment is 2%, while&#13;
expenditure on diet has increased to about 7%. It would appear that in urban secondary hospitals, the share of&#13;
salaries was protected with the budget cuts of 1992/93 borne by drugs and consumables.&#13;
22.   In rural secondary hospitals, the share of materials and supplies fell to 1% of the total in 1992/93,&#13;
while the share of salaries was 75%. In the following two years, however, the share of salaries and wages was&#13;
brought down drastically to less than 60%; salary expenditure actually fell in absolute tcrms, probably&#13;
indicating that vacancics were not filled. The share spent on materials and supplies rose to over 12%.&#13;
However, since the absolute expenditures on rural hospitals hardly increased in this period (and real&#13;
expenditures fell), the rise in the share does not indicate any significant improvement in availability of drugs&#13;
and consumables though it does indicate an attempt to restore the le.els of spending attained earlier.&#13;

primary health, family welfare, secondary and tertiary health, medical education and training, and&#13;
administration. The percentage distributions from 1990/91 to 1994/95 are described in Table 9.&#13;

24.     Throughout the period, primary health care and family welfare have absorbed around 53 percent of&#13;
the total health budget. Secondary and tertiary care combined have absorbed betwecn 33 and 36 percent and&#13;
medical education and training, around 10 percent. The most notable change in shares has been for family&#13;
welfare. For this activity, nominal expenditures increased by 23 percent a year compared to the lowest growth&#13;
rate of 16 percent for secondary and tertiary care and 18 percent for primary health care. It is of interest to&#13;
note that family welfare is a 100% centrally sponsored scheme.&#13;
&#13;

Page 9 of 12&#13;
25.     Complicating the disaggregation of allocations in Karnataka is the substantial degree of&#13;
decentralisation to the district councils (Zilla Parishads) While most of the health functions of the councils&#13;
relate to primary health care and family welfare, they also include community and some district hospitals.&#13;
From a review of the budgets of one Zilla Parishad from 1990/91 to 1994/95, the share for these facilities&#13;
appears to have fallen from 23 percent to 5 percent. If this is typical, the rural hospitals in Karnataka have&#13;
been under severe and increasing pressure similar to the apparent case in West Bengal.&#13;
26.     Punjab. Health expenditures for Punjab were re-classified under primary, secondary and tertiary&#13;
health care. Primary care was defined as including primary health centers, sub-centers, services from non-&#13;
allopathic systems of medicine (apart from teaching), family welfare (apart from MCH, included at the&#13;
secondary level), disease control programs, drug control, public health laboratories and paramedical training.&#13;
Secondary care includes MCH, community health centers and district hospitals. Tertiary care covers the&#13;
teaching hospitals. The composition of health expenditures between these three levels of service is described in&#13;
Table 10. According to the breakdown, an average of 61 per cent of expenditures are allocated to primary&#13;
care, 27 percent to secondary and 12 percent to tertiary. Over the five year period, however, some changes&#13;
have occurred. The shares for primary and tertiary health care have fallen by 5 and 1.5 percentage points&#13;
respectively while the share for secondary care has increased by 6.5 percentage points.&#13;

27.     The data prepared for Punjab also allow for some analysis of items of expenditure. For each level of&#13;
care, salary items dominate. In 1994, salaries absorbed 77, 70 and 67 percent of primary, secondary and&#13;
tertiary care expenditures. Materials, supplies and cquipment absorbed 10, 25 and 18 percent respectively.&#13;
Over time, there are no clear trends in these distributions.&#13;
Project Financial Sustainability&#13;
28.      The project's financial sustainability depends on the ability and willingness of the state governments&#13;
both to conmmit resources for the continuation of project activities at the end of the project period and to&#13;
support adequately those non-project activities upon which the project activities depend. The level of recurring&#13;
costs and the level, composition and trend in health expenditure will have an important bearing on financial&#13;
sustainability. Because of the size of the project in each state, some consideration of the states' overall public&#13;
finances are required.&#13;
29.    Karnataka. The incremental recurring costs of the project, including contingencies, at the end of the&#13;
project period are estimated at Rs. 360 million. In 1994/95, total revenue expenditures in the Department of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare were Rs. 4,872 million. Since 1991/92 these have been increasing at a real rate of&#13;
9 percent a year. Over the previous decade, expenditures rose by 4.4 percent a year. Assuming continuation of&#13;
the overall trend since 1980/81 (5.2 percent) , expenditures in the year following the end of the project will be&#13;
around Rs. 6,950 million. Incremental recurring costs of the project will be equal to 5.2 percent of total&#13;
expenditures of DOHFW and 100 percent of the total trend departmental incremental expenditures in that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                                      Annex 3&#13;
Page 10 of 12&#13;
year. If the incremental recurrent costs of the project were to be funded in addition to the 'normal' increase&#13;
this would imply an increased share for health of total government revenue expenditures of around 0.3&#13;
percentage points (from a current level of 6.4 percent).&#13;
30.    In practice, the incremental costs are likely to be met partly through the trend increase and partially&#13;
through additional resources allocated to the sector. While the incremental project costs are clearly sustainable&#13;
on the basis on maintenance of past trends in overall departmental expenditure, they would lead to some&#13;
restructuring of overall health allocations in the absence of a significant proportional increase in expenditures&#13;
at the secondary health level. (While not all of the project expenditures are for secondary health activities, the&#13;
majority are. The same is true for Punjab and West Bengal). An approximate calculation of expenditure on&#13;
secondary health in 1994/95 suggests a total of Rs. 848 million. Projecting this forvard to the end of the&#13;
project period at a real rate of growth of 5.2 percent a year, expenditures would be Rs. 1,209 million. If&#13;
project incremental expenditures were financed in addition to the trend increase in health allocations, these&#13;
would add 30 percent to the total expenditures on secondary health and would be equal to over five times the&#13;
'normal' increment in that year. (In fact, such a sharp jump would not occur in one year since part of the&#13;
incremental recurrent cost burden e.g. salaries, will be funded on an increasing basis through the project's life&#13;
by the state). Assuming no other changes in the composition of health expenditures, the allocation to secondary&#13;
health would increase from around 17 to 22 percent of the total.&#13;
31.    Is there any reason to expect that the high growth rates of health expenditures over the past fifteen&#13;
years cannot be maintained as a result of deterioration in the states overall financial position? The revenue&#13;
account in 1993/94 was in surplus. The gross fiscal deficit is equivalent to 17 percent of revenues - one of the&#13;
smallest among the major states. Interest payments on debt accounted for 11.6 percent of total revenue&#13;
expenditures in 1992/93 rising to 12.7 percent in 1994/95. Public debt was equal to 26.3 percent of state&#13;
domestic product in 1990/91 and to 27.0 percent in 1994/95. The indicators of public finances in Karnataka&#13;
show some slight deterioration over the past few years as a result of incrcased borrowing for capital&#13;
expenditures but overall demonstrate a picture of reasonable strcngth.&#13;
32.    The financial implications of the project for the statc govcrnment includc the neccssity to scrvice the&#13;
loan, as well as the incremcntal recurring expenditure. Including contingencics the projected loan is Rs. 6,458&#13;
million - this represents 4.7 percent of the currcnt outstanding debt of the state government. Given the&#13;
currently relatively low share of interest payments in total revenue expenditurcs (second to lowest among the&#13;
eleven major states) the additional burden arising from this project should be manageable.&#13;
33.    Puniab. Punjab is India's wealthiest state with per capita income twice that of West Bengal and 1.7&#13;
times that of Karnataka. The incremental recurring costs of the project at the end of the project period are&#13;
estimated at Rs. 150 million. Total expenditure on health in 1993/94 was Rs. 2,202 million. Through the&#13;
1980s real expenditures on health increased by an average 4.3% a year. Bctween 1991 and 1993 real&#13;
expenditures fell and growth since then has been marginal. Assuming that expenditure growth recovers to&#13;
1980s levels, total health expenditures in the year following the end of the project wvill be Rs. 2956 million.&#13;
Incremental recurring costs of the project will be equal to 5.1 percent of total expenditures and around 1.2&#13;
times the annual addition to departmental expenditure. However, the growth trend in total state government&#13;
revenue expenditure since 1990/91 has been around 5.5 percent a year. If in the future, the share of health&#13;
expenditure in total expenditures can be maintained and the latter continue to increase by the recent growth&#13;
rate of 5.5 percent a year then the total hcalth allocation at the end of the project period would be Rs. 3,203&#13;
million with an annual increment of Rs. 176 million - almost 20 percent higher than the project's incremental&#13;
cost in that year. If the incremental cost of the project is financed in addition to 'normal' increases, the share of&#13;
health in total revenue expenditures would increase by 0.2 percent (from a current level of 5.3 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                      Annex 3&#13;
Page 11 of 12&#13;
34.    If the share of health expenditures in total expenditures is maintained together with the increases in&#13;
overall expenditures at least at the trend of the 1980s, the project's sustainability should be attainable.&#13;
Financing incremental recurrent project costs through the 'normal' growth in allocations would, however, lead&#13;
to some change in the structure of health expenditure. Currently, secondary health services consume roughly&#13;
30 percent of the total, or around Rs. 660 million (with 58 percent for primary care). Projecting these&#13;
expenditures to the end of the project period (assuming a constant share of total expenditure for health and&#13;
continuation of the 1980s trend in total expenditures) the allocation would be Rs. 960 million with a 'normal'&#13;
increase in that year of Rs. 63 million. The required project incremental expenditure would be almost two and&#13;
a half times as large. Hence the need for reallocation. Assuming no other changes in the composition of health&#13;
expenditures, the allocation to secondary health would increase from the current 30 percent to 34.5 percent.&#13;
35.    How feasible is the assumption of overall revenue growth in the state being equal to the level of the&#13;
1980s? The deficit on the revenue account was estimated at 13.5 percent of revenue receipts in 1994/95 and&#13;
to 23 and 24 percent in the two previous years. The gross fiscal deficit has been equal to 40-45 percent of&#13;
revenue receipts over the past three years - the highest for any state. Interest payments on the state&#13;
government's debt as a share of total state revenue rose from 12.5 percent in 1985/86 to 37.2 percent in&#13;
1994/95 - the second highest among the eleven most highly populated states. Revenue growth from state taxes&#13;
has been buoyant in recent years and well above that for all states combined. However, additional efforts will&#13;
be required both to increase revenue receipts further and to restructure expenditures if growth in social sector&#13;
real expenditures is to revive. The relative wealth of the state suggests that increased revenues should be&#13;
possible to generate.&#13;
36.    West Bengal . The incremental recurring expenditures at the end of the project period are estimated at&#13;
Rs. 250 million. The total revenue allocation for the Health Department in 1995/96 is Rs. 5,570 million. Real&#13;
growvth rates in health expenditure through the 1980s averaged 2.8 percent a year. In 1991/92 real&#13;
expenditures fell by 14 percent. Since then they have risen by an average of 2.9% a year. Assumning a&#13;
continuation of this trend, revenue expenditures in the year following the end of the project will be Rs. 6,803&#13;
million with a 'normal' increment in that year of Rs. 197 million. Project incremental recurring costs would bc&#13;
just over 3.7% of total revenue expenditures on health or around 1.25 times the 'normal' increment. However,&#13;
ovcrall trends in government revenue expenditures in recent years have been above those in health. If, in future&#13;
years, the health sector maintains its share of total expenditures and the trend in total expenditures over the&#13;
past three years is maintained (7.9 percent), the health allocation in 2001 would be Rs. 8,790 million, with a&#13;
'normal' increase of around Rs. 694 million. Project incremental costs would then be equal to 36 % of the&#13;
'normal' annual increase. The incremental project costs imply an increased share of total government revenue&#13;
expenditure for the health department of 0.3% (the current share is 7.2%).&#13;
37.   In order for the project incremental expenditures to be accommodated relatively easily at the end of the&#13;
project without a sudden large increase, the share of overall health expenditures should increase at a rate at&#13;
least as fast as total revenue expenditures. If that occurs, the costs should be sustainable. If the growth rate of&#13;
health sector allocations was to continue to be substantially below that of overall expenditures, the question of&#13;
project sustainability would be more ambiguous.&#13;
38.    The project is likely to result in an increased share of health expenditures for secondary level services&#13;
(unless overall expenditures increase at a very rapid level). Expenditurc on secondary health in 1994/95 was&#13;
equal to 25 percent of total health expenditures, around Rs. 1,400 million (with 45 percent for primary care).&#13;
Maintaining a constant share of total government expenditures at the recent trend rate would lead to an&#13;
allocation of Rs. 2,384 million at the end of the project period. If project incremental costs were financed in&#13;
addition to the trend increase, these would add an additional 10 percent to this total and the share of secondary&#13;
services would increase to almost 30 percent of total health expenditures million. To the extent that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                                        Annex 3&#13;
Page 12 of 12&#13;
incremental expenditures are financed through the nornal trend increase, the share for secondary services&#13;
would increase further.&#13;
39.    How feasible are the assumptions regarding increases in health sector financing? The deficit on the&#13;
revenue account was equal to 19 percent of revenue receipts in 1994/95 (the highest ratio across the 15 major&#13;
states). This has increased from 14 percent in 1991/92. The gross fiscal deficit is currently (1994/95) equal to&#13;
30 percent of revenue receipts. Interest payments on the state government's debts were equal to 19.1 of revenue&#13;
expenditures in March 1995. This is slightly above the average across the major states (18.0 percent).&#13;
Outstanding debt is equivalent to 22.6% of state domestic product which is slightly below the average. Efforts&#13;
are underway to improve state public finances. The fiscal deficit in 1995/96 is anticipated to be below the&#13;
previous years' and as a share of revenue receipts is planned to fall to 27%. Further efforts to increase&#13;
revenues and to alter the structure of expenditure obviously will be necessary to reverse the relatively weak&#13;
position of public finances in general and the deteriorating situation of finances for the health sector in&#13;
particular.&#13;
40.    The project will add 4.5 percent to the current debt of the state government (Rs. 5,969/13,081&#13;
million).&#13;
41.    Summarv. The position of public finances in Karnataka and rccent trends in expenditure on health&#13;
both suggest that the project's incremental recurrent costs are sustainable. In Punjab and West Bengal,&#13;
however, continuation of recent trends in health expenditures would not be sufficient to absorb the incremental&#13;
costs. In both cases, the rate of growth of health expenditures in recent years has been below the growth rate&#13;
of overall expenditure. If health expenditures can be maintained at least as a constant share of overall&#13;
expenditures throughout the life of the project, the risks of sustainability would decrease significantly. Punjab&#13;
and West Bengal will need to enhance their contributions to the health scctor. In the case of Punjab, the&#13;
necessary resourccs needed to sustain this commnitment can be mobilised with small increasc in tax effort. In&#13;
the case of West Bengal, some reoricntation of its fiscal policies may be required to cnsure sustainability.&#13;

compared to a tertiary hospital. It deals specifically with two issues: (i) the overall unit costs related to&#13;
specific inputs for in-patients and out-patients at first referral versus tertiary hospitals; and (ii) costs&#13;
and efficiency comparisons of first referral versus tertiary level hospitals for a sample of interventions.&#13;
One of the rationales for the project from an economic efficiency point of view is that the unit costs of&#13;
treatment can be reduced considerably by providing health care services at lower level facilities where&#13;
unit costs for comparable services are lower. The analysis in this Annex will, therefore, test whether&#13;
this hypothesis is true; and if it is accurate, what would be the approximate magnitude of the cost&#13;
savings if diagnosis and treatment of conditions that are possible to be addressed at secondary level&#13;
facilities are indeed taken care of at that level, rather than at the tertiary level.&#13;
2.     During project preparation, service norms at different level facilities throughout the system&#13;
were streamlined and rationalized in each of the three states. This will make it possible to provide&#13;
diagnosis and treatment services at an appropriate level facility in a cost-effective manner. Therefore,&#13;
the "without" project scenario is one in which a substantial number of diagnosis and treatment services&#13;
would continue to be done at tertiary hospitals; and the "with" project scenario is one in which many of&#13;
these services can be performed at first referral hospitals.&#13;
3.     Analysis comparing cost-effectiveness betwveen different typcs of hospitals is limited in India,&#13;
because of the unavailability of data. However, due to variations in the case-mix, it is difficult to&#13;
comparc cost-effectiveness comparisons between these categories of hospitals. Also, because more&#13;
serious and complicated cases are admitted at tertiary hospitals, the length of stay and treatment costs&#13;
tend to be higher at tertiary hospitals. Previous analysis has shown that between 2540% of costs could&#13;
be savcd by treating patients at first referral facilities rather than at tcrtiary hospitals. The data used in&#13;
such analysis have been much more broad-based and have tended to overlook somc of the problems&#13;
noted herc. Moreover, such analysis did not compare similar services.&#13;
4.     A preliminary analysis was undertaken during the preparation of the project and is the initial&#13;
part of a much broader study being undertaken as part of our sector work on "Comparative Analysis of&#13;
State Health Systems Reform in India." The analysis here estimates cost savings of treating patients at&#13;
a first referral hospital compared to a tertiary hospital in Hyderabad. The reason for choosing hospitals&#13;
in Hyderabad was because of the availability of accurate cost data and the comparability of the services&#13;
provided. These hospitals were the Suraj Bhan hospital, a first referral facility and the Sultan Bazaar&#13;
Matemity hospital, a tertiary hospital attached to the Osmania Medical College in Hyderabad. Both&#13;
hospitals provide antenatal, intranatal and Family Planning Services in addition to gynecological care.&#13;
The case-mix at the two hospitals is more or less similar- where a major chunk of the in-patient facility&#13;
is utilized by obstetric and family planning cases which constituted about 40% and 30% of in-patients,&#13;
respectively during the past 2 years in both the hospitals; about 11% of the in-patients were constituted&#13;
by patients' admitted for gynecological problems and procedures; and a roughly equal proportion of in-&#13;
patients had complicated obstetric care. One difference, however, was the higher utilization of out-&#13;
patients at Suraj Bhan (first referral) Hospital, with a much higher number of out-patients per in-patient&#13;
(6 to 1) compared to the Sultan Bazaar Matemity Hospital (1.2 to 1).&#13;
5.     Estimation of Costs. The recurrent costs for the Sultan Bazaar Hospital were taken from the&#13;
budget books, and the recurrent costs of the Suraj Bhan Hospital were taken from hospital records and&#13;
&#13;

grants received from the Government. The recurring expenditure under different heads for three&#13;
financial years for both the hospitals is presented in Tables 2 and 3. Since both hospitals come under&#13;
different administrative systems, cost heads do not exactly match, and information on some heads is not&#13;
being routinely compiled by these institutions. However, at an aggregate level both data sets represent&#13;
average recurning costs.&#13;

6.     Estimation of Capital Costs. Capital costs, however, were more difficult to estimate, as both&#13;
hospitals are located in old residential structures that were converted several decades ago. In addition,&#13;
the equipment is relatively old. Hence, it was not possible to arrive at precise capital costs. An&#13;
approach suggested by WHO for estimating capital costs' was used. This included a detailed listing of&#13;
existing capital resources of both hospitals, namely building (arca), equipment (major, minor and&#13;
surgical) and furniture. The current costs of these capital resources were applied to the existing&#13;
facilities of both hospitals. For each capital facility the mean duration of utility was arrived at by&#13;
obtaining expert opinion. Exarnples from the Indian context were taken to arrive at a capital facility&#13;
with a mean duration of use and the annual capital cost component.&#13;

6.Estimation of Unit Costs. Since the hospitals studied provide both in-patient and out-patient services,&#13;
a comprehensive index which captures both types of services was applied to arrive at a unit cost figure.&#13;
The day equivalent method which equates the cost of one in-patient day with four out-patient visits was&#13;
used. Using the case equivalent method, the unit cost for each hospital was calculated. The results are&#13;
shown in Table 4.&#13;

7.     As data on in-patients and out-patients were available only for two years (1993-94; 1994-95),&#13;
the analysis applies only to this period. The results indicate that day equivalent at the Suraj Bhan&#13;
secondary hospital is about two-thirds that of the Sultan Bazaar Maternity Hospital. The results are&#13;
similar to other studies which found that services at secondary level facilities can be provided more cost&#13;
effectively than at tertiary hospitals if it is technically possible to provide these services at the secondary&#13;
level. In other words, there can be considerable cost savings if services that can be provided at&#13;
secondary level facilities are provided at those facilities rather than at tertiary hospitals. The main&#13;
reason for this at the two hospitals studied was largely because of greater unit costs of infrastructure&#13;
and overheads at tertiary hospitals.&#13;
8.     A review of several studies undertaken by Barnum et. al. also concluded that within a country,&#13;
tertiary hospitals tend to have higher average costs than the less technically complex district level&#13;
hospitals. However, they did not analyze unit costs for similar types of services provided. These results&#13;
are merely indicative, and apply only for two hospitals. However, they do illustrate the fact that&#13;
streamlining and rationalization of services can result in considerable cost savings.&#13;

USER CHARGES AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
1.    The principle of implementing user charges more rigorously for both inpatient and&#13;
outpatient diagnostic and treatment services in hospitals has been adopted by the Governments of&#13;
Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal. The Governments regard cost recovery as a way of&#13;
augmenting public resources for healthcare, though not for substituting for them. Responsibility for&#13;
meeting the incremental recurrent costs of the project has been accepted by each Government.&#13;
Three-quarters of total health expenditures in India already are made directly by patients to private&#13;
doctors and hospitals. Studies show that the poor are disproportionately represented among the&#13;
users of public hospitals. Full cost recovery in the public sector is neither feasible nor desirable.&#13;
Equally, however, each government has adopted the principle that those patients who are able to&#13;
pay for services in public hospitals should do so to some degree and that revenues should be of a&#13;
size to have a significant effect on funding non-salary recurrent costs. Therefore, the system of&#13;
user fees proposed by each state is a combination of voluntary payments and targeting of the poor&#13;
for exemption.&#13;
2.    In summary, the guiding principles for implementing user charges will be to: (a) recover a&#13;
part of the costs of inpatient hospital services from those patients who can afford to pay, while&#13;
protecting the poorest sections of society; (b) charge all outpatients a nominal fee partly to&#13;
improve record-keeping and partly to raise moderately hospital income (Punjab and West Bengal);&#13;
(c) concentrate charges on voluntary services such as private rooms or wards and on medical&#13;
services with a relatively low cost-effectiveness; (d) enable hospitals to retain all or part of the&#13;
revenues collected by them (Punjab) or to empower district health committees (West Bengal and&#13;
Karnataka) to retain the revenues and redistribute them amnong hospitals within the district&#13;
according to both need and level of collection; (e) ensure that revenues are used for non-salary&#13;
recurrent items. In the absence of quality improvements, new or increased charges could lead to&#13;
reduced demand for hospital services with an overall reduction in revenues. Increased charges will,&#13;
thereforc, be introduced in a phased manner and matched to higher qualhcy levels of services. Somc&#13;
would be appropriate immediately. Others would need to await improvement in services and&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
3.     While the general principles are common across the three states, there are variations in the&#13;
way they will be implemented. The programs of each state are described below, followed by an&#13;
indicative example of the levels of revenue which might accrue.&#13;
Karnataka&#13;
4.     Outpatient charges. Currently no charges are made for outpatients. A recommendation is&#13;
before the Govemrnent to implement an annual Rs. 2 registration fee. The intention is both to&#13;
encourage patients to keep a record of their treatment and to raise revenues. Charges of Rs. 5 are&#13;
currently made for issuing health certificates. Half the revenue is retained by the doctor and half&#13;
retained by the government. Such charges represented 40 percent (Rs. 41 million ) of total revenues&#13;
collected by the Department of Health and Family Welfare during 1992-93.&#13;
5.    Inpatient charges. The last revision of charges was made in 1988. Patients who are a&#13;
mernber of a family with an annual income of above Rs. 8,000 a year arc meant to be charged Rs.&#13;
2 per day for a bed in a general ward. Daily charges for four, two and single bedded rooms are Rs.&#13;
5, Rs 7.5 and Rs. 15 respectively. Of total hospital beds, paying beds currently constitute only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86                                  Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
around 4 percent (600 out of 17,500). Fees for medical services are also listed and they are also&#13;
graded. Patients in special wards are meant to pay full fees while those in paying general wards&#13;
should pay 50 percent of the fee. Patients in general wards pay no fees. Average annual revenues&#13;
from all charges over the period 1990-93 were Rs. 66 million -- equivalent to under 2 percent of&#13;
total DOHFW expenditure. If all the charges were in practice being levied, revenues would be&#13;
greater than those actually collected. Recommendations are before the Government to introduce a&#13;
small registration fee (with no exemption), to revise the charges for paying beds and to increase&#13;
their number through the designation of 20 percent of all additional beds. Revisions of charges for&#13;
treatment will be undertaken during the project but the immediate priority is to increase the&#13;
collection of existing charges.&#13;
6.     Exemption for the Poor. A criterion for exempting the poor has been proposed by the&#13;
Government. The Government proposes to use the existing green/tricolor card system within the&#13;
Public Distribution System (PDS) in the state, which is used to provide nutritional support through&#13;
issue of subsidized grain, as a basis for exemption from user fees. Green card holders are also&#13;
entitled to subsidized cloth and kerosene. All poor families with an annual income level of Rs.&#13;
11,850 or below (i.e., the nationally accepted norm under the JRY program) are entitled to such&#13;
green cards. Comprehensive surveys of the rural population were undertaken in the past for&#13;
identifying the beneficiaries. As of now, the rural population with an annual income of Rs. 1 1,850&#13;
or below has been provided with green cards. This includes special categories of underprivileged&#13;
populations like landless agricultural laborers, village artisans, small and marginal farmers, old-&#13;
age pensioners, widow pensioners as well as the urban poor. The green card facility has recently&#13;
been extended to the non-notified slums. The number of green card holders in the state are about&#13;
5.3 million compared to the 9 million ration card holders of the PDS system. The Government has&#13;
provided assurances that it will carefully monitor the green card system as a basis for exemption&#13;
from user fees and ensure that leakages are minimized.&#13;
7.     Revenue administration. The main reason why charges are under collected at hospitals is&#13;
that the revenues currently revert to thc Government treasury, where they become part of general&#13;
revenues. There is no direct incentive for collection. The Government is taking necessary action to&#13;
ensure that the receipts will be fully transferred to District Health Committees and be reallocated&#13;
between hospitals in the district on the basis of both need and level of revenue collection.&#13;
Punjab&#13;
8.     Outpatient charges. Currently, a charge of Rs. 2 is made for outpatients. A Government&#13;
Order giving notification of (among other things) Rs. 5 registration fee was prepared in early&#13;
1994, but is still pending. The Government provided assurances that it would implement the&#13;
enhanced outpatient charges as quality improvements are effected through the project. In addition,&#13;
it has proposed to establish 'pay clinics' in government hospitals to be operated after regular&#13;
hospital hours by government doctors. Of the fees, 50 percent would be retained by the doctor and&#13;
50 percent retained by the institution.&#13;
9.     Inpatient charges. The Government Order also established sets of fees for inservice&#13;
medical facilities. These included charges for special wards in district and sub-divisional hospitals,&#13;
daily visiting charges by doctors and for laboratory investigations such as X-ray, diathermy, ECG,&#13;
CT scan and ultra sound and for various categories of,urgery. The proposed charges are higher&#13;
than those proposed in the other two states and the coverage of treatrnents wider.&#13;
&#13;

10.    Exemption for the Poor. Exemptions to the charges noted above include state govemment&#13;
employees and members of families holding yellow cards which signify a family income of below&#13;
Rs. 11,850 based on the JRY norms. New lists of families eligible for these cards have begun and&#13;
will have been completed by negotiations. Total revenue raised by DOHFW in 1993/94 was Rs. 25&#13;
million or just over I percent of expenditure. According to the National Sample Survey 1987/88,&#13;
almost 50 percent of hospitalized cases are in non public hospitals. The average payment per case&#13;
in these institutions was Rs. 1,200, indicating a willingness to pay arnong the general population.&#13;
Because of the higher income level in Punjab, the ability and willingness to pay for services is&#13;
greater than in the other two states. As a result, there exists considerable opportunity to increase&#13;
revenue collection through increased charges and better collection methods.&#13;
11.    Revenue administration. The Government has determined that revenues will be retained by&#13;
the institution of collection for the purpose of non-salary recurrent expenditures.&#13;
West Bengal&#13;
12.    Outpatient charnes. A structure of hospital charges was implemented with effect from&#13;
November 1992. Among the changes implemented was an outpatient charge of Rs. I per&#13;
prescription slip, an OPD ticket which is used on average 3 times, for teaching and district&#13;
hospitals. In 1995, a Governnent Order was issued to cover all subdivisional hospitals in the&#13;
Calcutta Municipal Corporation and all polyclinics in Calcutta. There are no exemptions for these&#13;
OPD charges. Charges for most tests and diagnoses exist -- in the range of Rs. 10 to Rs. 50 - but&#13;
few are collected. A review body is currently considering some new charges. The Government&#13;
provided assurances that extension of charges to state general hospitals will be considered upon&#13;
improvement of services under the project.&#13;
13.   InDatient charges. The review of 1992 also resulted in an upward revision of charges for&#13;
private beds, diagnostic services and surgery in district and sub-divisional hospitals. Fees are&#13;
charged for 10 percent of beds (mostly in special wards). As a result of sevcral perceived&#13;
anomalies in the structure of fees, these were again revised and extended in early 1995. Paying bed&#13;
charges in general wards are Rs. 10 a day in most tertiary teaching hospitals and Rs. 6 in state,&#13;
district and sub-divisional hospitals. Separate room charges are Rs. 30 and Rs. 16 respectively.&#13;
Charges are made for diagnoses and for surgery for those in private beds and wards. The majority&#13;
of charges are below Rs. 50 apart from those for endoscopy and CT scan. More recently, another&#13;
review has been initiated which, in addition to surveying the levels of charges, is attempting to&#13;
rationalize them across both the secondary and tertiary sectors. Regarding paying beds, the&#13;
Government proposes to enhance these to 30 percent of all beds at district, state general and sub-&#13;
divisional hospitals. A further extension to rural hospitals will also be considered. Another avenue&#13;
of user charges are the polyclinics in urban centers manned largely by doctors of teaching&#13;
hospitals. These provide mainly outpatient services and charge Rs. 16-20 per visit. In 1994/95, the&#13;
largest of the polyclinics generated almost 15 percent of recurrent costs with a similar amount&#13;
being paid to the doctors. Revenues generated by all.charges are currently equal to just under 3&#13;
percent of total DOHFW expenditure.&#13;
14.    Exemptions for the Poor. The existing system for exempting the poor in West Bengal is&#13;
based on an 'Indigent Certificate' from the local elected reprcsentative, given to families with an&#13;
income level below Rs. 1,500 per month. The West Bengal Government proposcs to use this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88                                Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
criterion rather than the JRY criterion because the latter does not apply to large portions of the&#13;
urban population of West Bengal.&#13;
15.    Revenue administration. Provisions exist for the Government, through the Finance&#13;
Department, to reallocate 50 percent of the incremental funds collected through user charges to the&#13;
collecting institution. The procedures, however, are said to be very tortuous and are rarely used.&#13;
The Government has provided assurances that it will take necessary actions to ensure that revenues&#13;
collected through user charges at the district, state general, sub-divisional and rural hospitals will&#13;
be retained at the district level to be reallocated amongst hospitals in the district based on both need&#13;
and level of revenue collection.&#13;
Potential Revenues From User Charges&#13;
16.   In each of the three states, review bodies to consider the structure and implementation of&#13;
user fees in hospitals exist and proposals are being actively considered. Here, an indicative&#13;
example is developed of the potential revenue that would be generated through the implementation&#13;
of the types of user charges now being discussed and implemented. Sets of alternative assumptions&#13;
are used. The example is based on information for Karnataka.&#13;
17.    Paving beds and wards. Currently, total bed strength is 14,858 at secondary hospitals. Of&#13;
these there are around 400 paying beds in the district hospitals and 200 in the tertiary, teaching,&#13;
hospitals. The project will add 3,832 additional beds. Another 1,400 beds will be added through a&#13;
planned KFW project. Of the additional beds it is proposed that 20 percent will be paying beds. In&#13;
secondary level institutions, the total number of paying beds will incrcasc from around 400 to&#13;
almost 1450.  As was described above, there are different bed charges depending on the number&#13;
of beds per room. Currently, the average charge is Rs. 6 per day. It is intended to increase the&#13;
charges considerably. Assuming that charges for 2 and I bedded rooms average Rs. 50 per day and&#13;
for 4 and 6 bedded rooms, Rs. 20 per day, that onc quarter of the beds fall under the first category&#13;
and two thirds under the latter and that occupancy rates remain at around the current level of 85&#13;
percent, the increase in revenuc would be:&#13;
Table I: Project Revenue from Paying Beds and Wards&#13;
Current:     400 beds       x      310 days     x         Rs. 6 =  Rs. 0.7 m.&#13;
Future:      362 beds       x      310 days     x         Rs. 50 =  Rs. 5.6 m.&#13;
1088 beds      x      310 days      x        Rs. 2u =  Rs. 6.7 m.&#13;
Total    Rs. 12.3 m.&#13;
Increase: Rs. 11.6 m.&#13;
18.    Charges for Diagnostic Services and Surgery. A proposal is currently being considered by&#13;
the Government to charge a registration fee (Rs. 5) for each in-servicc case. The most recent&#13;
estimate, for 1992, is of 900,000 cases a year. The fee (if applied with no exemptions) would raise&#13;
Rs. 4.5 million. Thc charges being discussed for diagnostic scrvices and surgery in Karnataka tend&#13;
to vary according to whether the patient is in a special ward or the gencral ward. It is proposed that&#13;
one set of charges would apply to all those in paying beds while those in general wards (but with&#13;
an income of over Rs. 11,850 a year) would pay half that rate. Obviously, in setting charges for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89                                    Annex 5&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
patients in special wards care will need to be taken to ensure that the combined higher quality of&#13;
room and services can justify the additional charge. Otherwise, patients will either opt for the&#13;
general wards or for private sector treatment and the paying beds will be underutilized. Currently,&#13;
while there is a schedule of charges, last revised in 1988, few are collected owing to the lack of&#13;
institutional incentive previously described. The charges in Kamataka, similar to those being&#13;
proposed in West Bengal, suggest a level of Rs. 45 for minor surgery and Rs. 100 for major&#13;
surgery. Charges for some forms of diagnosis are higher but apart from scans etc. few are above&#13;
Rs. 300.&#13;
19.    The total number of inpatient cases in Karnataka is estimated to be 900,000 a year. Those&#13;
inpatients below the defined poverty line and therefore to be exempted from charges are estimated&#13;
at 30 percent -- 270,000 patient cases. Of the remaining 600,000 or so cases, six percent or 36,000&#13;
will be in paying beds. The remaining 564,000 would be in general wards. Assuming that one-&#13;
quarter of patients require major surgery and the rest require minor surgery, the annual revenue&#13;
from the charges would be:&#13;
Table 2: Projected Revenue from Major and Minor Surgery&#13;
Patients           Major Surgery           Minor Surgery            Revenue&#13;
36,000 in paybeds    9,000 x  Rs. 100 +     27,000 x Rs. 45 =    Rs.   1.3 m.&#13;
564,000 in general   141,000 x  Rs. 50 +    423,000 x Rs. 23 =    Rs.  17.0 m. wards&#13;
l _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Total   Rs.   18.3   m .&#13;
Ovcrall, increased revenues from inpatients might be around Rs. 11.6 million for bed charges, Rs.&#13;
4.5 million for registration fees and Rs. 18.3 million for diagnostic scrvices and surgery: a total of&#13;
Rs. 34.5 million.&#13;
20.    Outpatient charges. A recommcndation to charge a registration fee (covering a year or&#13;
until the registration card is filled up) of Rs. 2 for outpatients without exemptions is being&#13;
considered by Government. In 1992, roughly 10 million cases were registcred. Revenue would be&#13;
Rs. 20 million.&#13;
21.    Other charges. Forty percent of departmental revenues are currently generated through&#13;
charges for health certificates. The charge is Rs. 5. A proposal to double the charge is being&#13;
considered. This would increase revenues from this source from Rs. 41 million to Rs. 82 million a&#13;
year.&#13;
Summary&#13;
22.    Annual recurrent expenditures for secondary health services are expected to be Rs. 1,560&#13;
million at the end of the project period. The mcasures described above could gencrate around Rs.&#13;
136 million, equivalent to almost 9 percent of the total or over 29 percent of all non-salary&#13;
recurrent expenditures. This amount of additional rcsources could have a significant effect on the&#13;
levels of scrvice quality provided by secondary health care institutions. In these computations, the&#13;
existing charges for treatment have been utilized. Revenues generated from these would provide&#13;
only one quarter of all revenues and are much less than those arising from increased charges for&#13;
certificates etc. The charges of Rs. 45 and Rs. 100 for minor and major surgery respectively might&#13;
be compared to the average private expenditure on an episode of hospitalization in a rural private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

hospital in 1986/87 of Rs. 733 (NSSO). The estimated revenues from user charges, therefore,&#13;
should be regarded as being at the low end of the potential range. There remains considerable&#13;
opportunity to review and enhance charges for minor and major surgery, while making sure that&#13;
appropriate mechanisms for protecting the poor are in place.&#13;
23.    These calculations are mainly illustrative. While the decisions have been made in each&#13;
state both to increase the role of user charges and improve the system of implementation,&#13;
Governments have yet to implement all aspects of the levels and coverage of charges that would&#13;
yield this level of revenue. The results, however, do indicate the potential which exists to augment&#13;
government resources for health services through a few relatively simple measures. The immediate&#13;
priority is to implement the existing patterns of charges more effectively and to monitor the use and&#13;
effects of the revenues on health services.&#13;

PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
1.    Project management arrangements in the three states have several commnon elements and some&#13;
differences. In Karnataka and West Bengal, the project will be managed and implemented by the Department&#13;
of Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW) which will be strengthened under the project to address increased&#13;
investment at the primary and secondary levels of health care. In Puniab, the project will be managed and&#13;
implemented by the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC), which was established as an Act and&#13;
promulgated as an Ordinance on October 20, 1995. The aim of the Corporation is to establish, expand,&#13;
improve and administer medical care at the secondary or first referral level in Punjab. Chart I of this Annex&#13;
shows the functional levels of project management that apply across all three states.&#13;
2.     The project management arrangements proposed in each state have taken account of the existing&#13;
organizational set-up of the Health and Family Welfare Department, the health programs being currently&#13;
implemented by the Department and the overall set-up of public administration in the state, especially with&#13;
regard to the nature of decentralized administration in each state. The management structure proposed in each&#13;
state would assist in implementing a health system both efficiently and effectively. This Annex describes in&#13;
detail the project management arrangements to implement the project in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal.&#13;
Karnataka&#13;
3.     A Proiect Goveming Boar (PGB), at the top of the management structure, includes high-level&#13;
representation from all relevant parts of the state Govemment that would be associated with the project. The&#13;
PGB is fully empowered to make major policy decisions and develop the broad policy outlines for the project&#13;
in Karnataka; approve the annual budget; authorize major project revisions as necessary; ratify decisions made&#13;
by the Steering Committee; formulate rules and regulations; and undertake an annual review of project&#13;
implementation and monitor overall project progress. The PGB would meet twice a year.&#13;
4.     The PGB would delegate adequate powers to the Steering Committee to carry out its functions as the&#13;
nodal body for project implementation. The Secretary, DOHFW, would be the Chairman of the Steering&#13;
Committee and the Project Coordinator.  The Steering Committee will supervise and monitor project&#13;
implementation, undertake planning activities and facilitate project management activities. It will report to the&#13;
PGB (Chart 2).&#13;
5.     The Proiect Management Cell would be headed by an Additional Secretary, [AS cadre, who would&#13;
serve as the Project Administrator. This officer would report directly to the Secretary, DOHFW. An&#13;
Additional Director (Health Systems, World Bank) would assist the Coordinator and Administrator in day-to-&#13;
day operations.  Under the Additional Director, a Technical Wing would assist in carrying out project&#13;
implementation. A Joint Director (Hospitals), who would be a Senior Medical Officer, and who has&#13;
considerable field experience of working in hospitals of all levels, would be in charge of the medical and&#13;
technical aspects of the project. This official would be supported by four Deputy Directors: Deputy Director&#13;
(Training and Referral); Deputy Director (Hospitals North); Deputy Director (Hospitals South); and Deputy&#13;
Director (HMIS). They will maintain the project profiles in respect of all 202 institutions being taken up&#13;
under the project, prepare Action Plans for each institution and be responsible for the continuous&#13;
implementation and monitoring of progress for each component of the project. Thc position of an Additional&#13;
Director for the Gulbarga region would be created to implement the KfW project and will be financed by the&#13;
KfW project. This officer will report to the Project Administrator to foster collaboration between the World&#13;
Bank and KfW projects and facilitate the functioning of the overall health system.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 20&#13;
6.     A Desiggn and Engineering Wing in DOHFW, headed by a Chief Engineer, would be responsible for&#13;
designing, supervising and monitoring all the facilities to be renovated/extended under the project. The budget&#13;
for civil works will be directly released by the project management to this wing, which would be fully&#13;
accountable to the project authorities. Administratively, this wing will function as part of project staff. The&#13;
Chief Engineer would be supported by two Superintending Engineers, and an adequate complement of&#13;
Executive Engineers, Assistant Executive Engineers and Junior Engineers in the various districts. The&#13;
Superintending Engineer of World Bank supported IPP-IX will also report to the Chief Engineer. A Senior&#13;
Architect, specialized in hospital design, would be responsible for reviewing hospital design. He would report&#13;
to the Additional Director (Health Systems Project) for administrative purposes and to the Chief Architect of&#13;
the state for all technical issues. Equipment Management arrangements incorporated in the project are&#13;
described in Annex 10.&#13;
7.     A Strategic Planning Cell (SPC) headed by an Additional Director (Planning), would report directly to&#13;
the Secretary, DOHFW. The SPC would monitor the critical issues in the health sector in the state by&#13;
commissioning studies, workshops and seminars, and by directly hiring consultants to facilitate these activities.&#13;
These issues would include monitoring the development of the private health sector; reviewing suitability of&#13;
present regulations regarding the quality of private care provision; analyzing the evolving epidemiological&#13;
profile in the states; evaluating the burden of disease and cost-effectiveness of public health interventions;&#13;
reviewing medical manpower and reviewing the implementation of cost-recovery mechanisms and sectoral&#13;
resource allocation patterns.&#13;
8.     At the district level, a District Health Committee/Proiect Implementation Cell would facilitate&#13;
functioning of the referral system, the collection and redistribution of user charges, maintenance of equipment,&#13;
waste management, training of technical staff, quality assurance, surveillance of communicable diseases, and&#13;
the monitoring and supervision of all project activities (Chart 3). It would ensure that user charges would be&#13;
implemented more rigorously at all hospitals. A post of Resident Medical Officer (RMO) for each district&#13;
hospital has been created. The RMO will take over the managcment of the district hospital, thereby enabling&#13;
the District Surgeon to take on an expanded set of responsibilities, including monitoring the functioning of the&#13;
referral system; planning and implementing the training component at the district level; supervising all&#13;
hospitals outside the purview of the Zilla Parishad; and managing and supervising the equipment maintenance&#13;
facility at the district level. The counterpart of the District Surgeon for non-hospital health and family welfare&#13;
services at the district level is the District Health Officer, who will continue to implement all state and national&#13;
health and family welfare programs. The District Surgeon would be supported by a social worker, mass media&#13;
officer, junior engineer and an assistant controller of finance and accounts in implementing the project at the&#13;
district level.&#13;
Punjab&#13;
9.     At the top of the management structure of the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC) would be&#13;
the Board of Directors. whose ex-officio Chairman would be the Secretary, DOHFW (Chart 4). The Board of&#13;
Directors would consist of 13 members: 7 ex-officio members, including the Secretary, DOHFW; Special&#13;
Secretary and Managing Director of PHSC; Secretary, Finance; Sccretary, Rural Development and&#13;
Panchayats; Secretary, Local Government; Director, Health Services; a Representative from the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare, GOI; and 6 nominated members. The Board of Directors would have powers to&#13;
formulate policies for the Corporation, make regulations, borrow money and levy fee for services, and would&#13;
be responsible for overseeing the overall management of the Corporation. The Government of Punjab would&#13;
have the powers to issue directions to the Corporation in matters of policy, inspection and control, monitoring,&#13;
and accounting.&#13;

Page 3 of 20&#13;
10.    The Proiect Management Cell would be headed by Special Secretary, IAS Cadre, who would be the&#13;
Managing Director of the Corporation. The Project Management Cell would undertake all aspects of project&#13;
implementation, including routine management, monitor progress, maintain flow of funds and project accounts,&#13;
provide general administration and technical guidance and prepare progress reports. The Managing Director&#13;
would be assisted by an Additional Managing Director and five other Functional Directors: Administration and&#13;
Personnel; Medical Management, Medical Services, Engineering Services, M &amp; E and HMIS and Financial&#13;
Management. The Additional Managing Director would be responsible for Administration and Personnel and&#13;
would be supported by a Manager for personnel matters relating to doctors, two Assistant Managers and four&#13;
Assistants. He will also be responsible for purchase of non-medical equipment, stationary and other office&#13;
equipment and will be supported by an accountant and an assistant in the performance of these functions.&#13;
Another Assistant would also support him on matters relating to purchase and maintenance of vehicles.&#13;
11.    The Director for Medical Management would be supported by four Joint Directors - one for referral,&#13;
quality assurance and medical audits, one for ensuring linkages with national programs, one for waste&#13;
management and surveillance of communicable diseases and one for purchase and distribution of drugs and&#13;
medical supplies. These Joint Directors would be supported in the performance of their functions by the&#13;
necessary Deputy and Assistant Directors. The Director for Medical Services would be supported by a&#13;
Manager, personnel (nurses and paramedics), a Joint Director for training, and a Joint Director for the&#13;
purchase of drugs and medical supplies. The Manager and three Joint Directors would be supported by a&#13;
number of Deputy and Assistant Directors for performing specific functions. The Director for M&amp;E would be&#13;
supported by a Deputy Director for IEC and a Deputy Director for M&amp;E and performance indicators. The&#13;
latter would be supported by two Research Officers/Statisticians.&#13;
12.    The Director for Engineering Services would be responsible for both civil works as well as equipment&#13;
management and maintenance matters. He would be supported by a Superintending Engineer (whose level&#13;
would be that of a PWD, Building and Roads Superintending Engineer) and three Executive Engineers under&#13;
him. The three Executive Engineers would be responsible for public health (water supply, sanitation, pipes&#13;
and fitting, sewerage, anesthetic and oxygen systems), electrical matters (wiring, equipment, etc.), civil works&#13;
and building maintenance. Each of the Executive Engineers would be supported by two Subdivisional&#13;
Engineers. For civil works and building maintenance, two additional Junior Engineers and an Accountant&#13;
would also be recruited.&#13;
13.    The Director for Financial Management would be responsible for revenue, audits and accounts. He&#13;
would be supported by two Deputy Managers, one for Audit and one for Accounts/Revenues. The Deputy&#13;
Manager for Audit will be assisted by two Assistant Managers, one for Pre-Audit and one for Post-Purchase,&#13;
and by four Auditors. The Deputy Manager for Accounts/Revenues would be responsible for banking,&#13;
ledgers, user charges, flow of funds and salaries. He would be assisted by two Accountants and one Assistant.&#13;
14.    A Stratezic Planning Cell (SPC) would report to the Secretary, DOHFW  through the Managing&#13;
Director, PHSC. The SPC would monitor the critical issues in the health sector in the state by commissioning&#13;
studies, workshops and seminars, and by directly hiring consultants to facilitate these activities. These issues&#13;
would include monitoring the development of the private health sector; reviewing suitability of present&#13;
regulations regarding the quality of private care provision; analyzing the evolving epidemiological profile in&#13;
the states; evaluating the burden of disease and cost-effectiveness of public health interventions; reviewing&#13;
medical manpower and reviewing the implementation of cost-recovery mechanisms and sectoral resource&#13;
allocation patterns.&#13;
15.    At the district level, a District Health Committee/Proiect Implementation Cell (chart 5) would be the&#13;
nodal implementing agency. It would facilitate functioning of the referral system, ensure maintenance of&#13;

equipment, manage hospital waste, train technical staff, provide quality assurance, undertake surveillance of&#13;
communicable diseases, monitor and supervise project activities, and collect and redistribute user charges at&#13;
the district level. The Civil Surgeon would be the Deputy Medical Commissioner and Chairman. The&#13;
Committee would be composed of the District Development and Panchayat Officer; District Horticulture&#13;
Officer; Executive Engineer, Municipal Corporation; Senior Medical Officer; and Municipal Health Officer as&#13;
official members, and two members from the hospital welfare committee as non-official members. The Deputy&#13;
Medical Commissioner would be assisted by an Assistant Medical Commissioner and by a Medical&#13;

TRAINING&#13;
1.     The primary objective of the training component is to improve quality and strengthen the&#13;
services provided at first referral facilities. The strengthening of services at these hospitals is expected&#13;
to improve the referral system, provide better quality of services, and reduce the burden on tertiary&#13;
hospitals in the cities. Each state would implement a comprehensive training program for upgrading&#13;
skills at rural, sub-divisional and district hospitals.&#13;
2.     During project preparation, the DOHFW in each state set up a working group responsible for&#13;
matters related to training and skill development. The working groups are composed of experienced&#13;
clinicians from rural and teaching hospitals as well as nursing personnel, hospital superintendents and&#13;
administrators. These working groups conducted a rapid training needs assessment study, where&#13;
teams from the working groups visited a number of secondary hospitals and interacted with the medical&#13;
and paramedical staff of these hospitals. Each state then conducted a training workshop to discuss the&#13;
results of the rapid training needs assessment study and developed priority intervention strategies.&#13;
3.     The working groups' concluded that training programs are necessary for all categories of&#13;
hospital manpower, including doctors, specialists, nurses and technicians at all levels. It was decided&#13;
that the program should include training of clinical skills, hospital management, use and maintenance of&#13;
equipment, hospital record-keeping and reporting, and the functioning of referral system. In addition,&#13;
the teams identified other types of training where participants would include not only hospital staff, but&#13;
other state and district level officers. These participants would receive training on IEC, health&#13;
management information system (HMIS) and on surveillance of major communicable diseases.&#13;
Additional information on specific training programs are provided in the individual annexes.&#13;
4.     The working groups considered several factors while formulating a comprehensive training&#13;
program: (a) the target group to receive training; (b) the issues/subjects that need to be addressed;&#13;
(c) the number of staff in each category to be trained; (d) the training of traincrs; (e) the availability of&#13;
cxisting training materials versus the need to develop new curriculum and training modules; (f) the&#13;
number of trainees each year; and (g) the unit cost of training.&#13;
Clinical Training&#13;
5.     Concept. In order to improve the quality and effectiveness of clinical services in hospitals, the&#13;
states would establish periodic in-service clinical training for health professionals. The goal of clinical&#13;
training would be to upgrade skills of health professionals, in order to provide safe and high quality&#13;
services to clients. Norms for these services were defined for each type of hospital through workshops held&#13;
in each state.&#13;
6.     Clinical training deals primarily with obtaining the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to&#13;
carry out a specific procedure or activity. Although this training can be thought of as being effective if&#13;
it succeeds in conveying information or influencing attitudes, it will have failed if the participants are&#13;
unable to satisfactorily perform the activity assigned to them. Clinical training would therefore focus on&#13;
providing the essential facts and attitudes, as well as developing skills required for performing a specific&#13;
procedure or activity.&#13;
7.     The training provided would be competency-based training (CBT) or learning by doing. It is&#13;
based on a social learning theory which states that when conditions are ideal, a person learns most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112                                    Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
rapidly and effectively by watching someone (in this case the trainer) perform a skill. The participant&#13;
later performs the skill under the guidance and facilitation of the trainer. To successfully accomplish&#13;
CBT, the skill or activity to be taught must be broken down into essential steps. Each step is then&#13;
analyzed to determine the most efficient and safe way to both teach and learn it. This process is called&#13;
standardization. Once a procedure has been standardized, competency-based learning guides and&#13;
checklists could be developed to facilitate learning the necessary steps and provide more objective&#13;
evaluation of the participant's performance.&#13;
8.     Training Approach. This project would undertake the CBT approach to clinical training which&#13;
is based on demonstration, practice, feedback and assessment of the minimum level of competence in&#13;
performing a job. A combination of three modalities would be used for providing in-service training:&#13;
short courses, practical training and distance learning packages. In order to do so, responsible working&#13;
groups in each state would develop curricula suitable for each type of training. These working groups&#13;
would also design and conduct the training of trainers and develop necessary training modules.&#13;
9.     Who Will be Trained?  A preliminary analysis of the categories of staff and training needs&#13;
indicates that two distinct categories of training will be provided: (a) updating the knowledge and skills&#13;
within specialty areas for those who have already had post-graduate training; and (b) updating the&#13;
knowledge and skills for those who have not received post-graduate training in the identified areas&#13;
(MBBS, nurses, lab technicians, radiographer).&#13;
10.    Curriculum Development. Since clinical training will focus on hands-on practice to improve&#13;
skills in performing procedures, a specific curriculum needs to be developed accordingly. With the&#13;
assistance of a consultant on clinical training, each state is expected to establish several working groups&#13;
and conduct workshops to develop suitable curricula for different types of training categories&#13;
(physicians, specialists and nurses). The members of the working groups would consist of experienced&#13;
clinicians who are competent in their specialties, physicians who have experience working in rural&#13;
hospitals and some members from medical colleges. Curricula would be continued to be developed&#13;
during the early implementation phase of the project.&#13;
11.    TraininR Modules. The modules for clinical training would be very specific, including learning&#13;
objectives and methods, and check lists to evaluate skills. Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal will first&#13;
review existing training materials developed by APVVP in Andra Pradesh, USAID-JHPIEGO and&#13;
WHO, and adapt training materials accordingly. If necessary, the states will assign working groups to&#13;
develop the specific training modules.&#13;
12.    Training Site. To train physicians from the commnunity, rural, sub-district and sub-divisional&#13;
hospitals, the states would assign some district hospitals within the states as training centers. Some of&#13;
the advantages of such an arrangement would be: (a) conditions at district hospitals are more likely to&#13;
be similar than at teaching hospitals; (b) training rural hospital physicians at district hospitals is likely&#13;
to familiarize them with the functioning of the district hospital, thus facilitating the referral process.&#13;
Suitable district hospitals have been identified. The project will support construction of training&#13;
facilities at district hospitals, which consist of classrooms, libraries and training equipment.&#13;
13.    For training of specialists from district hospitals, the states have assigned several teaching and&#13;
tertiary hospitals as training centers. Further coordination With the staff of medical colleges will be&#13;
conducted during the first year of the project.&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 14&#13;
14.    Training of Trainers. Trainers who will provide clinical training in each state need to be kept&#13;
abreast of training technology and familiarized with the specific curriculum and training modules.&#13;
Training technology that they would have to acquire include: selection and use of appropriate teaching&#13;
methods for development of psychomotor skills (i.e. patient management procedures); small group teaching&#13;
methods; acquisition of desirable attitudes; and methods of assessment for evaluation of learning outcomes.&#13;
For this purpose, the state would organize appropriate short courses for staff of district hospitals and medical&#13;
colleges who will be serving as trainers in the training programs. Input for such training of trainers will be&#13;
obtained from institutions such as the National Teacher Training Centers for Medical Education and Research&#13;
(e.g. JIPMER in Pondicherry, PGIER in Chandigarh, etc.). Funds for such consultant support will be&#13;
available under the project.&#13;
15.    Distance Learning Packages (DLP). In addition to the regular training mentioned above, the&#13;
states would use DLP to improve clinical skills in various areas of specialties. DLPs are training&#13;
materials designed to be used by physicians and other health professionals to update their s"ills through&#13;
independent study. DLPs will help states to update physicians' skills on a regular basis, in a cost-&#13;
effective way. Since there is no experience in the use of DLPs, a pilot test will be conducted in a small&#13;
area. For development of the DLP, selected training institutions will be given contracts to develop or&#13;
adapt DLP appropriate to the training needs.&#13;
16.    Fellowships. The project will provide several fellowships for trainers to improve their teaching&#13;
skills, for managers and physicians to attend several short courses outside the country.&#13;
17.    Phasing of Training Program. The training program will be implemented in a phased manner&#13;
through the life of the project. The phasing is required both for the benefit of carefully planned training,&#13;
as well as for avoiding service distortion which could result from many doctors being away at training&#13;
at the same time. The total cost of the training program is therefore phased out over the five years of the&#13;
project (see Annex 21).&#13;
Clinical Training: Features Specific to Each State&#13;
16.    Karnataka. At government hospitals, the major cause of death of inpatients (compared to total&#13;
patients admitted) were as follow: perinatal complications (12.4 %/6), circulatory system disorders (9.1&#13;
%), ill-defined conditions (7.3 %), congenital anomalies (7.0%) and injury and poisoning (4.0%/6). The&#13;
working group has focused on improving the clinical skills of the hospital staff in these particular areas&#13;
while taking into consideration the results of the Workshop on Norms.&#13;
17.    A priority list of clinical skills for physicians and nurses of conmmunity hospitals, sub-district&#13;
hospitals and districts hospitals were identified and grouped by area of specialty. A plan outlining an&#13;
approach to updating these skills was completed in order to facilitate the preparation of training&#13;
manuals. The first priority is in the areas of obstetrics, neonatalogy, internal medicine, surgery and&#13;
anesthetics. Training for physicians of community hospital and sub-district (Taluka) hospitals will be&#13;
conducted at district hospitals. A teaching center, attached to each district hospital, will be constructed&#13;
and completed with teaching aids. Training of the specialists will be done at the teaching hospitals. The&#13;
clinical training for other areas of specialties will follow after the first priorities have been settled.&#13;
Table I describes the training programs for physicians and various specialties while Table 2 describes&#13;
those for nurses.&#13;
20.    Punjab. A transition in the burden of disease is currently underway in Punjab. Data from&#13;
several medical institutions (1993) showed that 76.5 % of out-patients and 85.7% of in-patients suffered&#13;

from non-communicable diseases. Acute respiratory infections were the next frequent reported cases,&#13;
when both out-patients and in-patients were taken into consideration. The Survey of Causes of Deaths&#13;
in rural areas (1991) showed that apart from "fever" (24 %) which reflects infected conditions, the&#13;
other leading cause of rural deaths were circulatory system disorders (17.2 %), degenerative conditions&#13;
(17%), trauma (11.3%) and respiratory disorders (11%). The working group focused on improving&#13;
clinical skills of the hospital staff in these particular areas while taking into consideration the result of&#13;
the Workshop on Norms.&#13;
21.    The Punjab Health Systems Corporation would give contracts to selected teaching institutions&#13;
within the state (medical colleges and nursing colleges) to assist the district hospitals in implementing&#13;
their training prograrn. Under this contract, the teaching institutions will assist the district hospitals in&#13;
conducting short on-site courses and practical clinical training. Fourteen teaching centers will be&#13;
constructed and they will be attached to fourteen district hospitals. These facilities will consist of&#13;
classrooms and library and teaching equipment. The total number of staff to be trained is about 10,000&#13;
including specialists, physicians, dentists, nurses and technicians.&#13;
22.    During the early stages of the project, short on-site courses and some practical clinical training&#13;
will be provided at the medical colleges or nursing colleges. The trainees wvill later be posted at the&#13;
district hospitals to obtain hands-on practical experience under close supervision of college professors.&#13;
After the project's initial two years, the on-site courses and practical clinical training will shift entirely&#13;
to the district hospitals. Throughout the training period selected staff from the teaching institutions will&#13;
be posted at district hospitals.&#13;
18.    West Benzal. The major cause of death at health institutions, as obtained from the Survey of&#13;
Causes of Death, 1987 (Model Registration Scheme), were complications of pregnancy and child birth&#13;
(22.7 %/6), infection and parasitic diseases (17.6%), ill-defined conditions (13.2 %), diseases of the&#13;
digestive system (10%) and injury and poisoning (8.7%). The working groups at the state level have&#13;
focused on improving the clinical skills of the hospital physicians, specialists and nurses in their&#13;
particular areas, in order to improve their clinical performance and quality of care.&#13;
24.    However, a survey on the causes of deaths carried out in the Howrah Municipal Corporation in&#13;
1993, a typical overcrowded industrial area with a sizable slum population, revealed that the major&#13;
causes of death were from chronic lung diseases, such as bronchitis, asthma and emphysema (10.5%),&#13;
cerebro-vascular diseases (8.5%), and pneumonia (7.3 %/6). The state will emphasize improving the&#13;
clinical skills in this area.&#13;
19.    DOHFW  would select several teaching institutions within the state to assist the district&#13;
hospitals in implementing their training program. During the early stages of the project, short on-site&#13;
courses and some of practical clinical training will be provided at the teaching institutions. The trainees&#13;
will later be posted at the district hospitals to obtain hands-on practical experience under close&#13;
supervision. After the initial two years of the project, the on-site courses and practical clinical training&#13;
will shift entirely to the district hospitals. Throughout the training period selected staff from the teaching&#13;
institutions will be posted at the district hospitals. The working group has prepared a plan outlining the&#13;
clinical training program. Table 9-3 describes the training program for various specialties.&#13;

knowledge and hospital administrators' skills. The important management issues that will be covered in&#13;
the training program are: personnel, finance, facility management, equipment management, consumable&#13;
supplies, information systems and general management. The intention of management training will be&#13;
to provide practical training to enhance the ability of administrative staff to face day-to-day problems.&#13;
Details of the program are shown in Table 4.&#13;
21.    Training Institution. Management training would be contracted to outside institutions. A&#13;
specific working group responsible for management training was established in each state during project&#13;
preparation. This group will continue to collaborate with designated institutions to work on the curricula&#13;
and training modules.&#13;
22.   Training Approach. Hospital management training will emphasize analysis of the existing&#13;
situation. The analytic steps of the process are: problem identification, objective setting, options-&#13;
appraisal and decision-making. The approach will be a continuing element in future management&#13;
activities. Case studies based on local situations will be developed for training purposes.&#13;
Management Training: Features Specific to Each State&#13;
30.    Karnataka. In order to improve the administrative capability of hospital managers, the state&#13;
will organize regular training course for Civil Surgeons, Assistant Surgeons and Nursing Supervisors.&#13;

specializing in hospital administration.&#13;
31.    Puniab. Considering the need for close interaction between primary care providers and other&#13;
district health officers, Punjab will conduct joint training of hospital managers and primary care&#13;
providers in addition to the regular management training to be provided under the pcoject.&#13;
32.    West Bengal. Management training would be provided by one of several training institutions:&#13;
ATI of Salt Lake, ASCI of Hyderabad, and IIHMR of Jaipur. Up to 10 scholarships have been&#13;
proposed for state level officials to strengthen management capacity.&#13;

REFERRAL SYSTEM&#13;
Objectives of a Referral System&#13;
1.     A well-functioning referral system is an institutional mechanism through which patients&#13;
with complex health problems are identified in a timely and systematic manner and examined,&#13;
investigated and/or treated promptly at an appropriate health care facility.  A multi-tier health&#13;
delivery system which combines preventive, curative and specialized care works efficiently when&#13;
the various tiers of the system are linked together through a referral mechanism. It works best&#13;
when the lowest tier (the primary care level) is easily accessible to the community and provides the&#13;
bulk of preventive care services as well as the first contact for treating commnon illnesses. Each&#13;
successive level provides services that are technically more complex, the higher tier providing&#13;
technical leadership and support for the lower tiers. Under such a system, the community has&#13;
confidence in the quality of care provided and patients understand that they will be referred in&#13;
accordance with their medical needs.&#13;
The Current Referral System in the Three States&#13;
2.     The referral system in Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal, as in the rest of India, does&#13;
not function well. The lower tiers are underutilized since patients proceed directly to higher level&#13;
hospitals for minor illness, thereby overloading the hospitals. Patients perceive the lower level&#13;
facilities as providing lower quality of services. The Beneficiary Assessment study in West Bengal&#13;
found that about 2% of the patients at first referral facilities were referred from PHCs.&#13;
3.     An effective referral system which minimizcs by-passing of lower levels of health facilities&#13;
is desirable. It is estimated that a third of all cascs which are currcntly treated at tertiary facilities&#13;
could be treated at lower cost at first referral facilities, if thosc facilities received adequate inputs.&#13;
Such a system would require:&#13;
*  services at each level -- primary, secondary and tertiary -- to be clearly defined;&#13;
*  service at each level to be of a quality promoting confidence among patients;&#13;
*  patients and the community to have the confidence that patients will be properly&#13;
referred and promptly transferred to higher levels of health care as needed;&#13;
*  the public to be made aware of the types of services available at each level of care; and&#13;
*  procedures to be implemented ensuring that patients do not by-pass lower level&#13;
facilities.&#13;
The New Referral System&#13;
4.     Under the project, the referral system  would be improved through strengthening the&#13;
following activities: (i) renovating and upgrading hospital buildings to provide appropriate space&#13;
for services; (ii) upgrading and updating clinical skills of physicians and nurses through an&#13;
effective training program; (iii) providing ambulances for transporting critical patients; and (iv)&#13;
installing phone, fax, and/or radio communications. It is expected that these hospitals will become&#13;
the referral point for the primary health care level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                                   Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
5.     The project would seek to ensure that a much higher proportion of patients comning to first&#13;
referral hospitals had been seen at PHCs and referred upwards. The project would implement&#13;
several measures to strengthen the referral system. These include: (a) introducing the use of&#13;
Referral and Feed Back Cards; (b) implementing the referral guidelines that specify the "what",&#13;
"when" and "how" of referrals; (c) establishing an incentive system for patients who follow referral&#13;
procedures; (d) establishing linkages and communications between the first referral hospitals and&#13;
primary care facilities through regular training and out-reach visits; (e) conducting intensive&#13;
information, education and communication (IEC) targeted at providers and the community; (f)&#13;
forming District Health Committees that will monitor the implementation of the referral system.&#13;
6.     Referral and Feedback Cards.  A new system of Referral and Feedback Cards will be&#13;
introduced. Once a decision is made to refer a patient to a higher level facility, the patient will&#13;
receive a Referral Card. The Referral Card will provide the patient direct access to the referred&#13;
hospital. The Referral Card will contain general information about the patient (such as: name, age,&#13;
address, and gender), clinical diagnosis, purpose of referral, and medical infornation (such as:&#13;
examinations conducted, investigations carried out, treatment received and the condition of the&#13;
patient). At the referred hospital, the patient could report directly to the unit or department to&#13;
which he or she has been referred, instead of going through the regular Out-Patient Department&#13;
(OPD). This card will be made available not only at the first referral hospitals but also at primary&#13;
health care facilities. Alternatively, a special counter for receiving referral patients may be a&#13;
preferred mechanism.&#13;
7.     After completion of investigation, treatment or consultancy at the referred hospital, the&#13;
patient will be reported back to the first facility. The referred hospital will provide the patient with&#13;
a Feedback Card. This card will include: general information about the patient, final diagnosis,&#13;
procedures and treatment given, type of investigation conducted, and follow-up advice. No new&#13;
ticket will be required for patients returning from the referred hospitals.&#13;
Referral Guidelines&#13;
8.     A  manual of referral guidelines will be issued to all institutions that wvill specify&#13;
procedures to make the system effective and acceptable to the community. It will consist of two&#13;
parts, administrative guidelines and the referral protocols.&#13;
9.     Administrative Guidelines. The administrative guidelines are expected to be completed in&#13;
the first year of project implementation and will provide the following information:&#13;
*  location of hospitals within the state district in order to ensure that referral of patients&#13;
are made to the nearest hospital;&#13;
*  transportation facilities that could be used for referral, in particular, the kind of&#13;
transport arrangements that could be required for critical patients;&#13;
*  operational hours of the referral hospitals, particularly, the opening hours of specialist&#13;
clinics, radiology department, laboratory hours, etc.;&#13;
*  examples of Referral and Feed Back Cards;&#13;
*  incentives to the patients for following the referral procedures.&#13;
10.    Referral Protocols. The referral protocols will be developed in a participatory manner by&#13;
a technical group consisting of senior clinical specialists. It will provide information on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
127                                    Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
*  service norms that elaborate the type of services provided at each level of care. During&#13;
project preparation, each state has streamlined its service norms and rationalized the&#13;
provision of services at different level of care.&#13;
*  patient conditions are needed to refer patients either for investigation or treatment at&#13;
higher level facilities for each area of specialization;&#13;
*  procedures to be followed before referring the patients; for example, for critical&#13;
patients, procedures that would stabilize the patient;&#13;
*  counseling for patients and the family prior to referral (such as: purpose of the&#13;
referral, benefits from referring the patient to another hospital, location of the referral&#13;
hospital and timing of admittance, likely events at the referred hospital, cost of medical&#13;
care, and precautions and preparation to be undertaken by the patient prior to hospital&#13;
admittance).&#13;
11.    Incentives to Patients. Efforts will be made to provide incentives to patients in order to&#13;
encourage proper referral procedures. Referred patients will not need to pay an out-patient fee at&#13;
the referred hospital. They will be able to report directly to the unit or departrnent to which they&#13;
have been referred without going through the OPD registration window. The referring hospital will&#13;
provide transporting at a suitable fee. The Referral and Feedback Cards will serve as tickets at the&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
12.    Technical SupDort to Primarv Level. The first referral hospitals will have closer linkages&#13;
with the primary level health facilities. Certain primary level facilities and community hospitals&#13;
will be grouped into one zone based on geographic location. An identified district or sub-divisional&#13;
hospital will be assigned responsibility for providing technical support to that particular zone.&#13;
Technical support will be carried out through:&#13;
*   dissemination of referral guidelines to primary level facilities;&#13;
*  training of staff from primary level facilities and community hospitals at the district&#13;
hospital or sub-divisional hospital;&#13;
*   regular meetings to discuss problems in clinical management at the primary level;&#13;
*  out-reach visits to provide on-the-spot consultation.&#13;
13.    Strengthening Referral Management. District Health Conmmittees, to be established under&#13;
the project, will make the referral system operational. The members of these committees will&#13;
include: a District Surgeon, a District Health and Family Welfare Officer, medical officers from&#13;
the taluka/subdivisional hospitals level, and superintendents of teaching hospitals, if available.&#13;
These committees will have the following responsibilities:&#13;
* identifying zones for referral, which link identified PHCs, CHCs and rural/community&#13;
hospitals to a particular district hospital, for the purpose of serving as a preferred&#13;
referral site and providing technical back-up for lower level facilities;&#13;
*  monitoring the implementation of the referral system which will be done by assessing&#13;
data from referral registers. In addition, the District Health Committees will review&#13;
feedback from primary care facilities;&#13;
* mobilizing transport for referral needs through collaboration between the Committee&#13;
and NGOs or other agencies; and&#13;
*  coordinating technical support for lower level of care, as required.&#13;
&#13;

14.    IEC support. An extensive IEC program has been proposed to support the development of&#13;
an effective referral system. There will be two target groups. The first target will be the providers&#13;
at the primary level and the first referral facilities. This group would mainly be provided&#13;
information about the guidelines and functioning of the referral system. The second group would be&#13;
the community which would be provided with information focusing on the benefits of using the&#13;
referral system. Additional information about IEC support is described in annex 15.&#13;
15.    Training. After the guidelines have been finalized, the staff of primary level and first&#13;
referral facilities will be familiarized with these documents through training. For staff at first&#13;
referral facilities, referral training will be integrated with clinical training or management training.&#13;
Features Specific to Each State&#13;
16.    Karnataka. The state has selected the districts of Chitradurga and Hassan as pilot areas&#13;
for implementing the referral system and for introducing the quality assurance program. By the end&#13;
of the third year, when the upgrading of the physical structure at the first referral hospitals are&#13;
complete and the clinical and management training program are in place, the referral system will be&#13;
implemented throughout the state.&#13;
17.    The state has also developed a plan to improve the linkages between primary and first&#13;
referral levels. As mentioned earlier, primary care facilities and communuity hospitals will be&#13;
included in one zone, and an identified sub-district or district will be assigned to provide technical&#13;
support for each zone. In Kamataka, technical support will be provided through:&#13;
*  dissemination of referral administrative guidelines and referral protocols to the&#13;
facilities;&#13;
*  regular meetings and briefings with physicians of primary level facilities to discuss&#13;
problems of clinical management;&#13;
*  out-reach visits to PHCs and CHCs by consultants from the district hospitals for&#13;
providing on-the spot consultation for selected cases and practical demonstration of&#13;
selected management techniques.&#13;
18.    For tribal communities, the state has proposed annual health check-ups to identify health&#13;
problems. Those who require treatment or further investigation will get a Referral Card to go to the&#13;
appropriate health facilities.&#13;
19.    Puniab. The state has proposed a color coded Referral Card. Blue Referral Cards will be&#13;
used by community and area hospitals, green cards by sub-divisional hospitals and white cards by&#13;
district hospitals. At the hospitals, there will be a separate counter or window for accepting&#13;
referred patients to avoid long waiting time. After registration, referred patients will be guided&#13;
directly to the concerned specialist for consultation, examination, investigation or further treatment.&#13;
Referred patients will be given preference over other patients and will be examined by the most&#13;
senior specialists available.&#13;
20.    West Bengal. Special attention will be given to establish a referral mechanism for the&#13;
Sunderbans area, where 8 Block PHCs and 28 PHCs are included in the project. The Government&#13;
will approach the Zilla Parishads to construct rest housesgfor the patients and their families. These&#13;
are not accounted for under the project.&#13;

21.    Regarding training for the referral system, the state's working group has developed a&#13;
training agenda. It decided that the persons to receive training will be medical officers, specialists,&#13;
superintendents, administrators, block medical officers of health (BMOH), nursing staff, ward&#13;
masters and SWOs. Training for the medical officers, specialists, superintendents and BMOH will&#13;
be for 3 days, conducted at district hospitals and cover the following materials: service norms at&#13;
various levels of care; flow of referral mechanism; use of communication; referral guidelines; use&#13;
of Referral and Feedback Cards; and IEC and HMIS orientation. Training for nursing staff, ward&#13;
masters and SWOs will be for a day at sub-divisional hospitals and will cover the following&#13;
materials: arrangement of vehicles for referring patients; filling up Referral and Feedback Cards&#13;
and explaining to patients the importance of the referral; providing counseling and guidance; and&#13;
other relevant topics.&#13;

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM IN HOSPITALS&#13;
1.    Quality Assurance (QA) is an approach to building institutional capacity and organizational&#13;
culture that focuses on continuous improvements in service delivery and on consumer satisfaction. It is&#13;
an on-going process that monitors the shortfalls in quality and implements remedial measures to address&#13;
these shortfalls. A well planned QA program would empower rr-nagers, clinicians and technicians to&#13;
monitor the quality of care provided by their own hospitals aor assist in instituting rapid remedial&#13;
measures wherever shortfalls in quality are noticed. The program will cover as many clinical activities&#13;
as possible, but will focus on a few selected aspects at the beginning of the project.&#13;
2.     Quality of care has many aspects, such as care, courtesy and comfort; technical aspects such as&#13;
safety of care; and managerial aspects such as availability of resources and cleanliness of the facility.&#13;
To implement a QA program, it is necessary to clearly define indicators for each aspect of quality in&#13;
order to monitor the improvement over time.&#13;
Objectives and Scope of the Quality Assurance Program&#13;
3.     The states propose to implement a systematic program of quality assurance that covers several&#13;
aspects of clinical quality, user satisfaction and management of resources. This program will help to&#13;
ensure that other project interventions, such as improvement of physical buildings, provision of new&#13;
medical equipment, streamlining of service delivery norms, strengthening of clinical and management&#13;
capacity and improvement of the hospital information system, will actually translate into better quality&#13;
of care.&#13;
4.     Since QA is a new program, each state will identify two districts to be the initial project sites&#13;
during the first year of project implementation. All hospitals in these two districts will implement the&#13;
QA program.&#13;
5.     The QA program would consist of the following components: First, a QA committee would be&#13;
established at the state level. This committee would develop an overall policy framework for quality&#13;
improvement throughout the state. Second, several QA working groups would be assigned. These&#13;
working groups would develop guidelines and necessary tools for implementing QA program in priority&#13;
areas. These guidelines would be tested in hospitals in two selected districts chosen as pilot sites. After&#13;
a year, a comprehensive evaluation of the pilot sites would be conducted and necessary adjustments of&#13;
the guidelines would be made. A state wide implementation would start the second year of the project.&#13;
Responsible QA officials will work closely with teams responsible for clinical training, management&#13;
training and equipment provision.&#13;
6.     Ouality Assurance Committee. Each state would set up a State Quality of Care comrnittee.&#13;
The main task of this committee would be to develop a policy framework for the QA program for the&#13;
whole state. This conmnittee will undertake the following steps:&#13;
* identify influential opinion leaders from among several groups involved in health care delivery at&#13;
hospitals. This would include professional groups such as: specialists, doctors and nurses; hospital&#13;
managers, such as hospital directors or superintendents; union leaders; other managerial groups,&#13;
such as district coordinators; and representatives of the conmnunity.&#13;
*  plan a systematic program of consensus-building among-these opinion leaders. This would include&#13;
holding seminars to give information on the benefits and limitations of QA and workshops to&#13;
involve opinion leaders in consultative decision making regarding the development of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
131                                    Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Seminar and workshop activities would include developing or reviewing indicators, setting&#13;
standards for quality, and suggesting aspects of quality that should be monitored.&#13;
* identify priority areas. The suggested priority areas are obstetrics, pediatrics, medicine, surgery,&#13;
orthopedics, anesthesia and nursing.&#13;
* identify working groups that will work on details of the selected areas of specialty.&#13;
7.     Quality Assurance Working Groups. Several working groups will be established to work on the&#13;
details of each area of specialty that has been selected as priority. The members of each working group&#13;
will consist of specialists in that particular area, hospital administrators and physicians who have&#13;
worked in lower level hospitals (first referral hospital). These groups will design the quality assessment&#13;
tools, conduct evaluations of the current quality of services in selected hospitals, develop guidelines for&#13;
the implementation of QA programs, and monitor the implementation of QA at the pilot sites.&#13;
Consultants will be appointed to assist the working groups.&#13;
Activities to be Undertaken by the QA Working Groups&#13;
8.     Qualitv Assessment. The first stage of program development is to establish procedures for quality&#13;
assessment. This involves the development of acceptable standards, key indicators and methods for regular&#13;
periodic assessment of the quality of selected aspects of care provided in hospitals. The QA working group&#13;
at the state level will define the priority cases in the areas of medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics,&#13;
orthopedics, anesthesia and nursing in which the quality of care will be improved during the life of the project.&#13;
The criteria for priority selection are the most frequent cases admitted to the hospital or those that constitute a&#13;
significant burden of disease. Examples include: pediatric cases, acute respiratory tract infections and&#13;
diarrheal diseases. The group will assign sub groups to work on standards of procedures and identification of&#13;
suitable indicators for monitoring the quality of service.&#13;
9.     The steps in setting up quality assessment for the selected areas of focus are: (a) identify&#13;
suitable indicators for monitoring quality; (b) set acceptable standards; (c) pilot test methods of data&#13;
collection e.g. routine records, interviews with patients, set-up complaints mechanism, focus group&#13;
discussions with selected "clients" (women users, community leaders, tribal groups etc.); (d) review data&#13;
that has been collected and review indicators and proposed standards; (e) establish regular on-going&#13;
methods of data generation; and (f) establish procedures for reviewing the data and identifying hospitals&#13;
which have shortfalls in quality.&#13;
10.    Evaluation of the Current Quality. A detailed analysis will be conducted in selected hospitals,&#13;
to assess the discrepancies between the standards and the actual practices. Observation guides based on&#13;
accepted treatment norms would be used to document where patient care fell short of the standard.&#13;
Based on the results of this analysis, each hospital would develop its own plan of action to correct&#13;
lapses in technical quality and implement the correction action through direct supervision and on-the-job&#13;
training. In applying the concept it is important to note that the evaluation process is not concerned&#13;
with results that are theoretically achievable if there were unlimited manpower, skills, money or&#13;
equipment, but rather with optimum results that can be achieved in a particular hospital given the&#13;
available resources. QA is concemed with determining the difference between an optimum achievable&#13;
result, given the available resources, and the result that is actually being achieved.&#13;
11.    Ouality Improvement at Pilot Sites. A Quality Improvement (QI) group will be set up in each&#13;
of the hospitals. QI groups will be formed from among the staff who are responsible for the provision&#13;
of care in the area which has a shortfall in quality. The Ql groups would identify some performance&#13;
indicators that are easy to access, such as hospital acquired infection rate, wound infection rate and&#13;
patient complaint rate. With the assistance of the QA Coordinator, the QI group would: (a) investigate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
132                                   Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
factors contributing to shortfalls in quality; (b) develop strategies for remedying shortfalls in quality and&#13;
prepare an implementation plan; (c) submit a report of the investigation and the implementation plan to&#13;
the QA Committee at the state level; and (d) implement the plan.&#13;
12.    Criteria Audit. Criteria auditing is a system to assess a hospital's patient care management&#13;
using criteria which have been developed by that particular hospital. By careful choice of criteria, it is&#13;
possible to determine whether a procedure was justified, whether the process of care was satisfactory&#13;
and whether the outcome was as desired. A subject of study, say a disease, would be selected by staff&#13;
concerned with the subject. The criteria for screening, diagnostic, treatment and outcome would be&#13;
developed and agreed by the QI group. The criteria are simplified and where possible quantified so that&#13;
any designated hospital personnel can check whether the criteria have been met. In a case where the&#13;
criteria have not been met, the QI committee would study the record-, to see if any departure from the&#13;
criteria is justified.&#13;
13.    Medical Audit.  In case of disputes or unexpected mortality, a medical audit would be&#13;
conducted. It examines retrospectively the clinical application of medical knowledge and compares care&#13;
rendered to preset standard of excellence.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
14.    State-wide implementation of the QA program would be undertaken after the conclusion of the&#13;
pilot testing. The first step in implementation would be to train hospital staff in quality assurance. Staff&#13;
must be aware of the principles and practical application in their discipline of quality assurance. The&#13;
training would be a short orientation course about the basic concept and approach in QA or a special&#13;
course of I or two weeks. The next step would be to implement the strategies or actions that will&#13;
improve the quality or overcome the identified problem.&#13;
15.    During the implementation, several approaches can be used to help identifv the problems within&#13;
a hospital. Where possible, existing information would be used as part of the review and evaluation.&#13;
This information would be in the form of incident reports, mortality rates, infections and complications&#13;
etc. and would usually be generated on a continuing basis. Other information may have to be collected&#13;
through the use of patient questionnaires, observation or other methods.&#13;
Management of QA Program.&#13;
16.    Management of the QA program in each state will follow the overall management structure as&#13;
laid out in Annex 8. Specifically, in K    the Joint Director for Hospitals will supervise the QA&#13;
program at the state level, while at the district level the District Surgeon will oversee the QA program.&#13;
In Puniab, the Joint Director for Referral, QA and Medical Audit will manage the QA program at the&#13;
state level, while the Assistant District Coordinator of Administration will oversee its implementation at&#13;
the district level. In West BenRal, the Additional Director of Health and Medical I will be responsible&#13;
for supervising the QA program at the state level, while the Assistant Project Officer of Administration&#13;
will oversee its implementation at the district level.&#13;
17.    Project SupRort. The project will support the activities of QA committee and QA working&#13;
groups at the state level. This will include: meetings, workshops, consultants, and development of&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
&#13;

MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT&#13;
1.    Waste management is a part of the routine hygiene and maintenance activities of a health facility.&#13;
Basic requirements such as reliable water supply, sanitary facilities, disinfection procedures and equipment are&#13;
vital to keep a health facility clean and at a satisfactory level of hygiene. Medical waste should be carefully&#13;
managed -- from the point of generation to final disposal. In most circumstances it is appropriate to consider&#13;
an incremental approach to addressing medical waste management issues at the institutional level.&#13;
2.    Inappropriate management of medical waste could cause transmission of HIV/AIDS virus, Hepatitis&#13;
B or Hepatitis C virus. This could happen through injuries caused by syringe needles or sharp instruments&#13;
that are infected by contaminated human blood. In addition to the above risks, hospital water sewage could&#13;
also transmit some diseases such as cholera to the surrounding neighborhoods.&#13;
3.     Medical waste may be produced in hospitals, health centers, clinics, nursing homes, laboratories,&#13;
research institutes, veterinary clinics, midwifery and other medical care conducted at home. About 85% of&#13;
medical wastes are non-hazardous wastes, 10% are infectious and around 5% are non-infectious but hazardous&#13;
wastes. The amount of waste generated varies by type of facility. In developed countries, waste generated&#13;
from general hospitals is estimated to be about 2.54.5 kg per bed day, while in Latin America it varies from&#13;
1.04.5 kg per bed day. A recent study estimated medical waste generated at hospitals in Bombay, Delhi and&#13;
Madras to range from 0.85 to 2.25 kg per bed day.&#13;
Classifications of Medical Waste&#13;
4.     There are several classifications used to categorize medical waste. WHO suggests the following:&#13;
General waste:     all non-hazardous wastes, similar in nature to domestic wastes.&#13;
Pathological       tissues, organs, body parts, human fetuscs, most blood and body fluids.&#13;
wastes:&#13;
Radioactive waste:  solid, gaseous waste contaminated with radionuclides generated from&#13;
diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.&#13;
Chemical waste:    solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals used in diagnostic, experimental work or&#13;
cleaning and disinfecting procedures. For the purpose of waste handling,&#13;
chemical waste should be categorized as toxic, corrosive, flammable,&#13;
reactive or genotoxic.&#13;
Infectious waste:    pathogens in sufficient concentration or quantity that could cause diseases.&#13;
Sharps:            needles, syringes, scalpels, etc.&#13;
Pharmaceutical     pharmaceutical products, drugs, chemicals that have been returned from&#13;
waste:             wards, spilled, outdated or contaminated.&#13;
Pressurized        those used for demonstration or instructional purposes, containing gas,&#13;
containers:        aerosol cans.&#13;
5.     Since there is an overlap between some of the categories, it may be advisable for developing countries&#13;
to use the following simplified classification for practical reasons: i) general wastes; ii) sharps; iii) infectious&#13;
waste other than infected sharps; iv) chemical and pharmaceutical wastes; and v) other hazardous hospital or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
134                                    Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
medical wastes. Limiting the number of categories to five instead of eight will limit the number of separate&#13;
waste collection and storage channels.&#13;
The Process of Waste Management&#13;
6.    In general, the process of medical waste management at a particular hospital could be viewed as&#13;
shown in figure 1:&#13;
Figure 1: Flow of Hospital's Solid Waste&#13;
Source of                      Temporary                    Final&#13;

internal                      external&#13;
transportation                transportation&#13;
7. -   Source of Waste. Waste can be generated in the patient ward, operating room, or examination room.&#13;
At this stage, infectious wastes, sharps and hazardous wastes will be segregated from general wastes and put&#13;
into different channels for disposal. The segregation of medical waste will be done by putting the waste into&#13;
different colored bags.&#13;
8.    Intemal Transportation. Internal transportation involves transporting the waste from the point of&#13;
generation to the place of temporary storage within the hospital. It is important that all colored bags are&#13;
securely fastened with adhesive plastic tape. The trolleys or carts must have surfaces which are smooth and&#13;
impermeable, that can be easily cleaned and drained, and that allow the waste to be easily loaded, secured and&#13;
unloaded. At all times, care should be taken to maintain bags in an upright position to prevent leakage.&#13;
9.     Temporar Storage. A temporary storage facility should be provided by designating an adequate&#13;
storage area to store the waste separately in accordance with color coded bags before finally disposing the&#13;
waste. If an incinerator is located within the hospital compound, the storage point should be as close as&#13;
possible to the incinerator site. The storage room should be kept secure, so that unauthorized persons would&#13;
not have access to the waste. Also, it should be kept out of the reach of animals, such as dogs, cats and&#13;
rodents.&#13;
10.    External Transportation: External transportation involves transporting the waste from temporary&#13;
storage to the final the disposal site. If the final disposal site, for example, an incinerator, is within the&#13;
hospital compound then no special vehicle will be needed. However, in certain urban areas the state&#13;
governments have decided to have one incinerator serve several hospitals, and will make the necessary&#13;
arrangements for transporting the waste.&#13;
11.    Final disposal of Solid Waste. Medical solid waste should never be disposed into water because of the&#13;
risks of polluting the water with chemical and microbiological materials. Therefore, solid waste should be&#13;
disposed at a land site or by the use of an incinerator.&#13;
12.    Present Practice. Due to insufficient resources and/or lack of understanding about the effects of&#13;
medical waste, safety in handling medical waste has not been a priority in the health care system in Indian&#13;
states. A study of waste disposal in a rural teaching hospital in. India revealed the following practices. Normal&#13;
waste was disposed in an open ground and burnt at irregular intervals. Disposable needles and plastic syringes&#13;
were discarded along with other general waste. Used surgical dressing, pads, cotton and gauze were disposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
135                                  Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
in open ground. Biological waste was treated more carefully, by disposing to the incinerator. Liquid or fluid&#13;
waste, including blood or other body fluids, was directly discharged into the sewer and sewage system&#13;
although the hospital was connected to the general municipal waste water system. Chemical wastes from&#13;
laboratories were washed off with water and discharged into the sane waste water system. All types of&#13;
hospital waste were transported from the point of generation to the main storage through hospital corridors in&#13;
small uncovered buckets. The waste was not sorted before being transported. The hospital incinerator was&#13;
operated and maintained by an operator who was not trained with respect to desired temperature, retention&#13;
timne, handling procedures, etc.. In the absence of relevant guidelines, any waste that was brought to the&#13;
incinerator was incinerated without sorting through the waste. Clearly much needs to be done to improve the&#13;
management of the waste disposal system at the hospital level.&#13;
Project Support&#13;
13.    The project will support the improvement of medical waste management in a comprehensive manner.&#13;
This would mean that implementation of existing policies and reguiations would be supported with adequate&#13;
budget, training and monitoring for compliance.&#13;
14.    Following a review of the existing practices, discussions with state, district and facility level&#13;
authorities were held to formulate a better approach for medical waste management. The issues discussed&#13;
included: systems development, development of a state-wide comprehensive plan for disposal of medical waste,&#13;
and an implementation plan. Key elements of such a plan to be adopted include: segregation of waste using&#13;
color coded containers; improvement of transportation, storage and final disposal methods; and improvement&#13;
of the handler's knowledge and handling skill through extensive training. By improving waste management,&#13;
the risk of affecting human health or the environment would be minimized.&#13;
Systems Development&#13;
15.   The project will support the development of a system to improve mcdical waste management. At the&#13;
state level, a Waste Management Unit will be set up and led by a person who has a management background.&#13;
This unit would be responsible for medical waste and related matters for the entire state, with its main concem&#13;
being the development of waste management policy, implementation strategies, coordination and monitoring&#13;
capacity. The expected outcomes of this unit would be as follow:&#13;
* Develop state level medical waste policy in line with the environmental protection policy;&#13;
*  Develop a comprehensive plan for the entire state, which would include all sectors concemed with&#13;
medical waste;&#13;
* Review policy;&#13;
* Coordinate inter-sectoral collaboration with regard to medical waste management, particularly in&#13;
urban areas;&#13;
. Develop guidelines related to medical waste handling that include segregation, storage,&#13;
transportation and final disposal; and&#13;
* Monitor implementation.&#13;
16.    At the district level, the District Health Committee would be the nodal point. The expected capacities&#13;
on medical waste matters are as follows:&#13;
* Supervisory capacity; to make sure that other hospitals or other primary care facilities at the&#13;
district area are implementing the waste managemnent system;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
136                                      Annex 10&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
*  Training capacity to provide training for staff who handle medical waste. For physicians, training&#13;
for medical waste handling would be integrated with the clinical skill training;&#13;
*  Logistics capacity for storage and distribution of bags and other supplies; and&#13;
*  Coordination capacity to coordinate the use of incinerators for several hospitals, especially in&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
17.    Facility Level. Each state has prepared a plan for improvement of the medical waste disposal for its&#13;
health facilities. This includes all first referral hospitals, tertiary hospitals and primary care facilities. These&#13;
facilities would segregate their medical wastes at the point of generation by putting infectious wastes, sharps&#13;
and hazardous wastes into different colored containers and different channels for disposal. For the purpose of&#13;
internal transportation, closed storage bins with wheels and wheel barrows will be provided to all hospitals&#13;
under the project. For final disposal, the states have proposed to adopt three methods: incinerators for large&#13;
institutions, purolators for small institutions, and burial method in wells or pits for primary care facilities. The&#13;
plan is provided in Table 1.&#13;
Features Specific to Each State&#13;
18.    Karnataka. Community/rural, sub-divisional and district hospitals would be provided with color-&#13;
coded closed bins with wheels as containers for segregating medical waste. In addition, wheel barrows will&#13;
also be provided for transporting the waste to the temporary storage area.&#13;
19.    All hospitals with 50 beds and above will be installed with incinerators. For small hospitals, such as&#13;
30 bedded hospitals, the state has proposed to provide purolators. For large cities (i.e., Bangalore, Mysore&#13;
and Hubli-Dharwad), the government has proposed to develop special landfills specifically for the disposal of&#13;
medical waste. In these cities there are many health facilities that could share the use of these landfills instead&#13;
of installing their own incinerators. It is also proposed that at a later stage the operation and maintenance of&#13;
thesc landfills could be financed through cost-sharing among the users.&#13;
20.    The Government of Karnataka has included the following specifications to ensure the safe operation of&#13;
the incinerators: (i) all emissions and residues should be pathogen free; (ii) chimneys must be designed and&#13;
constructed to remove combustion gasses effectively; (iii) incinerators must be safc to operate; and (iv)&#13;
incinerator capacity and feed rate should be adequate.&#13;
21.    For small institutions, such as PHCs and sub-center hospitlas, there is no proper provision for garbage&#13;
removal by the local authorities, even for ordinary garbage. The Government has decided that at these&#13;
institutions deep pits will be excavated in their back yards which will serve as the final disposal for medical&#13;
waste. Under the project, specific guidelines will be developed and disseminated to these facilities.&#13;
22.    Puniab. At present no first referral hospitals are provided with incinerators. With project assistance&#13;
incinerators of various capacities would be provided to all hospitals based on their bed strength and the&#13;
amount of waste likely to be generated at these institutions. 30 to 50 bedded hospitals will be provided with&#13;
incinerators of RI type, 100 to 200 bedded hospitals with R2 type, 400 bedded hospitals with P40 and those&#13;
with more than 500 beds with PIoo type.&#13;
23.    At the primary care facilities, including sub-centers, PHCs and CHCs, the state would construct deep&#13;
pits within the compound of these institutions. The project will support development of guidelines, manuals&#13;
and conduct necessary training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
137                                   Annex 10&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
24.   West Bengal. An assessment was conducted of waste disposal methods in several Calcutta hospitals.&#13;
The assessment recommended that hospitals should make their own arrangements in dealing with waste&#13;
generated, since training of municipal staff for this purpose would be difficult. The state has accordingly&#13;
proposed to adopt methods of medical waste disposal through the use of incinerators, purolators for stearn&#13;
sterilization and K-type wells for the burial system. During the first two years the project will concentrate on&#13;
first referral hospitals. However, gradually the plan will include guidelines for tertiary and private hospitals.&#13;
25.   Incinerators will be made available for districts hospitals and some sub-divisional hospitals, where the&#13;
number of beds are larger than 300. In installing these incinerators, several guidelines from the government,&#13;
especially from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, will be taken into consideration. For rural hospitals,&#13;
the state has proposed the use of the K-type well. The K-type well is well-lined with earthen rings or concrete&#13;
rings. The well has annular concrete steining and is plugged at the bottom. A concrete cover with locking&#13;
arrangement will be provided on the top.&#13;
26.    Training. The Government of West Bengal has developed a strategy for conducting training on&#13;
medical waste management. Training of the hospital superintendents will be incorporated in the Hospital&#13;
Management Training Program; training for doctors, nurses and technicians will be integrated in the clinical&#13;
skill training program. A prograrn for one day training at sub-divisional and district hospitals would be&#13;
developed for ward masters and sweepers.&#13;

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES&#13;
AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS&#13;
A. Epidemiological Surveillance of Communicable Diseases&#13;
1.    Epidemiological surveillance is the ongoing and systematic collection, analysis and&#13;
interpretation of health data in order to describe and monitor health events. Surveillance activities&#13;
include data collection, data compilation and processing, interpretation, actions taken and feed-back&#13;
(see Chart 1). The project will address only major communicable diseases, and the diseases to be&#13;
monitored will vary by state. Explicit criteria for these communicable diseases will be defined to avoid&#13;
any ambiguity in reporting by different institutions.&#13;
2.     Under this project, the states will establish a comprehensive and effective surveillance system,&#13;
which would aim at describing health events over time in a simple, flexible, acceptable, sensitive, and&#13;
accurate manner. The main purpose of this effort is to strengthen the capacity of district and state level&#13;
health administrations to monitor major communicable diseases and to prevent an outbreak or epidemic.&#13;
The development of a surveillance capacity and response capability for major communicable diseases&#13;
will focus on the following steps: identification through education of health workers and community&#13;
involvement; indexing of cases or isolation of cases and treatment; and tracing of contacts for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. In the long-term, however, the surveillance system would need to be&#13;
expanded to include preventive examninations and immnunization of groups most likely to be infected; and&#13;
an enhanced response capability in case of outbreaks or epidemic. This project would fill some of the&#13;
gaps in the national disease programs by linking the three elements noted above and by providing&#13;
treatment at the secondary hospital level.&#13;
3.    In order to achieve these objectives, the states will institute the following approach: (i) enhance&#13;
data collection from various facilities; (ii) promote community involvement in data collection; (iii)&#13;
define and strengthen those organizational structures at district and state levels which are responsible&#13;
for surveillance; (iv) strengthen the capacity and capability of district level health administrator to&#13;
analyze and interpret data; (v) enhance the district level health admninistrator capability to provide a&#13;
rapid response to problems; and (vi) strengthen collaboration between district and state level health&#13;
administrators and various service delivery facilities.&#13;
4.     A working group was established in each state to conduct an assessment of the existing&#13;
surveillance system. Currently, a basic surveillance system exists at the primary health care level at&#13;
public facilities in Punjab, Karnataka and West Bengal. This surveillance system covers subcenters,&#13;
PHCs and Block PHCs. However, at the secondary or tertiary level there is virtually no surveillance&#13;
mechanism. The diseases that are reported and monitored at the primary level are mostly vaccine-&#13;
preventable diseases. Communicable diseases, which are treated at the secondary level, are therefore&#13;
not monitored by any institution.&#13;
Concept&#13;
5.     Data Collection. The comprehensive surveillance system proposed in the project will cover all&#13;
health care facilities, both public and private, throughout the states. The working group recommended&#13;
that the existing surveillance activities at the primary care level be integrated into the proposed state&#13;
surveillance system. The system will collect information on specific communicable diseases from these&#13;
facilities through regular reporting forms. In addition to the routine data collection, special efforts are&#13;
being proposed by the states. In rural areas of Punjab, information from the community level regarding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
140                                    Annex 11&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
communicable diseases will be collected by the multi-purpose health workers (MPHW, male and&#13;
female) during their routine field visits.  West Bengal will introduce a stamped red card for quick&#13;
transmission of information when a case of communicable disease occurs. The card will contain&#13;
essential data (name, age, sex, address, etc.) of every patient who suffered or died from the disease. As&#13;
soon as a case is detected, the card will be completed by the health provider and posted to the District&#13;
Surveillance Unit. In Karnataka, taluka hospitals will monitor surveillance reports from primary care&#13;
facilities within their areas. Anganwadi workers, school teachers and Gram Panchayat members would&#13;
provide community level information for the surveillance system.&#13;
6.     During project preparation, the states designed formats for daily, weekly and monthly reporting&#13;
of the incidence and prevalence of the identified diseases. Before implementing a state-wide program,&#13;
these formats will be tested in a pilot area of each state. At the hospital level, the project will&#13;
strengthen the information system on out-patients and in-patients. In addition, the project will introduce&#13;
a surveillance mechanism which will enable reporting of certain communicable diseases which are&#13;
treated at the hospitals through the regular reporting system.&#13;
7.     Strengthenina District Level.  At the district level, a District Surveillance Unit will be&#13;
established. This unit will receive reports from various facilities within the districts, process and&#13;
analyze the data, and provide information on trends of the monitored diseases. The Unit will therefore&#13;
be able to provide early warning signals of epidemic outbreaks and alert the other officials within the&#13;
district about the situation. The Unit will perform the following functions:&#13;
-  Act as a nodal surveillance unit at the district level, receiving regular reports from private&#13;
as well as public facilities (primary health care facilities and hospitals). In addition, the&#13;
Unit will receive red cards directly from health facilities, in case any communicable disease&#13;
is identified;&#13;
*  Analyze the data and review morbidity and mortality trends of the monitored diseases from&#13;
time to time;&#13;
&#149;  1'rovide early warning signals of epidemic outbreaks and alert the health officials about the&#13;
condition;&#13;
*  Coordinate with other related government agencies and local bodies, such as PWD, Fishery&#13;
Department, Irrigation Department, Indian Medical Association and Zilla Panchayat.&#13;
*  Assist local health facilities when there are increased cases, in order to overcome the&#13;
problem and prevent spreading of the disease to other areas; and&#13;
*  Send regular reports to the state level and provide feedback to health facilities.&#13;
8.     These district units will be headed by an epidemiologist and consist of sufficient technical staff&#13;
including an entomologist, microbiologist, statistician and medical officers. The units will be equipped&#13;
with a computer and specific software (e.g. Epi-Info) to process the incoming data from public and&#13;
private facilities within the district. The program will provide information on morbidity and mortality&#13;
patterns of the specific monitored diseases. In the event of an increase in the number of cases or deaths,&#13;
necessary action will be taken immediately.&#13;
9.     State Surveillance Unit. A State Surveillance Unit will be established at the state level This&#13;
Unit will become a nodal office for epidemiological surveillance of the entire state. Chart 2. shows the&#13;
flow of reports of various facilities from the district level to the state level. In West Bengal, the State&#13;
Bureau of Health Intelligence (SBHI) will be strengthenred and function as a state unit, while in&#13;
Karnataka, the state has proposed to transform the Health Intelligence Unit, presently functioning in the&#13;
Directorate of Health, into the State Surveillance Unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
10.    Additional Staff. Table I shows the staffing pattern proposed by each state for the District&#13;
Surveillance Unit and State Surveillance Unit. These posts will be filled through transfer of existing&#13;
staff and new recruitment. Karnataka has proposed the establishment of 20 District Surveillance&#13;
Units. About 100 additional staff will be required for these districts. These include entomologists,&#13;
micro-biologists, statisticians, medical officers and drivers. The district epidemiologist post will be&#13;
filled by existing staff. Punjab has proposed that all hospitals with 100 beds or more have a Health&#13;
Supervisor to fill out necessary report forms and undertake any case or outbreak investigation under the&#13;
supervision of a Senior Medical Officer or District Epidemiologist.&#13;
11.     Training.  An extensive training program has been designed by each state to support the&#13;
effectiveness of the surveillance system. The training for District Epidemiologist and key officials of&#13;
State Surveillance Units will be trained at the National Institute of Conmmunicable Diseases (NICD).&#13;
Health officials from various facilities will be trained at the district level (District Surveillance Unit)&#13;
with focus on the surveillance system and familiarization with reporting forms. For community-based&#13;
reporting the training will be conducted by the District Surveillance Unit.&#13;
Features Specific to Each State&#13;
12.    Karnataka. The state will transform the Health Intelligence Unit, currently functioning at the&#13;
Directorate of Health, into the State Surveillance Unit. Presently there are several Joint Directors (JD)&#13;
dealing with communicable disease, i.e., JD of Communicable Diseases, JD for Malaria, JD for&#13;
Tuberculosis and JD for Leprosy. These Joint Directors are responsible for prevention and control&#13;
activities, including surveillance of these particular diseases. It was proposed that the status of Joint&#13;
Director of Communicable Disease, within the newly structured State Surveillance Unit, will be&#13;
upgraded to that of an Additional Director post (see Chart 2 of Annex 8). At the district level,&#13;
surveillance activities related to the project will be coordinated by the District Surgeon and existing&#13;
surveillance of the vertical program will continue to be monitored by the District Health and FW&#13;
Officer.&#13;
13.    Puniab. At the state level, an Epidemiological Cell will be created and will be under the&#13;
coordination of Punjab Health System Corporation's Director of Medical Management. At the district&#13;
level, the surveillance activities will be headed by Assistant District Coordinator, Administration.&#13;
14.    At the hospital level, there is currently no infrastructure for conducting surveillance of&#13;
communicable diseases. It is proposed that all hospitals with 100 beds or more have a Health&#13;
Supervisor, who will fill out necessary report forms and undertake any case or outbreak investigation&#13;
under the supervision of the Senior Medical Officer or District Epidemiologist. This supervisor is also&#13;
to provide feed-back to the peripheral workers in the lower level facilities.&#13;
15.    With  regard  to  surveillance training, the  Corporation  will train  State  and  District&#13;
Epidemiologists at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) for one month. The&#13;
training of the SMO and MO will be arranged at SIHFW  Kharar, Family Welfare Training Center,&#13;
Amritsar, for a period of 5 working days. Health supervisors and other staff will be given training&#13;
within their district for about 2 days. The period of training can, however, be increased depending upon&#13;
the feed-back received.&#13;
16.    West Bengal. At the state level, surveillance activities supported by the project will be&#13;
coordinated by Additional Director Health &amp; Medical II (see Chart 6 of Annex 8). At the district level,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
142                                    Annex 11&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
it will be under the Assistant Project Officer, Administration. Opportunities for involving the private&#13;
sector will be explored.&#13;
B. Health Management Information System&#13;
17.    The Health Management Information System or HMIS is a mechanism for monitoring health&#13;
information which assists organizational needs, program implementation and monitoring, problem&#13;
solving, and system integration. The advantage of having an HMIS is that it allows for gathering,&#13;
processing, and analyzing of health data and provides quick insight into health performance indicators.&#13;
This in turn assists the implementation of programs that contribute to the improvement of health status.&#13;
Moreover, the improved data availability and linkage throughout the health care system allows for better&#13;
management and more efficient resource allocation. It also facilitates better monitoring of performance&#13;
indicators and surveillance of major communicable diseases&#13;
18.    Under the project, the state's HMIS will be strengthened by: i) making provisions for the linking&#13;
and sharing of health data at the three health care levels through computerization; ii) improving the&#13;
hospital information system; iii) strengthening the district level capacity to analyze data; and iv)&#13;
providing training for data analysis and computer use.&#13;
19.    Computerization of HMIS. The states will install computers at three levels: state head quarters,&#13;
district levels and at selected hospitals. Information will be passed between all three levels and in the&#13;
long run the computers themselves may be actually linked through a network. At the statc lveel, the&#13;
project will provide a Local Area Network (LAN) with a server and several work stations. This will&#13;
data from the districts; ii) analyze the data gathered; iii) provide feedback to districts; and iv) back-up&#13;
data allow the state head-quarters to: i) act as a nodal point for the compiling of gathered. The state&#13;
head quarters will also be responsible for development of software modules for the state-wide HMIS&#13;
and function as a training center for the district level. At the district level, one or more computers will&#13;
be installed to facilitate the entry of data from hospitals and perhaps PHCs. The district level HMIS will&#13;
also have limited capacity to analyze gathered data, before passing it to the state level. At selected&#13;
hospitals. a computer would be installed which will assist patient admission and registration, patient&#13;
and hospital accounting, management of medical records, patients care, office automation, inventory;&#13;
and overall administration. Synthesized hospital data Will be sent on a regular basis to the district level.&#13;
20.    Improvement of the Hospital Information System. The states will improve the hospital&#13;
information system through: i) development of standardized formats for in-patient records, out-patient&#13;
cards, registration and other forms; ii) revision of monthly/annually reporting format to be submitted by&#13;
hospitals; iii) improvement of storage facilities for medical records, and iv) training of medical records&#13;
person. The project will provide computers for selected hospitals.&#13;
21.    StrengtheninR of District Capacitv. In addition to computers installation, HMIS staff will be&#13;
trained to perform limited data analysis. The analysis will focus on evaluating performance indicators,&#13;
such as hospital activity, and efficiency indicators of all hospitals available in the district. However,&#13;
some analysis related to diseases surveillance will also be conducted by the HMIS staff. A software&#13;
package will be available at this level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Management&#13;
22.    In implementing HMIS, each state will have its own structure arrangement as shown in Charts&#13;
2 to 6 of Annex 8. The structure will consist of two layers, district level and state level. Punjab and&#13;
West Bengal will have special directors responsible for the HMIS, while in Karnataka HMIS will be a&#13;
part of the Hospital Directorate. The following paragraphs will explain specific arrangement for each&#13;
state.&#13;
23.    Karnataka. At the district level, HMIS will be under the mar.agement of the District Surgeon.&#13;
The District Surgeon will have several responsibilities that are project related, including monitoring the&#13;
referral system, planning and monitoring training activities, and surveillance of communicable disease.&#13;
At the state level, a Deputy Director will be appointed to manage the state HMIS unit. This unit will&#13;
maintain performance indicators of 202 hospitals included in the project. The Deputy Director will&#13;
report directly to the Joint Director of Hospitals.&#13;
24.    Puniab. An Assistant District Coordinator, Training, will be appointed at the district level to&#13;
administer several activities, including HMIS, training and medical records. He or she will report&#13;
directly to the District Coordinator as shown in Chart 5 of Annex 8. At the state level, there will be a&#13;
special director, Director ME and HMIS, who will be responsible for the monitoring, evaluation and&#13;
information system.&#13;
25.    West Bengal. At the district level, HMIS will be placed under the Assistant Project Officer for&#13;
Administration. This officer will coordinate several project activities including the improvement of&#13;
HMIS, surveillance, referral system, and waste management. At the state level, an Additional Director&#13;
HMIS &amp; IEC will be responsible for the development of HMIS in the whole state.&#13;

INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION STRATEGY&#13;
1.    The information, education and communications (IEC) component of the proposed&#13;
project will serve as a vital link between the various activities of the project, such as the&#13;
referral mechanism, the tribal strategy, the gender component, and the beneficiaries of the&#13;
project.  Specifically, the objectives of quality improvement and increased accessibility to&#13;
health care services require an enhanced level of knowledge and awareness amongst the&#13;
beneficiaries which can be facilitated by a well-designed and effectively implemented JEC&#13;
component. The IEC strategy, including target groups to be addressed, key messages to be&#13;
transmitted to each group, and media to be utilized, has been fine-tuned on the basis of the data&#13;
obtained from the Beneficiary Assessment studies undertaken in each state. An assessment has&#13;
also been made of the manpower and other resources required to implement the strategy, and&#13;
the administrative and management arrangements within the DOHFW and PHSC which will be&#13;
utilized to coordinate the development and implementation of the IEC strategy. The linkages&#13;
between the IEC component and other project components which will be addressed directly by&#13;
IEC, such as the referral mechanism surveillance system, the quality assurance program and&#13;
the tribal strategy, have been clarified.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.    Improving Access to Health Services. Access to health services is dependent not only on&#13;
physical distance and cost factors, but also on the levels of awareness and confidence that exist in&#13;
the minds of the beneficiaries -- particularly Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) and other&#13;
disadvantaged groups - with regard to the quality of services provided by the health care facility&#13;
and its staff. An important dimension of this is the sense of "care, courtesy and comfort" that&#13;
patients perceive throughout their interaction with the health care system.  Enhancing the&#13;
Willingness of beneficiaries to seek health care in a timely manner would bc an important objective&#13;
of the project.&#13;
3.    Lmproving Svstem Performance and the Oualitv of Services. The provision of additional&#13;
facilities, equipment and clinical as well as technical training is expected to result in a significant&#13;
improvement in the quality of service delivery. In this context, the IEC strategy will interact&#13;
closely with some of the key components of the proposed project to enhance their efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness. For example, IEC will be used to disseminate information on the functioning of the&#13;
referral mechanism to be strengthened under the project, and reduce wastage of time and resources&#13;
by directing patients to the appropriate level of care. The IEC component will also form linkages&#13;
with the surveillance system and HMIS which will be put in place under the project. This will give&#13;
the IEC agency access to vital information regarding the prevalence of communicable diseases and&#13;
other vital information in the states. Such information can be utilized to target IEC messages more&#13;
effectively. The IEC strategy will also take into account the objectives outlined by the tribal&#13;
strategies for health in Karnataka and West Bengal. It will be ensured that the design of the IEC&#13;
component assists in achieving the objectives of the tribal strategy.&#13;
4.    Improving Efficiency in the Allocation and Use of Health Resources. Since resources are&#13;
currently being used to provide free services to some people who can contribute to the costs,&#13;
allocative efficiency will be improved by increasing the health system's capacity to recover a part&#13;
of these costs. However, willingness to pay is a function not merely of ability to pay but also an&#13;
assessment of what is being paid for. The communications strategy would contribute to allocative&#13;
efficiency by raising the willingness of specific groups to pay user charges for selected services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148                               Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Communications Strategy&#13;
5.     Six broad strategies are proposed for the component: (a) increase awareness of the&#13;
services provided by first referral hospitals, particularly among lower income and&#13;
disadvantaged groups (such as tribals), and thereby increase utilization of the system;&#13;
(b) improve access to the expanded range of all reproductive health services among women;&#13;
(c) motivate all hospital staff to maintain good standards of patient care in terms of "care,&#13;
courtesy and comfort" so that the quality of services received by patients is enhanced;&#13;
(d) sensitize hospital staff to hospital equipment maintenance issues; (e) promote hospital&#13;
services to specific groups in a manner that increases their willingness to utilize these services&#13;
and, where possible, to share in the costs of service delivery; and (f) address specific public&#13;
health issues in each state such as road safety, alcohol abuse, healthy diet (particularly in&#13;
Punjab), women's issues etc.&#13;
6.     The strategy has been developed on the basis of decisions made with regard to:&#13;
(a) identification of target groups; (b) selection of messages; and (c) selection of media. The&#13;
rationale for each of these categories is as follows:&#13;
7.     Target Groups. Five groups will be included in the target audience. First government&#13;
functionaries working at the grass roots level -- anganwadi workers, gram sevikas, school teachers,&#13;
agricultural extension workers and multipurpose health workers -- would be targeted for&#13;
inforrnation pertaining to the availability of different types of health care at different levels within&#13;
the health care system. These workers are likely to be seen as opinion leaders by the populations&#13;
they serve and they can be key information sources in spreading knowledge about the availability&#13;
of services and the referral system. Second women would be considered as a priority target, since&#13;
their access to health facilities is comparatively low. They are, in addition, managers of the health&#13;
status of the household and have demonstrated their ability as a group to mobilize the community.&#13;
Third, patients who enter the hospital system would be considered a priority target. Their word-of-&#13;
mouth based on their first-hand experience will carry far more weight than any other channel of&#13;
communication. The imperative of creating satisfied customers, and thereby expanding the demnand&#13;
for services, particularly in tribal areas, must be recognized for the communication strategy to&#13;
succeed. Fourth, private practitioners and NGOs would be targeted because of their potential role&#13;
in referring patients, and because they should be aware of the improved standards of care in first&#13;
referral hospitals. Eifth, the population in the Sunderban Area of West Bengal and SC/ST groups&#13;
in Karnataka will be targeted, to raise awareness in those communities of the increased access to&#13;
and improved quality of primary health care services now available to them.&#13;
8.     Messages. The content of the messages that comprise the IEC strategy will vary based on&#13;
factors such as geography, seasonality and local considerations. For example, in Punjab, where&#13;
the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular disease and cancer is&#13;
particularly high, IEC will focus on prevention and treatment of such diseases; in Karnataka,&#13;
where there is a relatively high incidence of traffic accidents, lEC will focus on issues of road&#13;
safety as well as the availability of emergency facilities at first referral hospitals. In Karnataka&#13;
and West Bengal, where tribal populations are significant project beneficiaries, IEC will focus on&#13;
disseminating information to tribal groups about service availability, timing of OPD and other&#13;
facilities, user charges and the referral mechanism.&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 3&#13;
9.     Media Selection. Media selection would depend upon the outreach of different media to the&#13;
various target groups. One of the most important media for the IEC strategy is the employees of&#13;
the health care institutions. The manner in which they treat outpatients, inpatients and visitors will&#13;
have the greatest impact of all the possible channels that may be employed. It will, therefore, be&#13;
essential to provide training on communication and education to staff on patient and visitor&#13;
handling. Training modules are being developed for this purpose. Further, training inputs will be&#13;
sustained and supplemented through periodic internal "campaigns" to remind employees of their&#13;
role in delivering quality health care. For the potential beneficiaries, the priority medium would be&#13;
functionaries working in health and related sectors, who will be given in-house tours to enable them&#13;
to understand the changes that have been instituted within the hospitals. Such tours would also be&#13;
arranged for the elected Gram Panchayat and Zilla Panchayat representatives. The IEC strategy&#13;
would also focus on periodic waves of printed communication to higher levels in the Health&#13;
Department and in hospitals. Finally, the use of well-designed signs within hospitals, as well as in&#13;
PHCs, providing information on what services are available and where, would be used as an&#13;
efficient and low-cost medium.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
10.   There is a full-fledged IEC wing functioning within the Health Department of each state.&#13;
However, they have been focusing on Family Welfare and MCH related activities. There is also a&#13;
Health Education wing functioning under the Health Department. This wing will provide support&#13;
to the IEC wing in the development and implementation of the IEC strategy. In addition,&#13;
professional communications agencies will also be used on a contractual basis to develop IEC&#13;
materials and will coordinate their activities with an official designated by the IEC wing to the&#13;
project.&#13;
I.    In Kamataka, the IEC strategy will be coordinated by the Deputy Director (Hospitals&#13;
North) and Deputy Director (Hospitals South) at the state level. At the district level, the Mass&#13;
Media officer would be in charge of disseminating IEC material and would report to the District&#13;
Surgeon, who serves as the coordinator of all project activities at the district level.&#13;
12.   In Punjab. a new post of Deputy Director, IEC (mass media) has been created at the state&#13;
level. This officer would work under the Director M&amp;E and HMIS. The Mass Media Officer at&#13;
the district level would be responsible for dissemination of IEC material in a particular district, and&#13;
would report to the Deputy Medical Commissioner.&#13;
13.   In West Bengal at the state level, IEC is the responsibility of the Additional Director,&#13;
HMIS and IEC, who would report directly to the Project Director. At the district level, the Mass&#13;
Media Officer would be responsible for IEC activities in a particular district, and would report to&#13;
the District Project Officer, who would coordinate all project activities at the district level.&#13;
Timing&#13;
14.   It is proposed that communication activities will be commenced in a phased manner. Some&#13;
aspects of the IEC strategy, such as the public health and gender components, would begin early in&#13;
project implementation. More project specific aspects will be implemented after enhancement of&#13;
physical premises, equipment upgradation and manpower development steps have been completed&#13;
since prematurely initiated IEC activities can be counter-productive.&#13;

TRIBAL AND UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS STRATEGY&#13;
1.     Introduction.  In both Karnataka, with a 3.3%  Scheduled Tribe population, and West&#13;
Bengal, with a 5.9% Scheduled Tribe population, tribal peoples would be substantial beneficiaries&#13;
of the proposed project. Punjab does not have a tribal population. During project preparation, a&#13;
number of workshops were held to facilitate stakeholder identification of health care problems in&#13;
rural as well as tribal areas as well as to develop, through a process of consultation, an appropriate&#13;
tribal strategy for Karnataka and West Bengal.  In addition, Beneficiary Assessment studies,&#13;
involving the informed participation of tribal groups, have been undertaken in tribal and rural areas&#13;
of Karnataka and West Bengal and have: (i) provided a social context analysis for establishing the&#13;
current distribution of and access to health care facilities in rural and tribal areas; (ii) provided an&#13;
institutional analysis to understanding the supply factors which adversely affect health care&#13;
utilization; and (iii) assessed the perception and attitudes related to health needs and health seeking&#13;
behavior of tribal populations (see Annex 17 -- Social Assessment).&#13;
2.     Health Awareness and Related Behavior Among Tribal Populations. An important finding of&#13;
the study is the low hospital utilization rates of the tribal and rural population in both Karnataka and&#13;
West Bengal. The study also focused on the following issues in the two states:&#13;
*  Physical Access. Clearly, hospital services provided by the Government are inadequate in rural&#13;
areas. Distance traveled to reach first referral hospitals seems to be an important factor in&#13;
determining utilization. Community hospitals in tribal areas are located very far from tribal&#13;
hamlets, with poor transportation and communication facilities, and often with no convenient&#13;
residential arrangements for the medical personnel.  Non-availability of staff, particularly&#13;
doctors, is stated to be the most important reason for preferring private medical care over&#13;
Government hospitals. In addition, the insensitivity of medical personnel strongly influences&#13;
the commnunity's confidence in them. Especially in emergency situations, the easy accessibility&#13;
and ready availability of quacks or underqualified doctors is a major determining factor of&#13;
community preference for their services. Another important issue is the non-availability of&#13;
necessary drugs and medicines at first referral hospitals, particularly for curative care, which&#13;
has been identified as a major constraint to patient satisfaction. The community, however,&#13;
seems to be willing to pay for the medicines provided by the hospital staff.&#13;
* Social Access. Results from the qualitative survey conducted in the two states indicate that&#13;
tribals have a special set of social beliefs and practices which affect their health seeking&#13;
behavior. "Illness" was perceived as an inability to discharge one's daily duties. Illness was&#13;
reported earlier amongst children than adults. Gender differentials were less conmmon until the&#13;
age of 12, after which it was observed that illness among girls was reported late. An estimated&#13;
30% of tribals still approach the traditional healer first, and go to a hospital only if the&#13;
treatment provided by him is ineffective. Communities seemed to be generally better aware of&#13;
causes responsible for fevers (sunstroke, mosquito bite), diarrhea, dysentery and jaundice&#13;
(polluted water and food). However, chicken pox, measles, leprosy and epilepsy were ascribed&#13;
to supernatural powers. Consequently, more money is spent on rituals and traditional healers&#13;
for the latter diseases. In the case of diarrhea, a doctor is consulted vithin a day or two of onset&#13;
if there is no improvement in the patient's condition, since the cokz.t.lunity is aware that diarrhea&#13;
could be fatal. Children suffering from measles and chicken pox are kept secluded, and a paste&#13;
of neem leaves and turmeric is applied on the body-followed by a bath and rituals. Persons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
151                                Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
suffering from TB and leprosy are isolated since the community perceives them as being&#13;
dangerous to their health.&#13;
* Economic Access. The data show that substantial costs - on fees, drugs, tests and transport -&#13;
are being incurred by tribals and disadvantaged populations possibly because they postpone&#13;
treatment until the problem  has become very acute.  In addition, due to the relative&#13;
inaccessibility of Government health care services, these populations are approaching the&#13;
private sector for their health care needs. However, a majority were of the opinion that,&#13;
although private hospitals offered modern equipment and convenient service, the costs of&#13;
treatment were prohibitive, and few of them could afford to consistently visit a private&#13;
practitioner.  Moreover, it was felt that the private practitioners commitment to low-cost&#13;
preventive care was minimal, and that in the case of emergencies a Government hospital was&#13;
much more likely to provide efficient service.&#13;
3.     Tribal and Underdeveloped Areas Strategy. The project's tribal and underdeveloped areas&#13;
strategy in Kamataka and West Bengal is aimed at increasing the demand for hospital services in tribal&#13;
and underdeveloped areas by improving the quality of services provided; by providing effective IEC to&#13;
better inform tribal populations of the benefits of using health services at secondary hospitals; and by&#13;
providing primary care services at selected sites. The number of beds at sub-divisional and community&#13;
hospitals located in tribal and underdeveloped areas will be increased to reflect a share of beds at&#13;
secondary hospitals that is much more commensurate with their proportion in the overall population of&#13;
the states. In addition to increasing the bed strength in tribal and underdeveloped area hospitals, the&#13;
project would: (a) strengthen linkages between primary and secondary health care services; (b) provide&#13;
an incentive package to doctors and other medical staff in tribal and underdeveloped areas to encourage&#13;
them to accept assignment in these areas; (c) incrcase the appropriate utilization of non-tribal medical&#13;
systems by the tribal population; and (d) reduce the cost to tribals and disadvantaged populations of&#13;
utilizing the system.&#13;
4.     Specific project components have been developed in both Karnataka and West Bengal on the&#13;
basis of this infornation, and these are described below.&#13;
West Bengal&#13;
5.     Of the total West Bengal population of 68 million (1991), 3.8 million or 5.9%  are STs. 5&#13;
large ST conmnunities - Santhals, Oraon, Munda, Bhumij, and Kora - constitute 84% of the state's&#13;
ST population. There are 35 other smaller groups of tribals dispersed across the state, of whom 3&#13;
have been designated as primitive tribal communities.&#13;
6.     The Government of West Bengal has had a Tribal Welfare Department looking into the&#13;
special needs of tribal peoples since 1952.  This department was subsequently renamed the&#13;
Scheduled Castes and Tribes Welfare Department in 1967, and has initiated and implemented&#13;
several programs in education, including grants and scholarships; construction of schools and&#13;
hostels; provision of books, clothing and mid-day meals; economic upliftment, including&#13;
development of land and irrigation facilities, supply of seeds and fertilizer, soil conservation, and&#13;
cottage industries; social sectors, including provision of medical facilities, drinking water supply,&#13;
houses and house-sites, legal aid, and provision of grants-in-aid for voluntary agencies working&#13;
with tribal peoples.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
152                                 Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
7.     Access to Health Services in Tribal Areas. According to GOI service delivery norms for&#13;
tribal areas, a sub-center is to be provided for every 3,000 population and a PHC for every 20,000&#13;
population, as against a norm of a sub-center for every 5,000 population and a PHC for every&#13;
30,000 population in other rural areas. There are now 303 sub-centers, 47 PHCs and 28 rural&#13;
hospitals located in the tribal areas of the state. The Government plans to set up additional sub-&#13;
centers and PHCs to bring their numbers up to the population norms.&#13;
8.     Services provided in these health facilities include disease control, such as malaria, filaria,&#13;
tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, Japanese encephalitis and kala-azar; other preventive programs;&#13;
maternal and child health programs; and ayurvedic and homeopathic treatments.&#13;
9.     Proposed Strategy for ImRrovine Access to Ouality Health Care. The following are the&#13;
project activities in support of the tribal strategy described in para. 3:&#13;
* strengthening health care delivery in tribal areas. A large section of tribal and disadvantaged&#13;
peoples still depend on traditional healers, or sometimes the local quack, since they do not have&#13;
adequate access to public health services and cannot afford a qualified private doctor. In order&#13;
to address this issue, under the Sunderban plan, all 28 rural hospitals located in underdeveloped&#13;
areas will be strengthened under the project. In addition, 17 hospitals located in areas with a&#13;
sizable tribal population will also be strengthened (see Annex 19).&#13;
*  strengthening linkages between priinary and first referral health care services. The available&#13;
evidence points to the urgent need to strengthen linkages between primary and first referral&#13;
levels of health care, particularly with respect to the referral of tribal and disadvantaged&#13;
patients. Special efforts would be made to disseminate referral administrative guidelines and&#13;
referral protocols to primary health centers in these areas. The Zilla Parishad would also&#13;
construct rest-houses close to the first referral hospitals for the convenience of patients and their&#13;
families who have been referred to hospitals far from home, requiring an overnight stay.&#13;
Transport would also be provided free of charge from the referring facility to those patients&#13;
who cannot afford the cost of public transport.&#13;
*  increasing incentives for medical staff in tribal and underdeveloped areas.  Staff would be&#13;
provided incentives to increase their commitment to serving in tribal and underdeveloped areas&#13;
in a variety of ways. Additional staff quarters will be provided to all grades of staff with the&#13;
construction of new staff quarters in tribal areas. Other benefits, such as extra credit to doctors&#13;
and other staff for PG qualification admission and for fellowships; enhanced opportunities for&#13;
transfer to urban areas after serving in a tribal area for 4-5 years; and preference to the children&#13;
of doctors in tribal areas for admission in Government-run schools. This would encourage&#13;
doctors and staff to work in tribal and underdeveloped areas and provide quality services. This,&#13;
in turn, will increase the credibility of the health care system for tribal and disadvantaged&#13;
patients and encourage them to approach health care facilities more readily, when necessary.&#13;
*  increasing the appropriate utilization of the government health services delivery network by&#13;
tribal and disadvantaged populations. An important intervention aimed at encouraging the&#13;
health seeking behavior of tribal and disadvantaged populations is an IEC program targeted&#13;
particularly at increasing their awareness of disease. The IEC program would also increase the&#13;
awareness and sensitivity of medical staff to tribal customs and culture, as 1 means to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 5&#13;
improving the client-provider relationship in tribal areas and promoting the level of comfort that&#13;
tribal peoples feel in the health facility.&#13;
reducing the cost to tribals and disadvantaged populations of utilizing the first referral health&#13;
care system.  The analysis clearly shows that the poor, including tribals, are bearing a&#13;
disproportionate burden of health care costs (see Annex 17) and they will be exempted from&#13;
user charges, particularly for drugs and tests, which constitute the major share of expenditures&#13;
incurred at Government health facilities (see Annexes 5 and 17). The rest houses to be provided&#13;
by the Zilla Parishad, mentioned earlier, will also contribute in the reduction of the cost&#13;
burden. In addition, the Government will coordinate with NGOs, where possible, to provide&#13;
transportation and/or food to needy patients and attendants.&#13;
Karnataka&#13;
10.   The ST population in Karnataka is about 2 million or about 3.3% of the state's population.&#13;
They are geographically dispersed across the state, and are not a homogenous population. Some ST&#13;
households who live in the plains are quite modern and well integrated with the rest of the&#13;
population. Such households have considerably improved their economic and social position.&#13;
However, other STs are primitive tribes, many of them hill and forest dwellers. The health&#13;
indicators amongst this latter group tend to be very poor, due to their isolation and poverty.&#13;
11.    An overall assessment clearly indicates that there is need for special targeted interventions&#13;
for the STs. Within these communities, there is a special need to improve access to and quality of&#13;
health care delivery for women.&#13;
12.    Proposed Strategy for Improving Access to Quality Health Care.   The tribal and&#13;
underdeveloped areas strategy to be implemented in Karnataka will include components similar to&#13;
the ones proposed in West Bengal. In addition, the Government of Karnataka proposes to&#13;
implement a well-designed program of primary care interventions to improve the availability of&#13;
health services for SC/ST households residing in rural areas.  A major activity planned in this&#13;
context would be a system of annual health check-ups for all SC/ST families, which would include:&#13;
(a) physical examination, including pulse, B.P., eyes, ears, nose, teeth, tongue, skin disorders,&#13;
disabilities etc.; (b) systemic examinations, including cardiovascular, respiratory etc.; (c) simple&#13;
laboratory investigations; and (d) special examination of women, including pelvic examination and&#13;
FW services. A record of the health check-up would be maintained in a master register and each&#13;
individual would be issued a health check-up card free of cost.&#13;
13.   Implementation Plan. The state has a large network of 7,793 Auxiliary Nurse Midwife&#13;
(ANM) sub-centers which on average cater to a population of about 3,000 persons, of which about&#13;
40 would be tribals. The medical check-up will be scheduled in Health Check-up Camps to be&#13;
organized in the ANM sub-centers according to a timetable to be drawn up by the District Health&#13;
and Family Welfare officer. A team of medical professionals consisting of the Medical Officer of&#13;
the Primary Health Center (PHC); Lady Medical Officer specially drafted for this purpose from a&#13;
Government hospital; laboratory technician; Lady Health Visitor; ANM; and one para-medical staff&#13;
would then visit the sub-center on the scheduled date. The team would carry with it such&#13;
equipment and other materials as are required for a thorough medical check-up. Doctors and other&#13;
staff would utilize the PHC vehicle where feasible. Where such a vehicle is not available, a vehicle&#13;
will be hired for transporting staff and equipment to the camps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
154                                 Annex 13&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
14.   Referral. Cases requiring further treatment would be referred to the nearest Government&#13;
hospital where appropriate facilities are available. A referral card would be issued to the patients,&#13;
and such patients would get free treatment at referral hospitals where necessary.&#13;
15.   Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign. Prior to the date on which&#13;
the health check-up is scheduled in a particular village, the ANM and male health worker would&#13;
make house to house contact with each SC/ST household and provide information regarding the&#13;
venue, timing and purpose of the health check-up. A particular target for IEC activities would be&#13;
women, since they are less likely to avail themselves of the facility provided. This would e..sure&#13;
that the maximum number of households attend the camp. The camps would also be a good venue&#13;
for IEC activities relating to the dJs.emination of general public health issues.&#13;
16.   Drugs and Medicines.  Based on an average of Rs. 10 per person towards drugs and&#13;
medicines to be dispensed at the time of the check-up, an amount of Rs. 500 will be allotted for this&#13;
purpose to each camp.&#13;
17.   Lady Medical Officers (LMOs). In some districts, particularly in the Hyderabad - Karnataka&#13;
region, adequate numbers of LMOs are not available in the Government sector.  Given the&#13;
importance of the LMO in encouraging women in SC/ST communities to seek health services at the&#13;
camps, the services of available lady doctors in the district hospital would be utilized for the check-&#13;
up. In some cases, the services of private lady doctors available at the district and sub-divisional&#13;
levels will be utilized, with the payment of an honorarium of Rs. 300.&#13;
18.    Pilot Introduction of the Scheme. It is proposed to introduce this scheme in the 5 districts&#13;
of Mysore, Hassan, Kolar, Bijapur and Raichur during the first year of the project. It would&#13;
subsequently be extended to the districts of Belgaum, Chitradurga, Dakshina Kannada, Gulbarga&#13;
and Bellary.  Before extending the scheme to the next set of districts, an impact analysis of the&#13;
scheme on the access of SC/ST families to health care delivery, and on the improvement of their&#13;
health status would be conducted.&#13;
19.   Monitoring and Supervision.  The PHC Medical Officer will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the scheme. The work done by the PHC MO will be monitored by the newly&#13;
designated Taluk Level Medical Officers. A District Level Committee will be constituted with the&#13;
CEO, Zilla Panchayat as Chairman. The composition of the Committee will be as follows:&#13;
Chairman: CEO, Zilla Panchayat; Members: District Surgeon; Principal of the local medical&#13;
college; District Information Publicity Officer; Representatives of 2 voluntary organizations;&#13;
Assistant Director, Women and Child Development; and District Health and FW Officer.&#13;
20.    The Committee would: (a) review progress of the scheme on a monthly basis; (b) arrange&#13;
wide publicity for the camps; (c) secure full involvement of voluntary organizations; and&#13;
(d) approve expenditure incurred. A monthly progress report would be sent to the Joint Director&#13;
(Planning), who would be responsible for monitoring and reviewing the scheme at the state level.&#13;

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    Background and Obiectives. Between February, 1995 and October, 1995, a number of&#13;
studies were conducted as part of project preparation in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal.&#13;
These studies collectively comprise the Social Assessment (SA), and include the Beneficiary&#13;
Assessment and the Review of the Private Sector. The SA was undertaken in an environment of&#13;
intense collaboration between the World Bank team; local research organizations including the&#13;
Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), the Foundation for Research on Underprivileged&#13;
Groups (FRUG), and Operations Research Group (ORG); the respective state Governments; local&#13;
Government; and representatives of NGOs and the private sector.&#13;
2.     Components. The SA had four components: (i) a social context and institutional analysis,&#13;
identifying and selecting specific areas within each state that are geographically, socially and&#13;
culturally distinctive, differentiating between rural and urban areas, and describing and analyzing&#13;
the organizational and legal framework of the health care network in the state; (ii) an analysis of&#13;
health needs, including an analysis of service utilization of both private and Government health&#13;
services differentiated by income level, gender and social grouping (Scheduled Caste/Scheduled&#13;
Tribe), and an analysis of the access and coverage of both traditional and allopathic systems of&#13;
medicine in the more remote areas of the state, especially for more disadvantaged and tribal&#13;
groups; (iii) an assessment of health seeking behavior amongst women and tribal populations; and&#13;
(iv) a review of the role played by the private sector in health care provision, including the scope of&#13;
the private sector, the role of NGOs, and the opportunities for contracting-out support services to&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
3.     Stakeholder Participation. An important aspcct of the SA was thc involvement of key&#13;
stakeholders. Preparation of the project devoted special attention to facilitating a sense of&#13;
owncrship and commitment of those involved in the process. They included: (i) the Government of&#13;
India (GOI), state Governments and agencies responsiblc for project implementation; (ii) the&#13;
beneficiaries, i.e., the individuals, groups and communities who would benefit from the proposed&#13;
intervention; (iii) wvomen, scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST); and (iv) others with a&#13;
vested interest in development initiatives, including other donor agencies, NGOs, religious and&#13;
community organizations, local authorities and the private sector.&#13;
4.     A number of participatory activities were incorporated into project design:&#13;
*  three preparation workshops, organized by GOI, involving central and state Govemment&#13;
officials, including the Health Secretaries of 11 participating states; representatives from&#13;
WHO; the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; the Gujarat Institute of&#13;
Development Research; ASCI; the Indian Institute of Health Management and Research; the&#13;
All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health; and the IDA team were held in Hyderabad in&#13;
November, 1994, in Jaipur in February, 1995, and in Shimla in June 1995, in which the group&#13;
discussed health sector issues with regard to financing and implementation and agreed on a&#13;
strategy for future activities;&#13;
*  beneficiary assessments were conducted in each state, with Terms of Reference agreed with&#13;
IDA, to determine the level of service availability; undertake a social context analysis of the&#13;
geographically, socially and culturally distinctive features of each state; undertake an&#13;
institutional analysis to understand the supply factors influencing health care utilization;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
156                               Annex 14&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
determine the health needs of communities, particularly women and SC/ST populations; study&#13;
the social, physical and economic constraints to access to health care; and estimate the private&#13;
costs of seeking treatment;&#13;
*  private health sector studies were also conducted in each state, with the intensive participation&#13;
of private medical professionals, to understand the scope of private sector involvement in&#13;
health care delivery; the role of NGOs in the health sector; the coverage and cost of alternative&#13;
systems of medicine; the potential for contracting-out services, particularly support services, to&#13;
the private sector by the Government; and the current level of regulation and monitoring of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
*  technical norms workshops were held in Bangalore, Chandigarh, and Calcutta to develop and&#13;
reach a consensus on service norms for the different tiers of the health system viz, the&#13;
community, sub-divisional and district level hospitals. Participants included officials from the&#13;
Directorates of Health of the respective states, private medical practitioners, members of the&#13;
academic community, the project preparation teams and members of the IDA mission.&#13;
Subsequently, training workshops were held in Karnataka and West Bengal involving state&#13;
medical officials, academics, and private practitioners, to determine the training needs for&#13;
medical personnel from different disciplines functioning in different tiers of the health system;&#13;
* the participation of local NGOs was encouraged in all states. In Karnataka, for instance, an&#13;
NGO functioning in the tribal areas of southern Karnataka participated in discussions between&#13;
the Government of Karnataka and the IDA mission. In West Bcngal, the IDA team discussed&#13;
the scope of NGO work with the Tagore Society in the Sunderban area. Similar discussions&#13;
were held in Punjab. Useful suggestions were made in all cases with regard to health care&#13;
delivery for underprivileged groups.&#13;
5.     Methodology. The studics were designed to provide answers to a scrics of questions which&#13;
would enable the project preparation team to fine-tune the proposal to bcst scrve the felt health care&#13;
needs at the community level. Some of these questions were: Who are the stakeholders? Are the&#13;
objectives of the project consistent with their needs, interests and capacities? What social and&#13;
cultural factors affect the ability of stakeholders to participate or benefit from the intervention&#13;
proposed? What will be the impact of the project on women and vulnerable groups? What are the&#13;
social risks which might affect the success of the project? What institutional and management&#13;
arrangements are needed for participation, and is there a plan for building capacity at the&#13;
appropriate levels?&#13;
6.     A multi-pronged strategy was adopted to gather the information required for the SA. The&#13;
basic demographic, epidemiological and socio-economic data were gathered from  secondary&#13;
sources. These included the Statistical Abstract and Medical Directory of each state for data&#13;
regarding the availability of medical services, utilization of services and other hospital-based data;&#13;
National Sample Survey (NSSO) 42nd. round for discussions on rural-urban differentials in health&#13;
facilities, public-private health facilities, paying-non-paying wards and cost differentials;&#13;
Household Survey of Health Care Utilization and Expenditure (NCAER, 1995) for an&#13;
understanding of the morbidity pattern at the state level and health care utilization and expenditure;&#13;
and secondary information from selected health facilities on the availability of scrvices, drugs and&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
157                               Annex 14&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
7.     Primary data consisted of quantitative data regarding the supply factors affecting health&#13;
service delivery, linkages between traditional and allopathic medicine, physical, social and&#13;
economic factors affecting utilization of health services, and cost of treatment; and qualitative data&#13;
regarding the relationship between health, nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene, social services&#13;
currently being offered by the Government/NGOs, health needs of the community, perception and&#13;
attitudes related to health seeking behavior, gender differentials in health seeking behavior, and the&#13;
cost of seeking treatment. The primary data was generated in a variety of ways: through&#13;
participatory observation, interviews, case studies, focus group discussions and rapid rural&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
8. Health Status in the Three States&#13;
* Kamataka. The population of Karnataka in 1991 was about 45 million, with urban areas&#13;
accounting for about 31 percent of the population. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes&#13;
formed 16.4 and 4.0 percent respectively of the population. 40% of the population is below the&#13;
poverty line compared to about 33% for India as a whole.&#13;
-  In Kamataka, the birth rate of 26.3, death rate of 8 and infant mortality rate of 67 per&#13;
thousand live births compares to the national averages of 29.3, 9.8 and 80 per thousand live&#13;
births respectively. Howevcr, neonatal and post natal mortality and still birth rates have&#13;
increased during the late 80's and early 90's. In the last decade, the number of patients&#13;
admnitted in government hospitals has increased by 60 percent, putting a great deal of pressure&#13;
on hospital facilities. During the period 1982-92, the increase in inpatients has been greatest&#13;
for the treatment of infectious diseases, neoplasm, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic&#13;
diseases and immunity disorders, complications due to pregnancy and puerperium, and injuries&#13;
and poisoning.&#13;
*  West Bengal. With a total population of 68 million, Wcst Bengal is the most densely&#13;
populated state in India (about 770 per square kilometcr). 39% of the population is below 15&#13;
years of age, and only 27.5% is urban. Thc largc rural population is mainly agricultural, with a&#13;
predominance of small and marginal farmers. It is cstimated that more than 30% of the rural&#13;
population lives below the poverty line. Scheduled Tribes constitute 5.6% of the population&#13;
and 23.6% belong to the Scheduled Caste.&#13;
*  West Bengal has a birth rate of 25.6, death rate of 7.3 and infant mortality rate of 58 per&#13;
thousand live births. The fact that more than 50% of the disease burden is attributable to&#13;
matemal and child health and communicable diseases is good reason for selecting a package of&#13;
interventions at the primary and first referral level that would cost-effectively address the&#13;
major health care needs in the state.&#13;
*  Punjab. twenty-nine percent of the population of Punjab lives in urban areas. The sex ratio of&#13;
882 females per thousand males as against the national average of 927 females per thousand&#13;
males, according to the 1991 census, is a matter for gravc concem. In 1991, the per capita&#13;
income was US$554 equivalent, and 12% of the state's population was below the poverty line.&#13;
However, as in other states, there is substantial regional variation in per capita income. The&#13;
Upper Bari Doab area, in the northwest comer of the state, has 40% and Southem Malwa has&#13;
25% of its population below the poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
158                                 Annex 14&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
* Punjab has a birth rate of 27.7, a death rate of 7.8 and an infant mortality rate of 53 per&#13;
thousand live births. In terms of outpatients seen at medical institutions, the Annual&#13;
Dispensary Report also shows that 76 percent of the disease burden is due to non-&#13;
communicable diseases; acute respiratory infection is the other major disease burden at 17&#13;
percent. These figures when compared to other Indian states reflect the health transition&#13;
underway in Punjab. (Details of the epidemiological profile in each state are given in Annex&#13;
1).&#13;
9.     Major Findings. With a few variations between states, the main findings of the SA can be&#13;
sunmmarized as follows:&#13;
10.    Profile of Users of First Referral Hospitals&#13;
*  Demographic Characteristics. Irrespective of the type of hospital, the majority of users&#13;
belonged to the age-group 16-35. Women and children below the age of seven demonstrated a&#13;
clear preference for facilities closer to home and predominantly used the community and sub-&#13;
divisional hospitals, while men were the predominant users of district hospitals.&#13;
e  Socio-economic Characteristics. On average, the distribution of users by caste, literacy level&#13;
and place of residence (urban/rural) are comparable to the average distribution of these&#13;
populations in the state as a whole. However, the proportion of patients who are literate,&#13;
urban residents, and higher caste and income groups tended to increase in higher level&#13;
facilities, indicating that the most disadvantaged and needy sections of society havc limited&#13;
access to district hospitals.&#13;
i  Nature of Ailment. About half the users visitcd the hospital for trcatmcnt of acute mcdical&#13;
conditions such as fevcr, cough, diarrhea etc. A larger proportion of paticnts at the community&#13;
hospital level suffered from acute medical conditions compared to the district hospital level.&#13;
District hospitals were preferred for chronic medical, surgical, obstetric and orthopedic cases;&#13;
while sub-divisional hospitals were used predominantly for injuries.&#13;
*  Distance Traveled. More than two-thirds of respondents resided within a distance of 10 kms.&#13;
of the hospital utilized, and about a third of the respondents were within walking distance. The&#13;
proportion of users within walking distance was highest in primary and community health&#13;
centers, and decreased in higher level hospitals.&#13;
*  Referral Mechanism. Less than 2% of those interviewed at secondary hospitals reported either&#13;
consulting or being referred by the staff at a Primary Health Center, indicating that the referral&#13;
system is functioning very poorly. Two thirds of those interviewed had consulted a private&#13;
medical practitioner, particularly for chronic ailments. A large number had either approached&#13;
the hospital of their own accord, or been advised to do so by relatives.&#13;
11.    Profile of First Referral Hospitals&#13;
* Physical Access. Although, in general, patients are within 10 Kms. of a first referral hospital,&#13;
there are pockets in all the states where physical access is an important issue. The Sunderban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
159                                Annex 14&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
area of West Bengal, for example, consists largely of swamps, tidal estuaries and dense forest.&#13;
Transport and communication networks are inadequate, and riverine transport between the&#13;
network of 54 islands is unreliable. This area poses special challenges in the health sector,&#13;
since cases of snake bite, shark bite, crocodile bite and tiger mauling are not uncommon. In&#13;
addition, the population in the Sunderban consists largely of poor and marginal farmners, 40%&#13;
of whom belong to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC/ST). In the case of Karnataka,&#13;
the northem districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Raichur have historically been neglected&#13;
in terns of health sector development and health indicators tend to be poor in these areas.&#13;
There is a special need to strengthen health care networks in these areas, and to encourage the&#13;
development of the private and NGO sectors to provide outreach services which the public&#13;
health services are unable to provide.&#13;
Social Access. According to hospital sources, the proportion of hospital users belonging to&#13;
SC/ST groups is commensurate with their proportion in the general population. However,&#13;
considering the poor socio-economic condition of these groups, and their low nutritional level,&#13;
the morbidity and mortality in this population is greater and warrants a higher utilization of&#13;
secondary hospital services. An additional issue is the low utilization of health services by&#13;
women. In Karnataka, for example, the NSS survey indicates that the sex ratio among&#13;
hospitalized cases is 786 females per 1,000 males, whereas the sex ratio in the population is&#13;
960 females per 1,000 males. The average household expenditure per illness was found to be&#13;
lower for women and girls as compared to their male counterparts. Given the results of the&#13;
NCAER survey (1993), which reports that the morbidity among females aged 15-59 is 10%&#13;
greater than among men in the same age group, there appears to be a significant bias against&#13;
females in both hospitalization and intra-household allocation of health resources.&#13;
*  Services Available. There are no norms for the provision of services at the different level of&#13;
first referral hospitals (community, sub-divisional and district). Basic specialist services i.e.&#13;
medicinc, surgery, gynecology/obstetrics, and pediatrics arc availablc at all first referral&#13;
institutions. In addition, at district hospitals, other specialist services such as orthopedics,&#13;
ENT, ophthalmology, skin and S.T.D. and blood bank are available. Dcntistry services are&#13;
available at some district level hospitals, but not at others. Hence, there is considerable&#13;
overlap between the first referral hospitals, and inconsistency between different regions within&#13;
each state.&#13;
*  Personnel. While there is not a general shortage of trained medical and para-medical staff,&#13;
there is a shortage of medical personnel in rural and remote areas of all the states. Moreover,&#13;
the absence of certain specialties at sub-divisional and district hospitals was reported&#13;
repeatedly. In Karnataka and Punjab, for example, the presence of a gynecologist at the sub-&#13;
divisional hospital was found to be of special importance. In Punjab, a need was expressed for&#13;
more pediatricians at district hospitals. There is considerable difficulty in placing doctors in&#13;
rural and remote areas in both West Bengal and Punjab.&#13;
*  Maintenance. At present, approximately 2% of the original cost of construction is allocated&#13;
annually towards the maintenance of the hospitals in each of the states. This sum is grossly&#13;
inadequate. There are additional problems created by the fact that maintenance of secondary&#13;
hospitals is in the charge of the Public Works Department (PWD) rather than the Health&#13;
Department. Leaking roofs and peeling plaster are atommon sight in most hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
160                                 Annex 14&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
Equipment and Vehicles.  Some of the major equipment at secondary hospitals is non-&#13;
functional. A shortage of well trained technicians was reported to be a significant problem.&#13;
There is also a lack of regional workshops at the district level, which could expedite equipment&#13;
and vehicle repair and maintenance.  In the absence of such subsidiary workshops, all&#13;
maintenance jobs need to be handled at the central level, leading to overload and delays.&#13;
* Laboratory Services. Only basic laboratory services are available even at the district hospital&#13;
level, due to shortages in reagents, antigens and other equipment.  At sub-district level&#13;
hospitals, laboratories are under-equipped and laboratory technician posts are vacant, with the&#13;
result that the laboratories are non-functional. In Karnataka and Punjab, there is no provision&#13;
for the post of pathologist in any of the hospitals.&#13;
* Training. Most in-service training programs are oriented towards on-going national programs,&#13;
such as CSSM, UIP and Blindness Control. No in-service training is offered to update the&#13;
clinical skills of medical and para-medical personnel on a regular basis, except in West Bengal&#13;
where a training program for doctors at district hospitals is in place. Hospital administrators&#13;
also reported a need for training in managerial skills to better fulfill their duties.&#13;
12.    Health Awareness and Related Behavior Amone Tribal and Disadvantaged Populations:&#13;
This component of the SA deals specifically with health seeking behavior among tribal and&#13;
disadvantaged populations in Karnataka and West Bengal. Punjab has no tribal population. An&#13;
important finding of the study is the low hospital utilization rates of the tribal population.&#13;
* Physical Access. Clearly, hospital services provided by the Government arc inadequate in&#13;
rural areas. Distance traveled to reach first referral hospitals seems to be an important factor&#13;
in determining utilization. Community hospitals in tribal and underdeveloped areas are located&#13;
very far from the village, with poor transportation and commnunication facilities, and often with&#13;
no convenient residential arrangements for the medical personncl. Non-availability of staff,&#13;
particularly doctors, is stated to be the most important reason for preferring private medical&#13;
care over Government hospitals. In tribal areas, the insensitivity of medical personnel strongly&#13;
influences the community's confidence in them. Especially in emergency situations, the easy&#13;
accessibility and ready availability of quacks or underqualified doctors is a major determining&#13;
factor of community preference for their services.  Another important issue is the non-&#13;
availability of necessary drugs and medicines at first referral hospitals, particularly for&#13;
curative care, which has been identified as a major constraint to patient satisfaction. The&#13;
community, however, seems to be willing to pay for the medicines provided by the hospital&#13;
staff.&#13;
* Social Access. Results from the qualitative survey conducted in the two states indicate that&#13;
tribals have a special set of social beliefs and practices which affect their health seeking&#13;
behavior. "Illness" was perceived as an inability to discharge one's daily duties. Illness was&#13;
reported earlier amongst children than adults. Gender differentials were less common until the&#13;
age of 12, after which it was observed that illness among girls was reported late. An estimated&#13;
30% of tribals still approach the traditional healer first, and go to a hospital only if the&#13;
treatment provided by him is ineffective. Communities seemed to be generally better aware of&#13;
causes responsible for fevers (sunstroke, mosquito bite), diarrhea, dysentery and jaundice&#13;
(polluted water and food). However, chicken pox, mtasles, leprosy and epilepsy were ascribed&#13;
to supernatural powers. Consequently, more money is spent on rituals and traditional healers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
161                                  Annex 14&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
for the latter diseases. In the case of diarrhea, a doctor is consulted within a day or two of&#13;
onset if there is no improvement in the patient's condition, since the community is aware that&#13;
diarrhea could be fatal. Children suffering from measles and chicken pox are kept secluded,&#13;
and a paste of neem leaves and turmeric is applied on the body followed by a bath and rituals.&#13;
Persons suffering from TB and leprosy are isolated since the community perceives them as&#13;
being dangerous to their health.&#13;
* Economic Access. The data show that substantial costs -- on fees, drugs, tests and transport -&#13;
are being incurred by tribals and disadvantaged populations possibly because they postpone&#13;
treatment until the problem  has become very acute.  In addition, due to the relative&#13;
inaccessibility of Government health care services, tribal populations are approaching the&#13;
private sector for their health care needs. However, a majority were of the opinion that,&#13;
although private hospitals offered modern equipment and convenient service, the costs of&#13;
treatment were prohibitive, and few of them could afford to consistently visit a private&#13;
practitioner. Moreover, it was felt that the private practitioners commitment to low-cost&#13;
preventive care was minimal, and that in the case of emergencies a Government hospital was&#13;
much more likely to provide efficient service.&#13;
13.    Causes for the Under-Utilization of First Referral Hospitals&#13;
* Shortage of Staff. Non-availability of staff, particularly doctors, is stated to be the most&#13;
important reason for preferring private medical care over Government hospitals. Most&#13;
laboratory technician and supervisory cadre posts arc either vacant, or the posted persons are&#13;
on prolonged dcputation at the district headquarters. In tribal areas, the insensitivity of&#13;
medical personnel strongly influenced the community's confidence in them.  Especially in&#13;
emergency situations, the easy accessibility and ready availability of quacks or underqualified&#13;
doctors is a major determining factor of community prefercnce for their scrvices.&#13;
- Shortage of Medicines. Non-availability of necessary drugs and mcdicines at first referral&#13;
hospitals, particularly for curative care, is identified as a major constraint to patient&#13;
satisfaction. The community, however, seems to be willing to pay for the medicines provided&#13;
by the hospital staff.&#13;
* Poor Access. Accessibility of first referral hospitals seemed to be an important factor in&#13;
determining utilization. Some district hospitals are located such that they are inaccessible to a&#13;
large proportion of the district's population. In fact, some residents preferred to visit the&#13;
neighboring district hospital, since it was more accessible than their own.  Similarly,&#13;
community hospitals are located in remote areas, with poor transportation and communication&#13;
facilities, and often with no convenient residential arrangements for the medical personnel.&#13;
14.    The Role of the Private Sector:&#13;
m The private sector in health care delivery is unorganized, and is operated by a mix of qualified&#13;
and unqualified practitioners. The private sector is rclatively better developed in Karnataka&#13;
and Punjab, particularly around urban centers, than in West Bengal. Services are provided&#13;
mainly through small clinics and nursing homes. Most privatc practitioncrs dispense allopathic&#13;
medicine, although homeopathy and ayurved are also widespread. Both preventive and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
162                               Annex 14&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
curative services are provided, while emergency and medico-legal cases are generally referred&#13;
to Government first referral hospitals.&#13;
* The main advantage of the private sector health facility is its easy accessibility. Not only are&#13;
private clinics better located in urban areas, there is also the facility of round-the-clock&#13;
availability of a specialist on the premises, unlike in the case of a Government hospital where&#13;
doctors are available only for a fixed number of hours every day. In addition, due to better&#13;
maintenance and sanitation, and more courteous treatment by the medical personnel, private&#13;
hospitals are perceived to be providing better services than Government hospitals.&#13;
* A majority of patients visiting private clinics belong to the middle and upper socio-economic&#13;
classes, since the costs of private treatment are very high when compared to a Government&#13;
hospital. In West Bengal, for example, it was found that, of out-patients visiting a private&#13;
practitioner, 58% spent about Rs. 100, 23.9% spent Rs. 100-300, and 6.9% spent more than&#13;
Rs. 300 on medicines in the preceding three months. By comparison, the figures for those&#13;
visiting a Government hospital are 28.3%, 12% and 5.4% respectively. In other words, only&#13;
about 10% of out-patients are spending less than Rs. 100 in the private sector, as against&#13;
almost 55% of out-patients visiting Government hospitals.&#13;
* Of those belonging to the low-income and tribal groups, a majority were of the opinion that,&#13;
although private hospitals offered modem equipment and convenient service, the costs of&#13;
treatment were prohibitive, and few of them could afford to consistently visit a private&#13;
practitioner. Moreover, it was felt that the private practitioners commitment to low-cost&#13;
preventive care was minimal, and that in the case of emergencies a Government hospital was&#13;
much more likely to provide efficient service.&#13;
Actions Recommended&#13;
15.    The SA has made an important contribution to the overall cffort to assist the states of&#13;
Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal to design a cost-effcctive and sustainable health system. The&#13;
broader sectoral policy reforms such as improvements in health planning capacity, management&#13;
effectiveness, allocation of public resources for health, and enhanced role of the private sector&#13;
Nvould increase the efficiency of the health sector by improving the environment in which the health&#13;
sector operates and by optimizing resource use. The technical and quality improvements, including&#13;
operations and maintenance functions, at the institutional and health facility levels will enhance the&#13;
effectiveness and efficiency of health care services by encouraging patients to seek timely care&#13;
resulting in higher cure rates at lower costs. The strengthening and upgrading of selected aspects of&#13;
the primary health care system for implementing the various priority health programs and provide&#13;
basic health care in rural areas would have a direct impact on improving the health status of the&#13;
people by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability. The SA has contributed to developing the&#13;
following strategies and project design issues:&#13;
16.    Streamlining of Norms.  In order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
functioning of the different levels of the first referral hospital network, to reduce overlap in the&#13;
services provided at such hospitals, and to reduce wastage of resources, technical norms&#13;
workshops were held in each state. The purpose of this workshop was to reach a consensus on&#13;
services that would be provided in the different tiers of the health system viz. the community, sub-&#13;
divisional and district level hospitals. Based on the service norms that were developed in each state,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
163                                 Annex 14&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
the participants subsequently developed staffing and equipment norms, equipment maintenance&#13;
plans, referral system, training needs assessments, and management systems. The implementation&#13;
of these recommendations will help reduce both the duplication of services and wastage of&#13;
resources that characterize health service delivery. Preliminary estimates show that, when&#13;
implemented, this streamlining and rationalization will result in considerable efficiency gains.&#13;
Estimates in Andhra Pradesh have suggested that as much as 33% of cost could be saved by&#13;
treating patients at first referral facilities rather than at tertiary level health facilities.&#13;
17.    Referral System. An adequately functioning referral mechanism  would improve the&#13;
effectiveness of the primary health care level and encourage a greater participation of the private&#13;
sector in health care. In reality, the referral system in these states, as in the rest of India, does not&#13;
function well. The different tiers do not complement each other, the lower tiers are underutilized&#13;
and institutional and technical linkages between the lower and the higher tiers are weak. Moreover,&#13;
less than 2% of the patients at first referral facilities are referred from PHCs.&#13;
18.    The project would seek to ensure that a much higher proportion of patients coming to first&#13;
referral hospitals had been seen at a Community/rural hospital and referred upwards. Likewise,&#13;
for those patients going to tertiary hospitals, the project would implement several measures to&#13;
strengthen the referral system and improve the quality of care at the first referral level. These&#13;
include: (a) strengthening the management of the referral system; (b) implementing the referral&#13;
protocols that specify the "what", "when" and "how" of referrals; (c) implementing clinical&#13;
management protocols that specify the essential processcs of clinical management by staff who&#13;
manage common conditions without the direct supervision of relevant specialists; and (d)&#13;
establishing an incentive system (explained below). Special attcntion would also be given to&#13;
establishing mechanismis to improve access for remote and disadvantagcd groups and tribal&#13;
communities. The project would establish linkages and communications between the first referral&#13;
and primary health care levels. The first refcrral hospitals would provide clinical and tcchnical&#13;
support to the PHCs; clinical skills at secondary facilities would be updated and upgraded;&#13;
technical support for the primary level of carc and community hospitals would be strengthened;&#13;
rcferral mechanisms between community, subdivisional and district hospitals would be&#13;
strcngthened; and mechanisms to provide greater access to secondary and higher levels of health&#13;
care would be formulated by making the referral system more timely, effective and client-friendly.&#13;
The Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would strengthen the referral system by&#13;
establishing an incentive system with differentiated user fees for users and non-users and allowing&#13;
patients to by-pass waiting lines when they carry a referral slip.&#13;
19.    Selective Investments in Primarv Health Care. especially for Women and SC/ST&#13;
Populations. The project's tribal and underdeveloped areas strategy is aimed at increasing the&#13;
demand for hospital services in tribal and underdeveloped areas by improving the quality of&#13;
services and providing effective IEC to better inform tribal and disadvantaged populations of the&#13;
benefits of using health services at secondary hospitals. The number of beds at sub-divisional and&#13;
community hospitals located in tribal and underdeveloped arcas will be increased to reflect a share&#13;
of beds at secondary hospitals that is much more commcnsurate with their proportion in the overall&#13;
population of the states. In addition, to increasing the bed strength in tribal and remotc hospitals,&#13;
the project would: (a) strengthen linkages bctwecn primary and secondary health care services; (b)&#13;
provide an incentive package to doctors and other medical staff in tribal and underdeveloped areas&#13;
to cncourage them to accept assignment in these areas; (c) increase the appropriate utilization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
164                                Annex 14&#13;
Page 10 of 14&#13;
non-tribal medical system by tribal population and reduce the cost to the poor, including tribals, of&#13;
utilizing the system (see Annex 16).&#13;
20.   In addition, the project would provide much greater access to women, particularly rural&#13;
women, and improve the quality of services they receive. More specifically, by strengthening the&#13;
referral mechanism and linking the community hospitals with primary health centers, the project&#13;
would assist in providing timely access to emergency obstetric care. The project would also&#13;
promote a life-cycle approach to women's health, taking into account some of the main&#13;
recommendations of the Cairo Conference on women's reproductive health, such as screening for&#13;
reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), providing&#13;
appropriate information, education and communication (IEC) to promote the value of the girl-child,&#13;
and increasing women's awareness of their options in terms of health care.&#13;
21.    Specific components included in the project to address these issues are: Upgrading of&#13;
Primary Health Centers in the Sunderban Areas of West Bengal. The Sundarban area in southern&#13;
West Bengal, with a population of about 3.1 million people, is among the poorest regions in the&#13;
state and is most lacking in adequate health facilities. It is therefore proposed that the project&#13;
would upgrade all PHCs and block PHCs in the region. In addition, three floating medical units&#13;
will be set up to deliver effective health care in the riverine areas and would be supported by&#13;
wireless connection. A wireless communication system will also link up the 36 PHCs and block&#13;
PHCs with the gram panchayat office. Increasing Access to Primary Care Services Among SC/ST&#13;
Population in Karnataka . A system of annual health check-ups is proposed under the project for&#13;
the SC/ST population of Karnataka, which account for nearly 20% of the population. The medical&#13;
check-ups will be made available in health check-up camps to bc organized at thc headquarters of&#13;
every auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM).&#13;
22.    Means-tested Cost Recovery. Previous sector work indicates that the revenue collectcd in&#13;
the three states from user charges varies between 3% and 7% of the health budget of the states.&#13;
International experience in developing countries with somewhat higher per capita incomc than&#13;
India, and where the performance of the public health sector has been relatively better, show that&#13;
revenue collected from user charges accounts for about 15-20% of the health budget. The&#13;
Governments of the three states recognize the importance of increasing revenue collection through&#13;
user charges for the sustainability of the sector. The strategy with regard to the implementation of&#13;
user charges takes into account both the willingness of most people to pay something towards&#13;
services rendered, given improvements in the quality of basic services and infrastructure i.e.&#13;
voluntary payment, and the need to adequately exempt the poorest sections who simply cannot&#13;
afford to pay. In order to encourage greater voluntary payments of user charges, the state&#13;
Governments have stated that user charges would be more widely implemented in a phased manner&#13;
for treatment and diagnostic services, after the improvements in quality have been implemented.&#13;
Fees for services such as paying beds, cabins, and charges for a range of diagnostic services and&#13;
outpatient registration fees would be more widely implemented. User fees would be used&#13;
specifically for non-salary recurrent cost purposes, particularly to purchase drugs and medical&#13;
supplies. The Governments would institute adequate administrative mechanisms for collecting user&#13;
fees and enhance the Governments' resource generation capacity through the appointment of key&#13;
staff in its Finance and Audit unit. (See Annex 5 for details on exemptions for the poor).&#13;
23.   Increasing the Scope for Private Sector Involvement in Service Deliverv. Contracting-out&#13;
Selected Services. Private contractual services are often more efficient and effective than direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
165                               Annex 14&#13;
Page 11 of 14&#13;
labor. In view of the difficulties of employing government staff, such as slow recruitment and&#13;
absenteeism, contracting-out certain services, especially support services, becomes even more&#13;
attractive. It has been confirmed that there are no legal barriers inhibiting the use of contractual&#13;
services for support functions and that the Contract Labor Regulation and Abolition Act (1970),&#13;
which prohibits certain institutions from contracting-out perennial services, exempt hospitals and&#13;
health care facilities. In order to cut costs and increase efficiency, the Governments of Karnataka,&#13;
Punjab and West Bengal would review and propose implementation of private contractual services,&#13;
especially supporting services.&#13;
24.    Linkages with the Private and Voluntary Sectors. The state Governments have proposed&#13;
to enhance the participation of the voluntary sector, especially for improving access to primnary&#13;
health care and first referral services in remote and underdeveloped areas of the Sunderban in West&#13;
Bengal and for disadvantaged groups, particularly SC/STs in Karnataka. The state Governments&#13;
are also exploring opportunities for contracting out the delivery of health care in remote areas to&#13;
the voluntary sector which has a comparative advantage in improving access to such health&#13;
services for some disadvantaged groups. On matters of ensuring the quality of health care&#13;
provision, state Governments would also play a more pro-active role, through legislation such as&#13;
the Nursing Home Registration Act which is pending Parliamentary clearance in Karnataka and&#13;
Punjab.&#13;
25.    Decentralization of Management and Administration. Retention and Use of Revenue&#13;
Collected. To provide incentives to hospitals for collecting user charges, all three states have&#13;
proposed to implement a system that would ensure that revenuc collected through user charges&#13;
would not go back to the state treasury in Kamataka and West Bengal. The revenue collected&#13;
through user charges would be retained at the district level to be reallocated by district level health&#13;
authorities amongst hospitals in the district, based on both nced and level of revenue collection. In&#13;
Punjab, revenue collected would be retained at the point of collection.&#13;
26.    Project Management. During preparation the Government stated that the DOHFW did not&#13;
have the capacity to implement a project of this scope. In addition, a project preparation workshop&#13;
held in Chandigarh recommended that an independent agency would be more suitable to implement&#13;
the proposed project. Therefore, a model similar to the APVVP was adopted. The IDA mission&#13;
recognised the implication of the proposed management structure and the initial start-up problems&#13;
this would entail. However, the benefits of this approach, namely, the independence to carry out&#13;
project work more efficiently, implementing user charges and being more self-sustaiiing in the long&#13;
run, outweigh the possible associated risks.&#13;
27.    Civil Works and Maintenance. Due to the scope of the civil works component and the&#13;
need to ensure adequate maintenance of assets, the Health Department's role in Karnataka and&#13;
West Bengal would be strengthened by providing it with enhanced management and supervision&#13;
responsibilities of essential operational activities including construction and maintenance activities&#13;
in collaboration with local government. These responsibilities now lie with the Public Works&#13;
Department which would be unable to adequately fulfill its obligations to the Health Department&#13;
due to the diverse functions it is called upon to perform. A Design and Engineering Wing would be&#13;
set up in the Health Department at both the state and district levels, and flow of funds would be&#13;
channeled through DOHFW. In addition, a maintenance cell will be established in each large&#13;
hospital to manage day-to-day emergent maintenance works. In Punjab, the establishment of a&#13;
Health Systems Corporation with substantial autonomy in carrying out essential operational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
166                                Annex 14&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
activities would facilitate implementation of the project at both state and district levels, and the&#13;
flow of funds would be channeled through the Corporation.&#13;
28.    Workforce Issues. There is currently no acute shortage of professional staff overall, but&#13;
there is a shortage of some medical specialties and nurses. The first step would be to improve&#13;
recruitment and prompt filling of job vacancies by improving the main procedures. The states will&#13;
put appropriate regulations in place so that state Governments have the authority to: (i) advertise,&#13;
appoint, promote and transfer staff internally; (ii) post staff as needed, especially in tribal areas;&#13;
(iii) introduce appropriate incentives to retain staff in remote areas including: provision of staff&#13;
quarters, bonus at the end of a specified period of posting, educational allowance for children of&#13;
staff posted in remote and tribal areas, additional leave eligibility and extra weightage for doctors&#13;
and other staff for PG qualification admission and for fellowships; and (iv) relax service rules as&#13;
necessary to maintain service when appropriately qualified staff are unavailable.&#13;
29.    Information. Education and Communication. Six broad strategies are proposed for this&#13;
component: (a) increase awareness of the services provided by first referral hospitals, and the&#13;
functioning of the referral system, particularly among lower income and disadvantaged groups&#13;
(such as tribals), and thereby increase utilization of the system; (b) improve access to the expanded&#13;
range of all reproductive health services among women; (c) motivate all hospital staff to maintain&#13;
good standards of patient care in terms of 'care, courtesy and comfort' so that the quality of&#13;
services received by patients is enhanced; (d) sensitize staff to hospital and equipment maintenance&#13;
issues; (e) promote hospital services to specific groups in a manner that increases their willingness&#13;
to utilize these services and, where possible, to share in the costs of service delivery; and (f)&#13;
address specific public health issues in each state such as road safcty, alcohol abusc, healthy diet&#13;
(particularly in Punjab), and women's issues.&#13;
30.    Five groups will be includcd in the target audiencc.  First, govcrnmcnt functionaries&#13;
working at the grassroots level -- anganwadi workers, gram sevikas, school teachers, agricultural&#13;
extension workers and multipurpose health workers -- would be targeted for information pertaining&#13;
to the availability of different types of health care at differcnt levels within the health care system.&#13;
These workers are likely to be seen as opinion leaders by the populations they serve and they can&#13;
be key information sources in spreading knowledge about the availability of services and the&#13;
referral system. Second, women would be considered as a priority target, since their access to&#13;
health facilities is comparatively low. They are, in addition, managers of the health status of the&#13;
household and have demonstrated their ability as a group to mobilize the community. Third,&#13;
patients who enter the hospital system would be considered a priority target. Their word-of-mouth&#13;
based on their first-hand experience will carry far more weight than any other channel of&#13;
communication. The imperative of creating satisfied customers, and thereby expanding the demand&#13;
for services, particularly in tribal areas, must be recognized for the communication strategy to&#13;
succeed. Fourth, private practitioners and NGOs would be targeted because of their potential role&#13;
in referring patients, and because they should be aware of the improved standards of care in first&#13;
referral hospitals. Fifth, the population in the Sunderban area of West Bengal and SC/ST groups&#13;
in Karnataka will be targeted, to raise aw areness in those communities of the increased access to&#13;
and improved quality of primary health care services now available to them.&#13;
&#13;

Poverty Aspects&#13;
31.   In India the public health system is utilized predominantly by the lower income groups,&#13;
especially at the secondary level. Those who can afford to pay usually prefer using private&#13;
hospitals. Country-wide health sector studies have shown that the public sector hospital care seems&#13;
well targeted to the poor, with over seventy percent of public hospital users being from the lower&#13;
forty percent of income distribution. These findings are confirmed by the beneficiary assessment&#13;
for Karnataka, which includes an analysis of secondary hospital patients by family income. This&#13;
anal- s'is found that in Karnataka over 45 percent of the patients have an annual income below Rs.&#13;
15,000 (close to the official poverty line), and over 90 percent of the patients have an annual&#13;
income below the taxable level of Rs. 50,000.&#13;
32.    General Poverty Imnact. By improving health service quality, access, and effectiveness at&#13;
the secondary level, this project will disproportionately benefit the poor and underprivileged&#13;
segments of the states' population. Beneficiary studies in the project states have shown that while&#13;
the poor are the major users of these public health facilities and would therefore benefit from any&#13;
improvements within the secondary health system, perceived quality, access and effectiveness of&#13;
health interventions at this level are major barriers faced especially by the poor. This project will&#13;
also focus on addressing these barriers and thereby increasing the utilization of these services by&#13;
the poor.&#13;
33.    Si,ecial Poverty Interventions/Areas of Emphasis. In addition to having the overall aim of&#13;
improving secondary health services for the poor, each state has undertaken special initiatives&#13;
under this project in order to rcach the most vulnerable and poor: In West Bengal, where 44&#13;
percent of the people are below the poverty line and rural povcrty avcrages around 48 percent,&#13;
poverty in the Sunderban Areas lies yet above this average. In addition to including some of the&#13;
poorest populations of the state, the Sunderban face the additional problem of being remotc,&#13;
difficult to access, and having low availability of even primary health care services. This project&#13;
wvill seek to redress the problems that the poor in thcsc remote areas face in accessing health carc,&#13;
by upgrading all primary health centers in the Sunderban Areas. In addition, three floating medical&#13;
units supported by a wireless communications system will be set up in order to enable effective&#13;
primary health care deliver in these remote, rivenrne areas.&#13;
34.   In Karnataka, where the percentage of people in poverty at 38 percent is close the all-India&#13;
average, the main issues of the poor's access to health services center around increasing access to&#13;
primary and secondary health care services for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe populations&#13;
of the state. Beneficiary assessments have shown that these are the people with the highest&#13;
percentage of poverty and often with the least access to public health services. In order to reach&#13;
out to these populations, heighten their awareness of the types of services available, and to improve&#13;
their health indicators, Karnataka will institute a system of annual health check-ups for the entire&#13;
SC/ST population. These health check camps would serve as a early screening forum for&#13;
preventive health care, would enable direct IEC to communicate the levels of health care services&#13;
and facilities available, and would above all increase basic health care delivery to some of the&#13;
poorest segments of the population.&#13;
35.   In Punjab, the percentage of people below the poverty line is the lowest in the country, at&#13;
12.7 percent. This figure, however, masks great regiQnal differences within the state. In the&#13;
poorest region of the state, the Upper Bari Doab area, 30 percent of the overall population and 40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
168                                Annex 14&#13;
Page 14 of 14&#13;
of the rural population live below the poverty line. In the next poorest region, Southern Malwa,&#13;
rural poverty is 25 percent. Since this project focuses on first-referral hospitals, which are usually&#13;
located in the rural areas, it is these high rural poverty rates in the two regions of Punjab that are of&#13;
real concern. To address the issue of access and equity faced by the rural poor in these two&#13;
regions, 57 percent of the first-referral hospitals to be upgraded will be located in these poorer,&#13;
rural areas. Moreover, 61 percent of the total cost of hospital upgradation in Punjab will be&#13;
allocated to hospitals in the Upper Bari Doab and Southern Malwa areas. By focusing the project&#13;
on the areas with a greater percentage of people below the poverty line, Punjab airns to redress the&#13;
current difficulties of quality and access to health care services faced by the poor.&#13;
36.    Exempting the Poor from User Charges. Although the implementation of user charges in&#13;
order to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the first referral health system is justified,&#13;
there is a very valid concem regarding the targeting of poor people for exemptions from user&#13;
charges. Given the differences in management and administration, income levels and underlying&#13;
structure of the economy in the three states, it is proposed that different income criteria by state be&#13;
applied for exempting the poor from user charges. Details of an appropriate exemption mechanism&#13;
to be implemented in each state are provided in Annex S.&#13;
&#13;

SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
General Routine Supervision&#13;
1.     The core of the routine supervision process will be the six-monthly Bank supervision missions. An&#13;
indispensable basis for this will be the six-monthly progress report to be submitted by the Health Systems&#13;
Corporation in Punjab and the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Karnataka and West Bengal. Because&#13;
of the commonality of the program in the states of Kamataka, Punjab and West Bengal as well as that of Andhra&#13;
Pradesh under the First Referral Health Systern Project, every effort will be made to coordinate the developme-nt of&#13;
the projects in the four states and to encourage the states to share their implementation experience. During project&#13;
preparation, the initiative taken by the Union Ministry of Health to bring the states together worked very well. This&#13;
process should continue to be fostered during the implementation period as well. This will result in considerable&#13;
cross-fertilization of implementation experience across the project states and learning from each other. The Bank&#13;
supervision team can play a key role in facilitating this process. This process will also result in substantial cost&#13;
savings of supervising a project of this size since we can eliminate a number of repetitious tasks in each state.&#13;
2. -   Mission Fre[uencv. Scheduling, Proarams.  Regular Bank supervision missions will visit the project&#13;
approximately every six months. Thus if the project is launched in May-June 1996, supervision missions would be&#13;
scheduled between October-November, 1996 and between April-May, 1997. Apart from two main rnissions during&#13;
the first year of implementation, a number of other interventions may be necessary from our side, including short&#13;
visits to the states to facilitate project start-up. In subsequent years, we would be back to a two-mission a year&#13;
scheduled as noted above.&#13;
3.     On each supervision mission the project coordinators in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal will present a&#13;
six-monthly progress report on the status of implementation for review and discussion. The Chief Engineer of the&#13;
construction wing of the Health Department in Kamataka and West Bengal and the Health Systems Corporation in&#13;
Punjab will also make presentations about the progress of civil works component to be incorporated in an overall&#13;
progress report. The Secretary, and in his absence, the Additional/Joint Secretary of the Department of Health and&#13;
Family Welfare will update the mission on thc progress on policy issues of the project.&#13;
4.     Each supervision mission will include field trips visiting a sample of diffcrent district, subdivisional, and&#13;
rural/conmmunity hospitals. The mission will be appropriately staffed as discussed below. Tribal areas in Kamataka&#13;
and West Bengal will be visited at least once every year which will include a tribal specialist who will visit a sample&#13;
of project sites and facilitate the six monthly supervision missions.&#13;
5.     Composition of Missions. The missions will be led by the Bank task manager and will include as&#13;
appropriate at the time, specialists in hospital management, public health, hospital equipment matters, economics,&#13;
general management training, [EC and tribal issues, HMIS, surveillance and medical waste management. Specialists&#13;
may also visit the states separately and individually by prior arrangement between the task manager and the Health&#13;
Systems Corporation in Punjab and the Department of Health, Medical and Family Welfare in Kamataka and West&#13;
Bengal. In addition, required specialists in other areas may occasionally be included in missions as needed.&#13;
6.     Additional Missions. In addition to the above, the task manager may visit the three states with or without&#13;
specialist colleagues, in between routine supervision missions as needed for trouble-shooting or emergencies, or&#13;
during the first year of the project in order to help ensure that project implementation gets off to a smooth start. The&#13;
task manager may also, by prior arrangement with the concemed agencies in the states, authorize individual&#13;
specialists to make separate between-mission visits. Every effort will be made during supervision missions to link the&#13;
supervision of activities in other Health and Family Welfaie projects in the states which are interlinked with this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

project. Supervision of other projects may also be requested to follow-up on selected activities of State Health II&#13;
based on the concept of state-based supervision.&#13;
7.     Supervision of Policy Reforms: Six monthly supervision will monitor compliance of the Policy Reform&#13;
program. An econormist and a managernent/instrituional specialist will be assigned responsibility during supervision&#13;
rmissions to monitor compliance and progress on policy matters.&#13;
8.     Supervision of Software Aspects: In addition to the technical specialists that will accompany the Bank&#13;
supervision team as appropriate, contacts have been established with the WHO tearn in Delbi to assist in the&#13;
supervision of the technical aspects of the project. The Bank team will continue to bring in experts in the areas of&#13;
public health, hospital and equipment management, IEC, HMIS, surveillance and waste management.&#13;
9.     Special Arrangements for Civil Works. The civil works component is complex and costly and covers more&#13;
than 201 hospitals in Karnataka, 150 hospitals in Punjab and 170 hospitals in West Bengal of varying sizes in&#13;
addition to 28 PHCs and 8 Block PHCs in West Bengal. It therefore cannot be adequately supervised in the field by&#13;
an architect visiting twvice a year for a couple of weeks. A pyrarmidal, locally-based system of field monitoring for&#13;
this .component will therefore supplement the supervision arrangements described above. In addition, the civil works&#13;
component will be covered by a special extra system of locally based supervision undertaken by the construction&#13;
wing of the implementing agency in each state. There will be three layers, as follows:&#13;
(a)    The first layer will be the maintenance of a civil works archive in the Human Resources Unit of the&#13;
Bank's Delhi office, under the day-to-day supervision of one of the staff members. The&#13;
implementing agencies in the three states will send to this archive particulars of each hospital for&#13;
renovation and extension for which construction will be undertaken. This will include final as-built&#13;
drawings and contracts entered into for renovations and extensions.&#13;
(b)    The second layer will consist of local consultant architects who will report to the project task&#13;
manager and will:&#13;
(i)    review new arrivals in the archives once a month or oncc every two months as necessary&#13;
depending on the volume of arrivals, and screen them for any departures from criteria or&#13;
other features agreed upon at appraisal;&#13;
(ii)    in some cases, just prior to the regular Bank supervision missions and under a briefing&#13;
from the mission leader, visit the state to: (a) discuss cases departing from criteria set out&#13;
in the technical manual with the Chief Engineer of the Construction Wing and the Project&#13;
Coordinators in each state; and (b) make site visits to an appropriate sample of district,&#13;
subdivisional and rural/cornmunity hospitals departing from criteria;&#13;
(iii)    after these visits, report findings to the Project Coordinator and Chief Engineer and to the&#13;
regular mission architect at the start of the supervision rmission, as well as filing a report of&#13;
the findings in the project archives.&#13;
(c)    The third layer will consist of the regular supervision missions. At the start of each mission, the&#13;
rmission architect will review the reports of the local architect consultants and discuss them with the&#13;
implementing agencies. The architect will then make site visits, in the state visited by the mission,&#13;
to any identified problem buildings plus a random sample, drawn by him/her, of the buildings&#13;
reviewed by the local consultants during the previous six months.&#13;
&#13;

10.    Six-Monthly Project Progress Report: This Wi,1 report on the Performance Indicators highlighted in Annex&#13;
22. Corresponding computer software may be provided to the implementing agencies for use in report preparation.&#13;
The format will be followed as is for the first year of the project. It will then be evaluated by the implementng&#13;
agencies in time for the third supervision mission, discussed at the joint meeting, and revised as necessary by&#13;
agreement between the implementing agencies and the mission team.&#13;
The Mid-Term Project Review&#13;
11.    The Mid-Term Review of project progress will be carried out by an IDA mission and the implementing&#13;
agencies in the three states, with a separate sub-review by the Department of Health and Family Welfare for Punjab,&#13;
and submitted to IDA approximately halfway through the project period; if the project is launched in mid-1996, this&#13;
point would be approximately July 1999. The entire reView process should take two to three months. The findings of&#13;
the reviev would then be discussed during the next regular supervision mission. This mission would first hold a&#13;
general meeting with implementing agencies as well as the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Punjab to&#13;
discuss the findings of the Review.&#13;
12..   The principal aim of the Mid-Term Review Will be to determine if there are any major problems or issues in&#13;
the project which necessitate re-thinking the original project design and making mid-course corrections. It also may&#13;
be used for a preliminary evaluation of the impact of the project, if the project has progressed sufficiently to expect&#13;
any impact.&#13;
13.    The Mid-Term Review will consist of an intemal stocktaking from the project records and MIS of the&#13;
progress of project activities as measured against the original program and time schedule set out in the SAR and&#13;
Implementation Plan (see Annex 21) plus optimal additional parts as appropriate. Notes should be included on the&#13;
status of fulfillment of project agreements and covenants, on the results of the evaluation of a management reviewv,&#13;
project's policy refbrms aspects such as cost recovery policies, and on progress with the strategies for improving&#13;
services to tribal groups. The stocktaking may also include indicators of the burdcn of disease and epidermiology.&#13;
14.    A final Mid-Term Review Report will be submitted to IDA and discussed with the following supervision&#13;
mrission. It should highlight any major problems, issues, bottlenecks or delays in the project execution and the&#13;
prospects for resolving them and completing the project on time.&#13;
15.    The Mid-Term  Review may be extended beyond those issues discussed above if this is considered&#13;
appropriate and useful. The implementing agencies would decide upon the full review content, in consultation with&#13;
IDA, at the beginning of planning for the review. Further elements of the review could include:&#13;
(a)    a managemnent review of the organizational structure in each state;&#13;
(b)    a repeat of the beneficiary social assessment and training needs carried out as part of project&#13;
preparation;&#13;
(c)    special in-depth evaluative studies of the private health sector, workforce issues etc.;&#13;
(d)    reviews of project progress by an extemal agency. However, this would be at the discretion of the&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;

Role of the Resident Mission&#13;
16.    The human resources group of the New Delhi office has been strengthened to carry out an increasing share&#13;
of the supervision work for human resources projects in India. This group will play an important role in this project.&#13;
First, our senior public health adviser in Delhi mnay be asked to foUlow-up on fundamental issues. Our local public&#13;
health specialist in Delhi vill help monitor the project on a regular basis, follow-up on key implementation issues,&#13;
and trouble shoot in the field, as needed. He/she will be assisted by a local staff speciaizing in the administration of&#13;
projects. Procurement issues and guidance will be handled by the Delhi Office Procurement and Accounting Group.&#13;
That same group will handle accounting, auditing, disbursement, and flow of funds issues. These actions will be part&#13;
of the overall supervision program noted above.&#13;

            improvements in the quality, effectiveness and coverage of
            health services at the first referral level and selective
            coverage at the primary level to better serve the neediest
