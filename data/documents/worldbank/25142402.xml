     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Tuberculosis (TB), long associated with poverty, crowding and poor living conditions, remains a significant source of suffering in India with an estimated 2.2 million&#13;
     new cases and 270,000 deaths annually. At the same time, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is difficult and expensive to diagnose and treat, is a threat with&#13;
     estimates as high as 64,000 new cases a year. The nationâ&#128;&#153;s Revised National TB Control Program has successfully ensured coverage of first-line TB services across the&#13;
     country and provides diagnosis and treatment to about 1.5 million TB patients annually. Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Strategic Plan for TB Control seeks to further expand access&#13;
     to effective diagnosis and treatment, expand collaboration with the private sector, and scale up services for MDR-TB. This is the third World Bank operation to support&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s TB program since 1998.&#13;
     The project development objective is to support Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control in expanding quality diagnosis and treatment services for TB&#13;
     sufferers.&#13;
     Components include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       New strategies to reach more tuberculosis patients with earlier and more effective care: Extending the TB programâ&#128;&#153;s reach to patients in the private sector while&#13;
            expanding urban services, improving access to diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and leveraging information technology while improving knowledge.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Scale up and improve diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: Effectively treating drug-sensitive TB to prevent development of drug-resistant&#13;
            strains, and improving early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of MDR-TB patients to prevent further airborne transmission. Focus on expanding and improv-&#13;
            ing public sector TB services increasingly integrated with the government primary health care system.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Increase the number of people receiving TB treatment in accordance with the World Health Organization-recommended â&#128;&#156;Directly Observed Treatment Strategyâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
            from the current 345,332 to a target of more than three million, including more than 1.1 million women and girls.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Increase government notification of TB patients receiving care in the private sector, initial treatment of drug-resistant TB patients, and drug-sensitivity testing of&#13;
            TB suspects and patients.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The project supports rehabilitation of selected minor irrigation tanks in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Tanks are small water reservoirs that store rainwater run-off,&#13;
primarily from the monsoon. This water is subsequently used for irrigation and other agricultural activities. The state has a long tradition of tank irrigation with more&#13;
than 70,000 tanks in the state. Over time, however, largely due to inadequate maintenance of tank systems, the area irrigated by tanks has declined. This project&#13;
supports rehabilitation of tanks with the active participation of water user associations (WUA) from the local community. Similar projects have also been (and are&#13;
being) supported in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha.&#13;
The project development objective is for selected tank-based producers to improve agricultural productivity and help water user associations to manage tank systems&#13;
effectively. The project supports investments across four components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Institutional strengthening: Focuses on strengthening community-based institutions to enable them to assume greater responsibility for managing tank systems.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Minor irrigation systems improvements: Supports rehabilitation of tank systems and also promotes more effective groundwater management in selected tanks.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Agricultural livelihoods support services: Covers agriculture, horticulture and fisheries.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project management&#13;
Activities financed under this project include: (i) rehabilitation of around 2,150 selected tank systems that together irrigate about 255,000 hectares of crop area;&#13;
(ii) agricultural intensification and diversification through programs for developing agriculture, horticulture, and fisheries activities in the tank systems being&#13;
rehabilitated; (iii) training and capacity building of about 2,150 WUAs to promote self-management in the tank systems being rehabilitated, and related training and&#13;
capacity building for public institutions involved in supporting irrigated agriculture; and (iv) project implementation support, monitoring and evaluation, and project&#13;
coordination by multi-disciplinary teams at appropriate levels.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
Good progress has been made toward achieving the project development objective. Data reported from a sample of project tanks indicate that:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Yields of main crops like paddy, maize, and groundnut have increased by 21 percent, 36 percent, and 51 percent, respectively.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Cropping intensity has increased by 23 percent from baseline values.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      In tanks where fisheries interventions have been undertaken, fish productivity has increased nearly four times from baseline values.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Institutional strengthening efforts have also led to improvement in WUA functioning as measured through a number of intermediate outcome indicators.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     In the 1980s the Bank funded projects with the Hyderabad Water Board. Andhra Pradesh is among the more urbanized states in India, with a total population of about&#13;
     84 million, 34 percent of which lives in urban areas. The state has three cities with a population of over one million, including its capital, Hyderabad. Like many states&#13;
     across the country, Andhra Pradesh faces fundamental challenges in managing urbanization and providing for adequate services to a growing urban population:&#13;
     housing, water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid waste management, and transportation.&#13;
&#13;
     This project is the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first recent re-engagement in the urban sector with the state of Andhra Pradesh. The project objective is to help improve urban services in&#13;
     the state, and build the capacity of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to sustain and expand urban services. Urban service improvements are chosen in a demand-driven&#13;
     manner and implemented by ULBs, subject to several access and performance criteria, and with necessary technical support. The project supports improvements in the&#13;
     financial, technical, and management capacities of all ULBs through technical assistance. The project will also support improvements in the state-level framework that&#13;
     defines ULBsâ&#128;&#153; autonomy, accountability, and incentives for performance, as well as the government of Andhra Pradeshâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to monitor ULBsâ&#128;&#153; performances and&#13;
     to provide policy and technical support for their development. The project components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      State-level policy and institutional development support: To improve the stateâ&#128;&#153;s policy and institutional framework to support service delivery and capacity build-&#13;
            ing by ULBs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Municipal capacity enhancement: To enhance the financial and technical capacity, and operating systems of ULBs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Urban infrastructure investment: To finance sustainable, high-priority investments identified by ULBs to improve urban services or operational efficiency.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Project management technical assistance: To ensure the quality of subproject preparation, implementation, and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      About $340 million of urban sub-projects have been prepared and are being taken up for implementation across 10 participating ULBs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Over 2 million city residents in nine participating ULBs that currently receive one to three hours of water supply (not even daily, in many cases) are expected to&#13;
            benefit from improved levels of water supply.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The National Institute of Urban Management (NIUM) has been set up as a legal entity and has commenced operations from a temporary campus under an acting&#13;
            director, while its final campus is about to commence construction.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      GIS mapping and municipal E-governance activities are commencing across about 120 ULBs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Training of urban sector staff has started, and over 2,000 staff has already received training against a project target of 500.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Andhra Pradesh is one of the most natural hazard prone states in India owing to its long coastline and geographical location. About 44 percent of the state is vulnerable&#13;
to tropical storms and related hazards. In addition to cyclones and related hazards, monsoon depressions bring heavy to very heavy rains causing floods in the inland&#13;
rivers between June and September. Coastal erosion is a critical problem and, out of the 974 km, about 440 km of coastline faces coastal erosion. Andhra Pradesh is&#13;
also exposed to moderate earthquake risk.&#13;
&#13;
On October 12, 2014, a very server cyclonic storm â&#128;&#156;Hudhudâ&#128;&#157; made landfall on the coast of Andhra Pradesh, near the city of Visakhapatnam. At the time of landfall, the&#13;
estimated maximum sustained surface wind speed was about 180 kmph. Tide gauge at Visakhapatnam reported maximum storm surge of about 1.4 meters above the&#13;
astronomical tide. Cyclone Hudhud and associated floods due to heavy rainfall caused major damage in districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, and East&#13;
Godavari along the coast.&#13;
&#13;
Following a request from the Government of India, World Bank conducted a rapid multi-sectoral assessment damages and needs and estimated the total damages&#13;
caused by Cyclone Hudhud at about $2.16 billion, of which the livelihoods sector was the most severely hit with recovery needs estimated to be around $443 million,&#13;
followed by housing sector ($439 million) and the roads sector ($375 million).&#13;
The APDRP takes into account the lessons learned from supporting post-cyclone restoration and attempts to improve the resilience of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure and its&#13;
communities from impacts of future disasters.&#13;
The project includes the following components: (i) Resilient electrical network $81 million); (ii) Restoration of connectivity and shelter infrastructure ($71 million); (iii)&#13;
Restoration and protection of beach front ($44 million); (iv) Restoration of environmental services and facilities and livelihood support ($13.3 million); (v) Capacity&#13;
building and technical support for disaster risk management ($23.7 million); (vi) Implementation Support ($17 million); and (vii) Contingent Emergency Response..&#13;
The investments are expected to support the recovery, and improve the resilience of public services, environmental facilities and livelihoods, as well as enhance the&#13;
capacity of the state entities to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      300,000 people covered by underground electrical network.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      1.75 million people to benefit from restored and improved roads and shelters.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      1.73 million people to benefit from access to restored and improved beachfront.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      1.73 million people to benefit from restored and improved environmental services/ facilities.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Andhra Pradesh is one of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s most progressive states. Its economic, social, health, and education indicators are better than the national average, and on par&#13;
     with its neighboring states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Road transport accounts for more than 80 percent of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s freight and passenger traffic. The&#13;
     governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Vision 2020 strategy recognizes that an efficient transport system is a necessary foundation for agricultural and industrial growth, and consequently for&#13;
     achieving its economic growth and poverty reduction goals. The capacity and quality of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s core road network has improved considerably in recent years, and&#13;
     although maintenance spending has increased, it is still not adequate. In 2004-05, the government spent about Rs.3.7 billion on maintaining existing road assets,&#13;
     significantly short of the Finance Commissionâ&#128;&#153;s standard of Rs.5.68 billion for road maintenance.&#13;
     The project development objective is to provide better quality, capacity, and safe roads to users in a sustainable manner by enhancing the institutional capacity of the&#13;
     Andhra Pradesh government in the road sector. The project consists of four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road improvement includes two activities to upgrade and maintain the stateâ&#128;&#153;s Core Road Network (CRN).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    PPP facilitation support will strengthen the capacity of the government of Andhra Pradesh to develop selected high-density traffic corridors under Public-Private&#13;
          Partnership arrangement, via toll revenues and viability gap support from the central and state governments.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening will provide technical assistance, training, and advisory services for: (1) operationalization of Andhra Pradesh Road Development&#13;
          Corporation (APRDC); and (ii) project implementation including asset management, the Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), and the Institutional&#13;
          Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety will help the government of Andhra Pradesh develop safer road corridors by initiating measures to reduce road accidents. The Bank will help agencies&#13;
          undertake demonstration projects on selected core road network corridors; carry out an extended black-spot improvement program (geometric improvement of&#13;
          stretches with high incidence of accidents); and implement institutional and policy actions plans for improving the stateâ&#128;&#153;s road safety responsibility framework&#13;
          and capacities.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     Under the project, 429 km of roads will be upgraded and 6,241 km of roads will be maintained under long-term performance-based maintenance contracts. More&#13;
     specific expected results include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Share of the CRN in good condition increased from the baseline of 40 percent (2009) to 56 percent (2014) as a result of the use of long-term performance based&#13;
          contracts for maintenance. Some 6,151 km of CRN are already under long-term performance based maintenance contracts.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Transactional advisors, GAAP/APRDC have examined the feasibility of eight roads, for development as PPP concessions. Two of these roads with a total length of&#13;
          420 km and an estimated project cost of about $450 million, have been awarded as PPP concessions in 2010 and are in advanced stage of construction.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Full operationalization of the APRDC with adequate financial and human resources to manage the CRN.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    150 km out of 429km upgraded and travel time has been reduced by more than 25 percent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Expected improvement in road safety in two model/demonstration corridors.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Andhra Pradesh is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, the prosperity is unevenly&#13;
distributed: the poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes (STs), Schedules Castes (SCs), and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. A&#13;
more equitable distribution of the growth (or higher shared prosperity) is a key challenge going forward. There are two main aspects of this challenge. First, there is&#13;
an income deficit since the small and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted from the potential growth in the agriculture.&#13;
This is primarily because they have not been able to take advantage of the potential benefits from the sub-sectors like horticulture, livestock, and fisheries. The other&#13;
deficit is the human development deficit, as most health and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. The income deficit and the human development deficit&#13;
needed to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a greater pace of poverty reduction. Therefore, the project has been designed as a new generation&#13;
multi-sectoral rural-inclusive growth project that will work concurrently on economic development, human development and social protection areas with a strong focus&#13;
on information and communications technology (ICT). Given the multi-sectoral nature of the project within the Bank team, the project preparation involve collaboration&#13;
between a number of global practices like Agriculture, Health &amp; Nutrition, Social Protection, and Governance &amp; ICT. The project is also a new generation livelihood&#13;
project and lessons from the project will be taken to low-income states like Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan where rural livelihood projects are currently&#13;
operational.&#13;
The project development objective is to enable selected poor households to enhance agricultural incomes and secure increased access to human development services&#13;
and social entitlements. The project has five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and&#13;
     improved market access. This component will also invigorate local markets by connecting rural producers and enterprises with the rural consumers.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Human development: The focus here is to enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the human development (HD)&#13;
     sector, as well as to improve HD service delivery by strengthening the existing public systems to deliver quality services. The interventions will target health,&#13;
     nutrition, sanitation, and education.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Access to social protection services and entitlements: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the&#13;
     poorest households.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Mission support, ICT and partnerships: ICT use especially open data systems and data analytics will be critical for the project. This component will support the&#13;
     missions recently launched by the government to ensure real-time analytics, open data systems and feedback-based policy development at the state level. It will&#13;
     also create an enabling ecosystem for innovation and transformation in delivering high quality last-mile services planned under the other components.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project implementation support: The objective of this component is to strengthen the project implementation by establishing monitoring, evaluation and learn-&#13;
     ing (MEL) systems, financial management systems, procurement management, governance and accountability systems, and knowledge management and com-&#13;
     munication.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The water sector in Andhra Pradesh faces a number of critical challenges, including: competition among different water-using sub-sectors; poor irrigation and water&#13;
     management practices and instruments; low use of modern technologies; low technical and managerial capacity in water-sector institutions; lack of coordinated&#13;
     integrated water resources management (IWRM); and a need to improve the knowledge base, management practices, operation and management of the existing&#13;
     irrigation and water infrastructure. The Andhra Pradesh Water Sector Improvement Project addresses these challenges. Under the project, the Government of Andhra&#13;
     Pradesh has chosen the multipurpose Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme to modernize and introduce modern water management practices and instruments. The scheme&#13;
     provides water to irrigate about 1 million-hectare area as well as for other uses, and represents a variety of management challenges in the irrigation/water sector.&#13;
     The project development objectives are to: (i) improve irrigation service delivery on a sustainable basis to increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture in the&#13;
     Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme; and (ii) strengthen the stateâ&#128;&#153;s institutional capacity for multi-sectoral planning, development, and management of its water resources. The&#13;
     project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improving irrigation service delivery in Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme: Supports five sub-components in the Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme, which has a command area&#13;
          of about 0.9 million hectare. These are: (i) participatory rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation system; (ii) dam safety works; (iii) fostering and capacity&#13;
          building of water user organizations; (iv) improved water management practices; and (v) social and environmental management plan.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Irrigated agriculture intensification and diversification: Supports the following six sub-components in the Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme: (i) field crops; (ii) horticulture&#13;
          crops; (iii) livestock production; (iv) fish production; (v) adaptive research; and (vi) market-led extension.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Water sector institutional restructuring and capacity building: Supports: (i) establishing, operationalizing, and fostering the Andhra Pradesh Water Resources&#13;
          Regulatory Commission; (ii) restructuring and capacity building of the Irrigation and Command Area Development Department; (iii) strengthening and capacity&#13;
          building of the Water and Land Management Training And Research Institute; (iv) creating an integrated computerized information system; (v) launching a user-&#13;
          centered aquifer level ground water management pilot; and (vi) conjunctive use of surface and ground water pilots in Nagarjuna Sagar Scheme.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project Management: Supports activities under three sub-components: (i) project preparation and management; (ii) project monitoring and evaluation; and (iii)&#13;
          information, education, and communication program.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     In its third year of implementation, the project is yielding good results. There is an increase in the availability of irrigated water due to improvement in conveyance&#13;
     efficiency.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Water use efficiency increased from 132.5 hectares (ha)/million cubic meters (mcm) (baseline value) to 156.4 ha/mcm.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Paddy yields increased from 2.49 tons/ha to 3.47 tons/ha, maize from 2.37 tons/ha to 4.43 tons/ha, and chilies from 2.89 tons/ha to 3.75 tons/ha.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The diversification of crops has also been observed; 2.2 percent of cropped area diversified from traditional paddy to the higher value crops of maize, cotton,&#13;
          chilies, vegetables, and fodder.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Government of Andhra Pradesh created a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department (RWSSD) in 2007 to focus and expand RWSS coverage across the state.&#13;
At project start, about 46 percent of the rural habitations in Andhra Pradesh (rural population 55 million) were fully covered, with access to 40 litres per capita per day&#13;
of water, and about 54 percent of rural households had individual toilets. The state is keen to gradually decentralize service delivery, while building the capacity of the&#13;
local governments, or Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs). The project was designed to: (i) assist the state in building capacity to pursue its goal of increasing decentralized&#13;
service delivery systems in the water and sanitation sectors; and (ii) scale up a demand-responsive approach with policy principles consistent with national policies. The&#13;
project builds on the accumulated experience and lessons learned from Bank projects in India and across the world.&#13;
&#13;
The project supports RWSS programs in six districts of Andhra Pradesh, and helps them adopt a common RWSS program and policies. The project, through&#13;
improvements in RWSS service delivery and sustainability of assets, will contribute to achieving goal seven of the MDGs on sustainable access to safe drinking water&#13;
and basic sanitation.&#13;
The project objective is to assist the state government to improve rural water supply and sanitation services through progressive decentralization, community&#13;
participation, and enhanced accountability. The project components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity and sector development: Supports building institutional capacity for implementing, managing, and sustaining project activities, along with sector-&#13;
     development studies to inform policy decisions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Infrastructure development: Supports improvements in water supply and sanitation services in the project habitations through new infrastructure or rehabilitat-&#13;
     ing and augmenting existing schemes, integrated with source-strengthening measures and sanitation programs. The project aims to cover 2,600 habitations&#13;
     across 6 districts.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project implementation support: Supports setting up a project support unit for implementing the project, including establishing the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
     (M&amp;E) and sector information systems.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    1.26 million people are benefiting from access to improved water service.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    4,200 toilets were built in project habitations, benefitting about 21,000 people..&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Assam is one of the lower income states of India, and the gateway to the landlocked northeast region of the country. Its road network therefore has significant strategic&#13;
     importance for the economic integration of the lagging northeast with the rest of the country. About 60 percent Assamâ&#128;&#153;s 38,000-km state road network, managed&#13;
     by its Public Works Roads Department (PWRD), is in poor condition due to years of low investment and lack of maintenance. Overall weak sector management has&#13;
     further aggravated the impact of sector underfunding. The PWRD needs substantial enhancements and revisions in its traditional way of doing business to improve its&#13;
     relatively low performance and institutional effectiveness. The Assam State Roads Project will carry forward and build on many sector reforms already introduced in the&#13;
     PWRD since 2000 through Bank-funded Rural Development Projects.&#13;
&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to enhance the road connectivity of Assam by assisting the PWRD in improving and effectively managing its road network. The&#13;
     project has three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road improvement: Improves 500 km of priority sections of the secondary roads to enhance state connectivity and facilitate regional integration. This includes&#13;
          a demonstration of new technologies to promote cost-effective, climate-resilient, and environmentally friendly road construction, including innovative bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road-sector modernization and performance enhancement: Supports the implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan covering: (i) modernization of&#13;
          policies, engineering practices, and business procedures; (ii) asset management and maintenance; (iii) institutional and human resource development including&#13;
          development of local construction industry; and (iv) streamlining, standardizing, and computerizing PWRD key business processes.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety management: Supports building the road safety management capacity of related agencies through the development and implementation of a multi-&#13;
          sector road safety strategy.&#13;
     The project seeks to complement traditional road investments with technical assistance and knowledge to improve overall road sector management in Assam. This will&#13;
     help transform the PWRD into a modern road agency that adopts good practices in sector policies, strategic planning, and project and asset management. Bank support&#13;
     will leverage more than 10 ongoing road development programs; by addressing key sector issues such as maintenance, it will increase the impact of investments&#13;
     made under other road programs.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     The project will help the Government of Assam bring better roads to 4.5 million rural people, mostly marginal and small farmers. It will also bring direct local&#13;
     employment for about 20 million â&#128;&#156;person days.â&#128;&#157; Key expected results include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    An improved maintenance system and an additional $50 million for road maintenance through the Road Maintenance Fund. Annual maintenance contracts are&#13;
          under implementation in five districts and are being scaled up to 17 districts out of 22.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Expected savings of about $100 million per annum on fuel for the state, and avoidance of a potential loss of about $500 million annually in road asset value&#13;
          through effective asset management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Helping the PWRD computerize business processesâ&#128;&#148;a web-based e-portal is to be launched from May 2014. The state government has set-up Assam Road Re-&#13;
          search and Training Institute to implement a comprehensive professional development strategy aiming at providing two weeks of professional training to each&#13;
          staff per year. PWRD is developing innovative bridge designs to save both costs and construction time for construction of about 3,000 bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    An increase in the percentage of secondary road network in good and fair condition from 25 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    A 20 percent reduction in travel time on the project corridors.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    An increase in the safety rating of the project corridors from 10 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved asset management will be introduced in 50 percent of districts. .&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Bihar is one of the poorest states in India. Per capita income is about one-third of the national average. Of its 103 million population, 90 percent live in rural areas.&#13;
Agriculture and allied activities employ 80 percent of Biharâ&#128;&#153;s labor force but contribute only about 20 percent to the state GDP. Its human development indicators are&#13;
among the lowest in India.&#13;
&#13;
The project seeks to strengthen Biharâ&#128;&#153;s Panchayati Raj institutions as units of self-governance capable of planning and implementing development schemes, promoting&#13;
community life, and generating employment opportunities. The project supports the Government of Biharâ&#128;&#153;s plans for strengthening the institutional framework for the&#13;
functioning of Gram Panchayats, or village councils, and bringing about visible changes in village sanitation, quality of drinking water, nutritional status of children,&#13;
and generating employment opportunities through better management of natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to â&#128;&#156;support Biharâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to promote and strengthen inclusive, responsive, and accountable Gram Panchayats in selected&#13;
districts across the state.â&#128;&#157; The project has five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Construction of Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans (local self-government offices).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building for Panchayati Raj institutions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening the state governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Panchayat performance grant.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management and coordination.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increased number of elected representatives trained to perform their mandated role effectively.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    More villagers from socially disadvantaged groups (Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women) attending and participating actively in regular Gram Sabha&#13;
     meetings in project districts.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increased number of Gram Panchayat Standing Committees that meet regularly to discharge their statutory functions and those focusing on planning and bud-&#13;
     geting of various programs.&#13;

&#13;
 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
 In Bihar, Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s second poorest state, per capita income was just a quarter of the national average. Almost 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas with limited&#13;
 opportunities for self-employment, and little access to basic services. Although agriculture was the mainstay of the economy and employed over 80 percent of the population,&#13;
 the vast majority of farmers survived at or near subsistence levels. Without an adequate banking network, most poor people had to borrow from extortionist moneylenders,&#13;
 or from relatives and friends to meet family expenses, often pawning tiny plots of land to repay old debts. Growing landlessness and the lack of livelihood opportunities led&#13;
 to large out-migration from the state. Earlier efforts by the Bihar government to promote the social and economic mobilization of the poor had been thwarted by entrenched&#13;
 caste identities and the absence of sensitive support and facilitation. The additional financing supports the geographical expansion of the project to cover all the stateâ&#128;&#153;s blocks&#13;
 in the existing six districts of the project and support consolidating and scaling up pilot activities undertaken in the parent project. It will also scale up activities to promote&#13;
 greater social accountability and increase the impact of last-mile service delivery approaches using the institutional platform of community-based organizations already&#13;
 formed. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to enhance social and economic empowerment of the rural poor in Bihar. It has four components:&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Community institution development: Builds/strengthens primary and federated social and economic community institutions.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Community Investment Fund: Involves transferring financial and technical resources to the community-based organizations on a demand-driven basis as a catalyst to&#13;
       improve livelihoods.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Technical Assistance Fund: Improves quantity and quality of service provision by public, cooperative, community, and private service providers. The fund will also be used&#13;
       to improve the supply of key support services for the community organizations and federations in the areas of institution building, finance, and livelihoods enhancement.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Project management: Facilitates overall co-ordination, implementation, financial management, and monitoring and learning of the project at state and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
 KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      Mobilized 1.13 million poor women into 93,000 self-help groups (SHGs) and 5,700 village organizations. SHGs have saved over $9.5 million, and made $13.9 million&#13;
        in loans to each other, to help create credit histories with commercial banks, and the project has facilitated SHGsâ&#128;&#153; access to $56 million in bank credit.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      The Bihar Innovation Forum II identified 67 social enterprises (out of 500 applicants) across eight sub-sectors (agriculture, livestock, financial services, rural energy,&#13;
        health services, ICT based solutions, skills &amp; non-farm and entitlements) and 16 grassroots innovators (out of 1,700 applicants) for possible partnerships with the project.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      300,000 farmers have accessed agriculture productivity enhancement interventions, nearly 16,000 households have increased their price realization through the proj-&#13;
        ectâ&#128;&#153;s dairy intervention, and 15,700 youth have been linked to formal sector jobs.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      102 village organizations are managing a public distribution system (PDS) intervention to ensure access to food entitlements.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      More than 30,000 households have accessed entitlements, such as pensions, health insurance and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act&#13;
        (MGNREGAâ&#128;&#148;a national work guarantee scheme).&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      An independent impact evaluation based on a survey of 4,000 households shows that the project has increased the savings, reduced high cost indebtedness, and led to&#13;
        increased food security, and increased womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      An additional 1 million households will be mobilized into 100,000 SHGs. These households are expected to access nearly $60 million from the Community Investment&#13;
        Fund (CIF), and $60 million from commercial banks. It is expected that at least 50 percent of SHG members who receive CIF funds will increase their incomes ay at least&#13;
        30 percent from the baseline.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;      Mobilized 700 producer organizations accounting for 35,000 households across agriculture, dairy and poultry sectors; backyard poultry intervention scaled up already&#13;
        from 5,000 to 30,000 households.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Bihar is Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s third largest state with a population of 103 million people, of which approximately 54 million live below the poverty line. While significant resources&#13;
are provided for social protection programs, the programs fall short of their poverty reduction potential. Program coverage is low and insufficient to address deprivation&#13;
and poverty in Bihar due to large human resource and technical capacity gaps. Delivery mechanisms for awareness generation, enrollment, beneficiary management&#13;
and benefit payments are inefficient, and certain groups (i.e., older people, widows, and people with disabilities) are underserved as social care service provision is&#13;
practically absent. Existing monitoring and evaluation systems do not provide adequate support for planning and decision making and there is poor accountability in&#13;
service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to strengthen institutional capacity of the Department of Social Welfare and the Rural Development Department to deliver social&#13;
protection programs and services and expand outreach of social care services for poor and vulnerable households, people with disabilities, the elderly, and widows.&#13;
The project has two components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening social protection systems and capacity: Setting up core systems and building capacity of the Bihar Rural Development Society (BRDS) and the State&#13;
     Society for Ultra-Poor and Social Welfare (SSUPSW), which are the program implementation arms of the Rural Development Department and the Department of&#13;
     Social Welfare, respectively, to deliver key social-protection programs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening outreach and social protection service delivery: Financing construction, equipment, and staff for 101 social care service centers across all sub-&#13;
     divisions of the state to provide high-quality care, support, and rehabilitation services for older people, widows and the disabled. The component also supports&#13;
     pilots to improve outreach through mobile therapy services and tests models of community-based rehabilitation as well as innovative proposals to further&#13;
     improve social services.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Twenty percent increase in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Indira Awaas Yojana coverage, a 50 percent increase in coverage&#13;
     of social care services, as measured by number of program beneficiaries, and a 25 percent increase in share of vulnerable groups in total beneficiaries of social&#13;
     protection programs and services.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Twenty five percent increase in resources available for social protection programs, as measured by the percent of funds drawn from central resource.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Forty percent improvement in quality and satisfaction with social protection service delivery, as measured by the percent of eligible population aware and percent&#13;
     of beneficiaries reporting satisfaction with services&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The project supports Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in piloting new conservation models that look beyond protected areas, and recognize the need&#13;
     for innovative solutions to biodiversity loss through improved coordination, capacity building, awareness generation, reskilling, and convergence of actions. Given the&#13;
     pace of land use changes and growing population pressure on protected areas, there is a real danger that the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services could reach a&#13;
     tipping point, at which there will be a failure to supply key inputs for sustaining economic growth. Coupled with this is the fact that over 100 million people are directly&#13;
     dependent on biodiversity resources for subsistence.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to develop and promote new models of conservation at the landscape scale through enhanced capacity and institution-building&#13;
     for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation outcomes. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Demonstration of landscape conservation approaches in two pilot sites: Investments in planning, coordination, and convergence through innovative microplans&#13;
          at the village level and landscape mapping; includes limited investments in improving habitat quality.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening knowledge management and national capacity for landscape conservation: Development of a curriculum for a national-level landscape manage-&#13;
          ment courseâ&#128;&#148;strengthening three field learning centers for translating best practices in conservation management into training modules, and carrying out&#13;
          national-level training sessions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Scaling up and replicating successful models of conservation in additional landscape sites: Two new sites will be added this year to further scale up the landscape&#13;
          approach model.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    National coordination for landscape conservation: Supports a project management unit at the MoEF for coordinating among all six implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development outcomes will be measured by the following performance indicators:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The successful adoption of the landscape approach in two sites.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Development and adoption of an Institutional and Methodological Framework for Landscape Conservation Approach.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved management of at least 600,000 hectares of protected areas within landscapes.&#13;
     The project is expected to lead to an increased natural resource base, reduced dependence on protected areas, and improvement in community livelihoods through&#13;
     the sustainable use of biodiversity resources, as well as converging with other programs. It will support the preparation and implementation of village microplans and&#13;
     track benefits accrued to beneficiaries, including women.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
On August 18, 2008, the Kosi River burst through its eastern embankment 11 km upstream of the Kosi Barrage in Nepal, 8 km north of the Indian border. This created&#13;
major flooding in Nepal and in the Indian state of Bihar, with about 3.3 million people affected in Bihar alone. The Kosi floods were subsequently declared a national&#13;
calamity by the Government of India.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective of Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery Project is to support flood recovery and risk reduction efforts in the affected regions through: (i)&#13;
reconstruction of damaged houses and road infrastructure; (ii) strengthening the flood management capacity in the Kosi Basin; (iii) enhancing the livelihood&#13;
opportunities of the affected people; and (iv) improving the emergency response capacity for future disasters. The project comprises five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Owner-driven housing reconstruction&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Reconstruction of roads and bridges&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening flood management capacity&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Livelihood support and enhancement&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Contingency fund&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management and implementation support&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Of the proposed 100,000 houses to be reconstructed, the beneficiary list for 65,000 has been finalized and the process of allocating funds to beneficiaries has&#13;
     been initiated. Currently, over 52,000 beneficiaries have been given their first instalment of housing assistance, and over 16,800 homes have been completed.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    All 70 bridges and 37 roads are awarded and construction begun. Twenty six bridges and two road works are complete.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The project has helped substantially mobilize community institutions and their capitalization. It has enabled community institutions to leverage considerable&#13;
     credit from commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:&#13;
The Government of Bihar set up the Bihar Aapada Punarwas Evam Purarnirman Society for implementing the project. Other state agencies, such as Rural Works, Road&#13;
Construction, and Water Resources departments, are also involved.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     India is undergoing a massive rural-urban transformation. The share of the Indian population living in urban areas is expected to increase from one-third to half&#13;
     the population in the next 20 years. Already, the number of towns in India has jumped from about 5,000 in 2001 to 8,000 in 2011. In addition to this spatial&#13;
     transformation, India is undergoing an institutional transformation with local governments playing a greater role in service delivery and urban management. Although&#13;
     the process of decentralization was initiated two decades ago with the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, the transfer of resources and responsibilities to the&#13;
     local governments is still a work in progress.&#13;
&#13;
     The launch of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in December 2005 by the Government of India signaled the increased importance of&#13;
     the urban sector in the political agenda. The total budgeted amount was Rs. 50,000 Cr. (more than $11 billion in 2005) for the 2005-2012 period to finance city-level&#13;
     investments in infrastructure and housing. There is consensus that lack of capacity at the local level is a major constraint affecting not only the day-to-day management&#13;
     of urban areas but also the ability of cities to absorb technical and financial assistance from the central and state governments.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to assist the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA)&#13;
     in improving the systems and skills of select ULBs with respect to urban management and urban poverty reduction, as well as to support the two ministriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
     implementation of various urban policy and institutional reforms. The project has three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building for strengthened urban management: This component is implemented by the MoUD, and supports technical assistance to ULBs to improve&#13;
          systems for: (i) financial management; (ii) urban planning; (iii) service delivery; and (iv) governance. ULBs select the desired package of assistance based on an&#13;
          assessment of needs which is undertaken with support from the project management unit. This demand-driven menu approach is in response to the variable&#13;
          capacity building needs faced by ULBs. The component also supports strengthening the MoUDâ&#128;&#153;sinistry capacity for policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building for effective urban poverty alleviation and monitoring: This component is implemented by the MoHUPA and supports activities including: (i)&#13;
          administering and operating a challenge fund for urban poverty alleviation; (ii) creating a network of practitioners from among the ULBs participating in the&#13;
          challenge fund to promote information sharing and capacity building in urban poverty alleviation; and (iii) strengthening of selected sector institutionsâ&#128;&#153; capacity&#13;
          and strengthening of the MoHUPAâ&#128;&#153;s capacity for policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation Support: This component supports a national project management unit for providing overall technical and managerial assistance to the MoUD&#13;
          and MoHUPA during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     Twenty participating ULBs will have implemented at least two urban management reforms in the areas covered under the technical assistance:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Financial management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Urban planning&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India generates 4.4 million tons of hazardous waste per year, with a large percentage of it illegally dumped outside industrial estates, on abandoned public lands,&#13;
and within privately owned lands. Despite amendment of national legislation, compliance is low and the data is deficient on illegal dumps and hazardous-waste&#13;
generation and characterization. Demand for land due to rapidly increasing urbanization is resulting in use and redevelopment of former industrial land or dump&#13;
sites, which are at the margins of fast expanding cities. Since most of these â&#128;&#156;brownfield landsâ&#128;&#157; are potentially contaminated with industrial waste, resulting in chemical&#13;
pollution of soil, surface, and ground waste, such contaminated waste sites have the potential to pose significant health risk to communities and exposed individuals,&#13;
especially poor and marginalized communities located on the fringes of urban areas. India needed the support to develop the tools and methodologies for human&#13;
health risk assessments and the capacity to evaluate the technical, economic, legal, social, and environmental feasibility of remediation of contaminated sites.&#13;
The project development objective is to: (i) build tangible human and technical capacity in selected state agencies for undertaking environmentally sound remediation&#13;
of polluted sites; (ii) support the development of a policy, institutional, and methodological framework for the establishment of a National Program for Rehabilitation&#13;
of Polluted Sites (NPRPS). The project is targeting sites in Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Project components cover:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening of environmental institutions: Building capacity for addressing pollution remediation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Investments in priority remediation and environmental improvements: Rehabilitation of orphan hazardous waste sites and municipal dumpsites. Four pilot&#13;
     projects (two each in Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal) will demonstrate sound remediation technologies for Orphan Hazardous Waste and Municipal Solid&#13;
     Waste Disposal sites.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Develop NPRRS using risks assessment methodology for prioritizing polluted sites, supported by public consultations. The three baseline studies to develop&#13;
     NPRPS (inventory, methodology and policy for remediation) are in the advanced stages and are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Develop guidelines and standards for remediation to be adopted by participating states and the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Establish Environmental Compliance Assistance Center (ECAC) to promote measures for voluntary industrial compliance business plans for setting up the ECACs,&#13;
     procurement in the two states, and capacity-building activities are in the final stages of completion.&#13;
Pilots for remediation using area based approach are ready for implementation, including pollution profiling and mapping, indicators, detailed engineering plan,&#13;
monitoring, and after-care program. Project implementing agencies have hired international consultants to develop detailed remedial plans for the four pilot sites and&#13;
the plans for three sites have already been completed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s current installed power generation capacity stands at more than 223 GW. Fifty-eight percent (130 GW) is coal fired, and contributes to about 83 percent of&#13;
     the total actual generation. In the 12th Five-Year Plan of the Government of India, over 80 percent of the generation addition is planned to come under coal-based&#13;
     power plants. According to the Planning Commissionâ&#128;&#153;s Integrated Energy Policy, coal will remain Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s primary energy source, accounting for nearly 42 percent&#13;
     of total energy consumption and 65 percent of electricity generation in the next 25 years. Many coal-fired power plants, however, do not operate efficiently, and&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s renovation and modernization investments have not kept pace with targets; plants that account for almost 27 GW of capacity urgently need to be renovated&#13;
     and modernized. Focusing on existing plants rather than building new ones is a good opportunity to add low-cost power to Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s starving grid, while improving&#13;
     operational efficiencies relatively quickly. The approach also means dealing with fewer challenges such as availability of land, existence of transmission lines, and&#13;
     availability of fuel and water linkages.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank-supported Coal Fired Generation Rehabilitation Project is helping the Government of India design and implement an appropriately sequenced program&#13;
     to scale up the Energy-Efficient Renovation and Modernization (EE R&amp;M) of its old, inefficient, and polluting coal-fired power generation capacity. This would help&#13;
     put the sector on a lower carbon path than continuing to operate these plants at their present efficiency levels, while also bridging the power demand-supply gap.&#13;
     Recognizing the large carbon emission reduction potential of this project, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided a $45.4 million grant.&#13;
&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to improve energy efficiency of selected coal-fired power generation units through renovation and modernization and improved&#13;
     operations and maintenance. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s two components focus on:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Energy efficiency renovation and modernization pilots to renovate and modernize 640 MW of old coal-fired power generation capacity to demonstrate energy-&#13;
          efficient rehabilitation approaches.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance to support the implementation of pilots, develop a pipeline of pilot interventions, address barriers to energy efficient renovation and mod-&#13;
          ernization projects, and strengthen institutional capacities of implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     While this pilot project is targeting 640 MW for EE R&amp;M, its success could result in the Government of India and various states rehabilitating capacity of identified&#13;
     similar plants. The project is expected to have an impact on:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Barrier reduction strategy for wider replication of rehabilitation projects: This attempts to address barriers to rehabilitation in the selected pilot states through&#13;
          studies backed with international experiences, policy/regulatory dialogue, and strengthening of institutional capacity. In addition, the project has also helped&#13;
          mobilize qualified contractors to bid on Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s EE R&amp;M opportunities and will demonstrate effective R&amp;M approaches which can be replicated across the country&#13;
          (and possibly elsewhere) once completed successfully.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Quick and low-cost option for augmentation of power supply: Given the significant gap between demand and supply of power in India, these pilots will demon-&#13;
          strate whether and how the rehabilitation of old coal-fired power plants can augment availability of power on competitive terms.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening institutional capacity of utilities: The engagement with selected state utilities is helping them build institutional capacity, especially in the areas of&#13;
          design and execution of R&amp;M projects, and efficient operation and management (O&amp;M) of plants.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improving environmental performance of the plants: In addition to reducing carbon emissions from power plants, the project would support improving the&#13;
          overall environmental performance of these plants, including particulates emission, water treatment, ash disposal, and overall safeguards practices and policies&#13;
          in the plant â&#128;&#147; areas that sometimes do not attract adequate the attention of the utility.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India has over 5,000 large dams that are essential for water storage to cater to Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s increasingly competitive use of scarce water resources. There is limited scope for&#13;
building new dams, however, since all easy dam sites are already in use, acquiring land is difficult, and construction costs are very high. Many existing dams are under&#13;
distress, and the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) is designed to implement innovative solutions to again allow for the optimal use of the existing&#13;
223 dams covered by the project.&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams in the states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,&#13;
and Tamil Nadu. The project has two major components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Rehabilitation and improvement of dams and associated appurtenances: Comprehensive rehabilitation and improvement of 223 dam and appurtenant struc-&#13;
      tures in the project states. In addition, hydrological assessments, preparation of asset management plans and emergency preparedness plans, development of&#13;
      emergency warning systems, public awareness campaigns, and floodplain mapping will be carried out.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Dam safety institutional strengthening: To support and strengthen the Dam Safety Organization (DSO) at the national level in the Central Water Commission and&#13;
      DSOs and Water Resources Departments in each of the four participating states, as well as the State Electricity Boards in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. DSOs will become&#13;
      effective organizations that can take the lead in overseeing that dams remain safe from a structural and operational point of view. Dam managers will be assisted&#13;
      with the development of appropriate skills and modern tools to adequately operate and maintain dams.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The main results expected at the end of the project include:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     223 project dams with the ability to safely deal with recurrent floods, and with acceptable stability and seepage; 223 fully operational dams, with reduced risk&#13;
      of failure.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     150 project dams with need-based operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) plans implemented, and with at least 80 percent of the required annual budget for O&amp;M&#13;
      allocated.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     60 dams where emergency response plans have been prepared and disseminated to the population.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Indian Railways (IR) operates a national rail network of about 64,600 route-kilometers. In 2011-12, it carried 8.2 billion passengers and 969 million tonnes of freight.&#13;
     Despite strong growth in its freight business, IR has been losing market share to road haulage, due partly to insufficient physical capacity and poor service quality&#13;
     exacerbated by the need to fit freight train movements into a busy passenger service schedule. Without additional rail network capacity, much of the traffic for which&#13;
     rail should have competitive advantage would be forced to use road haulage or be suppressed, in both cases at a cost to the economy and in the former case at an&#13;
     environmental cost as well. Over the last decade, IR has successfully adopted many management measures to squeeze more capacity from its existing assets; average&#13;
     trainload, equipment utilization, and railway labor productivity have all been greatly improved. Physical capacity on key corridors is now the most pressing constraint.&#13;
&#13;
     The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) project is a strategic response to network constraints on critical freight routes in India that form a quadrilateral, connecting Delhi,&#13;
     Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. The rail network between these cities accounts for just 16 percent of IRâ&#128;&#153;s route network by length, but carries more than 60 percent of&#13;
     its freight traffic. With Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s freight traffic projected to grow at more than 7 percent annually, the DFC program will add dedicated freight-only lines, mostly parallel&#13;
     to the existing routes, built at higher loading standards to permit the operation of larger and heavier axle-load trains. This will not only double the overall rail capacity&#13;
     in the corridors, but also significantly reduce train operating costs per unit of freight. The current DFC program includes the Western Corridor (Delhi-Mumbai) and the&#13;
     Eastern Corridor (Ludhiana-Delhi-Kolkata). The Ministry of Railways (MoR) is the designated responsible ministry and the shareholder of the Dedicated Freight Corridor&#13;
     Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL).&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank is supporting implementation of a substantial portion of the Eastern DFC under a three phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The APL-I is for a 343-km&#13;
     section from Khurja to Kanpur, entirely in the state of Uttar Pradesh. APLâ&#128;&#147;II, currently under preparation, will cover about 390 km from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai, again&#13;
     entirely in Uttar Pradesh. The development objectives of the APL-I are to: (i) provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality, and higher freight&#13;
     throughput on the 343-km Khurja to Kanpur section of the Eastern rail corridor; and (ii) develop the institutional capacity of DFCCIL to build and operate the DFC&#13;
     network. The APL Phase 1 project consists of two components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Design, construction, and commissioning of the Khurja-Kanpur section: Supports the construction of 343 km of double track electrified railway capable of freight&#13;
          train operation with 25-ton axle loads at 100 km/hour.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional development: Supports (i) institutional strengthening of DFCCIL; and (ii) heavy-haul freight systems development.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Additional freight train paths on the DFC will increase by 100 pairs per day.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Average speed of freight trains on the DFC will increase from a baseline of 25 km/hour in 2011 to 60 km/hour by the end of the project.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Rail transport capacity on the DFC will increase from 18 to 29.5 Net Tonne Kilometer (NTKM) bn ton-km.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    DFCCIL institutional capacity will increase with the addition of 9,800 staff, of which 1,210 will be from the officer cadre.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. World Bank support for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor&#13;
(EDFC) was conceived as a series of projects in which the three sections (total length 1,133 km) would be delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in&#13;
their construction schedules. The first loan (as first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan called EDFC 1) was approved by the Board in May 2011 and is now under&#13;
implementation. This project, EDFC 2, supports the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s effort to construct 393 km of the EDFC from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai in Uttar Pradesh. The&#13;
project includes the most heavily congested sections of the corridor, and connects ports and mining areas in the East to consumption centers in the Northwest of the&#13;
country. It is a top development priority of the government, as rail traffic levels in the main transport corridors are already at or exceed their nominal capacity.&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objectives are to: (i) provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality and higher freight throughout on the 393-km&#13;
Kanpur-Mughal Sarai section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor; and (ii) develop institutional capacity of the DFCCIL to build, maintain, and operate the entire&#13;
rail freight network. It has two components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Design, construction and commissioning of the Kanpur-Mughal Sarai section of the EDFC consisting of 393 km of double-track electrified railway designed for&#13;
     freight-only train operations with 25-ton axle-loads (upgradable to 32.5 ton axle loads) at 100 km/hour.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Continue providing institutional support to assist DFCCIL to develop its capability to best utilize heavy-haul freight rail systems.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
Progress toward the achievement of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective will be measured by three indicators:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Number of additional train paths produced on the EDFC.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Volume of freight carried.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved institutional capacity of DFCCIL.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Recurrent and severe electricity shortages (peak power deficit of 9.0 percent and energy deficit of 8.7 percent in 2013) have imposed high costs on the Indian economy.&#13;
In addition, the poor technical and commercial performance of most of the state electricity providers has led to a loss of $20 billion during 2011-12, according to the&#13;
India Power Sector Review Study (2013). This bleak scenario is compounded by the fact that more than 350 million people in India today still lack access to electricity,&#13;
impeding their ability to fully benefit from a growing economy. Furthermore, Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s power sector also relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily coal), and the country is&#13;
currently the worldâ&#128;&#153;s fourth largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. To address these issues, the Government of India plans to: (i) expand generation by using renewable&#13;
energy sources whenever feasible and strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate energy exchange across regions; (ii) improve energy efficiency and&#13;
performance of institutions in the power sector; and (iii) expand access for rural and peri-urban populations.&#13;
The Fifth Power System Project builds on a successful partnership with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), the national electricity transmission&#13;
company that is vital to the development of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s power sector. Not only has the WBG financed POWERGRIDâ&#128;&#153;s investment programs (through four direct loans), but&#13;
it has also supported its ongoing efforts to achieve world class operations and management, and to leverage private participation (including with IFC financing of&#13;
the Bhutan-India Tala transmission system). WBGâ&#128;&#153;s support to this project came in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, when both international and domestic&#13;
credit markets became severely constrained. In India, the cost of debt for domestic investors increased by at least 20 to 30 percent, and the availability of both debt&#13;
and risk capital for infrastructure projects decreased. Additional financing to POWERGRID was also part of broader efforts to scale-up IBRD financing in response to the&#13;
financial crisis.&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to strengthen Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s electricity transmission system in the Western, Northern, and Southern regions to increase reliable power&#13;
exchange between regions and states. Investments under the project will help improve POWERGRIDâ&#128;&#153;s service delivery by facilitating more economic use of generation&#13;
resources; providing greater grid stability; and facilitating development of a power trading regime within the country and with Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s neighbors. The government is&#13;
also encouraging private financing in the sector. To this end, the WBG has been working with POWERGRID to explore options for leveraging finance from international&#13;
markets, with the deployment of IFC-syndicated loan instruments (transaction completed in June 2012), and the possible use of an IBRD Partial Credit Guarantee&#13;
whereby POWERGRID will access the international loan markets for the first time and on its own credit.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Annual inter-regional power exchange is up to 78,384 mega units (MU), surpassing original and recently original (58,000 MU) and recently revised (68,000&#13;
     MU). Targets.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Transmission capacity of the Central Transmission Utility of India has exceeded 106,000-circuit km, outperforming original end-of-project targets.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Transformation capacity increased significantly from a baseline of 75,000 megavolt ampheres (MVA) to more than 205,000 MVA, outperforming end-of-project&#13;
     targets.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Inter-regional electric power transfer capacity increased from less than 21 to 31 gigawatts since 2008-09, and since January 1, 2014, the entire transmission&#13;
     system has been operating as one of the largest synchronous grids in the world.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     India has large infrastructure financing needs: the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s estimate for the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) alone is $1 trillion, half of which is expected&#13;
     to be raised from private sources. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s objective is to strengthen IIFCLâ&#128;&#153;s capacity for infrastructure public-private partnership financing through piloting new&#13;
     instruments and implementation approaches to increase the availability of long-term financing for infrastructure PPP projects in India. The coverage of the project is&#13;
     intended to be national.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     Project progress had been very slow. Consequently the project was restructured in December 2013 to appropriately size the project allocation, allow for innovative&#13;
     financial products that build IIFCLâ&#128;&#153;s financial capacity and use new implementation approaches that rely more substantively on IIFCLâ&#128;&#153;s operational capacity, which has&#13;
     evolved substantively over the last few years. Disbursement so far is $65 million, out of an allocation of $195 million for one power transmission project and one solar&#13;
     power project. Other roads and port terminal projects are in the pipeline. The capacity-building component of the project has made better progress and additional&#13;
     resources have been allocated recently to support implementation of the restructured project and scale up capacity building efforts. Recent achievement include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Cumulative amount of take-out financing provided by IIFCL is currently at $1.2 billion against a $1.7 billion target.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Number of eligible infrastructure projects that receive Bank financing support through IIFCL increased from baseline of 1 to 7 by end June 2014.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Percent of loans disbursed through IIFCL to selected infrastructure sub-projects increased from a baseline of 2 percent in March 2013 to 33 percent in June 2014.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector is facing high and rising energy costs, unlike other sectors of the economy such as agriculture that&#13;
benefit from subsidized energy prices. Many Indian MSMEs are energy-intensive, employing inefficient and outmoded technologies. Investments in cost-effective&#13;
energy-efficiency measures would improve their productivity and bottom-line profits. The barriers to adopting energy efficiency measures typically include access to&#13;
finance, a gap in understanding between energy auditors and energy-efficiency practitioners and local banks, higher transaction costs for preparing energy-efficiency&#13;
proposals, and imperfect information. MSMEs are also generally unfamiliar with the performance of readily available efficient equipment. The project development&#13;
objective is to increase demand for energy efficiency investments in target MSME clusters, and to build their capacity to access commercial finance. The project has&#13;
four components, focusing on five MSME industrial clusters:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increasing awareness of energy efficiency through outreach efforts, and dissemination of information about successful projects. Increase capacity of energy audi-&#13;
     tors, financial intermediaries, vendors, and MSMEs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Preparation and implementation of 500 energy-efficiency proposals through technical assistance for preparing Investment Grade Detailed Project Reports. That&#13;
     involves detailed energy audits and preparing financing plans, facilitating loans from banks and financial intermediaries, and providing implementation support.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Broad programmatic knowledge management for monitoring and evaluation, collection of best practice examples, dissemination, and policy development func-&#13;
     tions, with the goal of ensuring effective implementation and replication of energy efficiency improvement efforts at MSMEs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation support for the two project management units.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    4.8 million lifetime emission reductions by project end from five project clusters and 26 clusters managed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Emission reductions are about 0.6 million from five clusters and about 2.5 million from 26 clusters (as of March 2014).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    300 Investment Grade Energy-Efficiency Proposals completed out of a target of 500. Of these, implementation of EE measures are completed by 42 units and&#13;
     implementation is ongoing in 158 units. Implementation will start shortly in the rest of 100 MSME units.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    $10 million worth of energy-efficiency investments already achieved with steady progress toward the $46 million end of project target. EE investments com-&#13;
     pleted in 62 units and 166 are ongoing.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    500 energy auditors have already been trained, fully achieving the target.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    2,450 entrepreneurs (including 100 banks and financial intermediaries and 500 MSME units) benefited from outreach activities, surpassing the end-project&#13;
     target of 1,300.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Gujarat has one of the most extensive and traffic-intensive road networks in the country. The stateâ&#128;&#153;s has about 145,000 km of roads, including 3,170 km of national&#13;
     highways, 18,450 km of state highways, and 20,560 km of major district roads. The Roads and Buildings Department (R&amp;BD) has the primary responsibility for&#13;
     managing about 80,000 km of primary road network and 30,000 km of non-plan roads, with higher-level strategic guidance/oversight from the Gujarat Infrastructure&#13;
     Development Board. Despite rapid expansion in the network capacity and quality, owing mainly to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s sustained emphasis on road development, the&#13;
     road sector faces a new set of challenges to keep up with rapidly increasing demand, improve connectivity to the relatively underdeveloped eastern tribal region of the&#13;
     state, and associated financing and safety considerations.&#13;
&#13;
     The main goal of the Gujarat State Highways Project II (GSHP II) is to extend Bank assistance to address these challenges. Because this is a follow-up project in an&#13;
     advanced state, it will place relatively less emphasis on financing civil worksâ&#128;&#148;reflected in smaller loan-size with a higher ratio of counterpart and private fundingâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
     increase focus on finance-plus aspects. For example: (i) new contracting approach to improve investment and operational efficiency by transferring design risks to the&#13;
     contractors, and clubbing maintenance responsibilities for a longer period; (ii) pilot transactions to leverage innovative private sector investment (modified annuity);&#13;
     and (iii) various steps to increase the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s institutional and financial capacity to improve road service and safety in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective&#13;
     manner.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve capacity and enhance the quality and safety of road services for the users of the Core Road Network (CRN) of state&#13;
     highways in Gujarat, through institutional strengthening and efficient contracting and financing strategies. The project is structured around three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Highway improvement includes upgrading about 350 km and rehabilitating 275 km of state highways through a mix of nine performance-based maintenance&#13;
          contracts, one PPP annuity-based Design, Building, Finance, Operate, Maintain and Transfer (DBFOMT) contract and one output and performance-based road&#13;
          contract (OPRC).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Sector policy and institutional development seeks to deepen the GSHP I efforts towards improving R&amp;BDâ&#128;&#153;s operational capacity, and also augment the stateâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          capacity in two more critical areas: policy and planning; and knowledge-building.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety management strengthens the road safety management system and improves capacity to undertake multi-sectoral road safety interventions in the&#13;
          state through a safe corridor demonstration project on two high-volume, high-safety risk corridors, enhancing asset management with safety attributes, and&#13;
          strengthening the Gujarat Road Safety Management System.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     The project would directly improve the condition, capacity and safety of about 625 km of the 6,444-km core state road network. It is expected that this will directly&#13;
     benefit about 38 million local businesses and inhabitants served by the project roads, as well as road users, of whom about half are women. The improved roads will&#13;
     have significantly better capacity and roughness. Travel time should fall by about 30 percent, while the average volume/capacity ratio, a key measure of highway&#13;
     congestion, should decline significantly. The emphasis on road safety ought to help reduce fatalities by 20 percent on the safe demonstration corridor.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The major remaining obstacles to making Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s power sector responsive to the demands of consumers and a modernizing economy are at the state level, predominantly&#13;
in electricity distribution and transmission. By using investment lending to alleviate the infrastructure deficit in a rapidly growing state that also has pockets of poverty,&#13;
the World Bank is drawing on global experience in institutional reform to support electricity improvements in the north Indian state of Haryana.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to improve the availability, efficiency, and accountability of electricity supply in the state of Haryana by strengthening the&#13;
transmission and distribution systems. The project supports HVPN, a transmission company, and DHBVN, a distribution company. It has three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Transmission system strengthening involves priority investments in sub-stations together with transmission lines for system augmentation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Urban distribution system strengthening focuses on improving operational efficiency and enhanced customer service.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance and capacity building of transmission and distribution companies.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The transmission companyâ&#128;&#153;s (HVPN) transformation capacity has increased from baseline 9,700 MVA to about 18,580 MVA, beyond the project end target of&#13;
     16,000 MVA.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Under the project, the corporate governance and financial accountability (CGFA) action plan is modeled on best practice in financial management for public-&#13;
     sector undertakings in India. The CGFA covers accounting, auditing, internal control, budgeting, and reporting, and is currently under implementation in both&#13;
     companies.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Building overall capacity of the Government of Haryana to develop and implement its institutional-building agendaâ&#128;&#148;one that focuses on internal transforma-&#13;
     tion through process improvements, use of technology, and organizational changeâ&#128;&#148;is the most critical part of this project. The implementation strategy aims to&#13;
     increase accountability at all levels of government, and increase efficiency and performance through the formulation of key performance Indicators and a new&#13;
     performance management system.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    More than 60 percent of the distribution companyâ&#128;&#153;s (DHBVN) revenue comes from 3.75 percent (90,623) of consumers who have loads of more than 10 kilowatts&#13;
     (kW). The project provides automated meter readings to 87,000 of these consumers. Automatic meter readings will ensure better revenue and helps detect&#13;
     tampering and theft.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Consultancy support to the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) has helped mainstream safeguard policies and introduced the use of third-party&#13;
     quality assurance consultants, resulting in improved flow of information on good practices in project management, as well as supporting accountability and&#13;
     transparency in transactions.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Himachal Pradesh is a mountain state in northern India and a rich repository of biodiversity, forming the catchment for several major northern Indian rivers. Despite&#13;
     the growing importance of tourism and hydropower, the economy of Himachal Pradesh remains largely agrarian, based on rain-fed crops, horticulture, and livestock.&#13;
     Nine out of 10 households are rural, and most of these live in small settlements, typically located in remote valleys and heavily dependent on forests and community&#13;
     lands for their daily requirements of fuel wood, fodder, and food. Constraints to rural development include rugged topography and poor access to social and economic&#13;
     services, small and fragmented landholdings, fragile soils, and excessive human and livestock population pressure in a highly fragile mountain eco-system. To meet&#13;
     the challenges of poverty reduction and sustainable natural resource management, an integrated approach to watershed development is needed to ensure that land&#13;
     and water resources are sustainably managed and the livelihoods of rural inhabitants enhanced.&#13;
     The World Bank has had a long history with watershed development in the state and the current project aims to scale up the successes of earlier interventions by&#13;
     entrusting a large share of project implementation responsibilities to local governments i.e., Gram Panchayats (GPs). This will help mainstream policies that promote&#13;
     cost-sharing, participation, and effective local governance into state-wide watershed development efforts. The primary objective of the proposed project is to reverse&#13;
     the process of degradation of the natural resource base, and improve the productive potential of natural resources and incomes of the rural households in the project&#13;
     areas. The secondary objective is to support policy and institutional development to harmonize watershed development projects and policies across the State, in&#13;
     accordance with best practices. There are three project components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening: Building capacity of communities and local governments to effectively manage watershed development in a participatory, transpar-&#13;
          ent, and demand-driven manner.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Watershed development and management: Financing of soil and water conservation, non-arable land treatments, crop and livestock production, and rural&#13;
          infrastructure.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Enhancing mountain livelihoods: Promotion of value added in agriculture and income-generating activities, particularly for tribal and vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project has contributed to reverse the process of natural resource degradation by creating an estimated 537,000 cubic meters of water storage. Various water&#13;
          harvesting structures have been developed, including 6,150 water harvesting tanks, 1,500 ponds/tanks, 335 lift/gravity irrigation schemes and 240 km of irriga-&#13;
          tion channels. The benefits from these structures have reached almost 45,000 families.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project has also brought about 7,500 hectares of rain-fed land under irrigation.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    By 2009, there was a reported increase in yields of rice paddy (236 percent), corn (163 percent), and wheat (90 percent), which surpassed the end of-project target&#13;
          of 50 percent. The increase in milk yield was 11 percent. Some 10,000 farmers benefited from cultivating and marketing high-value crops, such as vegetables&#13;
          and spices, instead of traditional crops.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Production and use of vermi-compost (28,000 metric tons annually) enabled organic vegetable cultivation.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project also formed 1,500 farmers into milk federations and established linkages with milk-chilling plants.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Some 12,000 hectares have been forested, with the overall survival rate of these plantations assessed at 73 percent.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Himachal Pradesh is a relatively small state in India both in terms of area and population. The development strategy of the Government of Himachal Pradesh aims to&#13;
progressively raise the standard of living, correct the fiscal imbalance, and stimulate growth. An efficient transport system is necessary to allow for the stateâ&#128;&#153;s planned&#13;
growth. With hardly any rail, no waterways and only three small domestic airports, the state relies almost exclusively on its road network for transport. The total road&#13;
network in the state is about 28,000 km, comprising 2,000 km of national highway border roads financed by the Government of India, 2,160 km of state highways,&#13;
2,240 km of major district roads, with the balance being rural roads. But the quality and extent of this road network is inadequate to meet the social and economic&#13;
needs of the state: only half of all roads are surfaced, 90 percent of the highway network is single lane, and fewer than half of all villages are deemed connected. The&#13;
road sector suffers from low levels of investment. Funding for maintenance has historically been a problem.&#13;
The project development objective is to reduce transport costs and improve traffic flows on priority segments of the Core Road Network of Himachal Pradesh for the&#13;
road users in the state. It has two components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Core network improvement: Upgrading of roads in the core road network, including widening of formation, realignment, new structures, and pavement strength-&#13;
     ening of about 450 km of roads.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Core network maintenance and management: Activities include: (i) periodic maintenance and minor rehabilitation of about 2,000 km of the Core Road Network,&#13;
     in accordance with the agreed environmental measures set forth in the Component 2 environmental management plan; (ii) piloting performance-based mainte-&#13;
     nance contracts; (iii) accident black-spot improvements; (iv) pre-investment studies for road network improvement and maintenance; and (v) capacity enhance-&#13;
     ment in road maintenance, financing, and management.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The percentage of the core network of roads in poor condition decreased from the baseline of 40 percent in 2007 to 33 percent as of end June 2014, with an end&#13;
     project target of less than 10 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    At the end June 2014, the average traffic speed has increased by a more than 25 percent on 307 km of already upgraded roads sections.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The fatal accident rate on the core network reduced from two deaths involved in traffic accidents per 1,000 vehicles in 2007 to 0.24 per 1,000 vehicles by end&#13;
     June 2014.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Level of road user satisfaction on the core network more than doubled (from 1.5 in 2007 to 3.57 in 2014), surpassing the end of project target of 3.0 (Note: using&#13;
     a 1-5 index).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     India has 63 million people living in low-elevation coastal areas, endowed with significant ecological and economic resources. These coastal areas are unable to&#13;
     ensure balanced development due to the increasing threat of hazards on economic and livelihood security; fragmented and weak institutional frameworks; and lack&#13;
     of appropriate knowledge-based decision-making. As a result, coastal and marine resources are depleted and degraded. Unless these resources are conserved as part&#13;
     of overall economic development plans, there will be further impacts on the livelihood, health, and well-being of the coastal population. In 2006, the Government&#13;
     of India adopted the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) approach (a shift from a purely regulatory to a management approach) that would, with peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     participation, promote livelihood security of the coastal communities, protect the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development. In 2007, the government of&#13;
     India requested the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financing to create the initial institutional and knowledge bases to support its long-term reform agenda, and to pilot activities that would&#13;
     inform larger future projects and programs. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project is the largest ever Bank financing in coastal zone projects, and one of&#13;
     the largest ever for knowledge outputs.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to assist the government in building national capacity to implement a comprehensive coastal management approach, and to pilot&#13;
     the ICZM approach in the states of Gujarat, Orissa, and West Bengal. Project components cover:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    National ICZM capacity building aims to establish and support an appropriate national institutional structure for guiding and coordinating coastal zone man-&#13;
          agement. It includes: (i) hazard line and coastal sediment cell mapping; (ii) mapping and management of ecologically sensitive areas; (iii) establishing a new&#13;
          national institute for sustainable coastal zone management; and (iv) national-level capacity building.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Development and implementation of ICZM in the states of Gujarat, Orissa and West Bengal aims to develop and empower state-level authorities to adopt appro-&#13;
          priate ICZM approaches consistent with national strategies. It includes: (i) preparation and adoption of ICZM plans; (ii) institutional strengthening of state-level&#13;
          coastal zone authorities; (iii) pilot investments consistent with local ICZM priorities around three themes of coastal resource conservation/protection; pollution&#13;
          management; and community livelihood enhancement, adapting to threats from sea-level rise.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
     By project end, it is expected that India will have established an appropriate national institutional structure for guiding and coordinating implementation of the ICZM&#13;
     approach. It is expected that the various knowledge products produced under this project (i.e. 10 â&#128;&#156;Knowledge Benchmarksâ&#128;&#157; as well as the 8 pilot ICZM activities) will&#13;
     provide useful lessons and guidance for the development of the overall structure as well as future ICZM interventions.&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s intermediate outcomes include:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    9,000 ha mangrove planted with community involvement.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    78,000 km2 of aerial photography completed.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Several village-level micro projects completed, in particular in sanitation, solar power, power connection, and livelihood improvement.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    First successful â&#128;&#156;technology-agnosticâ&#128;&#157; bid for sewage treatment plant in India with 15 years design-build-operate contract.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Large real-time lake water monitoring system installed in Odisha.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Over 100,000 turtles protected, more than 10,000 hatched and released into the sea.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    First regional coastal process study in South Asia - detailed marine bathymetry completed (Odisha).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    40,000 new non-culturable microbes discovered and meta-gene mapping complete (West Bengal).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    About 35,000 people (6,500 households in 20 of the fishing villages in Odisha) are now free of debt and have almost all risen above the subsistence level of net&#13;
          income. (Target - 250,000 people to be free of poverty and debt by 2016).&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. One-third of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s children are born with low birth weight; 43 percent of those under 5 are underweight; 48&#13;
percent are stunted; 20 percent wasted; 70 percent anemic; and 57 percent vitamin A deficient. Undernourished children: have higher rates of mortality; lower cognitive&#13;
and school performance; are more likely to drop out of school; and are less productive later in life, with an estimated 10 percent potential reduction in individual lifetime&#13;
earnings and a 2-3 percent loss in GDP. Much of undernourishment occurs during pregnancy and in the first two years of life, when, without appropriate interventions, the&#13;
damage to brain development, future economic productivity, and consequently human development, is largely irreversible. The Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s flagship program, the&#13;
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), is designed to facilitate the holistic development of children by providing supplementary nutrition, and health and child care&#13;
services to pregnant and lactating women and children less than 6 years of age. As implemented, however, it does not preferentially target children under 2 and pregnant-&#13;
nursing mothers, and has not focused enough on effective nutrition interventions such as promoting appropriate feeding and caring practices. That has limited its impact&#13;
on malnutrition. The Government of India restructured the ICDS in 2012 to strengthen its focus on 0-3 year olds and on behavior change for nutrition, and designed a multi-&#13;
sectoral program in high-burden districts to address the multi-causal nature of malnutrition. The World Bank-supported ISSNIP, was designed to help the government build&#13;
the necessary capacity and systems to implement this reformed approach, as well as test innovations and pilots to improve implementation.&#13;
The project was unable to demonstrate implementation progress, and in September 2015 was restructured to narrow the project scope to a few, evidence-based, interventions&#13;
that aim to achieve behavior change for improved nutrition amongst women and young children. The overarching goal of the project is to strengthen the demand and supply&#13;
side systems and interventions to improve behaviors for infant and young child feeding and caring amongst pregnant and lactating women. The development objective is&#13;
to support the Government of India and participating states to: (i) strengthen the ICDS policy framework, systems, and capacities, and facilitate community engagement, to&#13;
ensure greater focus on children under 3; and (ii) strengthen convergent actions for improved nutrition outcomes. The project has four components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  ICDS institutional and systems strengthening to develop and implement an ICT-enabled real time monitoring and service improvement system and capacity building&#13;
      of ICDS program staff and anganwadi workers.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  Community mobilization and behavior change communication to promote and strengthen processes for community engagement and action, empowerment of ben-&#13;
      eficiaries, and increased social accountability of the ICSD program through outreach interventions to priority households and community-based counselling and public&#13;
      education events.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  Convergent nutrition action to provide support at the central and state levels to develop and implement pilots and innovations to improve nutrition outcomes.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;  Project management, monitoring, and evaluation. Strengthening the capacity of the directorates of ICDS to comply with their project management and implementation&#13;
      responsibilities&#13;
A challenge fund was established to incentivize project states for faster pace of achievement of results, and a programmatic multi-donor trust fund was set up to provide&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the number of pregnant/lactating women, adolescent girls and/or children under age 5 reached by basic nutrition services.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase the number of children under 24 months benefiting from improved infant and young child feeding practices.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    60 percent of targeted anganwadi centers reporting key nutrition and service delivery indicators using ICT systems every month for last three months.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    80 percent of project districts having implemented the â&#128;&#156;incremental capacity buildingâ&#128;&#157; system.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Six project states having developed â&#128;&#156;convergent nutrition action plansâ&#128;&#157; in at least one district.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The region owing to its geographical and geo-climatic setting is a multi-hazard prone area that has experienced natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, landslides,&#13;
     avalanches, high-velocity winds, and snowstorms. Most parts of the valley fall in Seismic Zone V. The rest of the state falls in the Seismic Zone IV. Floods and flash floods&#13;
     are also frequent. Floods generally occur in the summer when heavy rains are followed by snowmelt. Flooding of the river Jhelum is the main cause of floods in the&#13;
     region.&#13;
     In September 2014, the northern region of India experienced torrential monsoon rains, causing major flooding and landslides. The continuous spell of rains from&#13;
     September 2-6, 2014, caused Jhelum and Chenab Rivers as well as many other streams/tributaries to flow above the danger mark. The Jhelum River also breached its&#13;
     banks, flooding many low-lying areas in Anantnag, Srinagar and adjoining districts. Due to the rivers overflowing, nearly 20 districts were impacted.&#13;
&#13;
     Following a request from the Government of India, a mission of the World Bank conducted a rapid multi-sectoral assessment report of the damages and needs. The&#13;
     Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment estimates the total damage and loss caused by floods at about INR211,975 million (equivalent $3.55 million); housing,&#13;
     livelihoods, and roads and bridges combined to account for more than 70 percent of the damages in terms of value. Public-service infrastructure and the equipment&#13;
     of hospitals and education centers were also severely damaged.&#13;
&#13;
     The primary focus of the project is to restore critical infrastructure using international best practice on resilient infrastructure. Given the regionâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to both&#13;
     floods and earthquakes, the infrastructure will be designed with upgraded resilient features, and will include contingency planning for future disaster events. The&#13;
     project has seven components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    reconstruction and strengthening of critical infrastructure;&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    reconstruction of roads and bridges;&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    restoration of urban flood management infrastructure&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    restoration and strengthening of livelihoods&#13;
     strengthening disaster risk management capacity ($25 million); (vi) contingent emergency response; and (vii) implementation support The investments are expected&#13;
     to support the recovery and increase disaster resilience in project areas, and increase the capacity of the project implementing entity to respond promptly and effectively&#13;
     to an eligible crisis or emergency.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    1 million people served by restored and improved public buildings including hospitals and education buildings.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    1.5 million people with access to restored and improved roads and bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    750,000 people benefiting from improved flood management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    40,000 people who received support to restoration of livelihoods.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Updated seismic code guidelines for urban infrastructure with inputs from the urban vulnerability assessment and design standards study.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Karnataka, a state in the south of India, has a population of 61 million with higher per capita income and better health indicators than all-India averages, although&#13;
there are significant socio-economic disparities within the state. As government health spending has substantially increased in recent years, basic investments and&#13;
operations of health services have largely been assured from domestic funds. Nevertheless, system-level challenges persist, the quality and responsiveness of health&#13;
services continue to require improvement, significant gaps remain in access to services, and the state is confronting new health challenges, notably the growing&#13;
burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD). In this context, the Karnataka Health System Development and Reform Project has focused on supporting policy change,&#13;
institutional development, new strategies and innovations, and filling gaps.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to improve health service delivery, public-private collaboration, and financing, particularly for underserved and vulnerable groups&#13;
in Karnataka. The project has three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Strengthening existing government health programs: Supports policy change, institutional capacity development at the state and district levels, and health&#13;
      service quality improvement.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Innovations in service delivery and health financing: Supports investments in health service delivery capacity (i.e. round-the-clock health centers to improve ma-&#13;
      ternal care); service-delivery contracts with non-governmental organizations (NGOs); environmental health and regulation; a pilot for the prevention and control&#13;
      of non-communicable disease; and a pilot road safety program (coordinated with an IDA-financed transport project). This component also supports institutional&#13;
      development of a government health insurance scheme financing hospital services for the poor.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Project management and monitoring and evaluation: Supports overall project oversight and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     An assessment of organizational development needs has been done and training implemented, district health administration and planning has been strength-&#13;
      ened, management and clinical guidelines have been developed, procurement reform has been implemented, and monitoring and evaluation have been&#13;
      strengthened. Over 26,000 health personnel received training, surpassing the end-project target.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     The project has financed construction and renovation of 329 health facilities, 13 drug warehouses, and 27 training centers, while 111 mobile health clinics and&#13;
      19 citizensâ&#128;&#153; help desks in hospitals are run by contracted NGOs. The institutional capacity of the government health insurance scheme has been strengthened. A&#13;
      needs assessment and technical design for the planned NCD and road safety activities have commenced.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     The proportion of births delivered in a health facility has risen from 65 percent in 2005-06 to 86 percent in 2009 (with an end-project target of 90 percent)&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Number of claims paid by the health insurance pilot program benefiting poor households exceeds 32,000 (compared to the end-project target of 45,000).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     47.33 percent of government Primary Health Centers now provide round-the-clock services, compared to a base line of zero in 2005 and an end-project target&#13;
      of 47 percent&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Karnataka, located in the southwest of India, is the eighth largest state in the country, with a population of about 61 million. With 34 percent of the people living in&#13;
     urban centers, Karnataka is the fifth most urbanized state in India. Although considered to be a middle-income state and growing at or above the all-India economic&#13;
     rate of growth, Karnataka has wide regional development disparities, posing risks for sustaining high growth and making it more inclusive. Improving infrastructure,&#13;
     including road transport, is a key component of the Government of Karnatakaâ&#128;&#153;s development strategy to sustain growth and bridge regional disparities. Within the&#13;
     stateâ&#128;&#153;s relatively extensive road network of 208,262 km, the Department of Public Works, Ports, and Inland Water Transport is responsible for managing 22,078 km of&#13;
     state highways and 50,037 km of major district roads. The department faces two notable challenges: a significant paucity of resources for improving the quality and&#13;
     standards of transport infrastructure, and worsening road safety (in 2009, the state accounted for 10 percent of road accidents and 7 percent of road fatalities in all of&#13;
     India). The Bank-supported Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project aims to support the government of Karnataka in two areas of highway development: (i)&#13;
     achieving more diversified sector financing, building upon Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience in extensive use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the development of national&#13;
     highways; and (ii) improving road safety design, management, and enforcement to reduce road fatalities and major injuries.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to accelerate the development of the Core Road Network by leveraging public-sector outlays with private-sector financing and&#13;
     improving the institutional effectiveness of the road-sector agencies to deliver effective and safe roads to users. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road improvement works support capital improvement and maintenance works of core road network through a combination of traditional contracts and PPP&#13;
          concessions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Highway financing modernization assists the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited in implementing the concept of co-financing with private finan-&#13;
          cial institutions through technical assistance and pilot transactions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety improvement helps the Government of Karnataka respond to the growing road safety problems in the state with comprehensive strategic and&#13;
          institutional measures, consistent with the main thrusts of the 2007 Sundar Committee report and the findings of the road safety management capacity review.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road-sector policy and institutional development support implementation of a new medium-term Institutional Development and Strengthening Action Plan for&#13;
          2010-2016.&#13;
&#13;
     EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The Government of Karnataka is expected to generate at least $500 million in new private-sector capital for Core Road Network improvement and management&#13;
          by 2016; as of June 2014, $144 million has been generated.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    160 km of a planned 269 km has been upgraded and widened (June 2014).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Share of Core Road Network in good condition increases from 50 to 65 percent by 2016; currently 57 percent of the CRN is in good condition.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Vehicle operating costs are targeted to decrease by 15 percent, and travel time cost on project corridors is targeted to decrease by 25 percent by 2016.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road accident-related fatalities on safe corridor pilots should decrease by 30 percent by 2016.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Approximately 60 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s population depends on rain-fed agriculture for their primary livelihood. Thirteen states, including Karnataka, account for about 75&#13;
percent of the total rain-fed area in India, and have low agricultural productivity and are susceptible to drought, deepening environmental stress, and degradation. The&#13;
Government of India is helping states address these issues through the National Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) supplemented by the National&#13;
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). Yet IWMP, which finances soil and water conservation activities in arid, rain-fed areas, has not achieved desired results.&#13;
The Karnataka Watershed Development Project-II (KWDP-II) is a new approach for watershed management in India. The design builds on the earlier Bank-supported&#13;
Karnataka Watershed Development Project-I (KWDP-I), which is seen as one of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s most successful watershed projects, winning five prestigious national&#13;
and three major international awards. KWDP-I generated a substantial number of positive lessons and best practices around integrated watershed management,&#13;
agricultural intensification, rural livelihoods, monitoring and evaluation, and building resilience to climate change. The Bank is providing mainly technical support to&#13;
help the IWMP achieve better results and improve convergence with NREGS.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to demonstrate more effective watershed management through greater integration of programs related to rain-fed agriculture,&#13;
innovative and science-based approaches, and strengthened institutions and capacities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved program integration in rain-fed areas will demonstrate the successful integration of programs in watershed development, using a science-based ap-&#13;
     proach in project areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Research, development and innovation will establish a coordinated research approach to provide practical knowledge and tools to support integrated watershed&#13;
     management.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening will strengthen the institutions and human resources of key stakeholders to improve effective delivery of services for integrated&#13;
     watershed management.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening horticulture in rain-fed areas will strengthen the knowledge base regarding horticulture potential in rain-fed areas, and demonstrate and build the&#13;
     capacity of institutions and communities to improve production and value addition of horticulture in project areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management and coordination will ensure effective and efficient project management.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
Under the project, new science-based approaches and tools will be adopted into wider IWMP watershed operations, such as improved hydrological inputs as part of&#13;
landscape scale watershed assessments, and decision-support models used for site selection. Up to 70 percent of micro-watersheds will have improved convergence&#13;
and integration with other programs such as NREGS. Agricultural and horticultural productivity in IWMP project areas for selected crops is expected to increase. As per&#13;
the projectâ&#128;&#153;s results framework, progress on a range of indicators will be available in year three of project implementation.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Kerala is considered a front runner in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s decentralization reforms. Local governments in Kerala are in a unique situationâ&#128;&#148;taking on more devolved responsibilities&#13;
     and with a greater degree of local autonomy. Kerala is undertaking a second generation of decentralization reforms, which focus, in a practical and incremental manner,&#13;
     on expanding local expenditure autonomy, strengthening local government institutional capacity, and enhancing the state governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to manage and&#13;
     oversee the intergovernmental fiscal system. The Kerala Local Government and Service Delivery Project contributes to the Government of Keralaâ&#128;&#153;s second generation&#13;
     decentralization reforms through support to enhance governance and improve service delivery. At the national level, the project supports the overall process of&#13;
     decentralization as mandated under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments of the Government of India. The project development objective is to enhance and&#13;
     strengthen the institutional capacity of the local government system in Kerala to deliver services and undertake basic administrative and governance functions more&#13;
     effectively and sustainably. The project supports 978 Gram Panchayats (GPs) and 60 municipalities across the state. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Performance grants: Provides GPs and municipalities with additional discretionary funds, based on a formula, to expand local investment in the creation, main-&#13;
          tenance, and operation of capital assets, as an incentive for strengthening institutional capacity.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building: Provides inputs to strengthen and supplement the existing systems and human resources of GPs and municipalities, to enhance their institu-&#13;
          tional performance.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Performance monitoring: Supports strengthening the system of performance monitoring GPs and municipalities across the state.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Support the project management nnit: within the Local Self Government (LSG) Department in overall coordination, implementation, and monitoring and evalu-&#13;
          ation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    99 percent of 1,038 LSGs qualified for performance grants based on fulfilling the two minimum mandatory conditions: clean external audits and passing the&#13;
          annual budget.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    77 percent of LSGs have qualified for enhanced performance grants for boosting service delivery. Through the project, the state government has completed the&#13;
          first annual performance evaluation process of LSGs, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving systems and processes of local public administration.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Support to Information Kerala Mission to roll out various e-governance systems in all LSGs enabled enhanced service delivery, transparency, and accountability.&#13;
          LSGs have migrated from maintenance of manual bookkeeping and accounting to computerized double entry accounting, as well as online planning and budget-&#13;
          ing systems.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Sub-projects include e-governance enhancements (e.g. enabling citizens to get birth, death, and marriage certificates on time), connective infrastructure (e.g.&#13;
          roads), social services (e.g. education, health and anganwadi centers), income generation (street lights, bus stands, bus parks, markets), water supply and sanita-&#13;
          tion, solid and liquid waste management, energy projects, and LSGsâ&#128;&#153; front office modernization and computerization.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    21 million people (77.6 percent female) have benefited from the project, against an end-of-project target of 29.5 million.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Provided training to LSGsâ&#128;&#153; elected representatives and functionaries, and contributed to modernization of the state governmentâ&#128;&#153;s focal institutes for local govern-&#13;
          ment capacity building, namely Kerala Institute of Local Administration and the State Institute for Rural Development.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Greater awareness and adherence to fiduciary and social safeguard policies.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Kerala has the highest human development outcomes in India, with 99 percent literacy, the highest life expectancy, and the lowest rates of infant mortality. Despite&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic slowdown as a result of the global downturn, Keralaâ&#128;&#153;s economy preformed much better than expected (gross state domestic product (GSDP)&#13;
$59.4 billion: FY2011-2012). Nonetheless, Kerala has not been spared from the global slowdown; low capital investment in economic infrastructure has been an&#13;
unfortunate consequence of fiscal constraints and high revenue expenditures. Keralaâ&#128;&#153;s draft Road Development Policy estimates that improving existing roads to match&#13;
the economic aspirations of the state will require an annual investment of $885 million over the next 10 years.&#13;
The main goal of the Kerala State Transport Project II (KSTP II), which follows the first KSTP that ended in 2010, is to support the state in upgrading the most critical&#13;
and strategically important state highways and building sustainable institutions. On a pilot basis, a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the Stateâ&#128;&#153;s Public Works&#13;
Department and a private concessionaireâ&#128;&#148;one of the first of its kind in Indiaâ&#128;&#148;will be established to deliver a specific road section. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s technical assistance is&#13;
aimed at helping the state attract much needed private-sector investment and innovation to the road sector. The project also seeks to support efforts by the government&#13;
to reverse the trend in road accidents and deaths. While the number of road crashes in Kerala declined by 17 percent between 2005 and 2011, the number of traffic&#13;
fatalities has increased by 27 percent during the same period, from 3,200 to 4,100. The project will pilot the concept of road safety demonstration corridors and&#13;
increase local participation through a â&#128;&#156;road safety challenge fundâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to improve conditions, traffic flow, and road safety, with a focus on vulnerable road users, on selected roads in Kerala. The Project&#13;
has three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road network upgrading and safety improvement includes upgrading (widening to full two-lane standard) 363 km of strategically important state highways to&#13;
     complete network connectivity in the state.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety management supports the strengthening of the road safety management systems in Kerala with the objective of arresting the increase of crash fatali-&#13;
     ties in the state, with a particular focus on vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening improves the sustainability of Keralaâ&#128;&#153;s state road network with respect to its functional adequacy, financial viability, and capacity of key&#13;
     state road sector institutions to deliver road infrastructure and services that are responsive to road user needs.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
The project will enhance connectivity between key socio-economic centers and reduce travel times between the main engines of economic activity in the state.&#13;
Improved roads under the project will impact the lives of countless people. It is expected that the project will reach 13.4 million direct beneficiaries, more than half&#13;
of whom are women. Travel time on the improved roads should decrease by 20 percent. Approximately 350 km of improved roads will have significantly improved&#13;
capacity and smoothness. The road safety emphasis of the projects should help reduce the number of fatalities by 20 percent on the safe road demonstration corridors.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Housing shortages in India, with a growing urban population, are the result of complex supply and demand factors. Inappropriate land-use policies and building&#13;
     norms artificially restrict the supply of housing. There is a lack of land serviced by utilities with appropriate zoning and formal property rights. Demand is constrained&#13;
     by lack of formal housing finance, especially for lower-income households (incomes below Rs 16,666 per month). More than 90 percent of the housing shortage&#13;
     is faced by these lower-income households, which have traditionally not been a commercial target for mainstream financial institutions. Only 31 percent of these&#13;
     households with housing loans obtained their mortgages from the two cheapest sources of credit (banks and government programs). Microfinance, if available, is&#13;
     restricted to small loan sizes with high interest rates. Lower-income households face high borrowing costs due to, among other things, the informality of their income&#13;
     (no documentation of income) and the informality of their dwelling (no clear title to the property that can be mortgaged).&#13;
&#13;
     The main objective of the Low-Income Housing Finance Project for India is to provide access to sustainable housing finance for low-income households to purchase,&#13;
     build, or upgrade their dwellings. The project aims to address market failures by giving the necessary capacity building and implementation support and incentives&#13;
     to the National Housing Bank (NHB)â&#128;&#148;the apex level financial institution for housing finance in Indiaâ&#128;&#148;intermediary institutions, and primary lending institutions to&#13;
     expand lending to lower-income groups. The project also provides finance for NHB to refinance low-income housing loans made by primary lenders.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the number of primary lenders active in the low-income segments.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the volume of lending to lower-income borrowers.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the number of borrowers in these segments.&#13;
     Financing under the project aims to create incentives for lenders to focus on lower-income households. The project also aims to deliver on its stated objective of&#13;
     reaching a higher proportion of lower-income households while maintaining portfolio quality standards. The project expects to: develop prudent lending standards to&#13;
     serve the more vulnerable, lower-income households; expand the coverage of credit bureaus to include informal-income borrowers; develop consumer information&#13;
     and disclosure norms for the projectâ&#128;&#153;s target groups; enhance the appraisal capacity of the lenders; and pilot new policies and products to overcome the challenges&#13;
     of dwelling informality.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Madhya Pradesh (MP), with a GSDP per capita of $898 (2012), is a low-income state, with a population of 73 million. Nearly 10 percent of all HE students in India&#13;
are enrolled in university/colleges in MP. These 1.6 million students attend 36 universities and 1,316 colleges in the state. In 2012-13, the gross enrollment ratio in&#13;
HE in the state was 19.5 percent, which was close to the national average of 21.1 percent. However, there is substantial inequity in access and participation in Higher&#13;
Education institutions between genders, rural and urban areas, and across social groups, in particular for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe youth. There are also&#13;
major concerns of quality, relevance, accountability, and governance of the HE system in the state. Universities and colleges have limited autonomy in academic,&#13;
financial, and administrative matters. There is shortage of human and financial resources; these constraints are further exacerbated by inefficient and ineffective&#13;
systems and practices.&#13;
The Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Quality Improvement Project (MPHEQIP) supports the implementation of the Government of Madhya Pradeshâ&#128;&#153;s vision for the&#13;
higher education sector as articulated in its Vision 2018 Document and the State Higher Education Plan 2014, which focuses on: (i) excellence and employability of&#13;
higher education graduates through better quality of education services offered, improved teaching-learning resources, and research; (ii) expanding equity and access;&#13;
and (iii) strengthened sector and institutional governance and financing, and management.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective of MPHEQIP is to improve student outcomes especially of disadvantaged groups in selected higher education institutions (HEIs) and to&#13;
increase the effectiveness of the higher education system in Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
&#13;
MPHEQIP will use an investment project financing lending instrument utilizing a results based financing modality.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Number of project beneficiaries in all institutions of Higher Education.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    On time graduation rates of undergraduate students (disaggregated by relevant socio-economic categories) at supported institutions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Government HEIs accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Government HEIs publishing an annual report in prescribed format.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Supported HEIs satisfaction scores of beneficiaries: percentage at least satisfied (disaggregated by relevant categories).&#13;
It is expected that approximately 3.6 million students, 10,800 academic staff, and 1,400 administrators and officers in nearly 200 government colleges and university&#13;
departments and key state entities will benefit directly from project interventions. Indirect beneficiaries will include employers (both within and outside the state) who&#13;
will have a more skilled HE graduatesâ&#128;&#153; pool to choose from, households that can expect higher income streams in the future due to the earnings of more productive&#13;
graduates, and investors who can benefit from the greater presence of higher quality human capital and research output in the state.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Farmers in the state of Maharashtra have severely limited choices in accessing markets. They continue to rely on regulated wholesale marketsâ&#128;&#148;known as mandi,&#13;
     or Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) marketsâ&#128;&#148;which are mandatory for the wholesale trading of many agricultural products. The relatively small&#13;
     number of licensed traders and commission agents in these markets has not only limited farmersâ&#128;&#153; choices, but also resulted in strong political economy interests to&#13;
     preserve this system, and under-investment in physical infrastructure. The challenge for Maharashtra is to create an environment that enables the farming community&#13;
     to acquire the technical capacity necessary to access market opportunities that result in higher returns and better farm incomes. The Government of Maharashtraâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     long-term development plan for improving agriculture productivity and competitiveness includes working through the Bank-supported Maharashtra Agricultural&#13;
     Competitiveness Project (MACP) to implement a three-pronged approach that: (i) promotes the development of alternative marketing options; (ii) supports the top&#13;
     tier of regulated wholesale markets in the state to reform, invest, and provide better services; and (iii) gradually undertakes regulatory reforms. Regulatory change,&#13;
     investments in physical infrastructure, strengthened capacity, and improved governance, as well as the participation of all stakeholders (farmers, traders, commission&#13;
     agents, processors, and consumers) is expected to improve competitiveness. Over time, the rest of the agriculture marketing system in Maharashtra is expected to&#13;
     become more efficient.&#13;
&#13;
     The development objective of the MACP is to increase the productivity, profitability, and market access of the farming community in Maharashtra. Project activities are&#13;
     grouped into three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Intensification and diversification of market-led production: Supports agriculture technology transfer, facilitates networking among farmers and agribusinesses&#13;
          on emerging marketing opportunities, provides market intelligence using information and communications technology-based applications and other means,&#13;
          and strengthens livestock support services in the state.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improving farmer access to markets: Promotes alternative market opportunities by establishing farmer groups and a warehouse receipts system, upgrading local&#13;
          rural markets, piloting e-trading platforms, and modernizing existing wholesale markets and livestock yards.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project management, learning, and adjusting: Undertakes project coordination and management, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTSAND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     Progress under agriculture marketing reformsâ&#128;&#148;such as allowing the establishment of private agriculture wholesale markets, contract farming, direct purchase from&#13;
     producers by agribusinesses, and removal of minimum distance criteriaâ&#128;&#148;are leading to the emergence of alternative market arrangements outside the regulated&#13;
     markets.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Steady increase in the emergence of the alternative marking arrangement outside the traditional marketing system. Alternative markets turnover (for FY 2012-&#13;
          2013) accounts for 8 percent of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s recorded turnover.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Model by-laws and uniform accounting standards rolled out across the state; innovative e-trading pilots to improve the transparency of business processes&#13;
          underway.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    3,300 commodity groups mobilized; project collaborating with large number of private sector input suppliers and output buyers.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Agribusiness Promotion Facility (ABPF) set up under the project has been rolled out in Phase 1 district. Through a structured approach and working with close to&#13;
          28 financial institutions, ABPF facilitates access of entrepreneurs to commercial loans and grants, under various government of India and government of Maha-&#13;
          rashtra schemes. ABPF has mobilized Rs 81.50 million of agribusiness investments in the state.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Warehouse receipts development: With a focused extension and tie-up with commercial banks, there has seen a steady increase in farmers opting for scientific&#13;
          storage and accessing working capital finance from commercial banks.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the last decade, but its economy now shows signs of slowing down. Between 2004 and 2011, a period that&#13;
includes the global financial crisis, Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth averaged 8.3 percent per year. Expanding social programs lowered the poverty rate by 1.5 percentage points per&#13;
year during 2004-09, double the rate of the preceding decade. Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth rate, however, slipped to a decade low of 5 percent in 2012-13 due to a combination of&#13;
domestic and external factors, including high inflation, high fiscal deficit and weak external demand for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports. This slowdown carries high social costs for&#13;
millions of Indians, and threatens the gains made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Under its current 10-year RWSS program, the Government of Maharashtra&#13;
seeks to significantly expand the frontiers in the sector with a focus on increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate&#13;
pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that 100 percent of the rural population has access to safe water and basic sanitation. However, delivering&#13;
this vision requires building capacities of institutions through appropriate implementation and management models. Maharashtra is also a rapidly urbanizing state&#13;
with many large villages (each with a population of more than 10,000 people) and a growing number of peri-urban areas that are demanding higher levels of service.&#13;
Finally, the state also faces challenges in addressing the needs of water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas, managing drinking water quality, and ensuring&#13;
drinking water security in the face of increasing droughts and climate change impacts on rainfall patterns and the yield of existing sources.&#13;
&#13;
The program development objective is to improve the performance of Maharashtraâ&#128;&#153;s sector institutions in planning, implementation and monitoring of its Rural Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation program and to improve access to quality and sustainable services in peri-urban villages, and in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank supports a portion of the broader Government of Maharashtra program over a six-year period (2014-20), focusing on two primary set of activities which&#13;
address the underlying challenges of the sector in Maharashtra: (i) institutional capacity building for planning, implementation, and monitoring of the RWSS sector&#13;
across Maharashtra; and (ii) in select districts, implementation of: (a) water supply and sullage management service improvement in peri-urban villages; and (b) water&#13;
supply.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
This program for results operation is in the early stages of implementation. By the 2020 closing date, the following results are expected to be achieved:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthened sector planning and monitoring.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved capacity for program implementation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved access to quality and sustainable water and sanitation services in peri-urban villages.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved access to safe drinking water in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.&#13;

&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:&#13;
     The high cost of limited regional integration and trade in the northeastern part of South Asia is clearly illustrated by the case of Mizoram state in India. Despite its&#13;
     potentially advantageous geographic location between Myanmar and Bangladesh, Mizoram in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Northeastern region is one of the poorest in the country, ranking&#13;
     26th out of 28 states in terms of per capita income. Mizoramâ&#128;&#153;s lagging economic development is in large part due to its landlocked location, poor infrastructure and&#13;
     limited linkages with the markets and ports of neighboring countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Myanmar.&#13;
&#13;
     Mizoramâ&#128;&#153;s road network is poor in quality and under-developed, and has among the lowest density in all of India. Key issues and challenges in the road sector include:&#13;
     inadequate sector funding, inadequate maintenance, weak planning for investments, not the most up-to-date road engineering practices and business procedures,&#13;
     limited capacity of road agency staff, low capacity of the local construction industry, and poor road safety management.&#13;
     The development objective for Mizoram Roads II Regional Connectivity Project is to increase transport connectivity along regional trade corridors in Mizoram. With&#13;
     road transport being the only mode of transport within the state, improvements to the network should enhance the environment for development and growth by&#13;
     reducing freight and passenger transport costs while providing quicker and safer access to all parts of the state and to neighboring states and countries. The project&#13;
     has two components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improvement of priority cross-border roads and trade-related infrastructure: Widening and strengthening 91 km of road and preparation studies for approxi-&#13;
          mately 330 km of road, along with construction or improvement of trade-related infrastructure along project roads.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road sector modernization and performance enhancement through institutional strengthening: Supports gradual transformation of the Public Works Depart-&#13;
          ment into a modern road agency through implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan that will carry forward and deepen various institutional develop-&#13;
          ment initiatives introduced under the first Mizoram State Roads Project.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    40 percent increase in traffic along project corridors.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    30 percent reduction in travel time on project corridors.&#13;
     Road sections under this project include: (i) a 22-km section of Lunglei â&#128;&#147; Tlabung â&#128;&#147; Kawrpuichhuah Road on the border with Bangladesh; (ii) the 27.5-km Champhai-&#13;
     Zokhawthar Road on the border with Myanmar; and (iii) the 41.7-km Chhumkhum-Chawngte North-South alignment connecting to the border roads with Bangladesh&#13;
     to the west and Myanmar to the south.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
In India, MSMEs account for more than 80 percent of total industrial enterprises, produce over 8,000 value-added products, and employ an estimated 60 million&#13;
people. MSMEs contribute around 45 percent to manufacturing output and about 40 percent to exports, both directly and indirectly. In addition, over 50 percent of&#13;
MSMEs are rural enterprises and widely distributed across low-income states, making them an important sector for promoting economic growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
With eight million people entering the labor force every year, MSMEs have the potential to be an important source of wage employment and entrepreneurship in India,&#13;
foster innovations as well as be the cradle for the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Make in Indiaâ&#128;&#157; vision formulated recently. For these ideas to take shape, addressing the key constraints&#13;
that inhibit MSMEs from accessing finance is of utmost importance.&#13;
&#13;
However, lack of adequate finance is one of the biggest challenges facing the MSME sector. Financial institutions have limited their exposure to the sector due to a&#13;
higher risk perception, information asymmetry, high transaction costs and the lack of collateral. The MSME census of 2006-07 estimated that about 87 percent of&#13;
MSMEs did not have any access to finance and were self-financed. Credit towards micro and small enterprises represents only around 13-15 percent of formal financial&#13;
institutions portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
This project will work with the government in developing innovative products that address the current constraints of MSMEs, respond to the changing needs of the&#13;
Indian economy and also catalyze private-sector financing. The project will support MSMEs through direct financing by the Small Industries Development Bank of India&#13;
(SIDBI), an apex financial institution for promotion, financing and development of MSMEs in India, as also through participating financial institutions across three&#13;
components. These include support to startup debt financing and risk capital as well as support to service and manufacturing sector financing models.&#13;
The project first component will support SIDBI in developing, innovating, and scaling up its startup debt-financing program. It will also support entry of potential&#13;
participating financing institutions in the development of this missing financial market. The second component supports service-sector firmsâ&#128;&#153; financing. This sector&#13;
continues to face challenges in accessing formal finance due to lack of physical assets to provide as collateral, despite the fact that the structure of the Indian economy&#13;
is markedly shifting towards services (65 percent of Indian GDP). The third component supports manufacturing MSMEs through innovative financial products including&#13;
loan extension services and cluster financingâ&#128;&#148;including women-led clusters. Particular focus will be to expand manufacturing activity in financially underserved areas,&#13;
including low-income states especially through refinancing.&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Outstanding MSME loan portfolios in risk capital financing including startups, and in the manufacturing abnd service sectors.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Outstanding MSME loan portfolio in the service sector&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Turnover of startups supported through the project&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Total number of MSMEs beneficiaries under the credit line&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Innovation and development of new financing products (including new approaches to startup loans, franchising finance).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Greater number of entrants as participating financing institutions under the credit line.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Loan extension services and energy efficiency audits to facilitate adoption of environmentally sound production.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved internal processing time, efficiency and strengthen credit appraisal methods for loans along these segments within SIDBI.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved collaboration for information sharing with external partners.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the number of women-owned/managed MSME beneficiaries under the credit line.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the number of MSMEs in low-income states benefitting from the line of credit&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Like other fast-growing urban centers in India, the Mumbai region faces enormous challenges, including an acute inadequacy of transport infrastructure. The suburban&#13;
     rail system is the lifeline of Mumbai, carrying about 7.4 million passengers daily and 2.7 billion annually. In the early 2000s, the Bank supported the Government&#13;
     of Maharashtra and Indian Railwaysâ&#128;&#153; efforts to ease transport constraints in the megalopolis through the first Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP). TranSforM,&#13;
     a comprehensive transport study for the Mumbai region, carried out under the MUTP, recommended further investment in the suburban rail system as a priority, in&#13;
     recognition of suburban railâ&#128;&#153;s dominant role in the regionâ&#128;&#153;s transport network. MUTP-2A is the follow-up investment in the rail sector, aimed at helping the government&#13;
     respond to continued growing demand for suburban rail transport in the Mumbai metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve the passenger-carrying capacity, passenger-comfort level, operational efficiency, and the institutional capacity of&#13;
     entities involved in the suburban rail system of Mumbai metropolitan area. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     EMU rolling stock fleet increase: 864 additional EMU (electric multiple unit) cars will be procured, increasing the fleet to 3,124.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Conversion of power supply from direct current to alternating current: Includes improvements to signals and telecommunications in three sections of the Mum-&#13;
           bai railway network.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     EMU maintenance facilities and stabling lines: New stabling lines will be built to accommodate the fleet increase.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Capacity strengthening and technical assistance: Strategic and tactical studies will be carried out, as well as capacity building and training.&#13;
     The over-stretched Mumbai suburban rail system also suffers from a poor safety record. A demonstration component has been added by restructuring the project to&#13;
     address safety-related issues and increase safety awareness.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     The project will increase the number of train services in peak hour (presently varying from 14.4 to 17 trains per hour) to 18 trains per hour on all lines.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Trains currently comprise nine or 12 cars each, and these will be converted to 12 cars each, resulting in increased carrying capacity.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Improved system efficiency will result in reduced journey time, varying from about 2.5 percent to 8 percent on different lines.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     The new trains being procured are more energy efficient, with a regenerative braking system, resulting in reduction of energy consumption by about 30 percent&#13;
           from conventional trains.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Technical assistance studies under the project are helping the implementing agency to build capacity and plan a more efficient suburban rail system.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India launched the first National AIDS Control Program (NACP I) in 1992, focusing on blood safety, prevention among high-risk groups, raising awareness among the general&#13;
population, and improving surveillance. In the second phase (NACP II, 1999-2006), India continued to expand the program at the state level, with greater emphasis on targeted&#13;
interventions and involving NGOs. In the third phase (NACP III, 2007-2012), India has scaled up targeted HIV prevention interventions for most at risk population groups and&#13;
further expanded the surveillance system. The World Bank supported all three phases of the NACP.&#13;
The goals of the fourth phase of the NACP are to accelerate reversal of the HIV epidemic and integrate responses. The National AIDS Control Support Project will support the&#13;
fourth phase of NACP (2012â&#128;&#147;2017), with a focus on HIV prevention and targeted interventions. The project will contribute to three components of the NACP IV: (i) prevention;&#13;
(ii) behavior change; and (iii) institutional strengthening. Two other components of NACP IVâ&#128;&#148;provision of care, treatment and support to people living with HIV and AIDS; and&#13;
strategic information systems, including disease surveillanceâ&#128;&#148;will be supported by the national budget, with technical and financial support from other donors.&#13;
The project development objective is to increase safe behavior among high-risk groups in order to contribute to the national goal of reversing the HIV epidemic by 2017. The&#13;
project has three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Scaling up targeted prevention interventions will support scaling up targeted interventions, with the aim of reaching hard-to-reach population groups that do not yet access&#13;
     and use the prevention services of the program, and saturating coverage of such population groups. This component will also support the state training resource center in&#13;
     capacity building for preventive interventions at the state level, and will focus on the bridge population, i.e. migrants and truckers.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Behavior change communications will include: (i) communication programs and campaigns for risk reduction and safe behavior, advocacy, social mobilization, and behav-&#13;
     ior change communication (BCC) to integrate people living with HIV and AIDS, and hard-to-reach groups, into society, and encourage changes in social attitudes to reduce&#13;
     the stigma and discrimination that they face, particularly at health facilities; as well as increase demand for and effective use of testing and counseling services; (ii) financ-&#13;
     ing a research and evaluation agency to assess the cost-effectiveness and program impact of BCC activities; and (iii) establishing and evaluating a helpline at the national&#13;
     and state level to further increase access to information and services.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening will: support innovations to enhance performance management, including fiduciary management; strengthen procurement and supply chain&#13;
     management; strengthen technical support units over a three-to-four year period to ensure quality of targeted interventions; support the services of an agent to procure&#13;
     opioid substitution therapy; disseminate best practices; and finance the necessary audits.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:&#13;
The project aims to achieve the following key results:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase safe behavior among high-risk groups. Indicated by 85 percent of female sex workers and 65 percent of men having sex with men reporting using a condom.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Maintain/increase access to targeted interventions to prevent HIV among populations at highest risk. Indicated by targeted interventions reaching 90 percent of female sex&#13;
     workers and 80 percent of high-risk men having sex with men in 2017.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Scale up prevention interventions for bridge population groups. Indicated by 90 percent of planned prevention interventions for migrants and truckers implemented by&#13;
     2017.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthen the institutional capacity and program management of the national program. Indicated by 90 percent of states submitting completed audit reports to the&#13;
     Department of AIDS Control within agreed time limits, and 80 percent of NGOs contracted as per the States AIDS Control societies, by 2017.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase demand for HIV services through behavior change communications. Indicated by 80 percent of high-burden districts implementing BCC strategy and plan, with&#13;
     focus on demand generation and stigma reduction, by 2017.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. Approximately 5,700 km of the total 7,500 km of coastline is&#13;
     exposed to severe cyclones, and an estimated 40 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of the coast. Between 1980 and 2000, on average 370 million&#13;
     people were exposed to cyclones. Up to half of all tropical cyclones affecting South Asia hit the Indian coastline, which is particularly susceptible to storm surges due&#13;
     to a shallow coastal shelf and particular tidal characteristics. The economic impact is also considerable; studies indicate natural disaster losses of as much as 2 percent&#13;
     of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP and as much as 12 percent of federal government revenues. Low-lying terrain, high population density, and limited community awareness make the&#13;
     population in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s coastal states and union territories extremely vulnerable. As climate change and weather variability become more pronounced, hazard events are&#13;
     likely to increase. The National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project supports the Government of India in its efforts to mitigate cyclone-related risk and integrate disaster&#13;
     mitigation into the long-term national development process.&#13;
&#13;
     The development objectives of the project are to reduce vulnerability of coastal communities living in the vulnerable coastal states and Union Territories of India to&#13;
     cyclone and other hydro-meteorological hazards. The project is the first phase of a proposed three-phased adaptable program loan. The first phase of the project covers&#13;
     the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Early warning system and capacity building for coastal communities aims to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities by addressing the existing gaps in&#13;
           disseminating warnings to communities, and in piloting and using new technology.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure aims to improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and protection against cyclones and other hydro-meteorological&#13;
           hazards such as wind storms, flooding, and storm surge in high risk areas.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Technical assistance for national and state level capacity building and knowledge creation aims to help understand risk and vulnerabilities better, and prepare key&#13;
           institutions to address them effectively, across India. Activities include studies, assessments, training and capacity building activities related to risk and damage&#13;
           assessments, development of training modules and action plans and implementing them through identified partner agencies.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Project management and implementation support provides support for project management by financing incremental operating costs for the project manage-&#13;
           ment unit and implementation units, nodal units in line departments and the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), office equipment, training and&#13;
           exposure visits, and consulting services for specialist activities.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVE AND EXPECTED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     About 84 cyclone shelters, 550 evacuation roads, and 11 bridges have been completed. By 2015, 297 shelters, 1,050 km of roads, and 160 km of embankment&#13;
           strengthening work will have been completed.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     45 percent of the coastal population now have access to cyclone shelters, up from 30 percent at the start of the project and against a 60 percent end-of-project&#13;
           target.&#13;

 *US$ millions; as of August 31, 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
About 5,700 kilometers of the Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s coastline is exposed to severe cyclones and approximately 40 percent of total population lives within 100 km of the coastline.&#13;
It is estimated that on an average, annually, 370 million people are exposed to cyclones in India. As climate change and variability become more pronounced, hazard&#13;
events are set to grow.&#13;
&#13;
The National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) aims at assisting the Government of India and the target coastal states to increase their resilience to cyclones,&#13;
storm surge, and floods in coastal areas, and to increase their capacity for disaster risk mitigation at the national level. The project is part of a series of disaster risk&#13;
mitigation initiativesâ&#128;&#148;including NCRMP I and Additional Financing, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project, and the Odisha Disaster&#13;
Reconstruction Projectâ&#128;&#148;that will provide support in reducing coastal vulnerability for Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s entire mainland coast.&#13;
NCRMP is the first Bank-funded project in India exclusively focusing on ex-ante disaster risk mitigation. It is being implemented by the NDMA with support from the&#13;
Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, focusing on cyclone prone coastal states and union territories. The project is structured in phases, based on the risk&#13;
levels of the states and their implementation readiness.&#13;
&#13;
Phase I, under implementation since 2010, includes the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The project amount is $455 million ($359 million IDA credit and $96&#13;
million counterpart funds).&#13;
&#13;
Phase II includes the states of Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and West Bengal. The project has four principal components: (i) early warning&#13;
dissemination systems (EWDS); (ii) cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure; (iii) technical assistance for multi-hazard risk management; and (iv) project management&#13;
and implementation support. The third component will be implemented by NDMA with support from the states while the first two components will be implemented&#13;
by the six participating states. The investments are expected to reduce the vulnerability to cyclone and other hydro-meteorological hazards of coastal communities in&#13;
the project states, and increase the capacity of the state entities to effectively plan for and respond to disasters.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    75 percent of the targeted coastal population covered by the EWDS.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    500,000 vulnerable people with access to cyclone shelters.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Milk is the single largest agricultural commodity in the country in terms of value of output. Almost half of rural households depend on dairy for their livelihood.&#13;
     About 80 percent of farmers are small and marginal, typically owning one to three milk-producing animals. But average milk yield is low compared to international&#13;
     standards, and the growth rate of domestic milk production has slowed in recent years while domestic demand continues to grow as incomes increase and food&#13;
     preferences shift. The gap between supply and demand has translated into higher milk prices, which is of concern in a country with a large vegetarian population for&#13;
     whom milk and milk products are an important part of food and nutritional security.&#13;
&#13;
     This project supports the National Dairy Plan (NDP) prepared by Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Dairy Development Board. The NDP is a multi-state initiative to improve milk animal&#13;
     productivity, strengthen and expand infrastructure for milk procurement at the village level, and enhance milk processing capacity and marketing over a 15-year&#13;
     horizon. With this project, the Bank is re-engaging in dairy development at the national level in India by supporting the first phase of the NDP through investments&#13;
     designed to enhance animal productivity and improve farmer access to organized milk marketing channels. Improving productivity in the Indian dairy sector can&#13;
     potentially contribute to improved food security and stability of nationalâ&#128;&#148;and globalâ&#128;&#148;milk prices, as well as to improved incomes of millions of smallholder milk&#13;
     producers.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to increase the productivity of milk-producing animals and improve market access of milk producers in project areas. The project&#13;
     finances three main components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Productivity enhancement aims to increase bovine productivity through support for improved animal breeding and nutrition services.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Milk collection and bulking aims to increase market access of milk producers by investing in village-level milk collection and bulking facilities.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Project management and learning supports management, coordination, monitoring, learning, and evaluation efforts related to the project.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Milk production per animal reached 5.13 liters/day, equal to a 2 percent increase relative to the baseline (target is 10 percent).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     No increase relative to the baseline of the proportion of â&#128;&#156;in-milkâ&#128;&#157; female animals to adult female animals (63 percent).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     Share of milk sold to the organized milk-processing sector is expected to remain at 65 percent through the lifetime of the project as some of the increased produc-&#13;
           tion will go household consumption.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;     The project targets: production of 2,500 genetically improved bulls; production of an additional 55 million doses of high quality semen; coverage of 2.7 million&#13;
           animals under a ration-balancing program; and organization of an additional 1.2 million dairy farmers into milk producer organizations.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Ganga River, despite being highly revered and the primary water resource for the heartland of India, is seriously polluted and under extreme environmental stress.&#13;
The river suffers from high levels of organic and bacterial pollution, resulting in a wide range of negative impacts, including on human health, agriculture, urban&#13;
services, and the environment. The pollution in the Ganga is primarily a result of inadequate infrastructure, the weak capacity of local water and wastewater utilities in&#13;
the basin, and the poor state of environmental monitoring and regulation. In 2009, the Government of India developed a new vision for clean-up and conservation of&#13;
the Ganga, leading to the establishment of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the mandate to develop and implement a multi-sector program.&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s National Ganga River Basin Project provides upstream support to the NGRBA for institutional development, program design, and early investments.&#13;
This is a flagship project of the World Bank and the Government of India, and has high priority in India due to the scale of the challenge, and the religious, historical,&#13;
and cultural importance of the Ganga River in India.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objectives are to support the NGRBA in: (i) building the capacity of its nascent operational-level institutions so they can manage the long-&#13;
term Ganga clean-up and conservation program; and (ii) implementing a diverse set of demonstrative investments for reducing point-source pollution loads in a&#13;
sustainable manner at priority locations on the Ganga. Project components cover:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional development: Including operationalization of the new NGRBA, communications campaigns for river cleaning, and technical assistance for city service&#13;
     providers and environmental regulators.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Infrastructure investments in four sectors: Wastewater collection and treatment; industrial pollution control; solid waste management; and riverfront develop-&#13;
     ment, with investments to be selected according to a framework approach.&#13;
The project supports activities in the center and in the five states through which the mainstream of the river runs: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and&#13;
West Bengal. Three of these are low-income and one is special category. The project is currently being restructured.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
Progress towards achieving the projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is measured by three outcome indicators:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Average rating of NGRBA-related institutions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Volume of untreated wastewater prevented from entering the Ganga due to project interventions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improvements in river water quality at targeted locations with significant investments.&#13;
A clean river would mean the conservation of a cultural icon in India and abroad and the economic lifeline of hundreds of millions of people, and a huge savings in&#13;
health costs by reducing the burden of disease associated with inadequate sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:&#13;
At the center: the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and the Central Pollution Control Board. In the states: new&#13;
State Program Management Groups (SPMGs) in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Below the SPMGs are multiple-executing agencies,&#13;
mostly large parastatals such as the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam in Uttar Pradesh, and the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation in Bihar.&#13;
&#13;
KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:&#13;
AusAID, DFID and Norway have supported the project through trust funds. AusAID has supported an important industrial pollution control project in Kanpur and plans&#13;
to support a proposed study tour to Australia.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The total road network in India is about 3.3 million km, of which about 2 percent are national highways and expressways carrying about 40 percent of total road&#13;
     traffic. Recognizing that the poor condition of national highways could impede high economic growth, in 2000 the Government of India launched the National&#13;
     Highway Development Project (NHDP), the largest highway project ever undertaken in the country. The responsibility for implementation was entrusted to the National&#13;
     Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The prime objective of the NHDP was to undertake widening of strategic national highways corridors. Prior to implementation&#13;
     of NHDP, the road sector faced persistent underfunding and grappled with poor institutional capacity to manage its network and programs. The existing network was&#13;
     neglected and the sector experienced a trend of â&#128;&#156;build-neglect-re-buildâ&#128;&#157;. With the launch of NHDP, the road sector could attract considerable private financing in&#13;
     addition to public funding through levying additional taxes on fuel. However, in recent times there have been difficulties in attracting private financing and new areas&#13;
     of concerns have emerged: weaknesses in project preparation; delays in land acquisition; large variations during construction; ineffective contract administration&#13;
     resulting in high numbers of contractual disputes; human resource constraints; and lack of safety awareness. The government is keen to address these challenges by&#13;
     improving NHAIâ&#128;&#153;s program management and operational efficiency.&#13;
     The project development objective is to assist NHAI in adopting appropriate practices to enhance its program management and operational efficiency. The project&#13;
     focuses on institutional strengthening and capacity building of NHAI through technical assistance in project preparation and management, research, training and&#13;
     capacity building, asset management and resource planning, PPPs, socioeconomic and environment impact evaluation, safety, HIV/AIDS prevention, and governance&#13;
     by adopting appropriate approaches and practices&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation of enterprise resource planning to computerize NHAI portfolio.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening design review process.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    System of third party quality audit established in NHAI.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation of asset management system.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Corporate governance assessment of NHAI.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    NHAI is in the process of engaging a road safety advisor.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Government of India is keen to sustain its achievements in economic growth, which has been at 8 percent per annum in recent years. Improving the level and&#13;
quality of infrastructure services will be critical for this goal. National highways (82,755 km) account for only 1.9 percent of the total road length in the country, but&#13;
carry over 40 percent of the total road traffic. While the government invested significantly in the core national highways under the NHDP, the remaining 43 percent&#13;
of the national highway network have not received adequate funding until recently. Considerable stretches of the non-NHDP network require strengthening and&#13;
upgrading, and suffer from major connectivity gaps. In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of the non-NHDP network. It holds the&#13;
key to ease poverty and share prosperity, and for achieving the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s objective of equitable and inclusive growth, as it often serves as the primary or sole link&#13;
with remote, economically lagging, or otherwise challenged regions. The government has identified a portion of non-NHDP roads for priority development through&#13;
external financing and budgetary allocations.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to improve national highway network connectivity to less-developed areas and low-income states, and enhance the institutional&#13;
capacity of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to better manage the highway network. The project consists of three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road improvement and maintenance component will upgrade and maintain national highways in three low-income states (Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan) and&#13;
     less-developed regions in two middle-income states (Karnataka and West Bengal).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional development component will enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage its highway network through supporting specific inter-&#13;
     ventions in the areas of: process improvements; network monitoring and management; financing; governance and accountability; and training.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety component will aim to improve road safety by: updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; improving road accident data collec-&#13;
     tion and analysis at the central level and in project states; strengthening road safety capacity at the central level; and promoting social marketing and awareness&#13;
     campaigns along project roads.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
Under the project, about 1,120 km of existing single/intermediate lane roads will be upgraded to two-lane standard, and maintained for five years after construction.&#13;
More specific expected results include:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase in the length of non-NHDP national highways in good and fair condition from 65 percent to 68.25 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    On project roads, percent reduction in average travel time and average vehicle operating cost; no increase in fatalities in road crashes.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved accident data management system and asset management system developed and implemented in at least three states.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Despite high GDP growth rate over the past decade, over 250 million rural people in India (45 million households) remain locked in poverty, living on less than $1 per&#13;
     day. One of the key challenges facing India today is how to successfully translate high economic growth into inclusive growth that leads to significant and accelerated&#13;
     rural poverty reduction. Rural livelihoods programs are designed to help tackle this immense development challenge.&#13;
     The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s engagement on rural livelihood programs dates back to a series of projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan started in&#13;
     2000. Since then, the Bank has invested more than a $1 billion in 11 livelihood projects at the state level. Thirty million rural poor have been mobilized to form their&#13;
     own institutions, enabling them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. The rural poor have been empowered socially and&#13;
     economically, enabling them to build linkages with state and market institutions. They have higher savings, more access to credit, livelihoods and public services, and&#13;
     households and communities benefit from increased public and private investment. The most vulnerable groups (women, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes)&#13;
     have been socially empowered, enabling them to build social and financial capital and increase access to growth opportunities. One of the main lessons learned from&#13;
     this decade-long engagement is that significant investment in building the institutional platforms of rural poor households is a critical foundation for sustainable&#13;
     poverty reduction. The National Rural Livelihoods Project supports the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to scale up these state-level interventions to the national level&#13;
     through support to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)â&#128;&#148;Aajeevika. Bank financing supports the program in 13 high poverty (also mostly low-income) states.&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to establish efficient and effective institutional platforms for the rural poor that enable them to increase household income&#13;
     through sustainable livelihood enhancements and improved access to financial and selected public services. Project components cover:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional and human capacity development: Aims to transform the role of the Ministry of Rural Development into that of providing high-quality technical&#13;
          assistance in the field of rural livelihoods promotion.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    State livelihood support: Aims to support state governments in establishing necessary institutional structures and mechanisms to implement NRLM activities&#13;
          from the state- to the block-level, including support to forming institutions for the rural poor.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Innovation and partnership support: Aims to create an institutional mechanism to identify, nurture, and support innovative ideas from across the country to ad-&#13;
          dress the livelihood needs of the rural poor.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project implementation support: Aims to strengthen the national mission management unit for effective project management at the national level to develop key&#13;
          systems and processes to coordinate and manage the project and the NRLM&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    All 13 participating states have set up the institutional architecture of the state missions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The program is intensively working with nearly 1.9 million households and 166,000 Self Help Groups (SHGs). These SHGs have saved $19 million so far and&#13;
          nearly $88 million worth of credit has been leveraged cumulatively from the commercial banks.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    It is expected that about 6 million identified rural poor households will be mobilized into community institutions, $100 million in cumulative savings would be&#13;
          made by rural poor households through thrift, $500 million in bank credit would be leveraged by rural poor households from the formal financial sector, one&#13;
          million rural poor households would have improved farm productivity, livestock productivity, and market access, and 500,000 new jobs would be created for the&#13;
          poor.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:&#13;
     The project recognizes partnerships as key implementation arrangements and encourages the states to directly access technical and knowledge support from reputed&#13;
     resource organizations, especially in the following areas:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Partnerships with home-grown models like International Fund for Agriculture Development/DFID/East Asia and Pacific, sharing the same ethos. Some of the ready&#13;
          candidates include MAVIM, OTELP, JTELP, WDC, and NGOs with track records.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Knowledge partners for programmatic verticals like BIRD (Financial Services), PRADAN (Agriculture and Ecological Services), BAIF (Livestock), Landesa (Land Ac-&#13;
          cess), and FAO (Agriculture and Livestock).&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The project would enhance the impacts of the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) operations in targeted watersheds, chiefly&#13;
through intensive technical assistance. Support would: (i) introduce landscape-level assessment and planning as a window for better program convergence; (ii)&#13;
strengthen participatory, evidence-based micro-watershed planning; (iii) improve program monitoring and evaluation; (iv) expand knowledge sharing and transfer of&#13;
new science-based innovations into watershed management; (v) support a stronger focus on improving agricultural productivity and market linkages; (vi) strengthen&#13;
watershed institutions at the national, state, and community level; and (vii) improve program equity and sustainability. The project would cover 400 sub-watersheds&#13;
and two million hectares across the eight states, and reach approximately 482,000 farmer households and 2 million people.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective is to support IWMP through technical assistance to improve incremental conservation outcomes and agricultural yields for communities in&#13;
selected sites, and adoption of more effective processes and technologies. Its four components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Central institutional and capacity building: Strengthens institutions and human resources of key national stakeholders, particularly the Department of Land&#13;
     Resources, for more effective planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of watershed management programs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    National innovation support: Supports the application of innovative, science-based knowledge, tools and approaches to underpin improvements to IWMP around&#13;
     watershed planning and implementation, agricultural intensification, climate change, rural livelihoods and hydrology, based on identified needs of the states,&#13;
     communities, and farmers.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    IWMP implementation support in participating states: Provides intensive, science-based technical assistance to improve IWMP operational effectiveness, conver-&#13;
     gence/integration with other government programs, and measurable impacts on the ground in selected sites in participating states.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management and coordination: Finances management and implementation costs, including specialized incremental staff costs (both full and part-time),&#13;
     incremental operating costs for travel (per World Bank norms), meetings, financial management, internal/external audit and procurement, equipment, and&#13;
     project management consultancies&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Conservation outcomes in selected micro-watersheds as measured by 50 percent reduction in soil loss over baseline of 3.3 tons/ha/year and incremental changes&#13;
     in overall watershed biomass to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index value of 1.01.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Average 25 percent gain in incremental productivity of arable lands across five crop types.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Three new approaches integrated into national watershed guidelines.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     More than 44 million people live in the North East region of India, 85 percent of whom live in rural areas, and 35 percent of whom are below the poverty line. Despite&#13;
     its rich natural resources and relatively good human development indicators, the region lags behind the rest of India in economic growth. The development challenge&#13;
     in the North East is compounded by geo-political isolation, protracted insurgency in some areas, and recurring natural disasters. Agriculture remains the backbone of&#13;
     the economy, contributing close to 30 percent of regional GDP and providing employment to over 75 percent of the people. The traditional jhum (shifting) cultivationâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
     the predominant agriculture production method in the regionâ&#128;&#148;is no longer economically and environmentally viable due to increasing population pressure and&#13;
     shorter fallow periods, which have led to reduced soil fertility and lower productivity. Despite the relatively high literacy rate, the region also suffers from an alarmingly&#13;
     high youth unemployment rate of 14 percent, mainly as a result of high drop-out rates and a lack of skills.&#13;
     Since 2000, the World Bank in India has supported empowerment and livelihood enhancement through seven state level projects, which have mobilized over&#13;
     30 million rural poor to enable them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. The programs have resulted in increased&#13;
     savings, improved access to credit, livelihoods, and public services, and have contributed to the social empowerment of the excluded castes and indigenous people.&#13;
     Experience from these projects, and from IFAD- financed projects in three north east states (Assam, Meghalaya, and Manipur), identified the need for: (i) effective skill&#13;
     development for youth; (ii) linking community-based organizations with wider markets; (iii) improving communitiesâ&#128;&#153; access to credit and other financial services by&#13;
     forming sustainable institutions for the poor; and iv) convergence with other government programs. The North East Rural Livelihoods Project aims to empower the rural&#13;
     poor and improve their livelihoods in the states of Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura.&#13;
     The development objective is to improve rural livelihoods, especially for women, unemployed youths, and the most disadvantaged, in the participating north eastern&#13;
     states. The project has four components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Social empowerment: Empowers the rural communities and creates sustainable institutions so they manage common activities around microfinance, livelihoods,&#13;
          and natural resource management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Economic Empowerment: Develops the capacity of rural communities to plan and manage funds for economic initiatives.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Partnership Development: Works with various service providers, resource institutions, and public- and private-sector organizations to bring finance, technology,&#13;
          and marketing support so that the community groups are able to improve their livelihoods.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project Management: Facilitates implementation, coordination, learning, and quality enhancement.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
     By project end, it is expected that:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    60 percent of female SHG members will increase their incomes by 30 percent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    30 percent of project-benefited unemployed youths will be employed; 1,750 youth already trained under the program and 65 placed in jobs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    50 percent of the most disadvantaged households will achieve a minimum of 30 percent improvement in livelihood indices.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    70 percent of the SHGs formed and supported by the project are institutionally sustainable.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    As of June 2014, 20,000 people, more than half of them females and predominantly from vulnerable and marginalized segment of society benefited directly&#13;
          from the project.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
On October 12, 2013, Cyclone Phailin hit a densely populated area of the state of Odisha, with 4.5 million people in the path of wind gusts up to 220 kilometers per&#13;
hour. It was the strongest cyclone to hit the Indian coast in 14 years: a category 4 storm similar to the Super Cyclone 05B of 1999 that hit Odisha and killed more than&#13;
10,000 people, destroyed 275,000 homes and left 1.67 million homeless. Due to a highly successful and unprecedented government response, only about 60 people&#13;
died in Cyclone Phailin, but the impact on coastal residents was extreme, particularly in the districts of Ganjam (where the cyclone made landfall), Puri, and Khordha.&#13;
Damage was estimated at about $1.45 billion, including some $480 million in needed housing reconstruction.&#13;
This project is part of a broader package to support the Government of Odishaâ&#128;&#153;s reconstruction and recovery efforts and to strengthen their capacity to manage future&#13;
events.&#13;
Its development objective is to restore and improve housing and public services in targeted communities of Odisha, and increase the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to respond&#13;
promptly and effectively to future emergencies. The project has five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Resilient housing reconstruction and community infrastructure: Focuses on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing, restoration of public buildings&#13;
     and public service networks using resilient construction standards, and development of village development plans.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Urban infrastructure in Berhampur: Focuses on Berhampur, the largest city in Ganjam district, to improve public services while at the same time reducing their&#13;
     vulnerability. It includes the upgrading of affected slums and technical assistance for the Berhampur Municipal Corporation to improve resilience of public&#13;
     services and urban planning.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building in disaster risk management: Strengthens the stateâ&#128;&#153;s capacity in risk mitigation, preparedness, and disaster response.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation: Supports the incremental operating costs of the project, including training, exposure visits, and knowledge exchange programs for the Odisha&#13;
     State Disaster Management Agency (OSDMA) and Berhampur.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Contingency emergency response: Can be triggered, at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural disaster to&#13;
     re-allocate project funds to support response and reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    30,000 affected households with resilient housing reconstructed, 200 village development plans completed, and improved living conditions for 25,000 vulner-&#13;
     able people in Berhampur.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    By the end of the project, the Berhampur Municipal Corporation will have master plans for drainage and sewerage, and the OSDMA will have an established&#13;
     Emergency Operations Center with trained staff and systems in place to plan for and respond to disasters.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The project combines rehabilitating community water tanks with strengthening water user associations (WUAs)_ and agricultural development in a single package&#13;
     to maximize the economic returns from scarce water resources. In addition to developing tested practices and processes that can be used to support development&#13;
     of tank-based livelihoods, the project will establish a nucleus of â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#157;good practiceâ&#128;&#157; water users associations that could then be used as learning and training centers at&#13;
     other tanks. The project provides integrated support to tank-based livelihoods and advances the concept of participatory water management. All successful practices&#13;
     developed and tested by the project will be embedded in the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s own work at other tanks.&#13;
     The development objective is to help tank-based producers to improve agricultural productivity, and help water user associations to manage tank systems effectively.&#13;
     The project covers 324 community tanks with a total command area of about 60,000 hectares, and expects to benefit over 150,000 farmers. Activities at each tank&#13;
     include the establishment and support to water users associations, rehabilitation and modernization of tanks and respective irrigation systems, and general support&#13;
     to agriculture development. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s three components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening: Enables community-based institutionsâ&#128;&#148;water users associations, fishing cooperative societies, farmer interest groupsâ&#128;&#148;to assume&#13;
          greater responsibility for tank system management and improving tank-based agricultural livelihoods.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Tanks systems and irrigation improvements: Improves the physical and operational performance of tank systems, ensures safe operation of tank structures, and&#13;
          enhances reliability of irrigation water supply by rehabilitating and modernizing tank systems that cover areas ranging from 40 to 2,000 hectares.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Agricultural livelihoods support services: Complements irrigation system rehabilitation works with the objective of enhancing the productivity of irrigated lands&#13;
          and increasing water use efficiency and/or cropping intensity.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVED RESULTS:&#13;
     Rehabilitation of about 61 tanks (18 percent) has been completed. Works on remaining tanks are under implementation. The main expected results at project&#13;
     completion are an increase in area irrigated, improved water availability for poor tail-end farmers, and an increase in value of output per unit of water. The district&#13;
     cluster teams have organized awareness campaigns, completed training modules and identified and trained 471 community resource persons. The training approach&#13;
     has been innovative, with the master trainers carrying out practical, hands-on training for each executive committee in their villages. An agricultural water management&#13;
     unit has been established and a detailed study carried out to understand how water is currently managed by WUAs. The project is supporting improved marketing&#13;
     initiatives, and has supported a banana and papaya value chain on 50 acres out of 300 acres owned, planted, and monitored exclusively by women groups. Similarly,&#13;
     an onion value chain is being implemented in 1,500 acres across two districts through small and marginal farmers. On the livestock front, about 439 women have&#13;
     been trained as poultry vaccinators and work for the concerned line department for vaccination and de-worming. The project has also shown encouraging progress is&#13;
     conducting demonstrations in improved fish production practices.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Orissaâ&#128;&#153;s 239,000-km road network is second only to Uttar Pradesh in terms of length. However, in terms of quality, Orissaâ&#128;&#153;s road network ranks among the lowestâ&#128;&#148;only&#13;
22 percent is paved, significantly below Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s average of 58 percent. The rationale for Bank support in Orissaâ&#128;&#153;s road sector is a logical extension of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s earlier&#13;
engagement in the state under the Orissa Socioeconomic Development Program (OSEDP), as well as the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s continued support to modernize Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s road sector.&#13;
The reforms implemented under the OSEDP have created substantial fiscal space for the state to undertake productive investments in social and infrastructure sectors.&#13;
However, despite the improved fiscal space, Orissa has not been able to meet its own targets for increasing capital investment to 3 percent (currently hovering around&#13;
2 percent) of GSDP. The project aims to assist Orissa in meeting the capital investment goals in a sector that is crucial for the stateâ&#128;&#153;s overall economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction objectives. In addition, the project would support the state government in implementing institutional and governance reforms in the road sector, thus&#13;
enhancing the efficacy of public-sector expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to remove transport bottlenecks in targeted transport corridors for greater investment and economic and social development&#13;
activities in the state of Orissa. The project was restructured to rationalize the project scope due to delayed implementationâ&#128;&#148;about 150 km roads were dropped from&#13;
the scope and $54 million was cancelled from the original loan size of $250 million.&#13;
&#13;
The project has two components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road corridor improvement: Supports the widening, strengthening, and selective realignment of 310 km of existing roads to double-lane standards.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Sector policy and institutional development, and implementation support: Assists the Government of Orissa in modernizing the Orissa Works Department (OWD)&#13;
     organization and capacity, improving the policy, institutional, and legal framework of the state road sector, and implementing and monitoring the project.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
By project completion, businesses and households in project areas will enjoy a significant reduction in generalized transport cost, and the OWD will improve its capacity&#13;
and efficiency to provide sustainable road infrastructure service to users. The outcome will be monitored by the following indicators:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Vehicle operating costs in project corridors to reduce.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Vehicle speed in project corridors to increase.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Established in 2000, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)â&#128;&#148;also known as the Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Rural Roads Programâ&#128;&#148;addresses poor rural connectivity.&#13;
     The program originally sought to provide all-season road access for every community with a population greater than 1,000 by 2003, and all villages with populations&#13;
     greater than 500 by the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan in 2007. The time frame for the program has now been extended, and the length of the new and improved rural&#13;
     road network increased to 274,000 km. As a result, 70,500 habitations are now connected. The programâ&#128;&#153;s implementation capacity has been enhanced significantly,&#13;
     with over 50,000 km of road being completed annually, compared to just 15,500 km at the beginning of the program. Despite these dramatic improvements in rural&#13;
     connectivity over the last decade, 25 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s villages still lack access to all-season roads. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s $1.54 billion PMGSY Rural Roads Project covers a mixture&#13;
     of low-income states (Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), small special category upland states (Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Uttarakhand), and the&#13;
     middle-income state of Punjab.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to support strengthening the systems and processes of the national PMGSY rural roads program to expand and maintain all-&#13;
     season rural access roads, resulting in enhanced road connectivity to economic opportunities and social services for beneficiary communities in the participating states.&#13;
     The project is structured around two components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    PMGSY program financing contributes finances to cover civil works expenditures in the seven participating states associated with providing new all-season access&#13;
          to unconnected habitations, and upgrading important link routes in rural areas. The project will strengthen implementation efficiency and the sustainability of&#13;
          program roads through improved maintenance.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening supports technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of relevant agencies to implement the program, including support for further&#13;
          enhancements to the On-line Management, Monitoring, and Accounting System to produce customized performance reporting at the national, state, and district&#13;
          levels. The reports will incorporate improved safeguards monitoring information and vulnerability-disaggregated data (including by gender), as well as data&#13;
          derived from third-party monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The share of rural population with access to all-season roads in participating states is expected to increase from 67 percent in 2011 to 72 percent by 2015.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The condition of PMGSY roads will improve. Road condition is measured through a Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which is a five-point scale where a number&#13;
          of two or lower is considered a satisfactory condition. Currently, 12 to 80 percent of the road networks in the participating states, where there is information, have&#13;
          PCI levels less than two. The project target is to have accurate condition data for all project states, and an average of 55 percent of the road network with a PCI of&#13;
          less than two.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Punjab state had implemented an IDA-assisted Rural Water project (P090592; $154 million) during 2007-14 that demonstrated good service levels through&#13;
community management while achieving close to 100 percent coverage of water supply. However, the state faces challenges of poor accessâ&#128;&#148;less than 30 percent&#13;
households have water connections and 600,000 households do not have access to sanitation facilities. This is mainly impacting women and children and marginalized&#13;
communities. The state government intends to scale up and consolidate the gains of the first project by adopting a demand responsive and decentralized service&#13;
delivery approach to progressively raise the water and sanitation service standards and coverage, and also reform the service delivery institutions.&#13;
This IBRD-financed Rural Water Sector Improvement Project includes:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Augmentation and operational improvement of existing water supply schemes to deliver better service levels through community management (970 villages;&#13;
     $77 million).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Sewerage schemes (315 villages; $90 million).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Individual household water connections (650,000; $18 million)&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Addressing water quality issues such as contamination with heavy metals (271 villages; $59 million)&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Making the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) though supporting beneficiaries to build individual household toilets (620,000) complimented with behavior&#13;
     change activities ($60 million).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Reforming the sector institution for improved service delivery and project management ($49 million),&#13;
The development objective of the project is to â&#128;&#156;improve water and sanitation service levels, reduce open defecation, and strengthen service delivery arrangements in&#13;
targeted villages in Punjabâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Villages with higher service levels managed by the Gram Panchayat Water Sanitation Committees.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Village committees that are managing operations and maintenance of water supply schemes through full cost recovery.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Villages declared ODF.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Villages receiving improved quality of water.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    New piped household water connections that are resulting from the project intervention.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Piped water connections that are benefited from rehabilitation works undertaken by the project.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Punjab, located in the northwest, is one of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s most prosperous states. The agricultural revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and resulting high economic growth&#13;
     substantially improved Punjabâ&#128;&#153;s poverty and social indicators. Punjab is rural and landlocked. Two-thirds of its 25 million people live in villages, and agriculture, directly&#13;
     or indirectly, accounts for 40 percent of the economy, substantially above the Indian average of 24 percent. Better roads, lower transport costs, and higher transport&#13;
     service standards have been identified in the government of Punjabâ&#128;&#153;s 10th Five-Year Plan as core elements of an enabling investment climate and a prerequisite&#13;
     for economic diversification and accelerated economic growth. While maintenance funding for national highways by the Government of India and for village roads&#13;
     through crop tax is sufficient, funding for the state highways has been grossly inadequate. (Until recently, funding for maintenance for Plans Roads was only 25 percent&#13;
     of that required). While funding for maintenance appears assured in the short term, the consequences from the previous inadequate maintenance funding and lack of&#13;
     capacity expansion can be only partially remediated. The Bank is supporting the road sector in Punjab because of the need to address the increasingly serious capacity&#13;
     constraints and to assist the Government of Punjab in strengthening its road maintenance management of the state highways.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve operating conditions of state roads for road users, in a sustainable way, thus helping to provide the business enabling&#13;
     environment necessary to support Punjabâ&#128;&#153;s economic development strategy. The project has two components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance: Finances civil works along plan roads comprising upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance of about 1,000&#13;
          km of roads; technical assistance; land acquisition; and the required pre-construction activities.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening: Funds measures for sector modernization and for improving sector efficiency, as well as for road safety and HIV/AIDS.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    30 percent increase in the average speed of the network.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    20 percent reduction in vehicle operating costs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved road safety resulting in fewer fatal accidents.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The desert state of Rajasthan faces acute water quantity and quality issues. Covering 10 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s land area and accounting for 5 percent of the population,&#13;
Rajasthan has less than 2 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s water resources. Erratic rainfall and recurring droughts have exacerbated the situation. A large part of the state relies&#13;
on groundwater for agriculture, and for industrial and domestic consumption, which has negative impacts on the quality and quantity of groundwater. Sustainable and&#13;
efficient use of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s scarce water resources is a major challenge. Given the size of the agriculture sector and its water footprint, improved water and agriculture&#13;
productivity coupled with market linkages are key elements for sustainable and inclusive growth. While there are many challenges to making the semi-arid dessert&#13;
bloom, there are also significant opportunities: (i) a promising potential for diversification into higher-value, less water-consuming horticulture, floriculture, spice&#13;
and medicinal plant production; (ii) scope for livestock development focusing on improved breeding, animal health, nutrition, and access to markets; (iii) availability&#13;
of a range of tested on-farm water management technologies and agronomic practices; (iv) a policy framework that is increasingly conducive to private sector-led,&#13;
sustainable agriculture, including recently revised state policies on agriculture, livestock, and agribusiness development, as well as water resources management; and&#13;
(v) the possibility of scaling up experience in PPPs in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective of the project is to establish the feasibility of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farmer incomes through a distinct&#13;
agricultural development approach that integrates agriculture water management and agricultural technology, farmer organizations, and market innovations in&#13;
selected locations across the 10 agro-ecological zones of Rajasthan. The project has four components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Climate resilient agriculture: Supports climate-resilient approaches for sustainable use of the natural resource base, through agricultural and livestock production&#13;
     systems aiming to increase long-term productivity and farm incomes in an environment marked by increased climate and rainfall variability. Activities include: (i)&#13;
     harvest, capture, collection, delivery, and distribution of water for agriculture and livestock purposes in surface water-irrigated canal command areas, groundwater&#13;
     sources, and rain-fed areas; (ii) on-farm water use efficiency; (iii) soil moisture and fertility improvements; (iv) sustainable intensification and diversification of&#13;
     farm production; and (v) integrated crop and livestock farming systems.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Markets and value chains: Will enable farmers to engage in profitable and sustainable market-oriented production, and promote partnerships and market link-&#13;
     ages with other value chain participants and agribusinesses.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Farmerâ&#128;&#153;s organizations and capacity building: Supports: (i) establishment of farmer groups and organizations; (ii) capacity building for participatory planning and&#13;
     plan implementation of collective actions; and (iii) strengthening institutions and human resources associated with the project implementation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Monitoring and evaluation, and learning: Aims to implement robust monitoring and evaluation systems, which will support potentially scaling up successful&#13;
     approaches across the state. Work will also focus on strengthening synergies, and convergence with ongoing schemes of the government of Rajasthan and the&#13;
     Government of India.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The project is in its first year of implementation, so progress on achieving results is not yet discernible. By the end of the project in 2019, however, it is expected that:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Water used in agriculture will be reduced by 15 percent (from 3,000 cum to 2,550 cum per gross irrigated area).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Water use efficiency will increase by 65 percent over the baseline.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Rajasthan is one of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest states, accounting for 10 percent of its total area and 5 percent of the population. The state has good potential for growth in&#13;
     agriculture and agro-based industries, mining and minerals processing, tourism, handicrafts, and cottage industries. But this potential is not being realized due to&#13;
     inadequate road infrastructure and market linkages. Rajasthan has a road network of 193,017 km. This includes 7,260 km of national highways (NH), 10,953 km of&#13;
     state highways (SH), 9,900 km of major district roads (MDR), 25,033 km of other district roads (ODR) and 139,871 km of village/rural roads. Due to years of under-&#13;
     investment and inadequate maintenance, many of the SHs and MDRs are in poor condition in terms of riding quality, geometry, pavement strength, drainage, and&#13;
     safety standards, and are disjointed due to missing links and dilapidated bridges. Only about 11 percent of SHs and MDRs are double lane. The road safety situation in&#13;
     Rajasthan is serious and deteriorating. The Severity Index of Rajasthan roads is about 40 compared to a national average of 29 and it ranked fifth in the total number of&#13;
     fatalities in 2011, contributing 6.5 percent of all fatalities in India. The PMGSY rural roads project, established in 2000, provided all weather road connectivity to about&#13;
     81 percent of eligible habitations of above 500 people, and to habitations of 250 people or more in desert and tribal areas of the state. About 7,357 habitations not&#13;
     meeting the PMGSY criteria are yet to be connected under the Rajasthan Road Sector Modernization Project.&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve rural connectivity, enhance road safety, and strengthen road sector management capacity of the state of Rajasthan.&#13;
     Its components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Rural connectivity improvement: Supports construction of about 2,500 km rural roads to provide connectivity to about 1,300 revenue villages with population&#13;
          between 250 and 499 people in the areas of the state not covered by PMGSY, and introduces good practices of cost-effective low-volume technologies.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Road sector modernization and performance enhancement: This component will support implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan in the areas of:&#13;
          (i) improved policy framework; (ii) modernization of engineering practices and business procedures; (iii) sustainable asset management; (iv) institutional and&#13;
          human resource development; (v) preparing a pipeline of feasible projects for implementation and; (vi) enhancing governance and accountability in the Public&#13;
          Works Department&#13;
&#13;
     KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    An increased share of rural population with access to an all-season road.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Increased percentage of Core Road Network in good/fair condition.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    A reduction in annual fatality count on model road safety corridors.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Rajasthan is Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest state in terms of area, and is eighth out of 28 states in terms of both population and state GDP. More than three-quarters of the population&#13;
live in rural areas. Despite a rapid decline in poverty, from 50 percent in 1970 to about 24 percent in 2005, more than two million people rank as absolute poor&#13;
according to the 2002 census. The highest incidence of poverty and vulnerability occurs in southern and eastern Rajasthan, with human development indicators lowest&#13;
in southern Rajasthan, where periodic drought cycles have led to significant seasonal out-migration. The Rajasthan Rural Livelihoods Project focuses on 17 districts in&#13;
southern and eastern Rajasthan.&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to enhance economic opportunities and empowerment of the rural poor, with a focus on women and marginalized groups, in&#13;
the 17 targeted districts. The project has five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Institution building and social empowerment: Helps the poor mobilize themselves into SHGs and develop their capacity to initiate and expand sustainable&#13;
      livelihoods activities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Community investment support: Supports asset creation of SHGs and their federations; and identifies and supports innovative approaches to improve livelihoods&#13;
      of the rural poor.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Skill development and employment promotion: Supports helping beneficiaries to connect to new employment opportunities by creating a structured mecha-&#13;
      nism for skill development and job creation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Climate change adaptation: Aims to develop drought adaptation mechanisms and institutional models at the district and local levels.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Project implementation support: Facilitates various implementation, coordination, learning, and quality-enhancement efforts.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     400,000 poor rural households mobilized into 33,000 SHGs. As of January 2014, a total of 9,000 SHGs have been promoted; disbursements to these groups&#13;
      under the project have started and been made to 3,900 SHGs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Link 23,100 SHGs to banks to mobilize credit for poor households. 7,200 SHGs have been linked to banks.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Enhanced resilience to climate change shocks for poor households by developing and implementing drought-adaptation mechanisms at the state, district, and&#13;
      local levels.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     Increase in income, savings, and diversification of income sources for 70 percent of targeted poor households.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;     17,000 youth receive skill development training and are placed in jobs.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has prioritized four states (Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh) as a Phase I special focus program for rural&#13;
     water and sanitation in low-income states. The piped water and sanitation coverage in these four states is extremely low. Access to household piped water in Assam is&#13;
     6.8 percent; Bihar 3.7 percent; Jharkhand 2.6 percent; and Uttar Pradesh 20.5 percent. Access to household toilets is just 18 percent in Bihar; 8 percent in Jharkhand;&#13;
     and 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh. Although Assam has higher coverage, with 60 percent of households having access to toilets, about half of these are insanitary.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve piped water supply and sanitation services for selected rural communities in the target states through decentralized&#13;
     delivery systems and to increase the capacity of the participating states to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has four&#13;
     components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Capacity building and sector development will support the building of institutional capacity for implementing project activities, along with sector development&#13;
             studies to inform policy decisions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Infrastructure development will support investments for improving water supply and sanitation coverage, including construction of new infrastructure and reha-&#13;
             bilitation and augmentation of existing schemes.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;       Project management support includes project management support to the various entities at the national, state, district, and village levels for implementing the&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Private-sector microfinance institutions (MFIs) have made a significant contribution to promoting financial inclusion, particularly credit. Despite being a tiny fraction of&#13;
the banking system, they account for as much as 60 percent of small loan accounts in the entire banking system. The project was designed recognizing this contribution&#13;
and the potential for further scale-up, but also recognizing that the unprecedented growth in the sector could affect the quality of credit discipline and market behavior&#13;
on the part of some MFIs.&#13;
The objective of the project is to scale up access to sustainable microfinance services for the financially excluded, particularly in underserved areas of India, by introducing&#13;
innovative financial products and fostering transparency and responsible finance. While national in coverage, the project focuses on financially underserved states. So&#13;
far, several low-income states have been major recipients of project funding, though some funding has also gone to underserved households in southern states with&#13;
better financial access.&#13;
&#13;
KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS.&#13;
The project has made important contributions in promoting responsible microfinance in India, and over 12 million clients of project-funded MFIs have benefited from&#13;
a greater focus on responsible lending. Substantive sector-wide improvements facilitated by the project include: better data transparency; stronger grievance-redressal&#13;
systems; enhanced systems for client protection; establishment of a sector-wide code of conduct; and substantially improved use of credit market infrastructure.&#13;
A recent achievement has been the launch of a web-based data platform that will provide quarterly operational data and annual financial data on MFIs. Further&#13;
applications, such as â&#128;&#156;heat maps,â&#128;&#157; which geo-map and highlight areas of risk, are proposed to be added to the platform.&#13;
&#13;
Project funding has also helped scale up sustainable microfinance, directly funding 568,000 clients for micro-enterprise or consumption needs, through 12 MFIs, 11 of&#13;
which are operationally self-sustainable. Around 80 percent of clients are in underserved states, including in low-income states such as Bihar and Orissa, West Bengal,&#13;
Rajasthan, and the North Eastern states. Project resources have been leveragedâ&#128;&#148;in 2013 alone, just in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s low-income states, funding was leveraged over 10 times&#13;
by partner MFIs that lent over $1.3 billion to microfinance clients in those states.&#13;
&#13;
Progress on project outcome indicators and implementation continues to be satisfactory. Progress on indicators related to leveraging project funding by other resources,&#13;
targeting project funding to underserved areas, sustainability of funded MFI operations, and data transparency has been impressive and exceeds the project targets.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The government of Kerala has significantly improved rural water supply coverage, from 58.6 percent in 2003 to 67.7 percent by 2010. Kerala has also achieved impressive&#13;
coverage of household sanitation: 95 percent of rural households have access to a toilet facility, and 87 percent of GPs have received the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Clean Village&#13;
Awardâ&#128;&#157; for 100 percent ODF status. Nevertheless, rural households disproportionally remain without adequate water supply, and the access gap between rural and urban&#13;
areas needs to be bridged. The gap is particularly acute in remote villages and areas with low quantity and poor quality of water. Challenges include: increasing presence&#13;
of fluoride, iron, and salinity; contamination of private drinking wells due to poor sanitation; emergence of water-stressed areas where demand outstrips local supply;&#13;
increasing numbers of â&#128;&#156;slipped backâ&#128;&#157; habitations; continued dependence of large number of households on private open wells that dry up in the summer; and low coverage&#13;
of household connections from piped water systems.&#13;
The development objective of the Second Kerala Rural Water and Sanitation Project (also known as Jalanidhi II) is to increase the access of rural communities to improved and&#13;
sustainable water supply and sanitation services in Kerala, using a decentralized, demand-responsive approach. The project has three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Institution building: Supports the capacity building of sector institutions and support organizations, assists the Government of Kerala in implementing a statewide&#13;
     sector-development program, and supports project management costs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance: Provides technical assistance to implementing agencies to ensure that infrastructure investments under the third component are properly imple-&#13;
     mented and resulting services efficiently provided.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Infrastructure development: Finances implementation of investments for: (i) new and rehabilitated intra-GP rural water supply schemes; (ii) pilot rehabilitation and&#13;
     modernization of multi-GP water supply schemes and transfer of internal distribution to GPs; and (iii) sanitation schemes, mainly covering community-centric solid and&#13;
     liquid waste management and household sanitation solutions in difficult terrain.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.&#13;
Water supply interventions under the project will benefit some 288,000 households, or 1.15 million people, and some 690,000 people will benefit from improved sanitation&#13;
services. Even in early stages of implementation, the project has begun to yield promising results:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    As of September 2014, 210,000 direct project beneficiaries (of which 60 percent are women, 47 percent are below the poverty line, 9 percent are members of Scheduled&#13;
     Castes, and 5 percent are members of Scheduled Tribes.)&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    145 water supply schemes have been completed and commissioned, of which 23 are rehabilitated schemes and the rest are small water supply schemes. One large&#13;
     multi-GP scheme covering six GPs in the Mala constituency of the Trichur district is under rehabilitation. Additional large water supply schemes have been initiated by&#13;
     the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (KRWSA) and Kerala Water Authority (KWA).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    An estimated 49,679 households have been covered with clean water supply and sanitation through 22 Batch I GPs. Water supply and sanitation activities have been&#13;
     initiated in 65 Batch II GPs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    As of May 2014, 192,300 additional people have access to improved sanitation facilities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Beneficiaries and GP contributions are $3.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Preparation of water security plans for Batch-I GPs has been completed.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The Government of Kerala has approved a special project of $2.1 million for implementing rain water harvesting in selected six GPs through KRWSA, demonstrating&#13;
     commitment toward sustaining the agency beyond the project.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Some GPs are undertaking ground water recharge activities through convergence of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and&#13;
     project resources.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Other sanitation interventions under implementation include; (i) application of new technologies for latrine solutions in water logged areas; (ii) construction of pay&#13;
     and use latrines in markets, bus stands, tourist spots, and for migrant populations; and (iii) interventions for safe disposal of solid and liquid waste at household and&#13;
     community level.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The outstanding success of the Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s elementary education program, which increased enrollment rates to almost 100 percent, is putting pressure on&#13;
secondary education (grades 9 and 10). Secondary education needs to expand rapidly in response, while at the same time improving the quality of education: two&#13;
Indian states which participated in the OECD PISA assessment of 15-year-olds in mathematics, science, and reading, ranked at the very bottom of 70+ participating&#13;
countries/regions. The Government of India asked the Bank to support expansion and quality improvement in secondary education through the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s flagship&#13;
program, given our long history of support to elementary education. Since 2004, IDA has contributed close to $1.85 billion to the program in two phasesâ&#128;&#148;SSA Iâ&#128;&#147;2004-&#13;
2007 ($500 million), and SSA IIâ&#128;&#147;2008-2012 ($1.35 billion). The Secondary Education Program, like SSA, is also funded by DFID and the European Union (EU), though&#13;
total Development Partner contributions are about 10 percent of costs over five years. However, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial contribution enables it to support and influence&#13;
the shape of the whole multi-billion dollar program.&#13;
The project development objective is to help India achieve increased and more equitable access to good quality secondary education through support of the&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ongoing program for secondary education as delineated in the Rashtriya Madhyamki Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) Framework. The Framework is designed&#13;
to expand access, enhance equity, and improve the quality of secondary education; and in particular, support new innovations and expansion of promising pilot&#13;
programs. Quality improvement activities include teacher professional development, recruitment of additional teachers, and capacity building of local institutions&#13;
to support change. Access will be expanded through new and upgraded schools, especially in underserved areas, outreach to communities, more relevant learning&#13;
materials, and better teachers. Innovations will be supported through new activities of the RMSA program, with clear guidelines for application and appraisal of&#13;
proposals.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.&#13;
The RMSA program will contribute to the improvement of access, equity, and quality in secondary schools across India, preparing students for higher education and&#13;
eventually the job market. More specifically, performance indicators are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Enrollment of students in Grades IX and X will rise from 28.3 to 38.4 million.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Gender Parity Index in enrollment in schools covered by RMSA programs will increase from 0.94 to 0.97.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Gross graduation rate will increase from 74 to 86 percent.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s continuing urbanization and high economic growth over the last decade have led to an inevitable rise in ownership and use of motorized vehicles across the&#13;
     countryâ&#128;&#153;s cities and towns. Two-wheeler (e.g. mopeds, motorcycles) and car ownership in cities has grown by double digits. This growing motorization, already well&#13;
     underway, may be exacerbated by the ongoing expansion of urban and industrialized areas as well as rising incomes. The result is additional stress on availableâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
     often limitedâ&#128;&#148;transport infrastructure, and on the institutions in charge of road construction and maintenance, traffic management, road safety, and public transport&#13;
     services. As more and more cars and two-wheelers hit the streets, city centers become congested, road safety deteriorates, and the environment suffers as GHG&#13;
     emissions increase. While the urban transport sector accounts for less than 10 percent of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s total emissions, it is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of&#13;
     fossil fuel consumption. Without timely interventions to develop and provide attractive alternatives to personal modes of transport, the situation is likely to worsen.&#13;
     With support from the GEF,, the Bank, in partnership with United Nations Development Program (UNDP), has been supporting the Ministry of Urban Development&#13;
     since 2006 to develop and implement a Sustainable Urban Transport Program, which aims to strengthen national and local government capacity in urban transport&#13;
     planning and management in a more integrated and comprehensive manner. The project supports the implementation of the India National Urban Transport Policy.&#13;
     The project development objective and global environment objective is to promote environmentally sustainable urban transport in India, and to improve the use of&#13;
     environment-friendly transport through demonstration projects in selected cities. The project has two components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity development assistance for urban transport: Provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Urban Development to improve national, state and local&#13;
          capacity to implement the National Urban Transport Policy.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    City demonstration projects: Will catalyze high profile-high impact projects in five cities (Pimpri-Chinchwad in Maharashtra, Naya Raipur in Chhattisgarh, Indore&#13;
          in Madhya Pradesh, and Hubli-Dharwad and Mysore in Karnataka. These demonstration projects focus on: public transport, non-motorized transport, and a pilot&#13;
          Intelligent Transport System (ITS). City projects include:&#13;
           â&#150; â&#150;  Pimpri-Chinchwad: A Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) along two corridors.&#13;
           â&#150; â&#150;  Naya Raipur: BRTS Lite between Raipur and Naya Raipur and within Naya Raipur, and pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in the city.&#13;
           â&#150; â&#150;  Hubli-Dharwad: A BRTS corridor along with associated public transport infrastructure and passenger access improvements.&#13;
           â&#150; â&#150;  Mysore: ITS including Passenger Information System and Automatic Vehicle Location Systems for city bus service.&#13;
           â&#150; â&#150;  Indore: ITS for BRTS, including Automatic Fare Collection System and Traffic Signal Priority.&#13;
     In 2013, the demonstration project in Pune was cancelled and the project in Hubli-Dharwad was formally inducted into SUTP.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.&#13;
     At project end, this transport project will create better urban transport project preparation and implementation capacities, and will catalyze many more sustainable&#13;
     public and non-motorized transport projects across the country. The implementation of the ITS project in Mysore, involving user-friendly Passenger Information&#13;
     Systems and an Automatic Vehicle Location System, has recently been completed. The Leaders in Urban Transport Planning training program for ensuring exposure&#13;
     of urban transport officials and decision makers to the complexities and multi-faceted nature of the issues, has been launched in partnership with MoUD and CEPT&#13;
     University in Ahmedabad. Two batches have undergone training at CEPT University, covering 64 officials from across the country, and another 60 officials have received&#13;
     training in Seoul and Singapore. The training has been well received and the target is to cover at least 200 officials around the country.&#13;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
In the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004, the World Bank supported Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery efforts, with the India - Emergency Tsunami&#13;
Reconstruction Project (ETRP) focused on the state of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The objective of the ETRP was to revive livelihoods and promote&#13;
recovery in Tsunami-affected areas. ETRP was restructured in August 2009, with the addition of a new component: Vulnerability Reduction of Coastal Communities&#13;
(VRCC). The VRCC extended the reconstruction program beyond those affected by the tsunami to the entire coast, targeting communities regularly exposed to cyclones,&#13;
storm surges, and coastal flooding (and potential tsunamis), as well as addressing these communitiesâ&#128;&#153; poor access to evacuation shelters and early warning systems.&#13;
When the restructured ETRP closed on December 31, 2011, several works were complete, several ongoing, and some had yet to be taken up.&#13;
&#13;
The Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project (CDRRP) focuses on new initiatives in risk reduction and mitigation, but also integrates the&#13;
previous ETRP.&#13;
&#13;
The CDRRP aims to increase the resilience of coastal communities in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to a range of hydro-meteorological and geophysical hazards, along with&#13;
improving the capacities of project implementation entities to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Vulnerability reduction of coastal communities through infrastructure such as permanent houses, evacuation shelters and routes, and a resilient electrical net-&#13;
     work.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Sustainable fisheries aims at upgrading infrastructure, sustainable co-management, and addressing safety at sea.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Capacity building focused on disaster risk management of government institutions, civil society, the school education system, and coastal communities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation support includes incremental operating costs for operating the project management unit and respective project implementation units in the&#13;
     line departments.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Contingency emergency financing will be drawn by the Government of Tamil Nadu and/or Puducherry to cover emergency response and recovery costs.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.&#13;
In Tamil Nadu:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Resilient Housingâ&#128;&#148;14,346 (99.9 percent) houses that were continuing from earlier ETRP Project are now complete.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    19 Multi-Purpose Evacuation Shelters (MPES) and all the Emergency Evacuation Routes are complete.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Modernization of fishing harbor: About 70 percent and 95 percent of the works have been completed in Nagapattinam and Pazhayar, respectively.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Fish Landing Centers: About 95 percent of the works have been completed at both Nagore and Portonovo- Annankoil.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Tamil Nadu has created the secretariat for the Disaster Management Authority as a society and recruitment of personnel is ongoing. It will be operational in about&#13;
     three monthsâ&#128;&#153; time.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    In Puducherry:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Resilient Housingâ&#128;&#148;1,448 houses were to be built under the ETRP project while 1,000 new reconstruction multi-resilient houses were added under this project&#13;
     CDRRP. Of the 1,448 multiâ&#128;&#147;hazard resilient houses taken up in ETRP, over 800 are complete while the work on new 1,000 houses is yet to start.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Fisheries infrastructure: 16 works shelters and one fish market have been completed. Works at Puducherry harbor are ongoing.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Tamil Nadu is Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s 11th largest state by area and the seventh most populous state. It is also one of the most industrialized states and had the countryâ&#128;&#153;s second&#13;
     largest economy in 2012. However, over 20 percent of the population continues to live in poverty, a situation which is particularly pronounced in rural areas with high&#13;
     inequality and a large disabled population. A large portion of the population depends on agricultural for their livelihoods, due to low skill levels and weak access to&#13;
     credit and markets with which to engage the growing non-farm sector.&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank has financed empowerment and livelihood projects in India since 2000, mobilizing over 30 million rural poor to form their own institutions and&#13;
     enabling them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. State level livelihood projects (in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,&#13;
     Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, and Bihar) have achieved significant results in terms of increased savings, access to credit, livelihoods, and the convergence of&#13;
     public services at the household level. This experience is now being scaled up across the country through the National Rural Livelihood Program, as well as to four states&#13;
     in the North East under the Bank-supported North East Rural Livelihood Project.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to empower the poor and enhance their livelihoods through the development of community-level institutions; to enhance skills&#13;
     and capacities of the poor (especially women, youth, the differently abled, and the vulnerable); and to finance demand-driven investments related to livelihoods for&#13;
     the target poor. The project has three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Village livelihoods program: Building institutional capacity, and funding productive livelihood-related investments at the village level.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    District and state support to village livelihoods program: Strengthening project teams at the state and district levels to extend support to the village level and&#13;
          support monitoring, evaluation, and learning.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project management: Includes staffing and human resource development.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.&#13;
     The original project covered 2,509 village panchayats and over 581,000 households in 16 districts of Tamil Nadu. The additional finance credit enables the project to&#13;
     expand to include another 1,665 village panchayats (388,000 households) spread across 10 new districts.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    More than 35,000 new SHGs have been formed by the project, with a particular focus on the poorest women and inclusion of youth, tribal populations, and&#13;
          the differently abled. The savings and internal lending of these SHGs have enabled members to enhance their livelihood activities and household incomes. By&#13;
          establishing Panchayat Level Federations, and clustering SHGs around economic activities, opportunities have been provided for improved access to services and&#13;
          markets. The total savings and credit available with SHGs is over $370 million, of which about 25 percent is from SHG savings.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Over 225,000 target youth have benefited from job-oriented skills training, with 82 percent now employed in corporate sectors including the construction indus-&#13;
          try, the service sector, telecommunications, and garment production.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Over 199,000 differently abled and vulnerable people have received individual assistance through the village institutions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Impact evaluation surveys of the original project districts are showing that the project has been successful in reducing the high cost debt burden, moving liveli-&#13;
          hood activities towards more skilled employment, and in the empowerment of women.&#13;

 Government of Tamil Nadu&#13;
 Total Project Cost&#13;
 *US$ millions; as of August 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The Highways Department (HD) of Tamil Nadu is responsible for managing about 62,000 km of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s road network, which comprises National Highways (4,974&#13;
km, 8 percent), State Highways (11,594 km, 18 percent), Major District Roads (11,289 km, 19 percent) and Other District Roads &amp; Sugarcane Roads (34,160 km, 55&#13;
percent). Over the last decade, the Government of Tamil Nadu and its HD has accomplished the following notable achievements: (i) enhanced the capacity and quality&#13;
of road network; (ii) increased the expenditure in the sector; (iii) enhanced allocations to maintenance of roads; and (iv) improved road safety performance through&#13;
launching of a Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Fund, increasing the number of patrol vehicles and removal of about 300 black-spots, and implementing a Road&#13;
Accident Database Management System (RADMS).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The road sector in Tamil Nadu is still facing three notable challenges: inadequate and suboptimal investments, insufficient implementation capacity and poor&#13;
     road safety. Over the last decade, the state government made significant progress in addressing these challenges. These challenges, however, remain due to the&#13;
     rapid economic growth of the state and the consequent increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for road transport.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Investments are lagging behind demand: During the last decade, while the length of the NH, SH and MDR in Tamil Nadu increased by about 50 percent, the&#13;
     number of registered vehicles in the state increased by 160 percent. According to the stateâ&#128;&#153;s Vision 2023 document, the road sector investment requirements&#13;
     over the next 10 years are estimated at INR 900 billion ($15 billion). As against these estimates, the annual capital expenditure for the entire sector currently&#13;
     stands at INR 24 billion ($400 million).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Sub-optimal expenditure patterns: In the recent years, a sizeable portion of the capex is being channeled towards the â&#128;&#152;lower-trafficâ&#128;&#153; rungs of the network. Such&#13;
     emphasis on capacity expansion of â&#128;&#152;lowerâ&#128;&#153; rungs of the network contributed to improved road access but it also resulted in underinvestment in capacity expansion&#13;
     of the â&#128;&#152;upperâ&#128;&#153; rungs of the network with high-traffic. Also, most capital expenditures are small-size, traditional item-rate contracts. Using this highly fragmented&#13;
     approach leaves a negligible impact and involves tackling a needy corridor through small stretches over several years.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Low implementation capacity: In recent years, the capacity of HD for managing upgradation activity has increased but only up to about 800 km/year whereas to&#13;
     be able to achieve the stateâ&#128;&#153;s Vision 2023 of upgrading about 20,000 km of roads over the next 10 years, HD would need to more than double its implementation&#13;
     capacity.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Road safety: Tamil Nadu currently ranks in the top five states in terms of road accidents, fatalities and injuries, accounting for about 13.8 percent of total accidents&#13;
     and 12 percent of people killed in road accidents in India. The stateâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to respond to the road safety challenge requires substantial augmentation across&#13;
     and through more coordinated involvement of multiple stakeholder departments such as transport, police, highways, health and education, not only at the state&#13;
     level but also at lower operational levels such as districts and corridors.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The project development objective is to increase road capacity, enhance quality of maintenance, improve safety and support institutional development of Tamil&#13;
     Naduâ&#128;&#153;s Core Road Network.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The expected results are: (i) upgrading and maintenance of about 575 km of highways through EPC and PPP contracts and long-term performance-based maintenance&#13;
of another 600 km of highways; (ii) reduced average travel time on project roads; (iii) reduced average vehicle operating cost on project roads; and (iv) no increase in&#13;
number of annual fatalities from road accidents on project roads.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     How India manages urbanization will be central to its efforts in alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s rapid economic growth is accompanied&#13;
     by an unprecedented spatial transformation. Compared to other Indian states, Tamil Nadu is highly urbanized and has the second largest state economy in India.&#13;
     Though Tamil Nadu is a pioneer in many aspects of urban development, there remains a huge unfinished reform and investment agenda. The critical importance of&#13;
     urban development is clearly spelt out in the Government of Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s latest Twelfth Five-Year Plan and its Vision 2023 that sets out the vision for the sector as to&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;promote and facilitate the development of inclusive and sustainable citiesâ&#128;&#157;. The Bank has had a long engagement with the state government in the urban sector,&#13;
     including through the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) type urban projects began with the setting up of the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) in the&#13;
     late 1990s under TNUDP II, followed by the TNUDP III that closed in 2014. The current TNSUDP is consistent with the Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s India Country Partnership Strategy&#13;
     (CPS) for FY 2013-2017, and contributes to the development goals set out under Engagement Area 2 of the CPS on â&#128;&#156;Spatial Transformationâ&#128;&#157; by seeking to leverage&#13;
     the rural-urban transformation as an opportunity to reduce poverty and increase competitiveness and supporting India and the state of Tamil Nadu in achieving the&#13;
     following Engagement Area 2 outcomes: (i) strengthened institutional capacity of urban governments; (ii) improved urban services; and (iii) improved environmental&#13;
     protection.&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve urban services in participating ULBs in a financially sustainable manner and to pilot improved urban management&#13;
     practices in selected cities. The project comprises three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Results based grants for urban governance will provide results-based grants to selected eligible ULBs to implement new urban-management models that&#13;
          strengthen governance and financial sustainability.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Investments in urban services will comprise three sub-components:&#13;
          Urban investments will provide investment support to participating ULBs for improvements in a range of urban services, including water, sewerage, municipal&#13;
          solid waste, urban transportation, septage management, and storm water drainage, as well as support project management and supervision. These will be based&#13;
          on demand from ULBs in the state, with an emphasis on â&#128;&#156;sustainabilityâ&#128;&#157; and improvement of the urban environment.&#13;
          Credit enhancement will create a reserve fund to provide credit enhancement support for municipal bonds and other market-based loan instruments issued by&#13;
          ULBs, as well as the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund (WSPF) of TNUDF. It will seek to further enhance Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s pioneering efforts in mobilizing resources&#13;
          for urban infrastructure from financial markets.&#13;
          Project development and TNUDF technical assistance would provide technical assistance to: (i) ULBs to prepare and implement sub-projects, including&#13;
          environmental and social mitigation actions, and PPP arrangements; (ii) ULBs to implement credit enhancement measures; (iii) CoC, for urban flood risk&#13;
          mitigation; and (iv) TNUDF, for institutional development.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Urban sector technical assistance is aimed at strengthening the stateâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to carry out urban finance and municipal governance reforms in: (i) developing&#13;
          next generation municipal e-governance and GIS systems for ULBs; (ii) institutional development and capacity building, including training, sector studies, opera-&#13;
          tions and maintenance, and strengthening public financial management at ULBs; and (iii) project management.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    At least 2 million people receive improved urban services as result of interventions under the project.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Out of such beneficiaries of improved urban services, at least 40 percent are female.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Additional financial resources mobilized by ULBs for urban infrastructure through non-budgetary sources to the extent of $80 million equivalent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Aggregate increase in Own Source Revenues (OSR) of â&#128;&#156;Model Citiesâ&#128;&#157; under urban governance component of over $12 million equivalent through implementa-&#13;
          tion of OSR improvement plans.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Two million urban residents of participating ULBs (at least 40 percent women) would benefit through improved urban services (water, waste-water, storm water&#13;
          drainage (and reduced flooding), city roads, etc).&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
India is one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest and most dynamic emerging markets with vast economic potential. However, GDP growth decreased from 10.5 percent in 2010&#13;
to 5 percent in 2013 (year-to-end as of March 2013). Looking to reverse these recent trends, the objective of the 12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013â&#128;&#147;2017) is to return to&#13;
GDP growth rates in excess of 8 percent. The manufacturing sector will have to play an important role in this endeavor as it has long been recognized as an essential&#13;
driver of economic development for most developing countries (e.g. it has an important economic and employment multiplier effect). Recognizing this potential, the&#13;
Government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Manufacturing Policy set the objective of â&#128;&#156;enhancing the share of manufacturing in GDP from its current level of 15 to 25 percent within&#13;
a decade and creating 100 million additional jobs.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
This programâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to enhance the productivity of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by improving their access to technology and&#13;
business advisory services, as well as skilled workers through systems of financially sustainable Technology Centers (TCs). The project is composed of three components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance to the existing and new TCs with respect to their technological and business needs under the guidance of Industry Specific Joint Working&#13;
     Groups comprising main industry leaders and representatives.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Investments to upgrade the 18 existing TCs (currently called Tool Rooms and Technology Development Centers) and develop 15 new TCs spanning 25 states,&#13;
     including at least eight in low-income states.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance to the MSME Ministry for project implementation support as well as monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Under retroactive financing, the program management consultant has been procured and the first bidding packages prepared before project signing expected within&#13;
weeks.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase number of paid services rendered by TCs to enterprises including placement services from a baseline of 23,000 to an end target of 60,000.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase number of long-term trainees employed in industry within six months of graduating from the TCs from 8,000 to 26,000 by 2020.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increase the TCsâ&#128;&#153; net profit before depreciation (not including land) from $3.5 million in 2012 to $12 million by 2020&#13;

      *US$ millions; as of August 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Telangana is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, prosperity is unevenly&#13;
     distributed: the poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. There are two&#13;
     main aspects of this challenge. First, there is an income deficit since the small and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted&#13;
     from the potential growth in the agriculture. This is primarily because they have not been able to take advantage of the potential benefits from the sub-sectors&#13;
     like horticulture, livestock and fisheries. The other deficit is the human development deficit, as most health and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. The&#13;
     income deficit and the human development deficit needed to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a greater pace of poverty reduction. Therefore,&#13;
     the project has been designed as a new generation multi-sectoral, rural-inclusive growth project that will work concurrently work on economic development, human&#13;
     development, and social protection areas with a strong focus on ICT. Given the multi-sectoral nature of the project within the Bank team, the project preparation&#13;
     involved active collaboration between a number of global practices like Agriculture, Health &amp; Nutrition, Social Protection, and Governance &amp; ICT. The project is also a&#13;
     new generation livelihood project and lessons from the project will be taken to the low-incomes state of Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where rural&#13;
     livelihood projects are currently operational.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to enable selected poor households to enhance agricultural incomes and secure increased access to human development services&#13;
     and social entitlements. The project has five components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and&#13;
          improved market access. This component will also invigorate local markets by connecting rural producers and enterprises with the rural consumers.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Human development: The focus here is to enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the HD sector, as well as to&#13;
          improve HD service delivery by strengthening the existing public systems to deliver quality services. The interventions will target health, nutrition, sanitation,&#13;
          and education.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Digital local government: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the poorest households, comple-&#13;
          menting the state governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to strengthen local government.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    ICT, TA and partnerships: ICT use especially open data systems and data analytics will be critical for the project. This component will create an enabling ecosystem&#13;
          for innovation and transformation in delivering high-quality, last-mile services planned under the other components. The project will make strategic investments&#13;
          in ICT especially open data systems and data analytics, provide technical assistance to line departments, and catalyze partnerships with public, private, and social&#13;
          enterprise sectors.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project implementation support: The objective of this component is to strengthen the project implementation by establishing MEL systems, financial manage-&#13;
          ment systems, procurement management, governance and accountability systems, and knowledge management and communication.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     The key expected results for the project are as follows:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Enhanced incomes for 250,000 producers in selected project mandals.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improved human development outcomes for 250,000 poor households though the adoption of appropriate health, nutrition and sanitation behaviors.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Enhanced access to social protection and entitlement programs for 500,000 poor households through systems that deliver improved information, enrollment&#13;
          and payments.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Background and Objectives: Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s main program for universalizing elementary education. Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Right of Children to Free and&#13;
Compulsory Education Act took effect in April 2010, making the provision of free and compulsory education of all children ages 6-14 a fundamental right. SSA has&#13;
been designated as the implementation vehicle for the act. The main challenge now is to improve pupil attendance and retention, and to focus on learning outcomes,&#13;
especially for the disadvantaged groups. To achieve this, special efforts are required to enhance social accountability, institutional reform, and governance for improved&#13;
service delivery. So far, SSA has been successful in increasing access and quality.&#13;
&#13;
The project supports the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s initiative to increase the focus on quality and strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems. It is expected to contribute directly&#13;
toward enhancing opportunities for disadvantaged children, providing them access to good quality education as well as the tools to combat poverty.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective is to improve education outcomes of elementary school children in India. The project focuses on three areas of engagement:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improving quality and enhancing learning outcomes: Provides special attention to quality improvement with inherent accountability measures to inform the SSA&#13;
     program in all its dimensions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening monitoring and evaluation for improved accountability: Supports a three-tier strategy for assessing learning outcomes for enhanced account-&#13;
     ability.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Enhancing access and retention for disadvantaged children: Makes special provisions to enroll marginalized children through special training centers to prepare&#13;
     them for grade and age appropriate education.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The project will directly benefit about 200 million children enrolled in elementary schools and 4.5 million teachers in the sector. Girls are expected to be about 48.4&#13;
percent of the beneficiaries. Achieving objectives will be measured by four indicators:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Increased attendance rates.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved retention rates.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Improved transition rates from primary to upper primary.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Learning levels adequately and regularly monitored.&#13;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Uttar Pradesh is Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s most populous state with an estimated population of nearly 200 million, or 17 percent of the population of India (Census 2011). Seventy-seven&#13;
     percent of the population lives in rural areas, and about 33 percent live below the poverty line. Uttar Pradesh has been ranked in the bottom third of Indian states on&#13;
     the Human Poverty Index since 1981, and the state lags behind all other states of the country on most human development indicators.&#13;
&#13;
     Uttar Pradesh will determine achievement of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s health goals and its health-related MDGs, given the size of the state population and the disproportionately&#13;
     higher mortality and morbidity rates. Public health spending has been steadily increasing in the state and is no longer the binding constraint. Despite increasing&#13;
     government, donor, and private investments in the health sector in Uttar Pradesh, the main challenges that are undermining the full impact of the inputs are centered&#13;
     on inadequate organizational performance. The Bank-financed project is expected to leverage its resources to support the Government of Uttar Pradesh to improve the&#13;
     efficiency of the health system and enhance the effectiveness of public investment in the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
     The development objective of the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Strengthening Project is to improve the efficiency, quality, and accountability of health services delivery&#13;
     in the state by strengthening the state Health Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s management and systems capacity. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s two components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening the Department of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s management and accountability systems: Supports: (i) strengthening strategic planning functions; (ii) improving use&#13;
          of data for program management; (iii) strengthening the use of financial information for improved decision making, and strengthening of procurement and&#13;
          supply chain management systems; and (iv) introducing and strengthening social accountability mechanisms and introducing provider incentives in the public&#13;
          sector, and evaluating their impact.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improving the Department of Healthâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to perform its quality assurance role and more effectively engage the private sector: Supports: (i) strengthening&#13;
          the institutional capacity for service-quality improvement and regulatory capacity by establishing Quality Assurance, Environment Management, and PPP cells&#13;
          in the Directorate of Health; (ii) hospital accreditation under the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals; (iii) contracting with the private sector for delivery of&#13;
          diagnostic services and non-clinical support services; and (iv) strengthening human resources management and availability.&#13;
     The project disburses a third of the credit against results met in pre-agreed indicators (disbursement linked indicators); it uses a technical assistance provider and works&#13;
     through the regular client systems, with necessary risk mitigation.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Creation and staffing of key cells in the Health Directorate.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Supporting the government in its development of a draft health PPP policy, and on strengthening procurement and supply chain management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Development of drug stock indenting and supply chain management software for all districts, and training staff to use it.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Identification of facilities for accreditation and a gap assessment for all hospitals underway.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Development and piloting of a draft health report card.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Development of draft bidding documents and contracts for housekeeping and diagnostics.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
With a population of approximately 200 million, Uttar Pradesh lags behind most Indian states across a number of human development indicators. Currently, over 50&#13;
million people live below the poverty line with a large majority living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of the state GDP and 60 percent of the&#13;
total employment. Rural people are especially dependent on agriculture as a source of labor and livelihoods. The project aims to help build the institutional capacity of&#13;
water-related institutionsâ&#128;&#148;institutions needed to increase agricultural productivity in this low-income state where agriculture will continue to play an important role in&#13;
alleviating poverty. Under the Phase 1 operation, irrigation and drainage systems covering about 3 percent of the irrigated area (343,000 hectares) were rehabilitated&#13;
and modernized in the pilot Jaunpur Branch basin using modern surveys and designs. More than 800 WUAs were established and strengthened following the passing&#13;
of the seminal Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Act (2009). Other achievements include a state-level water resource agency and introduction of&#13;
a management information system for the state Irrigation Department. Phase 2 will rehabilitate and modernize critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure in&#13;
identified areas, consolidate and deepen various institutional reforms established under Phase 1, and refocus on water-saving agricultural activities through farmer&#13;
water schools and joint activities between the Irrigation and Agriculture departments.&#13;
&#13;
The Project development objective is to: (i) strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated water resources management for the entire state; and (ii)&#13;
increase agricultural productivity and water productivity by supporting farmers in targeted irrigation areas. The project comprises five components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening of state-level water institutions and inter-sector coordination: This component aims to provide support to the institutions in the state responsible&#13;
     for overall integrated water resources management and implementation of the State Water Policy.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems: This component is the major infrastructure component and aims to improve the system&#13;
     performance of key canal systems in the state through modernization and rehabilitation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Consolidation and Enhancement of Irrigation Institutional Reforms: This component aims to enhance the efficiency of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department&#13;
     and strengthen the participatory irrigation management approach (through WUAs).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Enhancing agriculture productivity and on-farm water management: This component aims to improve the overall agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency&#13;
     at the field level.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Feasibility studies and preparation activities for the next phase: This component is to prepare detailed surveys and designs for future phases.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project Coordination and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The following results are expected to be achieved during the first year of project implementation:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    50 percent completion of the Parallel Lower Ganga Canal and three reservoir systems in the Bundelkhand.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    75 percent preparation of package A, B, and C survey, design, and bidding documents.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    State Water Agency major consultancy draft reports (including flood forecasting tools).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    At least one cycle of farmer water schools and associated agriculture investments.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    WUA elections held and completed for year-1 investment areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Irrigation Department real-time monitoring systems installed in year one investment areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Rehabilitation and modernization works have commenced in two major irrigation systems (on the Parallel Lower Ganga Canal and in Bundelkhand) and the&#13;
     survey and design consultancies for the remaining works packages have been mobilized and are starting the field surveys.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India. It is also one of the poorest, with an annual per capita income of $436 in 2011, compared to $1,410 nationally:&#13;
     almost 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Agriculture is a crucial sector for the state. Eighty percent of the population is rural and highly&#13;
     dependent on agricultural production for their livelihoods; agriculture employs about 66 percent of the labor force, primarily in rice and wheat cultivation. Yet the&#13;
     stateâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture suffers from productivity gaps of more than 50 percent in key crops, such as rice and wheat.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank-supported Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Reclamation Project-III builds on the lessons learned from two predecessor projects that reclaimed about 255,000&#13;
     hectares of sodic lands from 1993 to 2007. The ongoing project aims to sustainably reclaim another 130,000 ha covering 25 districts of predominantly barren and low-&#13;
     productivity sodic lands. This would improve household food security through increased productivity and cropping intensity. By focusing on degraded lands cultivated&#13;
     by poor farmers, the project contributes to sustainable poverty alleviation. The Bank has been the Government of Uttar Pradeshâ&#128;&#153;s key partner in sodic land reclamation&#13;
     for the last 15 years and has helped develop and refine the intervention model, including institutional development at the state and user levels.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to increase agricultural productivity of degraded lands in selected areas of Uttar Pradesh by reversing water-induced land&#13;
     degradation, enhancing soil fertility, and improving the provision of agriculture support services. The project has five components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    On-farm development and land treatment: Aims to sustainably reverse water-induced land degradationâ&#128;&#148;salinization, sodification, and water-loggingâ&#128;&#148;through&#13;
          carefully sequenced technical interventions.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Improvement of drainage systems: Aims to improve the drainage networks in the project area to remove/leach effluents, excess rain, and irrigation water from&#13;
          reclaimed and adjoining areas.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Agriculture support services: Aims to increase agricultural productivity by introducing improved technology, better agronomic practices, and more effective provi-&#13;
          sion of key support services.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Institutional strengthening and capacity building for market access: Improves the profitability of farm production and enhances livelihoods of the poor by creat-&#13;
          ing better input-output market linkages and more efficient and effective delivery of key support services, and strengthening community-level capacities and&#13;
          provision of some productive infrastructure.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Project management: Aims to ensure smooth implementation of all project activities, monitoring of project implementation progress and outputs/outcomes, and&#13;
          learning from project experience.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Over 92,000 ha of sodic land have been reclaimed, against an end of project target of 130,000.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Over 4,000 ha of ravine land have also been reclaimed, against a target of 5,000.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The productivity of the reclaimed sodic lands has increased to nearly 6.5 tons per ha and the cropping intensity to 200 percent. A majority of these lands had been&#13;
          previously barren. On both these fronts (productivity and cropping intensity), the mid-term achievements have exceeded the targets.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The annual crop income per household, at nearly $700, has exceeded the end of project target.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project continues to have an inclusive, pro-poor character: 93 percent of beneficiaries are small and marginal farmers, and 80 percent of beneficiaries belong&#13;
          to backward castes, which constitute the most marginalized communities. The project has enabled nearly 40,000 landless and marginal farmers (37.5 percent of&#13;
          total beneficiaries) to obtain secure tenure and possession of land (some 17,000 ha). Of this, over 3,000 beneficiaries have been allotted new land.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
In June 2013 the monsoon arrived almost two weeks earlier than expected in the state of Uttarakhand, located in northern Himalayan region of India. From June 15&#13;
to 17, 2013, an extreme amount of precipitation (124.5 â&#128;&#147; 244.4 mm) hit several parts of the higher reaches of the Himalayas. This unprecedented rainfall resulted in&#13;
a sudden increase in water levels, giving rise to flash floods in the Mandakini, Alakananda, Bhagirathi and other river basins, while also causing extensive landslides&#13;
at various locations. According to official sources, over 900,000 people have been affected by the event. This region is one of the most important pilgrimage circuits in&#13;
India. Since the disaster coincided with the peak tourist and pilgrimage season, it significantly increased the number of casualties, missing, and affected population.&#13;
More than 4,000 lives were lost, 4,200 villages were affected, about 3,320 houses and 995 public buildings were damaged, and close to 9,000km of roads were&#13;
affected.&#13;
Uttarakhand is also in a zone highly prone to natural disasters. The entire state falls within Zone IV and V (V represents the highest level of seismicity) of the Earthquake&#13;
Zoning Map of India. In the recent past, the state has witnessed two major earthquakes (Uttarkashi 1991 and Chamoli 1999). Every year, the state faces losses,&#13;
particularly during the monsoon, due to rains, cloudbursts, landslides, floods, hailstorms, and waterlogging events. The Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project supports&#13;
the Government of Uttarakhand for risk and vulnerability reduction, with assistance for reconstructing damaged infrastructure, restoring connectivity, and improving&#13;
technical support for managing future disaster risks.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective of the project is to restore housing, rural connectivity and build resilience of communities in Uttarakhand and increase the technical&#13;
capacity of state entities to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has the following components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Resilient infrastructure reconstruction focusing on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing and restoration of public buildings essential for public&#13;
     services using resilient construction standards under an owner-driven reconstruction modality.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Rural road connectivity focusing on restoring the connectivity, providing access to markets as well as health and education services, through the reconstruction&#13;
     of damaged roads and bridges with upgraded designs to withstand earthquake and flood forces as per the latest official design guidelines, including improved&#13;
     drainage and slope stabilization.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Technical assistance and capacity building for disaster risk management to enhance the capabilities of government entities in risk mitigation and response,&#13;
     including: risk modeling and assessment; establishing a decision support system; strengthening early warning systems and response capacity; and to finance&#13;
     relevant studies to better understand and manage natural disaster risks.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Financing disaster response expenses for eligible expenses already incurred during the post-disaster response period.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Implementation support for the incremental operating costs of the project, including as well the creation of small, temporary field implementation offices, train-&#13;
     ing, exposure visits, and knowledge exchange programs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Contingency emergency response, which can be triggered, at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural&#13;
     disaster to re-allocate unallocated project funds to support response and reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    2,500 affected households with resilient housing, restoration of 20 public buildings, 3,600 km of roads, 140 bridle bridges, and 400 bridle roads.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    By the end of the project the Uttarakhand Disaster Management Authority will be informing disaster management preparedness and response measures in the&#13;
     state using a robust information system, based on updated disaster risk data.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     In 2003, only 50 percent of habitations in the mountain state of Uttarakhand were categorized as â&#128;&#156;fully coveredâ&#128;&#157; with functioning water supply schemes, 38 percent&#13;
     as â&#128;&#156;partially covered,â&#128;&#157; and about 12 percent as â&#128;&#156;not covered.â&#128;&#157; Between 75 to 80 percent of the rural population did not have access to latrines. Villagers spent one&#13;
     to three hours a day collecting water for domestic use. The problem was aggravated by water-supply systems with outdated design and inadequate operations and&#13;
     maintenance. All too often, rural water supply and sanitation services did not adequately respond to the user communitiesâ&#128;&#153; needs, and structures were built at sites&#13;
     without consideration of community needs or preferences. This resulted in government-dominated and target-driven service that became unsustainable in many&#13;
     communities.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to improve the effectiveness of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation services through decentralization, increasing the role of&#13;
     Panchayati Raj Institutions and local communities in the state of Uttarakhand, and by restoring services of damaged schemes in disaster affected areas. The project&#13;
     supports a sector-wide approach and has three components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    RWSS sector Development: Supports the stateâ&#128;&#153;s sector reform process by establishing and enhancing its institutional capacity to implement, manage, and sustain&#13;
          the medium term RWSS program, including sector planning, programming, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). Key elements include transfer of RWSS ser-&#13;
          vice delivery from the state water agencies to Panchayati Raj Institutions, and transformation of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role from service provider to facilitator.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    RWSS infrastructure investments: Aims to improve sustainable access to RWSS services by financing the infrastructure and software investments. All new water&#13;
          supply investments are made in an integrated manner, with catchment-area management, health, and hygiene awareness promotion, and incentives for con-&#13;
          struction of individual household latrines. The new investments include building or rehabilitating water supply and sanitation facilities, including water source-&#13;
          strengthening measures, which the communities plan, implement, and manage.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    RWSS program management support and M&amp;E.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    RWSS Disaster Mitigation Activities.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The RWSS sector-wide approach with uniform policies and principles has been successfully implemented across all 13 districts in the state.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The three implementing agencies have completed water supply works for Single Village Schemes and Multi Village Schemes in 7,208 habitations, against the&#13;
          overall target of 8,270 habitations.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project is expected to cover 8,490 habitations, exceeding the project target of 8,270 habitations.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The project has already benefited 1.22 million people, against a target of 1.2 million.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    An additional 721,358 Individual Household Latrines have been constructed, and national-level Nirmal Gram Puruskar awards received by 525 GPs (accounting&#13;
          for 32 percent of the Project Gram Panchayats, against an overall project target of 30 percent).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The Government of Uttarakhand has honored the project management unit with the Right to Information Award in October 2009 and October 2010 for its good&#13;
          governance and transparency practices.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    More than 3.8 million additional people have access to improved sanitation facilities and 6,670, already above the end-project target of 6,000, have access to&#13;
          piped household water connections that are benefiting from rehabilitation works undertaken by the project.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Recurrent and severe electricity shortages (peak power deficit of 9 percent and energy deficit of 8.7 percent in 2013) have imposed high costs on the Indian economy.&#13;
In addition, the poor technical and commercial performance of most of the state electricity providers has led to a loss of $20 billion during 2011-12, according to&#13;
the India Power Sector Review Study (2013). This bleak scenario is compounded by the fact that more than 350 million people in India today still lack access to&#13;
electricity, impeding their ability to fully benefit from fast-growing economy. Furthermore, Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s power sector also relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily coal), and&#13;
the country is currently the worldâ&#128;&#153;s fourth largest GHG emitter. To address these issues, the Government of India plans to: (i) expand generation by using renewable&#13;
energy sources whenever feasible and strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate energy exchange across regions; (ii) improve energy efficiency and&#13;
performance of institutions in the power sector; and (iii) expand access for rural and peri-urban populations. The Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydroelectric Power Project&#13;
(VPHEP) is an important part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#152;s commitment to helping improve the performance and sustainability of the hydropower sector in India, which is&#13;
critical to the greening of the power sector, and sustaining the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth. In line with the Ministry of Powerâ&#128;&#153;s desire to develop public-sector hydro&#13;
companies into top-performing public companies in the power sector, like POWERGRID and NTPC Limited, the Bank is supporting THDC India Limited (THDCIL) to&#13;
strengthen its capacity and systems to become a leading hydropower company. The project, which supports activities on the Alaknanda River in Uttarakhand and the&#13;
Rampur Hydroelectric Project on the Sutlej River in neighboring Himachal Pradesh, provides an opportunity to inform the hydro policy dialogue and practice in these&#13;
two Himalayan states that are expected play a critical role in Indiaâ&#128;&#152;s hydropower development in the future. Building on lessons learned in other countries, the project&#13;
will help create effective project execution for cascaded hydropower systems and foster a coordinated approach to river basin planning and development. VPHEP will&#13;
also help increase generating capacity to complement the government of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to improve the performance of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s distribution and transmission&#13;
networks.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to increase the supply of electricity to Indiaâ&#128;&#152;s national grid through the addition of renewable, low-carbon energy, and to&#13;
strengthen THDCILâ&#128;&#153;s institutional capacity with respect to the preparation and implementation of economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable hydropower&#13;
projects. It has two components:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Construction of the 444 MW VPHEP in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Support to capacity building and institutional strengthening at THDC India Limited, the project developer.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Addition of 444 MW of renewable energy (hydropower) generation capacity.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    The strengthening of the institutional capacity of THDCIL through the development and implementation of a capacity building and institutional strengthening&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
 India is a fast growing economy with a rising demand for skilled workers. A skilled workforce enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the labor market, reduces skills&#13;
 bottlenecks, and enhances mobility and productivity. One of the key suppliers of such workers is the vocational education and training (VET) system. A major component of&#13;
 the VET system is the Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS), run under the auspices of the Ministry of Labor and Employment and the National Council for Vocational Training&#13;
 (NCVT) at the national level, and the state departments dealing with vocational training and the State Council for Vocational Training at the state level. However, graduates&#13;
 from the CTS system face low labor market outcomes; the 2006 Baseline Tracer Study conducted by the World Bank shows that less than 30 percent of graduates from&#13;
 industrial training institutes find employment upon graduation. The Indian government sought World Bank assistance to introduce key reforms at the system and institution&#13;
 levels.&#13;
 The project development objective is to improve the employment outcomes of graduates from the vocational training system, by making the design and delivery of training&#13;
 more demand responsive. It has three components:&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Improving quality of vocational training focuses on: (i) improving quality and relevance of training provided in 400 eligible Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) selected&#13;
      competitively from eligible states/union territories; (ii) upgrading training of ITI instructors; and (iii) providing incentive funds to states to reward good performance in&#13;
      project implementation.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Promoting systemic reforms and innovations focuses on activities that enhance the overall reach and effectiveness of the vocational training system in the medium-&#13;
      term. Implementation of activities under this component is the responsibility of the Directorate General of Employment and Training, discharged in collaboration with&#13;
      states, industry associations, and private training providers, as necessary.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;  Project management, monitoring and evaluation support is provided to: (i) establish project management and implementation structures at the national and state&#13;
      levels; (ii) make improvements in system management and implementation of reforms by training policy planners, managers, and administrators; (iii) carry out project&#13;
      monitoring and dissemination of information with the help of a computer-based management information system; and (iv) carry out project evaluation and policy and&#13;
      system research studies at the national and state levels.&#13;
 KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
 The project has performed well, surpassing many of its end-of-project targets. A new sector-focused multi-skilling, multi- entry and exit vocational training course called&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;Center of Excellenceâ&#128;&#157; was introduced in the CTS system. The Institution Management Committee (IMC), with significant private-sector representation, was set up at training&#13;
 institution level to bring strong private-sector participation in institutional management, and significant power and functions were devolved to the IMC. At the national and&#13;
 state levels, private-sector participation in decision-making bodies was introduced. A strong monitoring and evaluation culture was created by establishing a sector-wide and&#13;
 web-based management information system. Capacity was significantly strengthened for developing curricula, training trainers, and developing training and teaching aids.&#13;
 This had an impact on recruitment and professional development policies related to trainers.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;     78 percent** of the graduates from project ITIs already exit from the CTS system with a NCVT certificate, compared to the baseline of 61 percent and an end-of-project&#13;
       target of 73 percent.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;     60 percent of project ITI graduates find employment within one year of finishing training, compared to the baseline 32 percent and an end-of-project target of 50&#13;
       percent. 38 percent of female graduates find employment within a year of finishing training compared to the baseline of 18.7 percent.&#13;
 â&#150; â&#150;     Real monthly earnings of employed graduates from project ITI, measured one year after completing training, rose from a baseline of Rs2,421 to Rs3550# (as of October&#13;
       2012).&#13;
 **Data refer to the batch of trainees enrolled in 2010-11. These trainees would have taken their final institution-based examination in 2012. # Data from mid-term tracer study.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Water resources development is a priority for the Government of India, given the countryâ&#128;&#153;s limited water resources. Development of irrigation infrastructure is necessary&#13;
to reduce climatic risks, and irrigated agricultural development has always been central to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategy for ensuring food security for all. The average&#13;
agriculture productivity levels are still low in West Bengal, compared to those of advanced agricultural states in the country. There is large potential for enhancing&#13;
agriculture productivity, provided that the timely supply of all inputs and adequate irrigation water can be assured. Despite having abundant surface and groundwater&#13;
resources, 40 percent of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s cultivated area is rain-fed, and the cropping intensity has stagnated at 180 percent over the last decade. The majority of the rain-fed&#13;
area belongs to small and marginal farmers, and to help improve livelihoods, the state provides them with minor irrigation schemes for exploiting surface and ground&#13;
water, including lift irrigation, deep and shallow tube wells, pump-dug wells, tanks, and small water harvesting structures. Once developed and implemented, these&#13;
schemes are operated and maintained by the community. Unfortunately, performance of these minor irrigation schemes has been mixed, mainly due to the absence&#13;
of any strong ownership among users. The Bank-supported West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project aims to contribute to improved reliability&#13;
of water resources for irrigation and increased agricultural productivity by empowering communities. The total area to be developed under the project is 139,000&#13;
hectares, benefiting an estimated 166,000 farm families.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to enhance agricultural production of small and marginal farmers by developing minor irrigation schemes, strengthening&#13;
community-based irrigation management, and supporting agricultural development, including provision of agricultural services, encouraging crop diversification and&#13;
use of new technologies, and creating income-generating opportunities. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s four components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthening community-based institutions by establishing water usersâ&#128;&#153; associations (WUA) and other farmersâ&#128;&#153; organizations to assume responsibilities for&#13;
     management, operation, and maintenance of minor irrigation schemes and improved irrigated agricultural practices.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Irrigation system development by supporting construction of 2,400 new minor surface water irrigation schemes and 2,260 new minor ground water irrigation&#13;
     schemes.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Agriculture support services by providing agricultural support services in the project area to enhance productivity and diversification in agriculture.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Project management support by strengthening the stateâ&#128;&#153;s water resources department to ensure effective project management.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
The project, in its third year of implementation, is in the process of providing irrigation schemes for around 12,000 ha and 29,000 beneficiaries. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;
contribution will be in the area of modernized planning and monitoring, improved water resources development and management practices, and creation of&#13;
sustainable institutions to efficiently operate and maintain irrigation structures. The project is expected to result in a more than 40 percent increase in yield of main&#13;
agricultural crops (rice, oilseeds, and vegetables), 4,200 new operational WUAs with 25 percent female beneficiaries, and more than 60 percent of marginal and poor&#13;
farmers strengthened to generate resources for management, operation, and maintenance of the schemes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     West Bengal has a progressive record among Indian states in decentralization initiatives for local governance systems. The Panchayats and Rural Development&#13;
     Department (PRDD) of the government of West Bengal is committed to expanding and deepening this process by providing the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)&#13;
     with the resources, capacities, and incentives to improve service delivery and governance. The overall strategic vision of the project is to institute a discretionary block&#13;
     grant system which incentivizes local governance and service delivery performance throughout the state as an integral and ongoing element of the broader PRI fiscal&#13;
     framework in West Bengal.&#13;
&#13;
     The project development objective is to develop institutionally strengthened local government bodies at the village levelsâ&#128;&#148; - Gram Panchayats (GP. The project features&#13;
     four main components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Support annual performance-based block grants to participating GPs for local public goods and services. In order to access the grant, GPs are required to meet a&#13;
          prescribed set of mandatory minimum conditions and pass an annual independent score-based performance assessment in key areas.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Focus on capacity building for GPs by providing support to strengthen the institutional capacity of GPs to deliver basic services.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Strengthen PRDDâ&#128;&#153;s oversight and systems for monitoring of PRIs through: (i) annual performance assessments and quality assurance audits; (ii) internal and&#13;
          external monitoring and reporting systems; (iii) evaluations and studies of the program; and (iv) external audit support.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Support program management and project communications in overall project coordination, implementation, and citizen communication.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    96 percent of the GPs have already established well-functioning planning and fiduciary systems, compared to target of 80 percent.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    In FY2014-2015, 960 of 1,000 GPs have qualified for the fourth round of the block grant. This is a 48 percent increase since the project started.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    At present, 98.6 percent of the project GPs have approved and disclosed their plans and budgets; 99 percent have â&#128;&#156;cleanâ&#128;&#157; external audits; 100 percent have up-&#13;
          to-date financial, planning, and accounting records maintained in the GP Management System; and around 97 percent could expend a minimum 60 percent of&#13;
          all untied grants received by the third quarter in a fiscal year.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Own Source Revenue generation by project GPs has increased by 65 percent in FY2013-2014 over the base year of FY2010-2011.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    The annual performance assessment shows that districts with a large vulnerable group population are progressively ranking better.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    Close to 83 percent GPs have incorporated vulnerable group plans into the FY2013-2014 GP annual plan.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    All project GPs undertake gender-based reporting on schemes.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;    All project GPs provide detailed implementation reports through web-based management information system.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
Improving water availability through watershed treatment is crucial to increase agriculture productivity and improve livelihoods in the rain-fed areas of Uttarakhand&#13;
state. Of Uttarakhandâ&#128;&#153;s 8.5 million people, 37 percent live below the poverty line, compared to the national average of 30 percent. More than 90 percent of the stateâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
53,500 km2 are hilly with rugged topography, and about 80 percent of the population living in the hills depends on agriculture. However, just under 10 percent of&#13;
land in the valleys and surrounded by hills is cropped; of this, 81 percent is rain-fed. . On average, the crop yields in the hills are 50 percent lower than those found in&#13;
the plains, due mainly to limited availability of irrigation water, poor in-situ rainwater conservation, and loss of fertile topsoil. These are major constraints to enhancing&#13;
rain-fed agronomic practices and increasing agricultural productivity.&#13;
&#13;
The Gramya I project (2004-2012) supported the Government of Uttarakhand in improving agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods in the hill areas by enhancing&#13;
natural resource management and strengthening the administrative capacity of the targeted Gram Panchayats (GPs), or village councils. Gramya I treated 234,000&#13;
ha in 76 microwatersheds and built the administrative capacity of 468 GPs, benefiting some 285,000 people. With strong community participation and adoption of&#13;
improved water conservation techniques, the Gramya I intervention areas showed a 68 percent increase in water discharge rates.&#13;
The development objective of Gramya II is to increase the efficiency of natural resource use and productivity of rain-fed agriculture by participating communities in&#13;
selected microwatersheds of Uttarakhand. The project is expected to benefit about 55,600 households and targets 509 GPs. Its four components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Social mobilization and participatory watershed planning: Mobilize GPs to identify interventions to increase effective land use and water resource management&#13;
     and develop agriculture and income-generation activities.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Watershed treatment and rain-fed area development: Finance GP-level watershed development plans, including check dams, water-harvesting structures, reha-&#13;
     bilitated soil conservation structures, improved seeds and innovative agronomic technologies.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Enhancing livelihood opportunities: Facilitate agribusiness development, entrepreneurial activities for vulnerable groups and strengthen the business planning&#13;
     and management capacity of farmer groups.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    Knowledge management and project coordination: Strengthen the institutional capacity and knowledge management.&#13;
&#13;
KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    25 percent increase in water discharge.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    20 percent increase in biomass.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    7,800 additional hectares in rain-fed areas under irrigation.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    50 percent increase in productivity of selected irrigated crops.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;    20 percent increase in productivity of selected rain-fed crops.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            India’s progress in economic and human
            development is one of the most significant global
            achievements of recent times. Between 2005 and 2010, India’s
            share of global gross domestic product (GDP) increased from
            1.8 to 2.7 percent. India is home to globally recognized
            companies in pharmaceuticals, steel, and space technologies,
            and the country is a leader in the use of information
            technologies for e-government and public service delivery.
            In line with these transformations, India is now among the
            top 10 percentile of fast growing nations and has become a
            prominent global voice. While India has made significant
            progress in reducing absolute poverty, it is still home to
            270 million poor people. Helping India address these
            challenges is central to the World Bank Group’s goal of
            reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
