The Little Green Data Book 2014 is based on World Development Indicators&#13;
2014 and its online database. Defining, gathering, and disseminating&#13;
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations.&#13;
The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of&#13;
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer&#13;
censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties&#13;
of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the&#13;
nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to the international&#13;
statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations have also made important&#13;
contributions. We are indebted to the World Development Indicators partners,&#13;
as detailed in World Development Indicators 2014.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book 2014 is the result of close collaboration between&#13;
the staff of the Development Data Group of the Development Economics&#13;
Vice Presidency and the Agriculture and Environmental Services Department&#13;
of the Sustainable Development Vice Presidency. Liu Cui, Mahyar Eshragh-&#13;
Tabary, Sonu Jain, Esther Naikal, Urvashi Narain, Ulf Narloch, William Prince,&#13;
and Jomo Tariku contributed to its preparation. Azita Amjadi coordinated&#13;
the production of the book. Barton Matheson Willse &amp; Worthington typeset&#13;
the book. The work was carried out under the direction of Haishan Fu and&#13;
Juergen Voegele. Staff from The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Publishing and Knowledge&#13;

The goals of the World Bank Group are to eradicate poverty and promote&#13;
shared prosperity in a manner that ensures environmental, social, and&#13;
economic sustainability. In a world of finite planetary boundaries and natural&#13;
resources it is important that any progress made toward these twin goals&#13;
can be sustained.&#13;
&#13;
To operationalize the twin goals, two indicatorsâ&#128;&#148;the number of people in&#13;
extreme poverty and the income growth of the bottom 40 percentâ&#128;&#148;were&#13;
introduced with the adoption of the goals in April 2013. Yet measuring progress&#13;
toward these goals requires a better understanding of the sustainability&#13;
dimensions of progress, with measurable indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Meaningful sustainability indicators are also important for the formulation&#13;
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The importance of putting&#13;
sustainable development at the core of the post-2015 development framework&#13;
has been recognized. Yet this will require measurable targets.&#13;
&#13;
Capturing a concept through a few summary indicators is difficult for all&#13;
fields, but it is doubly complex for sustainability, with its multiple facets,&#13;
global and local dimensions, long time horizon, and limited data availability.&#13;
&#13;
Accumulation of wealth is at the heart of the issue of determining whether&#13;
development in a country is sustainable. It is wealthâ&#128;&#148;broadly defined to&#13;
include produced capital, natural capital (including forests), and human&#13;
and social capitalâ&#128;&#148;that underlies the generation of national income. Gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP) has conventionally been used to assess economic&#13;
performance, measuring economic growth from one year to the next. But&#13;
GDP does not take into account depreciation and depletion of wealth, and&#13;
therefore does not provide an indication of whether growth is sustainable.&#13;
An economy could appear to be growing in the near term by running down&#13;
assets. Assessments of economic performance therefore need to be based&#13;
on both measures of annual growth (such as GDP) and measures of the&#13;
comprehensive wealth of a country, which indicate whether that growth is&#13;
sustainable in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
Touching upon this idea, the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s corporate scorecard, result&#13;
measurement frameworks, and country diagnostics will apply change in wealth&#13;
per capita as a new sustainability indicator. It is a modified version of the&#13;
genuine savings or adjusted net savings indicator that measures changes in&#13;
produced, human, and natural capital, and accounts for the wealth-diluting&#13;
effects of population growth (Box 1). A country with continuously negative&#13;
changes in wealth per capita is depleting its wealth and can be said to be&#13;
on an unsustainable development path.&#13;
&#13;
This metric allows policy makers to identify some of the threats to the&#13;
sustainability of economic growth and policy solutions to strengthen&#13;
comprehensive wealth accumulation. Yet we will need complementary&#13;
indicators to understand all the dimensions of sustainability. The Little&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 Change in wealth per capita offers a comprehensive framework to look&#13;
 at sustainability threats to the twin goals. It is derived from standard&#13;
 national accounting measures of gross national savings by making four&#13;
 types of adjustments (Figure 1):&#13;
&#13;
 (1) Deduction for depreciation of produced capital, measured by capital&#13;
     consumption of produced assets;&#13;
 (2) Addition from human capital formation, measured by current expen-&#13;
     ditures on education;&#13;
 (3) Deduction for depletion of natural capital, including minerals, energy,&#13;
     and forest resources; and&#13;
 (4) Deduction for wealth-diluting effects of population growth, based on&#13;
     the additional savings needed to keep current tangible wealth per&#13;
     capita constant with a changing population.&#13;
&#13;
 As the case of Sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 illustrates, aggregated gross&#13;
 savings and formation of human capital are not sufficient to compensate&#13;
 for depreciation of produced capital, depletion of natural capital, and&#13;
 population growth. The result: the region is wealth depleting (Figure 1).&#13;

&#13;
 Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the poorest record&#13;
 on sustainability. 88 percent of its countries were found to be deplet-&#13;
 ing their wealth in 2010 (Table 1). The share of countries with wealth&#13;
 depletionâ&#128;&#148;globally at about 45 percentâ&#128;&#148;decreases as income levels&#13;
 increase (Table 1), indicating that poorer countries face severe sustain-&#13;
 ability challenges.&#13;
&#13;
 In many resource-rich countries, reinvesting natural resource rents in&#13;
 other forms of productive capital is one important way of avoiding wealth&#13;
 depletion.&#13;

&amp;#12;                  Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Each&#13;
economy in The Little Data Book is classified as low income, middle income,&#13;
or high income. Low- and middle-income economies are sometimes referred&#13;
to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it is not&#13;
intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar&#13;
development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final&#13;
stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect&#13;
development status. Note: Classifications are fixed during the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
fiscal year (ending on June 30), thus countries remain in the categories in&#13;
which they are classified irrespective of any revisions to their per capita&#13;
income data.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,035 or less&#13;
in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$1,035 but less than $12,616. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-&#13;
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $4,085.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,616 or more.&#13;

Organization of the United Nations as land under temporary crops (double-&#13;
cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for&#13;
pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow.&#13;
Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under&#13;
permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long&#13;
periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa,&#13;
coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit&#13;

wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed&#13;
grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain&#13;
only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or&#13;
silage and those used for grazing are excluded. The FAO allocates production&#13;
data to the calendar year in which the bulk of the harvest took place. Most&#13;
of a crop harvested near the end of a year will be used in the following year.&#13;
(Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2012)&#13;
&#13;
Change in wealth per capita is a measure of sustainability that indicates&#13;
whether enough assets are saved to sustain the same welfare per capita&#13;
in the future. It is based on gross national savings adjusted for changes in&#13;
physical, human, and natural capital and accounting for additional resource&#13;
needs due to population growth. (World Bank estimates; data are for 2010)&#13;
&#13;

Freshwater withdrawal, total, is total water withdrawal, excluding evaporation&#13;
losses from storage basins and including water from desalination plants&#13;
in countries where they are a significant source. Withdrawals can exceed&#13;
100 percent of internal renewable resources because river flows from other&#13;
countries are not included, because extraction from nonrenewable aquifers&#13;
or desalination plants is considerable, or because there is significant water&#13;
reuse. (Food and Agriculture Organization and World Resources Institute;&#13;
data are for various years; for details see World Development Indicators&#13;
2014, Primary data documentation)&#13;
&#13;
