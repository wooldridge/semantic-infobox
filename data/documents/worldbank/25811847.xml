&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Global value chains (GVCs) may represent a significant opportunity for the Southern African Customs Union&#13;
(SACU) to improve the regionâ&#128;&#153;s prospects for expanding noncommodity exports. Such an expansion would&#13;
support growth, diversification, and, ultimately, job creation. In the past, for a country to become an&#13;
apparel exporter, for example, they would need everything from design capabilities through to textile mills;&#13;
similarly, to export in the automotive sector a country would need to produce engines and all&#13;
subcomponents on a scale to support assembly. Under GVC dynamics, a country can specialize in certain&#13;
activities (such as sewing, specific components, or subassemblies) and import the necessary inputs. While&#13;
such a situation does not guarantee significant value capture and upgrading by developing economies, it&#13;
does provide a vital first step on the ladder. Nowhere has this been more evident than in China, and more&#13;
widely across East Asia. In these regions, GVCs are at the heart of the open-economy model that was&#13;
responsible for the growth and poverty reduction success story of the region in recent decades.&#13;
&#13;
With wages rising rapidly in China, parts of these GVCs are migrating elsewhere in the region and globally.&#13;
Some estimates suggest that 85 million manufacturing jobs will migrate from coastal China over the next&#13;
20 years (Lin 2011), and Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be a major beneficiary. The SACU regionâ&#128;&#148;with&#13;
its abundance of natural capital and surplus labor, along with relatively good infrastructure and a quality&#13;
institutional environmentâ&#128;&#148;should be in a good position to attract investment for GVCs. Beyond assembly&#13;
manufacturing that is typical of GVCs (such as apparel, electronics, and automotive), the region should also&#13;
be extremely well-placed to compete as a location for value addition to natural resources (mining and&#13;
agriculture). Both types of investment would not only drive exports and have the potential to create&#13;
significant employment, but would also support productivity growth by bringing global technologies and&#13;
knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
At the moment, however, the SACU region remains at the margins of most production networks. South&#13;
Africa has a strong position in the European-centered automotive value chain, and Lesotho and Swaziland&#13;
feed into the U.S.-based apparel value chains. But for the most part, the SACU region, like the rest of Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, has yet to become established as a significant node in GVCs. One reason for this may be&#13;
the regional nature of most networks. Mexico and Central America have become the sourcing hubs for&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Factory North Americaâ&#128;&#153;, Central &amp; Eastern Europe and to a lesser degree North Africa for â&#128;&#152;Factory Europeâ&#128;&#153;,&#13;
and parts of Southeast Asia for â&#128;&#152;Factory Japanâ&#128;&#153; and increasingly â&#128;&#152;Factory Chinaâ&#128;&#153;. It is unclear how big a&#13;
handicap Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;s geographical distance from major markets may be for integrating into GVCs. In&#13;
practice, it is likely to be a significant barrier in some value chains, but much less so for others. Moreover,&#13;
production networks serving European or U.S. markets need not be the only focus. With growing markets&#13;
in the region, a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; might increasingly be sustainable in the regional context.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as the region looks to GVCs, it must consider both joining GVCs and the more difficult challenge of&#13;
upgrading in themâ&#128;&#148;in terms of moving to higher value-added activities, and generating productivity&#13;
spillovers and higher-quality jobs. The task-based nature of GVCs creates opportunities for developing&#13;
countries to establish very quickly a position in global trade within a sector in which they may have had no&#13;
previous experience. Such a position brings with it exports and jobs, but does not guarantee their quality&#13;
or sustainability. Lesotho is a good example. In many respects, its entry into the global apparel value chain&#13;
has been a huge success. However, almost 30 years after receiving its first investments in the sector,&#13;
Lesotho still has no locally owned exporters or even subcontractors and no local firms providing any&#13;
strategic goods and services inputs to the sector. The failure of Lesotho to upgrade its position in the sector&#13;
forces it to rely on wage restraint, trade preferences, and fiscal incentives to maintain its tenuous position.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             iv&#13;
&amp;#12;For SACU countries, and for South Africa in particular, joining GVCs is not enough; they must establish&#13;
value-adding positions in these production networks, and upgrade continuously if they are to use GVCs&#13;
effectively as an instrument for inclusive growth&#13;
&#13;
In this context, the summary reportâ&#128;&#148;which draws on the results of 12 background papers â&#128;&#148;aims to&#13;
establish greater clarity about the potential of GVCs to act as an engine for growth in the SACU region, as&#13;
well as the requirements to turn potential into reality. Finally, this summary report assesses the&#13;
implications of GVC integration for trade, investment, growth, jobs, and productivity.&#13;
&#13;
SACU in global and regional value chains&#13;
There is great heterogeneity among countries and across sectors in terms of the scale and nature of GVC&#13;
integration. Lesotho has made the largest strides in terms of GVC participation (through the apparel sector)&#13;
as can be seen in rapidly growing gross exports and domestic value added (DVA), together with a declining&#13;
ratio of DVA to gross exports. Botswana and Swaziland fare poorly, as evidenced by stagnant and declining&#13;
DVA performance. South Africa and Namibia, meanwhile, show moderate levels of GVC participation. From&#13;
a sectoral perspective, servicesâ&#128;&#148;particularly transport, hotels, and restaurantsâ&#128;&#148;have grown more rapidly&#13;
than manufacturing in most countries. South Africa has very limited backward links in GVCs; in most sectors&#13;
(with the notable exception of automotive) its use of foreign inputs in exports is less than half, often closer&#13;
to one-third, of the global average. On the other hand, South Africa (along with Namibia and Swaziland)&#13;
make use of relatively high-technology imported inputs within GVCs. All countries are positioned relatively&#13;
weakly in value chains, either far upstream (commodity sales) or far downstream (end-market sales with&#13;
limited value added, such as Lesotho in apparel).&#13;
&#13;
Regional value chains (RVCs) remain significantly underdeveloped. Apparel represents the one exception,&#13;
where regional trade has developed significantly in recent years. That said, the apparel trade in SACU is a&#13;
short value chain. It consists of cut-make-trim (CMT) operations using mainly inputs imported from outside&#13;
the region to sell into South Africa. Incipient value chains may be developing in the automotive sector, with&#13;
South African firms outsourcing some labor-intensive activities into Botswana and Lesotho. But this is likely&#13;
to remain niche. In the agribusiness sector, where the opportunities for RVC development should perhaps&#13;
be greatest, RVCs are limited. This is partly a function of huge asymmetries in scale between South Africa&#13;
and the rest of the region, but also by significant trade barriers, including infant industry protection, quotas&#13;
and bans, licensing requirements, and lack of harmonization in standards and labeling. Significant&#13;
opportunities exist to deepen integration in agribusiness value chains, as well as value chains in tourism&#13;
and other services.&#13;
&#13;
How realistic is it for SACU countries to replicate the â&#128;&#152;Factory Asiaâ&#128;&#153; model in Southern Africa? The findings&#13;
in Chapter 4 are positive in this respect. In assessing the factors that appear to matter most for&#13;
competitiveness in the production of GVC intermediatesâ&#128;&#148;logistics capabilities, strong institutions, human&#13;
capital, financial capital, and proximity to marketsâ&#128;&#148;South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s basket of capabilities compares&#13;
reasonably well to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. And critically, South Africa&#13;
and BLNS countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland) show strong complementarities in their&#13;
capability mix. Such complementarity suggests that a â&#128;&#152;hub and spokeâ&#128;&#153; model of RVCs linking (through South&#13;
Africa) to GVCs might well be appropriate in the region.&#13;
&#13;
The policy environment for value chain competitiveness in SACU&#13;
Among the biggest constraints facing the region are structural onesâ&#128;&#148;particularly scale and distance from&#13;
markets. Moreover, population in the region is more than 30 times smaller than in East Asia. Thus, with a&#13;
limited labor pool and small regional markets, production tends to operate at low volumes, making it&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              v&#13;
&amp;#12;difficult for firms and sectors to leverage scale economies for productivity gains. Low-volume production&#13;
tends to keep the manufacturing sectorâ&#128;&#148;which is at the heart of the flying geese pattern of economic&#13;
growthâ&#128;&#148;relatively undeveloped and uncompetitive in a global context. In addition, large distances to&#13;
global markets mean that while the region may be able to compete in standardized, lower-value tasks, it&#13;
will have difficultly upgrading into tasks that require globally leading knowledge, coordination, and&#13;
knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
The regionâ&#128;&#153;s trade policy and trade facilitation environments, while not necessarily binding constraints to&#13;
participation in GVCs, significantly reduce the potential for the development of competitive RVCs. Tariff&#13;
and especially nontariff barriers remain significant restrictions, hampering interaction between the&#13;
gateway and its periphery. The biggest barriers occur between the SACU region and Southern Africa. For&#13;
example, while Botswana and Namibia possess one-stop border posts that take 20 minutes for lorries,&#13;
transport from Windhoek to Lubango in southern Angola can take up to 15 days. While border delays are&#13;
improving, nontariff barriers are a significant concern, with quality, sanitary and phytosanitary standards&#13;
(SPS), and other standards often applied unsystematically.&#13;
&#13;
The BLNS countries in SACU regularly invoke the 2002 agreementâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;infant industryâ&#128;&#153; clause to erect internal&#13;
trade barriers to imports from other SACU states (but principally South Africa) and impose a wide variety&#13;
of import bans on agricultural and agro-processed goods from South Africa. For its part, South African&#13;
customs officials reportedly regularly interdict goods moving across BLNS countriesâ&#128;&#153; borders into South&#13;
Africa. While large multinationals tend to find ways around many of these barriers (or absorb their costs),&#13;
they hit smaller firms, which are key to RVC development, particularly hard. Efforts to expand trade&#13;
agreements more widely in the region (for example, through the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement [TFTA])&#13;
may be critical for supporting a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; strategy. But thus far, efforts lack the ambition&#13;
and comprehensiveness required to make a significant difference in competitiveness. In particularly,&#13;
critical factors like rules of origin that facilitate RVCs and GVCs, agreements on services trade and&#13;
movement of natural persons, intellectual property rights, and corresponding investment agreements are&#13;
still lacking.&#13;
&#13;
GVC implications for productivity and jobs&#13;
Far more important than the static gains of exports from GVCs are the long-term productivity gains that&#13;
countries achieve through exposure to globally leading technologies and business practices. These&#13;
productivity gains should have wider implications for upgrading with specific value chains, but also should&#13;
spill over and impact growth and competitiveness across the economy. In addition, the gains from GVC&#13;
integration should, ideally, translate into more and better jobs.&#13;
&#13;
Among the most important theorized benefits from participation in GVCs are the opportunities they&#13;
present for raising the productivity of firms. Productivity spillovers from forward linkages in value chains&#13;
are expected to come from the requirements to meet demanding standards and technical regulations&#13;
imposed by buyers (and the technical support the buyers may offer to meet them), with subsequent&#13;
demands diffusing down through the domestic value chain. Productivity spillovers from backward linkages&#13;
arise from increasing access to the highest-quality inputs to production process. To test the productivity&#13;
impact of GVC participation in developing countries, we take a cross-section of more than 25,000 domestic&#13;
manufacturing firms in 78 low- and middle-income countries from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Enterprise Surveys&#13;
(2006â&#128;&#147;10) and estimate the impact of a domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s export share and share of imported inputs (as&#13;
proxies for GVC participation) on labor productivity. We test the results for the 78 countries overall and&#13;
then specifically for countries in the SACU regionâ&#128;&#148;Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. The results show&#13;
a clear, positive association between GVC integration and labor productivity in the overall sample and in&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          vi&#13;
&amp;#12;the SACU countries, where the spillover effects are highest in Namibia, slightly lower in South Africa, and&#13;
very low in Swaziland. This suggests that while all three countries are benefiting from productivity spillovers&#13;
from GVC participation, firms in Swaziland face significantly higher hurdles to turn their GVC integration&#13;
into productivity gains. Notably, in the rest of the country sample, the positive productivity gain is higher&#13;
on selling side (forward links) than on the buying side (backward links). But in all three SACU countries, the&#13;
productivity gains from being a buyer in GVCs are relatively higher (and in the case of Swaziland absolutely&#13;
higher). This implies that access to imported inputs, and the technology and knowledge embodied in them,&#13;
matters more to productivity of SACU-based firms than does exporting to within the region.&#13;
&#13;
Given the challenges SACU countries are facing in terms of joblessness and inequality, the relative&#13;
attractiveness of GVCs will depend a lot on the number and type of jobs that they bring. We use the newly&#13;
developed World Bank dataset on the labor content of exports (LACEX) and jobs content of exports (JOCEX)&#13;
to explore the possible implications of GVCs for jobs and wages in South Africa. We focus on the&#13;
automotive sector, where South Africa became deeply integrated over the past decade. We find that while&#13;
the rapid growth of exports meant that nominal jobs in the sector increased substantially over the decade,&#13;
the relative labor intensity of South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports declined sharply. In 2001, automotive exports&#13;
contributed around US$37 of labor per US$100 of exports; in 2011, this declined to below US$30. Despite&#13;
this decline, significant growth in jobs occurred as a result of the automotive sectorâ&#128;&#153;s extensive backward&#13;
links to the domestic economy. While each direct job in the automotive sector was linked with one indirect&#13;
job in 2001, by 2013 it was linked with three indirect jobs. Most importantly, the indirect job growth came&#13;
through services sector links; in fact, GVC integration appears to be associated with far greater job creation&#13;
in services sectors than manufacturing. GVC integration also appears to have significant implications for&#13;
skills demands. For direct jobs in the automotive sector, the relative contribution of unskilled labor has&#13;
declined significantly over the decade, while that of skilled labor has remained steady.&#13;
&#13;
A proposed way forwardâ&#128;&#148;the gateway model and policy recommendations&#13;
This report proposes a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; for SACU that is built around a â&#128;&#152;gateway modelâ&#128;&#153;. The&#13;
gateway model suggests that even if the immediate region is not always ideal for GVC-oriented production,&#13;
the region may still integrate with GVCs as the host of â&#128;&#152;command -controlâ&#128;&#153; and facilitating (services)&#13;
functions of global supply networks. Key components of a gateway are, therefore, transport infrastructure&#13;
and advanced producer services, such as banking and consultancy, which enable multinational&#13;
corporations (MNCs) to coordinate their networks. In this sense, the practical vision for a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153; hinges not around factories at all, but around services.&#13;
&#13;
SACU is well positioned as a gateway region for MNC â&#128;&#152;geeseâ&#128;&#153;. South Africa already operates as the trade&#13;
and transport gateway for the region, much like China did in the 1990s for East Asian economies. And the&#13;
development of Namibia as a logistics hub (leveraging Walvis Bay and the Trans-Kalahari and Trans-Caprivi&#13;
Corridors) bring still more depth and flexibility to the regionâ&#128;&#153;s offering. South Africa hosts global cities with&#13;
internationalized business environments, and has a growing services sector (including finance, business,&#13;
engineering, and design services); this can be complemented by the ongoing developments of Botswana&#13;
as a leading services and business hub in the region. Reinforcing these strengths can yield substantial&#13;
regional benefits. South Africa, in particular, can facilitate intensified foreign direct investment (FDI) and&#13;
associated investment flows throughout the region. Spillover effects from service support functions can&#13;
create opportunities for South Africa and BLNS countries to host headquarter, back office, and logistics&#13;
activities. BLNS countries could be well placed to leverage the gateway by plugging into GVCs in agriculture,&#13;
manufacturing, and services, and over time upgrading within them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              vii&#13;
&amp;#12;However, a number of challenges inhibit the potential of this gateway approach. Internationally, South&#13;
Africa struggles to attract MNC headquarters, with increasing competition from offshore locations (such&#13;
as Dubai and Mauritius). Geographically, it lacks trading centrality from a global perspective. Inefficient&#13;
borders increase transport costs and high tariff and nontariff barriers raise costs for GVC-oriented&#13;
producers. Domestically, South Africa (and indeed all of SACU) is limited by high wages, a lack of skilled&#13;
labor, and an insufficiently competitive knowledge infrastructure. And recent policies toward foreign&#13;
investors could inhibit the realization of GVC integration. Finally, South Africa lacks a comprehensive&#13;
â&#128;&#152;gateway strategyâ&#128;&#153;. Investment in, and access and pricing of, key trade infrastructure is highly geared&#13;
toward extractive exports at the expense of supporting a gateway strategy. In addition, state-owned&#13;
transport companies hold a dominant position in shaping both market competition and policy direction.&#13;
&#13;
The realization of value addition within the region depends on combining South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s globally&#13;
competitive and technologically sophisticated enterprises with foreign MNCs, supported by effective&#13;
regional integration. Below we outline a three-plank framework for supporting â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;:&#13;
&#13;
1. Facilitating regional economic densification&#13;
    As discussed throughout this report, the biggest challenges the region faces both in connecting to GVCs&#13;
    and in building RVCs are the structural ones of distance, scale, and asymmetry. Adopting an economic&#13;
    geography framework (World Bank 2008), policy makers across SACU should focus on facilitating&#13;
    economic density in the region by reducing distance and division. This will encourage industry&#13;
    concentration in the region and promote value chain integration. Such an approach is multi-scalar in&#13;
    natureâ&#128;&#148;it requires supportive actions at the urban, national, and regional scale. Key elements include:&#13;
    ï&#130;· improving trade and transport infrastructure and adopting an explicit gateway strategy&#13;
    ï&#130;· reducing barriers to cross-border trade, including trade policy harmonization of noncustoms&#13;
        border agency activities in SACU, and at SACU-SADC borders&#13;
    ï&#130;· promoting factor mobility by liberalizing work permits and movement of persons&#13;
    ï&#130;· promoting agglomeration through urban infrastructure and services, and promotion of clusters&#13;
        and special economic zones&#13;
2. Skills, services, and infrastructure for competitiveness&#13;
   A second plank of a program to support â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; focuses on the requirements for&#13;
   raising productivity of firms across the region. This was identified in the report as an important barrier&#13;
   holding back the potential of BLNS countries to leverage some of the comparative advantages they&#13;
   have for GVC-oriented production. It is also relevant for South Africa if it is to move toward higher&#13;
   valueâ&#128;&#147;added segments in value chains. Key elements include:&#13;
   ï&#130;· raising skills and closing gaps in technical and management skills&#13;
   ï&#130;· promoting factor mobility by liberalizing work permits and movement of persons and promoting&#13;
        deeper cross-border trade in services&#13;
   ï&#130;· improving the reliability of electricity and the quality/pricing of information and communications&#13;
        (ICT) infrastructure&#13;
3. Promoting open regionalism and institutional coordination&#13;
Finally, a third critical element to an effective gateway strategy involves policy and institutional&#13;
coordination at the regional level. Many policies that boost a gateway must be coordinated among all&#13;
regional states, and among national, provincial, and municipal governments. Economic activities&#13;
concentrate in a gateway and trigger growth impulses for the periphery. Yet, there is a time lag between&#13;
the concentration of economic activities in the gateway and economic development of the periphery.&#13;
Moreover, if lagging and leading places are brought together in value chains, those that take a subordinate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          viii&#13;
&amp;#12;role in the value chain will experience fewer benefits, initially, than those that take a superior role. This is&#13;
clearly a political challenge, in particular for the periphery that may benefit later and less than the gateway.&#13;
&#13;
At the moment the policy approach across SACU is anchored in a view of RVCs that is akin to import&#13;
substitution extended from the national terrain to the region. It would be to the regionâ&#128;&#153;s benefit to think&#13;
about how to link RVCs to GVCs, rather than how to replace MNC activities in the region. This requires a&#13;
facilitative approach, harnessing the gateway and actively promoting South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s lead role. In other&#13;
words, SACU countries should work cooperatively with both South African and foreign MNCs rather than&#13;
seeking to curtail their activities. Key elements include:&#13;
     ï&#130;· promoting gateway integration and open regionalism as a way forward for SACU countries&#13;
     ï&#130;· strengthening the focus and coordination of investment promotion&#13;
     ï&#130;· strengthening regional competition policy&#13;
     ï&#130;· supporting public-private dialogues for regional supply chains&#13;
&#13;
Beyond supporting gateway strategies, policies are also required to strengthen value chain positioning.&#13;
Value chain participation is not the end game. Being in a value chain today is no guarantee of being in one&#13;
tomorrow, nor of getting much value out of it. Successful positioning depends on establishing an&#13;
environment in which firms (domestic and foreign) become â&#128;&#152;territorializedâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;that is, they get location-&#13;
specific advantages that encourage them to invest for the long term. Success also depends on establishing&#13;
an environment where these firms are able to upgrade to higher value-added positioning in the chains.&#13;
This will ensure greater returns to workers and support the sustainability of value chains. Strengthening&#13;
value chain positioning can be achieved through policies and strategies that focus on two things: (i) helping&#13;
firms to upgrade in value chains; and (ii) â&#128;&#152;densificationâ&#128;&#153; of value chains, through broadening and deepening&#13;
local (and regional) supply relationships. The policies required to achieve these objectives are wide ranging&#13;
and include many of those already discussed above under the gateway strategy. Further policies include:&#13;
    ï&#130;· supporting multi-chain upgrading strategies&#13;
    ï&#130;· clustering for knowledge exchange, supply links, and skills&#13;
    ï&#130;· supporting the exploitation of regional economies of scale&#13;
    ï&#130;· investing in ICT to close the distance gap and promote coordination&#13;
    ï&#130;· active partnerships to support supply chain development&#13;
    ï&#130;· supporting outward FDI in value chains&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              ix&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Context and Objectives&#13;
&#13;
    1.1. Introduction&#13;
Once concentrated among a few large economies, global flows of goods, services, and capital now reach an&#13;
ever-larger number of countries worldwide. Global trade in goods and in services both increased 10 times&#13;
between 1980 and 2011, while foreign direct investment (FDI) flows increased almost 30-fold. The sales from&#13;
foreign-owned firms amount to US$26 trillion. One of the most significant reasons behind this transformation&#13;
in global trade and investment has been the rise of global value chains (GVCs), in which production processes&#13;
have been split up and discrete activities relocated around the world. More than 60 percent of global trade is&#13;
now estimated to be taking place in GVCs, employing an estimated 16 million people worldwide, with&#13;
developing countriesâ&#128;&#153; share in global value-added trade having grown to 42 percent from just 22 percent in&#13;
1990 (UNCTAD 2013).&#13;
&#13;
The benefits can be significant. UNCTADâ&#128;&#153;s (2013) World Investment Report notes that value-added trade&#13;
contributes on average nearly 30 percent to developing countriesâ&#128;&#153; gross domestic product (GDP); and&#13;
countries with the fastest-growing rates of GVC participation have GDP per capita growth rates 2 percent&#13;
above the average. GVC participation also exposes firms to new technologies and know-how that might&#13;
otherwise be unavailable, as well as to new sources of capital. It enables suppliers to meet product standards&#13;
and technical regulations that permit access to a greater variety of markets. At an economy-wide level, GVC&#13;
participation tends to lead to job creation, even if it depends significantly on imported content in exports.&#13;
&#13;
But there are also potential risks from GVC participation. The value added contribution of GVCs can be&#13;
relatively small in cases where the import content of exports is high and where GVC participation is limited to&#13;
low-skill, low-value parts of the chain. Value capture can also be low if value added is generated by affiliates&#13;
of multinationals that repatriate earnings and leave relatively little value added in domestic hands. Most&#13;
importantly, countries risk getting locked into low value-added segments, with subsequent implications for&#13;
potential wage growth. The integrated nature of GVC trade can also amplify shocks (Taglioni and Zavacka&#13;
2012), contributing to instability of output and employment in GVCs. Finally, the footloose nature of&#13;
international investment in some offshored activities commonly traded in GVCs can lead to a â&#128;&#156;race to the&#13;
bottomâ&#128;&#157; in terms of fiscal incentives as well as environmental, labor, and occupational standards.&#13;
&#13;
This short chapter presents a brief introduction to global and regional value chains (RVCs) and aims to provide&#13;
some perspective on what is different about trade and investment when considered from a GVC perspective.&#13;
Finally, it sets out the objectives and structure of the report.&#13;
&#13;
    1.2. Defining GVCs: outsourcing, offshoring, and governance&#13;
The term â&#128;&#152;value chainsâ&#128;&#153; essentially describes the various stages in which value is added to a product or s ervice&#13;
during the course of becoming the end product. A value chain is â&#128;&#152;globalâ&#128;&#153; when some of these stages are carried&#13;
out in more than one country, most notably when discrete tasks within a production process are fragmented&#13;
and dispersed across a number of countries. The fragmentation of production is nothing newâ&#128;&#148;firms have&#13;
always decided to focus on certain core processes within the â&#128;&#152;factory wallsâ&#128;&#153; and outsource others. What has&#13;
changed in recent decades is both the intensity of this fragmentation and its geographical dispersion. The&#13;
definition of what is core to a company is becoming increasingly narrow, with many and in some cases all&#13;
stages of physical production being outsourced. And while outsourcing in the past tended to remain&#13;
geographically proximate, the key trend of recent decades has been the offshoring of outsourced processes,&#13;
not just to over the border but around the world. This â&#128;&#156;second unbundlingâ&#128;&#157; of production (Baldwin 2012) was&#13;
made possible by a combination of the following factors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               1&#13;
&amp;#12;    1. Improved shipping technology, which reduced dramatically the costs and time for moving&#13;
       components around the world&#13;
    2. Global trade liberalization, which also reduced substantially the costs of moving parts and&#13;
       components across countries&#13;
    3. Global capital markets liberalization, which facilitated FDI flows from multinational corporations&#13;
       (MNCs)&#13;
    4. Revolutionary changes in information and communications technology (ICT), which reduced&#13;
       substantially the costs and challenges of coordinating and monitoring distant activities&#13;
&#13;
But while the term â&#128;&#152;global value chainâ&#128;&#153; is difficult to avoid in both research and policy circles, the definition of&#13;
what is exactly meant by a GVC differs significantly depending on the context. From a sectoral context, the&#13;
traditional description of a GVC tends to describe vertically segmented production networks, where different&#13;
tasks take place in different countries. This vertical specialization may result in networks of â&#128;&#156;spidersâ&#128;&#157; (where&#13;
components produced in various places come together somewhere for final assembly), â&#128;&#156;snakesâ&#128;&#157; (where each&#13;
linear stage of value addition takes place in a different location), or some combination of the two (Baldwin and&#13;
Venables 2013). Increasingly this traditional task-based description of GVCs has extended beyond&#13;
manufacturing to encompass services activities, including services GVCs (such as business process outsourcing&#13;
and other ITC-enabled services) as well as services tasks within manufacturing GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
A broader definition of the GVC concept encompasses value addition stages that turn raw commodities (such&#13;
as minerals or agricultural products) into final products. These so-called â&#128;&#152;additiveâ&#128;&#153; GVCs (Kaplinsky 2014) bring&#13;
the discussion on natural resources value addition, or beneficiation, into the GVC framework.&#13;
&#13;
From a functional context, the question of â&#128;&#156;how do you know a GVC when you see it?â&#128;&#157; returns both narrow&#13;
and much broader responses. Researchers coming at GVCs from the trade perspective tend to define GVCs&#13;
very broadly. To them, GVCs are about â&#128;&#156;importing to exportâ&#128;&#157; (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzales 2013), so any&#13;
intermediate inputs that are embodied in an product that is later exported are considered to be part of a GVC.&#13;
By contrast, researchers approaching GVCs from the development and sociological literature focus on the&#13;
issue of MNC â&#128;&#152;governanceâ&#128;&#153; in value chains.2 For them, evidence of clear influence of MNCs in governance of&#13;
the value chain is required.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there is the geographical context to consider. Most value chains are not in fact truly global but rather&#13;
regional in nature. Even in value chains that do span globally, most value is traded within regional confines,&#13;
because the economics of production and distribution, the lead time and flexibility requirements, and the&#13;
need for proximate interaction typically work against complete dispersion in the case of most tasks and value&#13;
chains. This means that while the GVC discourse tends to highlight globalization and multilateralism,&#13;
integrating at the regional level is perhaps even more critical. Thus, there is increasing emphasis on RVCs as a&#13;
complementary analytical category to GVCs. The essential value chain concept is the same, regardless of&#13;
whether the analytical focus is regional or global. Nonetheless, a distinction that could be drawn between the&#13;
two is that RVCs are primarily operated within a particular region, by regional actors, for regional markets. By&#13;
contrast GVCs are primarily operated by MNCs, transcend regional boundaries even though they may be&#13;
concentrated in particular regions, and are oriented toward extra-regional (global) markets. RVCs may be an&#13;
objective or reality in their own right, they may constitute a first step toward establishing or tying into GVCs,&#13;
or they complement an established GVC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12; Box 1.1: What types of GVCs does this report focus on?&#13;
 In light of the above discussion on the definition of GVCs, we summarize here the focus of this report:&#13;
&#13;
 Sectoral context: The main focus will be on vertically specialized value chains, although there will be some (limited)&#13;
 discussion of additive chains. Most of the emphasis is on industrial value chains, although services are also covered.&#13;
&#13;
 Functional context: Most of the analysis in this report defines value chains as activities involving import to export, as&#13;
 the approach to this work did not allow for detailed case study work to assess value chain governance patterns.&#13;
&#13;
 Geographical context: This report covers both GVCs and RVCs, with the â&#128;&#152;regionâ&#128;&#153; defined at SACU countries (Botswana,&#13;
 Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland).&#13;
&#13;
    1.3. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s different about GVC trade?&#13;
Three characteristics of GVC trade make it stand out from traditional trade in goods: (i) specialization of&#13;
production, (ii) interdependence among firms and countries, and (iii) the role (and power) of MNCs and the&#13;
concomitant integration of trade and investment.&#13;
&#13;
Specialization of production emerges in GVC networks, as individual firms and even individual countries focus&#13;
on discrete tasks or stages within the production process: rather than producing cars they produce&#13;
transmissions; rather than producing a t-shirt they produce just the fabric or simply do the sewing; rather than&#13;
farming and preparing prawns for the supermarket, they may simply de-shell them and send them on to&#13;
another country for end-market packaging. It is this specialization that allows firms and countries to participate&#13;
in value chains where they otherwise have no historical industry or comprehensive expertise. Nicaragua is a&#13;
major player in the U.S. automotive value chain, not because it has an automotive industry or expertise, but&#13;
because it has the combination of factors that enable it to specialize and compete in wire harness manufacture&#13;
(including proximity to markets, low wages, and skills derived from the adjacent apparel sector). Specialization&#13;
requires that countries become hyper-competitive in these specific tasks, driving demand for higher skills and&#13;
continuous improvements in quality and production costs. Competitiveness increasingly requires access to&#13;
more specialized, quality, and cost-effective services, including network services (telecommunications,&#13;
transport, energy), potentially finance, and professional services (legal, accounting, business services, logistics,&#13;
R&amp;D, and marketing). In many developing countries the domestic services infrastructure is in short supply,&#13;
finance is constrained, and human resource pools for domestic professional and technical services are small.&#13;
The other fundamental implication of specialization is interdependence across firms and countries.&#13;
&#13;
In a world of GVC production, firms and countries are highly interdependent, relying on each other as both&#13;
input and source markets. Thus, a traditional mercantilist approach to trade becomes counterproductive in a&#13;
GVC environment. Firms in a production chain require access to low-cost, high-quality inputs from all over the&#13;
world, enabling them to free up resources to concentrate on their core competencies (Cattaneo et al. 2013).&#13;
Slotting into global production networks means that speed, predictability, and flexibility are crucial. Thus,&#13;
supply chain efficiency has emerged as a particularly critical factor for GVC trade; nontariff barriers and other&#13;
border and behind-the-border policies and procedures that cause delays and raise costs undermine the&#13;
capacity to source imported inputs efficiently and hence adversely affect competitiveness in GVCs. The&#13;
importance of connectedness in GVCs goes beyond physical links and includes greater need for deep&#13;
knowledge of destination and source markets in terms of quality, cost, reliability, and standards, and lead&#13;
times.&#13;
&#13;
GVC trade also differs from traditional trade in the dominant role played by MNCs, in particular by cross-border&#13;
MNC investments and in the management by MNCs of the global production networks. Participation in GVCs&#13;
is often dependent on FDI, and so the investment policy environment plays a critical role. MNCs obviously&#13;
require a policy environment that facilitates rather than constrains FDI in flexible, import- and export-oriented&#13;
                                                                                                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;activities. They also require assurance that their investments will be protected from arbitrary expropriation,&#13;
and that the business case for the investment is not undermined through unplanned policy or regulatory&#13;
changes. Indeed, trade policy and investment policy are inherently linked in a GVC world. MNC governance of&#13;
GVCs also raises the importance of adherence to global standards, in terms of productions process and outputs&#13;
as well as environmental and social standards (including labor and gender). Finally, because GVC trade is&#13;
predicated on outsourcing and subcontracting, inter-firm contracts, MNCs coordinating production networks&#13;
require guarantees that their intellectual property rights will be protected, and that their rights under contract&#13;
law will be enforced.&#13;
&#13;
 Box 1.2: What is being traded in GVCs?&#13;
 As discussed above, production and trade in GVCs depends very much on economics â&#128;&#148;most importantly the balance&#13;
 between production costs on the one hand and transportation and coordination costs on the other. Thus, it is natural&#13;
 that some products and services are more likely than others to be traded in GVCs. Subject to the definitional issues&#13;
 discussed above, and the fact that measuring GVCs is a science still very much in its infancy (see chapter 3 for further&#13;
 discussion), figure B1.2.1 provides an initial overview of the GVC intensity of different broad sectors in 1996 and 2011.&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;GVC intensityâ&#128;&#157; is measured here as the share of foreign value added that is embodied in exports from the sector. A&#13;
 few things stand out. First, almost all sectors have seen a substantial increase in GVC intensity over the 15-year period.&#13;
 Many sectors now have more than 30 percent of value added in exports coming from foreign sources. Second, the&#13;
 mining sector comes out as the most GVC intensive. This seems almost counterintuitive for a sector whose value is&#13;
 inherently in the subsoil of the host country. Yet, the reality is that for most countries (especially developing countries)&#13;
 much of the value that goes into mining comes from foreign sources, including finance, capital equipment, and&#13;
 technical services. Thus, the most intensive GVC sector, mining, is â&#128;&#152;additiveâ&#128;&#153; rather than a traditionally vertically&#13;
 segmented sector. Third, beyond mining, many of the most GVC-intensive sectors, and those that have seen the&#13;
 greatest increase in GVC intensity over the past 15 years, are in manufacturing. Manufacturing includes expected&#13;
 activities (automotive, textiles and apparel, electronics) and perhaps more surprising components (metal products,&#13;
 wood and paper). By contrast, agriculture and some services sectors remain relatively domestically focused and have&#13;
 not experienced significant globalization.&#13;

&#13;
    1.4. Why is this relevant for Southern Africa?&#13;
SACU-region GVCs are both a new reality and significant opportunity for expanding noncommodity exports to&#13;
support growth, diversification, and, ultimately, job creation in the region. They are a reality in the sense that&#13;
(as shown in figure B1.2.1) an increasingly large share of trade across most sectors is happening in these&#13;
networks. They also represent an opportunity to benefit from global and regional integration. This is&#13;
particularly true for the smaller countries in the regionâ&#128;&#148;Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS).&#13;
In the past, for a country to become an apparel exporter, for example, they would need design capabilities&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            4&#13;
&amp;#12;and textile mills; to export in the automotive sector they would need to produce engines and all&#13;
subcomponents, as well as having the scale to carry out assembly. Under the new trade dynamics, a country&#13;
can specialize in certain activities (sewing, specific components or subassemblies) and import the necessary&#13;
inputs. While this situation does not guarantee significant value capture and upgrading by developing&#13;
economies (see below), it does provide a vital first step on the ladder. Nowhere has this been more evident&#13;
than in China, and more widely across East Asia, where GVCs are at the heart of the open-economy growth&#13;
model that was responsible for the regionâ&#128;&#153;s success in growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. With&#13;
China as the regional engine, deep cross-border production networks were developed in East Asia. These&#13;
networks have taken advantage of low wages and large labor forces (China, then Vietnam, Cambodia, and&#13;
Indonesia); technology driven from lead countries like Taiwan, China and the Republic of Korea (increasingly&#13;
China, Malaysia, and Thailand); and logistics and services from Singapore and elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
With wages rising rapidly in China, parts of these GVCs are migrating elsewhere in the region and globallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
and the SACU region stands to benefit. Some estimates show that 85 million manufacturing jobs will migrate&#13;
from coastal China over the next 20 years (Lin 2011), and Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be a major&#13;
beneficiary. The SACU regionâ&#128;&#148;with its abundance of natural capital and surplus labor, along with relatively&#13;
good infrastructure and a quality institutional environmentâ&#128;&#148;should be in a good position to attract&#13;
investment for GVCs. Beyond assembly manufacturing that is typical of GVCs (including the apparel,&#13;
electronics, and automotive sectors), the region should also be extremely well-placed to compete as a location&#13;
for value addition to natural resources (mining and agriculture). Both types of investment would not only drive&#13;
exports and have the potential to create significant employment, but would also support productivity growth&#13;
by bringing global technologies and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
At the moment, however, the region remains at the margins of most production networks. South Africa has a&#13;
strong position in the European-centered automotive value chain, and Lesotho and Swaziland feed into the&#13;
U.S.-based apparel value chains; but for the most part the SACU region, like the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, has&#13;
yet to become established as a significant node in GVCs. One reason for this may be the regional nature of&#13;
most networks. Mexico and Central America have become the sourcing hubs for â&#128;&#152;Factory North Americaâ&#128;&#153;,&#13;
Central &amp; Eastern Europe and to a lesser degree North Africa for â&#128;&#152;Factory Europeâ&#128;&#153;, and parts of Southeast Asia&#13;
for â&#128;&#152;Factory Japanâ&#128;&#153; and increasingly â&#128;&#153;Factory Chinaâ&#128;&#153;. It is unclear how big a handicap Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
geographical distance from major markets may be for integrating into GVCs. In practice it is likely to be a&#13;
significant barrier in some value chains, but much less so for others. Moreover, production networks serving&#13;
European or American markets need not be the only focus. With growing markets in the region, a â&#128;&#152;Factory&#13;
Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; might increasingly be sustainable in the regional context.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as the region looks to GVCs it must consider not simply the question of joining GVCs, but also the more&#13;
difficult challenge of upgrading in themâ&#128;&#148;in terms of moving to higher value-added activities and generating&#13;
higher quality jobs. The task-based nature of GVCs creates opportunities for developing countries to establish&#13;
very quickly a position in global trade within a sector in which they may have had no previous experience. Such&#13;
a position brings with it exports and jobs, but does not guarantee their quality or sustainability. Lesotho is a&#13;
good example. In many respects, its entry into the global apparel value chain has been a huge success.&#13;
However, almost 30 years after receiving its first investments in the sector, Lesotho still has no locally owned&#13;
exporters or even subcontractors and no local firms providing any strategic goods and services inputs to the&#13;
sector. The failure of Lesotho to upgrade its position in the sector forces it to rely on wage restraint, trade&#13;
preferences, and fiscal incentives to maintain its tenuous position. For SACU countries, and for South Africa in&#13;
particular, joining GVCs is not enough; they must establish value-adding positions in these production&#13;
networks, and upgrade continuously if they are to use GVCs effectively as an instrument for inclusive growth&#13;

&amp;#12;    1.5. Objectives and structure of this report&#13;
In this context, the summary reportâ&#128;&#148;which draws on the results of 12 background papers (See Annex for a&#13;
list of the papers)â&#128;&#148;aims to establish greater clarity about the potential of GVCs to act as an engine for growth&#13;
in the SACU region, as well as the requirements to turn potential into reality. We also assess the implications&#13;
of GVC integration for trade, investment, growth, jobs, and productivity. There is much interest around the&#13;
region in GVCs, and much hope about their potential. For South Africa, GVCs are seen as a route to higher&#13;
manufacturing exports and greater value addition. For other SACU countries, GVCs are seen as a route to&#13;
diversification and global integration, and to leverage the possibility of greater investment from South Africa&#13;
itself. Yet, while the prospect of GVCs has become a regular part of the discourse in the region, fundamental&#13;
questions remain over the realistic potential to participate in and benefit from them. This regional study aims&#13;
to provide evidence that helps answer many of these questions. The main objectives of the study are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
      i. To understand trends of GVC participation and competitiveness of South Africa and the wider SACU&#13;
           region, the outcomes from this participation (exports, jobs, and productivity), and the factors that&#13;
           determine competitiveness&#13;
      ii. To map the extent of value chain integration across the region and identify barriers to deeper&#13;
           integration&#13;
      iii. To identify policies and actions that would be required to develop a globally competitive, high value-&#13;
           adding â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;&#13;

&amp;#12;2. Measuring SACUâ&#128;&#153;s GVC Integration, Performance, and Positioning&#13;
&#13;
    2.1. Introduction: measuring trade in value added&#13;
Understanding a countryâ&#128;&#153;s current participation in value chains is central to ensuring that its industrial and&#13;
trade policies can facilitate sustainable productivity gains and increased quality employment within higher&#13;
value-added sectors. But examining trade participation and performance through a global value chain (GVC)&#13;
lens requires a revised way of measuring and analyzing cross-border and cross-industry flows in goods and&#13;
services. In particular, competitiveness in specific components and tasks (rather than comparative advantage&#13;
in end products) is paramount, as it enables participation within larger production networks and, in turn,&#13;
increased value addition generated domestically over time.&#13;
&#13;
An important statistical implication of the growth of trade in fragmented global production networks is the&#13;
inflation of aggregate export figures. This results from the double and triple counting of intermediates as they&#13;
cross over national borders in the process of coming together to form an end product. For example, a Korean&#13;
semiconductor feeding into an iPod will be counted as a Korean export when it is shipped to Thailand to be&#13;
assembled into an internal drive, and then again in Thailandâ&#128;&#153;s exports as the drive is shipped to China for final&#13;
assembly, and then again from China as it is exported as a finished iPod. As a result, understanding a countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
gross exports as well as exports of domestic value added (DVA) is important for understanding trade&#13;
performance and GVC participation. It provides an insight into the critical issue of how trade performance&#13;
contributes to the domestic economy in terms of output, industry linkages, and employment.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, what matters ultimately for a country is not gross exports (which may include a significant share of&#13;
foreign value added via imported inputs) but the DVA embodied in gross exports. Figure 2.1 exemplifies the&#13;
decomposition of gross exports for the auto industry. DVA consists of value added created in the auto industry,&#13;
value added created in other sectors supplying the auto industry, and of re-imported intermediates (which&#13;
have been previously exported).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
At the industry level, DVA consists of value added created in a specific industry itself, value added created in&#13;
other domestic sectors supplying this industry, and previously exported intermediates reimported from&#13;
abroad for use in a given industry. In simple terms, an increase in DVA embodied in gross exports over time&#13;
signifies greater value addition within the country itself. As a function of productivity, it is associated with a&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s breadth, variety, and sophistication of tasks and activities (Taglioni and Winkler 2014). Beyond the&#13;
likely welfare and employment implications, this also has a broader significance for trade policy.3&#13;
                                                                                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;The remainder of this chapter makes use of several data sources to carry out an analysis of SACU countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
integration in global value chains. These includes standard bilateral trade data as reported from UN Comtrade,&#13;
which can be used to measure trade integration, trade in intermediates, global trade networks, and some&#13;
aggregate measures of value chain positioning. But the most important data sources come from multi-region&#13;
input-output (MRIO) databases, which combine global trade data with national production structures. This&#13;
includes some measures derived from the Francois et al. (2013) database4 and, most importantly, the Eora&#13;
database. The approach (see box 2.1) draws on the methodologies first developed by Hummels, Ishii, and Yi&#13;
(2001) in measuring vertical specialization. This was in turn formalized by Koopman et al. (2011) to derive&#13;
some of the most commonly used trade-in-value-added indicators, including domestic and foreign value-&#13;
added, as well as value added embodied in other countryâ&#128;&#153;s intermediate inputsâ&#128;&#148;that is, forward and&#13;
backward integration. Until the recent development of Eora, most of these indicators have only been available&#13;
publically for developed and other emerging economies through the WTO-OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA)&#13;
database5 and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) database6 (both released in 2013).&#13;
 Box 2.1: Methodological overview using the Eora database&#13;
 The simplified Eora databasea is disaggregated into 189 countries and 26 sectors per country (including a â&#128;&#156;rest of&#13;
 worldâ&#128;&#157; sector that captures statistical discrepancies).b It is thus the only multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis&#13;
 database that has relatively comprehensive coverage for Sub-Saharan Africa. This makes it well suited for longitudinal&#13;
 analysis of value chain integration of developing countries not included in other datasets. c The Eora database, much&#13;
 like the OECD/WTOâ&#128;&#153;s Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database, uses available information to produce measures of trade&#13;
 in value added for all countries.&#13;
&#13;
 In order to provide a meaningful context for comparative analysis with the five Southern African Customs Union (SACU)&#13;
 countries, 14 â&#128;&#152;peer countriesâ&#128;&#153; in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America have been selected. For each of the&#13;
 five SACU countries, decomposed value-added measures (using free on board [f.o.b.] prices, in current U.S. dollars)&#13;
 are provided at three points over and 11-year period (2000, 2006, and 2011) and placed next to peer countries in order&#13;
 to provide a relevant context for these countriesâ&#128;&#153; global value chain (GVC) integration. The peers include:&#13;
      ï&#130;§ Southern African Development Community (SADC) neighbors with resource-rich economies: Mozambique,&#13;
           Tanzania, and Zambia&#13;
      ï&#130;§ Other African countries that have been reasonably successful at integrating into GVCs: Kenya, Mauritius, and&#13;
           Rwanda&#13;
      ï&#130;§ A selection of Asian and South American low- and middle-income countries with economic and/or&#13;
           geographical structures that are similar to one or more SACU country: Argentina, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile,&#13;
           the Lao Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Democratic Republic, Paraguay, Peru, and Thailand&#13;
&#13;
 Key measures:&#13;
     ï&#130;· Domestic value added (DVA) embodied in exports: measures how much value is generated by domestic&#13;
         sources (within sector and from other sectors); the growth in DVA over time is a proxy for the benefits derived&#13;
         from exports&#13;
     ï&#130;· DVA embodied in exports as a share of gross exports: represents a good proxy for value chain participation&#13;
     ï&#130;· Foreign and indirect value added embodied in exports: is an indicator of the nature of value chain participation&#13;
         (forward and backward)&#13;
     ï&#130;· Import and export upstreamness: measures an industryâ&#128;&#153;s position along a production chain (relates to the&#13;
         number of stages away from final use that a country participates)&#13;
&#13;
 Sources: See Koopman et al. (2012) and Antras et al. (2012), respectively, for derivation of value-added and upstreamness&#13;
 indicators.&#13;
 Notes:&#13;
 a. The full Eroa database is at: http://worldmrio.com/.&#13;
 b. This is the condensed version of Eora with countries that have more than 26 sectors in their input-output or supply-use tables&#13;
 having their accounts simplified. However, this does not apply to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, which all have just&#13;
 26 sectors even in the expanded Eora database.&#13;
 c. In comparative analysis with the WIOD dataset, Eora was found to provide broadly similar results when calculating foreign and&#13;
 domestic value added, albeit with a slight upward bias (which is to be expected as the greater number of highly heterogeneous&#13;
 developing countries, many of which have been subsumed in WIODâ&#128;&#153;s rest of world matrix) (UNCTAD 2013).&#13;

&amp;#12;    2.2. Global trade integration&#13;
Trade opennessâ&#128;&#148;or trade share of GDPâ&#128;&#148;is a standard measure to assess the importance of trade to a&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy, and by extension, its integration with global markets. Figure 2.2 shows trade openness&#13;
plotted against national wealth (measured as the log of GDP per capita). Traded shares of GDP increase as&#13;
countries grow wealthier, although, regardless of income level, small countries tend to have a larger traded&#13;
share of GDP than large ones. This is because large countries trade more internally whereas small countries&#13;
tend not to have sufficiently large domestic markets. Figure 2.2 shows that most SACU countries trade above&#13;
the level that their incomes alone would predict, with Lesotho and to a lesser degree Swaziland among the&#13;
most trade-dependent countries in the world. Overall the region sits in the middle between the highly&#13;
integrated East Asian economies and the poorly integrated South American ones.&#13;
&#13;
The SACU countries can be characterized as having two types of countries. First, Botswana, Namibia, rely&#13;
heavily on the mining sector (especially diamonds in the case of Botswana and Namibia) and the exports of&#13;
raw materials. Second, Swaziland and Lesotho have narrow but well-developed industries that drive most&#13;
export earnings: in the case of Swaziland it is sugar and (related) concentrated beverage syrups; in Lesotho it&#13;
is apparels and textile. South Africa sits somewhere in the middle, with a large share of exports in mining (iron&#13;
ore, gold, platinum, diamonds) but also a well-developed agricultural and manufacturing export sector.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Figure 2.3 shows that share of intermediates in exports varies substantially across countries and over time.&#13;
With the notable exception of Lesotho, all SACU countries have more than half their exports in intermediates.&#13;
Botswana records more than 90 percent of exports in intermediates, but this is skewed by the categorization&#13;
of diamonds, which alone accounts for more than 70 percent of exports. Both Lesotho and Swaziland show&#13;
substantial declines in the share of their exports in intermediate goods. In the case of Lesotho, the share of&#13;
intermediates fell dramatically from almost 50 percent in 2000 to just 12.2 percent in 2012. But while&#13;
intermediates tend to proxy for production chain integration, in the case of Swaziland and Lesotho, the decline&#13;
in intermediates is actually reflecting their strong integration into the apparel GVC, where these countries&#13;
specialize in exporting the final-stage product.&#13;

&#13;
Overall, SACU countries, with the exception of Lesotho, show less reliance on imported intermediates than&#13;
most peer countries. Again, the situation varies substantially by sector, although Botswana and Namibia fall&#13;
well below the peer average in every sector.7&#13;
&#13;
South Africa is clearly a critical regional node and a major player in global trade networks. Measures of network&#13;
centrality (table 2.1) show that South Africa is a particularly strong node within its local network (â&#128;&#156;local&#13;
centralityâ&#128;&#157; in table 2.1). It also rates highly in terms of its position in global networks (â&#128;&#156;global centralityâ&#128;&#157; in&#13;
table 2.1), although it still trails many of its more integrated peers.&#13;

South Africa and the region tend to be linked strongly to European trade networks for consumption goods but&#13;
to the Chinese production network for intermediates (figure 2.4). Despite its distance from the core of the&#13;
Chinese network, South Africa appears to play a stronger role as a regional node for Southern Africa in&#13;
intermediate trade than it does in final consumption trade. It should be noted, however, that trade in&#13;
intermediates with China is largely explained by commodity exports to China, rather than trade in vertically&#13;
specialized tasks.&#13;

    2.3. GVC integration&#13;
Looking at the share of DVA in gross exports is important to understanding the nature of exports and of GVC&#13;
integration. Figures 2.5 and 2.6 highlight significant differences among SACU countries in this regard, as well&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;as significant changes over time in some countries. While Swaziland (40 percent) and Lesotho (47 percent)&#13;
have the lowest shares of DVA among the entire set of peers, the rest of the region has DVA shares of exports&#13;
between 60 percent and 70 percent, generally in line with the peer countries, although somewhat lower than&#13;
the South American peers. Both Lesotho and Botswana have had declining DVA as share of exportsâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s case a striking 17 percent decrease, and 9 percent for Botswana. The period 2000 to 2011 covers&#13;
Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s integration into the textile and apparel GVC (facilitated in part by the U.S. Afri can Growth and&#13;
Opportunity Act (AGOA) and its third-country fabric provision), most likely explaining the scale of the change&#13;
over this time. The other three SACU countries largely maintained their share from 2000 to 2011. Among&#13;
comparators, Tanzania and Kenya also saw substantial decline in DVA as share of exports, while the Lao&#13;
Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Democratic Republic and Zambia saw substantial increasesâ&#128;&#148;which may be explained by their&#13;
concentration in shorter, less-sophisticated GVCs (especially in nonmining extractives). Rwanda, which&#13;
increased its exports and integrated into a number of regional and global food and beverage value chains, also&#13;
had a large decline in DVA (from 79 percent to 67 percent). The more industrialized economies within the&#13;
sample of comparatorsâ&#128;&#148;Argentina, Chile, Mauritius, and Peruâ&#128;&#148;saw small to moderate declines, while&#13;
Thailand experienced a slight increase.&#13;

 Box 2.2: The challenge of interpreting DVA results&#13;
 As noted earlier, what matters ultimately for a country is growing DVA (in nominal terms) over time, regardless of the&#13;
 relative share of DVA. But from the perspective of understanding GVC participation and performance, the&#13;
 interpretation of high or low levels of DVA growth is not always that obvious. While we want to see increasing DVA,&#13;
 rapid integration into global production chains is likely to result in lower DVA as a share of gross exports. In fact,&#13;
 evidence of decreasing DVA as a share of gross exports may indicate participation in longer and more sophisticated&#13;
 value chains in which more imported value added is in turn being re-exported (Taglioni and Winkler 2014). Increasing&#13;
 DVA may reflect growth in the services economy, which tends to have short value chains and high values of exported&#13;
 DVA as a share of exports.&#13;
&#13;
 Moreover, DVA growth is affected by important factors that are not linked directly to GVCs (at least not the variety of&#13;
 GVCs associated with vertically fragmented production). Most notably for SACU and other developing countries with&#13;
 large natural resource exports, growth in commodity exports and changing global commodity prices will shape DVA&#13;
 measures significantly. This is because natural resources exports have high DVA, regardless of whether they have&#13;
 strong links to domestic labor markets and supply chains. Increasing DVA can also signify increasing the quality of&#13;
 exports (higher unit prices), regardless of whether these exports are within GVCs. Thus, changing sectoral composition&#13;
 of the export basket will have a significant impact on the DVA measure.&#13;
&#13;
 Figure B2.2.1 provides a basic overview of the some of the different situations that may explain various DVA outcomes,&#13;
 based on (i) the level of DVA to gross exports, and (ii) the growth of DVA to gross exports. The figure underscores the&#13;
 importance of going beyond the aggregate analysis to understand better the factors shaping DVA performance, and&#13;
 the degree to which they are shaped by GVC participation and position. At minimum, it highlights the need to look at&#13;
 data at the sectoral level. Beyond this, assessing sectoral structure and performance at a qualitative level is likely to be&#13;
 important for interpreting DVA outcomes effectively.&#13;
&#13;
 Note that in the case of the analysis presented in this box, minerals exports have been excluded, so at least some of&#13;
 the effect of natural resources exports on the DVA figures is controlled for in the results presented here.&#13;
                                                                                                                           14&#13;
&amp;#12; Figure B2.2.1: Overview of various DVA outcomes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Considering DVA at the sectoral level (not shown) it is strikingâ&#128;&#148;if not entirely surprisingâ&#128;&#148;how much more&#13;
DVA as share of total exports is contributed by services sectors. Examining individual countries, this&#13;
disaggregation suggests that Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s overall stagnation is primarily attributable to slow growth in&#13;
manufacturing. Similarly, the pace of Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s DVA growth is greatest in services sectors, although these are&#13;
starting from a very low base. In Namibia, the leading sources of DVA growth are predominantly&#13;
manufacturing. South Africa, on the other hand, has a relatively balanced level of growth across sectors.&#13;
&#13;
More important than measures of domestic or foreign value added in trade is the nature of this participation&#13;
in global supply chain trade. This can be distinguishing between forward and backward integration in GVCs:&#13;
     ï&#130;· Forward integration, or indirect value added (IVA)â&#128;&#148;refers to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s share of value added&#13;
        embodied in other countriesâ&#128;&#153; exportsâ&#128;&#148;in other words, producing and exporting intermediates, to&#13;
        which importing countries will then add further value and export as finished products or further&#13;
        stage intermediates&#13;
     ï&#130;· Backward integration, or foreign value added (FVA)â&#128;&#148;refers to the share of foreign value added in&#13;
        embodied in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exportsâ&#128;&#148;in other words, intermediate inputs imported from other&#13;
        countries, to which the importing country will add value to and export as finished products or&#13;
        further stage intermediates.&#13;
&#13;
Both forward and backward integration matter, but neither should be inherently maximized. As discussed in&#13;
box 2.2, the products involved and the qualitative nature of the integration determine the benefits that accrue&#13;
from it. Backward integration provides access to quality inputs, which contributes to downstream&#13;
competitiveness; it also has significant potential to deliver productivity spillovers through access to global&#13;
frontier technologies. As such, backward integration tends to be particularly important for developing&#13;
countries as it links to a number of measures of structural transformation. But taken to the extreme, backward&#13;
integration may crowd out local production and limit domestic value addition. Similarly, forward integration is&#13;
an indicator of GVC participation and also provides opportunities to benefit from technology spillovers. But&#13;
the desirability of forward integration depends a lot on what is being exported and where you sit on the value&#13;
added chain. High levels of forward integration in developing countries can often be associated with higher&#13;
resource dependency and is negatively linked to measures of diversification and structural change (AfDB et al.&#13;
2014).8 On the other hand, countries like the United States and Japan have high forward integration by selling&#13;
leading-edge technologies (with high value added) into the early stage of global production processes.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            15&#13;
&amp;#12;Figure 2.7 reports backward and forward integration as a share of gross exports for SACU and peer countries&#13;
in 2011, and gives a perspective on what is driving the broad measure of GVC participation. This is followed in&#13;
figure 2.8 with an illustration of growth in forward and backward integration over the decade. It shows that,&#13;
overall, the SACU countries tend to be slightly less forward integrated than peers and slightly more backward&#13;
integrated; but with the exception of Lesotho, growth in both forward and backward integration is trailing&#13;
many peers. Reviewing each country briefly:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Botswana: Much more forward integrated (36 percent) than backward (23 percent), although&#13;
         forward integration is likely to be distorted by diamonds, as is suggested by the very low growth over&#13;
         the past decade (1 percent). Backward integration is relatively high, but growing slowly.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lesotho: Highest level of backward integration (43 percent) and highest growth (20 percent) among&#13;
         all peers. Forward integration is much lower (17 percent) and trails most peers (although growing&#13;
         rapidly), reflecting focus on assembly stage of apparel manufacturing.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Namibia: Slightly above average level (25 percent) and growth (14 percent) of backward integration,&#13;
         while forward integration remains limited (16 percent).&#13;
    ï&#130;· South Africa: Below-average backward integration (14 percent), which is common for larger&#13;
         countries (although Thailandâ&#128;&#153;s backward integration stands among the highest of the peers, at 26&#13;
         percent); forward integration relatively high at 28 percent. Growth is moderate in both FVA and IVA.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Swaziland: Relatively high level of backward integration (28 percent) but lowest forward integration&#13;
         among all peers (12 percent); growth in both FVA and IVA among the lowest of peers.&#13;

At the sectoral level, there is considerable heterogeneity among these countriesâ&#128;&#153; growth rates in foreign and&#13;
indirect value added (not shown). For Botswana, FVA increased the most in transport equipment (18 percent),&#13;
along with metal products and wood and paper (17 percent each). As was the case for DVA, FVA in financial&#13;
intermediation declined substantially (â&#136;&#146;15 percent) while other manufacturing and agriculture were stagnant.&#13;
In Namibia, the largest growth in foreign content was in the metal products (20 percent) and electrical&#13;
machinery and transport sectors (19 percent each); financial intermediation also showed a sharp decline in&#13;
FVA. For Lesotho, growth in foreign content was highest in services sectors (especially hotels and restaurants,&#13;
post and telecommunications, and transport). Swaziland showed a similar pattern of strong growth in services&#13;
FVA (with the exception of decline in financial intermediation), but showed much weaker growth in other&#13;
areas. Financial intermediation and agriculture consistently shows the lowest FVA as a share of gross exports&#13;
while transport equipment shows the highest foreign content. Other manufacturing sectors, including&#13;
electrical and machinery and food and beverages, also show relatively high foreign content across the region.&#13;
&#13;
For South Africa, FVA increases were largest in agriculture and services sectors, while manufacturing FVA&#13;
growth was modest. Perhaps more interestingly for South Africa is the fact that its FVA (backward integration)&#13;
is dramatically below the global average in all sectors but automotive (figure 2.9). In fact, for most&#13;
manufacturing and services sectors, South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s FVA is less than half, often closer to one -third, the global&#13;
average. Again, having relatively low FVA is common where there is a large domestic industrial base, but the&#13;
figures do raise some questions over South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s degree of GVC integration.&#13;

&#13;
Looking at performance in individual sectors is useful but runs the risk of obscuring the bigger picture,&#13;
particularly as sectors vary substantially in their contributions to GVC participation across the countries. Figure&#13;
2.10 aggregates sectors according to the OECDâ&#128;&#153;s classification of technology content in sectors. This&#13;
aggregation gives a better sense of where foreign content embodied in GVCs is coming from across the SACU&#13;
countries and the type of sectors that SACU GVC exports are feeding into. This is critical for understanding the&#13;
potential of generating spillovers from GVC participation. Data shows that Swaziland and South Africa (and to&#13;
a lesser degree Namibia) gain most of their FVA embodied in exports from manufacturing sectors, with a&#13;
substantial amount coming from high-technology sectors. Indeed, these countries compare very favorably to&#13;
peers, although they trail substantially behind Thailand (driven by large FVA in the electrical and machinery&#13;
sector) and Argentina (FVA in transport equipment). In the case of Swaziland, the high-technology FVA is&#13;
coming mainly from exports embodying foreign content in the electrical and machinery sector, while in South&#13;
Africa it comes from both electrical and machinery and the transport equipment sectors. From the perspective&#13;
of facilitating technology spillovers, Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s imported content is among the least favorable across all peer&#13;
countries.&#13;

&#13;
In terms of IVA, the story is similar, although the differences are less stark across countries. What is notable&#13;
for SACU and just about all peers is that the profile of their forward contribution to GVCs is much less&#13;
technology intense than their backward integration. This says something about relative positioning in GVCs.&#13;
                                                                                                                 18&#13;
&amp;#12;That said, contribution to services exports of other countries appears to be significant, which may represent&#13;
interesting opportunities for learning and upgrading.&#13;
&#13;
    2.4. GVC positioning&#13;
What is ultimately more important than participating in GVCs is capturing value in them. This depends, in part,&#13;
on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s positioning within a GVC. It can be upstream (production of inputs at the beginning of the value&#13;
chain) or downstream (production of goods and services toward the end of the value chain) depending on&#13;
country specialization. Countries specialized in upstream activities produce the raw material or the intangibles&#13;
involved at the beginning of the production process (such as research and design). Countries specialized in&#13;
downstream tasks specialize in the assembly of the final products or in customer services. Finally, countries&#13;
involved in activities in the middle and later stages of the value chain often focus on the standardized labor-&#13;
intensive manufacturing jobs. Again, a countryâ&#128;&#153;s ideal positioning depends very much on the value chain in&#13;
question and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s capabilities. For some most of the value is captured up stream, for others&#13;
downstream, and in some cases both.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 2.11 shows that most SACU countries export in upstream positions, relatively far from the final&#13;
consumers. The exceptions here are Botswana (distorted by the short value chain of diamonds) and Lesotho&#13;
(final stage apparel assembly). Turkey, Thailand, and Mauritius appear to show a pattern of importing relatively&#13;
upstream and exporting a stage downstream. By contrast, the South American peers export further upstream&#13;
than SACU countries. Between 2000 and 2012, almost all peer countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports became more upstream&#13;
(probably as a result of increasing fragmentation of global production), but South Africa, Swaziland, and&#13;
Namibia moved further upstream than most.&#13;

&#13;
To understand GVC integration and positioning better, it can be instructive to focus on specific sectors,&#13;
particularly those that are known to be traded intensively in GVCs. Figure 2.12 (panel a) shows that South&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports in all three GVC sectors are highly skewed toward final goods. In fact, outside automotive,&#13;
intermediate exports hardly register in nominal terms and are in decline. And the share of South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exports that are in intermediates is lower than all peers (Thailand, Turkey, Brazil, and Argentina) in both&#13;
automotive and apparel. It is also notable (panel b) that South Africa is running a large increasing trade deficit&#13;
across all three GVC products, which again suggests weak positioning in these GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               19&#13;
&amp;#12;Overall, figure 2.12 suggests that South African exporters are either badly integrated in GVCs in these key&#13;
sectors (that is, they are really not involved in vertical production networks at all) or that they are focused on&#13;
final stage production, where value addition tends to be relatively limited.&#13;

&amp;#12;3. Regional Value Chains in SACU&#13;
&#13;
    3.1. Introduction and intraregional trade patterns&#13;
Competing in global value chains (GVCs) will require scale economies that are limited in the region, particularly&#13;
outside of South Africa. For this reason, South Africa will play a critical role as a demand engine and gateway,&#13;
but it will rely on the rest of the region in order to benefit from differing sources of comparative advantage&#13;
across the countries. Indeed, regional integration in the context of GVCs is likely to be the key to successful&#13;
export-orientated growth in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). In this sense, the model is East Asia,&#13;
where value chain integration has led to the development of advanced regional production networks that have&#13;
underpinned its spectacular growth from a poor, underdeveloped, agricultural backwater to becoming the&#13;
global factory today. At the heart of this integration is the linkage between trade in goods; investment in&#13;
regional supply chains, technology, and business relationships; and the use of efficient infrastructure services&#13;
(telecom, Internet, transport) to coordinate dispersed production. Thus regional value chains (RVCs) in the&#13;
SACU have the potential to support not only regional industrialization but also the transformation of regional&#13;
agricultural markets.&#13;
&#13;
Historically, the SACU has had low levels of intraregional trade. But intraregional trade has grown in recent&#13;
years and has reached 14 percent of total member-country trade, well ahead of African averages. This is driven&#13;
partly by strong growth (from a small base) of exports from other SACU countries into South Africa. Still,&#13;
regional trade remains highly imbalanced, with South Africa running a large trade surplus with imports from&#13;
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS) (+80 percent); about 97 percent of all trade in the region&#13;
involves South Africa. Outside of South Africa, only Namibia and Botswana have developed bilateral trade of&#13;
any significance.&#13;
&#13;
From a sector and product standpoint, while most SACU countries are biased toward mining and other&#13;
commodities for global exports, intraregional trade is qualitatively different. In particular, trade in food and&#13;
manufactures dominates the regional picture, suggesting scope for value chain integration (see figure 3.1).&#13;
&#13;

Note: Diamonds are classified under â&#128;&#156;manufacturingâ&#128;&#157; in the official SACU trade statistics; they have been reclassified here under â&#128;&#156; ores&#13;
and metalsâ&#128;&#157; to reflect the commodity nature of these exports&#13;
&#13;
The nature of products exported from South Africa to the region differs significantly from those exported from&#13;
the region into South Africa. Specifically, outside of mineral fuels (the largest export sector), South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exports are dominated by vehicles and machinery and equipment, along with iron and steel. The trade appears&#13;
to be chiefly â&#128;&#152;end-productâ&#128;&#153; sales. For example, a review of the trade data on for motor vehicles (HS 87)9 shows&#13;
around 82 percent of trade is concentrated in end-products, with 18 percent (worth around US$220 million)&#13;
in parts and components. The exports from the rest of the SACU into South Africa are more eclectic, with soaps&#13;
and detergents being the single largest category, and cocoa products, iron and steel, and plastics featuring&#13;
prominently. There is some evidence of higher parts and components exports coming from SACU countries&#13;
into South Africa, although this still appears to be small in absolute terms.&#13;
&#13;
The brief overview of trade patterns outlined above gives an initial indication that integrated regional supply&#13;
chains are not yet prominent in SACU. However, some individual supply chains may have developed across the&#13;
regions. In the remainder of this chapter we provide a brief overview of the extent of SACU RVC chain&#13;
development in four sectors: automotive; apparel; agroprocessing; and meat, livestock, and dairy. These four&#13;
broad sectors include the key ones that are being prioritized within the regional industrial policy.&#13;
&#13;
     3.2. Regional value chains in manufacturing&#13;
The following sections on the SACUâ&#128;&#153;s automotive and apparel sectors summarize the extent of manufacturing-&#13;
oriented RVCs and challenges to deepening them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                    22&#13;
&amp;#12;Automotive&#13;
South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s most prominent involvement in a GVC comes in the automotive sector, where a number of&#13;
global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have manufacturing facilities in the country. Most of these&#13;
OEMs combine production for domestic markets with exports, supported by a range of industrial subsidies&#13;
linked to the Automotive Production and Development Programme (formerly Motor Industry Development&#13;
Programme). Ford, BMW and Nissan/Renault are located in Pretoria, Gauteng; Volkswagen and General&#13;
Motors are located in Port Elizabeth; Mercedes Benz in East London, Eastern Cape; and Toyota in Durban,&#13;
KwaZulu-Natal (figure 3.2). Around these long-established OEM operations is a fairly extensive local supplier&#13;
base. As of 2012 there were approximately 150 component manufacturers in Gauteng, 120 in the Eastern&#13;
Cape, and another 80 in KwaZulu-Natal (Lampbrecht 2013), although local suppliers are consolidating and are&#13;
increasingly foreign-owned.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
In Botswana, very little automotive activity has taken place since the closure of the Hyundai OEM facility in&#13;
Gaborone in 2000. Two operations that have significant manufacturing and export activities exist. The first is&#13;
Harness Manufacturing Botswana (Pty), a wire harness manufacturer that was recently acquired by a German&#13;
auto-supplier, and is contracted to supply German OEMs in South Africa. The second automotive OEM in&#13;
Botswana is Chloride-Exide, an aftermarket supplier of automotive batteries.&#13;
&#13;
While Lesotho has no history of automotive activity, two seat kit manufacturers are in the process of relocating&#13;
operations from South Africa for stitched leather products to Maputsoe and Maseru. These are mostly&#13;
outsourced subsidiaries of first-tier suppliers with operations in South Africa; they are looking at Lesotho&#13;
operations as a way to reduce labor costs and improve the stability of labor relations, as well as to draw on&#13;
stitching skills available from the existing apparel sector.&#13;
&#13;
In the context of these very limited, but possibly emerging RVCs, what potential exists for a broader extension&#13;
of parts of the South African automotive value chain into the region? The global dynamics of the automotive&#13;
GVC have mixed implications for the emergence of SACU RVCs, especially given increasing demand for scale&#13;
economies to lower costs and control of the supply chain through lead firms and first-tier suppliers. First, given&#13;
scale requirements and the lack of existing OEMs or first-tier suppliers in BLNS countries, it should be taken as&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               23&#13;
&amp;#12;given that OEM investment in these markets is unlikely. Thus, the focus is realistically on how to expand the&#13;
supplier base for the South African automotive cluster further into SACU markets. In this sense, opportunities&#13;
exist but may be limited in scope. The main reason for this is that OEMs and first-tier suppliers are increasingly&#13;
looking to develop highly localized clusters, where all the main suppliers are virtually co-located with the OEM.&#13;
This can be seen, for example, at the Automotive Supplier Park Rosslyn in (Gauteng) and at the East London&#13;
IDZ. In addition, the technical requirements for many component suppliers may, at least in the short term, be&#13;
too stringent to meet consistently in other BLNS countries, particularly in the absence of strong support and&#13;
institutions to help suppliers meet increasingly strict global standards. On the other hand, the more labor-&#13;
intensive and less-strategic elements of the value chain, like wire harness assembly, are precisely those that&#13;
are seen to be less critical for co-location. These elements are thus open to extension into relatively proximate&#13;
locations where labor cost advantages can be exploited.&#13;
&#13;
In an environment where competitiveness for BLNS suppliers is dependent on final delivered cost and&#13;
predictability of supply, trade facilitation issues make a significant difference to competitiveness. Evidence&#13;
from field interviews indicates that while transport costs matter, for most production that is currently being&#13;
considered in BLNS countries, cost savings from labor is adequate to create a buffer for higher transport costs.&#13;
The more important factor is predictability. BLNS factories are seen as essentially equivalent to factories&#13;
located in local clusters around the OEM, and are expected to be able to deliver orders directly into the&#13;
manufacturing process on a regular basis. Delays caused by border inconsistencies represents the most serious&#13;
threat to the sustainability of this model, as it would force BLNS suppliers and their OEM customers in South&#13;
Africa to hold larger stocks of inventory, undermining the cost benefits of the model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Textiles and apparel&#13;
The textiles and apparel sector is one that has offered mixed fortunes to the region over the past two decades,&#13;
but it is also one in which strong (if short) RVCs have been developing in recent years. While Lesotho and South&#13;
Africa have the by far the largest apparel sectors in the region, every SACU country has some activity in the&#13;
sector:&#13;
    ï&#130;·   In Botswana, a relatively strong sector existed in the early 2000s serving African Growth and&#13;
        Opportunity Act (AGOA) markets, but only a dozen commercial garment manufacturers remain. These&#13;
        include some still exporting, and several reliant local government tenders. Low levels of productivity,&#13;
        prohibitively high costs of transport, and expatriate work permit restrictions have undermined the&#13;
        competitiveness of the export garment sector in Botswana. Despite this, several companies are&#13;
        serving the South African market and at least one remains serving AGOA. Botswana also has three&#13;
        household textile (bed linen, duvet, and so forth) manufacturers, relying on fabrics imported from East&#13;
        and South Asia, and there is a toweling mill (weaving/dyeing and towel manufacturing), with the vast&#13;
        majority of its output sold to South Africa.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Lesotho has one fabric (denim) mill, a spinning factory, and around 45 garment manufacturers, fairly&#13;
        evenly split between large and very large Taiwanese/Chinese manufacturers geared to the U.S. market&#13;
        (AGOA), and South Africaâ&#128;&#147;owned manufacturers that cater for the South Africa market. Most of the&#13;
        latter are firms that relocated from South Africa (for lower wages and a more flexible labor regime).&#13;
        While Lesotho apparel exports used to be almost exclusively for AGOA, the South African market now&#13;
        accounts for the majority of firms and exports.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Namibia has only a few companies employing more than 50 people, the balance being small&#13;
        companies. One large company that had employed 400â&#128;&#148;a subcontractor serving a South African&#13;
        manufacturerâ&#128;&#148;closed in early 2014. This was the only company serving regional markets.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   South Africa still has the largest textile and apparel sector in the region in aggregate terms, but the&#13;
        sector has declined rapidly since the early 2000s. Imports captured some 50 percent of the domestic&#13;
                                                                                                               24&#13;
&amp;#12;          apparel market and also came to dominate fabric supply. South Africa still has around a dozen fabric&#13;
          mills but capacity for fabric production (weaving and knitting) has shrunk by around 50 percent since&#13;
          the late 1990s/early 2000s. The apparel industry has fragmented and become increasingly reliant on&#13;
          basic cut-make-trim (CMT) operations that are dependent on sourcing houses supplying the retail&#13;
          chains. Virtually all output is focused on the South Africa market, although it reaches throughout the&#13;
          region through the presence of the South African retail chains, which have become significant&#13;
          suppliers across the region.&#13;
     ï&#130;·    Swaziland has one spinning plant and around a dozen commercial10 garment manufacturers. Two to&#13;
          three were exclusively geared to the U.S. market under AGOA. Another two or three serviced both the&#13;
          U.S. and South African markets, after having shifted away from exclusive reliance on the United States&#13;
          in recent years. However, the United States revoked Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s AGOA eligibility at the end of 2014.&#13;
          The remaining factories supply the South Africa market, the majority on a CMT basis.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3.3 gives an overview of regional trade performance in the textile, apparel, and footwear sectors&#13;
(covering all HS sections from 50 to 67). Total exports from the region are over US$2 billion, having recovered&#13;
to levels from before the worldwide 2008 financial crisis. Intraregional trade has grown rapidly, particularly in&#13;
the apparel segment of the sector, as exports from the region shifted from external markets (principally the&#13;
United States) to South Africa. While the post-crisis recovery of global markets has somewhat lessened the&#13;
importance of the regional market in the past two years, the shift appears to be structural, indicating&#13;
increasing regional integration of textile and apparel value chains.&#13;

&#13;
The continuing pressure on South Africaâ&#128;&#147;based producers to lower production costs combined with the&#13;
growing scale of the regional retail market is creating greater opportunities for the development of integrated&#13;
RVCs in SACU. Yet realizing these opportunities remains fraught with difficulties. Without a more substantial&#13;
and diversified yarn and fabric industry in SACU, the potential for integration beyond the existing, low-value&#13;
CMT relationships is very limited. Beyond issues with access to fabric, three other issues have been barriers to&#13;
the development of value chain activities in BLNS countries. The first is skills at the technical and middle&#13;
management levels. However, rising wage demands from Asian expatriate technical workers have spurred&#13;
renewed focus in the industry to invest more in training to localize managerial and technical positions. The&#13;
second issue is access to finance at competitive rates. Few banks in SACU are prepared to finance the textile&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;and apparel industry at rates that are affordable to borrowers, given the historical risk profile of the industry.&#13;
Third is transport cost and speed/flexibility in transport, which has significant negative impacts on the&#13;
competitiveness of BLNS countries.&#13;
&#13;
    3.3. Regional value chains in agribusiness&#13;
The following two sections summarize the extent of agribusiness-oriented RVCs and challenges to deepening&#13;
them. The sections focuses on the agroprocessing (with emphasis on horticulture and sugar) and meat and&#13;
livestock sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agroprocessing (horticulture and sugar)&#13;
Intraregional trade in the agroprocessing sector (covering all HS sections 04 to 15 and 17 to 2411) is more than&#13;
US$2.5 billion and accounts for around 28 percent of all exports from the SACU region. However, trade in the&#13;
sector is dominated by South Africa, with limited participation from BLNS countries. This reflects the imbalance&#13;
in the production capacity across the region, with BLNS countries constrained by agriclimatic conditions,&#13;
market scale, and an underdeveloped input sector. In contrast to this, South Africa has a wide spectrum of&#13;
climatic regions that allow for varied production, better access to input factors, a more sophisticated logistics&#13;
industry, and a competitive environment that is stimulated by a significantly larger local market demand.&#13;
&#13;
The fruit and vegetable subsector reflects the above imbalances. South Africa produces more than 90 percent&#13;
of its own demand, with imports being utilized to smooth seasonal variations in production. Vegetables are&#13;
mostly locally consumed, with only 3 percent being exported. For fruit, however, more than 50 percent is&#13;
exported, more than 30 percent is processed, and less than 20 percent goes through domestic wholesale&#13;
markets. In the BLNS, however, the majority of fruits and vegetables are imported. For example, Namibia&#13;
imports 65 percent of demand, mostly from South Africa. Swaziland imports the majority of its demand, from&#13;
South Africa and Mozambique (Barrientos and Visser 2012; Emongor 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Cross-border activities in agroprocessing reflect the import and export dynamics outlined above. The major&#13;
flow consists of packaged goods from South Africa to the point of consumption in the lower demand countries.&#13;
Large South African retailers dominate regional supply chains, and largely dictate the dynamics in the industry.&#13;
Other SACU members respond to South African dominance by protection of their local industries, both through&#13;
elevated tariffs, quotas (for example, seasonal border closures and import bans), and other nontariff barriers&#13;
(such as sanitary and phytosanitary [SPS] restrictions).&#13;
&#13;
Examples of truly integrated regional supply chains are limited. In retail-dominated chains, retailers take&#13;
advantage of South African productive capacity, as well as of the inability of regional members to fulfil local&#13;
demand, to export into neighboring markets. In isolated cases, processors are in a position to utilize the&#13;
relative competitive advantages offered by the region and position themselves for delivery into export&#13;
markets. For example, a large South-African food processor with processing facilities in Swaziland relocated&#13;
production of specific products to Swaziland in order to take advantage of the lower cost of sugar. Other&#13;
region-wide supply chains include grape production in Namibia by South African-owned producers, which is&#13;
exported through Cape Town. In this case, the producer took advantage of the specific productive capacity of&#13;
the region, and combined this with its existing fruit portfolio to access international markets.&#13;
&#13;
In the sugar subsector (figure 3.4), there do exist a variety of RVC links, although the chains are relatively short.&#13;
The most notable downstream sugar activity is probably the production of the Coca-Cola concentrate from&#13;
Conco in Swaziland. Although this relies mainly on Swazi sugar, it exports to bottling facilities (mainly run by&#13;
SAB Miller) throughout the region. Mondelez (former Cadbury) uses Swazi and South African sugar for&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  26&#13;
&amp;#12;production of sweets in factories that span Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. Finally,&#13;
downstream sugar packing and distribution also takes place in each of those four countries.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3.4: Overview of the sugar value chain in SACU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Beyond basic repackaging and distribution activities in Botswana and Namibia, there remain opportunities for&#13;
expansion of sugar-based processing, both in terms of beverages and food (such as candies and chocolates).&#13;
Here, however, the market demand and the need for production scale will remain limiting factors. Indeed, the&#13;
structure of Mondelez production activities in the region highlight the importance of production for wider&#13;
regional markets to gain scale economies. The location of some of these production activities in markets like&#13;
Botswana and Namibia are historical and not necessarily based on the most efficient supply chain economics&#13;
for todayâ&#128;&#153;s markets. Such production facilities may remain in service, but they are not necessarily indicative of&#13;
significant value chain opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Meat and related sectors&#13;
Beef and livestock (along with poultry and dairy) represent a sector that should have significant value chain&#13;
trade, which thus far remains underexploited. Beef is the mainstay of the agricultural sector in Botswana,&#13;
Namibia, and (to a lesser degree) Swaziland, as well as a very significant part of the South African agricultural&#13;
sector. Namibia and Botswana are both net exporters of beef, while South Africa and Swaziland are net&#13;
importers. Botswana, Namibia, and Swaziland all have abattoirs approved for exports to the European Union&#13;
(EU).&#13;
&#13;
Trade in beef and cattle by SACU countries (illustrated in figure 3.5) can be summarized as follows:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Live cattle: The export market for live cattle to South Africa is an important market for Namibia,&#13;
        particularly for emerging communal farmersâ&#128;&#148;it contributed an average of 38 percent of Namibiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        total cattle producer income from 2011 to 2013. No direct live cattle exports are allowed from&#13;
        Botswana due to the fact that the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) has the sole right to export beef&#13;
        from Botswana. From time to time the government will allow live cattle sales (for example, to Angola&#13;
        and Zimbabwe), particularly from areas that face restrictions on EU exports due to foot and mouth&#13;
        disease (FMD).&#13;
    ï&#130;· Carcass: Botswana (around 9,000 tons per year) and Namibia (12,000 tons) export to South Africa;&#13;
        South Africa exports to Swaziland (around 4,000 tons). Botswana and Namibia exports to South Africa&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              27&#13;
&amp;#12;         tend to enter into the food processing sector, whereas most of South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports to Swaziland are&#13;
         processed and distributed by Swaziland Meat Industries Limited (SMI).12&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Raw hides: From Botswana and Swaziland to South Africa&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3.5: Illustration of the beef value chain trade in SACU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Various opportunities exist to deepen integration of the beef value chain within SACU. These include increasing&#13;
trade in animal feed between South Africa and BLNS as well as between Zambia and SACU, exports of value-&#13;
added beef products from BLNS to South Africa, further value addition to cattle hides, and collaboration&#13;
between beef export abattoirs. Taking advantage of these opportunities, however, will require overcoming a&#13;
number of constraints in the integration RVCs, including the following:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Animal health status: Namibia, Botswana and Swaziland and South Africa all have different veterinary&#13;
        zones with different veterinary statuses, of which exports are only allowed from disease free zones.&#13;
        These veterinary zones are largely determined by the prevalence of foot and mouth disease (FMD).&#13;
        The reinstatement of South Africa as an FMD free zone in February 201413 provides significant&#13;
        opportunities for further integration of the regional beef supply chains. The beef export supply chains&#13;
        of Namibia and Botswana to the EU and Norway are already integrated, by basically using the same&#13;
        supply chain through the Cape Town port to markets. The veterinary status is therefore a critical factor&#13;
        that needs to be safeguarded by each country to ensure that the country is able to trade in&#13;
        international markets.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Trade barriers: Various trade barriers in livestock and livestock products are currently in place in the&#13;
         region, which undermine the potential for supply chain integration. These include:&#13;
              o   Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s export monopoly and ban/restrictions on expo rts of live cattle: The BMC wields a&#13;
                  decade-long statutory monopoly over all beef exports. The retention of the statutory beef&#13;
                  export monopoly of BMC was again recommended by the Parliamentary Committee in their&#13;
                  2013 report for the short and medium term to allow for a reinvigoration of the national beef&#13;
                  sector, and the enhancement of the capacity of BMC to effectively compete in a deregulated&#13;
                  and competitive beef export market in the long term. Although this regulation ensures an&#13;
                  increase in capacity utilization of BMC abattoirs (and therefore reduces the overhead&#13;
                  slaughter cost per head), it effectively eliminates competition in the beef market in Botswana.&#13;
                  It also results in a situation where the export of live cattle is normally banned.&#13;
                                                                                                              28&#13;
&amp;#12;            o    South African livestock import regulations: New import regulations were instituted by the&#13;
                 South African Veterinary Services for the import of livestock into South Africa, and became&#13;
                 effective on May 1, 2014. These regulations essentially brought a complete stop to the export&#13;
                 of livestock from Namibia to South Africa.&#13;
            o    Bans on animal feed exports from Zambia: Zambia bans the export of animal feed to SACU&#13;
                 countries on a regular basis, due to their internal supply and demand challenges. During the&#13;
                 past couple of years, export of animal feed to SACU was banned every year for a certain part&#13;
                 of the year, making SACU countries reliant on supply from South Africa&#13;
    ï&#130;·   High transport costs: For Namibia and Botswana, the inability to ensure backhaul dramatically raises&#13;
        the costs of transport of either live cattle outward (using specialized vehicles that are not efficient for&#13;
        standard inbound traffic) and animal feed inward. Transport alone is estimated to account for around&#13;
        one-third of landed cost for maize in Namibia and Botswana.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Low capacity utilization in abattoirs: More fundamentally, growth in the SACU beef industry, as well&#13;
        as deeper regional integration, will rely on improvements further upstream in the value chain. The&#13;
        major limiting factor that inhibits the Southern African beef export supply chain is the lack of sufficient&#13;
        cattle available for slaughter, which is a function of low off-take rates. This, in turn, is a complex&#13;
        challenge to address, as it has both technological and cultural determinants. In any case, one outcome&#13;
        is that beef abattoirs are not currently being utilized at full capacity,14 which negatively affects the cost&#13;
        competitiveness of the total beef supply chain. In addition, market opportunities under the current&#13;
        export regime in the EU are not fully utilized.&#13;
&#13;
In the poultry and dairy sectors, trade policy is an even greater barrier to RVC integration. Both Botswana and&#13;
Namibia have infant industry protection for their poultry sectors and Botswana also has this in place in its dairy&#13;
sector. In addition, quantitative restrictions on coarse grains used for animal feeds (to protect domestic&#13;
milling) substantially raises the costs of primary production in both industries.15&#13;
&#13;
    3.4. Services supporting regional value chains&#13;
Services are not only operating increasingly in GVCs (for example, as â&#128;&#156;services offshoringâ&#128;&#157;) but are critical&#13;
inputs that determine competitiveness in goods or services-producing value chains, whether global or regional&#13;
in scope. One reason is that the complexity and transaction intensity of value chain trade requires high-quality&#13;
services inputs for effective coordination. provide the critical link at each stage of the value chain: transport,&#13;
distribution, design, communications, research, marketing, and so forth. Further, quality services are critical&#13;
to enable firms to upgrade their position in value chains. In considering the potential for the SACU region to&#13;
engage more deeply with global and RVCs, it is therefore important to understand how SACU services sectors&#13;
are positioned to support value chain participation and upgrading. This is particularly relevant given that,&#13;
outside of South Africa, regional services sectors are relatively limited in scale and sophistication.&#13;
&#13;
A recent survey from the World Bank16 assesses the role of services enablers in shaping key RVCs&#13;
(apparel/footwear and agribusiness) across 14 African countries, including all SACU countries. 17 The survey&#13;
found that around 70 percent of lead firms make some use of these services (figure 3.6). However, the majority&#13;
of lead firms across all countries rely mainly on in-house provision of those services (just 43 percent outsource&#13;
these activities). Lead firms in SACU are significantly more intensive users of services than firms in the rest of&#13;
Southern and Eastern Africa; but they are also much more likely to access those services in-house. This&#13;
tendency is true both for business services and technical services.&#13;
&#13;
Why is this the case? Part of the explanation may be firm size. SACU lead firms are, on average, larger than&#13;
lead firms in the rest of the survey, and indeed the significance of the difference fades somewhat when firm&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  29&#13;
&amp;#12;size is controlled for. This fits with the evidence found elsewhere in the world that there is an â&#128;&#152;inverted U -&#13;
shapedâ&#128;&#153; relationship between firm size and outsourcing of services. The smallest firms cannot afford to&#13;
outsource services, but as they grow, they increasingly outsources to ensure quality and specialization of&#13;
services provision. However, once they reach a certain size, it can become once again cost efficient to&#13;
internalize services specialization and produce in-house.&#13;
&#13;
 Figure 3.6: Sourcing of services across 14 African countries,   Figure 3.7: Lead firms indicating adequately availability of&#13;
 as share of total services used (%)                             services across 14 African countries (%)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Source: World Bank data.&#13;
Note: In-house and outsourced services shares donâ&#128;&#153;t sum up to 100 percent as in some cases services are both made in -house and&#13;
sourced externally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, evidence from the survey suggests that limited outsourcing of services in the region is not&#13;
just about firm size but also reflects the availability and quality of services provided by the market. Lead firms&#13;
in SACU are substantially less likely to view services as being adequately available in the market. This finding is&#13;
supported by suppliers surveyed in SACU (on average, much smaller than lead firms), who indicate significant&#13;
challenges in accessing local services providers. Specifically, firms in SACU identify cost as well as quality and&#13;
delivery/reliability as more problematic than their peers in the rest of the region. Whether this reflects&#13;
substantial differences in services provision or rather differences in expectations on quality and cost is unclear.&#13;
In general, unavailability of adequate services appears to be a bigger problem for technical services than for&#13;
business services (figure 3.7).&#13;
&#13;
Evidence from the survey suggests that that all six types of services play an important role for the goods&#13;
suppliersâ&#128;&#153; linkages with lead firms. Quality and technical-related services stand out as being particularly&#13;
important for the lead firm relationship, which corresponds to the importance of quality standards in&#13;
supporting GVC participation. SACU-based suppliers rate the importance of services to lead firm relationships&#13;
more highly than do similar firms in East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
For firms that do outsource, not surprisingly the majority purchase from the national market. As figure 3.6&#13;
shows, importing services from the region (defined here as anywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa) is not substantially&#13;
more common than from global locations. For SACU-based firms, however, regional sourcing of services inputs&#13;
is somewhat more prevalent; this is mainly a reflection of lead firms in smaller BLNS markets importing services&#13;
from South Africa. Indeed, mainly of these lead firms have South African head offices and make use of the&#13;
same services providers as their South Africaâ&#128;&#147;based operations. But it also reflects what appears to be a better&#13;
regulatory environment for cross-border services trade. SACU-based firms, including lead firms and their&#13;
suppliers, report being significantly less constrained by regulatory barriers, such as the movement of people,&#13;
to accessing services from outside the country. And service providers in SACU also perceive foreign entry&#13;
restrictions and other discriminatory measures to investment and trade to be lower than peers in the rest of&#13;
Eastern and Southern Africa. On the other hand, the higher levels of restrictions on services trade between&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            30&#13;
&amp;#12;SACU countries and other regional markets in SADC and (eventually) the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement&#13;
(FTA), remain significant. The findings from this survey support previous research on barriers to cross-border&#13;
services in Southern Africa (Dihel, Fernandes, and Mattoo 2011) and highlight the importance of addressing&#13;
services trade restrictions in order to facilitate the development of competitive â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africa.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
    3.5. Summary of key findings&#13;
This brief overview of value chains in SACU highlights a number of opportunities as well as constraints to be&#13;
addressed to deepen integration and raise competitiveness. Many of these are industry-specific in nature and&#13;
would require a much more in-depth assessment in order to identify targeted policy interventions. However,&#13;
below is a summary of some generalized findings that emerge from the discussion above and the wider&#13;
assessment on which it was based:&#13;
    1. SACU countries tend to be concentrated at the highest and lowest stages of GVCs, and RVCs in SACU&#13;
       are disconnected from GVCs: Evidence from the case examples suggests that firms in SACU have&#13;
       limited participation in GVCs, with exceptions in automotive and apparel. Otherwise, global exports&#13;
       tend to be either at the very start of value chains (unprocessed minerals, beef) or at the assembly&#13;
       stage (apparel). Perhaps because of the nature of GVC integration, the RVCs that do exist are mainly&#13;
       serving regional markets rather than linking through lead firms to global markets.&#13;
    2. The region as a whole faces challenges of distance: Large distances from the main global markets limit&#13;
       value chain participation in the region. Even South Africa faces considerable competitiveness&#13;
       challenges due to do distance. This impacts both costs and, critically, time/flexibility, as shown in the&#13;
       case of the automotive GVC. Moreover, regional chains, including automotive, are dispersed&#13;
       geographically, limiting the potential benefits of clusters and raising transport and logistics costs.&#13;
    3. Within the region, scale is an even bigger challenge to both GVC and RVC participation, and compounds&#13;
       existing geographical and climatic constraints: BLNS countries, each with populations around 2 million,&#13;
       face major scale challenges to competing in GVCs and even RVCs. These challenges not only affect the&#13;
       size of the manufacturing sector/cluster that can develop but, perhaps more critically, impact access&#13;
       to industry-specific technical skills and support services that are critical to building a competitive&#13;
       cluster (see below). These scale challenges are compounded, in agricultural sectors, by agriclimatic&#13;
       conditions that limit severely the scope and competitiveness of BLNS countries in most agricultural&#13;
       sectors.&#13;
    4. The scale challenge at the regional level is compounded by huge intraregional imbalances, as well as&#13;
       path dependence that favors industry location in South Africa: In terms of developing intraregional&#13;
       value chains, the scale challenges of BLNS are compounded by South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s dominance in the region.&#13;
       With more than 90 percent of regional GDP, South Africa is not only the best location to ensure&#13;
       production scale but, more importantly, it is the obvious place to be for proximity to markets. This is&#13;
       compounded further by the fact that distribution and marketing arrangements tend to already be&#13;
       well-established in South African markets. Therefore, integrating value chain steps in BLNS markets&#13;
       often requires an active shift in strategic approach and potentially establishing entirely new supply&#13;
       chains. Justifying such a move when the vast majority of inputs come from South Africa and 90â&#128;&#147;95&#13;
       percent of the end market is in South Africa remains a daunting challenge.&#13;
    5. Productivity and supply chain weaknesses undermine the potential of BLNS to leverage resource and&#13;
       wage advantages to build a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; : Of course, opportunities will exist to leverage&#13;
       the comparative advantages of BLNS in a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; model, both in terms of accessing&#13;
       low-wage labor (in highly labor-intensive activities where the economics of production justify incurring&#13;
       higher transport costs) and accessing specific inputs (agricultural and minerals). At the moment,&#13;
       however, BLNS countries face weaknesses in productivity and high transport and logistics costs that&#13;
       undermine potential comparative advantages.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             31&#13;
&amp;#12;6. Trade policy aggravates the problem and undermines potential for downstream value chain&#13;
   development within the region: And potential for downstream processing, which is most relevant in&#13;
   agroprocessing, is constrained by a restrictive trade policy environment that undermines downstream&#13;
   competitiveness in an attempt to protect upstream markets. This can be seen in the intra-SACU trade&#13;
   restrictions on grain and feed, dairy, and poultry, among others.&#13;
7. Cross-border services trade offers important support to RVC formation, but it remains underdeveloped&#13;
   and restricted, especially with SADC partners and beyond: Building competitive RVCs will rely in part&#13;
   on having access to competitive transport and producer services. This is particularly important for&#13;
   supporting smaller firmsâ&#128;&#153; access to established supply chains. At the moment, cross-border trade in&#13;
   transport and producer services remains relatively limited in the region, although it is used more&#13;
   intensively than in the rest of Eastern and Southern Africa. Barriers to cross-border trade in services&#13;
   will be a constraint to developing RVCs beyond SACU borders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       32&#13;
&amp;#12;4. GVC Determinants and SACU Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
    4.1. Introduction and approach&#13;
Global value chains (GVCs) are often seen to denationalize comparative advantage (Taglioni and Winkler 2014),&#13;
as global lead firms construct global production networks by exploiting the most competitive locations for&#13;
specific activities. Given this situation, and in an environment where developing countries are urged to â&#128;&#156;joinâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
and â&#128;&#156;upgradeâ&#128;&#157; in GVCs (Cattaneo et al 2013), policy makers in developing countries rightly seek to understand&#13;
what it takes to do so. And in practice this means understanding what it takes attract lead firms to place stages&#13;
of the production value-adding process in your country. Here, the advice remains a bit less clear in several&#13;
ways. First, identifying what specific aspects of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness matter most for GVC trade remains&#13;
a question. Policy advice points to things like trade facilitation, trade agreements, nontariff measures (NTMs),&#13;
contract enforcement, and property rights protection (see, for example, OECD, WTO and UNCTAD (2013);&#13;
Cattaneo et al (2013)). On the other hand, the emergence of countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam as major&#13;
players in global production networks suggests that it may be all about globally low wages and large labor&#13;
forces; while the development of automotive value chains in Central and Eastern Europe points more to&#13;
relative wages, technology, and proximity. This points to a second practical challengeâ&#128;&#148;the fact that what&#13;
drives competitiveness in GVCs is likely to vary across GVC sectors as well as across GVC positions (upstream&#13;
or downstream). Finally, with competition for GVC investment taking place in a truly global market, factor&#13;
competitiveness relative to other countries matters a lot.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, the purpose of this chapter is to shed some light for policy makers in SACU countries on where&#13;
to focus efforts to drive competitiveness for GVC participation. We do this by generating â&#128;&#156;revealed factor&#13;
intensityâ&#128;&#157; measurements of traded goods, extending the traditional theory of factor-content of trade to&#13;
account for the factors that would be most relevant in task-based trade, and utilizing these measurements to&#13;
illustrate how underlying capabilities shape participation of SACU economies in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Underlying capabilities shape participation and competitiveness potential but are traditionally overlooked by&#13;
factor endowments (such as human and physical capital). This chapter presents the results of an analysis using&#13;
a â&#128;&#156;revealed factor intensityâ&#128;&#157; methodology (box 4.1) to identify the capabilities that are required for GVC&#13;
competitiveness, and applies the analysis to assess the prospects of SACU countries.&#13;
&#13;
 Box 4.1: Revealed factor intensity methodology&#13;
 The revealed factor intensity for each product j for a given factor type is summarized by the following equation:&#13;
&#13;
                                                     í µí±&#152;í µí±&#151; = â&#136;&#145; í µí±¤í µí±&#151;í µí±&#150; í µí±&#147;í µí±&#150;&#13;
                                                                  í µí±&#150;&#13;
&#13;
 where fi is the factor endowment level for a given country i and the weights (w) are given by:&#13;
                                                                   í µí±¥í µí±&#151;í µí±&#150; /í µí±&#139;í µí±&#150;&#13;
                                                    í µí±¤í µí±&#151;í µí±&#150; =&#13;
                                                               â&#136;&#145;í µí±&#150; (í µí±¥í µí±&#151;í µí±&#150; /í µí±&#139;í µí±&#150; )&#13;
&#13;
 The methodology uses a slightly modified version of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) that was proposed by&#13;
 Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik (2007) in generating their measure of revealed technology content (PRODY). This&#13;
 modified RCA serves as the weight in averaging the factor abundance across countries producing the product.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    4.2. The capabilities that matter for GVC participation&#13;
Based on existing literature on GVCs, we propose a range of capabilities that should be particularly important&#13;
for GVCs. These capabilities can be thought of in three different forms: (i) Fixed capabilities, which cannot be&#13;
changed by a country, such as proximity to markets and natural capital; (ii) Long-term policy variables, which&#13;
are capabilities that can be changed gradually over a relatively long time horizon (such as human, physical, and&#13;
                                                                                                                     33&#13;
&amp;#12;institutional capital); and (iii) Short-term policy variables, which are capabilities that can be changed directly&#13;
through a policy shift or negotiations (such as logistics connectivity, wage competitiveness, market access, and&#13;
access to inputs).&#13;
&#13;
The designation of GVC products is taken from lists generated by Athukorala (2010) and Sturgeon and&#13;
Memedovic (2010). To get the largest measure of GVC products, we combine the two lists. The original lists&#13;
by Athukorala in HS 1996 nomenclature and Sturgeon and Memedovic in SITC Revision 3 nomenclature were&#13;
converted to HS1988/92 nomenclature using a concordance table. In total, the Athukorala list provides 500&#13;
codes and the Sturgeon and Memedovic list provides 860 codes at the HS 1998/92 six-digit classification.&#13;
Duplicate codes were removed to yield a total of 1,237 product codes, covering around 20 percent of HS-6&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
Based on this coding scheme, table 4.1 shows the value of GVC exports for SACU and comparator regions.&#13;
SACU country exports produce less than 3 percent of the value of exports from the Association of Southeast&#13;
Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, and about 4 percent of the value of Eastern Europe18 exports. South Africa&#13;
accounts for about 92 percent of SACUâ&#128;&#153;s GVC exports.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Running a test of statistical significance between GVC and non-GVC products on each capability set (table 4.2),&#13;
we find that all of the proposed capabilities, except wage competitiveness, are more important in the export&#13;
of products known to be traded within production networks (â&#128;&#156;GVC productsâ&#128;&#157;). This is illustrated by the greater&#13;
intensity of GVC products compared to non-GVC products for each indicator type. Logistics, human capital&#13;
(skills), and institutions come out clearly as the top three most important capabilities. This suggests that&#13;
countries with strength in these capabilities should be more likely to participate in GVC trade.&#13;

with our understanding of the evolution of production networks in Eastern Europe, for example, where only&#13;
after years of assembly of imported car components did countries begin to produce and then export car parts.&#13;

     4.3. SACU country capabilities for GVCs&#13;
How does SACU the region compare against these capabilities? Figure 4.1 shows the standardized capability&#13;
levels of South Africa (left panel) and BLNS (right panel) compared to ASEAN countries,19 a region highly&#13;
competitive in GVCs. South Africa is separated from the rest of SACU given its size and level of industrialization.&#13;
Because the figures are standardized, capabilities can be compared to one another and read in terms of&#13;
standard deviations from the average country. Once standardized, we show the difference between the&#13;
standardized capability level of the SACU countries and that of comparator regions to create a â&#128;&#152;capability gapâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

&amp;#12;The results suggest South Africa has several advantages relative to ASEAN: logistics, natural capital, market&#13;
access, and access to inputs. South Africa lags behind ASEAN in terms of distance to markets, physical capital&#13;
per capita and wage competitiveness. South Africa has better levels of human capital and institutions than&#13;
ASEAN on average; Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland fare worse than South Africa but they are not&#13;
without some advantages relative to comparators. These countries are more competitive than South Africa on&#13;
wages. BLNS countries also have better access to inputs relative to both comparators and more highly rated&#13;
institutions than ASEAN countries on average. On the other hand, BLNS countries have, on average, lower&#13;
levels of logistics capabilities, market access, and natural capital than comparators, all of which are strengths&#13;
for South Africa. In short, there is considerable complementarity between South Africa and BLNS capabilities.&#13;
South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s weaknesses are balanced by BLNS strengths and vice versa.&#13;
&#13;
     4.4. Mapping capabilities with specific GVCs&#13;
Any product traded in GVCsâ&#128;&#148;like any other productâ&#128;&#148;requires a particular mix of capabilities to be produced.&#13;
GVC participation is to a great extent the result of the available mix of capabilities in the economy. With this&#13;
in mind, we compare the current capabilities of each SACU country with those that are required to produce&#13;
sector-specific productsâ&#128;&#148;this produces an â&#128;&#152;index of similarityâ&#128;&#153;, which helps indicate which GVC sectors are&#13;
reasonable targets for each country. Overall, it is important to point out that given existing capabilities, SACU&#13;
countries are not underperforming in GVCs. In fact, for the most part they are integrated about as much as&#13;
would be expected. One exception is Swaziland, which seems to outperform its capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Table 4.4 summarizes identifies sectors that would be â&#128;&#152;within reachâ&#128;&#153; based on current capabilities in each&#13;
country (green) and if the countries raised their performance in each of the â&#128;&#152;short termâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;long termâ&#128;&#153; policy&#13;
variables (orange). The findings suggest that clothing and leather goods are the GVC exports most closely&#13;
aligned with current capabilities. From the starting point, South Africa, and to a lesser extent Botswana, have&#13;
capabilities closer to some of the biggest GVC sectors by value, such as machinery/electronics and&#13;
transportation. Short- and long-term policy variables change the number and type of sectors in play for&#13;
countries. Textiles appear on the export horizon for several SACU countries even though fixed endowments&#13;
are not favorable for this sector. Intermediates generally tend to have a greater intensity in many capabilities;&#13;
and within sectors divided between final and intermediates, intermediate exports of machinery/electronics&#13;
appear ahead of final products.&#13;

&amp;#12;    4.5. Conclusions&#13;
The findings show clearly that certain capabilities matter for GVCs. The SACU region may be structurally&#13;
disadvantaged by being far from global markets, but other policy-related variables matter more, especially&#13;
logistics and institutions. Therefore, if SACU countries want to increase their participation in GVCs, they need&#13;
to focus on addressing these policy deficiencies. Key takeaways from this analysis are:&#13;
     1. GVC participation is based on a variety of factors but logistics, proximity to markets, and institutions&#13;
         seem to be most important.&#13;
     2. SACUâ&#128;&#153;s low participation in GVCs can be traced back to the level of capabilities these countries have.&#13;
         Nearly all SACU countries are performing roughly at the expected level.&#13;
     3. SACU countries can improve participation in GVCs by addresses existing policy gaps. Initially this can&#13;
         contribute to participation in sectors like leather products and clothing, and over the long term in&#13;
         sectors like machinery and electronics.&#13;

&amp;#12;   5. Structural Challenges in SACU: GVCs in Small and Remote Countries&#13;
&#13;
       5.1. Size and GVC participation&#13;
   The rise of global value chains (GVCs) has been offered up as the perfect example of technology overcoming&#13;
   geography, allowing for the realization of Heckscher-Ohlin comparative advantage on a global scale.&#13;
   Containerization has slashed transport costs and information and communication technology (ICT) is&#13;
   facilitating both the fragmentation and segmentation of work and its coordination and monitoring at a&#13;
   distance. With fragmentation, peripheral locations have a new ability to integrate more easily with the global&#13;
   core because they can specialize vertically in highly discrete tasks (Lanz et al. 2011). They can focus on the&#13;
   export of intermediate goods and services, earning the benefits of trade without the need to develop fully&#13;
   blown domestic industries (Gereffi and Sturgeon 2013). Thus, peripheral locations can overcome a variety of&#13;
   barriers to network entry, from minimum-scale economies in production, to small market size, to&#13;
   underdeveloped national systems of innovation. Nevertheless, it is also the case that trade in a world of GVCs&#13;
   remains far from frictionlessâ&#128;&#148;distance and scale still matterâ&#128;&#148;and the benefits of GVC participation are far&#13;
   from automatic.&#13;
&#13;
   The combination of task-based specialization and global market access helps overcome some of the scale&#13;
   disadvantages faced by small countries, but scale still limits the opportunities for GVC participation, most&#13;
   importantly, the prospects to upgrade in GVCs. As figure 5.1 indicates, small countries have relatively high&#13;
   levels of GVC participation (panel b), but the relationship is weaker than for trade overall (panel a). Some&#13;
   activities within value chains, particularly high volume assembly of standardized products and call center&#13;
   activities, require substantial scale to achieve cost competitiveness. Others require access to deep labor pools,&#13;
   often with highly specific knowledge and expertise. Moreover, large countries also have options for industrial&#13;
   policy (e.g., local content and joint venture requirements, R&amp;D spending schemes, etc.) that puts them in a&#13;
   much more favorable position to support upgrading within GVCs. Upgrading in small countries can also be&#13;
   blocked because the most innovative firms from small states tend to be acquired by multinationals from larger&#13;
   countries, with the core capabilities subsequently shifted to locations in the core to reduce transactions costs&#13;
   (Baldwin and Okubo, 2014).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       5.2. Distance, remoteness, and GVC participation&#13;
   The bigger challenge, both to GVC participation and upgrading, comes from distanceâ&#128;&#148;or, more accurately,&#13;
   from remoteness. Distance has two main impacts on how countries connect to GVCs. First, it impacts the cost&#13;
                                                                                                                        39&#13;
&amp;#12;and time required to get goods to their next stage of production, and to receive inputs from their previous&#13;
stage. Most obviously, distance matters because trade costs matter. In this regard, the disadvantages of small&#13;
states (small shipment sizes and inadequate trade infrastructure) are amplified for remote states because of&#13;
higher transport costs and the many other disadvantages that come with long transit times for goods&#13;
(exposure to humidity and high temperature, in-transit obsolescence, price changes, and so forth). Less&#13;
obvious, perhaps, is the time aspect of logistics, which has become increasingly important within GVCs as the&#13;
practices of â&#128;&#152;lean productionâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;fast supply chainsâ&#128;&#153; spread into more industries. Thus, while geographically&#13;
peripheral locations may not be entirely shut out of large-scale production of standardized goods, they face&#13;
challenges to participating in the lower-volume, higher-value segments that require delivery flexibility and&#13;
timeliness.&#13;
&#13;
Second, distance reduces the efficiency of coordination and collaboration because it creates barriers to the&#13;
direct, face-to-face exchange of tacit knowledge. Again, this is likely to have a greater impact on the higher&#13;
value-added activities in the value chain, such as design, advanced services, and customer service. It may also&#13;
have a specific impact depending on the characteristics of the sectors involved (natural resource-related&#13;
sectors versus manufacturing or services sectors, for example). While not as sensitive to transport costs, trade&#13;
in services can also benefit from proximity. This is especially relevant in complex, nonstandard services, where&#13;
face-to-face contact with consumers and between buyers and suppliers in the value chain facilitates the&#13;
exchange of tacit knowledge and uncodified information.&#13;
&#13;
But the concept of distance goes beyond simple physical location. This is particularly true in GVCs, where&#13;
efficient transport and effective communication and coordination are so critical. For that reason, we define&#13;
here a measure of â&#128;&#152;remotenessâ&#128;&#153; that goes beyond distance and beyond the traditional trade measure of&#13;
remoteness (which is normally calculated as the bilateral distance between trading partners, weighted either&#13;
by the size of the trade flow or the size of the partnerâ&#128;&#153;s gross domestic product [GDP]). Here, we extend this&#13;
measure to include logistics effectiveness and the existence of a common language between trading partners.&#13;
In this enhanced index of remoteness20 (figure 5.2), SACU countries appear relatively remoteâ&#128;&#148;although South&#13;
Africa ranks as the 28th most remote country, substantially less remote than if ranked using a simple distance-&#13;
based remoteness index. The extremely low ranking of Mozambique, given its geographic proximity to SACU,&#13;
highlights the potential importance of the SACU regionâ&#128;&#153;s English language capabilities in GVC participation.&#13;
Finally, figure 5.3 plots remoteness against GVC participation and suggests that proximity is hugely important&#13;
to GVC participation.&#13;

&amp;#12;    5.3. Opportunities and limits to overcoming scale and remoteness&#13;
What, if anything, can be done to overcome structural challenges of scale and remoteness? To organize our&#13;
thinking, we provide the simple 2x2 matrix in figure 5.4, which arrays country size on the y-axis (smallest&#13;
population countries at the bottom) and remoteness on the x-axis (inversedâ&#128;&#148;most remote countries on the&#13;
left). Large, proximate countries such as Turkey and Poland have the largest array of policy options at their&#13;
disposal, from just-in-time delivery of goods, to real-time collaboration on engineering issues. While inclusion&#13;
of Egypt in this category suggests that proximity and size does not guarantee successful integration in GVCs,&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s large population does give it advantages over smaller neighbors in the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa region, such as Jordan and Lebanon. On the other side of both spectrums, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia,&#13;
and Swaziland (BLNS), along with Pacific island countries and Uruguay, have the smallest array of policy&#13;
options, and may be forced to specialize in niche, low value-added activities in specific GVC segments, with&#13;
distance from core markets making tacit knowledge transfers difficult. In contrast, large remote states can&#13;
specialized in scale-intensive (standardized) goods requiring less continuous interactions.&#13;

&#13;
The evidence from cases studies of â&#128;&#156;small, remoteâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;small, proximateâ&#128;&#157; states appears to support the&#13;
discussion above. Overall, country size does not appear to have been a significant barrier to GVC participation.&#13;
Nicaragua and Macedonia are good examples of small countries that have achieved significant success in&#13;
attracting FDI in the automotive GVC. Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic have also managed successful&#13;
integration into GVCs in electronics, medical devices, and apparel. Within SACU, too, Lesotho and to a lesser&#13;
degree Swaziland have developed strong positions in global (and increasingly in regional) apparel value chains.&#13;
By contrast, remote countries tend only to achieve GVC participation in two situations: (i) where they are large&#13;
and have significant internal markets to support integration in automotive and/or electronics GVCs in the&#13;
assembly stages, and (ii) in mining and other commodity-oriented value chains.&#13;
&#13;
However, the sections on Nicaragua and Macedonia that follow, as well as the cases of Dominican Republic&#13;
and Costa Rica, highlight the limits that small countries face in deepening and upgrading their positions in&#13;
GVCs, both of which rely in developing significant linkages to the domestic industrial base. For small countries,&#13;
lack of domestic scale becomes a binding constraint; and, unlike countries with large domestic markets like&#13;
China, they are cannot stipulate stringent local content requirements. Ironically, the enclave nature of&#13;
traditional EPZs tends to aggravate the challenge of domestic integration and spillovers.&#13;
                                                                                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;Nicaragua case&#13;
The ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1992 increased the presence of&#13;
foreign automakers in Mexico and dramatically boosted finished vehicle exports. In parallel, suppliers that had&#13;
been producing in the U.S. border region of Mexico under the Maquiladora (export processing zone) program&#13;
prior to NAFTA pushed labor-intensive parts production farther into the interior of Mexico after NAFTA, both&#13;
to serve local vehicle assembly plants and for export. The recent signing of the Dominican Republicâ&#128;&#147;Central&#13;
America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) has encouraged the expansion of the regional production network&#13;
into Central America as well. Nicaragua has been the most recent beneficiary of this dynamic.&#13;
&#13;
Nicaragua is not generally considered among the safest of destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) due&#13;
to political uncertainty and its relatively poor business climate (ranked 119 of 189 economies in the 2014&#13;
World Bank â&#128;&#156;Doing Businessâ&#128;&#157; rankings21). However, the country has been able to leverage CAFTA-DR and other&#13;
preferential trade agreements, along with low labor costs and a better public safety/security environment&#13;
than its regional neighbors, to attract automotive FDI on a large scale. Two thirds of Nicaraguaâ&#128;&#153;s exports go to&#13;
the United States, 10 percent of which are automotive wire harnesses. A great deal of this FDI was channeled&#13;
through Nicaraguaâ&#128;&#153;s free trade zones, which offer a completely tax - and duty-free environment for&#13;
multinationals.&#13;
&#13;
Nicaragua currently hosts two global automotive wire harness suppliers, Yazaki (Formerly Arnecom) and The&#13;
DrÃ¤xlmaier Group. These companies have invested extensively in the country, and both produce automotive&#13;
wire harnesses primarily for final assembly plants in the United States and Mexico, for various American,&#13;
Japanese, and German automakers. Wire harnesses tend to be one of the more costly components in an&#13;
automobile; complex harnesses can also take 400â&#128;&#147;500 minutes of labor to complete, use a great deal of&#13;
expensive copper wire, and, as the electronic content of vehicles grows, increasingly incorporate a range of&#13;
expensive electronics control modules and elaborate connectors.&#13;
&#13;
These investments have generated around 10,000 jobs in the country and put Nicaragua squarely into the&#13;
automotive GVC, in a sector where they previously had no domestic industry. Yet, policy makers and&#13;
investment promotion officials recognize that the country cannot compete as a low-cost destination forever.&#13;
As a result, they are looking to both upgrade their position in the automotive GVC and deepen the links in the&#13;
chain by establishing domestic supply relationships. DrÃ¤xlmaier and Yazaki have been in discussions with&#13;
university officials to create automotive-specific training programs through institutes such as INATEC, a&#13;
technical and vocational training institution founded in 1991, and the National Engineering University.&#13;
&#13;
Establishing local supplier relationships appears to be more of a challenge, although opportunities have been&#13;
identified. For example, BMW has expressed interest in sourcing exhaust pipes for its motorcycles from a local&#13;
firm currently producing them for Harley Davidson. Additionally, PRO Nicaragua (the investment promotion&#13;
agency) has identified opportunities to produce seat covers and wooden parts for BMW automobiles in&#13;
Nicaragua. However, these investments have not yet materialized.&#13;
&#13;
A parallel strategy has been to cement Nicaraguaâ&#128;&#153;s reputation as a global hub for automotive wire harness&#13;
production through the processes of scale and vertical upgrading. In addition to attracting additional&#13;
investment to increase the scale of wire-harness assembly, PRO Nicaragua has been working to developing&#13;
the infrastructure needed to attract wire-drawing capabilities, which would represent a vertical move&#13;
upstream in the automotive wire harness value chain. However, the high cost of energy has made this move&#13;
uncompetitive for now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             42&#13;
&amp;#12;Macedonia case&#13;
Central European countries were integrated into Western European automotive GVCs in the 1990s in a process&#13;
similar to, but later than, North American integration. In the post-Soviet era, FDI from the European Union&#13;
(EU) was a boon to Central European economies moving away from the state-owned enterprise model and&#13;
from the Russian market. Central Europe continues to be an important part of the European regional&#13;
automotive production system. But countries further east, such as Macedonia, have begun to be considered&#13;
as investment locations as wages rise and labor shortages occur in markets like the Czech Republic, Hungary,&#13;
and Romania.&#13;
&#13;
Macedonia is a small country in the southern region of the Balkan Peninsula with just over 2 million inhabitants.&#13;
Because of the importance of regional production systems in automotive GVCs (in this case driving investment&#13;
to low-cost locations in Europe), and a largely positive investment climate with preferential trade agreements,&#13;
Macedonia appears to be becoming a popular location for automotive-related FDI. Macedonia has been quite&#13;
successful in attracting global automotive suppliers into their special economic zones (SEZs). According to the&#13;
National Bank of Macedonia, 26 percent of the FDI that entered the country in 2011 (in the form of equity&#13;
capital, reinvested capital, and other capital) was for vehicle and transportation equipment manufacturing.&#13;
Automotive investments in Macedonia have both increased the countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports of automotive parts and&#13;
repositioned them in terms of markets. Historically, the Macedonian small, indigenous automotive cluster has&#13;
been exporting to the Russian Federation.&#13;
&#13;
Macedoniaâ&#128;&#153;s FDI strategy has been marked by an aggressive pursuit of opportunities from global automotive&#13;
suppliers expanding capacity to serve the European market. The cluster and scale upgrading strategies used&#13;
increase both the variety of activities undertaken by foreign investors (for example, electronics and catalytic&#13;
converters) as well as the scale of production in specific product categories (such as automotive wire&#13;
harnesses). Once a few anchor investors like Johnson Controls and Johnson Matthey (electronics and catalytic&#13;
converters) had begun exporting, Macedonia continued to expand and diversify its base of global automotive&#13;
suppliers by targeting global automotive wire harness suppliers like Kromberg &amp; Schubert and DrÃ¤xlmaier.&#13;
&#13;
Macedoniaâ&#128;&#153;s distance from automotive assembly facilities in Europe did not make it an obvious choice for&#13;
parts production. Companies expressed initial concern about the countryâ&#128;&#153;s mountainous topography and&#13;
distance from Germany. However, the transparency at the border and lower labor costs relative to countries&#13;
with a better logistics proposition convinced many suppliers to select Macedonia. Firms have been generally&#13;
satisfied with the customs scheme in place, and have accepted costs associated with longer transit times to&#13;
take advantage of other factors that make a compelling business case for investing in Macedonia.&#13;
&#13;
The difference in technical and financial capabilities between foreign investors and local industrial firms&#13;
presents countries like Macedonia with opportunities for industrial upgrading and technological learning.&#13;
Nevertheless, similar to Nicaragua, Macedonia has struggled to leverage the presence of large multinational&#13;
suppliers to empower domestic firms. Immediate positive spillovers are readily apparent for direct&#13;
employment and the provision of basic services such as food service and maintenance. However, the scope&#13;
for long-term capacity building for the local industrial base remains limited. Theoretically, the indigenous&#13;
Macedonian automotive cluster stands to gain by developing relationships with multinational firms operating&#13;
in the country. For example, domestic Macedonian automotive suppliers could potentially use the technology&#13;
and workforce skills acquired through serving the local plants of global suppliers to upgrade their role in the&#13;
Russian automotive cluster, one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s fastest-growing markets and production locations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              43&#13;
&amp;#12;Global suppliers have created significant linkages to local universities, thereby developing high-end workforce&#13;
capabilities, but linkages to domestic suppliers have yet to materialize. Macedoniaâ&#128;&#153;s automotive cluster dates&#13;
back to the 1960s, when firms supplied the auto industry in the former Yugoslavia, where the â&#128;&#156;Yugoâ&#128;&#157; model&#13;
was produced. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, local firms had to adapt and focus on serving markets in North&#13;
Africa, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation. Local firms specialize in the production of simple plastic and&#13;
aluminum parts, foundries, brake components, and seat belt components. There is very little if any overlap&#13;
between the local clusterâ&#128;&#153;s competencies, products, and markets, and the requirements of global suppliers&#13;
manufacturing in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Managers from the leading foreign investors expressed little interest in buying from local firms; they saw this&#13;
as extraneous to their larger strategic objectives. Investment promotion and SEZ authorities are working to&#13;
match local suppliers with existing and incoming multinational firms, but they identified significant deficiencies&#13;
in local firmsâ&#128;&#153; technological capabilities and business culture. For example, one firm produces the same seat&#13;
belts they did in 1974 for Lada in Russia. A foreign investor like Johnson Controls requires one million light-&#13;
emitting diodes (LEDs) and 40,000 small printed circuit boards (PCBs) per week; this is currently an impossible&#13;
order for any domestic firm.&#13;
&#13;
According to one plant manager, the plant does not anticipate sourcing locally â&#128;&#156;even if there were producers&#13;
of key components in Macedonia todayâ&#128;&#157; (World Bank 2010). This statement reflects the fact that global firms&#13;
tend to have tightly constructed and carefully managed global supply chains already in place. According to&#13;
Johnson Controls, quality and consistency requirements are high for lower-tier suppliers and it takes the&#13;
average firm three years to make it onto the companyâ&#128;&#153;s approved supplier list. One executive stated th at his&#13;
company only relies on local firms for what he calls â&#128;&#156;non-serious purchasing.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
In addition to shortfalls in technical capacity, there may be mismatches in financial resources and business&#13;
culture. During our interviews, one informant stated that there have been ample opportunities for suppliers&#13;
in the local automotive cluster willing to upgrade their capabilities and meet stringent requirements of global&#13;
tier 1 automotive suppliers. A global supplier currently negotiating a significant greenfield investment in&#13;
Macedonia sought out a local hot forging supplier with capacity requiring a â&#130;¬1.5 million investment. There was&#13;
an opportunity for a local supplier to win a multiyear, multimillion euro contract. However, no supplier in&#13;
Macedonia was willing to make the needed investment, and the company instead turned to suppliers in&#13;
Bulgaria and Serbia. Moreover, smaller local firms operate with little R&amp;D investment, a lack of concrete&#13;
strategic objectives, and little to no industry collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, one of the key impediments to local firmsâ&#128;&#153; participation in the automotive GVC is the glaring disparity&#13;
in financial incentive between foreign firms in the SEZs and domestic companies. While foreign firms operating&#13;
in SEZs receive a wide range of benefits, local companies must pay customs duties on imported raw materials&#13;
and equipment, wait 3â&#128;&#147;6 months to receive value-added tax rebates if exporting, pay corporate and personal&#13;
income tax, have intermittent connectivity to the energy grid, and are generally located on expensive land.&#13;
Local firms are generally not involved in SEZs, regardless of their market orientation. There are no automotive-&#13;
specific programs to assist local firms in the process of upgrading or to help them reach the volume or quality&#13;
requirements of global tier 1 firms. While local firms ostensibly have access to SEZs for new investments, none&#13;
of the existing firms are large enough nor are they developing new technological capacities that would merit&#13;
consideration for SEZ status. â&#128;&#156;I am not aware of any domestic company that can make a 20 million euro&#13;
greenfield investment,â&#128;&#157; states one informant closely involved in state aid contract negotiations.&#13;

                                                                                                               44&#13;
&amp;#12;    5.4. Conclusions&#13;
The case examples suggest that while scale and distance are barriers to GVC entry, they are not necessarily&#13;
binding constraints. There are, however, limits to proximity. Both Nicaragua and Macedonia were considered&#13;
â&#128;&#152;close enoughâ&#128;&#153; by investors for the nature of the goods they were looking to produceâ&#128;&#148;labor intensive,&#13;
relatively time-insensitive products. Thus, when labor and other costs are sufficiently favorable to outweigh&#13;
simple transport costs, the equation works. When there is a greater need for speed and flexibility of delivery,&#13;
however, the equation may break down. This suggests that the opportunities may be narrow for SACU&#13;
countries. The other lesson from these case studies is that capturing opportunities requires an aggressive&#13;
investment promotion effort that is targeted to specific industries and investors, that takes advantage of&#13;
instruments like SEZs with significant fiscal incentives, and that leverages trade preferences effectively. These&#13;
may be relevant lessons for BLNS countries. Indeed, the experience of Lesotho in apparel â&#128;&#148;leveraging AGOA&#13;
and the factory shells program, combined with a strong outward effort from the Lesotho National Development&#13;
Corporationâ&#128;&#148;supports aggressive investment promotion in the SACU context.&#13;
&#13;
The much bigger challenge for SACU, as discussed previously, is to upgrade beyond these basic low-value, low-&#13;
wage value chain activities. This case studies underline how both distance (raising coordination costs and tacit&#13;
knowledge exchange) and scale (limited depth of local suppliers) make this next step particularly challenging.&#13;
In this respect, the answers are probably more long-term in nature and will require improving the domestic&#13;
skills base (of workers as well as the capacity of firms and managers) and leveraging ICT to carve out niche&#13;
positions where transport and coordination costs are less binding.&#13;
&#13;
There is little doubt that skills must be at the top of the agenda for small and remote states. Costa Rica&#13;
managed to achieve deeper domestic linkages and higher value added positions in large part because of the&#13;
overall skills level of their workforce combined with targeted skills upgrading and linkage efforts. But even this&#13;
proved unsustainable as Intel eventually shifted most of their activities out of the country. New Zealand, too,&#13;
provides a cautionary tale. In a country with globally leading skills, firms that successfully integrate into GVCsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
mainly in the services sectorâ&#128;&#148;tend to be bought out by rivals in larger countries and their operations shifted&#13;
to more central locations in the global production network. Nevertheless, failure to invest in skills surely&#13;
confines any country to rely on price competitiveness to remain in GVCs. And for small and remote countries,&#13;
inherent cost disadvantages likely mean that price competitiveness can come only from wage restraint. Brain&#13;
drain is indeed a risk for small, remote countries, but policies to retain skills and to support GVC-oriented&#13;
investment by the diaspora can help overcome these risks.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, ICT offers some hope for small and, especially, remote states to compete in a â&#128;&#152;weightless economyâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
Increasingly pervasive, ICT systems have moved beyond their earlier role as labor-saving tools to become core&#13;
platforms on which work takes place, products are built, and services are delivered. They are also increasingly&#13;
being produced in fragmented GVCs. Rendering features in a video game, for example, might be spread across&#13;
many small firms and even individual contractors working in several different countries; one creating the&#13;
characterâ&#128;&#153;s hand, another facial features, another background elements, another textures to be used by other&#13;
programmers, and so on. In this context, the â&#128;&#152;weightlessâ&#128;&#153; nature of ICT is particularly interesting for remote&#13;
countries, as it allows them to compete in a more level playing field with regard to cost and time to market.&#13;
The Philippines represents a great example of a remote country that has leveraged ICT to participate in&#13;
relatively high-value segments of services GVCs. Taking advantage of such opportunities, however, requires&#13;
investment in core ICT infrastructure, ensuring that markets for ICT services are competitive, and that ICT skills&#13;
are pervasive and deep.&#13;

&amp;#12;6. Trade and Investment Policy for Value Chain Integration&#13;
&#13;
6.1.    Introductionâ&#128;&#148;whatâ&#128;&#153;s different about trade in value chains?&#13;
Trade and investment policy is of particular importance for global value chains (GVCs), given the reliance of&#13;
GVCs on both exporting and importing as well as the strong role of foreign direct investment (FDI). Offshoring&#13;
location decisions are impacted significantly by trade and investment policy considerations. Preferential trade&#13;
agreements, for example, have traditionally shaped the geography of global production in sectors like textiles&#13;
and apparel. Beyond simply tariffs, other factors tied to trade agreements are crucial, including investment&#13;
policy (which may or may not be tied directly to trade agreements) and rules of origin (RoO). Again, the textiles&#13;
and apparel sector provides an example of how detailed considerations of RoO can determine whether or not&#13;
a country is able to position itself effectively as a location for GVC trade, and also shapes its possibilities for&#13;
upgrading.&#13;
&#13;
In a world of GVC production, firms and countries are highly interdependent, relying on each other as both&#13;
input and source markets. Thus, a traditional mercantilist approach to trade becomes counterproductive.&#13;
Firms in a production chain require access to low-cost, high-quality inputs from all over the world, enabling&#13;
them to free up resources to concentrate on their core competencies (Cattaneo et al. 2013). Slotting into&#13;
global production networks means that speed, predictability, and flexibility are crucial. Thus, supply chain&#13;
efficiency has emerged as a particularly critical factor for GVC trade. Nontariff barriers and other border and&#13;
behind-the-border policies and procedures that cause delays and raise costs undermine the capacity to source&#13;
imported inputs efficiently and hence adversely affect competitiveness in GVCs. The importance of&#13;
connectedness in GVCs goes beyond physical links and includes greater need for deep knowledge of&#13;
destination and source markets in terms of quality, cost, reliability, standards, and lead times.&#13;
&#13;
GVC trade also differs from traditional trade in the dominant role played by multinational corporations (MNCs),&#13;
in particular by cross-border MNC investments and in the management by MNCs of the global production&#13;
networks. Participation in GVCs is often dependent on FDI, and so the investment policy environment plays a&#13;
critical role. MNCs obviously require a policy environment that facilitates rather than constrains FDI in flexible,&#13;
import and export-oriented activities. MNCs also require assurance that their investments will be protected&#13;
from arbitrary expropriation, and that the business case for the investment is not undermined through&#13;
unplanned policy or regulatory changes. Indeed, trade policy and investment policy are inherently linked in a&#13;
GVC world. MNC governance of GVCs also raises the importance of adherence to global standards, in terms of&#13;
productions process and outputs as well as environmental and social standards (including labor and gender&#13;
standards). Finally, because GVC trade is predicated on outsourcing and subcontracting, interfirm contracts&#13;
are prevalent. Thus, MNCs coordinating production networks require guarantees that their intellectual&#13;
property rights will be protected, and that their rights under contract law will be enforced.&#13;
&#13;
In summary, participation in GVC-oriented trade requires that countries consider a number of policy-related&#13;
issues beyond the narrow confines of traditional trade policy. A failure to recognize this can lead to inaccurate&#13;
policy conclusions about the importance of bilateral trade imbalances, to significant underestimates of the&#13;
cost of protection, and to a failure to appreciate the importance of bilateral or regional trading relationships.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, it is important to remember that most value chains are not truly global but regional. Even in value&#13;
chains that do span globally most value is traded within regional confines. The economics of production and&#13;
distribution, the lead time and flexibility requirements, and the need for proximate interaction typically work&#13;
against complete dispersion in the case of most tasks and value chains. This means that while the GVC&#13;
discourse tends to highlight globalization and multilateralism, addressing integration at the regional level is&#13;
perhaps even more critical.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                46&#13;
&amp;#12;The remainder of this chapter discusses trade and investment policies in GVCs in more detail and assesses how&#13;
the trade and investment policy environment in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), including specific&#13;
regional agreements to which the countries are party, affects the potential for the region to build regional&#13;
value chains (RVCs) and to participate and upgrade in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
6.2.      Trade and investment policy in a GVC world&#13;
&#13;
Trade agreements and regionalism&#13;
The global and interconnected nature of GVC trade means that multilateral liberalizations tend to be most&#13;
effective, as restrictions anywhere along the value chain can raise barriers for GVCs, even when direct trading&#13;
partners have liberalized trade (OECD/WTO 2013). But while multilateralism may be ideal, the reality is that&#13;
bilateral, regional, and other preferential arrangements have been far more common. Regional trade and&#13;
investment agreements are also particularly relevant from a value chain perspective as they can shape RVCs&#13;
and the distribution of value added. Regional/Preferential trade agreements (RTAs/PTAs), and particularly&#13;
deep trade agreements, play an important role in the making of GVCs because they tend to address some&#13;
critical constraints to well-functioning supply chains. To begin with, trading across borders is always associated&#13;
with additional costs such as tariff duties, and these will likely be removed by PTAs. Deep PTAs also tend to&#13;
have provisions on trade facilitation, simplification of technical barriers to trade and other nontariff barriers,&#13;
and investment provisions, as well as competition provisions that can contribute to the proliferation of GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Empirical evidence also supports the role of RTAs on the formation of RVCs. For instance, Orefice and Rocha&#13;
(2011) study the effects of RTAs on trade in parts and components and find that countries having an RTA trade&#13;
on average 51 percent more in parts and components than countries without a trade agreement. To be&#13;
effective for facilitating global and RVCs, RTAs at minimum need to go beyond simple tariff liberalization and&#13;
include agreements on investment. Ideally, they should extend to address other policy areas that are&#13;
particularly important for GVCs such as the convergence or harmonization of standards and technical&#13;
regulations, dispute resolution, competition policy, and intellectual property rights (IPR). Agreements can even&#13;
extend further, such as facilitating cross-border industrial clusters through joint investments in GVC-enabling&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
Global average tariffs on manufactured products are low and have fallen considerably over recent decades;&#13;
this has been a major contributor to the growth of GVCs. But import tariffs remain a critical issue for GVC&#13;
competitiveness, as the cost of protection is amplified in a GVC world. What matters is not just the nominal&#13;
value of tariffs but also their distribution between different types of goods. Tariffs on intermediates are&#13;
particularly important as they become cumulative in a GVC environment, where intermediate inputs are&#13;
traded across borders multiple times, raising the costs to producers operating in production chains. 22 Tariff&#13;
schedules that place higher duties on processed than unprocessed goodsâ&#128;&#148;a feature known as tariff&#13;
escalationâ&#128;&#148;also have particularly negative impacts on developing countries in GVCs. The reason is that&#13;
escalation acts as a barrier preventing developing countries from upgrading to higher value-added segments&#13;
of the value chain, potentially locking them into lower-value, limited-processing activities. Tariff escalation&#13;
remains common around the world and impacts several of the most important GVC-oriented sectors. Table&#13;
6.1, for example, shows how average tariffs in OECD countries escalate up through the value chain from&#13;
unprocessed cotton (very low) to cotton apparel (relatively high average tariffs with substantial peaks). A&#13;
similar story can be observed in the automotive value chain, among others.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Nontariff measures&#13;
As import tariffs have been reduced worldwide, nontariff measures (NTMs) have risen in prominence and have&#13;
become a major trade policy tool with important implications for exporters and importers. NTMs include a&#13;
wide category of instruments such as sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), trade-related technical&#13;
barriers (TBTs), quotas, subsidies, anticompetitive measures, import or export licenses, export restrictions,&#13;
custom surcharges, financial measures, and contingent measures. Although NTMs may have a clear domestic&#13;
goal of preventing unfair trade or protecting the health of citizens, they become barriers (NTBs) when used&#13;
with a protectionist intent to restrict imports.&#13;
&#13;
Regardless of intent, inefficiently designed or poorly administered NTMs can adversely impact firms along the&#13;
value chain by raising trade costs, which inordinately affects GVCs that rely on multiple cross-border&#13;
movements. Moreover, some NTMs restrict GVC trade by increasing the time it takes to move goods through&#13;
borders. For example, SPS and other standards-related measures often result in goods being impounded at&#13;
ports, a situation that can lead to missed shipments (on the export side) and shutting down of production lines&#13;
(on the import side). In a world of integrated production, both can be the death knell for a local producer&#13;
attempting to operate in a global production network.&#13;
&#13;
Standards represent an important potential NTM for firms operating in GVCsâ&#128;&#148;especially small and medium&#13;
enterprises (SMEs). The complexity and heterogeneity of national standards is a key barrier to entry into GVCs&#13;
for SMEs. Moreover, lead firms in GVCs often impose firm- or industry-specific global standards that may differ&#13;
from the national regime, leading to confusion and delays at borders. Promoting convergence of standards&#13;
and certification and encouraging mutual recognition agreements can help alleviate the burden of compliance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rules of origin&#13;
While RTAs have contributed the formation of regional and global value chains, they are also associated with&#13;
important limitations in value chain functioning. One particular limitation is the disincentive they give to&#13;
producers to employ cheaper parts and materials from third countries due to their restrictive rules of origin&#13;
(RoO). RoO are important parts of trade agreements because they define the rules according to which a&#13;
product is considered as â&#128;&#152;originatingâ&#128;&#153; from a member country of a PTA and hence qualifies to enjoy preferential&#13;
market access to all members in the PTA. RoO are primarily used to prevent trade deflectionâ&#128;&#148;that is, to avoid&#13;
products from nonparticipating countries reaching a high-tariff partner via the transshipment of the product&#13;
through a low-tariff partner. This is a legitimate and relevant concern for most trade blocs, including SACU.&#13;
&#13;
However, in practice RoO are one of the single biggest challenges to GVC integration. They can distort and&#13;
constrain the choices that firms have when locating segments of their production chain abroad. In addition, in&#13;
a world of proliferating RTAs, firms seeking to participate in production networks established in countries being&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            48&#13;
&amp;#12;covered by a multiplicity of trade agreements will find it increasingly difficult to keep track of all the different&#13;
rules governing the multiple agreements. When an exporter produces one type of good and most inputs are&#13;
produced domestically, the costs of complying with multiple RoO may not be high. Yet, when the variety of&#13;
exports and market destinations increases and the fragmentation of production is expanded to more&#13;
countries, the costs of dealing with multiple rules and origins can be substantially higher and outstrip the&#13;
benefits provided by trade preferences. These costs may rise further if the foreign suppliers are not wholly&#13;
owned subsidiaries, but rather independent firms.&#13;
&#13;
So, how can RoO reconcile their legitimate goal of preventing trade deflection in a world of emerging GVCs?&#13;
Solutions along the two main components are summarized below:&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Harmonized, simplified, and transparent product-specific rules of origin (PSRO): Analogous to the&#13;
        adoption to uniform tariffs, the adoption of uniform, across-the-board rules fosters transparency and&#13;
        mitigates capture of special groups willing to use PSRO for protectionism. Leaving aside agricultural&#13;
        products that could still operate under the â&#128;&#152;wholly obtainedâ&#128;&#153; criterion, the adoption of a uniform&#13;
        value-content rule across all goods is a suitable option to increase transparency and diminish&#13;
        transaction costs. Asian PTAs such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) follow this principle by using&#13;
        a single value content rule requiring that 40 percent of the value of the final product (that is,&#13;
        nonoriginating imports cannot exceed 60 percent of the value of the final product) must originate&#13;
        from the countries belonging to the PTA for the vast majority of products. This rule is used in&#13;
        combination with diagonal cumulation,23 essentially amounts to full cumulation, making these&#13;
        agreements very supportive to vertical linkages and outsourcing.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Flexible and relaxed regime-wide RoO: Another avenue to make the architecture of RoO more&#13;
        supportive of GVCs consists of relaxing the use of various regime-wide mechanisms. This could be&#13;
        achieved by, for example, increasing â&#128;&#152;de minimisâ&#128;&#153; levels (which specify a maximum percentage of&#13;
        nonoriginating products to be used in the making of product without affecting its origin) so that some&#13;
        PSRO become nonconstraining. A second approach would be to adopt the absorption (or roll-up)&#13;
        principle, which allows nonoriginating materials having acquired origin by meeting specific processing&#13;
        requirements to maintain this origin when used as inputs in a subsequent transformation. This&#13;
        promotes second-stage transformation as nonoriginating parts in the first stage of transformation&#13;
        become considered as originating in the second stage. Finally, reforms of the broader origin regimes&#13;
        can expand the use of cumulation (as discussed above), in particular to adopt diagonal cumulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Services&#13;
Aside from the obvious fact that much offshoring is taking place within services value chains (for example,&#13;
business process outsourcing), the globalization of production chains has contributed to the growing&#13;
â&#128;&#152;servicificationâ&#128;&#153; of manufacturing: around 30 percent of the share of value added in manufacturing trade&#13;
(OECD/WTO 2013) and up to 40 different services may be involved when a manufacturing firm&#13;
internationalizes (Taglioni and Winkler 2014). There would be no GVCs without functioning transport, logistics,&#13;
finance, telecommunications, and other business and professional services to move goods and coordinate&#13;
production activities along the chain. Thus, services trade liberalization allows access to more efficient and&#13;
higher-quality services, enhancing the competitiveness of manufacturing firms and allowing them to better&#13;
participate in GVCs. Indeed, in many GVCs the highest value added lies in intangible services activities in&#13;
located either at the beginning (pre-production activities such as basic and applied R&amp;D, design,&#13;
commercialization) or at the end (post-production activities driven by marketing knowledge, such as&#13;
marketing, advertising and brand management, specialized logistics, and after-sale services) of the value chain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 49&#13;
&amp;#12;Ensuring access to services, particularly at the regional level, is critical to enable the establishment of&#13;
integrated regional markets that are attractive for GVC investment. But liberalization of services lags far behind&#13;
that of goods, both at the multilateral level and in PTAs. Aside from the political economy challenges, one of&#13;
the reasons for this is that services liberalization goes beyond border-based trade policies and requires reform&#13;
to investment policy (especially for Mode 3â&#128;&#148;commercial presence) and the domestic regulatory environment&#13;
(including licensing).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment policy&#13;
MNC-coordinated GVCs account for 80 percent of global trade but it is also estimated that the contribution of&#13;
local firms is very significant (40â&#128;&#147;50 percent of export value added). Patterns of value-added trade in GVCs are&#13;
therefore shaped to a significant degree by the investment decisions of multinationals. Countries with a higher&#13;
presence of FDI relative to the size of their economies tend to have higher GVC participation rates and to&#13;
generate more DVA from trade. Limitations on investment can impede firms linking into GVCs via inward flows&#13;
of FDI but also the ability to contribute to GVCs through outward FDI. Among the many barriers to FDI that can&#13;
hinder GVC participation are the following (Cattaneo et al. 2013):&#13;
    ï&#130;· restrictions on foreign equity ownership or the form of partnership (most bluntly, this involves&#13;
      prohibitions or quantitative restrictions of foreign ownership)&#13;
    ï&#130;· restrictions on the movement of key personnel (including work permits for bringing in staff even from&#13;
      within the company and broader quotas and restrictions limiting the use of foreign personnel)&#13;
    ï&#130;· domestic content rules (requiring firms to source from local suppliers)&#13;
    ï&#130;· restrictions on the repatriation of profits or other capital (exchange control)&#13;
&#13;
Beyond this, the basic protection of foreign investors (such as ensuring equal treatment to domestic firms),&#13;
property rights protection, and dispute settlement mechanisms (such as access to international arbitration)&#13;
are also critical for GVC investors. FDI restrictions and weak protection of foreign investors in many countries&#13;
is one of the principal reasons for the extensive use of export processing and other special economic zone&#13;
(SEZ) regimes for GVC-oriented foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
Bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment provisions in wider PTAs that set out basic protections and&#13;
limit many of the above restrictions are becoming increasingly common, particularly within PTAs that have an&#13;
explicit aim to support regional production networks. Blyde (2013) finds that integration agreements have a&#13;
positive and significant impact on the number of MNC-established, vertically linked subsidiaries24 hosted by&#13;
partner countries. Moreover, they find that deeper forms of integration agreements (FTAs and customs&#13;
unions) induce more cross-border production sharing than shallow forms (PTAs). The latter finding supports&#13;
the notion that deep integration agreements provide more incentives for the formation of GVCs than shallow&#13;
agreements because they tend to incorporate disciplines beyond the simple reduction of tariff rates, such as&#13;
investment policy, services, standards, and/or customs procedures. In so doing, they address a number of&#13;
dimensions that tend to be important for well-functioning supply chains (Baldwin 2012).&#13;
&#13;
An important part of investment policy is ensuring the domestic legal environment to protect of foreign assets,&#13;
including physical assets and intellectual property. With regard to intellectual property rights (IPR), the very&#13;
nature of outsourcing involves the application of know-how (designs, engineering, production and business&#13;
processes, and so forth), which is at the heart of the lead firmâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness in global markets. This&#13;
outsourcing involves contracting relationships with independent suppliers, raising an inherent risk of&#13;
replication of designs, technologies, and process. Similarly, in an environment where the production is&#13;
organized through a series of outsourced contracts to independent suppliers, the ability to enforce contracts&#13;
resolutely and efficiently is critical. Both IPR protection and contract enforcement in an outsourced&#13;
                                                                                                               50&#13;
&amp;#12;environment are difficult enough within a single legal system. In the context of GVCs, outsourcing may involve&#13;
a large number of countries where legal systems not only differ, but where enforcement mechanisms may be&#13;
weak and contracting institutions ineffective (Taglioni and Winkler 2014). How different national systems deal&#13;
with contractual frictions and incomplete contracts is therefore important in driving firm choices of location&#13;
and sourcing as well as firm boundaries (what they outsource) in GVCs (Antras and Yeaple 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Rules on protection of IPR have become a common feature of PTAs over the last two decades through either&#13;
specific provisions in trade agreements or as part of a BIT. However, the specificity and strength of IPR&#13;
provisions vary significantly across agreements, with PTAs led by developed countries (especially the United&#13;
States and the European Union[EU]) most commonly paying significant attention to IPR. By contrast, many&#13;
other PTAs lack any provision for IPR protection or merely call for â&#128;&#156;adequate and effective protectionâ&#128;&#157; of IPR&#13;
(Fink 2011).&#13;
&#13;
6.3.    SACU trade and investment policy and regional value chains&#13;
The SACU region is seeking to better position its trade policy to support RVC and GVC integration. Actions to&#13;
this end include deepening regional value chain integration; broadening the SACUâ&#128;&#153;s regional scope through&#13;
the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement (TFTA) encompassing SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and&#13;
Southern Africa (COMESA), and the East African Community (EAC); and extending and deepening preferential&#13;
agreements through the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU.&#13;
&#13;
The SACU trade regime has undergone considerable liberalization in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2006,&#13;
the average applied rate was reduced from 27.5 percent to 8.2 percent. Since then, tariff liberalization has&#13;
continued, although at a considerably slower pace. As of 2013, the simple average common external tariff was&#13;
7.3 percent and 59 percent of tariff lines are now duty free.25 South Africa and the SACU (de facto) have&#13;
significantly reduced the effective protection rates on most products, including intermediate products with&#13;
the exception of clothing &amp; textiles, automotive, and leather. Yet 28 percent of tariff lines have ad valorem&#13;
rates of 15 percent or more and the number of unique ad valorem rates is also high at 36, suggesting targeted&#13;
protection. Moreover, around half of SACUâ&#128;&#153;s non-ad valorem lines have compound duties. The cost of such&#13;
protection can be high for GVC sectors in SACU, and it also creates demands for tariff escalation. For example,&#13;
South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s clothing tariffs are high to counter cost pressures that producers face from high tariffs on textiles&#13;
inputs.&#13;
&#13;
It is also worth highlighting that, despite the broad movement toward liberalization, and despite a clearly&#13;
stated strategy to promote global RVC integration, substantial barriers to RVC development remain within the&#13;
intra-SACU trade policy environment. This is particularly the case in the agribusiness sector, which represents&#13;
probably the clearest opportunity for the development of integrated value chains in SACU, from the&#13;
perspective of national and regional comparative advantage. Trade restrictions (including import bans and&#13;
quotas, as well as duties of up to 40 percent) on grain, feed, dairy, and poultry restrict regional trade and&#13;
undermine the competitiveness of downstream producers, preventing the emergence of RVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Integration efforts such as COMESA, SADC, SACU, and the TFTA have all sought to liberalize trade between&#13;
countries in order to increase trade flows, diversify exports by overcoming the limits of small markets, and&#13;
deepen specialization through value chain integration. Nevertheless, NTMs remain pervasive at the regional&#13;
level. For example, permits are required for all second-hand goods, and to import meat, alcoholic beverages,&#13;
and medicines. Import levies apply to certain agricultural products and are collected at the first point of sale&#13;
by the different agricultural associations. Export levies are imposed on key minerals and on agricultural&#13;
products (citrus fruit and wine). Local content regulations are also prevalent. The impact of these barriers on&#13;
firms is significant in terms of cost and time delays. The commitment of Southern African countries to remove&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 51&#13;
&amp;#12;these barriers has focused so far on raising awareness and improving transparency, through identification and&#13;
monitoring of NTMs. While this is a major step forward, progress to resolve barriers, once identified, has&#13;
remained slow.&#13;
&#13;
Rules of origin also remain a potentially significant barrier. Since SACU has a common external tariff, it does&#13;
not need RoOs but they exist in SADC and given their importance in the context of GVCs, are likely to be central&#13;
to negotiation around the TFTA. Under interim EPAs and the EUâ&#128;&#153;s GSP for least-developed countries&#13;
(Everything But Arms), RoO for textiles and clothing and fisheries products are now more liberal than those&#13;
under SADC. However, it remains imperative that the SADC EPA leaves enough policy space for the&#13;
forthcoming harmonization and simplification of RoO between and among the TFTA, which will encourage the&#13;
establishment of production units, diversification, investment, and transfer of technology across the region.&#13;
&#13;
Perhaps most important, the region has not yet made significant progress in going beyond traditional trade&#13;
policy to establish an environment to support GVCs, particularly in the areas of services trade, investment, and&#13;
trade facilitation. At this stage, the SADC FTA does not include any concrete measures for services&#13;
liberalization. Given that services contribute 35â&#128;&#147;70 percent to SADC countriesâ&#128;&#153; GDP it is clear that what has&#13;
been left out is quite significant. A Protocol on Trade in Services was signed by SADC heads of state in 2012,&#13;
providing the mandate to progressively negotiate barrier removal, but it stops short of outlining liberalization&#13;
obligations. Member statesâ&#128;&#153; commitment to regulatory, administrative, and institutional reforms is receiving&#13;
very little attention at this stage of the negotiations. For example, an integrated transport market requires the&#13;
members to pay attention to the measures that inhibit the efficiency of the various services, in particular&#13;
logistics services, that are necessary for the development and optimal functioning of value chains; the&#13;
adoption and implementation of transport facilitation measures that would increase competitiveness; and the&#13;
development of integrated transport infrastructure that will reduce the cost of cross-border trade. This&#13;
requires a comprehensive approach to the services negotiations that considers the various linkages between&#13;
trade in goods, trade facilitation, and transport services.&#13;
&#13;
Some significant FDI flows have been related to the growth of the services sector, particularly in finance,&#13;
insurance and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and transport and communications. A framework&#13;
for investment cooperation between the SACU and TFTA in particular should explore ways in which to harness&#13;
the benefits for development from FDI flows related to the services sector. Similarly, it is undeniable that there&#13;
could be potential for the promotion of FDI related to production networks and other sectors that are&#13;
important for manufacturing trade between the SACU, the TFTA, and/or the EU. Research is needed on the&#13;
comparative industrial and manufacturing export structures of these groupings to identify sectors of&#13;
importance for bilateral investment promotion, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, and automotive,&#13;
among others. In this regard, information on the sectoral structure of current bilateral FDI flows between the&#13;
trading parties at the manufacturing subsector and firm level is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, substantial progress has been made on customs reform in the region. However, wider issues of trade&#13;
facilitation, including weak harmonization of standard procedures and poor predictability (especially from non-&#13;
customs border agencies) remain barriers to cross-border trade, particularly for integrated production&#13;
networks. This will be discussed in more detail in chapter 7.&#13;
&#13;
6.4.    Conclusions&#13;
Twenty-first century trade patterns, involving increasingly integrated and sophisticated investment,&#13;
production, trade arrangements, require new approaches to trade and investment policy. Furthermore, these&#13;
trade patterns require better coordination between trade and investment policies, as well as a complement&#13;
of appropriate industrial policies to strengthen productive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               52&#13;
&amp;#12;At the macro level, the relationship between trade agreements and GVCs should be considered explicitly when&#13;
designing policy options. Particular consideration should be given to (i) geographies of trade and the impact&#13;
of rule-sets within a region, (ii) the impact on economic shock transmission channels between countries, and&#13;
(iii) the effects of nontariff aspects of trade policy on GVC growth.&#13;
&#13;
For SACU countries looking to engage more effectively with GVCs and also integrate more deeply in RVCs, it is&#13;
also essential to ensure coherence and harmonization between trade and investment policies at domestic and&#13;
regional levels. In this context, the current approach to the TFTA (the most important short-term regional&#13;
arrangement) falls short when it comes to thinking about GVCs and RVCs. From the perspective of traditional&#13;
trade policy the TFTA shows limited ambition in terms of liberalization26 and fails to address adequately&#13;
fundamental issues of RoO, safeguards, trade remedies, and dispute resolution. It shows even less ambition&#13;
outside of the traditional trade policy domain, with limited efforts to address trade in services, investment,&#13;
and intellectual property rights, all of which are fundamental for facilitating the integration of RVCs.27 Indeed,&#13;
while RVCs in particular have become policy mantra in the region, the detailed trade policy content to support&#13;
them still lags well behind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               53&#13;
&amp;#12;7. Trade Facilitation for Value Chain Integration&#13;
&#13;
     7.1. Introduction and the importance of trade facilitation for value chains&#13;
The emergence of global value chains (GVCs) has changed the perspective on traditional barriers to trade,&#13;
highlighting even more strongly the importance of trade and transport facilitation. Surveys of developing&#13;
country suppliers indicate that transportation costs are the single biggest obstacle to entering, establishing, or&#13;
moving up GVCs (OECD/WTO 2013). And while geography plays a role, policy is ultimately most critical,&#13;
whether it is for infrastructure investment, trade facilitation at the border, or a conductive environment for&#13;
transport and logistics services. Recent studies indicate that the reduction of supply chain barriers to trade&#13;
would have a greater impact on growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and trade than the complete&#13;
elimination of tariffs. For example, the World Economic Forum (2013) suggests that the reduction of supply&#13;
chain barriers to trade could increase GDP by nearly 5 percent and trade by 15 percent, compared to less than&#13;
1 percent and 10 percent, respectively, for a complete tariff removal. Developing countries would benefit most&#13;
from improvements in trade facilitation, with the gains in Sub-Saharan Africa among the highest in the world.&#13;
&#13;
In a GVC context, where goods move in an out across borders, and production of one companyâ&#128;&#153;s component&#13;
in Country A is a critical input to another companyâ&#128;&#153;s assembly in Country B, the time and cost of goods&#13;
movement becomes of critical importance. Lead firms and intermediate producers in GVCs need reliable,&#13;
predictable, and timely access to the inputs and/or final products to satisfy demand on time. Recent research&#13;
shows that networked trade in parts and components is more sensitive to improvements in the importing&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s logistics performance than is trade in final goods (figure 7.1).&#13;
&#13;

Note: LPI = Logistics Performance Index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thus, for firms to operate effectively in a value chain environment requires access to modern, efficient,&#13;
logistics services. And developing such services is dependent, among other things, on an efficient transport&#13;
and wider trade facilitation environment. Creating this environment requires efforts along many dimensions.&#13;
It requires establishing reliable connections, at affordable prices. It needs efforts to optimize networks through&#13;
the integration of both international and local providers. It means reducing the cost of crossing the border&#13;
through trade facilitation initiatives. It also requires improving the business environment to help users and&#13;
suppliers of logistics services achieving economies of scale in their core business, through the externalization&#13;
of non-core activities. Finally, a good trade environment requires creating the conditions for logistics providers&#13;
to offer valued-added services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   54&#13;
&amp;#12;The Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) is playing a critical role in driving regional integration and is&#13;
currently engaged in developing a regional industrial policy built around the foundation of regional value chain&#13;
(RVC) integration. Making this a reality in the SACU region will require major improvements in the regional&#13;
environment for cross-border trade and investment to enable value chains to operate seamlessly across the&#13;
region, minimizing transaction costs and lead times. Significant efforts have been ongoing in the region to&#13;
promote integration through trade facilitation improvements, particularly in customs. But much remains to be&#13;
done, and the recent focus on RVCs requires a rethink of the progress and priorities of trade and transport&#13;
facilitation initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
This chapter looks at regional trade facilitation through the lens of value chains, with the objective of&#13;
understanding how the regionâ&#128;&#153;s trade and transport environment could be improved to facilitate more&#13;
extensive and deeply integrated regional trade, linked to competitive participation in global value chains&#13;
&#13;
     7.2. Intraregional freight movements in SACU&#13;
Historically SACU has had low levels of intraregional trade. But intraregional commerce has grown in recent&#13;
years and reached 14 percent of total member-country trade, well ahead of African averages. This is driven by&#13;
relatively strong growth (from a small base) of exports from other SACU countries into South Africa. But trade&#13;
in the region is highly asymmetric. South Africa accounts for 97 percent of all trade and runs a large trade&#13;
surplus (80 percent) with imports from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS). Only Namibia and&#13;
Botswana have developed bilateral trade of any significance. This reliance on South Africa is risky for the rest&#13;
of the region, as it raises costs for logistics firms and traders in BLNS.&#13;
&#13;
While most SACU countries are biased toward mining and other commodities for global exports, intraregional&#13;
trade is qualitatively different; in particular, trade in food and manufactures dominates the regional picture&#13;
(figure 7.2). This suggests that the trade and transport facilitation environment for regional trade is likely to&#13;
be more complex and difficult than it is for these countriesâ&#128;&#153; global exports. Commodity exports tend to be&#13;
large scale and operate on well-established infrastructure and trade relationships. Manufacturing and food&#13;
trade, by contrast, tends to involve smaller companies, smaller-scale shipments, and much wider scope for&#13;
border delays, supply chain interruptions, regulatory problems, and other logistics challenges.&#13;

&amp;#12;Freight movements in the region are highly concentrated along corridors and in specific commodities. Mining&#13;
export lines from South Africa generate particularly big volumes (see figure 7.3). The Durban-Johannesburg&#13;
corridor also plays an important role in international trade for the region. The Trans-Kalahari corridor that runs&#13;
from Walvis Bay in the West through Gaborone and connects to Johannesburg in South Africa will most&#13;
certainly carry more and more volume in the future as the port of Walvis Bay increases capacity. An alternative&#13;
route that member states are starting to use more is the Maputo corridor that connects Johannesburg with&#13;
the Maputo port in Mozambique. Between 2012 and 2018, growth in freight demand is expected to grow&#13;
relatively slower for intra-SACU trade (2.3 percent) than for the region overall (3.9 percent).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Intraregional trade costs, driven by distance and time, vary substantially across SACU states. Given the&#13;
importance of time and trade costs in value chainâ&#128;&#147;oriented trade, variations in time and cost may affect the&#13;
degree to which SACU producers can participate in RVCs, the types of value chains producers may participate&#13;
in, and the nature of activities they are likely to participate in. Costs are substantially higher for producers in&#13;
Namibia and Botswana (figure 7.4), meaning that to participate in RVCs, companies based in those countries&#13;
would likely need to participate in much higher value-added segments of RVCs than would companies based&#13;
in Lesotho or Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
These transport costs are also affected by unbalanced freight flows in the region. South Africa is involved in&#13;
99 percent of all goods movement by volume in the region. This has significant implications for vehicle&#13;
utilization and the efficiency of transport cost management. Unbalanced freight flows contribute to high&#13;
transport costs in the BLNS countries, and have a particularly big impact on overall cost competitiveness in&#13;
value chainâ&#128;&#147;oriented trade&#13;

    7.3. The regional trade facilitation environment&#13;
Regional infrastructure in SACU is broadly sufficient, but capacity and access constraints in ports and rail&#13;
infrastructure biases against the development of RVCs. Smaller-volume users and emerging industries have&#13;
difficulty participating as a result. For example, ports and rail infrastructure are at or near capacity across the&#13;
region, thereby crowding access and raising cost constraints. Containers were charged port tariffs nearly four&#13;
times the global average in 2012, while port costs for bulk commodities were 18â&#128;&#147;42 percent below the global&#13;
average (see figure 7.5). Moreover, resources devoted to regional infrastructure have tended to concentrate&#13;
on extractive sectors, which are not necessarily supportive of the environment needed for value chain â&#128;&#147;&#13;
oriented sectors. Thus, noncommodity sectors face both access and pricing constraints in the regional freight&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;

SACU borders have problems, but they are not binding constraints for intra-SACU trade; by contrast, border&#13;
performance on key corridors could hamper the development of a wider â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;. For&#13;
example, clearance times at Pioneer Gate, Mamuno (intra-SACU) are typically no more than 2 hours, whereas&#13;
clearance at the Beitbridge and Kazungula border posts (SACU-SADC border) can take up to 70 hours (figure&#13;
7.6 and figure 7.7). Competing in GVCs will require border improvements in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                57&#13;

&#13;
Within the SACU, lack of harmonization and predictability in border procedures (especially non-customs) is a&#13;
concern for producers operating in RVCs. Standardized procedures at individual border posts, in coordination&#13;
across countries, is essential for greater trade facilitation. Harmonization is happening across the region for&#13;
customs, but other border procedures (such as sanitary and phytosanitary [SPS] and health) are far behind&#13;
customs when it comes to developing and implementing standardized procedures at individual border posts,&#13;
and in coordination across countries. In addition, with many borders still not operating on a 24-hour/7 days a&#13;
week basis, efficient border clearance is partly undermined by imposed delays due to border closure.&#13;
&#13;
RVC assessments of four sectors (automotive, textiles and apparel, agroprocessing, and beef) provided&#13;
additional insights into challenges and policy entry points for trade facilitation, as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trade facilitation supports competitiveness&#13;
Trade facilitation will not â&#128;&#156;make or breakâ&#128;&#157; RVCs, but it has an important role in supporting competitiveness.&#13;
Across all four industries studied, a wide range of factors determine competitiveness at the global level, as&#13;
well as the potential to develop more integrated value chains in SACU. These range from fundamental cost&#13;
competitiveness (wages, productivity) to deep supply chain challenges (for example, cattle offtake in the beef&#13;
industry and lack of a competitive local fabric supply sector in apparel). In no situation is it the case that&#13;
improving the trade facilitation environment would fundamentally unlock competitiveness. But trade&#13;
facilitation does matter. Indeed, in almost all cases, speed-to-market, predictability, and flexibility was&#13;
identified as an increasingly critical determinant of competitiveness in a world of GVC-based competition. And&#13;
SACUâ&#128;&#153;s distance from the large global markets makes the issue of speed (as well as cost) particularly&#13;
challenging. From the perspective of deepening regional links, the cost and efficiency of transport is&#13;
fundamental to the value proposition. At least in manufacturing-oriented sectors, RVC development will focus&#13;
on firms in BLNS countries linking into South African production networks, and in most cases relying also on&#13;
inputs sourced from or through South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trade policy barriers spill over to trade facilitation&#13;
Both Botswana and Namibia, for example, protect parts of the agribusiness sectors with 40 percent tariffs&#13;
within SACU; they also close borders to certain goods during harvest periods. Moreover, nonharmonized&#13;
policies create delays in trade facilitation at borders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   58&#13;
&amp;#12;Box 7.1: Trade facilitation and RVC integrationâ&#128;&#148;lessons and challenges from the SACU retail sector&#13;
Although the emergence in regional production chains across the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) has been&#13;
limited, growth of the regional retail chain has been substantial. South African retailers with a presence abroad include&#13;
general retailers, like Shoprite, Pick and Pay, Spar, Massmart (a subsidiary of Walmart) and Woolworths. More&#13;
specialized retailers also have a presence, including furniture retailers such as Ellerines and clothing/fashion retailers&#13;
such as Mr. Price or Foschini. While the majority of regional RVCs are led by South Africa, a small number of companies&#13;
from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS) have established a significant presence in the region. Most&#13;
notable is Choppies, a Botswana retailer that currently has 28 supermarkets in South Africa and 13 in Zimbabwe.&#13;
&#13;
These retailers have managed to adapt to the challenges of cross-border trade in the region by adapting a number of&#13;
market-driven solutions. Logistics and transport companies are able to make a profit even when dealing with the small&#13;
volumes going to the BLNS. Just as important, these companies have increased the profits of their clients, allowing&#13;
them to pay for logistics and transport services. The growth of malls has facilitated market entry for the larger retailers,&#13;
and the organizational structure of retailers has also provided some solutions. Franchising allows for more local&#13;
sourcing and closer links to local authorities in the BLNS; and having a local presence often reduces the administration&#13;
problems of customs documentation. However, one notable finding from the assessment of the regional retail chains&#13;
is the fact that these cross-border players have the size and financial resources to absorb the costs of cross-border&#13;
inefficiencies and to invest in solutions.&#13;
&#13;
But even for these larger players, significant challenges remain to effective regional value chain (RVC) integration.&#13;
Many challenges reflect the small scale of BLNS markets and the significant asymmetries that exist in regional markets.&#13;
Examples of these problems include:&#13;
&#13;
Consignment complexity: Consignments supplied to BLNS can contain a large mix of products in one delivery that may&#13;
result in up to 2000 HS tariff lines or more that need to be administered. Freight forwarders are reluctant to move&#13;
such shipments as they do not have the capacity to deal with the complexity. In addition, customs authorities in some&#13;
of the BLNS states have limited capacity to deal with such complex manifests. The optimal consignment composition&#13;
for BLNS markets is not optimal for the freight forwardersâ&#128;&#153; capacity.&#13;
&#13;
SPS/border management (â&#128;&#156;the cheeseburger problemâ&#128;&#157;): The problem of complicated consignments can be further&#13;
aggravated when value-added processed food (food store products such as a cheeseburger) are part of a consignment.&#13;
These products consist of a variety of ingredients, including dairy, vegetables, grain, and meat within one product. In&#13;
Namibia, for example, there are currently no border or state veterinary documents that can accommodate such a&#13;
composition, and clearance agents end up filling out multiple forms for one product. This in turn causes confusion and&#13;
delays with border officials. The market is too small for a private company to invest sufficiently to develop border or&#13;
state vet documents and to train custom officials. And it is not a priority of government.&#13;
&#13;
Private standards: Private-label products, such as Woolworths own-branded products or Pick-n-Pay no-brand products,&#13;
are often based on different, albeit higher standards than local product standards. Problems arise as the standards of&#13;
these private label products do not match the local standards specified and hence do not â&#128;&#156;tick the boxes.â&#128;&#157; A company&#13;
like Woolworth manages its supply chains to high standards, where suppliers are tracked and regulated to adhere to&#13;
the requirements of the Woolworths retail chain.a They control their own supply system, where they vet their suppliers,&#13;
transport from suppliers, packaging and labelling of products, and finally distribution and transport to retail stores â&#128;&#148;&#13;
including the export process.b But challenges emerge both at national and regional level. For example, while&#13;
Woolworthâ&#128;&#153;s supplier code and expiry system allow full traceability from point of sale to the hectare of production, it&#13;
does not exactly match the requirements of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for tracking producers and&#13;
pack houses. Similar challenges are often experienced at the border, where dispensation from the relevant authorities&#13;
is often required. Were standards to be more â&#128;&#156;objectiveâ&#128;&#157; than â&#128;&#156;processâ&#128;&#157; focused, the use of the equivalence principle&#13;
would allow for appropriate private sector standards to be used for trade.&#13;
&#13;
Appropriate supervision of the supply chain by authorities: There are other areas where the realities of a modern retail&#13;
chain are not reflected in regulatory practice.c For example, with retailers that control the entire supply chain to the&#13;
point of sale, instead of border inspections it is possible to move inspection to the retail stores in the specific country&#13;
(market inspection), making it less costly. The current system of border inspection for all consignments is based on the&#13;
wholesale distribution model. In this model of distribution the products, once imported, are difficult and costly to trace&#13;
to the point of sale as the wholesaler distributes to a potentially wide number of different stores. As another example,&#13;
regulation for auditing the retail supply chain is also a practical challengeâ&#128;&#148;again because it was established for a&#13;
wholesale distribution model. At present distribution centers can be audited as food handling facilities, but again this&#13;
is by dispensation. The regulation of distribution centers does not match current business practice.&#13;
                                                                                                                          59&#13;
&amp;#12; Lack of whistle blowing: Companies in BLNS countries are often reluctant to point out restrictions in contravention of&#13;
 commitments between the SACU and Southern African Development Community (SADC). They will wait for another&#13;
 company to make the first move (a â&#128;&#156;hostage gameâ&#128;&#157;), to see if there are any repercussions of doing so and if so the&#13;
 other company will take the consequences. Due to the small size, proximity, and long-standing history, it is close to&#13;
 impossible for any BLNS company to keep anonymity.&#13;
&#13;
 Local sourcing challenges: Most of the products on offer in Southern African markets are sourced from South Africa.&#13;
 For instance, in 2001 Shoprite estimated that about 65 percent of its products in Zambian stores originated in South&#13;
 Africa,d with some perishable items being sourced from Zimbabwe. This influx of foreign product can cause political&#13;
 friction. This is evidenced in Tanzania, where Shoprite allegedly imported approximately 80 percent of their products&#13;
 from South Africa;e Shoprite was warned by the Tanzanian government that they could lose their operating license if&#13;
 they did not supply more local products. Shoprite in turn sold their Tanzanian operations to Kenyan retailer Nakumatt&#13;
 and exited the Tanzanian market, indicating the difficulty of developing a local supply chain. Several factors make local&#13;
 sourcing difficult. Small production volumes by producers and processors often do not meet the necessary demand&#13;
 from major retailers across a large market, especially if they have a centralized distribution model. In addition, products&#13;
 may not available. For example, as of March 2015 all poultry in Woolworths stores will be free range, but there were&#13;
 no free-range poultry producers in Namibia as of the end of 2014. Logistics are also important. There is a lack of reliable&#13;
 cold-chain distribution for perishable products; it may be more effective for a South African retailer to supply their&#13;
 foreign operations from a South African distribution center, where they have control over the entire chain, rather than&#13;
 supply stores in a foreign market from a supplier closer to the outlet, but with a higher risk of product spoilage.&#13;
&#13;
 The discussion above highlights the challenges of cross-border value chain integration in the region. Although these&#13;
 challenges push up costs, they also fragment the regional markets and thereby give greater pricing power to the&#13;
 companies operating in these markets. It is likely that in many instances the status quo generates higher profits to&#13;
 compensate retailers for their troubles. However these higher profits will be generated by the ability of the regional&#13;
 retailer to benefit from the economies of scale that come from being able to source and distribute regionally. The case&#13;
 of Shopriteâ&#128;&#153;s withdrawal from Tanzania shows there are limits to the extent to which retailers can offset greater costs&#13;
 by making the customer pay higher prices.&#13;
&#13;
 There are clearly areas where public-private dialogue can play a role in facilitating trade within SACU. Dialogue will be&#13;
 needed to provide direction on updating the regulatory framework to better reflect modern business practices of the&#13;
 retail chains. It is also important to promote more constructive engagement on the challenges for local sourcing.&#13;

Linking with GVCs and integrating RVCsâ&#128;&#148;a comprehensive approach&#13;
Linking with GVCs and integrating RVCs requires a focus on somewhat different issuesâ&#128;&#148;but a comprehensive&#13;
approach is important. In the assessments of the four industry value chains a framework emerged that&#13;
included a focus on: (i) linking/competing in GVCs; and (ii) building competitive RVCs. The requirements for&#13;
competitiveness, and the relative importance of trade and transport facilitation challenges, differ between the&#13;
two. For example, linking with GVCs tends to emphasize transport costs and port-related issues, while the&#13;
development of RVCs has a greater emphasis on border issues. On the other hand, it is quite clear that RVC&#13;
competitiveness cannot, in most cases, be divorced from global competitiveness (at least not in the long run)â&#128;&#148;&#13;
the survival of the regional chains depends on competitiveness in the global ones. Thus, resolving the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 60&#13;
&amp;#12;constraints to the RVCs will not be sufficient, if the fundamental global constraints remain binding. This goes&#13;
for trade and transport facilitation as well as the other issues identified in the report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Scale at both the market and the firm level remains a fundamental challenge&#13;
The theme of scale economies, so often discussed in the region, emerges again as an important determinant&#13;
of competitiveness at several levels, including South Africa with global GVCs, BLNS with South Africa, and firms.&#13;
As discussed previously, given the nature of GVC-oriented industries, the situation is particularly acute; and&#13;
even more so when the development of RVCs is considered. Scale is obviously a difficult issue to resolve, but&#13;
where policy failures and market failures play a role, at the very least these can be addressed by interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Attention to interfaces at the SADC level is critical&#13;
Attention to the SACU facilitation environment may not be a sufficient level of focus; attention to interfaces&#13;
at the SADC level is critical. One of the findings that emerges from both the overall and value chain â&#128;&#147;specific&#13;
assessments is that the trade facilitation environment in SACU is relatively good. By contrast, the challenges&#13;
of trading across SACU-SADC borders remain immense. Given the issues of scale in SACU, the growth of wider&#13;
SACU markets, and the developments toward wider regional agreements (such as the Tripartite Free Trade&#13;
Agreement[TFTA]) a focus on optimizing the situation within SACU alone would be short-sighted. From a value&#13;
chain development perspective, firms will certainly be looking beyond the SACU borders to exploit the&#13;
opportunities for RVC development. For industries like those studied in this report, lack of trade facilitation&#13;
could fundamentally undermine the potential for developing competitive RVCs, unlike sectors like mining&#13;
where large firms and large profits make trade facilitation challenges mainly a nuisance. In this context,&#13;
focusing on the SACU-SADC interface is likely to be critical.&#13;
&#13;
The picture outlined above is supported by various international benchmarks of performance in trade and&#13;
transport facilitation, where SACU countries, with the exception of South Africa, fare poorly. In fact, in almost&#13;
all cases, SACU countries rate in the bottom half and often in the bottom quarter percentile. This appears to&#13;
be driven substantially by issues of scale and location/landlocked status (in three of the five countries), which&#13;
contributes to particularly high transport costs. But the more detailed analysis also suggests there are&#13;
shortcomings in other parts of the trade facilitation and logistics environment.&#13;
&#13;
For example, it is revealing to compare results from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Enterprise Surveys28 for firms that sell&#13;
only domestically to those that operate across borders. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 indicate the share of firms&#13;
identifying transport and customs and trade (respectively) as major constraints. Two clear findings emerge.&#13;
First, exporters indicate greater constraints on both factors than do non-exportersâ&#128;&#148;this is commonly&#13;
observed in most countries. Second, and most important, the findings appear to support the broad results&#13;
from the international rankings. In South Africa, almost no firms identify transport and trade-related issues as&#13;
major constraints to doing business. Namibia also fares relatively well (perhaps due to its coastal location and&#13;
port access). By contrast, firms, and especially exporters, in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland show markedly&#13;
higher concerns over the transport and trade environment.&#13;

    7.4. Implications for policies to promote value chain integration&#13;
With these general findings in mind, table 7.1 summarizes the main trade, transport, and trade facilitation&#13;
issues identified in the value chain assessments.29 For each issue, the table indicates whether it is most critical&#13;
for competitiveness in GVCs and/or for building RVCs in SACU. In the table one or the other value chain is&#13;
selected, although many of the issues are important for both.&#13;

developing competitive RVCs: (i) the differential impact of cross-border trade/transactions on small and&#13;
medium companies, (ii) lack of harmonization and predictability in border procedures, and (iii) the backhaul&#13;
challenge that raises transport costs substantially for producers and traders in BLNS.&#13;

&amp;#12;8. GVCs as a Source of Productivity Growth&#13;
&#13;
    8.1. Introductionâ&#128;&#148;spillovers from GVC participation?&#13;
Participation in global value chains (GVCs) brings with it increased exports, although growth in export value&#13;
added is not inherent. In fact, for countries integrating at the low end of vertically specialized value chains,&#13;
export growth is substantially offset by increased imports of intermediates that go into production. Indeed, in&#13;
some countries, domestic value added (DVA) embedded in GVC exports can be as little as 20 percent.&#13;
Nevertheless, net export growth has been experienced by virtually all countries that have integrated&#13;
significantly in GVCs. Moreover, for countries that have been previously weakly integrated in global trade or&#13;
focused on commodities, GVC participation can be an important channel of nontraditional export growth to&#13;
support diversification. And GVC integration typically coincides with increased foreign direct investment (FDI),&#13;
as foreign investors tend to dominate GVC exports. The evidence of FDI and export growth from countries&#13;
integrating into GVCs is fairly unambiguous, and this has very real implications on economic growth and macro-&#13;
fiscal health.&#13;
&#13;
But these â&#128;&#152;staticâ&#128;&#153; gains are not, in theory at least, the most important gains that countries can achieve through&#13;
GVC integration. Far more important in the long term are the productivity gains that countries achieve through&#13;
exposure to globally leading technologies and business practices. These productivity gains should have wider&#13;
implications for upgrading with specific value chains, but also should spill over and impact growth and&#13;
competitiveness across the economy. In addition, the gains from GVC integration should, ideally, translate into&#13;
more and better jobs.&#13;
&#13;
This chapter provides an assessment of the potential payoffs from GVCs in terms of growth-enhancing&#13;
productivity spillovers. This is followed in chapter 9 by an assessment of how export participation, and more&#13;
specifically exporting within GVCs, affects the level and nature of jobs. Both chapters provide quantitative&#13;
evidence from global datasets, but include specific focus on the experience of selected Southern Africa&#13;
Customs Union (SACU) countries.&#13;
&#13;
It is important to emphasize here that the analysis and findings presented in these two sections merely scratch&#13;
the surface of these important questions. Data, resource, and time limitations restricted what could be&#13;
achieved on these topics within this particular project. But new and better data is becoming available all the&#13;
time and new techniques are being developed by a growing set of researchers focused on understanding GVCs.&#13;
Thus, there is a clear and practical research agenda to test further these initial findings and delve deeper into&#13;
understanding the nature and determinants of productivity and jobs spillovers from GVCs, as well as the&#13;
impacts of GVCs on other issues such as trade and macro volatility and gender outcomes in the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
    8.2. Trade, GVCs, and productivityâ&#128;&#148;theory and evidence&#13;
Among the most important of the theorized benefits from participation in GVCs are the opportunities they&#13;
present for raising firm productivity. The sources of productivity spillovers are said to come both from forward&#13;
linkages in GVCs (as an exporter on the â&#128;&#152;selling sideâ&#128;&#153;) as well as from backward linkages (as an importer of&#13;
intermediate inputs on the â&#128;&#152;buying sideâ&#128;&#153;). Productivity spillovers from forward linkages are expected to come&#13;
from the requirements to meet demanding standards and technical regulations imposed by buyers (and the&#13;
technical support the buyers may offer to meet them), with subsequent demands diffusing down through the&#13;
domestic value chain. Productivity spillovers from backward linkages arise from increasing access to the&#13;
highest-quality inputs to production process. Beyond these, firms participating in GVCs may also benefit from&#13;
achieving higher-scale economies as well through the impacts of GVCs on labor skills and market competition.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12; Box 8.1: Flying geese and the East Asian experience with regional and global value chains&#13;
 Foreign multinational companies (MNCs) from the United States and Europe historically took an important role in the&#13;
 Japanese economy to transform the country into Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s leading economic powerhouse in the twentieth century.&#13;
 Through licensing and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) arrangements, Japanese firms successfully absorbed&#13;
 technology from overseas, mainly from European and U.S. MNCs (Ozawa 1974). This is described as the first and second&#13;
 patterns of flying geese (or domestic patterns) for Japanâ&#128;&#153;s learning-based approach to industrialization (Hayter and&#13;
 Edgington 2004). After the Second World War and until recently Japan, as a source of advanced technological&#13;
 independence, was the leading goose in its third flying geese paradigm (or international pattern). Japanese foreign&#13;
 direct investment (FDI) took the crucial role of developing its neighborsâ&#128;&#153; economies and technology through the&#13;
 process of dynamic industrial shifting among countries in the region to form East Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s regional value chains (RVCs)&#13;
 (Chen 1989). The most important impact of Japanese FDI was and is the dynamic change of factor endowments in East&#13;
 Asian host countries, which lifted their industries to higher value chain production over time through transfer of&#13;
 technology and knowledge from MNCs to their local partners. The MNCsâ&#128;&#153; role is anchored in investment decisions&#13;
 made by profit-seeking entities, and trade is driven by import and export firms, not primarily by states (Memis 2009).&#13;
 Thus, In the short run, host countries can generally benefit from the establishment of MNCsâ&#128;&#153; factories, which not only&#13;
 create jobs for local inhabitants but also generate wealth and public revenues. In the longer run, however, it is the&#13;
 transfer of technology and know-how from foreign MNCs that drives economic upgradingâ&#128;&#148;from producing primary,&#13;
 labor-intensive products to mature, capital-intensive products.&#13;
&#13;
 The RVCs in East Asia took on an increasingly global character as Japanese firms competed with Western MNCs in&#13;
 China in the 1990s, which led to the creation of â&#128;&#152;Factory Asiaâ&#128;&#153; built around final assembly in China. In doing so Western&#13;
 MNCs also source parts and components from the East Asia region, thus blurring the distinction between GVCs and&#13;
 RVCs, since MNCsâ&#128;&#153; activities extend well beyond East Asia. So China nowadays serves as the hub for production of parts&#13;
 produced in other countries in the region, to be assembled and exported as final products to world markets. It is&#13;
 estimated that intraregional trade accounts for more than half of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s total exports, and FDI into Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s export s&#13;
 now largely comes from other Asian neighbors (Gaulier et al., 2007). With inexorably rising labor costs for low value-&#13;
 added operations in China, assembly and mass production are now being shifted to other countries such as Vietnam,&#13;
 India, and Bangladesh; thus the geese are once more on the move.&#13;
&#13;
But do we have any evidence that this happens in practice? Anecdotally, the East Asian success story, and&#13;
specifically the â&#128;&#152;flying geese modelâ&#128;&#153; behind it, suggests that spillovers from GVC integration have cont ributed&#13;
to upgrading across the region (box 8.1). And a substantial body of empirical research show productivity-&#13;
enhancing effects of exporting (Wagner 2007; Songwe and Winkler 2012) and using imported inputs (Egger et&#13;
al. 2001; Amiti and Konings 2007). However, studies focusing on developing countries are virtually&#13;
nonexistentâ&#128;&#148;especially at the firm level.&#13;
&#13;
    8.3. Model and data&#13;
To test the productivity impact of GVC participation in developing countries, we take a cross-section of more&#13;
than 25,000 domestic manufacturing firms in 78 low- and middle-income countries from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Enterprise Surveys (2006â&#128;&#147;10) and estimate the impact of a domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s export share and share of imported&#13;
inputs (as proxies for GVC participation) on labor productivity. We test the results for the 78 countries overall&#13;
and then specifically for three countries in the SACU regionâ&#128;&#148;Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland.30 We also&#13;
take into account domestic firm heterogeneity, as GVC integration affects different types of firms in different&#13;
ways. Here we assess how productivity spillovers are affected by factors such as firm size, the productivity gap&#13;
between the firm and foreign firms in the sector (the â&#128;&#152;productivity frontierâ&#128;&#153;), technology use, labor force skills,&#13;
location (in agglomerations), and the extent of exporting and importing.31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                        66&#13;
&amp;#12; Box 8.2: Basic regression equation&#13;
&#13;
     The baseline equation (equation B8.2.1), which is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), takes the following&#13;
 form:&#13;
&#13;
     B8.2.1&#13;
 lnlpirst= Î± + Î²1gvcirst + Î²2(gvcirst*countryc) + Î³1(gvcirst*MF) + Î³2(gvcirst*MF*countryc) +â&#128;¦.&#13;
      + Î´lncapintirst + countryc + Dr + Dcs + Dt + Îµirst&#13;
&#13;
      lnlpirst indicates the labor productivity for domestic firm i in subnational region r, sector s and at time t in natural&#13;
 logarithms, defined as value added per worker. gvcirst designates our measure of GVC integration at the firm level. In&#13;
 the following, we use two alternative measures of GVC integration: a firmâ&#128;&#153;s total export share in output, exp, and a&#13;
 firmâ&#128;&#153;s share of imported inputs in total inputs, imp. countryc is a country dummy that takes the value of 1 if a country&#13;
 is the country of interest, and 0 otherwise. lncapintirst is capital intensity in natural logarithms. We also include&#13;
 subnational region, country-sector, and time-fixed effects. Standard errors are robust to heteroscedasticity.&#13;
&#13;
 MF is a vector designating the mediating factor of interest in the form of a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if&#13;
 the mediating factor lies within a predefined range, and 0 otherwise&#13;
&#13;
 The total impact of GVC integration in a country of interest on labor productivity for a specific firm characteristic (the&#13;
 mediating factor) is given by the sum of four coefficients: Î²1 + Î²2 + Î³1+ Î³2.&#13;
&#13;
 The total impact of GVC integration in countries other than the country of interest on labor productivity for the same&#13;
 firm characteristic is given by the sum of two coefficients: Î²1 + Î³1.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ prod = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s labor productivity relative to median labor productivity of multinational firms in sector in&#13;
       natural logarithms; a higher number indicates a lower productivity gap.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ tech = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s technology indicator. tech = iso + tech_for + website + email with tech Ïµ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4},&#13;
       where iso = 1 if firm owns internationally recognized quality certification and 0 otherwise, tech_for = 1 if firm&#13;
       uses technology licensed from foreign firms and 0 otherwise, website = 1 if firm uses own website to&#13;
       communicate with clients or suppliers, email = 1 if firm uses email to communicate with clients or suppliers. The&#13;
       technology indicator serves as a proxy for R&amp;D intensity which is unavailable.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ skills = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s share of high-skilled labor in firmâ&#128;&#153;s total labor force.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ size = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s total number of permanent and temporary employees in natural logarithms.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ aggl = regionâ&#128;&#153;s total number of manufacturing and services firms as percentage of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s total number of&#13;
       manufacturing and services firms. This measure is a proxy for urbanization economies (locational advantages)&#13;
       and covers both domestic and foreign firms.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ exp = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s share of direct or indirect exports in firm sales.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ imp = domestic firmâ&#128;&#153;s share of imported inputs in total inputs.&#13;
&#13;
    8.4. Main findings&#13;
Table 8.1 summarizes the main findings by presenting the sum of the coefficients of export share and imported&#13;
input share (respectively) on labor productivity for the three SACU countries and for the overall sample of low-&#13;
and middle-income countries.32 The results show a clear, positive association between GVC integration and&#13;
labor productivity in the overall sample and in the SACU countries, where the spillover effects are highest in&#13;
Namibia, slightly lower in South Africa, and very low in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
This suggests that while all three countries are benefiting from productivity spillovers from GVC participation,&#13;
firms in Swaziland have had less success in turning GVC integration into productivity gains. This situation in&#13;
Swaziland may be symptomatic of the wider problems of low levels of investment and slow productivity growth&#13;
in the country. Another theory is that it could reflect Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s extremely heavy reliance on South Africa,&#13;
both as a source of imported inputs and as destination market. By contrast South Africa connects more to&#13;
GVCs than to RVCs, and even Namibia has significantly greater links into GVCs and somewhat less reliance on&#13;
South Africa than does Swaziland. If this reliance on South Africa is a factor in Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s poor performance&#13;
in accruing productivity spillovers from GVCs, it would raise questions over the nature of technology and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            67&#13;
&amp;#12;learning coming through South African lead firms, and of the potential of RVCs to deliver significant&#13;
productivity spillovers to the region.&#13;
&#13;
Notably, in the rest of the country sample, the positive productivity gain is higher on the selling side (forward&#13;
links) than on the buying side (backward links). But in all three SACU countries, the productivity gains from&#13;
being a buyer in GVCs are relatively higher (and in the case of Swaziland absolutely higher). This implies that&#13;
access to technology and knowledge embodied in imported inputs matters more strongly to the SACU&#13;
countries and suggests that access to imported inputs is particularly important to firms in the SACU region.&#13;
&#13;

Note: p*&lt;0.1, p**&lt;0.05, p***&lt;0.01. The total impact of firm-level export and imported input share on labor productivity in a country&#13;
of interest is given by the sum of two coefficients: Î²1 + Î²2 in equation B8.2.1 (box 8.2).&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the results also show that firm differences matter for taking advantage of productivity spillovers from&#13;
GVC integration (table 8.2). In particular, two findings stand out:&#13;
     ï&#130;·     Firms with relatively higher productivity (a smaller gap with the â&#128;&#152;productivity frontierâ&#128;&#153;) and firms with&#13;
           a higher technology level benefit most: This suggests that the capacity of firms to absorb the potential&#13;
           productivity spillovers is critical. Across the sample we find that firms with the highest technology level&#13;
           (tech4) benefit most strongly, especially in Namibia. The differences for firms with lower technology&#13;
           levels, however, are ambiguous. In Namibia and Swaziland we find a U-shape effect on productivity.&#13;
           In Namibia, firms in the lowest category (tech1) show higher productivity effects from exporting than&#13;
           firms in the medium category, while in Swaziland such firms show lower productivity losses. In South&#13;
           Africa and the rest of the sample, by contrast, higher technology levels are associated with higher&#13;
           productivity. By contrast South African firms with low technology levels (tech1) see their productivity&#13;
           decline in the presence of GVC integration (at least initially33).&#13;
     ï&#130;·     For exporters, firms that have â&#128;&#152;medium integrationâ&#128;&#153; on the buying side benefit most : This seems to&#13;
           suggest an inverse U-shaped impact of import shareâ&#128;&#148;that is, firms that import little or nothing (very&#13;
           low GVC integration) and firms that import a very large share of inputs (perhaps indicating poor in-&#13;
           house capabilities) have weaker productivity gains.&#13;

&amp;#12;9. GVCs and Jobs&#13;
&#13;
    9.1. Introduction&#13;
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) countries are facing challenges in terms of joblessness and inequality.&#13;
Therefore, the relative attractiveness of global value chains (GVCs) will depend a lot on the number of jobs&#13;
that they bring as well as the nature of these jobs. GVCs are fundamentally about restructuring the locations of&#13;
economic activity: what used to be produced under one factory roof may now take place in four or five different&#13;
countries. This has fundamental impacts on where the jobs go, who gets them, and what types of jobs they are.&#13;
&#13;
At a macro level, GVCs generally involve a significant shift of jobs from developed to developing countries. This is&#13;
mainly because many of the low value, labor-intensive activities are shifting out to developing countries. But within&#13;
developing countries, for any given volume of output GVCs may actually result in fewer jobs, as less labor-intensive&#13;
methods of production may result. For example, the requirement for GVCs to meet strict quality standards often&#13;
leads to increased mechanization. And the scale economies possible from accessing larger global markets may make&#13;
capital investments more viable. Indeed, the relationship is clearly not a linear one and may not even be monotonic.&#13;
GVCs may also have distributional consequences in terms of the nature of skills demand and their implications for&#13;
wages.&#13;
&#13;
So clearly, the process of GVC integration will invariably result in winners and losers, both across countries and&#13;
within them, and it will often be difficult to predict ex ante how these things will take shape in any country. In this&#13;
chapter, we use the newly developed World Bank dataset on the labor content of exports (LACEX) and jobs&#13;
content of exports (JOCEX) to explore the possible implications of GVCs for jobs and wages in South Africa.34&#13;
&#13;
 Box 9.1: The Labor Content of Exports (LACEX) and Jobs Content of Exporters (JOCEX) datasets&#13;
 The LACEX dataset has been recently assembled to compute the (direct and indirect) value of the compensation of&#13;
 employees linked to exports for each sector/country/year (CalÃ¬ et al. 2015). The data has been computed on the basis&#13;
 of a panel of global input-output data spanning intermittent years from 1995 to 2007 from the Global Trade Analysis&#13;
 Project (GTAP). This represents a form of social accounting data â&#128;&#148;a variation on the social accounting matrix (SAM)&#13;
 where incomes are shown in the rows of the SAM while expenditures are shown in the columns (Hertel 2013;&#13;
 McDougal 2001).&#13;
&#13;
 The structure of the data provides a comprehensive and consistent record of national income accounting relationships&#13;
 between different sectors and regions, including intermediate and final demand linkages. This structure of the dataset&#13;
 allows one to obtain the value-added content of final output and exports, including its compensation of employeesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
 component. That includes both the direct and indirect compensation, based on the backward linkages of each sector&#13;
 with the rest of the economy. In order to obtain these measures of labor value added, two intermediate multiplier&#13;
 matrixes need to be calculated. The first is the Leontief inverse matrix, which measures the inputs contained in a unit&#13;
 of final output. This matrix contains both direct and indirect inputs. Next, one needs to calculate a matrix that has the&#13;
 compensation of employeesâ&#128;&#153; shares of total output. Using these two matrixes as multiplier s one can obtain the&#13;
 compensation of employeesâ&#128;&#153; shares of exports and final outputs. These shares are also split between skilled and&#13;
 unskilled workers.&#13;
&#13;
 The data are then matched with the UNIDO industrial statistics, which contains data for a number of countries,&#13;
 including South Africa, on employment at the 4-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) sector. This&#13;
 allows isolating the jobs (JOCEX) component of LACEX.&#13;
&#13;
 Note: For more details on the methodology used to construct the LACEX database, please see the background working paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    9.2. Exports and jobs in South Africa&#13;
Before turning to GVCs specifically it is worth first looking briefly at the relationship between jobs and exports&#13;
more generally. Several findings stand out. First, the data shows that in South Africa the labor value added&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            70&#13;
&amp;#12;directly contained in exports (that is, the wages paid to produce the exports) has been increasing robustly&#13;
since 2001â&#128;&#148;growth over the decade was 7.7 percent annually in nominal terms. But relative to the value of&#13;
gross exports, the labor share is in fairly sharp decline. In 2001 each US$100 of exports generated US$41 of&#13;
domestic wages, while by 2011 this figure had fallen to US$33â&#128;&#148;of which just US$14.5 comes directly in the&#13;
export sectors, with the rest coming through backward links to the domestic economy. This US$33 of wages&#13;
is well below that of China and Brazil and it is in line with India (which has followed a similar trajectory to that&#13;
of South Africa). The only BRICS country with a share below that of South Africa is the Russian Federation.&#13;
&#13;
Not only has the labor contained in exports been declining relative to gross exports, but it has also declined&#13;
relative to the total domestic labor value added. This trend has translated into a reduction of the jobs&#13;
contained in exports (figure 9.1). South Africa moved from having 22 jobs per US$ million in exports in 2004&#13;
to around 17 in 2011. While this is a sizable reduction, it is less dramatic than most other comparator countries.&#13;
This generalized decrease in the number of jobs in exports is consistent with labor-saving technological&#13;
changes across developing countries. Despite this smaller drop in jobs content, South Africa remains one of&#13;
the middle-income countries in the sample with the lowest number of jobs associated with exports. That is&#13;
partly a composition effect as South African exports are dominated by capital-intensive mining sector. But it&#13;
also reflects the often-cited tendency of South African businesses to choose investments in capital over labor,&#13;
as a result of relatively high wages, low productivity, and burdensome regulatory environment.&#13;

A second important finding is that manufacturing matters for jobs, but its importance comes mainly through&#13;
its backward links to the domestic economy (figure 9.2). The indirect employment impact of manufacturing&#13;
exports (jobs in industries providing inputs into manufacturing exports) is nearly 4.5 times greater than the&#13;
direct manufacturing employment. Indeed, while the minerals sector generates the most direct jobs, due to&#13;
its dominance in the export basket and relative labor intensity, its weak backward links with the domestic&#13;
economy limits its overall employment impact.&#13;
&#13;
Services sectors, while being relatively small contributors to the direct labor content of exports, are the most&#13;
important contributor of labor to exports when accounting also for the forward linkages. Trade and transport&#13;
services as well as other private services have large wage bills servicing export sectors. On the other hand labor&#13;
in the minerals and metals sectors are hardly employed to produce inputs for other exporting sectors,&#13;
indicating very limited downstream connectivity with the rest of the economy. Perhaps surprisingly, while the&#13;
machinery and equipment sector has a large labor content in exports, it is also not involved in the production&#13;
to supply other exporting sectors. Overall, this shows a picture of a manufacturing sector with strong backward&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 71&#13;
&amp;#12;linkages in the domestic economy, particularly through services, but very weak forward linkages. Thus,&#13;
domestic value chains appear to be relatively short.&#13;

&amp;#12;    9.3. The impact of GVCs on jobs in South Africaâ&#128;&#148;automotive case example&#13;
Turning from the domestic value chain to the global one, we ask how GVC integration impacts the level and&#13;
nature of jobs in South Africa. To understand this we focus on the automotive sector, where South Africa&#13;
became deeply integrated over the past decade,35 in significant part due to support from the Motor Industry&#13;
Development Programme and, more recently, the Automotive Production and Development Programme. Key&#13;
results are summarized in figures 9.4 and 9.5. The first thing to note is that rapid growth of exports resulting&#13;
from GVC integration meant that jobs in the sector increased substantially over the decade â&#128;&#148;so GVC&#13;
integration clearly delivered more jobs to the South African automotive sector. On the other hand, the relative&#13;
labor intensity of automotive exports declined sharply. While automotive exports contributed around US$37&#13;
of labor per US$100 of exports in 2001, this declined to below US$30 in 2011. This figure is well below that of&#13;
Brazil, China (where the labor content has increased), and India (where it has remained stable). South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
decline in labor intensity is explained almost fully by declining labor content in direct manufacturing (figure&#13;
9.4). In fact, the labor content of direct manufacturing jobs almost halved over the decade.&#13;
&#13;
Despite this, significant growth in jobs occurred as a result of the automotive sectorâ&#128;&#153;s extensive backward links&#13;
to the domestic economy. While each direct job in the automotive sector was linked with one indirect job in&#13;
2001, by 2013 each direct job was linked with three indirect jobs. Most importantly, this came through services&#13;
sector links. This is not a surprising finding; in fact, it is exactly what we might expect to happen in an&#13;
environment of GVC integration. Exports make increasing use of foreign inputs (reducing direct labor demand)&#13;
but coordinating these inputs requires more intensive use of (mainly domestic) services, including financial&#13;
services, transport and logistics, and other business services.&#13;
&#13;
GVC integration also appears to have significant implications on skills demand. Figure 9.5 shows that for direct&#13;
jobs in the automotive sector, the contribution of unskilled labor per US$100 of exports has declined&#13;
significantly over the decade, while that of skilled labor has remained steady. This is, again, perhaps to be&#13;
expected in the context of GVC integration, where the requirements for productivity, quality, and consistency&#13;
from global lead firms likely contributes to increased capital intensity and demands for higher skills. The strong&#13;
shift toward indirect, services employment, which tends to have a higher skills bias, may have significant&#13;
implications for the demand for skilled versus unskilled labor. These findings suggest that GVC integration is&#13;
likely to have distributional consequences, through the acceleration of the underlying skills bias that is already&#13;
prevalent in South African production.&#13;

&amp;#12;10.     Conclusions: How Should We Think about â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;?&#13;
&#13;
    10.1. Introduction&#13;
The previous chapters provided an eclectic review of global value chains (GVCs) and regional value chains&#13;
(RVCs), covering various aspects relating to their development and implications both at a global level and&#13;
specifically for Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) countries. What is clear is that globalization has&#13;
changed the landscape for trade and investment. And while the 2008 â&#128;&#147;09 global economic crisis and 2011&#13;
natural disasters (a tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand) may have caused slight corrections in the spread&#13;
of global production networks, their trajectory remains unaltered. Thus for SACU countries, like all countries,&#13;
the question is not â&#128;&#152;ifâ&#128;&#153; to join GVCs but how get the most out of them in terms of ex ports, productivity, and&#13;
jobs. This chapter aims to pull together some of the main findings from the previous chapters and suggest a&#13;
way for the region to think about developing a realistic version of â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; that can deliver&#13;
value for all countries in the region.&#13;
&#13;
    10.2. How should SACU countries think about GVCs?â&#128;&#148;emerging findings&#13;
As a starting point, six broad messages emerge from these findings that should be at the forefront of how&#13;
policy makers approach GVCs:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Productivity and job creation are the motivators for GVC integration&#13;
The findings presented in this report indicate that firms that are integrated into GVCs tend to be more&#13;
productive than those that are not. Thus, facilitating the growth of GVCs and the reallocation of resources&#13;
toward GVC-integrated firms should increase efficiency and aggregate productivity in the economy. The&#13;
findings also suggest that GVCs can have important job-generating impacts, although these mainly come&#13;
through linkages with associated services sectors rather than directly in the core manufacturing or agricultural&#13;
value chain activities. Further research is needed to find conclusive evidence on both of these, but they&#13;
provide a normative anchor for thinking about GVCs as a policy choice in the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Foreign and domestic value added are complements, not a substitutes&#13;
The standard way of measuring GVC participation is by assessing the amount of foreign value added embodied&#13;
in domestic exports. Ironically, at the same time, most governments have an objective (at least implicitly) of&#13;
maximizing domestic value added (DVA). Maximizing DVA is indeed the appropriate objective over the long&#13;
term; the question, of course, is where the right balance is in the shorter term (box 10.1). This will depend on&#13;
the sector, and it will also depend on the size and capabilities of the country in question. DVA in GVC-oriented&#13;
manufacturing sectors will almost always be higher in South Africa than it will be in Botswana, Lesotho,&#13;
Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS). This is where timing and government policy come in. Increasing value added&#13;
can be achieved in two main ways: (i) by participating in higher value-added segments of value chains, and (ii)&#13;
by participating in more segments of the value chain. The former requires policies to support upgrading; the&#13;
latter requires policies to support â&#128;&#152;densificationâ&#128;&#153; of supply chains (that is, having more quality domestic&#13;
suppliers). This will be discussed in more detail in chapter 11.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously strategies to support upgrading and densification, even if implemented effectively, take time to&#13;
bear fruit. So raising DVA should be thought of as a process (in each sector), which should be sustained over&#13;
a decade or more. And getting the balance and timing right is important; the global lead firms governing these&#13;
GVCs as well as the firms carrying out the specific tasks in the country at hand must be in a position to operate&#13;
in the most competitive environment possible, without any restrictions on working with their suppliers of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              76&#13;
&amp;#12;choice from anywhere in the world, or on the tasks that they have identified as the most appropriate for the&#13;
location.&#13;
&#13;
 Box 10.1: Domestic and foreign value added: substitutes or complements?&#13;
 Operating in global value chains (GVCs) is fundamentally about global trade integration. This means not only exporting&#13;
 within production chains but also making use of imported parts and components. Thus, while nominal domestic value&#13;
 added (DVA) is ultimately the measure of aggregate success for any country, the level of foreign value added (FVA)&#13;
 embodied in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports is an important measure of GVC integration.&#13;
&#13;
 Mathematically, in percentage terms, DVA and FVA are substitutes. If a country increases its FVA from 40 percent to&#13;
 50 percent of exports that necessarily means that DVA has declined from 60 percent to 50 percent. But that does not&#13;
 mean that maximizing DVA share should be the goal, particularly if it achieved through an import substitution strategy&#13;
 that results in producers having to accept lower-quality or higher-priced inputs (or simply inputs that are incompatible&#13;
 with those required by GVC-oriented buyers). In this case, maximizing DVA share comes at the expense of total&#13;
 volumes, as domestic producers may experience declining competitiveness in global markets and may be unable to&#13;
 participate in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
 Balance is important; few would argue that having 99 percent DVA is a competitive position for a country to be in.&#13;
 Essentially this would mean that firms in the country are operating completely outside of GVCs. At the national level,&#13;
 this would almost certainly mean that exports and investment are below their potential. At the firm and national&#13;
 level, in a dynamic context, the failure to access global technologies for exports would likely have implications for&#13;
 productivity growth, and, therefore, for competitiveness over time. Similarly, few would argue that having 99 percent&#13;
 FVA is a competitive position to be in. This scenario would indicate extremely high GVC participation â&#128;&#148;but with&#13;
 virtually no DVA, being in a GVC would have nothing to offer.&#13;
&#13;
 From a dynamic perspective, therefore, DVA and FVA can be seen as complements. Access to quality- and cost-&#13;
 effective imported inputs raises firm competitiveness, resulting in higher exports and therefore higher nominal DVA.&#13;
 Over time, technology spillovers from imported inputs may also result in some goods and services becoming&#13;
 competitively produced in domestic markets, leading to a productive substitution of imported for domestic supply,&#13;
 and potentially even higher DVA share.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interdependence of products and servicesâ&#128;&#148;beyond â&#128;&#152;Factoryâ&#128;&#153; Southern Africa&#13;
Policy makers in the region (and globally) tend to look at GVC participation as part of a strategy to support&#13;
industrialization, or to support the commercialization and development of the agricultural sector, by linking&#13;
domestic firms into global markets. While products are at the heart of GVCs, efforts to join and upgrade in&#13;
GVCs will fail without policies to facilitate the development of competitive domestic and regional services&#13;
sectors. As this report highlighted, access to transport and producer servicesâ&#128;&#148;financial services, engineering&#13;
and design, and information and communication technology (ICT), among othersâ&#128;&#148;is increasingly fundamental&#13;
to the development of GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
This report also discussed a number of wider implications of GVCs on the trade and investment environment&#13;
that countries face, as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interdependence of firms and countriesâ&#128;&#148;the importance of external cooperation&#13;
Firms in a production chain require access to low-cost, high-quality inputs from all over the world. In other&#13;
words, being a competitive exporter is partly dependent on access to competitive imports. It also requires&#13;
speed, predictability, and flexibility, which highlights the critical importance of the trade facilitation&#13;
environment. Thus, traditional mercantilist approaches to trade policy are increasingly irrelevant (and, in fact,&#13;
counterproductive) in a GVC world. Instead, external cooperation, through the establishment and effective&#13;
implementation of deep trade and investment agreements, is increasingly critical. Interdependence in GVCs&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                        77&#13;
&amp;#12;also goes beyond trade policy and includes a greater need for deep knowledge of destination and source&#13;
markets in terms of quality, cost, reliability, and standards, and lead times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Integration of the trade and investment agendaâ&#128;&#148;the importance of internal coordination&#13;
In a GVC context, exporters are increasingly subsidiaries of foreign investors, which establish global production&#13;
networks and carry out intrafirm trade; or they are globally specialized subcontractors that establish branch&#13;
operations in specific countries based around the global production strategies of lead firms. For smaller&#13;
countries with limited domestic markets (that is, BLNS), foreign direct investment (FDI) outside of natural&#13;
resources and local services will almost exclusively be export oriented. Promoting exports and attracting FDI&#13;
have become two sides of the same coin. This has implications for the coordination of trade and investment&#13;
policy, but also for regulatory policies in the domestic environment, which cover the services sector, contracts&#13;
law, and intellectual property protection, to name but a few.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Increased power of multinationals and private standardsâ&#128;&#148;the importance of territorialization&#13;
strategies and a flexible regulatory environment&#13;
The power of MNCs is clearly increased in a GVC world, as decisions they take on how to structure production&#13;
networks has significant implications on local economies. Moreover, where production is designed for export&#13;
and relies significantly on imported inputs, the MNC location decisions become increasingly de-territorialized.&#13;
This obviously raises risks for countries attracting GVC investment, which requires concerted strategies&#13;
designed to increase domestic ties of MNCs. A second issue that arises with the growing power of&#13;
multinationals is the emergence of private, often global, standards, including product and distribution&#13;
standards (quality, sanitary and phytosanitary [SPS], and others) as well as labor, social, and environmental&#13;
ones. The growing importance of these private standards is driving a greater wedge between private sector&#13;
operations and regulatory practices both at and behind borders (see box 7.1). Adopting flexible regulatory&#13;
regimes based on principles of equivalence would help facilitate value chain trade.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, it is important to emphasize that all of these principles are as valid for RVCs as they are for GVCs. From&#13;
the investor and production/supply chain perspective, value chains operate with the same principles, whether&#13;
they involve regional or global markets.&#13;
&#13;
    10.3. SACUâ&#128;&#153;s positioning in GVCs and RVCs&#13;
The report documents a mixed picture of GVC integration and positioning among SACU countries. Overall, the&#13;
region is relatively well integrated in global trade, but the nature of trade is biased toward sectors that tend&#13;
not to be traded in vertically specialized GVCsâ&#128;&#148;mainly natural resource commodities. The story is somewhat&#13;
different at the regional level, where intraregional trade relationships are growing strongly. The sectors&#13;
involved in regional trade tend to lend themselves much more to vertically fragmented production. That said,&#13;
a more detailed product-level assessment finds that most trade in the region remains end-product oriented,&#13;
with relatively limited value chain trade happening in practice.&#13;
&#13;
Quantitative indices of GVC participation show the region has moderate GVC participation. But this masks very&#13;
different situations in each country:&#13;
    ï&#130;·   South Africa: GVC participation in aggregate is moderate; but much of what is driving the quantitative&#13;
        measure is commodity exports, which are being integrated into other countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports. While this is&#13;
        GVC participation, the nature of this type of trade offers limited potential to benefit from productivity&#13;
        spillover potential in GVCs (as opposed to exports of differentiated products that feed into lead-firm&#13;
        production networks). The other notable finding about South Africa is the fact that its FVA (backward&#13;
                                                                                                                78&#13;
&amp;#12;       integration) is dramatically below the global average in all sectors but automotiveâ&#128;&#148;in most sectors it&#13;
       is less than half, often closer to one-third, the global average. On the other hand, the backward&#13;
       integration that South Africa has developed is relatively high technology in nature and appears to be&#13;
       delivering significant benefits in terms of productivity. At the sectoral level, South Africa clearly has&#13;
       participation in a number of GVC sectors, with automotive standing out as one where the country has&#13;
       a particularly well-established position. On the other hand, its positioning is marginal in other key GVC&#13;
       sectors like apparel and electronics. In all cases, GVC exports are concentrated in end products rather&#13;
       than intermediates.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Lesotho: Over the decade, Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s growth in GVC participation has been among the most rapid in&#13;
       the world. This is explained by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s integration in the global apparel GVC (and, increasingly,&#13;
       the regional apparel production network). While Lesotho has benefited enormously from this in terms&#13;
       of investment, exports, and employment, it has struggled to move beyond its low-level positioning in&#13;
       the value chain; DVA remains relatively low and not growing as a share of exports.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Swaziland: Apparel exports have also contributed to Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s increasing integration into GVCs,&#13;
       although its level of forward integration is limited (like Lesotho, its apparel exports are all end&#13;
       products). Backward integration appears to be benefiting from access to imported inputs from high&#13;
       technology sectors, yet evidence suggests little to no productivity spillovers resulting from this. Given&#13;
       the strong productivity effects from imports found in South Africa and Namibia, this finding is&#13;
       surprising and suggests barriers to absorption of technology in Swaziland or other barriers that&#13;
       mediate the productivity effect.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Namibia: With specialization in commodities, Namibiaâ&#128;&#153;s GVC participation comes mainly through the&#13;
       import channel. While participation levels are moderate, as noted above Namibia appears to be&#13;
       benefiting from positive productivity effects.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Botswana: Of all countries in the region, Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s GVC performance appears particularly poor.&#13;
       Overall levels of GVC participation are relatively high, but this is driven significantly by commodity&#13;
       exports, with limited spillover potential (as discussed above). Most importantly, growth in DVA has&#13;
       been very lowâ&#128;&#148;by far the lowest in the region. This is driven by weak performance in manufacturing&#13;
       and agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
Following are some of the key findings on GVC and RVC integration across the SACU region:&#13;
   ï&#130;·   The region as a whole faces challenges of distance: Large distances from the main global markets limit&#13;
       value chain participation and contribute to the low-level positioning in the region. Even South Africa&#13;
       faces considerable competitiveness challenges due to do distance, which impacts both costs and,&#13;
       critically, time/flexibility. Even within South Africa, sectors like automotive are relatively dispersed&#13;
       geographically, limiting the potential benefits of clusters and raising transport and logistics costs.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Within the region, scale is a challenge to both GVC and RVC participation, and compounds existing&#13;
       geographical and climatic constraints: BLNS countries, each with populations around 2 million, face&#13;
       major scale challenges to competing in GVCs and even RVCs. These challenges not only affect the size&#13;
       of the manufacturing sector/cluster that can develop but, perhaps more critically, impact access to&#13;
       industry-specific technical skills and support services that are critical to building a competitive cluster&#13;
       (see below). These scale challenges are compounded, in agricultural sectors, by agriclimatic&#13;
       conditions that limit severely the scope and competitiveness of BLNS countries in most agricultural&#13;
       sectors.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   The scale challenge at the regional level is compounded by huge intraregional imbalances as well as&#13;
       path dependence, which favors industry location in South Africa : In terms of developing intraregional&#13;
       value chains, the scale challenges of BLNS are compounded by the fact that South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s economy&#13;
       thoroughly dominates the region. With more than 90 percent of regional GDP (and a dominant share&#13;
                                                                                                          79&#13;
&amp;#12;        of markets well beyond SACU), South Africa is not only the best location to ensure production scale&#13;
        but more importantly it is the obvious place to be for proximity to markets. This is compounded&#13;
        further by the fact that distribution and marketing arrangements tend to already be well-established&#13;
        in South African markets. Therefore, integrating value chain steps in BLNS markets often requires an&#13;
        active shift in strategic approach and potentially establishing entirely new supply chains. Justifying&#13;
        such a move when the vast majority of inputs come from South Africa and 90â&#128;&#147;95 percent of the end&#13;
        market is in South Africa remains a daunting challenge.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Productivity and supply chain weaknesses undermine the potential of BLNS to leverage resource and&#13;
        wage advantages: Opportunities do exist to leverage the comparative advantages of BLNS in a&#13;
        â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; model, both in terms of accessing low-wage labor (in highly labor-intensive&#13;
        activities where the economics of production justify incurring higher transport costs) and accessing&#13;
        specific inputs (agricultural and minerals). At the moment, however, BLNS countries face weaknesses&#13;
        in productivity and high transport and logistics costs that undermine this potential.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Trade policy aggravates the problem and undermines potential for downstream value chain&#13;
        development within the region: And potential for downstream processing, which is most relevant in&#13;
        agroprocessing, is constrained by a restrictive trade policy environment that undermines downstream&#13;
        competitiveness in an attempt to protect upstream markets. This can be seen in the intra-SACU trade&#13;
        restrictions on grain and feed, dairy, and poultry, among others.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Services are critical as exports in their own right and as inputs to competitive value chains: SACUâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        tourism sectors are already operating in fairly integrated RVCs (although many barriers still constrain&#13;
        full exploitation of cross-border synergies). Development of this value chain also has significant&#13;
        potential to support downstream value added in sectors like jewelry (diamonds, precious metals),&#13;
        crafts, and others. Across all countries in the region, services sectors make the biggest contribution&#13;
        to DVA in GVC sectors. And while services are relatively openly traded within SACU, barriers to cross-&#13;
        border services trade represent a significant constraint to the development of RVCs stretching outside&#13;
        of SACU and into the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and beyond.&#13;
&#13;
    10.4. What might a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; look like in practice?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; and its potential&#13;
At the start of this report, the concept of â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; was introduced, and an assessment of the&#13;
potential for its development in the region was established as one of the main objectives of this report. The&#13;
concept of â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; is based around the experiences of Asia, East later followed by Central&#13;
and Eastern Europe in â&#128;&#152;Factory Europeâ&#128;&#153; and, in a more narrow form, Mexico and Central America in â&#128;&#152;Factory&#13;
Americaâ&#128;&#153;. In all cases, these were integrated regional production networks (in the Asian case, eventually&#13;
global) where lead firms from the most advanced economy in the region developed offshore production&#13;
networks. In this â&#128;&#152;flying geeseâ&#128;&#153; model, RVC integration was a process by which exploitation of comparative&#13;
advantage delivered global competitiveness to lead firms. This model benefited both investing and host&#13;
countries and, critically, where capabilities were built step-by-step, allowed for technological upgrading to&#13;
take place across the region.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the assessment presented in this report, how realistic is it for SACU countries to replicate such a&#13;
model in Southern Africa? The findings in chapter 4 are positive in this respect. They show that South Africa&#13;
compares reasonably well to ASEAN countries in terms of its capabilities for the production of GVC&#13;
intermediates, and that South Africa and BLNS countries show very strong complementarities in their&#13;
capability mix. Probably the biggest constraints facing the region are structuralâ&#128;&#148;including scale and distance&#13;
from markets. Population in the region is more than 30 times smaller than in East Asia. Thus, with a limited&#13;
labor pool and relatively small regional markets, production tends to operate at relatively low volumes, making&#13;
                                                                                                             80&#13;
&amp;#12;it difficult for firms and sectors to leverage scale economies for productivity gains. This contributes to a&#13;
situation where the manufacturing sectorâ&#128;&#148;which is at the heart of the flying geese patternâ&#128;&#148;tends to be&#13;
relatively undeveloped and uncompetitive (in a global context) in the region. And large distances to global&#13;
markets mean that while the SACU may be able to compete in standardized, lower-value tasks, the region will&#13;
have a more difficult time upgrading into tasks that require globally leading knowledge,36 coordination, and&#13;
tacit knowledge exchange. The issue of scale also aggravates what is already a weakness in the regionâ&#128;&#148;human&#13;
capital. Here, the region fares relatively poorly in global comparisons. Again, while this may not be a binding&#13;
constraint for GVC participation at the low end of the value chain, enhancement of human resources is the&#13;
key institutional prerequisite for value chain upgrading.&#13;
&#13;
South Africa is undoubtedly, and by a large measure, the leading economy in Southern Africa and the one in&#13;
the region with the most potential to drive a flying geese pattern of industrialization. It is rightly considered&#13;
the growth pole of the region owing to its relative economic weight and sophisticated corporate capabilities,&#13;
as reflected in its regional FDI and trade footprints. Its companies are significant investors in the BLNS&#13;
economies, and beyond in Southern Africa, in a range of sectors from natural resources extraction, through&#13;
basic industries and utilities, to manufacturing and services (Page &amp; te Velde 2004; Draper et al. 2010). Only&#13;
South African companies have the potential to drive RVCs in these sectors; other countries in Southern Africa&#13;
such as Angola, Botswana, or Zambia have infrastructure and capacity primarily for extracting natural&#13;
resources (Ogunleye 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Of course, South Africa of 2015 differs significantly from Japan of the 1960s in a number of areas, including&#13;
relative economic scale, labor force size and skills, and fundamentally different domestic political economies&#13;
and associated constraints. South Africa cannot emulate Japan in terms of scale of FDI, or size and&#13;
sophistication of home firms. The Japanese outward FDI footprint was large, comprehensive, and powerful.&#13;
South Africa lacks the necessary economic, political, and technological capacities to copy it. Moreover, the&#13;
demographic structure in East Asia supported the flying geese pattern: Japanâ&#128;&#153;s population is aging and costly&#13;
to maintain, which encourages relocation of low value-added, labor-intensive operations to lower-income,&#13;
labor-abundant neighboring countries. However, South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s population is young, and the country&#13;
continues to deal with extremely high levels of structural unemployment, particularly among youth,&#13;
underscoring the socioeconomic and political imperative of investing at home.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, relying on larger MNCs from outside the region would be critical to a successful â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;. In this regard, while Western MNCs are of importance in a number of sectors, they have been a&#13;
declining force in the region, with China expected to become the leading investor in building Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
manufacturing base (Ozawa and Bellak 2011). Relying on China, however, may neither deliver the quality nor&#13;
the quantity of investment needed. Therefore, a combination of investors from different home countries is&#13;
required. Rather than a single, dominant South African flock, a multitude of smaller flocks is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#152;gatewayâ&#128;&#153; model&#13;
But why would MNCs from outside the SACU region want to engage in FDI there? To answer this question we&#13;
turn now to the â&#128;&#152;gateway modelâ&#128;&#153;. Under this model, South Africa, and indeed the wider SACU region, serves&#13;
as a gateway for a much wider production region, encompassing present-day SADC and potentially up through&#13;
the area now defined under the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement (TFTA).&#13;
&#13;
For SACU, the gateway model suggests that even if the immediate region is not always ideal for GVC-oriented&#13;
production, the region may still integrate with GVCs as the host of â&#128;&#152;command-controlâ&#128;&#153; and facilitating&#13;
(services) functions of global supply networks. Gateways are hinges between the regional and the global level.&#13;
They open their hinterland to external influencesâ&#128;&#148;goods, services, people, and ideasâ&#128;&#148;and possess a nodal&#13;
                                                                                                           81&#13;
&amp;#12;function. Regional clustering occurs around them. In other words, the notion of South Africa being a gateway&#13;
complements the flying geese model because it plugs RVCs into GVCs, or at least has the potential to do so.&#13;
Key components of a gateway are, therefore, transport infrastructure and advanced producer services, such&#13;
as banking and consultancy, which enable MNCs to coordinate their networks.&#13;
&#13;
SACU is very well positioned as a gateway region, linking the region to MNC â&#128;&#152;geeseâ&#128;&#153;. South Afri ca already&#13;
operates as the trade and transport gateway for the region, much like China did in the 1990s for East Asian&#13;
economies. And the development of Namibia as a logistics hub (leveraging Walvis Bay and the Trans-Kalahari&#13;
and Trans-Caprivi Corridors) brings still more depth and flexibility to the regionâ&#128;&#153;s offering. South Africa hosts&#13;
global cities with internationalized business environments, and has a growing services sector (including&#13;
finance, engineering and business services, and design); this can be complemented by the ongoing&#13;
developments of Botswana as a leading services and business hub in the region. Reinforcing these strengths&#13;
can yield substantial regional benefits. South Africa, in particular, can facilitate intensified FDI and associated&#13;
investment flows throughout the region. Spillover effects from service support functions can create&#13;
opportunities for South Africa and BLNS countries to host headquarter, back office, and logistics activities.&#13;
BLNS countries could be well placed to leverage the gateway by plugging into GVCs in agriculture,&#13;
manufacturing, and services, and over time upgrading within them.&#13;
&#13;
However, a number of challenges inhibit the potential of this gateway approach. Internationally, South Africa&#13;
struggles to attract MNC headquarters, with increasing competition from offshore locations (such as Dubai&#13;
and Mauritius). Geographically it lacks trading centrality from a global perspective. Inefficient borders increase&#13;
transport costs and high tariff and nontariff barriers raise costs for GVC-oriented producers. Domestically,&#13;
South Africa (and indeed all of SACU) is limited by high wages, a lack of skilled labor, and an insufficiently&#13;
competitive knowledge infrastructure. And recent policies toward foreign investors37 could inhibit the&#13;
realization of these aims.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, South Africa lacks a comprehensive â&#128;&#152;gateway strategyâ&#128;&#153;. Investment in as well as access and pricing of&#13;
key trade infrastructure is highly geared toward extractive exports at the expense of supporting a gateway&#13;
strategy. Furthermore, state-owned transport companies hold a dominant position in shaping both market&#13;
competition and policy direction.&#13;
&#13;
Chapter 11 will outline some of the policies needed to support a gateway strategy, as well as more broadly to&#13;
strengthen RVCs and position SACU countries to take advantage of their productivity and jobs spillovers&#13;
potential.&#13;

&amp;#12;11.     Policies for Value Chain Integration in SACU&#13;
&#13;
    11.1. Introduction&#13;
Drawing on the materials presented throughout this report, and in particular on the conclusions in chapter&#13;
10, this chapter outlines some policy considerations for Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) countries to&#13;
consider to strengthen competitiveness in value chains. It covers two main areas. First, we outline policies to&#13;
support the development of â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;, in particular developing the gateway model. Second,&#13;
we discuss areas of policy that would support strengthened positioning in value chains.&#13;
&#13;
    11.2. Policies to support a gateway model for â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
In order to mobilize competitive factors of production located in the Southern African periphery into global&#13;
value chains (GVCs), the region needs a gateway that provides and manages transport infrastructure and can&#13;
coordinate the management of value chains. The realization of value addition within the region, therefore,&#13;
depends on combining South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s globally competitive and technologically sophisticated enterprises with&#13;
foreign MNCs, supported by effective regional integration. In effect, the practical vision for a â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153; hinges not around factories at all, but around leveraging competitive transport and producer services .&#13;
&#13;
Below we outline a three-plank framework for supporting â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153;:&#13;
    1. Facilitating regional economic densification&#13;
    2. Skills, services, and infrastructure for productivity&#13;
    3. Promoting open regionalism and institutional coordination&#13;
&#13;
1. Facilitating regional economic densification&#13;
As discussed throughout this report, the region faces significant structural challenges both in connecting to&#13;
GVCs and in building RVCs, including those of distance, scale, and asymmetry. Adopting an economic&#13;
geography framework (World Bank 2008), policy makers across SACU should focus on facilitating economic&#13;
density in the region by reducing distance and division. This will encourage industry concentration in the region&#13;
and promote value chain integration. Such an approach is multi-scalar in natureâ&#128;&#148;it requires supportive&#13;
actions at the urban, national, and regional scale. It also requires a coordinated institutional context (see plank&#13;
3) and a political economy that accepts the reality that economic activity will not spread evenly across&#13;
countries and that no sectors or value chain activities can be effectively reserved for any individual country.&#13;
Key elements include:&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Improving trade and transport infrastructure and adopting an explicit gateway strategy: As discussed&#13;
        in this report, transport infrastructure in the SACU region is generally competitive, both in its coverage&#13;
        and quality. This is particularly the case along the main transport corridors that carry most of the&#13;
        export traffic. There are, however, some shortfalls that need to be addressed to support regional&#13;
        value chains (RVCs) and promote the competitiveness of noncommodity exports. While South Africa&#13;
        has a major infrastructure build program in place, the freight infrastructure remains biased toward&#13;
        extractives in both rail and ports. Meanwhile, nontraditional exporters and smaller exporters face&#13;
        increasing barriers of access, price, and reliability on the rail and ports infrastructure. Moreover, port&#13;
        congestion raises risks for South Africa to maintain its gateway status, in the context of many new&#13;
        port projects throughout the continent. In addition to improving access, pricing, and efficiency of the&#13;
        port and rail system, further efforts to promote coordination of SACU ports and trade corridors will&#13;
        be critical to support RVCs. Land border crossings between SACU and the Southern African&#13;
        Development Community (SADC) require continued attention to upgrade processes and&#13;
        infrastructure, and extending border hours should be part of strengthening the gateway. Improving&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                83&#13;
&amp;#12;    intermodal coordination within and across countries is also critical to improving the efficiency of&#13;
    freight transport in the region. Finally, there is a need, both in South Africa and at the SACU level, to&#13;
    develop a coherent gateway strategy. An explicit strategy might result in a rethink of existing&#13;
    government approaches to the role of state-owned transport enterprises. For example, in order to&#13;
    maximize regional and global connectivity, a gateway strategy might require a change in thinking&#13;
    about the role and structure of Transnet, or of policies toward allocation of slots at O.R. Tambo&#13;
    International Airport, as well as the wider strategy of the national airports network and of South&#13;
    African Airways&#13;
ï&#130;·   Reducing barriers to cross-border trade, including trade policy harmonization of noncustoms border&#13;
    agency activities in SACU, and at SACU-SADC borders: As discussed in detail in chapters 7 and 8, tariff&#13;
    and especially nontariff barriers remain significant restrictions to the emergence of integrated RVCs,&#13;
    hampering interaction between the gateway and its periphery. The biggest barriers occur between&#13;
    the SACU region and Southern Africa. For example, while Botswana and Namibia possess one-stop&#13;
    border posts that take 20 minutes for lorries, transport from Windhoek to Lubango in southern Angola&#13;
    can take up to 15 days. Similarly, delays at Beitbridge on the border of South Africa and Zimbabwe&#13;
    were on average 34 hours for traffic northwards and 11 hours for traffic southwards. At Chirundu on&#13;
    Zimbabweâ&#128;&#153;s border with Zambia, lorries waited another 39 hours if they went north and 11 hours if&#13;
    southbound. Border delays continue to decline, but significant progress has not materialized, mostly&#13;
    owing to bureaucratic obstacles and problems in applying technologically sophisticated procedures&#13;
    at borders. And while customs issues are relatively under control within SACU, nontariff barriers are&#13;
    a significant concern, with quality, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS), and other standards often applied&#13;
    arbitrarily. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS) in SACU regularly invoke the 2002&#13;
    agreementâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;infant industryâ&#128;&#153; clause to erect internal trade barriers to exports from other SACU states&#13;
    (but principally South Africa) and impose a wide variety of import bans on agricultural and&#13;
    agroprocessed goods from South Africa. For their part, South African customs officials reportedly&#13;
    regularly interdict goods moving across the BLNS countriesâ&#128;&#153; borders into South Africa. Large&#13;
    multinationals tend to find ways around many of these barriers (or absorb their costs), but they are&#13;
    particularly hard on smaller firms, which are key to RVC development. Efforts to address these barriers&#13;
    should focus on:&#13;
        ï&#130;·   replicating the success of customs modernization to non-customs border operations&#13;
        ï&#130;·   putting in place a variety of mechanisms to facilitate cross-border processes for smaller&#13;
            shippers; this could include, for example, alleviating the cashflow implications of&#13;
            nonharmonized VAT, which is estimated to cost 2 percent of the value of transactions for&#13;
            intra-SACU movements&#13;
        ï&#130;·   eliminating, reducing, and/or harmonizing behind-the-border barriers such as licensing and&#13;
            labelling requirements&#13;
    Detailed provisions on this policy agenda are set out in a recent assessment (World Bank/SACU 2014).&#13;
ï&#130;·   Promoting factor mobility by liberalizing work permits and movement of persons and promoting&#13;
    deeper cross-border trade in services: Enabling businesses to operate seamlessly across SACU borders,&#13;
    and to coordinate wider regional and global activities from anywhere in the region, will be critical to&#13;
    the competitiveness of the region as a gateway for GVC investment. In this context, the region is&#13;
    relatively open for capital mobility and for foreign investment. However, two aspects require some&#13;
    attention. First, openness to foreign skilled workers is necessary, as elaborated on in the discussion&#13;
    of skills below. But it is clear that all countries in the region, particularly Botswana, Namibia, and South&#13;
    Africa, have become increasingly restrictive in the issuance of work permits for skilled workers and&#13;
    managers (and even owners) over recent years. Indeed, in Botswana this issue has been consistently&#13;
    identified in recent years as the biggest barrier to foreign investment in the country. Somewhat&#13;
                                                                                                             84&#13;
&amp;#12;        related is the need to increase openness in cross-border trade in services, in particular presence of&#13;
        â&#128;&#152;natural personsâ&#128;&#153; (Mode 4).&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Promoting agglomeration through urban infrastructure and services, and promotion of clusters and&#13;
        special economic zones (SEZs): Support for regional clustering of value chains will be important to&#13;
        promote the scale (internal and external) needed for competitiveness. At a conceptual level this&#13;
        requires a somewhat different approach to promoting RVCsâ&#128;&#148;one that shifts from trying to build&#13;
        chains that give a role to each country to promoting regional concentration of activities where they&#13;
        are most competitively carried out. At a practical level, it requires ensuring that at an urban scale,&#13;
        obstacles such as inadequate infrastructure and services are not barriers to the location of value chain&#13;
        investment. It is also means active promotion of clusters through support for industry-specific public&#13;
        goods, such as common infrastructure (warehousing, testing facilities, design facilities, and so forth),&#13;
        training, and other services. Part of this strategy may include the development of a coordinated&#13;
        network of industrial parks (if basic industrial infrastructure is a constraint) or SEZs (if there is a need&#13;
        to adopt a regulatory environment on a temporary basis to promote the development of industry).&#13;
&#13;
2. Skills, services, and infrastructure for productivity&#13;
A second plank of a program to support â&#128;&#152;Factory Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; is raising productivity. This was identified in&#13;
the report as an important barrier holding back potential of BLNS countries to leverage some of the&#13;
comparative advantages they have for GVC-oriented production. It is also relevant for South Africa if it is to&#13;
move toward higher value added segments in value chains (see chapter 10, the section â&#128;&#156;SACUâ&#128;&#153;s positioning in&#13;
GVCs and RVCsâ&#128;&#157;).&#13;
    ï&#130;· Raising skills and closing gaps in technical and management skills : Low levels of labor productivity are&#13;
       common across the region and skills, along with poor work ethic (consistently highlighted in&#13;
       Botswana, for example, as the most important barrier to growing productivity). At the lower skill&#13;
       levels, low productivity is matched, outside South Africa at least, with very low wages. The most&#13;
       binding constraints, particularly for countries that aim to compete in higher value-added activities,&#13;
       are in technical and management skills, where pervasive skills gaps results in a large wage premium&#13;
       for these positions, as well as in certain professions like accounting and engineering. Across the&#13;
       region, one of the main problems identified is the inadequate link between institutional and&#13;
       workplace learning. Training centers are also poor. In spite of this, immigration and work permit&#13;
       acquisition procedures remain challenging for foreigners, and a source of constant complaint from&#13;
       foreign companies. These barriers are not simply the result of inefficient bureaucracy but rather the&#13;
       outcome of explicit policies to promote â&#128;&#152;localizationâ&#128;&#153; of skilled jobs. In this tourism sector, lack of&#13;
       harmonization of regional visa rules continues to restrict growth of regional tourism value chains.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Improving the competitive environment for the provision of professional services: This report has&#13;
        highlighted the critical importance of services inputs to support the competitiveness of value chains.&#13;
        In gateway context, access to competitively priced and high-quality services will be fundamental to&#13;
        the proposition of the region. This highlights the importance of building competitive services sectors&#13;
        through investments in skills, and ensuring that policies on competition create a domestic market&#13;
        environment that contributes to ongoing productivity growth within the sector. The need for a&#13;
        competitive service sector also highlights the importance of a more aggressive approach to ensuring&#13;
        liberalized markets for cross-border services trade, as part of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s engagements with SADC&#13;
        and the TFTA.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Improving the reliability of electricity and the quality/pricing of information and communications (ICT)&#13;
        infrastructure: The other factor reducing productivity for manufacturing activities in particular is the&#13;
        lack of reliable access to electricity, an increasing and well-documented problem in the region in&#13;
        recent years. This has particularly hit the competitiveness of firms in Botswana and South Africa. In&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 85&#13;
&amp;#12;        addition to electricity, ICT infrastructure is an increasingly critical source of competitiveness in value&#13;
        chain activities, both for manufacturing activities directly and for the many services functions that are&#13;
        needed to support a competitive value chain. ICT is, for the most part, accessible and competitively&#13;
        priced in South Africa. But that is far from the case in BLNS, where smaller markets contribute to lower&#13;
        competition, resulting in higher prices, and where basic infrastructure remains to be rolled out to&#13;
        large parts of the region.&#13;
&#13;
3. Promoting open regionalism and institutional cooperation&#13;
Finally, a third critical element to an effective gateway strategy involves policy and institutional coordination&#13;
at the regional level. A key challenge to policies that boost a gateway is that many of them must be&#13;
coordinated among all regional states, and among national, provincial, and municipal governments. Economic&#13;
activities concentrate in a gateway and trigger growth impulses for the periphery. Yet, there is a time lag&#13;
between the concentration of economic activities in the gateway, which partly happens at the expense of the&#13;
economic development of the periphery. Moreover, if lagging and leading places are brought together in value&#13;
chains, those that take a subordinate role in the value chain will experience fewer benefits, initially, than those&#13;
that take a superior role. This is clearly a political challenge, in particular for the periphery that may benefit&#13;
later and less than the gateway. Offsetting these political and economic challenges is the fact that over time,&#13;
agglomeration forces will compel dispersion of economic activity into the peripheral region, once the cost&#13;
structure in the leading area rises beyond an optimal level. This is analogous to the flying geese pattern,&#13;
described earlier in this report.&#13;
&#13;
A particular issue for the BLNS states is that South African firms dominate their economic landscapes, with&#13;
MNCs occupying most of the left-over spaces. A central question, therefore, is how BLNS can harness this&#13;
dominance to their own advantage; an approach that requires niche-oriented thinking. Simply put, the BLNS&#13;
governments need to actively identify the value chains their companies can realistically plug into, whether&#13;
RVCs or GVCs, then consciously assist their companies to access them. Therefore, concerted state action is&#13;
necessary, to build the enabling institutional environment MNCs require before they will transfer higher-order&#13;
technologies, and to identify key lead firms for targeted investment promotion into the region. However,&#13;
some SACU countries are pursuing a different policy vision, one more skeptical of foreign direct investment&#13;
(FDI) by MNCs. This policy approach is anchored in a view of RVCs that is akin to import substitution, extended&#13;
from the national terrain to the region. Instead, it would be to the regionâ&#128;&#153;s benefit to think about how to link&#13;
RVCs to GVCs, rather than how to replace MNC activities in the region. This requires a facilitative approach,&#13;
harnessing the gateway and actively promoting South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s lead role. In other words, SACU countries should&#13;
work cooperatively with both South African and foreign MNCs rather than seeking to curtail their activities.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Promoting gateway integration and open regionalism as a way forward for SACU: The current&#13;
        approach to regional integration and RVCs is anchored in import substitution at both the regional and&#13;
        national level. SACU-level trade and industrial policies prioritize RVCs destined for regional markets.&#13;
        At the same time, heavy use of infant industry and other market mechanisms within SACU undermine&#13;
        the prospects for RVC integration in some of the key sectors in the region, most notably agribusiness.&#13;
        More broadly, import substitution is well known to undermine long-term competitiveness, in part by&#13;
        generating strong interest groups that tend to resist reform. Moreover, with regional markets still&#13;
        small, import substitution opportunities will be exhausted quickly. Further, this approach requires a&#13;
        high level of compromise and coordination across countries that remains difficult to achieve in&#13;
        practice. Not all SACU states share the vision of regional import substitution industrialization, since&#13;
        they recognize that they pay part of the cost. Therefore, it is likely that perceptions of relative gains&#13;
        and losses arising from this approach to RVC development will continue to bedevil intra-SACU&#13;
        negotiations. In the context of the ongoing negotiations over SACU revenue sharing and the shift in&#13;
        focus to wider regional agreements like the TFTA and the Pan-African FTA, it may seem that deeper&#13;
                                                                                                               86&#13;
&amp;#12;        integration at the SACU level is unlikely. On the other hand, adopting a gateway strategy to â&#128;&#152;Factory&#13;
        Southern Africaâ&#128;&#153; at the SACU level could provide a common vision and a new relevance for the SACU&#13;
        region. Gateway thinking could allow the SACU to promote deeper regional integration in parallel with&#13;
        openness to wider regional (and indeed global) arrangements.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Strengthening focus and coordination of investment promotion: An important dynamic in this&#13;
        approach is inward investment promotion, namely attraction of lead MNCs to establish in the region.&#13;
        Practically, there are two broad policy dynamics entailed in this approach. The first is promotion of a&#13;
        competitive proposition in order to afford MNCs a favorable location in which to base their facilities.&#13;
        The second policy dynamic is clear targeting of lead MNCs for sustained inward investment&#13;
        promotion. South Africa and its SACU neighbors should together develop an investment promotion&#13;
        strategy based on the gateway and niche value chain strategies, built around areas of regional&#13;
        comparative advantage. The region must then coordinate the supply side policies needed to support&#13;
        the strategy. Strong investment promotion agencies must reside at the apex of this organizational&#13;
        effort. They should be empowered to drive the process in government. Not only would they require&#13;
        technical capacity to understand the GVCs and MNCs being targeted, but they would also require&#13;
        strong political support within government to overcome the inevitable political and bureaucratic&#13;
        hurdles that will arise in the process of negotiating with lead MNCs. Assuming that FDI attraction is a&#13;
        central feature of economic policy, such agencies would need to be central players in the policy&#13;
        formulation process, since they would contain critical tacit and explicit knowledge of how foreign&#13;
        investors think, how they perceive the country, and the issues that constrain establishment of&#13;
        productive facilities through FDI. Moreover, coordinating the investment promotion efforts across the&#13;
        regionâ&#128;&#148;difficult politically as this would beâ&#128;&#148;should be part of the program.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Strengthening regional competition policy: Within the context of regional industrial policy, a SACU-&#13;
        wide approach to competition regulation may have merit in addressing some of the barriers of market&#13;
        dominance (actual and perceived) that restrain RVC development.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Supporting public-private regional supply chain dialogues: Governments across SACU could support&#13;
        regional public-private dialogues built around specific value chains. Bringing together participants at&#13;
        all stages of the value chain from across the region with key government agencies affecting the value&#13;
        chains can offer an effective channel for identifying targeted interventions to support value chain&#13;
        competitiveness and deepen regional integration. Such partnerships could potentially be formed as a&#13;
        natural follow-on from the SACU industrial policy program.&#13;
&#13;
    11.3. Policies to strengthen value chain positioning&#13;
As discussed throughout this report, while value chain participation is one important objective, it is not the&#13;
end game. Being in a value chain today is no guarantee of being in one tomorrow, nor of getting much value&#13;
out of it. That depends on establishing an environment in which firms (domestic and FDI) become&#13;
â&#128;&#152;territorializedâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;that is, they get location-specific advantages that encourage them to invest for the long term.&#13;
Value chain participation also depends on establishing an environment where these firms are able to upgrade&#13;
to higher value-added positioning in the chains. This will ensure greater returns to workers and support&#13;
sustainability of the chains. Strengthening value chain positioning can be achieved through policies and&#13;
strategies that focus on two things: (i) supporting firms to upgrade in value chains; and (ii) â&#128;&#152;densificationâ&#128;&#153; of&#13;
value chains, through broadening and deepening local (and regional) supply relationships. The policies&#13;
required to achieve these are wide-ranging and include many of those already discussed in chapter 10, the&#13;
section â&#128;&#156;How should SACU countries think about GVCs?â&#128;&#148;emerging findings.â&#128;&#157; However, below we outline&#13;
some specific areas of focus:&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Supporting multi-chain upgrading strategies: As discussed throughout this report, the most effective&#13;
        approach for the region is likely to be in linking SACU RVCs â&#128;&#148;upstream, downstream or bothâ&#128;&#148;into&#13;
                                                                                                              87&#13;
&amp;#12;    wider regional (African) and global value chains. It is therefore imperative that the RVCs being&#13;
    considered within the context of the SACU Industrial Policy function well to allow effortless integration&#13;
    into GVCs. And this is a two-way relationship. A recent paper by the Asian Development Bank (ADB&#13;
    2013) suggests that regional economic integration within a GVC environmentâ&#128;&#148;through logistics,&#13;
    information networks, and connectivity improvementâ&#128;&#148;can deliver substantial benefits, with&#13;
    particularly strong benefits for small economies. These include benefits from scale, as well as network,&#13;
    coordination, and agglomeration economies. This approach of linking and combining RVCs and GVCs&#13;
    is also relevant at the individual company level. The idea of â&#128;&#152;multi-chain upgradingâ&#128;&#153; suggests that&#13;
    participation in different value chains offers the potential to leverage competencies and learnings&#13;
    across them. For example, a firm operating in a relatively basic position in a GVC (such as a cut-make-&#13;
    trim [CMT] apparel company) may in parallel be able to enter domestic or regional markets to broaden&#13;
    their scope into design, marketing, and branding (that is, functional upgrading). The domestic firm&#13;
    may succeed because it has a better understanding of home markets than foreign markets, or it may&#13;
    succeed because domestic customers are not as powerful or concentrated as their counterparts in&#13;
    global value chains (Brandt and Thun 2010). Governments could support such strategies at the&#13;
    national and regional level by providing incentives to support regional brand development and&#13;
    regional market entry strategies, such as matching grants, training, and technical assistance.&#13;
    Governments could also provide targeted export promotion assistance, and could facilitate matching&#13;
    among relevant participants at different stages of RVCs.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Clustering for knowledge exchange, supply links, skills: As discussed in the previous section,&#13;
    clustering (or agglomeration more broadly) can be particularly important for achieving scale&#13;
    economies in a region where scale is a significant constraint. It can also support upgrading and&#13;
    densification strategies. Clustering can be supported through co-location of specialized service&#13;
    providers and workers, and facilitating knowledge exchange (both directly and tacitly). Upgrading&#13;
    and densification can be supported by offering the scale to attract specialized suppliers and&#13;
    increasing the potential for subcontracting and other coordinated activities across firms at vertical&#13;
    and horizontal levels in the chain. While it is normally ineffective to attempt to create a cluster from&#13;
    scratch, governments can influence firm location strategies and promote clustering by supporting&#13;
    common user infrastructure and services (common warehousing, design and testing facilities,&#13;
    training, and so forth) where industry-specific agglomerations have already been established.&#13;
    Governments can also help facilitate â&#128;&#152;clusteringâ&#128;&#153; behavior by supporting the development of cluster&#13;
    organization, convening knowledge sharing across firms, and providing co-funding to help catalyze&#13;
    cluster initiatives. Finally in the context of the need for improving labor skills and productivity,&#13;
    clusters may represent an effective entry point for interventions to support skills development.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Supporting the exploitation of regional scale economies: In some value chains, one of the main barriers&#13;
    to sustainability and positioning in value chains is the lack of scale in any one country to support key&#13;
    stages of the value chain. This essentially cuts off integration in the chain and restricts the&#13;
    opportunities for value creation. One well-documented example here is in the textile and apparel&#13;
    value chain, where lack of fabric mills in the region results in production being limited largely to CMT&#13;
    activities. Government and private sector could come together at the regional level to support&#13;
    investment (including attracting FDI) for developing these key â&#128;&#152;missing linksâ&#128;&#153; in the chain through&#13;
    coordination at the regional level to maximize scale potential. There are of course a number of&#13;
    challenges to developing competitive regional fabric production in this example (and, similarly, there&#13;
    will be challenges in all such sectors). A thorough, objective feasibility assessment would be needed&#13;
    to ensure such an investment would be economically viable.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Investing in ICT to close the distance gap and promote coordination : As discussed in chapter 5, ICT is&#13;
    particularly important in remote countries as a facilitator of information and coordination in value&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          88&#13;
&amp;#12;    chains. For firms operating in more complex value chains, effective use of ICT is critical to maintain&#13;
    flexibility and to support coordination of complex tasks. For many firms in the region, particularly&#13;
    outside South Africa, ICT infrastructure is insufficient and pricing uncompetitive. Moreover, ICT&#13;
    capabilities are limited in many smaller companies. Governments could support improved ICT&#13;
    capabilities through investment in infrastructure (including â&#128;&#152;last mileâ&#128;&#153; broadband), stronger&#13;
    promotion of competition in ICT markets, and support for firms to invest in ICT systems/applications&#13;
    and training.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Active partnerships to support supply chain development: All parties in the value chain have an&#13;
    incentive to build stronger local supply linksâ&#128;&#148;including foreign lead firms. Lead firms may have&#13;
    established global supply relationships and will not be willing to lower quality standards to take local&#13;
    suppliers. However, they will always prefer local supply (for flexibility, transport cost, and coordination&#13;
    purposes) if local suppliers can meet global quality requirements at a reasonable cost. While the&#13;
    private parties have the most to gain from these supply relationships, there do exist information&#13;
    failures that restrict the formation of supply relationships. Government can support sector-wide&#13;
    partnerships with lead firms to close information gaps on both sides. In addition, governments can&#13;
    identify and disseminate information on lead firm requirements and supplier capabilities, and&#13;
    facilitate matching between lead firms and suppliers.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Supporting outward FDI in value chains: Finally, the evidence from South Africa shows that outward&#13;
    investment in value chains can have a significant positive impact in pulling through domestic suppliers&#13;
    and integrating them into regional (and global) value chains. Thus, as South Africa and other regional&#13;
    lead firms (the regionâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;flying geeseâ&#128;&#153;) move into wider African and global markets, they will invariably&#13;
    pull along their existing domestic and regional suppliers. Government support for these supply&#13;
    relationships should not be necessary, as the private sector, including lead firms and the suppliers,&#13;
    have sufficient incentives and capture all the benefits. But government promotion of outward FDIâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
    through support for market information and risk capital if neededâ&#128;&#148;can be seen as one important&#13;
    plank of a program designed to support value chain integration and upgrading.&#13;

3 For example, this information could be valuable in determining the effect of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s currency appreciation on exports or in&#13;
&#13;
predicting the impact of exogenous shocks on welfare or employment.&#13;
4 Backward linkages in the Francois et al. (2013) database serve as a reasonable proxy for the DVA embodied in exports, as the share&#13;
&#13;
of re-imported intermediates is generally negligible. This analysis draws on input-output data available from the GTAP dataset.&#13;

&#13;
8 DVA and FVA by definition should equal to the total sum of exports. Thusâ&#128;&#148;as the corollary of DVAâ&#128;&#148;a declining share of DVA in total&#13;
&#13;
gross exports will by definition result in increased foreign value added as a share of exports. Due to the balancing considerations&#13;
outlined earlier, this does not hold completely for the Eora dataset.&#13;

&#13;
12 Eighty-three percent of SMIâ&#128;&#153;s total volume is imported as carcasses from South Africa and sold in the local market. The main reason&#13;
&#13;
for SMIâ&#128;&#153;s high level of imports is the lack of sufficient supply of cattle produced in Swaziland&#13;
13 South Africa experienced an outbreak of FMD in northern KwaZulu-Natal in February/March 2011. This resulted in South Africa&#13;
&#13;
being delisted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as having a zone free from FMD and stopped exports of cloven-&#13;
hoofed livestock and wildlife from South Africa to other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries.&#13;
14 An export abattoir requires a high level of capital investment, with fixed costs contributing an estimated 70 percent of total operating&#13;
&#13;
costs, meaning that achieving high-capacity utilization is critical for the economics of the operation. Estimates of capacity utilization&#13;
at BMC and Meatco (Namibia) are around 63 percent, while at SMI utilization in 2013 was just 22 percent.&#13;
15 In the case of poultry, feed is estimated to account for up to 70 percent of the costs of broiler production.&#13;

17 The survey focuses specifically on technical services (engineering, technical/quality, and agricultural extension services) and&#13;
&#13;
business services (design, marketing, and accounting) and excludes financial and transport services.&#13;
18 In this paper, we refer to Eastern Europe as EU11 countries plus Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
19 Association of Southeast Asian Nationsâ&#128;&#148;includes most of the main trading countries of Southeast Asia.&#13;
&#13;
20 This index in constructed as follows: GDP-weighted bilateral distance (60 percent); GDP-weighted bilateral logistics performance&#13;
&#13;
index score (20 percent); GDP-weighted bilateral trading partners sharing a common official language (20 percent). Data for the index&#13;
are sourced from CEPII (http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/welcome.asp).&#13;
21 http://www.doingbusiness.org/.&#13;
22 This is likely to be true whether the producers make use of imported intermediates (which face tariffs) or domestically supplied ones&#13;
&#13;
(whose producers have the scope to raise their own prices up to the level of the international price plus the tariff duty without running&#13;
the risk of being displaced by imports).&#13;
23 Cumulation allows PTA producers to import nonoriginating materials from other PTA member countries without affecting the final&#13;
&#13;
productâ&#128;&#153;s originating status. Diagonal cumulation allows for cumulation from across any member of the PTA.&#13;
24 The decision of a multinational to establish a vertically linked subsidiary is a strong measure of GVC integration.&#13;
&#13;
25 Duty-free tariff lines comprise 100 percent of lines with SADC and 86 percent with the EU under the South Africa-EU Trade and&#13;
&#13;
Development Cooperation Agreement (data from the WTO tariff database).&#13;
26 The FTA calls for 60 percent tariff liberalization at the launch; SACU countries already have 56 percent of MFN tariff lines duty free.&#13;
&#13;
27 These are expected to be addressed in a â&#128;&#152;phase 2â&#128;&#153; of the agreement.&#13;

29 Note that issues that were highly specific to a single industry are not included in this table.&#13;
&#13;
30 The Enterprise Surveys datasets for Botswana and Lesotho do not include data on labor productivity, so they could not be included&#13;
&#13;
in the analysis.&#13;
31 We also control for capital intensity, measured as capital stock per employee, and ensure that standard errors are robust to&#13;
&#13;
heteroskedasticity.&#13;
32 Data from the overall sample excludes the individual countries for which the country dummy is used in each equation. Therefore,&#13;
&#13;
the result for the â&#128;&#152;overall sampleâ&#128;&#153; varies slightly in each case. Here we present the results for the sample excluding South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                       93&#13;
&amp;#12;33 As we do not have panel data we cannot test how this changes over time, but there is reason to believe that it may attenuate over&#13;
time as the productivity spillover benefits begin to outweigh the productivity losses that may stem from competition for markets,&#13;
human capital, and potentially finance.&#13;
34 We report the results here specifically for South Africa. The analysis has also been run for Botswana â&#128;&#148;results for this are reported&#13;
&#13;
in the background working pape available on request from the World Bank.&#13;

            Factory Southern Africa? : SACU in global
            value chains - summary report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Once concentrated among a few large
            economies, global flows of goods, services, and capital now
            reach an ever-larger number of countries worldwide. Global
            trade in goods and in services both increased 10 times
            between 1980 and 2011, while foreign direct investment (FDI)
            flows increased almost 30-fold. A value chain is global when
            some of these stages are carried out in more than one
            country, most notably when discrete tasks within a
            production process are fragmented and dispersed across a
            number of countries. Southern African Customs Union (SACU) -
            region global value chains (GVCs) are both a new reality and
            significant opportunity for expanding non-commodity exports
            to support growth, diversification, and job creation in the
            region. The task-based nature of GVCs creates opportunities
            for developing countries to establish very quickly a
            position in global trade within a sector in which they may
            have had no previous experience. For South Africa, GVCs are
            seen as a route to higher manufacturing exports and greater
            value addition. For other SACU countries, GVCs are seen as a
            route to diversification and global integration, and to
            leverage the possibility of greater investment from South
            Africa itself. The main objectives of the study are as
            follows: (i) to understand trends of GVC participation and
            competitiveness of South Africa and the wider SACU region,
            the outcomes from this participation (exports, jobs, and
            productivity), and the factors that determine
            competitiveness; (ii) to map the extent of value chain
            integration across the region and identify barriers to
            deeper integration; and (iii) to identify policies and
            actions that will be required to develop a globally
            competitive, high value-adding factory Southern Africa.
