            Competing private ports - lessons from Argentina
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Port reforms in Argentina have sought to
            deregulate, decentralize, and privatize. And they have
            sought to introduce competition not only among ports but
            also for the ports --by inviting operators to bid for port
            concessions-- and within the ports-- by dividing large ports
            into terminals and offering each as a separate concession.
            Bidders were asked to set their own charges, subject to a
            maximum price cap for cargo, and concessions were awarded on
            the basis of the highest rental offered for the
            infrastructure and equipment. The results have been
            generally positive, with increased productivity, higher
            cargo volumes, and big reductions in tariffs. The authors
            look at the lessons from the reform and set out the
            remaining challenges.
