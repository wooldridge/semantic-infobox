TO:    The President, International Development Association&#13;
Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement&#13;
on the proposed Additional Financing (Science and Technology Higher Education Project) to&#13;
the United Republic of Tanzania&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of the International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association grant to the United&#13;
Republic of Tanzania (the Recipient) an additional financing in an amount equivalent to SDR 9,800,000.&#13;
The purpose of said additional financing is to assist the Recipient in: (i) to increase the quantity and quality&#13;
of higher education graduates, with special emphasis on science, technology and education; and (ii) to lay&#13;
the foundations for improved responsiveness of tertiary education to the labor market, all through the&#13;
provision of additional funds to supplement the financial assistance furnished by the Association under the&#13;
Credit Number 4454-TA, dated July 10, 2008, between the United Republic of Tanzania and the&#13;
International Development Association.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such an additional&#13;
financing, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the additional financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project in support of which the proceeds of such additional&#13;
financing are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I&#13;
of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
United Republic of Tanzania and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the United&#13;
Republic of Tanzania.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project continues to merit financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such additional assistance.&#13;
