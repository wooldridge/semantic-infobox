THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Latin America &amp; Caribbean&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: Lower middle income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 6,383,752&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 3,780&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 86&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 97*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 59.94&#13;

absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        Obtain construction line and site qualification&#13;
&#13;
        To request a construction line, BuildCo must present the deed of&#13;
        ownership and a topographical plan with geodesic coordinates.&#13;
        This is required to ensure that public works (street or highway)&#13;
        will not affect the land. The construction line is the document&#13;
        that defines the alignment of new construction with the&#13;
        Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (AMSS) road network. It&#13;
        describes the right of way, retract area, and transversal section of&#13;
        the road projects to be developed, or widening to be undertaken&#13;
        in the San Salvador metropolitan area. The document is valid for          11 days             no charge&#13;
   2&#13;
        5 years. For San Salvador, this document should be requested at&#13;
        the Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San Salvador&#13;
        (OPAMSS).&#13;
&#13;
        The site or land qualification defines whether the proposed&#13;
        construction is allowed on that land for the use projected. The&#13;
        compatibility of land use is based on reference to the soil matrix,&#13;
        as defined in the General Plan of Zoning in force for AMSS,&#13;
        which indicates the requirements for project development. This&#13;
        document is valid for 12 months and should be requested from&#13;
        OPAMSS, the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of&#13;

      the Classification of Activities, Works and Projects) published in&#13;
      the Diario Oficial No 162, Tomo No 380 from September 1st&#13;
      2008, the warehouse in the Doing Business case study would fall&#13;
      under Category 'A' which is exempt from an Environmental&#13;
      Impact Study. In this case, all that is required is for the architect&#13;
      or engineer to fill out an Environmental Form and submit it to          21 days       no charge&#13;
3&#13;
      MARN (Ministry of Environment). The Form outlines the project&#13;
      and its potential environmental impact. MARN will then decide if&#13;
      the work can be considered exempt from the full impact study. In&#13;
      the Doing Business case study, the project would most likely be&#13;
      exempt from the full impact study.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;
when outages exceed a certain cap).                        companies and national regulators on SAIDI and SAIFI.&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

      The deed is presented to the Registry office for registration&#13;
&#13;
      The public deed is filed at the Register of Property to be recorded under&#13;
      the name of the buyer. The deed will be registered, if it meets all the&#13;
      legal requirements, in 2 - 4 weeks. The registry has to check with the&#13;
      Ministry of Finance ("Hacienda") if the parties are Tax solvent. In addition&#13;
      to reforms at the registry set out by the Law on Standard Procedures of&#13;
      August 2004, an electronic system is currently being introduced and,&#13;
      once fully functional, is expected to reduce the registration time. In&#13;
      addition, a special service is available (mainly used by banks, law firms or&#13;
      companies). Upon signing a special agreement with the registry, certain 14-28 days (10-&#13;

      in exchange for a premium payment. The payment is a fixed amount&#13;
      determined according to a cost table. The amount is usually&#13;
      automatically withdrawn from a special running account at the registry.&#13;
      At the time of signing the agreement, the user sets up this account,&#13;
      depositing a certain amount (not more than US$ 100). The agreement&#13;
      has to be renewed on an annual basis. This service is not taken into&#13;
      account here, since it is only one transaction.&#13;

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous&#13;
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                               After Mirageâ&#128;&#153;s default, the most likely scenario for BizBank would be to start a&#13;
                                foreclosure proceeding in order sale the estate used as a collateral. Mirage&#13;
                              would not be able to request any suspension of the enforcement action to avoid&#13;
                                      foreclosure because the law does not provide for this possibility.&#13;
&#13;
                             In a foreclosure procedure based on the Civil Procedure Code, the creditor would&#13;
                               request the payment by filing a claim before the court. The debtor would have&#13;
Proceedin     foreclosure      the opportunity to counter-claim. After that an approval to initiate foreclosure&#13;
g                                will be handed down by the Court and an order to set up an auction will be&#13;
                             issued. Once the time allocated by law for appeal lapses, the court would appoint&#13;
                              an auctioneer to sell the debtor's assets pledged as collateral in a public auction.&#13;
                                The Court would subsequently validate the distrib ution of the debtorâ&#128;&#153;s assets&#13;
                                                            among the creditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                              The foreclosure proceeding will take approximately 3.5 years in El Salvador from&#13;
                             the moment of Mirageâ&#128;&#153;s default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. It&#13;
                               will take 1 year until the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the&#13;
                               Court including all required notifications and the debtorâ&#128;&#153;s counter-claim. After&#13;
 Time (in&#13;
                  3.5         that, it would take 2 years for the auction to take place (including the necessary&#13;
years)&#13;
                              time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the auction and the sale of the&#13;
                                real estate). It will take additional 6 months for the judge to approve the sale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               For a foreclosure proceeding, the estimate cost would be 12% of the value of&#13;
                               Mirageâ&#128;&#153;s estate. The main component of the cost are the attorneyâ&#128;&#153;s fees (8%)&#13;
 Cost (% of                    which are based on Art. 700 of the Civil Procedure Code. The rest (3%) will be&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for El
            Salvador. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 El Salvador ranks 86. A high ease of
            doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is
            more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
