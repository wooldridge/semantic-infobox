I. BACKROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
A. The Conflict and its Consequences&#13;
1.    Afghanistan-suffering from more than 20 years of conflict, a three-year drought,&#13;
loss or degradation of most of its infrastructure, depletion of its human resource base, and&#13;
erosion of social capital-is one of the poorest and longest-suffering countries among the&#13;
members of the World Bank.&#13;
2.    The long drawn-out war of Soviet occupation and subsequent internecine conflict&#13;
severely damaged Afghanistan's economy. By the mid-1990s, most of the country's&#13;
limited modern infrastructure was destroyed, and traditional irrigation systems greatly&#13;
suffered from destruction and lack of maintenance. Even more important than the&#13;
physical damage were the increasing breakdown of the state and civil society over time&#13;
and the progressive erosion of institutions-both modern and traditional-which had&#13;
governed the pre-war economy and society. Government-provided social services, which&#13;
never had a strong outreach into rural areas, atrophied and to a large extent stopped&#13;
functioning.  Inflation wiped out the value of the Afghan currency in the 1990s.&#13;
Agricultural output fell, livestock herds were depleted, and large-scale industries almost&#13;
ceased functioning. Millions of Afghans became refugees in neighboring countries. And&#13;
finally, the indiscriminate and wide strewing of landmines caused enormous human and&#13;
economic losses.&#13;
3.    There was a modest economic recovery in the mid-1990s in areas that became&#13;
largely free of conflict, showing the resilience of the Afghan population. Agricultural&#13;
production increased; livestock herds sharply rose in numbers taking advantage of widely&#13;
available unutilized grazing lands; and horticultural production also grew based on&#13;
restoration and expansion of orchards and vineyards. Substantial numbers of refugees&#13;
returned to their homes. The return of some stability in large parts of the country also&#13;
facilitated the growth of various kinds of unofficial economic activity, most notably long-&#13;
distance trade (particularly re-exports to Pakistan) and opium poppy cultivation. In&#13;
addition, uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources-timber, gems, marble and&#13;
granite-resulted  in  extensive  deforestation  and  environmental  degradation.&#13;
Furthermore, the deterioration in social services (particularly education) was aggravated&#13;
by the Taliban regime's social policies, which largely excluded women from work and&#13;
girls from school.&#13;
4.    More recently, Afghanistan has been hit by a severe, protracted drought, which&#13;
started in 1999 and is on-going (although current winter precipitation gives ground for&#13;
hope that the drought is ending). Given the breakdown of the state and civil society, and&#13;
consequent inability to respond adequately, this drought led to serious malnutrition and&#13;
risk of famine. Crop production was halved and livestock herds heavily depleted, more&#13;
than erasing the modest gains of the early and mid-1990s. Large and increasing numbers&#13;
of people have lost their means of livelihood and have become displaced, either internally&#13;
or to neighboring countries. Malnutrition has significantly worsened, and mortality rates&#13;
appear to have risen sharply, especially for children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.    In summary, an estimated seven million people remain vulnerable to hunger and&#13;
very large numbers are dependent on a massive inflow of food aid. Afghanistan's&#13;
infrastructure has been destroyed or degraded; its human resource base severely depleted;&#13;
and its social capital eroded. State institutions are largely non-functional, and the&#13;
economy and society have become increasingly fragmented. Thus, Afghanistan faces&#13;
serious political problems, a dire humanitarian emergency in the short run, and large&#13;
needs for reconstruction and development over time.&#13;
6.    International assistance to Afghanistan prior to the latest developments (recently&#13;
in the range of US$200-300 million annually) has gone overwhelmingly for humanitarian&#13;
relief purposes, much of it in the form of food aid and other in-kind assistance. However,&#13;
in the context of a complex, emergency situation that has endured over many years, the&#13;
distinction between humanitarian and development activities was blurred. In the absence&#13;
of effectively functioning government service delivery, NGOs have been the main actors&#13;
in many sectors, such as primary education (especially for girls), rural water supply, basic&#13;
healthcare, and de-mining.  While key development sectors like education and&#13;
infrastructure have accounted for only a small proportion of total assistance, NGOs and&#13;
UN agencies essentially took up the task of providing essential social services to parts of&#13;
the population, building on community-based efforts in various parts of the country.&#13;
B. The Transition to Peace&#13;
7.    The tragic events of September 11, 2001 precipitated wholesale changes in the&#13;
political and military situation in Afghanistan, transforming the overall context for&#13;
national reconstruction and for World Bank support to Afghanistan. The military&#13;
intervention of US-led coalition forces led, within two months, to the collapse of the&#13;
Taliban regime. This was followed by the conclusion on December 5, 2001, in Bonn,&#13;
Germany, of the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the&#13;
Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions (a.k.a. the Bonn Agreement), an&#13;
agreement among the different groups in opposition to the Taliban regime on a new&#13;
structure of government and a process that would lead to the election of a fully&#13;
representative government within a period of about two and a half years. The Interim&#13;
Authority, which consists of the Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA), a Special&#13;
Independent Commission for the Convening of the Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand&#13;
National Assembly), and a Supreme Court of Afghanistan, is expected to remain in&#13;
power for six months. Fully vested with the sovereign functions of government, the AIA&#13;
peacefully took over central administration on December 22, 2001. An Emergency Loya&#13;
Jirga will be convened within six months of that date. It will decide on a Transitional&#13;
Authority that is expected to pave the way for a new Constitution and an elected, fully&#13;
representative government for Afghanistan within two years. The Interim Authority and&#13;
the Transitional Authority will govern Afghanistan in accordance the 1964 Constitution&#13;
and existing laws and regulations, except where superseded by the Bonn Agreement. The&#13;
Interim Authority has the power to repeal and amend laws and regulations by decree.&#13;
8.    The AIA has moved quickly to restore basic government functions and re-&#13;
establish international relations. Despite being hampered by very limited capacity and&#13;
the difficult security situation in many parts of the country, the AIA has made&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
considerable progress and has gained widespread international recognition and&#13;
considerable domestic moral authority. However, expectations among the population for&#13;
a "peace dividend" are high, and if the AIA (and its successor) does not delivery results&#13;
relatively quickly, the prospects for further progress and the peace process could dim.&#13;
9.    IDA has analyzed the Bonn Agreement and concluded that the AIA does not&#13;
constitute a "de facto government" for the purposes of Operational Policy 7.30, on&#13;
account of both the substance of Operational Policy 7.30 and the World Bank's practice&#13;
in applying it. The Bonn Agreement states explicitly that the Interim Authority is the&#13;
"repository of Afghan sovereignty," and the AIA, which is part of the Interim Authority,&#13;
is "entrusted with the day-to-day conduct of the affairs of the state." The functions of the&#13;
AIA have the attributes of those enjoyed by a government. Therefore, the AIA is a&#13;
"government" for the purposes of Operational Policy 7.30.&#13;
C. Key Priorities for Afghanistan&#13;
10.   The reconstruction and development agenda facing Afghanistan is massive.&#13;
Afghanistan's economy is in a state of collapse. The three-year drought and resulting&#13;
dislocation and hunger, the interruption of trade via Pakistan as a result of developments&#13;
following September 11, and the continuing massive displacement of population, have&#13;
exhausted what coping capacity was left among Afghan families and civil society. The&#13;
key economic institutions of State-central bank, budget preparation, execution and&#13;
monitoring, tax collection and customs, statistics, civil service, law and order, and the&#13;
judicial system-are extremely weak. Basic infrastructure-roads, bridges, irrigation&#13;
canals, telecommunications, water and power supply, and markets-have been destroyed&#13;
or oriented toward the war effort.&#13;
11.   Access to education in Afghanistan, and the quality of the education which is&#13;
available, remain poor at all levels. The primary gross enrolment rate has been most&#13;
recently estimated at 38 percent for boys and three percent for girls. Secondary and&#13;
higher education, crucial for producing future skilled professionals, present an even&#13;
bleaker picture. The situation in health is equally grim. Infant mortality is estimated by&#13;
UN agencies and NGOs to be one of the highest in the world at around 165 per 1,000 live&#13;
births, while 257 of every 1,000 live births die before they reach five years of age. The&#13;
maternal mortality rate is estimated to be 1,700 per 100,000 live births, with nearly 99&#13;
percent of deliveries taking place at home and only nine percent being attended by trained&#13;
personnel. Only around 30 percent of children under one year are fully immunized, and&#13;
life expectancy at birth is estimated at around 41 years of age. In addition, Afghanistan&#13;
probably has the largest population of disabled in the world as the direct or indirect&#13;
consequence of war. A recent study funded by the World Bank estimated that, in the&#13;
1990s, as many as 500 persons per month have been victims of mine accidents and&#13;
unexploded ordnance.&#13;
12.   Women and children are among the hardest hit from decades of conflict and&#13;
policies of marginalization. Specific attention is needed to the difficulties faced by&#13;
Afghan women and the role they can and should play in rebuilding the country. Further,&#13;
promoting and protecting human rights, promoting social, economic and political&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inclusion of vulnerable groups, protecting children (particularly child combatants), and&#13;
facilitating the return of refugees and internally displaced persons are all early priorities.&#13;
And this all needs to be achieved in the context of an ethnically diverse country where&#13;
social, political and geographic dispersion means that a central government will need to&#13;
provide an enabling environment for local community participation.&#13;
13.   Recognizing the importance of reconstruction as well as the need to address&#13;
longer-term development issues, the international community rapidly organized a number&#13;
of meetings on Afghanistan's reconstruction, starting even before the coming of power of&#13;
the AIA.   These included the meeting of the newly-formed Steering Group in&#13;
Washington, DC on November 20, 2001, a conference on preparing for Afghanistan's&#13;
reconstruction organized by the World Bank and UNDP, together with ADB, in&#13;
Islamabad during November 27-29, 2001, a second meeting of the Steering Group in&#13;
Brussels on December 5-6, 2001, and the International Conference on Reconstruction&#13;
Assistance to Afghanistan held in Tokyo on January 21-22, 2002. In addition there were&#13;
two meetings in Brussels on gender issues in Afghanistan, and a parallel NGO meeting to&#13;
the Bonn negotiation process. At the Washington meeting, the World Bank, UNDP and&#13;
ADB were asked to produce a preliminary needs assessment for Afghanistan's&#13;
reconstruction prior to the Tokyo meeting. The preliminary needs assessment, completed&#13;
on a very tight time schedule by a team of more than 60 staff of the three agencies, was&#13;
well received at the Tokyo meeting, which generated total pledges of external support for&#13;
Afghanistan's reconstruction of $1.8 billion for the first year and $4.5 billion for the first&#13;
30 months. The AIA, represented at the Tokyo meeting by its Chairman, emphasized its&#13;
commitment to reconstruction and its determination to lead this effort, coupled with a&#13;
strong commitment to financial transparency and accountability.&#13;
14.   Although the Tokyo meeting was successful in generating large pledges of&#13;
financial support for Afghanistan's reconstruction, realizing these pledges, and using&#13;
them effectively, is going to require significantly stronger fiduciary assurances and&#13;
implementation capacity than currently exist within the AIA. Improving procurement,&#13;
financial management and audit systems and augmenting them-temporarily with outside&#13;
capacity-is hence crucial.&#13;
D. Features of the Existing Public Administration&#13;
15.   Not much detail is known about the current status of Afghanistan's public&#13;
administration. World Bank and IMF missions during January and February have&#13;
ascertained that extensive procedures and regulations exist, many of which seem&#13;
theoretically adequate for basic purposes, but most of have not been applied for many&#13;
years. Only a limited number of basic administrative functions have continued to be&#13;
carried out. While some mid-level and lower-level government employees remain in&#13;
post, many others have left theirjobs. Given the existence of functioning processes in the&#13;
past, Afghanistan is not an institutional tabula rasa; it will be important for reforms to&#13;
build on existing institutional arrangements. Given the non-functional situation of most&#13;
systems, however, the time is opportune to rethink appropriate institutional arrangements.&#13;
Some additional governance information is provided in Annex I. This section provides a&#13;
preliminary assessment of key areas.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16.   Existing civil service. Reliable data on the number of active public sector&#13;
employees in Afghanistan are not available. There are approximately 219,000 sanctioned&#13;
posts in the total public sector.' MOF and UNDP estimate that approximately 80,000&#13;
staff are currently verified as at their posts. This verification process to date has been&#13;
mostly in Kabul city and province. There is considerable uncertainty associated with&#13;
estimates of the current size of the civil service. Plans are underway to undertake some&#13;
spot-checking, including outside of Kabul, to attempt to increase the degree of confidence&#13;
in employment estimates. Currently, wage paymnents are being made in Kabul through a&#13;
UNDP Start-Up Fund, where funds are transferred to the Government Treasury for salary&#13;
payments based on confirmed payrolls using the existing manual check payment&#13;
process.2 Teams are currently on site in three neighboring provinces to verify payroll&#13;
lists so that payments can be made.&#13;
17.   Reintegration of former civil servants back into the civil service has been mostly&#13;
completed in Kabul. However, this is not the case in the provinces. Thus, there could be&#13;
significant increases in the numbers of identified civil servants over the next few months.&#13;
The administration seems to have a relatively well-developed system for ensuring that&#13;
staff claiming to be returning civil servants did in fact have a position previously.&#13;
Although many recruitment records have been destroyed, attendance records have been&#13;
well preserved, and returning staff are checked against previous attendance.&#13;
18.   It is likely that the eventual number of in-post civil servants, while few in&#13;
number-even compared with the number that would be required in a streamlined, highly&#13;
efficient public administration-will not have the skill profiles needed for a modern&#13;
public administration. Consequently, the immediate issue is not to define some "optimal"&#13;
size of total government employment, but rather to ensure appropriate staffing for urgent&#13;
priorities. The medium term agenda will also need to consider possible severance&#13;
packages for existing civil servants without the requisite skills. Further, focused attention&#13;
is needed immediately to guard against inevitable pressures on the authorities to hire&#13;
more and more people, as a form of political and social safety net. Limiting total public&#13;
administration employment to the minimum efficient workforce will provide the fiscal&#13;
space for adequately compensating government employees. It is strongly recommended&#13;
that the authorities consider issuing a decree that makes any new recruitment now taking&#13;
place subject to confirmation by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) when it is&#13;
established. UNDP is providing assistance to establish the CSC.&#13;
19.   Currently, civil service wage scales are very compressed. Within the twelve&#13;
grades, the average total compensation at the highest grade is only 1.2 times higher than&#13;
in the lowest grade. Average pay ranges from a low of 1,358,000 AFA per month&#13;
(US$36.70) to a high of 1,580,000 AFA (US$42.70). Pension levels are negligible.&#13;
During FY013, about 62,500 civil servants received pensions totaling some 26 billion&#13;
AFA (five percent of the wage bill). The forthcoming budget will likely contain a wage&#13;
' This number stems from the organizational chart of government from the 1970s.&#13;
2 This UNDP Start-Up Fund is expected to cease operating by the end of July. The Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), for which the World Bank is the administrator, is one vehicle through&#13;
which donors can continue to assist in financing recurrent cost requirements.&#13;
3 FYOI refers to the period March 21, 2000-March 20, 2001.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
envelope that would permit a doubling of the average civil service wage and significant&#13;
decompression of the salary scale by focusing pay increases on the higher grade ranges.4&#13;
Attention to pension reform will also be needed.&#13;
20.    Two issues are worth highlighting. First, it is essential that donors do not entice&#13;
qualified staff away from the civil service, nor create insulated project management&#13;
units-within or outside the administration-that compensate staff outside of an agreed,&#13;
fiscally sustainable framework. Second, the re-integration of ex-combatants into society&#13;
is a key priority. However, it will be important to resist the understandable temptation to&#13;
do so by providing ex-combatants with public sector jobs (except, on a selective basis, in&#13;
police and security). In other countries, this approach has resulted in ineffective service&#13;
delivery, fiscal stress, and general dissatisfaction.&#13;
21.    Budget preparation. The AIA is preparing a budget for FY03, which starts on&#13;
March 21, 2002. Several partners, including IDA, the IMF, the United States, and&#13;
UNDP, are providing assistance. The short time span and the high degree of uncertainty&#13;
around expenditure needs have made this process very difficult. While a reasonable first&#13;
quarter budget is likely, figures for the last three quarters will be more indicative.&#13;
Further, the lack of firm commitments from donors-particularly for recurrent&#13;
expenditures-has made it difficult for the authorities to finalize even a first quarter&#13;
budget that is fully financed.&#13;
22.    Financial management. A preliminary assessment indicates that the expenditure&#13;
process, as set out in the existing Budget Law, Accounting Regulations and Treasury&#13;
Manual, while overly complex, seems functionally sound with requisite checks and&#13;
balances. Financial management systems continued to operate largely in the same&#13;
manner through various political periods, although recently much of the accounting and&#13;
nearly all the reporting aspects have not been carried out. The organizational structure&#13;
for expenditure management within the MOF consists of the Departments of Accounting&#13;
and Treasury, financial controllers in Ministries and Agencies, and a regional Mustouflat&#13;
network. Senior MOF staff seem well versed in how the financial management system is&#13;
intended to operate.&#13;
23.    There are well-specified procedures for tracking and making budget expenditures,&#13;
starting with the release of appropriations by the MOF through to payment to suppliers.&#13;
Further, the use of a chart of General Ledger Accounts would, in theory, allow budget&#13;
allotments, commitments, accounts payable, and completed payments to be tracked and&#13;
reported at regular intervals.&#13;
24.    While workable on paper, there are some practical difficulties in making the&#13;
system functional. First, while re-establishing the system at the center may be relatively&#13;
straightforward, extending it to the provinces may prove more challenging. Some&#13;
preliminary steps towards extending payments (payroll) outside of Kabul have started,&#13;
but these payments have not yet been made. Second, lack of fiscal discipline at the&#13;
4 This does not imply that the salary of each civil servant will be doubled. Rather, the intention is to&#13;
decompress the wage structure by leaving salary levels in the lower grades unchanged while more&#13;
substantially increasing salary levels in the higher grades.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
commitment stage, coupled with infrequent offsetting within the governmental single&#13;
account, means there is a real risk that a deficit can build up. Third, the entire operation&#13;
is manual, making it impossible to produce timely, complete and accurate reports.&#13;
25.   Further, once fully functioning, the expenditure management system can still only&#13;
confirm that funds have been withdrawn from the Treasury for approved purposes. The&#13;
system cannot control what happens to the funds after they are withdrawn. This issue&#13;
needs to be addressed by expenditure tracking and confirmation that desired outputs are&#13;
in fact delivered.&#13;
26.   Audit. The Auditor General is responsible to the Chairman's Office for the audit&#13;
of budget execution in accordance with budget appropriation and financial regulations.&#13;
The Auditor General Office (AGO) is required to provide an audit report on the annual&#13;
Final Accounts when available, but accounts have not been produced by the MOF for at&#13;
least eight years. It appears that the AGO has continued to function in a limited fashion.&#13;
There is a well-defined organizational structure with key positions staffed by individuals&#13;
who have received international training, albeit some 25 years ago. There are 150&#13;
auditors; however no assessment has been made of their qualifications and capacity.&#13;
27.   Payment Systems.     The Central Bank appears to have long-standing and&#13;
adequate regulations and procedures for facilitating governmental payments.&#13;
Historically, its branches in each province around the country had cash available to make&#13;
payments, as requested by the Treasury. Currently, the Central Bank branches outside of&#13;
Kabul are not fully functioning and are not able to make payments. The IMF is currently&#13;
working with the Central Bank to re-establish its operations, both in Kabul and&#13;
throughout the country. There is an urgent need for the Central Bank to become&#13;
functional throughout the country as soon as possible so that payrnents can be made by&#13;
the AIA.&#13;
28.   Summary. The AIA fully recognizes shortcomings in local capacity. It also&#13;
endorses the urgency to implement aid effectively, and it has made repeated, strong&#13;
commitments to transparency.  In a statement at the International Conference on&#13;
Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan held on January 21-22 in Tokyo, the Chairman&#13;
of the AIA, H.E. Hamid Karzai stated:&#13;
Our vision is of a prosperous, secure Afghanistan. We are marching ahead with&#13;
the objective of building a credible State with an efficient and transparent&#13;
govemment. Our govemment shall be accountable to its citizens as well as to the&#13;
intemational community. ... Our goal is that the rule of law and transparent&#13;
systems would eventually allow us to realize the potential of our own natural and&#13;
human resources.&#13;
He went on to say that the AIA "need[s] urgent technical assistance to create the&#13;
procedures and systems to allow for full transparency, accountability and predictability&#13;
between central government and each of the recipients [of budget resources]." The&#13;
proposed Project addresses urgent requirements in precisely these areas.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. IDA'S RESPONSE&#13;
A. Afghanistan's Relations with IDA&#13;
29.   Afghanistan is a member of IDA, IFC, the IMF, and the ADB. Afghanistan&#13;
became a member of the IMF and the World Bank in 1955. IDA has provided 21&#13;
development credits to Afghanistan since 1964 in a wide range of sectors including&#13;
education, roads and agricultural activities. The last two development credits approved by&#13;
the Board for Afghanistan in June 1979 were for roads and rural development. Of the&#13;
original US$230 million approved by IDA for Afghanistan, US$83 million was disbursed&#13;
and US$147 million was subsequently canceled. IDA operations were suspended shortly&#13;
after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Resident Mission in Kabul was&#13;
closed. Afghanistan has repaid US$9.2 million to IDA and was up to date on debt service&#13;
payments until June 1992, when the country went into non-accrual status. Lending&#13;
operations remained suspended due to the continuing fighting, absence of a national&#13;
government, and Afghanistan's entry into non-accrual status with IDA.&#13;
30.   Afghanistan's Arrears to International Financial Institutions.  Resuming&#13;
nornal financial relations with the IFIs will require Afghanistan to clear outstanding&#13;
arrears which total, as of January 31, 2002, about US$51 million including US$25.2&#13;
million to IDA, around US$16 million to the ADB, and US$9.8 million to the IMF. The&#13;
AIA is committed clearing its outstanding arrears, which will set the stage for a&#13;
resumption of regular lending from the IFIs.&#13;
31.   Current Activities. Although IDA has not extended any credits to Afghanistan&#13;
since 1979, it has remained engaged with the assistance community. Efforts included&#13;
continuous monitoring of political and economic developments; managing selective&#13;
investments in the Afghan refugee communities; working closely with the UN and&#13;
donors; undertaking knowledge-building and knowledge-sharing activities; and providing&#13;
analytical and strategic depth for the work of the wider assistance community.5&#13;
B. The Transitional Support Strategy&#13;
32.   IDA's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which is being presented to the Board&#13;
with the proposed Project, is predicated on the need for well-coordinated efforts by&#13;
Afghanistan's development partners to realize Afghanistan's reconstruction and&#13;
development priorities. The key objectives of IDA's assistance over the next six to nine&#13;
months are to assist the authorities in establishing capacity in areas essential to facilitate&#13;
the reconstruction program; to support high-priority reconstruction activities that can also&#13;
help jump-starting economic activity; and to continue to build IDA's knowledge base&#13;
(including through the on-going comprehensive needs assessment) to allow for setting a&#13;
well-designed program of future assistance. In the near term, IDA's engagement with the&#13;
AIA is likely to be mainly at the central level, until such time when there is effective&#13;
decision-making at the sub-national level, and the countrywide security situation&#13;
improves. Consequently, to deliver assistance outside of Kabul, it will be vital to utilize&#13;
See Afghanistan: WorldBankApproach Paper, November 2001 for more details.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the experiences and networks of NGOs and UN agencies, and to develop mechanisms to&#13;
channel funds directly to community groups or traditional governance structures.&#13;
33.   Assistance to Afghanistan, for both recurrent and capital expenditures, is likely to&#13;
be received from various donors and delivered through a variety of mechanisms. Hence,&#13;
aid coordination will be essential to ensure a comprehensive and unified budget that is in&#13;
line with agreed national priorities. One mechanism to assist in such coordinated funding&#13;
is the multi-donor, IDA-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF)&#13;
that will provide financing for priority expenditures including recurrent costs. Donor&#13;
funding for recurrent expenditures, including wage payments, is an essential element of&#13;
the support needed since the scope for own-revenue collection is now very limited.&#13;
Figure 1 illustrates the coordinated flow of donor assistance that is envisaged.&#13;

C. Rationale for Early Grant Assistance&#13;
34.   Afghanistan has received generous pledges of donor support for its massive&#13;
reconstruction and development program. However, donors have also expressed strong&#13;
concern about the capacity of the authorities to effectively and transparently utilize this&#13;
assistance. It is imperative that the AIA and successor administrations have in place the&#13;
capacity to procure, disburse, account for, monitor, report on and audit the use of public&#13;
resources, including donor contributions. Past experience in post-conflict settings shows&#13;
that when procurement and fiduciary capacities are weak, bottlenecks to the&#13;
implementation of the reconstruction program arise.&#13;
35.   Consequently, it was decided to rapidly prepare this Project, which focuses on&#13;
these potential bottlenecks. The Project would enable the AIA to put in place capacity on&#13;
an emergency basis. It would also allow for the launching, without delay, of a medium-&#13;
term program of domestic capacity building. The potential benefits are large. First, the&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
creation of in-country procurement capacity and adequate fiduciary controls should&#13;
expedite the implementation of IDA operations, as well as assistance from other donors.&#13;
It should also help increase the transparency with which resources are used. Further, by&#13;
supporting basic steps towards developing the foundations for solid systems of&#13;
government procurement and financial management as well as payroll management, the&#13;
Project would also begin the process of laying the foundations for future activities&#13;
designed to support medium-term public sector reforms and institution building.&#13;
36.   A proposed second grant is expected to be presented to the Board for approval&#13;
before the end of the current fiscal year. This second grant would finance specific,&#13;
reconstruction activities that are currently under identification through an ongoing, multi-&#13;
sectoral needs assessment. The implementation of this larger grant and subsequent IDA&#13;
assistance is expected to benefit from capacity established under the current Project.&#13;
37.   Legal Basis for Assistance to Non-Accrual Member. Under IDA's Twelfth&#13;
Replenishment Resolution, IDA12 donor funds may be used for post-conflict grants&#13;
under the following conditions: (i) the proposed grant has been designed in accordance&#13;
with OP 2.30; (ii) early performance is promising as evidenced by the recipient country&#13;
having taken convincing steps towards social and economic recovery; (iii) arrears to&#13;
IBRD and/or IDA are large and protracted, and cannot be easily or quickly cleared using&#13;
domestic resources; (iv) a concerted international effort to provide positive financial&#13;
flows and other assistance is underway, and other creditors have agreed not to make net&#13;
withdrawals of financial resources from the country; and (v) alternative sources of&#13;
financing for post-conflict recovery are inadequate or available only on inappropriate&#13;
terms.&#13;
38.    With respect to the first two criteria, the proposed Grant has been designed in&#13;
accordance with OP 2.30, and, as described above, Afghanistan is in the midst of&#13;
establishing its path towards social and economic recovery. As for Afghanistan's arrears&#13;
to IDA, it has been in non-accrual since June 1992, with outstanding principal of&#13;
US$74.7 million and overdue principal and charges of US$25.2 million. In terms of&#13;
criterion (iii), these amounts are "large and protracted" compared with Afghanistan's&#13;
capability to service debt, and Afghanistan does not have domestic resources available to&#13;
clear them. As for the last two criteria: the proposed Grant would be the first step in&#13;
fulfilling the pledge by the World Bank Group institutions to contribute to the&#13;
international effort to assist Afghanistan; other multilateral creditors have agreed not to&#13;
make net withdrawals of financial resources prior to arrears clearance; bilateral creditors&#13;
are not expected to make net withdrawals; and alternative sources of funding are not&#13;
adequate to meet Afghanistan's needs in the immediate post-conflict period. Thus the&#13;
proposed grant is consistent with the adopted framework for IDA's provision of post-&#13;
conflict grant assistance.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
39.    The objective of the Project is to assist the AIA (and its successor) in putting in&#13;
place, on an emergency basis, capacity in key public administration areas to facilitate&#13;
better use of public resources, including donor funds, for urgent reconstruction and&#13;
development efforts. In addition, a secondary objective is to support some basic steps&#13;
towards laying the foundation for a transparent, well-functioning public administration.&#13;
40.   Success in meeting the objective will be measured by: the delivery of goods,&#13;
services and works in line with the agreed procurement plan in a transparent manner;&#13;
accurate accounting and timely reporting on budget execution, including detailed reports&#13;
submitted to donors (to the extent that their resources flow through the budget); and&#13;
published audits of budget execution for FY03 and FY04, including all on-going IDA&#13;
funded projects during that time period.&#13;
41.   Success in meeting the secondary objective will be measured by: preparation by&#13;
the authorities of action plans, satisfactory to IDA, for enhancing procurement, financial&#13;
management and audit rules, practices and capacity with an aim to transfer these&#13;
responsibilities to government institutions as rapidly as possible; and publication of&#13;
comprehensive, appropriately classified budgets for FY04 and FY05.&#13;
B. Project description&#13;
42.   The approach to reconstruction. The AIA's capacity is weak, yet there is a&#13;
large amount of aid that will need to be administered. Therefore, domestic capacity&#13;
building is a priority and must be started now. But in the interim, agile and transparent&#13;
implementation arrangements are needed. These arrangements need to be set up in a way&#13;
that facilitates long-term capacity building while meeting urgent needs. Accordingly, the&#13;
AIA has established a transitional Afghanistan Assistance Coordination Authority&#13;
(AACA), managed by a Director under the oversight of the Chairman of the AIA. The&#13;
AACA is expected to be dissolved when a permanent government is elected, and its&#13;
functions would be transferred to the regular ministries at that time. The AACA will&#13;
carry out a variety of functions including donor coordination and facilitation and&#13;
procurement, which will be contracted out to a specialized international firm.&#13;
Accounting functions, located within the Accounting and Treasury Departments of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, and audit functions, located in the Auditor General Office, will also&#13;
be contracted out to specialized international firms that will work closely with MOF and&#13;
AGO staff, respectively, until such time that a track record of accountability and&#13;
transparency can be established.&#13;
43.   The Grant will finance the employment by AIA of qualified firms to carry out, on&#13;
an interim basis, government procurement, financial management and audit functions on&#13;
behalf of the AlA; develop the administration's capacity; and assess existing systems and&#13;
procedures to recommend suitable policy reforms. Services will also be provided to&#13;
enhance aid coordination, strengthen payroll management and budget processes, and&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
develop capacity in economic policy formulation. In addition, resources are available to&#13;
fund studies and institution building within selected entities of the AIA. Figure 2&#13;
illustrates the main elements of technical assistance to be provided under the Project.&#13;
Annex II provides additional details.&#13;

Component 1: Support to the Afghanistan Assistance Coordination Authority&#13;
(US$4.25 million)&#13;
44.   The aim of this component is to provide support for the AACA to enable it to&#13;
carry out its responsibilities and discharge its functions as described in paragraph 42&#13;
above. It contributes to both project objectives.&#13;
(a) Procurement Strengthening (US$3.00 million). This sub-component seeks to&#13;
put in place emergency procurement capacity to facilitate rapid, transparent&#13;
utilization of donor resources for reconstruction and development. This will&#13;
be achieved by employing a specialized international firm (Procurement&#13;
Agent) for a two-year period. The Procurement Agent will work closely with&#13;
the staff of the AACA to ensure transfer of knowledge and development of&#13;
procurement capacity. The Procurement Agent will handle procurement for&#13;
all goods, works and services under operations financed directly by IDA, as&#13;
well as activities financed under the IDA-administered Afghanistan&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). In addition, the AIA has agreed that the&#13;
Agent will be used for budgetary expenditures from domestic resources.&#13;
Further, in order to streamline overall operations, the AIA has requested that&#13;
the Procurement Agent should be used for government-executed expenditures&#13;
funded by other donors.&#13;
The terms of reference for the Procurement Agent include: (i) building local&#13;
procurement capacity; and (ii) assessing existing laws, regulations, and&#13;
procedures, and developing a concrete action plan for enhancing the&#13;
procurement environment and building human capacity.&#13;
(b) Institutional Strengthening (US$0.65 million). This sub-component aims to&#13;
assist the AACA in developing its aid coordination and facilitation functions,&#13;
including funding for essential equipment and operating costs. This sub-&#13;
component also supports overall coordination and reporting efforts for this&#13;
Project.&#13;
(c) Studies and Targeted Institutional Strengthening (US$0.40 million). This sub-&#13;
component provides the AIA with flexibility to commission studies that could&#13;
generate quick impact or deal with key policy issues. Flexibility is designed&#13;
into this component in recognition of the rapidly changing environment. The&#13;
aim is to provide services to various ministries or agencies as may be&#13;
requested by the AIA.&#13;
(d) Training (US$0.20 million). A small allocation has been provided to allow&#13;
for provision of targeted training of key government staff in areas such as&#13;
computer technology and the English language, and seed money for&#13;
developing more extensive training programs that other donors may be willing&#13;
to finance.  It is important to note that the terms of reference for all&#13;
international assistance under this Project include a significant emphasis on&#13;
training and capacity building. Hence, this allocation should not be taken as&#13;
indicative of the support provided by the Project in these critical areas.&#13;
Component 2: Support to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(US$3.95 million)&#13;
45.   Post-conflict recovery and restoration of sustainable economic growth requires a&#13;
stable macroeconomic environment to underpin non-inflationary reconstruction. This&#13;
calls for strengthening economic management and restoring critical economic and&#13;
financial institutions. A sound budget is needed that is consistent with the agreed&#13;
recovery strategy and that is implemented through a comprehensive expenditure&#13;
management system. Initially most of the financing for the AIA (and its successor) will&#13;
come from donors. In order to provide accurate and meaningful information on&#13;
government spending, donor funds should appear in the budget and, to the extent feasible&#13;
and appropriate, flow through the Treasury. This will only be possible if donors are&#13;
assured of appropriate accountability in the management of these funds.  Thus&#13;
expenditure execution-including effective accountability, cash management and control,&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and comprehensive and accurate reporting-along with payroll management are high&#13;
priorities.&#13;
46.   In addition a broad budget framework is needed in order to begin to establish&#13;
priorities for the next budget and to determine the aggregate resource and expenditure&#13;
envelopes. One key area will be to determine a revised, fiscally sustainable wage bill,&#13;
predicated on a lean, merit-based civil service with a competitive wage structure.&#13;
47.   Consistent with the emergency nature of this operation, the support being&#13;
provided is at a basic level. It seeks to put in place emergency capacity, while laying&#13;
foundations on which to build sound institutions. Additional medium-term support will&#13;
be required. Several other partners are also likely to be involved in supporting the MOF.&#13;
IDA is currently working closely with the TMF, and IDA's support will be further tailored&#13;
to ensure complementarities with other resources to be provided. This component&#13;
contributes to both project objectives:&#13;
(a) Accounting and Treasury Department Strengthening (US$3.375 million).&#13;
This sub-component seeks to put in place emergency financial management&#13;
capacity to facilitate transparent accounting of governmental expenditures and&#13;
timely disbursements.  This will be done by employing a specialized&#13;
international firm (Financial Management Agent) for a two-year period (or&#13;
less should sufficient local capacity develop). In addition to developing and&#13;
operating an immediate stopgap financial management system (based on&#13;
existing policies and procedures) for AIA expenditures, the Financial&#13;
Management Agent-working with the MOF-will also assist in establishing&#13;
a simple, computerized expenditure management system that includes the&#13;
payroll. In the initial phase this will be limited to a consolidation of AIA&#13;
expenditures. In terms of the payroll, the focus will be on establishing clear&#13;
baseline data and monitoring changes to the payroll. Separate assistance is&#13;
provided to enhance controls over and implementation of the payroll. The&#13;
Financial Management Agent will work closely with the staff of the MOF to&#13;
ensure transfer of knowledge and development of capacity.&#13;
(b) Budget Department Strengthening (US$0.375 million). This sub-component&#13;
will provide consultants' services, equipment and operating costs needed to&#13;
strengthen the organizational structure of the department and to develop&#13;
selected functions. Technical assistance will also be provided in key areas&#13;
including: setting budget priorities, assessing recurrent cost implications of&#13;
the capital budget, defining a new salary scale, in line with budget envelopes,&#13;
and setting a new (temporary) pension rate, also in line with the budget&#13;
envelope.&#13;
(c) Economic Policy Strengthening (US$0.20 million). This sub-component will&#13;
provide consultants' services to begin building the capacity of the MOF to&#13;
carry out its function as the economic policy making organ of the AIA.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component 3: Support to the Auditor General Office&#13;
(US$1.80 million)&#13;
48.   While there is a certain capacity within AGO, it is insufficient to meet the needs&#13;
of the AIA and donor community. This component will provide immediate support. In&#13;
addition the AGO will be seeking to establish a twinning partnership with a qualified&#13;
Supreme Audit Institution. The aim of this component is to enhance the capacity of the&#13;
AGO to fulfill its responsibilities as the AIA audit institution. It supports both objectives&#13;
of the project.&#13;
(a) Audit Capacity Strengthening (US$1.80 million). This component seeks to&#13;
put in place emergency audit capacity to ensure the timely audit of budget&#13;
execution, which will be largely donor-financed. This will be done by&#13;
employing a specialized international firm (Audit Agent) for a two-year&#13;
period. The Audit Agent will work closely with the staff of the AGO to&#13;
transfer necessary knowledge and develop audit capacity. The Audit Agent&#13;
will work with the AGO to audit AIA budget execution. Further, in order to&#13;
streamline overall operations, the AIA has requested that the Audit Agent&#13;
should be used by other donors, in line with their contributions flowing&#13;
through the budget. This Agent will be used to audit IDA financed projects.&#13;
The terms of reference for the Audit Agent also include: (i) building local&#13;
audit capacity; and (ii) assessing existing laws, regulations, procedures, and&#13;
capacity and developing a concrete action plan for enhancing the audit&#13;
function and building human capacity. The component also includes a small&#13;
allocation for equipment and operating costs.&#13;
C. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
49.   Project Sequencing. There is currently limited implementation capacity within&#13;
the AIA. It is for that reason that the Project is assisting in putting in place on an&#13;
emergency basis procurement, financial management and audit capacity. The selection&#13;
of these Agents has commenced, consistent with IDA procurement guidelines. It is&#13;
expected that the Agents would be in place by May 1, 2002, thereby allowing for&#13;
immediate Project start-up. To fulfill urgent needs, the Financial Management and&#13;
Procurement Agents may be requested to provide interim assistance to the AIA&#13;
immediately after their selection. This is the most urgent priority, and as such the first&#13;
stage of the project start-up will focus on ensuring that these Agents are in place. Given&#13;
limited implementationi capacity, it is only once these Agents are in place that attention&#13;
will turn to a rapid start-up of the other Project sub-components.&#13;
50.   Implementation Arrangements. The Project has three implementing agencies&#13;
Component 1 will be implemented by the AACA. Component 2 will be implemented by&#13;
the MOF. Component 3 will be implemented by the AGO. Responsibility for&#13;
coordinated reporting on Project implementation will rest with the AACA. While three&#13;
implementing agencies may seem high for an emergency operation, it is deemed&#13;
appropriate. This is because it is essential to begin building capacity in relevant domestic&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
institutions so that they can assume their responsibilities as rapidly as possible. Further,&#13;
vesting procurement with the AACA actually streamlines implementation of the overall&#13;
reconstruction program by focusing this activity within one agency. Given the fluid&#13;
environment, and the fact that the AACA is a new institution, spreading implementation&#13;
also helps to diffuse risk that would exist by vesting all implementation in a single entity.&#13;
51.   Given that the Project also emphasizes capacity building, AIA will identify and&#13;
appoint an adequate number of civil service counterparts with sufficient qualifications to&#13;
work with the firms that will be providing services.&#13;
52.   Procurement. Procurement responsibility under the project would be primarily&#13;
carried out by a specialized firm (Procurement Agent) contracted specifically to work, on&#13;
behalf of, and closely with, staff of the AACA and other line ministries. This&#13;
arrangement of having a specialized firm in place as early as possible would ensure&#13;
compliance with IDA procurement procedures from the outset, and expedite&#13;
implementation of Project activities.&#13;
53.   The three Agents, covering the Procurement, Financial Management, and Audit&#13;
core technical assistance functions on behalf of the AIA are being selected based on&#13;
Consultant's Qualifications. The Procurement Agent anchored in the AACA for this&#13;
purpose will handle all other procurement. The implementing agencies would provide&#13;
technical input into the process, however they would not be responsible for any&#13;
procurement actions during the course of the project. To ensure domestic capacity is built&#13;
up, the Procurement Agent will provide training to AACA staff, as well as key&#13;
counterpart staff in other line ministries as deemed necessary to ensure that they develop&#13;
capacity to carry out procurement on their own, and will also assist in preparing the&#13;
AIA's global procurement strategic plan for the next two years. Annex III provides more&#13;
information on procurement arrangements.&#13;
54.   Disbursement and Financial Management Arrangements. Since there is no&#13;
Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country Financial Accountability&#13;
Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate knowledge of country issues&#13;
and related strengths and weaknesses. Hence, for this emergency operation, it is assumed&#13;
that financial management capacity in the country is negligible and appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures have been built in to the Project. A Financial Management Agent is&#13;
being recruited as part of the Project to strengthen the AIA's financial management&#13;
capacity, including for the Grant proceeds. The Financial Management Agent will be&#13;
responsible for assisting the MOF to maintain the Project accounts and prepare Project&#13;
financial statements. These arrangements are adequate to account for and report on Grant&#13;
expenditures. Additional details are available in Annex IV.&#13;
55.   Disbursements: Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be made in the&#13;
traditional system (reimbursement with full documentation and against statements of&#13;
expenditure). Due to the nature of the Project activities, this Project will have a relatively&#13;
small number of payments. Initial payments will be made directly by IDA, and the&#13;
Special Account would only be established once adequate banking arrangements are in&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
place. Disbursement for operating expenditures and goods will only be made after the&#13;
Financial Management Agent is employed to carry out sub-component 2a of the Project.&#13;
56.   Audit: The Audit Agent will audit the accounts of the Project. The annual Project&#13;
financial statements audited by external auditors would be submitted within 6 months of&#13;
the close of AIA's fiscal year.&#13;
57.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of approximately&#13;
US$500,000 will be available to finance consultant services of the Financial Management&#13;
Agent and the Procurement Agent provided between March 15, 2002 and singing of the&#13;
Grant.&#13;
58.   Monitoring and Evaluation.   Monitoring arrangements include plans for&#13;
intensive supervision by IDA to ensure that any implementation difficulties are dealt with&#13;
promptly. At a minimum, a full supervision mission is needed quarterly, with specialists&#13;
visiting Afghanistan more frequently if needed during Project implementation. In&#13;
addition, particularly since a significant portion of the project (75 percent of total&#13;
resources) are to hire procurement, financial management and audit agents that will also&#13;
be used by other IDA projects, preparation and supervision missions for other operations&#13;
will also be used as opportunities to monitor progress in these areas. IDA will also carry&#13;
out a mid-term performance review. A quarterly progress report will be prepared and&#13;
submitted to IDA, which consolidates all components including progress towards&#13;
meeting implementation and development objectives, as further detailed in the Project's&#13;
procurement plan and detailed monitoring indicators. Responsibility for this reporting&#13;
rests with the AACA, with each implementing agency agreeing to provide requisite input.&#13;
Annex V provides additional details on monitoring indicators for the Project.&#13;
D. Justification&#13;
59.   The AIA does not have an established track record of transparent and efficient&#13;
implementation. This severely limits the scope for successful implementation of a large&#13;
recovery program.  Further, concerns about accountability could jeopardize the&#13;
magnitude of donor support that has been pledged and will be required. Assisting the&#13;
AIA (and its successor) in building a nucleus of implementation capacity (in&#13;
procurement, financial management and audit) and showing credible results on the&#13;
ground will help the AIA (and its successor) start building a track record of performance,&#13;
while also providing some assurance to donors of appropriate fiduciary accountability for&#13;
budget resources. The additional activities supported by the Project begin to lay key&#13;
foundations in selected areas of the public administration. Although public sector&#13;
enhancement is a medium-term objective, it is crucial to set the tone in the short-term&#13;
with effective support initial steps in this process.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I: ADDITIONAL GOVERNANCE BACKGROUND&#13;
Governance Principles. Four over-arching governance principles for a rebuilding and&#13;
reunifying Afghanistan can be distilled from the various documentation and discussions&#13;
at recent international gatherings.&#13;
The first principle is that the role of the new Afghan state should in the foreseeable future&#13;
be focused on the inherently governmental functions of:&#13;
1. Assuring order and public safety;&#13;
2. Providing for peaceable and open political and economic relations with all&#13;
neighboring states;&#13;
3. Reducing economic distance within the country (both the cost of physical transfer&#13;
of goods and services, and the flow of relevant information);&#13;
4. Encouraging the growth of competitive goods and factor markets partly through&#13;
facilitating information and communication;&#13;
5. Exercising strong aggregate financial and (eventually) monetary control;&#13;
6. Providing a stable medium of exchange;&#13;
7. Advancing the rule of law; and&#13;
8. Protecting the most vulnerable groups.&#13;
Second, a realistic balance of powers and responsibilities between central and local&#13;
governments is necessary to achieve decentralization without disintegration. This is&#13;
possible in Afghanistan only if the central government limits its activity to these essential&#13;
national functions, and if it selects a mode of implementation that recognizes the&#13;
importance of providing an enabling environment for local community participation. The&#13;
likely balance is:&#13;
1. Sharing the service policy and standard-setting function between center and local&#13;
government in a manner suitable to the specific sector;&#13;
2. Reserving service delivery largely to local government structures and/or to the&#13;
private sector or NGOs; and&#13;
3. Reserving service financing almost entirely to the central government (through&#13;
which most external aid should be channeled).&#13;
Third, corruption should be minimized without hampering effective action. This will&#13;
require that:&#13;
1. Government regulation should be kept to the minimum necessary to protect a&#13;
demonstrable public interest;&#13;
2. Transparency should be aggressively pursued in all governmental activities;&#13;
3. Government employees should be paid well enough that they do not have to steal&#13;
in order to live; and&#13;
4. Penalties should be swift, certain, and publicly enforced.&#13;
Finally, it is important to work with the grain of existing institutional arrangements.&#13;
Afghanistan is not an institutional tabula rasa-the weaknesses in the public sector&#13;
institutional arrangements do not amount to a blank slate. There are basic laws and&#13;
procedures that were functioning during the period of the late President Daoud, during&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Soviet occupation, during the mujahideen period and even under the Taliban regime.&#13;
Some administrative functions continued to be performed and many mid-level and lower-&#13;
level cadre government employees have remained in their jobs. This is both good and&#13;
bad as many elements of the central planning model that had been imposed on&#13;
Afghanistan by the Soviet Union remain in place. However great the need for a fresh&#13;
start, there is a need to work with these existing institutional realities.&#13;
Structure of the AIA. The AIA is entrusted with the day-to-day conduct of the affairs&#13;
of state and has the right to issue decrees "for the peace, order and good government of&#13;
Afghanistan." It is composed by a Chairman, five Vice Chairmen and 24 other members.&#13;
Each member, except the Chairman, may head a department. Decisions can be taken (if&#13;
possible by consensus, but if not by a majority) when at least 22 members are in&#13;
attendance. The AIA is charged with establishing a Central Bank (to regulate the money&#13;
supply of the country through transparent and accountable procedures), an independent&#13;
Civil Service Commission (to provide the AIA and its successor with shortlists of&#13;
candidates for key governmental posts), and an independent Human Rights Commission&#13;
(to monitor human rights, investigate violations, and develop domestic human rights&#13;
institutions).&#13;
Civil service size. In Afghanistan, the civil service comprises the core civil service&#13;
deployed in Kabul and provinces as well as employees of state owned enterprises. Based&#13;
on the organizational chart of government from the 1970s, the MOF estimates that there&#13;
are 219,000 sanctioned posts, but no information exists about how many employees are&#13;
deployed between Kabul and the provinces, between the core civil service and&#13;
enterprises, or in the different grades. Current estimates of the shape of the civil service&#13;
are necessarily extrapolations from the last recorded (1996 - Kabul only) number of civil&#13;
servants employed in ministries in 12 grades.&#13;

Civil service compensation. Civil service compensation is very compressed. This is a&#13;
result of the fact that the bulk of compensation derives from a uniform food allowance.&#13;
Compensation rates, for each of the twelve grades, are summarized in the table below.&#13;

ANNEX III: PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Institutional Capacity&#13;
This Project has three components: Component 1: Support to the Afghanistan&#13;
Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA) (US$4.25 million); Component 2: Support to&#13;
Ministry of Finance (US$3.95 million); and Component 3: Support to Auditor General&#13;
Office (US$ 1.80 million). As this Project itself is for institution building, based on the&#13;
request of Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA), it is envisaged that IDA initially&#13;
would provide limited support to AACA till a procurement agent is put in place. The&#13;
hiring of the Procurement Agent is part of Component 1.&#13;
The Procurement Agent will work on behalf of, and closely with, the staff of&#13;
AACA and other ministries. The Procurement Agent will be responsible for procurement&#13;
of goods, works and consultancy services and for building capacity within AACA and&#13;
line ministries. IDA would arrange for training of key AACA staff to become familiar&#13;
with IDA procurement guidelines and procedures. AACA will appoint a counterpart staff&#13;
who, supported by IDA, would be involved in the selection of Procurement Agent.&#13;
In view of the post-conflict envirorment in the country, the procurement risk is&#13;
considered high, despite use of procurement expertise of the specialized firm&#13;
(Procurement Agent) in the AACA. Project supervision will include procurement&#13;
expertise in most missions over the life of the IDA Grant. Threshold limits described&#13;
below have been set considering these risks.&#13;
B. Procurement Methods&#13;
The procurement arrangements and the estimated costs for the Project&#13;
components to be funded by IDA are shown in Table A. Procurement under the IDA&#13;
Grant would be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 and&#13;
September 1997and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised in September 1997 and&#13;
January 1999). The "Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of Consultants"&#13;
(July 1997, revised April 1998 and July 1999) would be used for consulting services.&#13;
Bl: Procurement of Goods (US$600, 000)&#13;
The procurement of goods will consist of office supplies and equipment,&#13;
including  computers  and  vehicles.  Limited  International Bidding  (LIB),&#13;
International/National Shopping Procedures (IS/NS), Procurement through UN&#13;
Procurement Agency (UN Procurement) and Direct Contracting (DC) procedures will be&#13;
used.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Limited Intemational Bidding (LIB): This will be used for goods estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$200,000 or equivalent per contract. Bidders could send their request&#13;
by fax and no bid security would be required.&#13;
International/National Shopping (IS/NS): This will be used for goods estimated&#13;
to cost less than or equal to US$200,000 equivalent per contract. Under Shopping&#13;
procedures, the Procurement Agent will use simplified documents and procedures for&#13;
soliciting, receiving and evaluating competitive quotation from usually at least three&#13;
suppliers (in International Shopping from two different countries). Shopping method to&#13;
be used will be based on Bank's memorandum of June 8, 2000 (Guidance Procurement&#13;
Notes on Handling Procurement under Shopping Methods). In view of the nature of this&#13;
emergency operations, the threshold will be higher than normal limit of US$100,000.&#13;
Procurement through UN Procurement Agency (UN Procurement): This will be&#13;
used for goods estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 or equivalent per contract, with&#13;
the UN acting as suppliers pursuant to their own procedures.&#13;
Direct Contracting (DC) Procedures: This will be used for goods estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$50,000 or equivalent per contract.&#13;
B2: Consulting Services and Training (US$9 million):&#13;
Although for consulting services the preferred selection method is Quality and&#13;
Cost Based Selection (QCBS), for the three major consultancies (Procurement Agent,&#13;
Financial Management Agent and Audit Agent) that need to be selected as quickly as&#13;
possible, the method to be used is Selection Based on Consultants' Qualification (CQ).&#13;
This means seeking Expressions of Interest (EOIs) based on brief terms of reference, and&#13;
specifying in the EOIs the criteria for establishing a shortlist with a view to select the&#13;
firm with the most appropriate qualifications and references. The selected firm will be&#13;
asked to submit a combined technical-financial proposal before being invited for&#13;
negotiations. The EOIs for the above three Agents were published in the UNDB online&#13;
version on February 23, 2002 along with other targeted announcements to ensure wide&#13;
dissemination. For major consultancies the description, estimated cost and method of&#13;
selection are as follows:&#13;

5.    Technical Assistance and Support to&#13;
Ministry of Finance including:&#13;
(a) Payroll Management Strengthening  US$0.20 million  QCBS&#13;
(b) Budget Department Strengthening  US$0.20 million  QCBS&#13;
(c) Economic Policy Strengthening  US$0.20 million  QCBS/QBS/CQ/SS/Ind&#13;
The above consultancies may also include supply of goods of about 15 percent of&#13;
the value of consultancy to be brought by the consultants for their use during the course&#13;
of assignment and to be left with the client, after its use.&#13;
IDA's clearance of terms of reference and single source selections will be&#13;
mandatory irrespective of value of the assignment.&#13;
C. Procurement Planning&#13;
The AIA, with limited support from IDA, is expected to hire the three agents&#13;
(Procurement, Financial Management and Audit) by May 2002. A work plan in this&#13;
respect was agreed with AIA during negotiations. Once the Procurement Agent is in&#13;
place, one of its first tasks would be to forward for IDA's review a procurement plan for&#13;
the Project.&#13;
D. Prior and Post Review&#13;
All contracts for goods in excess of US$100,000 each and consulting services&#13;
contracts above US$100,000 for firms and above US$50,000 for individual consultants,&#13;
would be subject to prior review by IDA. The prior review process would also cover the&#13;
first three goods contracts, irrespective of the amount. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to post-review on a random basis during supervision missions and audits.&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
E. Procurement Information&#13;
The Procurement Agent will prepare procurement information that will be&#13;
collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
1. prompt reporting of contract award information for the respective components; and&#13;
2. comprehensive quarterly reports prepared by AACA indicating:&#13;
*     revised cost estimates for individual contracts and total cost;&#13;
*     revised timings of procurement actions including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
*     compliance report by AACA within three months of the Grant signing&#13;
date.&#13;

ANNEX IV: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT &amp; DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
Since there is no Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country&#13;
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate&#13;
knowledge of country issues and related strengths and weaknesses.     Financial&#13;
management capacity in the country is considered to be negligible and appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures have been suggested through the engagement of the Financial&#13;
Management Agent.&#13;
Risk Analysis&#13;
Risk                Rating          Risk Mitigation Measure&#13;
Project implementation will be coordinated  H  The Financial Management Agent will support&#13;
by a newly established agency and the    the disbursement of funds, accounting and&#13;
country's financial management systems   reporting.  There will also be monitoring&#13;

inherent risks that the funds: (a) may not be  arrangements. The AIA has expressed its strong&#13;
accounted for properly; or (b) may be    commitment to accountable and transparent&#13;
misused or misappropriated.              financial management arrangements.&#13;
Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
Strengths: The engagement of the Financial Management Agent, along with the&#13;
AIA's commitment to transparent and accountable financial management, are the primary&#13;
strengths of the Project financial management.&#13;
Significant weaknesses: The country's financial management system is not&#13;
functioning effectively. Engaging the Financial Management Agent mitigates this risk;&#13;
its responsibilities will include accounting for and reporting on Project expenditures.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
Once appropriate banking facilities are available, IDA funds will be deposited in a&#13;
special account and Project transactions will be routed through this account. Until the&#13;
Special Account is opened, payments to the consultants will be made directly by IDA.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
Since the financial management capacity of the implementing agencies is clearly&#13;
not adequate, the Financial Management Agent (to be recruited through the Project) will&#13;
support the MOF to perform the necessary financial management functions. MOF&#13;
counterparts are available to work closely with the Agent. One of the critical functions of&#13;
the Financial Management Agent will be to provide hands-on support to implementing&#13;
agency staff to enhance their financial management capacity.&#13;

Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
The Project will follow standard AIA financial management policies and&#13;
procedures, including using the AIA Chart of Accounts to record Project expenditures.&#13;
The use of these procedures will allow for adequate recording and reporting of Project&#13;
expenditures&#13;
Accounts will be maintained centrally in the MOF (by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent) for all implementing entities and consolidated Project financial statements will be&#13;
prepared for all sources and uses of Project funds.&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Audit Agent with terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project financial statement to the&#13;
Association would include a summary of funds received (showing funds received from&#13;
all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/&#13;
activities and by main categories of expenditures. The format of the annual Project&#13;
financial statements will be similar to the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The&#13;
audit of the Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy of the&#13;
accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate&#13;
documentation for transactions; and (c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for&#13;
Association financing. The annual Project financial statements audited by the Audit&#13;
Agent would be submitted within 6 months of the close of AIA's fiscal year. The&#13;
following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit Reports Compliance System&#13;
(ARCS):&#13;
Responsible Agency       | Audit                  | Auditors&#13;
AACA                      SOE, Project Accounts and  Audit Agent&#13;
Special Account&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i) sources and&#13;
uses of funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii) physical progress;&#13;
and (iii) status of procurement activities. These will be submitted to the Association&#13;
within 45 days of the end of the quarter.&#13;

Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Allocation of Grant Proceeds&#13;
Expenditure Category     Amount       Financing&#13;
US$       Percentage&#13;
Consultants &amp; Training     9,000,000   100%&#13;
Goods                        600,000   100%&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs  400,000   100%&#13;
Total Project Costs       10,000,000&#13;
Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-&#13;
based (replenishment and reimbursement with full documentation and against statement&#13;
of expenditure).&#13;
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the&#13;
basis of SOEs for: (a) consultants and training for contracts not exceeding US$100,000&#13;
for firms and US$50,000 for individuals; and (b) goods for contract not exceeding&#13;
US$100,000; and (c) incremental operating costs.&#13;
Special Account. A Special Account would be maintained in a bank acceptable to&#13;
the Association; and would be operated by MOF. The Special Account would be&#13;
operated in accordance with the Association's operational policies. The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Special Account would be US$1 million that represents about 4 months&#13;
of initial estimated disbursements from the IDA Grant. The authorized allocation of the&#13;
Special Account will be US$200,000 until cumulative disbursements from the Credit&#13;
reach SDR 2.5 million.&#13;
Due to the lack of banking facilities to maintain the Special Account, initial&#13;
payments to consultants will be direct payments by the Association. As soon as adequate&#13;
banking facilities are available, the Special Account can be opened and used to make&#13;
payments for Project expenditures.&#13;
MOF will submit withdrawal applications to the Association for replenishment of&#13;
the special account or reimbursement.&#13;
Conditions&#13;
Disbursements.  Disbursement for the Goods and Operating Expenditures&#13;
categories will only take place once the Financial Management Agent is in place.&#13;
Financial Covenants&#13;
(a) AIA shall submit to IDA audited financial statements within 6 months of the end&#13;
of each fiscal year.&#13;
33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b) AIA shall establish and operate no later than June 30, 2002, and thereafter&#13;
maintain throughout the Project implementation period, a satisfactory financial&#13;
management system, in accordance with the financial management manual agreed&#13;
with IDA. This will be achieved through the engagement of the Financial&#13;
Management Agent.&#13;
(c) Financial Monitoring Reports will be submitted on a quarterly basis.&#13;
(d) Audit of the Special Account, SOEs and the Project financial statements will be&#13;
performed in accordance with terms of reference agreed with the Association.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive&#13;
quarterly supervision. The focus during the supervision will be on the internal control&#13;
arrangements for the Project and functioning of accounting, financial reporting and&#13;
auditing.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Emergency Public
            Administration Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Public
            Administration Project for Afghanistan is to assist the
            Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA)(and its successor)
            in putting in place, on an emergency basis, capacity in key
            public administration areas to facilitate better use of
            public resources, including donor funds, for urgent
            reconstruction and development efforts. In addition, a
            secondary objective is to support some basic steps towards
            laying the foundation for a transparent, well-functioning
            public administration. The Grant will finance the employment
            by AIA of qualified firms to work with AIA officials to
            carry out, on an interim basis, government procurement,
            financial management and audit functions on behalf of the
            AIA; develop the administration's capacity; and assess
            existing systems and procedures to recommend suitable policy
            reforms. Services will also be provided to enhance aid
            coordination, strengthen payroll management and budget
            processes, and develop capacity in economic policy
            formulation. In addition, resources are available to fund
            studies and institution building within selected entities of
            the AIA.
