&amp;#12;COUNTRY, SECTOR AND PROGRAM BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Afghanistan was devastated by three decades o f conflict which destroyed physical and&#13;
institutional structures and tore the social fabric o f the nation. The education and training infrastructure in&#13;
the country was at the frontline o f this devastation both in terms o f physical infrastructure and ideology.&#13;
The situation reached i t s lowest point under the Taliban regime.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Since the ousting o f the Taliban in 2002, the Government o f Afghanistan (GOA) has begun to&#13;
formulate new policies and rebuild institutions. The social sectors have been placed at the top o f the&#13;
reconstruction agenda o f the country with particular emphasis given to education, training and slulls&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The first four years o f reconstruction have been marked by significant developments in political,&#13;
economic and social spheres despite the worsening security situation in parts o f the country. Elections,&#13;
which witnessed larger turnouts than even before in the history o f the country (particularly female),&#13;
brought in a parliament, with representation from a wide spectrum o f society. Economic growth has been&#13;
vigorous with the real value o f GDP (excluding illicit opium production) increasing by about 29% in&#13;
2002, 16% in 2003,8% in 2004, 14% in 2005, and 8.0% in 2006, albeit from a l o w base in 2002 (IMF&#13;
2007). Most o f this growth was fueled by a significant influx o f foreign capital for reconstruction. O n the&#13;
social front, access to health care (including immunization services and pre- and post-natal care) and&#13;
school services have improved significantly during this period. School enrollments have increased from&#13;
about 1 million to nearly 6 million since 2002, with enrolments o f girls increasing to about 35% o f this&#13;
total from a negligible base.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Despite these impressive strides, Afghanistan remains at a critical stage in i t s transition, facing&#13;
numerous challenges: institutionalization o f the political system, concerns o f security and the r u l e o f law,&#13;
weak institutional capacity, a lack o f defined market structures, poorly skilled labor force, non-&#13;
responsiveness o f the s k i l l and capacity-building infrastructure to market demands, and persistent poverty&#13;
(annual per capita GDP 300 U S $ in 2005/06)'.&#13;
&#13;
5.       As a key step in responding to these challenges, especially in the area o f l o w capacity o f the labor&#13;
force, G O A has requested the World Bank for technical and financial assistance in the area o f Technical&#13;
Vocational Education and Training (TVET). T h i s request was aimed at improving the s k i l l levels and&#13;
educational profile o f the country's human resource, while simultaneously laying the policy and&#13;
institutional framework for further human resource development. The Bank developed a policy note in&#13;
2006 entitled `Skills Development in Afghanistan' in response to the GOA'Srequest and the proposed&#13;
project builds on the findings therein.&#13;
&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
&#13;
Supplv Issues&#13;
&#13;
6.      The present TVET system's ability to meet the s k i l l demands referred above depends on two&#13;
elements: (i) current and future educational profile o f labor market participants and entrants (i.e., the&#13;
               the&#13;
trainability o f the labor force) which will condition the type o f training to be provided (e.g., remedial;&#13;
broad scoped; specialized) and affect the means o f access (formal or non-formal), and (ii) ability o f&#13;
                                                                                                 the&#13;

                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;existing technical, vocational education and training providers, both public and non-public, to do so&#13;
efficiently and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
                    f&#13;
Human capital base o the current and potential labor force&#13;
&#13;
7.         The current education profile o f adults i s low. Adult literacy (ages 15-49) i s very low, with&#13;
 estimates o f male and female literacy at about 43% and 13% respectively. Educational attainment, as&#13;
measured by years o f schooling o f the population, i s also extremely l o w with school life expectancy o f&#13;
j u s t over two years for the 2001/02 school year (Global Education Digest, 2004), and less than 1 year for&#13;
 girls2.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Though the potential number o f labor market entrants with basic literacy and numeracy slulls i s&#13;
expected to increase over the medium- to long-term as schooling cohorts have grown in size in recent&#13;
years3, in the short-term the majority o f participants will continue to display l o w literacy and numeracy&#13;
skills. This will continue to hamper the supply o f skilled labor needed for reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation activities.&#13;
&#13;
Thepotential o TVET to meet skill demands&#13;
              f&#13;
&#13;
9.       The existing TVET system has little capacity to train current participants or prepare new entrants&#13;
for the labor force with the needed s k i l l sets. Four factors contribute to this inability to provide the&#13;
requisite training: (i) l o w number o f opportunities for training, (ii) poor quality o f existing&#13;
                       the                                                    the&#13;
training, (iii)relevance o f training to the needs o f the labor market, and (iv) weak institutional&#13;
arrangements for planning, managing, regulating and financing o f training opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
 10.      Provision: TVET provision occurs through both public and private institutions in Afghanistan.&#13;
Table 1 summarizes the array o f current training opportunities and their providers. An indeterminate, but&#13;
perhaps the largest, number o f trainees acquire skills through informal apprenticeships offered by small&#13;
and micro enterprises. Very l i t t l e information i s available on the how these apprenticeship programs are&#13;
developed and implemented, but most use private channels to access them. Under the more formal set-&#13;
up, two ministries play a critical role in the provision o f TVET: (i) Department o f Vocational&#13;
                                                                           the&#13;
Education under Ministry o f Education (DTVET) under the MOE which oversees vocational education at&#13;
a post-Grade 9 level through about 45 centers around the country; and (ii) vocational training&#13;
                                                                                 the&#13;
programs under the MOLSAMD, which manages 18 vocational training centers, and with the support o f&#13;
the NSDP facilitates training programs in numerous other centers around the country. Given the large&#13;
presence o f NGOs, NGOs too play an important role in the provision o f training directly, or through&#13;
facilitation by various government entities. Given the overall lack o f capacity within government it i s&#13;
expected that NGOs will continue to play an important role in the provision o f training services in the&#13;
short- to medium terms. There i s a small but growing private sector in training in the country4 and efforts&#13;
need to be focused on developing the needed mechanisms to improve the opportunities for private&#13;
training. This private training opportunity i s particularly dominant in English Language and Computer&#13;
Literacy training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Afghanistan's school life expectancy i s the lowest in the w o r l d and in the region Bangladesh and Pakistan have&#13;
life-expectancies o f 1.8 years and 2.5 years respectively for girls.&#13;
   These gains mask considerable system-wide inequities, for example, girls and women are under-represented in the&#13;
schooling system. This i s m u c h more so in the formal and general schooling system, than in non-formal training&#13;
mostly delivered by NGOs, where women's participation is often mandated by the provider.&#13;
   The Afghanistan T e c h c a l Vocational Institute i s one example o f such a nascent and growing private sector,&#13;
established through public private partnership arrangements and managed privately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 I 1.    Quality: The quality o f current TVET provision i s generally poor. Training access i s both formal&#13;
and non-formal, which to some extent depends upon the level at which training services are pitched with&#13;
higher level programs typically being more formal in provision. Typical programs are plagued by high&#13;
number o f trainees to trainer ratio, time-based programs and not programs that are based on competencies&#13;
acquired, given the lack o f limited resources, most training tends to be theoretical and not applied,&#13;
teaching tends to be rote in nature, finally, the infrastructure for training i s dilapidated, with obsolete and&#13;
non-functioning equipment the norm. The poor quality o f these inputs i s further compounded by the very&#13;
l o w academic levels o f entrants to training programs given the poor quality or complete lack o f prior&#13;
schooling, leaving most o f them with little literacy and numeracy skills. The complete absence o f&#13;
mechanisms for quality control (either an accreditation system for the providers or a qualifications&#13;
framework for the establishment and adoption o f curriculum reforms). This makes it difficult for&#13;
employers to gauge the competencies o f people seeking employment.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Relevance: The relevance o f publicly-provided TVET i s undermined because courses offered&#13;
have little to n o relationship with the needs o f the labor market. The system i s very supply driven and&#13;
provides the wrong incentives for participation in training programs. The curriculum in many trades tends&#13;
to be overly theoretical, outdated, and has few links to the realities o f the workplace. Industry, private&#13;
sector and the public sector have little input in the formation o f curriculum or courses and this results in&#13;
choosing training sectors on the basis o f tradition rather than any analysis o f the economic environment.&#13;
As a consequence curriculum development and standardization i s very limited, essentially focused on the&#13;
pre-determined trades. It appears that training provided by NGOs i s more closely linked to s k i l l demands&#13;
given the decentralized manner o f implementation. However, a lack o f training standards makes it&#13;
difficult to assess competencies and limits the ability o f the worker to change jobs. The information&#13;
system (monitoring and evaluation; research) does not contribute to decision making by individuals on&#13;
the options that are available to them for training. The most effective information system i s private&#13;
channels. These are limited in their ability to provide an over-all picture o f trends and developments that&#13;
could inform beneficiaries o f the menu o f options available and the likelihood o f returns from various&#13;
training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 M a n y o f these apprentices are underage - an issue that needs to be addressed through a comprehensive education&#13;
and social policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            3&#13;
&amp;#12;13.      Institutional Structures: Afghanistan currently possesses a number o f institutions which are&#13;
concerned with Technical and Vocational Education and Training. However, the roles and responsibilities&#13;
o f these institutions need to be more clearly defined and the expected outcomes need to be better&#13;
articulated. The existing institutional underpinning o f the TVET system fails also to recognize and sustain&#13;
the crucial link o f specific demand to supply o f specific, quality skills. There i s poor coordination across&#13;
public providers in terms o f what their exact roles and responsibilities are, and what they should be. This&#13;
fragmentation o f responsibilities further reduces the efficiency o f the use o f available resources, as&#13;
organizations tend to duplicate efforts.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Another key limitation o f the current system i s that there are very few opportunities for public&#13;
training providers to experiment and configure their training to labor market needs. This i s because these&#13;
institutions are severely constrained in their functioning by a highly centralized administrative mechanism&#13;
and lack o f operational and financial autonomy. This l i m i t s the opportunities for partnerships to leverage&#13;
the strengths o f the private sector in planning and delivering demand-driven training programs.&#13;
&#13;
15.      The legislative framework for TVET provision in the country helps to support and maintain the&#13;
                                             n&#13;
current supply driven system o f training. I i t s current form, it does not allow for the inclusion and&#13;
participation o f industry and the private sector in many o f the decisions made regarding the sector. The&#13;
current system does not provide legal recognition for implementing agencies, and does not help promote&#13;
private and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) provision o f training using public resources. Finally,&#13;
the existing legislation centralizes financing mechanisms, restricts decision making at the level o f the&#13;
training provider, and offers n o incentives for new approaches and training modules to be experimented&#13;
with and for putting in place training programs that are demand-driven. T h i s limits the possibility o f cost-&#13;
recovery or cost-sharing, and eventually developing sustainable, cost-effective training programs.&#13;
&#13;
Demand Issues&#13;
&#13;
16.      Demand side issues pertain to recent trends in the economy, the structure o f the labor market, and&#13;
economic growth prospects to assess the h t u r e demand for slulls. There has been significant growth in&#13;
the last four years as mentioned earlier, but this has not led to changes in the structure o f the economy.&#13;
The primary sector (of agriculture and mining) continues to dominate the secondary and tertiary sectors&#13;
(of industry and construction, trade and services). Agriculture has been driving growth in rural parts o f the&#13;
country while construction, trade and services have been spurring urban growth.&#13;
&#13;
17.      In terms o f the labor market structure, it i s estimated that 80 to 90 % o f economic activity i s&#13;
informal in nature consisting mostly o f small, family-owned enterprises which are typically characterized&#13;
as being labor-intensive and o f l o w productivity. Formal sector employment i s largely public, though&#13;
there has been undocumented growth in the private sector since 2002, particularly in the form o f small&#13;
and medium enterprises. Additionally, aid agencies and NGOs which play an important role in&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction, also account for a significant portion o f formal sector employment.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     Reliable estimates o f unemployment rates, identification o f s k i l l s gaps and mismatches,&#13;
development o f detailed labor market needs, etc., are difficult in Afghanistan, given the overall lack o f&#13;
credible statistical information. Years o f conflict, consequent economic instability and flux in the labor&#13;
force since 2002 with large internal movement o f displaced persons, make it difficult to estimate key&#13;
indicators as mentioned above. However, evidence from localized surveys suggests an increasing demand&#13;
for skilled and semi-skilled labor. There i s widespread perception among policy makers that the demand&#13;
for skilled labor i s currently being met through the influx o f foreign workers. T h i s i s particularly true at&#13;
jobs requiring higher order skills, such as, financial management, accounting, procurement, HR,&#13;
contractor and supervisory skills in engineering related trades, etc. Assuming that reconstruction efforts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        4&#13;
&amp;#12;continue, it i s likely that the demand for skilled labor in these areas will increase and the pressure on the&#13;
government will mount to ensure that there are a sufficient number o f Afghans in position to take these&#13;
opportunities as they emerge. This i s particularly true for formal sector employment in urban areas o f the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
19.      In rural areas, three decades o f conflict have constrained productivity and efficiency in farm and&#13;
non-farm production, limit opportunities for diversification o f production activities, make it more difficult&#13;
to take advantages o f mechanization, post-harvest technologies, and access quality inputs, processing,&#13;
transportation and marketing o f produce. T h i s i s compounded by the l o w levels o f education and training,&#13;
and lack o f skills, knowledge and understanding o f more productive and effective farming methods.&#13;
Provision o f training in this context i s more difficult as even the demand side i s weak and not very clearly&#13;
defined.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Against this background, the G O A i s aiming to promote investments and generate employment6,&#13;
develop a National Employment Strategy, and expand access to quality education and training at all&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
21.    The proposed project falls within this overall approach, which i s also the rationale b e h n d the&#13;
government's request for support to TVET. To summarize, the four principal issues that will need to be&#13;
addressed if TVET i s to be transformed into a demand-driven system are:&#13;
&#13;
                f&#13;
         Lack o a TVETframework that could promote, oversee and maintain a demand-driven provision&#13;
          f&#13;
         o training. Such a framework would require several elements: the capacity to cross ministerial&#13;
         borders; create partnerships with industry and the private sector; and the legal and institutional&#13;
         authority to play the above roles. This project intends to build on existing TVET elements, but&#13;
         re-orient and reposition these elements and bring in structural coherence through programs that&#13;
         are directly derived from a demand driven model. This i s perhaps the most cost-effective&#13;
         approach available to the GOA at present.&#13;
&#13;
            Weak incentives are in place, making it difficult to orient training programs towards a demand&#13;
           driven approach. This program provides for such incentives whereby training provision i s&#13;
           contracted out to only those providers who are capable o f ensuring close linkages both to the&#13;
           labor market and to the needs o f trainees.&#13;
&#13;
         Key elements associated with high quality and relevant training provision are not present or&#13;
         brought together in a coordinated manner to achieve the highest valuefor resources. The&#13;
         institutional changes envisaged in the proposed project will address the issues o f coordination,&#13;
         standard setting,certification, and regulation. The proposed project aims to provide a range o f&#13;
         s k i l l s training to meet the critical needs in the labor market as assessed by policymakers, training&#13;
         experts and professionals, and employers.&#13;
&#13;
                            f&#13;
        The stakeholders o the TVET system (including government and non-government training&#13;
        providers, employers, potential entrants to the labor market, etc.) are operating in the absence o f&#13;
        useful and timely information to make the right choices at the right time. There are two levels at&#13;
        which information will be gathered and utilized through this program. Firstly, information will&#13;
        be collected on labor market demand and supply through activities undertaken by the&#13;
        NSDP/MOLSAMD. Secondly, the project will monitor enrollment, attendance, drop-outs and&#13;
        pass-rates in all institutions supported through this effort. In addition, tracer studies will be&#13;
                                   ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  For example, through the establishment of the industrial parks and estates under the authority o f the Afghan&#13;
Investment Support Agency (AISA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          5&#13;
&amp;#12;        conducted t o determine labor market outcomes o f graduates and comparable control groups to&#13;
        determine program impacts. Furthermore, under Component 2 and 3, placement cells e x i s t h i l l&#13;
        be established at the institute levels, and this too will provide a wealth o f information.&#13;
&#13;
Government Stratem&#13;
&#13;
22.           The GOA i s in the process o f putting in place longer term policies and strategies for education&#13;
and s h l l s development as a whole, and specifically in the area o f TVET. It i s cognizant o f the need for a&#13;
full range o f skills in the country - from developing training programs t o improve productivity at the&#13;
small farm or cottage industry levels, to developing programs aimed at mid- to senior-management level&#13;
and for large industry levels. The GOA understands that a full range o f providers will be needed to cater&#13;
to s k i l l s needs in the country, and that the service providers need to be themselves distributed across the&#13;
skills-provision matrix in terms o f a well developed scheme.&#13;
&#13;
23.      With this understanding, the GOA launched the National Skills Development Program (NSDP) in&#13;
2004 as one o f four National Priority Programs (NPPs) designed to provide targeted social protection for&#13;
vulnerable groups throughout the country and to provide training to build the capacity o f the labor force.&#13;
 n&#13;
I the last two years, the NSDP has grown rapidly and today provides training to a wide range o f&#13;
participants, with nearly 15,000 trainees currently under training in programs facilitated by, and&#13;
formatively monitored and assessed by the NSDP.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Though the NSDP strategy envisages a much broader role for itself, with the NSDP eventually&#13;
emerging as an independent authority for TVET in the country, this vision has not been fully realized.&#13;
There are two factors that have contributed to this: (i)&#13;
                                                       fiagmentation o f provision across numerous&#13;
ministries and other providers, and (ii) NSDP being closely linked with a specific provider ministry,&#13;
                                       the&#13;
M O L S A M D . The Steering Committee established to help coordinate programs over nearly 11 Ministries,&#13;
has had only limited success in helping to develop such a coordinating and institutional role for the&#13;
NSDP. This has made it difficult for the NSDP to emerge as an independent authority t o oversee TVET&#13;
provision.&#13;
&#13;
25.       The London Conference (January 2006) concluded on the Afghan Compact, a significant feature&#13;
o f which are 27 identified benchmarks to be achieved by 20 10. The benchmarks are drawn from the&#13;
government's Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (IANDS), with the a i m to "provide&#13;
tangible benefits to the population." The benchmarks specifically related to vocational education and&#13;
training simply states that "150,000 persons are to be trained by the end o f 2010". The benchmark does&#13;
not specify the nature, thematic area, public versus private sector provisioning, pre- or in-service training,&#13;
level o f training, or any other aspect o f the training to be provided. Thus, different ministries have seen in&#13;
this benchmark a role for them to fulfill, though in a manner not well coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
26.      The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDs) will be finalized by March 2008. This&#13;
process has compelled the key education and s k i l l s development related ministries (viz., MOE, MOHE&#13;
and M O L S A M D ) t o work together in an effort to develop a meaningful and implementable sector&#13;
strategy. The W o r l d Bank and other donors have contributed to this process, and through dialogue with&#13;
the government, have suggested means by which the sector strategy can be made more effective. It has&#13;
been suggested that a comprehensive TVET strategy should be developed as part o f the proposed project&#13;
and further contribute to the goals the GOA has set for itself through the ANDs process. This i s currently&#13;
under discussion with various entities within the GOA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       6&#13;
&amp;#12;27.       Essentially, the Government realizes that:&#13;
&#13;
          persistent l o w level o f s k i l l s in the labor force will not only retard the pace o f development and&#13;
          reconstruction but will also open the door for foreign labor to enter the market and create a&#13;
          vicious cycle whereby local labor and local skills will always be overlooked&#13;
          dealing with this problem will necessitate building s k i l l s across a whole spectrum o f trades and&#13;
          professional skills in such a way that employers may choose a specific set o f s k i l l attributes (from&#13;
          elementary to expert levels) within a particular trade or profession and be assured o f a supply&#13;
          pool nevertheless&#13;
          this can be done when (1) there i s a framework which standardizes s k i l l s and provides a reliable&#13;
          certification and licensing (where needed) institutional arrangement, and (2) there i s a&#13;
          concomitant regulatory mechanism in place, and&#13;
          when the structure and interlinking o f service providers itself i s aligned t o the overall institutional&#13;
          arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
28.    Recognizing the importance o f this sector, the Government has acknowledged the need t o&#13;
underpin their TVET strategy by best international practice as i s related to effective TVET provision.&#13;
The proposed project takes as i t s premises the above set o f parameters and aims to:&#13;
&#13;
          strengthen and make relevant the present regulatory institutional structure and to, where&#13;
          necessary, develop new institutional structures with such legislative support as may be needed in&#13;
          order to bring in a standardized framework o f qualifications covering the complete range o f skills&#13;
          with specific requirements o f certification and licensing,&#13;
          strengthen existing service providers and bring in new service providers as necessary for the&#13;
          relatively advanced level o f skills while&#13;
          simultaneously providing for and strengthening existing mechanisms and service-provision&#13;
          structures for lower level skills that are intrinsic t o village and local level farming and industries.&#13;
&#13;
29.     I t i s proposed to address (a) to (c) above in terms also o f an overriding set o f K e y Guiding&#13;
Principles which the Bank team, together with intense consultations with the GOA, has identified to&#13;
govern project preparation, design and implementation. These are:&#13;
&#13;
          Demand Driven System: Develop a demand-driven TVET system to replace the current supply&#13;
          driven approach in selected trades and institutions&#13;
      0   Competency Based Modular Approach: Adopt competency based modular approach to deliver&#13;
          training programs instead o f the current time based system&#13;
          Institutional Autonomv: Give training institutions autonomy t o plan and customize their&#13;
          programs based o n sectoral and clients' needs&#13;
          Contracting-Out Training: Establish partnerships for effective delivery o f training with&#13;
          experienced national and international training providers t o improve service delivery and quickly&#13;
          produce graduates with qualifications that are globally competitive&#13;
          Industry and Private Sector Leadership: Industry leads in terms o f vision, sectors, curriculum,&#13;
          and certification to ensure a demand-driven training system&#13;
&#13;
The Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
30.     While the W o r l d Bank has been extensively involved in the education in Afghanistan since 2002&#13;
(with three IDA projects - Emergency Education and Rehabilitation, Education Quality Improvement&#13;
Project and the Strengthening Higher Education Project), i t s involvement in the TVET sector has been&#13;
more limited, with a JSDF financed Youth Entrepreneurship Empowerment and Development Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          7&#13;
&amp;#12;with the M O L S A M D . This has helped build four centers around the country and has trained about 4500&#13;
youth in select trades. The proposed project o f the W o r l d Bank will be the first major effort focused o n&#13;
TVET.&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     The Bank's involvement in both research and financing i s based o n direct requests from senior&#13;
policymakers in the MOF, MOE, MOHE, and M O L S A M D . The counterpart ministries are aware o f the&#13;
issues, the scale o f the problem, and the scope o f the proposed response o f the Bank through this project.&#13;
As such, these ministries have committed themselves to introduce and implement difficult reform&#13;
measures in an effort to transform the landscape for TVET in the country.&#13;
&#13;
32.        The rationale for Bank support for the Skills Development Sector i s very compelling. First, the&#13;
W o r l d Bank's Interim Strategy Note (ISN) recognizes skills shortages in the country and the impact this&#13;
has had on the recovery process in many sectors.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Secondly, the I S N identifies three strategic pillars under which the Bank proposes to work in the&#13;
years 200712008:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)   Building the capacity o f the state and its accountability to its citizens to ensure the provision&#13;
          o f services that are affordable, accessible and o f adequate quality,&#13;
    (ii) Promoting growth o f the rural economy and improving rural livelihoods, and&#13;
    (iii) Supporting growth o f a formal, modem and competitive private sector.&#13;
&#13;
34.       This proposed project has been designed to fit under all three pillars. It addresses the concerns o f&#13;
the first pillar by establishing an institutional, legislative and regulatory framework for TVET, which&#13;
enhances accountability to the citizens and provides services that are affordable, accessible and o f quality.&#13;
The second pillar i s addressed by providing support for training with a predominantly rural focus and thus&#13;
helping to promote growth in the rural economy. The final pillar i s supported since the proposed project&#13;
will prepare graduates for absorption in the modernizing industrial sector, thus supporting growth o f a&#13;
formal and modem private sector.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Thirdly, the Bank and other donors are already supporting the achievement o f high quality&#13;
elementary education and this has began to place increasing pressure o n increasing access t o quality post&#13;
secondary education and s k i l l s which are likely t o have a significant impact o n economic development.&#13;
Finally, while there are other Development Partners who can contribute financially to support the&#13;
Government o f Afghanistan in this area, the Bank i s acknowledged for i t s ability t o bring in comparable&#13;
global experiences, a constructive critique, and technical assistance for defined areas o f focus.&#13;
&#13;
36.     The Government's specific stakes and interest i s expressed in this project through (i)s           it&#13;
willingness to commit the resources o f more than one Ministry to the project, (ii) involvement o f&#13;
                                                                                               the&#13;
                                                                                                           i ia&#13;
some o f i t s highest h c t i o n a r i e s in oversight and other functions related to the project, and ( i ) stated&#13;
commitment to bring in the necessary legislative changes to strengthen the institutions. Government i s&#13;
also committed to providing the funds for the sustenance o f the institutions covered by this project on an&#13;
enduring basis.&#13;
&#13;
Development o f TVET System&#13;
&#13;
37.     The development o f a TVET program in Afghanistan will require a careful balance between&#13;
meeting the short-term training priorities o f the country to hasten the recovery process through targeted&#13;
TVET provision in focus sectors, with the development o f a medium- to longer-term vision for TVET&#13;
provision. The proposed project aims to achieve this balance by simultaneously focusing o n both meeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           8&#13;
&amp;#12;immediate training needs, while simultaneously developing a modern system o f TVET provision,&#13;
management, and regulation.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Given the years o f conflict, it i s necessary to develop priorities in all VET sub-sectors&#13;
simultaneously, as Afghanistan tends to span several centuries simultaneously in terms o f i t s training&#13;
needs. Since limitedresources prevent the GOA from exerting efforts in all directions, the proposed&#13;
project identifies priority areas and guidelines for investment. By prioritizing and articulating the&#13;
governments' goals and programs, achievable goals can be set and put into place in a manner that&#13;
provides the greatest returns on investment. Coordination o f donor efforts i s important to achieving such a&#13;
transformation since donor efforts sometimes are equally fragmented. Thus, making it difficult to&#13;
contribute towards the overall strategic development o f the sector.&#13;
&#13;
39.      The development o f a high-quality, equitable, cost-effective, responsive and sustainable TVET&#13;
system in Afghanistan i s not expected to be achieved in the life-time o f this proposed project. T h i s i s&#13;
long-term vision, which however requires the GOA to put into place the basic building blocks o f an&#13;
efficient system which could take as long as 12-15 years to achieve, as originally estimated by framers o f&#13;
the NSDP. Efforts to understand long t e r m needs o f the country will be a function o f demographic&#13;
changes, economic change and growth, and the rapidity with which newer technologies and business&#13;
practices are absorbed in the country over this period.&#13;
&#13;
40.     This project helps lay the foundations for a demand dnven training system to evolve over time.&#13;
This, the first stage, would focus on meeting short-term training needs while putting into place the basic&#13;
design for a TVET regulatory and institutional framework that would allow for the development o f a&#13;
demand driven TVET system. In this first phase, the project will on the one hand: (i)  provide rural-&#13;
markets oriented training for youth, destitute women, and marginal farmers aimed at diversifying income&#13;
sources, improving productivity, and developing market-linkages in rural Afghanistan without any pre-&#13;
condition o f prescribed schooling levels, and on the other hand: ( iprovide training in focused areas o f&#13;
                                                                   i)&#13;
the economy at the post-secondary level to prepare a cadre o f potential employees for entry- and mid-&#13;
management (such as, accounting technicians, procurement officers, supervisors and site engineers, etc.),&#13;
                       i ia&#13;
and embed both in ( i )vocational education and training system that i s demand driven, responsive to&#13;
the needs o f the economy and improves the employability o f all beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
41.      There will be a need to ensure that a Stage I1will help further develop the regulatory framework&#13;
even more, evolve incentives programs to enhance private participation, and strengthen the systems for&#13;
standards, certification and monitoring and evaluation. Development o f regulatory frameworks for&#13;
development o f curriculum, quality assurance mechanisms, standards for various trades and methods o f&#13;
assessing whether standards are being met will continue in this stage and be expanded to more economic&#13;
sectors and trades. Stage I1i s likely to witness a significant scaling up o f activities based on the results o f&#13;
the rigorously evaluated pilot interventions o f Stage I  .&#13;
&#13;
42.       Stage I11will place greater emphasis on assessing the sustainability o f various interventions&#13;
introduced in earlier stages. This will allow the government to make course corrections, drop failed&#13;
interventions, and scale-up and replicate successful efforts. Afghanistan i s emerging from three decades&#13;
o f conflict and thus there i s a need to balance the need for immediate training and the need to develop&#13;
appropriate systems for future benefits. Failure to develop systems in an effort to provide immediate&#13;
training could result in costly investment in programs that fail to be sustainable and have little or no value&#13;
a few years from now. Failure to provide immediate training could result in larger cohorts o f youth and&#13;
others with n o options either in the labor market or for further studies, and this can have other undesired&#13;
consequences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        9&#13;
&amp;#12;43.      The following section provides a brief description o f the activities to be undertaken in this first&#13;
stage o f rebuilding o f the TVET system. The key guiding principles identified in an earlier section&#13;
underpin the key components and put in place the needed reform measures.&#13;
&#13;
Proposed Project Development Objective&#13;
&#13;
45.      The project development objective (PDO) i s to increase the number o f immediately-employable&#13;
graduates by building, in stages, a high quality TVET system that i s equitable, market responsive, and&#13;
cost-effective. T h i s above project development objective i s to be operationalized through the project&#13;
components described below.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description&#13;
&#13;
Lending Instrument&#13;
&#13;
46.      The proposed project will be financed by an IDA Grant in the amount o f U S $20 million&#13;
equivalent. The lending instrument for this proposed project i s the Emergency Recovery Loan (OP 8.50),&#13;
which has been used for all projects in Afghanistan for which the request fkom Government was received&#13;
prior to March 1,2007. Although IDA'Snew Operational Policy o n Rapid Response (OP 8.00) i s in&#13;
effect, the previous OP 8.50 i s applied to ensure continuity in project processing. The proposed project&#13;
has received the necessary exceptions from OPCFC for the use o f OP 8.50 though the project duration (5&#13;
years) exceeds what i s stated under OP 8.50 guidelines. The project will involve the three key public&#13;
sector ministries engaged in education and training, viz., Education (MOE), Higher Education (MOHE),&#13;
and the Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD), with a specific focus on MOE and&#13;
M O L S A M D . In addition, the Government o f Norway and USAID will finance Sub-Component 2.1 in&#13;
the amount o f U S $ 6 million each.&#13;
&#13;
Proi ect Components&#13;
&#13;
47.     The project components are:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Develop Regulatory and Quality Assurance Framework for TVET (Total $1.5&#13;
             million, I D A $1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
48.      This component will create the necessary institutional conditions for a quality TVET system that&#13;
i s demand driven and oriented towards labor market needs. This will be achieved through the&#13;
establishment of: (a) an appropriate regulatory structure and quality assurance system; and (b) a&#13;
Qualifications Framework. This component will have three sub-components and will be developed in&#13;
parallel to Components 2 and 3 (see below). There i s sufficient information for the priority sectors&#13;
(Administration and Management, Accounting, Information and Communications Technology (ICT),&#13;
Basic Engineering Trades, and Agriculture) for the project to be able to move on Components 2 and 3,&#13;
while it puts in place new institutions to help manage and run a modern TVET system.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 1.1: Establish the Afghan National Qualification Authoritv (Total $0.3 million, IDA&#13;
                   $0.3 million)&#13;
&#13;
49.      This sub-component will establish an independent policy body known as the Committee o n&#13;
Education and Skills Policy (CESP), to be chaired by the Vice President. The CESP will be tasked with&#13;
putting in place the necessary legal and regulatory foundations to establish the Afghan National&#13;
Qualifications Authority (ANQA) as an independent, statutory Authority, with i t s own staffing and&#13;
budget line. Similarly, the legislation will also allow for the development o f the Qualification Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       10&#13;
&amp;#12;and several awarding boards. The CESP will be the apex policy body for education and training in the&#13;
country and will frame and execute necessary policies and provide required prescription until the&#13;
establishment o f the ANQA. The NSDP o f the M O L S A M D will initially act as the Secretariat for this&#13;
committee through an agreement reached between MOE, MOHE, MOF, and M O L S A M D . The&#13;
Secretariat o f the CESP (initially NSDP PIU) will cany out all administrative and management functions&#13;
o f the CESP. The CESP will thus also serve as a meeting point for the various interests in this project,&#13;
and it i s envisaged that many o f the issues o f coordination will be resolved through the meetings o f this&#13;
body.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 1.2: Establish the Afghan National Qualifications Framework (Total $0.8 million. IDA&#13;
                   $0.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
50.     This sub-component will be implemented by the A N Q A which will oversee the design,&#13;
development, and institutionalization o f a National Qualifications Framework (NQF). The N Q F will&#13;
provide a levels-based structure needed to map all education and training course provision in the country&#13;
and to allow for appropriate, coherent and meaningful certification and accreditation processes.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 1.3: Establish Awarding; Boards (Total $0.4 million. IDA $0.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
5 1.     The A N Q A will establish several Awarding Boards that will regulate and quality assure programs&#13;
within specific levels o f the NQF. In particular, for TVET, the A N Q A will establish a National&#13;
Vocational Education and Training Board (NVETB) as an independent, statutory Board, with a formal&#13;
charter, staffing and budget line. In addition to the NVETB, the Government has expressed an interest in&#13;
establishing a Board for Secondary Education, an Islamic Education Board, and a Higher Education&#13;
Board'. The establishment o f the Awarding Boards as stated earlier i s not a new effort. There have been&#13;
plans for the establishment o f such independent Boards on several different fronts (e.g., MOE wanting to&#13;
establish a Board for Secondary Education, NSDP/MOLSAMD wishing to establish an independent&#13;
authority for TVET) and the proposed project provides an opportunity to do so in a manner that i s&#13;
coordinated, comprehensive and inclusive.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Improve Relevance, Quality and Efficiency of TVET (Total $18.5 million, IDA $12.5&#13;
             million and Norway $6.0 million')&#13;
&#13;
52.       The objective o f this component i s to improve the relevance, quality and efficiency o f TVET&#13;
programs, and to increase the number o f graduates from these programs, through the establishment o f a&#13;
new institute, and by undertaking rehabilitation and reforms o f a select number o f other institutions.&#13;
Initially, training programs will be contracted out to experienced, national and international training&#13;
institutions through partnership arrangements. The partners will develop and implement comprehensive&#13;
training packages, using competency-based approaches in selected sectors, and simultaneously develop&#13;
indigenous capacity so that over a medium-term, the institutions involved may become academically self-&#13;
sufficient. These training packages will be designed in such a way as to allow them to be fitted onto the&#13;
N Q F once it i s established. There i s sufficient information regarding the priority sectors to allow for the&#13;
Component 2 to be implemented simultaneously with Component 1. Programmed activities will focus on&#13;
both direct teaching o f students and on the critical area o f training o f TVET teachers. T h i s component i s&#13;
envisaged as a broad-based one which will allow multi-trade, multi-center as well as specialized&#13;
vocational training and education centers to be established under i t s various sub-components.&#13;
&#13;
' The Higher Education Board over time could be further expanded to include a General Board for Higher&#13;
Education, a Board for Technical Education, etc.&#13;
8&#13;
  Expected contributions from Borrower (US $ 3 million) and U S A I D (US $ 6 million) not reflected here as these&#13;
are frnanced directly. Only co-financing from Government o f Norway i s administered through the ARTF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         11&#13;
&amp;#12;Sub-component 2.1 : Establish the National Institute o f Management and Administration INIMA) (Total&#13;
                    $11.O million, IDA $5.0 m i l l i o n and Government o f Norwav $6.0 milliong)&#13;
&#13;
53.      This sub-component i s aimed at establishing a new National Institute o f Management and&#13;
Administration which will offer programs in three key areas: (i)    Management and Administration, ( i        i)&#13;
                    i iInformation Technology. The Institute will cater to student at Grades 13 and 14.&#13;
Accounting, and ( i )&#13;
Management and activities within the Institute will be contracted out t o international training providers. A&#13;
new, fully equipped, campus will be developed. This sub-component will be executed in a partnership&#13;
with USAID (parallel financing) and the Government o f Norway (co-financed with IDA through the&#13;
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, ARTF). A Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) signed&#13;
between the MOE, U S A I D and the Government o f Norway, identifies the specific roles o f the various&#13;
parties, with Norway committing to financing the establishment o f new, physical infrastructure and goods&#13;
needed for the school and to finance the rehabilitation o f existing facilities to serve as temporary&#13;
accommodation, with U S A I D committing to supporting the `software' needs o f the new Institute, such as,&#13;
technical assistance and some o f the operating costs for the first three years. I t i s anticipated that the&#13;
contribution from USAID, particularly in terms o f direct technical assistance will decrease over time and&#13;
the Institute will be run more and more by Afghans. The MOE/GOA has also committed to take o n an&#13;
increasing share o f the operating budget and cover all local costs by the end o f Year 3. IDA proposes to&#13;
also finance the establishment o f the new institute and the rehabilitation o f temporary facilities. In&#13;
addition, IDA will finance scholarship support to the students and goods and equipment, such as,&#13;
computers, dormitory and classroom furniture, books, and a few vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.2: Institution-Based Reform Package (Total $7.0 million IDA $7.0 million")&#13;
&#13;
54.      This sub-component aims to support reforms and rehabilitation in the remaining institutions&#13;
within the DTVET mandate. These include the 42 institutions currently operating in Afghanistan and&#13;
which have not received support from other donors. Institutes under the DTVET, seeking financial and&#13;
technical assistance, will self-select into the program by expressing a willingness t o undertake the reforms&#13;
needed to improve their relevance, quality and efficiency. Reform measures would include inter alia: (i)&#13;
administrative and management process reforms, specifically by expanding stakeholder participation in&#13;
institute management, (ii)  focusing o n priority training sectors (administration and management,&#13;
accounting, ICT, basic engineering and agriculture), and (iii)   committing to a decentralized TVET&#13;
management framework in which at the end o f five years the institute i s operationally and financially&#13;
autonomous.&#13;
&#13;
55.       The MOE will develop a detailed guidance document o n what the reforms and rehabilitation&#13;
package will include and state the initial conditions and undertakings that have t o be met by institutions&#13;
intending to participate in the program. The MOE will then review the responses o f the individual&#13;
institutions and decide upon institution specific strategies and action programs within the institute. The&#13;
project will finance such support, including process consulting and technical assistance, physical&#13;
upgradation, appropriate purchase o f new equipment, and faculty training and support as may be&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.3: Management Reforms in DTVET (Total $0.5 million, IDA $0.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
56.     This sub-component aims t o support reforms within the DTVET which will ensure that: (i) the&#13;
various departments and personnel within DTVET develop a better understanding o f the structure and&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
    All o f USAID's expected contribution o f U S $ 6 million w i l l be focused on Sub-component 2.1.&#13;
loBorrower's    expected contribution o f U S $ 3 million i s likely to be spent on Sub-component 2.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            12&#13;
&amp;#12;functioning o f modem TVET systems and become more responsive to market needs and accountable for&#13;
effective vocational training delivery for institutions under their control, (ii)    concerned staff and officer&#13;
understand and implement the imperatives o f the whole project and address internal capacity building&#13;
issues as necessary, (iii) administrative procedures within DTVET are re-oriented in terms o f the&#13;
                          the&#13;
wider responsibilities that the implementation o f the project will entail. In as much as the DTVET i s a&#13;
major driver o f the whole project, it i s the responsibility o f this directorate to ensure that there i s a&#13;
seamless integration between internal DTVET reforms and external structural changes brought about&#13;
through the creation o f the ANQA, the Qualifications Framework and the NVETB. Therefore, internal&#13;
reforms shall be designed and implemented in such a manner that the overall project objectives are always&#13;
fully supported. Simultaneously with these visualized changes, capacity will also be built within the&#13;
DTVET to frame administrative and other policies based on the information that i s received from the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation u n i t s and agencies. Lastly, this sub-component will also focus on the&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) needs o f the DTVET and the IT infrastructure needed to support&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Skills Development Program and Market Linkages with a Rural Focus (Total $5.0&#13;
             million, I D A $5.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
57.     This component aims to support a slice o f the on-going activities by the National Skills&#13;
Development Program, and build the capacity within NSDP and MOLSAMD to undertake reforms in&#13;
technical and vocational training, labor market assessments, and to strengthen industrial and market&#13;
linkages. The three program subcomponents are:&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 3.1 : Contracted Vocational Training Packages (Total $ 3.0 million. IDA $3.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
58.      This component will contract out to training providers market driven training for waged and self&#13;
employment, with a focus on (i)   youth, (ii)`Chronically Poor Women' , and ( i )&#13;
                                                                               i imarginal farmers and&#13;
landless farm laborers. Training providers will be chosen competitively and their performance&#13;
formatively monitored. Training will be based on localized labor market studies and will typically cover&#13;
trades in the agnculture (including horticulture, animal husbandry, apiculture and market gardens),&#13;
construction sector and fabrication, etc. Where training relates to self-employment, Business&#13;
Development Services (BDS) training and facilitative links to micro-finance will be provided.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 3.2: Training; o f Trainers Program (Total $1.5 million, IDA $1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
59.      Contracted training for Productive Skills Officers (PSOs), BDS trainers, and selected trade&#13;
trainers; and the development o f a menu o f 15-20 contextualized productive skills curriculum materials,&#13;
through competitively selected public and private/NGO training providers, or consortia o f providers, to&#13;
support the USAID-fundedLearning and Community Empowerment Project 2 (LCEP2)&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 3.3 : CaDacitv Buildinp for N S D P M O L S A M D (Total $0.5 million, IDA $0.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
60.      This sub-component will build the capacity within NSDPhiOLSAMD in the following areas: (i)&#13;
curriculum and materials development, (ii)   capacity building in these organizations to collect, collate,&#13;
analyze and interpret labor market information. T h i s will also focus capacity building efforts on carrying&#13;
                                                                                  i itraining up to 10 key&#13;
out a labor force survey jointly with the Central Statistics Officer (CSO) and ( i )&#13;
personnel from the N S D P M O L S A M D in TVET planning, management and outreach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;Component 4: Research, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (Total $1.0 million, I D A $1.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
61.     The objective o f this component i s to develop a program monitoring and information system that&#13;
will provide routine, timely, and accurate information o n program implementation and allow for the&#13;
measurement o f longer term impacts and independent research.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 4.1: Monitoring and Decision Support (Total $0.4 million, IDA $0.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
62.     This sub-component will put in place monitoring and information systems to measure program&#13;
progress. Information generated by the monitoring system (and other relevant data) will be used as input&#13;
for a decision support mechanism which will identify alternatives and recommend course-corrections in&#13;
program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 4.2: Impact Evaluation (Total $0.6 million, IDA $0.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
63.      This sub-component will conduct impact evaluations o n specific sub-components in relationship&#13;
to stated program objectives and identified key performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
64.      This i s a challenging project for the following reasons: (a) complicated design involving several&#13;
ministries and numerous institutions, (b) weak implementation capacity, and in general, weak capacities&#13;
in both public and private sectors, and (c) the near in-conflict environment in which the project i s being&#13;
designed and which makes supervision more complicated and difficult. However, a key mitigation&#13;
strategy employed by the team has been to design the components in manner that ensures that&#13;
Components 2 and 3 are ring-fenced against the other. This ring-fenced structure allows for Components&#13;
2 and 3 to be implemented simultaneously without the risk o f weak implementation in one, affecting the&#13;
other.&#13;
&#13;
65.       n&#13;
          I most other post-conflict countries, s k i l l s development or W E T type projects have been&#13;
relatively slow to come onto the pipeline. That such a project i s being considered within a few years o f a&#13;
return to some semblance o f normalcy in Afghanistan, reflects the learning that has taken place within&#13;
IDA o n what works and what does not in post-conflict settings. The two main problems in such settings&#13;
are: (i) scant resources for such training and (ii) limited employment prospects after the training. And, yet&#13;
i s in exactly these conditions when even though vocational training provides a chance for education and&#13;
training opportunities for youth and young adults who have missed regular schooling due t o conflict.&#13;
&#13;
66.      In general, the project has risks that are associated with l o w management capacities leading to&#13;
administrative and policy level decisions that may not be in step with: (a) established timelines, (b) stated&#13;
priorities, (c) agreed upon processes. This i s largely due to the complexity o f the project and the very&#13;
large number o f technical issues that need to be at least partially understood by the members o f the&#13;
policy-malung bodies. Thus a major part o f inception level activities should focus o n ensuring that risks&#13;
arising out o f delayed or ambiguous decisions or decisions that do not match assumptions and are&#13;
determined apriori, are minimized. Risk mitigating strategies provided in Table 2 have been developed&#13;
to address these specific issues.&#13;
&#13;
67.      The various risks identified have been allocated to the various actors o n the basis o f an evaluation&#13;
as to who i s best equipped to manage these risks. Table 2 shows the potential impact o f each o f the&#13;
identified risks. This i s combined with a risk-specific mitigation plan.&#13;
&#13;
68.     The overall project risk rating i s Substantial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Financial Management, Disbursement and Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
69.     A Public Financial Management (PFM) performance rating system has been recently developed&#13;
for Afghanistan by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership&#13;
program, which includes the W o r l d Bank, IMF, EC, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the&#13;
PFM performance indicators portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and large, being&#13;
used for their intended purposes as authorized by a budget that i s processed with transparency and has&#13;
contributed to aggregate fiscal discipline.&#13;
&#13;
70.      Financial management and audit functions for proposed project will be undertaken through the&#13;
agents contracted under the Public Administration Capacity Building project. This i s the primary&#13;
instrument for continuing to strengthen the fiduciary measures put in place for ensuring transparency and&#13;
accountability o f funds provided by the Bank and other donors. Under these contracts, two advisers-&#13;
Financial Management and Audit-are responsible for working with the government and line ministries&#13;
to carry out these core functions. The Financial Management Agent (FMA) i s responsible for helping the&#13;
MOF maintain the accounts for all public expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and for building&#13;
capacity within the government offices for these functions.&#13;
&#13;
7 1.     At the project level, the Ministry o f Education Grants Management Unit and the Finance&#13;
Department o f the National Skills Development Program will undertake full responsibility o f the financial&#13;
management functions. The GMU has gained enormous experience from previous and currently&#13;
implemented Bank and other donor funded projects. I t has in its staffing qualified and experienced&#13;
international and national consultants and there are plans to engage additional staff t o strengthen the&#13;
capacity. The N S D P Finance Department also has adequate financial management arrangements and i t s&#13;
capacity will be strengthened with the engagement o f additional staffing for this project.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the GMU and NSDP Finance&#13;
Department. Consolidated project reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved by the MOF,&#13;
supported by the FMA.&#13;
&#13;
73.     A Designated Account (DA), will be opened at D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB, Central Bank) in the&#13;
name o f the project o n terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The DA will be maintained by the MOF.&#13;
Withdrawal applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly. Financial management&#13;
arrangements for the project are stated in details in Appendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Method&#13;
&#13;
74.     Disbursements from the IDA grant will make use o f advances, reimbursement, direct payment,&#13;
and payments under Special Commitments including records or against summary reports (statements of&#13;
expenditures), as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Audit o f Project Funds&#13;
&#13;
75.       The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, i s responsible for auditing the accounts o f a l l&#13;
IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements will be submitted within six months&#13;
o f the close o f GOA'S fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The Bank-funded projects already or currently being implemented by the Ministry o f Education&#13;
and Ministry o f Labor, Social Affairs and Martyred and Disabled, have n o over due audit reports; key&#13;
issues raised in these projects previous audit reports are being resolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      17&#13;
&amp;#12;Procurement&#13;
&#13;
77.      With donor assistance, Afghanistan has made considerable efforts to establish the Legal and&#13;
Regulatory Framework for public procurement over the last five years. A new Procurement Law,&#13;
reflecting international best practice in public procurement was enacted in November 2005 replacing the&#13;
earlier procurement regulations. While it provides a very modem legal system for procurement, effective&#13;
implementation o f the l a w may encounter difficulties in the current weak institutional structure and&#13;
capacity o f the Government. A Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) has n o w been established under MOF to&#13;
ensure the implementation through the creation o f secondary legislation, standard bidding documents,&#13;
provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary information systems for advertising and data collection.&#13;
"Rules o f Procedure for Public Procurement" which details the better implementation o f the Procurement&#13;
L a w has been issued by MOF as circular number PPU/COO5/1386 dated April, 12 2007. The Procurement&#13;
Appeal and Review mechanism i s in place and the Manual o f Procedures for "Procurement Appeal and&#13;
Review" has been issued by MOF as circular number PPUM001/1385 o n March 18,2007.&#13;
&#13;
78.      The special Procurement Commission, comprising Ministry o f Justice and Ministry o f Economy,&#13;
under the chairmanship o f Minister o f Finance approves high value contracts. The current thresholds&#13;
                                                         Goods more than U $100,000; ( i )&#13;
levels for: (i) i v i l works more than U S $500,000, (ii)&#13;
              C                                                           S              i iConsultants&#13;
more than U S $200,000 and all contracts following Direct Contracting or Single Source Selection&#13;
Procedure independent o f value. These thresholds are n o w being reviewed with consideration for an&#13;
upward revision thus decentralizing the authority t o MOF.&#13;
&#13;
79.     n&#13;
        I the absence o f adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some interim&#13;
arrangements have been put in place t o improve the procurement management o f the country. A central&#13;
procurement facilitation service, Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services (ARDS-PU) has&#13;
been established under the supervision o f Ministry o f Economy.&#13;
&#13;
80.      The Bank and the Government have agreed o n a program for country wide procurement reform&#13;
and capacity building, leading to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services.&#13;
The Bank funded Public Administration Capacity Buildingproject (PACBP) i s the primary instrument for&#13;
implementing the program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement in&#13;
an effective, transparent and accountable manner. The envisaged radical changes t o the procurement&#13;
management environment expected from the new l a w also require the urgent implementation o f a&#13;
comprehensive human resources and capacity development program. The implementation o f the&#13;
procurement reform component o f the PACBP should be considered with due priority to ensure that&#13;
fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s developed in the Government to maintain&#13;
these standards. A three year contract for procurement capacity building i s in place under PACBP. T h i s&#13;
assignment should result in development o f critical mass o f procurement professionals through intensive&#13;
and extensive training. The consultant's TORSinclude the development o f an accreditation system for&#13;
procurement professionals. In addition, the law, procedures, procurement appeal, and review mechanisms&#13;
need wide dissemination to the c i v i l society to enhance transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
8 1.     The Ministry o f Education (MOE) and National Skill Development Program (NSDP) will have&#13;
overall responsibility for all procurement under the project. B o t h the implementing agencies will&#13;
implement procurement action as requested by the Afghanistan Skill Development Project. Procurement&#13;
will be in accordance with the W o r l d Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" (dated M a y 2004; revised October 2006); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (dated M a y 2004; revised October 2006); and the provisions&#13;
                                                    n&#13;
stipulated in the Development Grant Agreement. I addition, the W o r l d Bank's "Guidelines o n&#13;
Preventing and Combating Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants"&#13;
(dated October 15,2006), has been shared with the recipient. Bank's Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     18&#13;
&amp;#12;Requests for Proposals, and Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used. Civil works and goods following&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures shall be procured using the agreed Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents (SBDs) for Afghanistan. In case o f conflictkontradiction between the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures will take&#13;
precedence as per the Article 4(3) o f the Procurement L a w o f the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan&#13;
(IROA) dated October 2005. The summary o f the procurement capacity assessment o f the implementing&#13;
agencies and precise arrangements are presented in Annex 7.&#13;

&amp;#12;                             Annex 3: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The GOA has recognized the importance o f skills development in the process o f recovery and&#13;
rehabilitation o f a country that had been in c i v i l strife for a period o f nearly three decades. Early o n in&#13;
this recovery process the GOA identified slulls development as an essential ingredient and began to lay&#13;
the groundwork for a major thrust in this area.&#13;
&#13;
2.         K e y line ministries were identified and mobilized, a new National Priority Program - the&#13;
National Slulls Development and Market Linkages Program was established, and the government,&#13;
through the support o f key donors, began to build new infrastructure (e.g., the Afghan Korea Vocational&#13;
Training Institute and vocational training institutes supported by JICA, Government o f Iran, and the&#13;
W o r l d Bank), and rehabilitate some existing institutions in the country. Furthermore, an increasing&#13;
number o f NGOs were encouraged to offer vocational training programs around the country. The GOA i s&#13;
keen to increase the number o f people undergoing labor market relevant training and has set a target o f&#13;
150,000 people to be trained as stated in the Afghan Compact. T h i s does not take into account the fact&#13;
that thousands o f people continue to receive most o f their career related training through informal and&#13;
traditional apprenticeship programs, though this i s very difficult to quantify and document.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The strategies adopted by the GOA to implement their vision for s k i l l s development are&#13;
predicated o n a two pronged approach: (i)   increased access to technical vocational education and training&#13;
opportunities around the country, and (ii)  enhanced relevance o f the programs to the needs o f the labor&#13;
market. The GOA has also identified and recognized the need for a variety o f providers (public, private&#13;
and non-government), the need for modular competency-based and assessed programs (instead o f&#13;
programs that are defined purely by major, formal examinations and the length o f time spent in&#13;
classrooms), for a good mix o f theory and practical training, and for the need for a coherent system for a l l&#13;
education and training, but particularly underpinning the TVET sub-sector. The Bank's project design&#13;
will ensure that all these suggestions are taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
4.       In terms o f the target beneficiaries o f this project there are two main groups: (i)&#13;
                                                                                             young men and&#13;
women who have completed Grade 12 and are seeking to improve their s k i l l s through post-secondary&#13;
training programs diploma and certificate programs that will allow them t o enter the labor market directly&#13;
or continue their studies by enrolment in regular degree programs; and (ii)     second chance training&#13;
opportunities for those who have not had, or have had limited, formal schooling to enhance their s k i l l s to&#13;
increase their employability or make them more adapted for self-employment in the informal sector. T w o&#13;
special target sub-populations will include girls and women, and persons with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Since 2002, the number o f girls accessing general schooling has increased f r o m nearly 0% to 35%&#13;
in 2006/07. However, they are s t i l l significantly under-represented in higher level education and&#13;
specifically in vocational and technical education. The recent census o f institutions under DTVETMOE&#13;
shows that only 8% o f the students in Grades 13/14 in these training institutions are women. Part o f the&#13;
reason for this l o w number i s due to the nature o f the courses being taught largely oriented towards&#13;
engine, mechanic repairs, construction, etc., all o f which do not employ women in the labor market. A&#13;
number o f teachershainers in these sectors are however women. Training under the N S D P mandates that&#13;
implementing partners must ensure a minimum threshold for women and persons with disabilities o f 35%&#13;
and 10% respectively. This project will continue this emphasis on increasing access t o these special sub-&#13;
groups in the Afghan context. A detailed gender assessment i s included in Annex 11 o f this Technical&#13;
Annex and a Disability Assessment would be prepared within six months o f project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         28&#13;
&amp;#12;The Project by Components&#13;
&#13;
6.       The project development objective (PDO) i s to increase the number o f immediately-employable&#13;
graduates by building, in stages, a high quality TVET system that i s equitable, market responsive, and&#13;
cost-effective.&#13;
&#13;
7.      This will be operationalized through the specific components described below.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Develop Regulatory and Quality Assurance Framework for TVET (Total $1.5&#13;
             million, IDA $1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
8.      The GOA, recognizing the need for coherence across various levels o f learning in the country,&#13;
has committed itself to undertaking difficult reforms and in developing a new institutional framework for&#13;
education and training, and in particular for TVET. This component will create the necessary institutional&#13;
conditions for a TVET system in an effort to satisfy the requirements o f the above stated PDO. The two&#13;
main elements o f this component include the establishment o f an appropriate regulatory structure and&#13;
quality assurance system; and a Qualifications Framework. This component will be developed in parallel&#13;
with the implementation o f Components 2 and 3. This i s a difficult component, requiring the&#13;
establishment o f new institutional and regulatory structures to replace the existing structures that are&#13;
fragmented across three or more ministries. The focus on the priority sectors (Administration and&#13;
Management, Accounting, ICT, Basic Engineering Trades, and Agriculture) allows for the&#13;
implementation o f Components 2 and 3, even though Component 1 i s not fully developed.&#13;
&#13;
9.       This component builds o n existing designs and plans for independent institutions to help regulate&#13;
and ensure quality provision across the education and training sectors, though it i s unlikely that without&#13;
the added impetus provided by the proposed project, it i s unlikely that these institutions will get&#13;
established. For example, the original strategy documents o f the NSDP calls for the establishment o f an&#13;
independent authority for TVET. However, n o legislation has been drafted or moved in the past three&#13;
years. Similarly, the MOE has plans for the establishment o f an independent board for secondary&#13;
education, and the proposed project could assist the MOE put such an institution in place. However, as&#13;
stated earlier, the roles and responsibilities o f such institutions are not clear; their modes o f operation are&#13;
well established, and sometimes not even relevant to a dynamic and vibrant education and training&#13;
system. The key contribution o f the proposed project i s to bring together a disparate set o f actors, with a&#13;
similar set o f goals, to help develop an education and training framework that provides coherence across&#13;
various levels and i s comprehensive in i t s coverage. It i s necessary to strengthen these institutions, bring&#13;
them under a properly defined legislative umbrella, make explicit their functions, roles and&#13;
responsibilities, and to professionalize them so that they can become pro-active agents in the&#13;
institutionalization and sustenance o f the TVET system as envisaged in this document.&#13;
&#13;
10.     It i s clearly recognized and understood that the institutional system must be designed, and must&#13;
operate in such a manner that capacity i s built throughout the range o f trades and skills, but must do so in&#13;
a way that will ensure standardization, and therefore competitiveness o f Afghan labor vis-&amp;vis labor from&#13;
foreign countries.&#13;
&#13;
11.    The specific activities to be accomplished through these components are described in the three&#13;
sub-components highlighted below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       29&#13;
&amp;#12;Sub-component 1.1: Establish o f the Afghan National QualificationAuthority (Total $0.3 million,&#13;
                   IDA $0.3 million)&#13;
&#13;
12.     This sub-component will establish the ANQA through an act o f parliament. This will be the&#13;
highest regulatory and standards setting body in the country for education and training and would help&#13;
bring about coherence (when the QF i s developed) to the education and training sectors.&#13;
&#13;
13.      A Committee o n Education and Skills Policy (CESP) will be established under the Chairmanship&#13;
o f the Vice President. I t has been agreed between MOE, MOHE and M O L S A M D , that the NSDP o f the&#13;
M O L S A M D will take o n the responsibilities o f initially establishing a Secretariat for the CESP. The&#13;
CESP will comprise o f the Vice President, representatives o f MOE, MOHE and M O L S A M D , a&#13;
representative o f MOF, two members representing the private sector, and two members representing the&#13;
donor community (on a revolving basis). A Designated Officer o f the NSDP will be the Secretary to the&#13;
CESP, but without the rights o f a full Member. All ministerial representation will be at the level o f the&#13;
Minister, with their deputies being identified as the alternates o n the committee. The Secretariat o f the&#13;
CESP will be responsible for all administrative and management functions o f the CESP - including the&#13;
hiring o f technical experts needed to draft legal documents for the establishment o f new, statutory,&#13;
regulatory structures, and for the development o f the NQF). The CESP shall initiate the establishment o f&#13;
the Afghan National Qualifications Authority. U p o n the establishment o f ANQA, all policy and other&#13;
functions performed by CESP under Component 1 o f the Project, including the development and&#13;
institutionalization o f the National Qualifications Framework, will be transferred t o the ANQA.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The agreement to avail o f the facilities and personnel o f the NSDP PIU as a Secretariat for the&#13;
CESP initially i s reflected in a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) between the three concerned&#13;
ministries and the NSDP". The Secretariat o f the CESP will be responsible for overall coordination o f&#13;
Component 1. The Secretariat o f the CESP will ensure coordination across government, donors, and&#13;
user-agencies for a sustainable and smooth multi-year programmatic approach t o building the TVET&#13;
capacity in the country. The Director o f the NSDP will oversee the program, with the assistance o f&#13;
consultants and longer-term national staff all chosen competitively. The TORSfor all persons to be hired&#13;
and brought o n board will be shared with the CESP for comments and the selection will be done by a duly&#13;
appointed sub-committee o f the CESP&#13;
&#13;
15.        The CESP-Secretariat will work in close coordination with the concerned departments (such as&#13;
DTVET) and other relevant ministries and agencies involved in TVET. The main function o f the&#13;
Secretariat i s to facilitate the implementation o f Component 1. I t i s also responsible for (a) assuring&#13;
steady progress o f execution in accordance to an implementation schedule reviewed and approved by the&#13;
W o r l d Bank, (b) regular reporting to the CESP, and (c) ensuring that a high ethical standard and&#13;
transparency i s maintained throughout the process.&#13;
&#13;
16.     All new regulatory bodies established under Component 1, would be statutory bodies having been&#13;
approved by an A c t o f Parliament, and shall be independent o f all ministerial linkages. This includes the&#13;
Afghan National Qualifications Authority and the awarding boards, such as, the Board for Secondary&#13;
Education, the National Vocational Education and Training Board, the Islamic Education Board, and the&#13;
Higher Education Board. The statutory nature o f these decisions will ensure the corresponding&#13;
developments needed t o finance such an entity in the initial years, with the expectation that over time&#13;
(approximately ten years) these bodies will become self-sustaining&#13;
&#13;
17.     All new regulatory bodies will be headed by professionals who will have the title o f CEO. For&#13;
the interim period, they will receive some support from the project but in the long run these new bodies&#13;
&#13;
l1Ths   MOU has been signed by a l l the concerned Ministries and the MOF o n December 14,2007&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      30&#13;
&amp;#12;will receive financing from the Government, but through a direct budget line that does not pass through&#13;
the provider ministries, such as, MOE, M O L S A M D , and MOHE. Such an arrangement will ensure that&#13;
the quality control and quality assurance functions o f these institutions, i s not compromised by a financial&#13;
dependence on provider ministries. Such a separation between a regulatory authority and providers i s&#13;
needed to ensure checks and balances in the system to improving the quality, relevance, equity and access&#13;
to education and training programs.&#13;
&#13;
18.      The CESP may evolve into an oversight committee to oversee the functioning o f the ANQA and&#13;
related bodies depending upon the view that the Government takes after the establishment o f the ANQA.&#13;
At this point in time however, it i s anticipated that the CESP will cease to exist once the ANQA has been&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The CESP will put in place the necessary administrative, legal and regulatory foundations needed&#13;
to establish the ANQA in a time-bound manner. Outputs, approvals and concurrences o f the CESP will&#13;
therefore include: (a) the presentation and ratification o f an A c t in Parliament for the establishment o f the&#13;
ANQA, and to define i t s Charter, role and mandate under the Act, and (b) all other interventions required&#13;
to effectively implement the Act.&#13;
&#13;
20.     The specific functions o f the ANQA will be to: (i)  establish and maintain a National&#13;
Qualifications Framework (NQF) for the recognition, development and award o f qualifications based on&#13;
standards, skills, and competencies to be achieved by student and trainees; (ii) establish and promote the&#13;
maintenance o f awards standards at least in the area o f W E T and perhaps in other areas as w e l l&#13;
                                                          i ipromote and facilitate access, progression and&#13;
depending o n which other bodies are established; and ( i )&#13;
movement through the Framework.&#13;
&#13;
2 1.     The A c t will also establish or modify other institutions which together will constitute the sub-&#13;
ordinate qualifications, standards, quality assurance and awarding authorities for the education and&#13;
training sectors. In particular, the Act will simultaneously establish the National Vocational Education&#13;
and Training Board (NVETB)", which will be a major element in terms o f TVET reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 1.2:         Establish the Afghan National Qualifications Framework (Total $0.8&#13;
                           million, IDA $0.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
22.     This sub-component will be implemented by the ANQA which will oversee the design,&#13;
development, and institutionalization o f the NQF. The NQFwill provide a levels-based structure needed&#13;
to map all education and training competencies into specific award-types and helps to create a learner&#13;
centered environment.&#13;
&#13;
23.      This i s particularly important in the Afghan context given the disruption in education and training&#13;
due t o conflict years, The NQFwill help to:&#13;
&#13;
                  recognize prior learning (for example, o f the large number o f IDPs and returnees),&#13;
             0    bring about much needed standardization through the adoption o f levels based curricula&#13;
                  and awards,&#13;
             0    provide a clear signal to employers o n the abilities and s k i l l s available,&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
  T h e Act w i l l also provide space for the establishment o f the following: Secondary Education Board, Higher&#13;
Education Board, the Islamic Education Board. For general education, i t i s proposed that a Board o f Secondary and&#13;
Higher Secondary education be established independento f the Ministry o f Education to set standards and accredit&#13;
secondary and senior secondary programs offered through government schools, within the prescriptions o f the&#13;
ANQA. The Board could also conduct the School Leaving Certificate Examination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        31&#13;
&amp;#12;            0   allow trainees to concretize their learning needs and develop a commitment to l i f e long&#13;
                learning&#13;
                lay the groundwork for reciprocity and mutual recognition arrangements with other&#13;
                countries.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Establishing and maintaining an NQFwill require a number o f steps:&#13;
            0   engage in extensive consultations in the process o f developing the guidelines for&#13;
                establishing the NQF,&#13;
                decide on policies and criteria o n which the NQFi s t o be established&#13;
                prepare an outline o f the proposed framework.&#13;
            0   define the relevant levels in the framework and the generic learning outcomes&#13;
                (knowledge, skills and competences) associated with each level.&#13;
                prepare a backgroundconsultative paper on the proposed NQF development for the next&#13;
                series o f consultations t o obtain a consensus on this with other stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
25.     At each step o f the way it i s important to review the purpose o f the NQFin light o f the need to&#13;
move towards a more learner centered approach to education and training, instead o f the current system&#13;
where the learner i s merely a participant.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Once a framework has been mapped out and legally approved, the Authority would have t o work&#13;
with awarding bodies, such as, NVETB, to apply this new framework, develop standards for new&#13;
qualifications, and `map' existing qualifications o n t o the framework.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 1.3: Establish Awarding Board (Total $0.4 million, I D A $0.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
27.      As stated earlier, the A c t will also provide the necessary legal and regulatory underpinning&#13;
needed to establish several awarding bodies or councils. For TVET, the A c t will provide legislative cover&#13;
for the establishment o f a National Vocational Education and Training Board (NVETB) with a formal&#13;
charter. The Act will also provide space for the establishment o f a Board for Secondary Education, an&#13;
Islamic Education Board, and a Higher Education Board as stated earlier.&#13;
&#13;
28.      The establishment o f the NVETB has already been envisaged in earlier government documents&#13;
(please refer to Education Sector Strategy prepared by the ANDs and to the strategy document o f the&#13;
NSDP). I t i s anticipated that the policy functions currently being undertaken by the various departments&#13;
within the MOE, MOHE, M O L S A M D , and the NSDP PIU will be transferred to the NVETB once it has&#13;
been established. These Boards will be independent entities with their own staffing, budget and&#13;
functions, but will act under the direction o f the ANQA to realize their aims and objectives, as set out in&#13;
the Act. The NVETB will be a joint decision making body and will include in i t s membership all the key&#13;
national stakeholders involved in the TVET system in the country.&#13;
&#13;
29.     The Boards will be primarily responsible for facilitating and applying the policies o f the ANQA&#13;
and in ensuring that the procedures set by it are implemented by providers. The Boards will maintain the&#13;
quality and standards demanded by the ANQA. They will also have the right to determine credit for prior&#13;
learning and the awards to individuals who have not gone through any specific provider or without&#13;
participation in specific programs, in terms o f the NQF.&#13;
&#13;
30.      The proposed Secondary Education Board will help ensure that the `school leaving' standards set&#13;
by the ANQA are being complied with through the conduct o f a common school leaving certification&#13;
examination, and through other quality control and assurance mechanisms. The MOE has expressed a&#13;
desire to establish an Islamic Education and Training Board to provide a systematic relationship between&#13;
students in Islamic education programs and those in general or vocational schooling. This will allow for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     32&#13;
&amp;#12;developing coherence across similar levels o f competencies in both general and Islamic education, and&#13;
permit the movement o f students from one to the other. The adoption o f such a model would make it a&#13;
first o f i t s kind in the world.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Improve Relevance, Quality and Efficiency of TVET (Total $18.5 million, IDA $12.5&#13;
             million and Norway $6.0 million")&#13;
&#13;
3 1.    The objective o f this component i s to improve the relevance, quality and efficiency of TVET&#13;
programs, and to increase the number o f graduates from these programs, through the establishment o f a&#13;
new institute, and by undertaking reforms in a select number o f other institutions. Training programs will&#13;
be contracted to experienced, national and international training institutions through partnership&#13;
arrangements. The partners will develop and implement comprehensive training packages, using&#13;
competency-based approaches in selected sectors. Given that these training packages will be designed&#13;
with modem and up to date standards and curriculum, this will allow for them to be mapped into the N Q F&#13;
once this has been established at a later stage. It should be noted that Component 2 will not be held in&#13;
abeyance till Component 1 has been fully implemented, both will be implemented simultaneously.&#13;
Courses developed for Component 2 and 3 will be placed on the Framework (at the appropriate level)&#13;
once the N Q F has been developed. Programmed activities will focus o n both direct teaching o f students&#13;
and on the training o f TVET teachers.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.1: Establish the National Institute o f Managementand Administration (NIMA)&#13;
                  (Total $11.0 million, IDA $5.0 million and Government of Norway $6.0&#13;
                  rni~ion'~)&#13;
&#13;
32.     This sub-component i s aimed at establishing a new National Institute o f Management and&#13;
Administration, under a cabinet decision involving the Ministries o f Education, Higher Education, and&#13;
Economy. The Institute will provide training in the areas o f (i)  Management and Administration, (ii)&#13;
Accounting, and (iii) Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The Institute will cater to&#13;
students at Grades 13 and 14. Thus, minimum requirements for entry to this Institute would be a pass in&#13;
Grade 12 from either the general or vocational education streams. A new, fully equipped, campus will be&#13;
developed and i s likely to cater to about 2000 per year in all three fields.&#13;
&#13;
33.       Donor Sumort and Coordination: This sub-component will be executed in a partnership with&#13;
USAID (parallel financing) and the Government o f Norway (co-financed with IDA through the ARTF).&#13;
The Government o f Norway and USAID will provide U S $ 6 million each over a three year period. IDA&#13;
will provide an additional U S $ 5 million over a 5 year period. While USAID, through it principal&#13;
contracting partner, Bearing Point, will support the project through the development and implementation&#13;
o f all necessary software components including, provision o f international experts and trainers, text&#13;
books, computer software, etc., the Government o f Norway and IDA will finance hardware costs&#13;
associated with the establishment o f this institute. This will primarily focus on c i v i l works, goods and&#13;
equipment. Donor coordination has been enshrined in an MOU between USAID, the Government o f&#13;
Norway and the GOA, signed on October 10,2007, and to which IDA was a witness.&#13;
&#13;
34.      I t i s anticipated that the contribution from USAID, particularly in terms o f direct technical&#13;
assistance will decrease over time and the Institute will be increasingly run by Afghans. The MOE/GOA&#13;
has also committed to take on an increasing share o f the operating budget and cover all local costs. T o&#13;
this effect, GOA has committed to financing all local costs o f the Institute &amp;om the very start o f the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l3Expected contributions from Borrower (US $ 3 million) and U S A I D (US $ 6 million) not reflected here as these&#13;
are financed directly. Only co-financing from Government o f Norway i s administered through the ARTF.&#13;
l4All o f USAID's expected contribution o f U S $ 6 million will be focused o n Sub-component 2.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        33&#13;
&amp;#12;project at Year 1. This will help ensure the sustainability o f the investment both by reducing the operating&#13;
costs o f the institute to a more meaningful amount, and by providing an environment where well&#13;
qualified, professional Afghans run the Institute and eventually take o n training roles.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Oversight Provision: A Steering Committee (SC) will be established to provide oversight to the&#13;
functioning o f the Institute. The SC i s expected to have participation from the three concerned ministries,&#13;
members o f the private sector and academia, and with a revolving membership from the three principal&#13;
donor organizations. The SC will be Chaired by the Minister for Education, as the other ministries party&#13;
to the Cabinet decision have given the MOE the leadership role o n this Institute.&#13;
&#13;
36.      Institutional Autonomy: The SC and DTVET will have distinct supervision and oversight roles&#13;
over NIMA. While SC will be concerned with strategic direction and internal and external policy,&#13;
DTVET will primarily be concerned with ensuring that overall policies o f the national government are&#13;
being adhered to. The Institute will be established as an autonomous one with n o role o f the two&#13;
oversight bodies o n i t s day to day functioning. The autonomous nature o f the Institute will ensure the&#13;
management's complete and sole responsibility and accountability for i t s functioning, performance and&#13;
the outcomes achieved. All Institute level decisions including issues such as faculty hiring and&#13;
replacement, student selection procedures and systems, assessments, course content, identification and&#13;
procurement o f teaching learning materials, and numerous other decisions to be taken in the running o f an&#13;
institution o f this kind will be at the sole discretion o f the Institute's management. The SC and the MOE&#13;
together will approve the annual or multi-year work plans o f the Institute and monitor progress carefully&#13;
to ensure that the planned targets are being met.&#13;
&#13;
37.                                               n&#13;
       Contract-Out Management and ODeration: I the initial years o f the Institute's operation, the&#13;
program will be managed by contracting out to experienced, reputed, international training providers.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Training o f Trainers: An important part o f this program will be the training o f trainers (TOT).&#13;
Students in the program will be trained by Afghan trainers who have undergone intensive TOT programs&#13;
with the partner agency selected to manage this Institute. T w o forms o f TOT programs will be provided -&#13;
an Accelerated Training Program for Year 1, and a Basic Training Program thereafter. The TOT program&#13;
will also be open to participants o f other institutions in Afghanistan who desire to upgrade their faculty&#13;
capacities in the three fields specified under this program. The international faculty will provide all the&#13;
necessary supervision t o Afghan faculty and thus, help in the capacity building objectives.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Equity Issues: The GOA desires that students at the Institute shall be drawn from all parts o f the&#13;
country. The Institute will ensure equitable access through the provision o f on-site residential facilities. I t&#13;
has been decided that students from outside o f Kabul (likely to be about 70% o f the total) will be lodged&#13;
in dormitories constructed o n the Institute's premises. I t i s expected this approach would also help in&#13;
addressing concerns o f gender equity. Since parity may be difficult to achieve in a country like&#13;
Afghanistan, widespread dissemination campaigns will be needed to ensure regular and continued&#13;
participation o f female students. Alternatives to being housed at the Institute could be to provide an&#13;
equivalent stipend and allows such students to live with relatives in Kabul. Additionally, given the post-&#13;
conflict status o f the country and the large number o f persons with disabilities, due t o injuries and&#13;
otherwise, the program will focus o n making these available to a broader set o f individuals.&#13;
&#13;
40.     Course Structure: The agency contracted t o run this institute will be given the freedom t o devise&#13;
the details o f the curriculum. However, the structure o f courses will follow a modular, competency based&#13;
model. All programs offered by the Institute will conform to the developments in the overall structure&#13;
being institutionalized through Component 1. All the coursed programs offered by the Institute will have&#13;
to be mapped on to the NQFafter i t s establishment in Year 2. I t i s expected that the Institute will&#13;
primarily provide three types o f training programs - (i) 1 year Certificate Program, (ii)2 year Diploma&#13;
                                                           a                                  a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      34&#13;
&amp;#12;Program and (iii) host o f short-courses aimed at individuals who are unable to participate in longer term&#13;
                 a&#13;
programs due to work commitments. The proportion o f these courses will be determined by the&#13;
Institute's management as a response to the perceived demand for various program lengths.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Accreditation and Professional Certification: I t i s expected that any provider selected to manage&#13;
and run the Institute will itself be accredited and recognized by various international institutes. The&#13;
awarding o f certificates/diplomas will be done by the Awarding Bodies once established. While this will&#13;
greatly increase the mobility o f the Institute's graduates, students will also be encouraged to obtain&#13;
professional certification through industry or professional bodies, such as, various regional and&#13;
international chartered accounting institutes and other professional bodies (e.g., I C A S L or ACCA, etc.),&#13;
and in the area o f ICT through Microsoft or Cisco Certification programs or any other equivalent&#13;
programs. The Institute's management will be responsible for developing the necessary linkages needed&#13;
for professional certification with the help o f the donor partners. The percentage o f graduates o f these&#13;
programs who obtain professional certification will be one o f the key indicators o f the success o f this&#13;
Institute.&#13;
&#13;
42.       Imprest Account and Cost Recoveq: Along with the need for operational autonomy, it i s&#13;
expected that an Imprest Bank account will be opened to permit flexibility in the day t o day functioning&#13;
o f the Institute. All the courses offered at the Institute will be costed-out and a fee plan prepared and&#13;
students interested in attending the Institute without financial support from the MOE or Institute, will&#13;
become eligible for participation o n a fee paying basis. Financing from such sources or from the sale o f&#13;
shorter term programs will be retained within the Institute for future investments.&#13;
&#13;
43.      M e d i u m o f Instruction: The medium o f instruction will be English. However, care shall be taken&#13;
to see that this does not have a significant impact o n equity. T h i s will require the implementation o f&#13;
affirmative action programs and the introduction o f bridging courses in English and Computer Literacy,&#13;
as well as refresher programs in basic mathematics and other relevant subjects.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 2.2: Institution-Based Reform Package (Total $7.0 million I D A $7.0 milli~n'~)&#13;
&#13;
44.      This sub-component aims to support reforms and rehabilitation in a self-selected subset o f the&#13;
DTVET's remaining 42 institutions which have not received support from other donors16. These&#13;
institutions are plagued by the same issues discussed earlier in the document, including problems in&#13;
institutional and regulatory structures (fragmented decision making), governance, management and&#13;
administration at the Institute and DTVET level (for example, n o stakeholder involvement and centralized&#13;
decision making with little r o o m for decisions to be taken at the Institute level,), programs with very l i t t l e&#13;
relevance (supply driven programs with little links to the needs o f the labor market), poor quality o f&#13;
inputs and outcomes (resource constraints, poorly trained teachers and trainers, and very little equipment&#13;
and materials), and finally poor planning for changing these attributes o f the system.&#13;
&#13;
45.      This sub-component will re-orient a select number o f institutions to be more responsive to the&#13;
needs o f the labor market, improve the quality o f the training provided, establish programs to help link&#13;
trainees to market opportunities, and rationalize programs and activities that are not in tune with the&#13;
above mentioned characteristics o f a w e l l developed TVET system. This re-orientation would be&#13;
undertaken through a sequence o f reform measures, each o f which will trigger a tranche-release t o&#13;
undertake the next set o f reform and rehabilitation activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l5Borrower's   expected contribution o f U S $ 3 million i s likely to be spent o n Sub-Component 2.2.&#13;
l6The   Technical School in Kabul i s being rehabilitated under support from KfW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           35&#13;
&amp;#12;46.    This sub-component i s deliberately kept flexible in an effort to ensure that new ideas and&#13;
developments can be incorporated with relative ease as it i s difficult to fully define the steps to be&#13;
undertaken in the reform process and predict the nature o f the partnerships that may emerge. For&#13;
example, discussions are already underway for the establishment o f a Construction Trade Training Center&#13;
in Mazar e Sharif to be jointly managed by the Afghan Chamber o f Commerce (Mazar branch) and MOE,&#13;
and similar discussions are underway for the involvement o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and support from&#13;
the Government o f the Netherlands for development o f programs in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Mechanism for Self-selection: Three broad measures will have t o be agreed t o by each institute&#13;
to become eligible for program participation - (1) limiting training to focus sectors, (2) agreeing to re-&#13;
orient the institutes by expanding stakeholder involvement and serving community and industry at large&#13;
      i igradually declining government contribution to the overall operating budget o f the institute&#13;
and ( i )&#13;
beginning in Year 3.&#13;
&#13;
             Focus Sectors: The first set o f reforms will involve (a) the narrowing down the sectors or&#13;
             occupational areas in which training will be provided and (b) converting mono-trade schools to&#13;
             multi-trade schools. The focus sectors have been identified based on perceived needs o f the&#13;
             market and includes at present: (i)      management and administration, (ii)   accounting, (iii)&#13;
                                                                                                            ICT,&#13;
             (iv) basic engineering s k i l l s (such construction related trades, metal work, and mechanical&#13;
             repairs), and (v) agriculture and related sub-sectors. Training outside o f these areas should be&#13;
             phased out.&#13;
&#13;
         0   Stakeholder Involvement: This reform measure needs t o be adopted before program&#13;
             participation i s triggered. The purpose o f this reform i s to encourage the active participation o f&#13;
             industry, private sector enterprises, and other key stakeholders in the management and guiding&#13;
             o f the institute's activities.&#13;
&#13;
         0   Gradually Declining Government S u p ~ o r t :Institute directors, faculty, staff and students agree&#13;
             t o declining support from Government beginning in Year 3. This will ensure that under a&#13;
             decentralized management framework, Institute management will liaise closely with the needs&#13;
             o f the private sector and begin t o develop channels o f alternative financing".&#13;
&#13;
48.      All institutions that subscribe to and implement these reform measures will be eligible to&#13;
participate in the next stage o f the reform program in terms of: (i)&#13;
                                                                    physical and equipment rehabilitation&#13;
and upgradation, (ii)                                                                  i ideveloping,&#13;
                       training o f administrative, management and faculty personnel, ( i )&#13;
adapting, and adopting course content, curriculum, standards, and teaching-learning materials, (iv)&#13;
establish internship and placement programs for trainees, (v) the development o f tools to monitor the&#13;
process o f transformation, and (vi) adoption o f a continuing program o f quality management an assurance&#13;
in line with the prescriptions o f the NVETB in these regards.&#13;
&#13;
49.      Physical and Eauipment Rehabilitation and Upmadation: M o s t buildings and campuses are in&#13;
need o f renovation and physical rehabilitation due to conflict related damage, lack o f maintenance, and&#13;
poor quality construction. The project will finance the upgradation o f existing buildings and the&#13;
construction o f new learning spaces and workshopsAaboratories as needed to carry-out training functions.&#13;
The program will also finance stop-gap measures needed to accommodate students in other facilities&#13;
while their institutes are being rehabilitated. Preliminary estimates for the rehabilitation o f a `generic'&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
   W h i l e the current Constitution o f the country ensures free education and training, this w i l l either require an&#13;
amendment or the MOE would have to contract in a private partner who w i l l have the authority to charge fees for&#13;
training programs. An initial amount o f merit scholarships w i l l be agreed with the Government for a three year&#13;
period and beyond this negotiated every year during supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            36&#13;
&amp;#12;institution has been made and it i s believed that depending upon the specific conditions o f each institute, a&#13;
maximum o f ten institutes may be accommodated under this first batch. This i s also a good opportunity t o&#13;
develop flexible learning spaces and engage in partnership arrangements with industry to allow for cost-&#13;
effective programs.&#13;
&#13;
50.       The project will also finance the purchase o f equipment, tools, and other consumables needed to&#13;
provide training. Specifically, the will include such things as furniture, tools and equipment, computers&#13;
and related peripherals, and other fixtures and equipment as may be needed (such as, access to V S A T&#13;
facilities, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
5 1.     Training o f Administrative, Management and Faculty Personnel: Administrative and&#13;
management capacity within the institutions i s very weak and will be strengthened in t w o ways -by&#13;
expanding the management team to include participation o f external partners from private and NGOs&#13;
sector, and through direct recruitment o f new personnel with the necessary capacities and training o f&#13;
existing personnel. Specifically, administrative and management capacity building will include training in&#13;
areas such as strategic planning, annual planning, budgeting, procurement and finance, labor market&#13;
assessment and o n h o w to promote the institute to stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
52.      Faculty and trainers will be specifically trained to deliver courses which incorporate revised&#13;
curriculum, standards, and newly developed instructional materials. Furthermore, pedagogical training&#13;
will be an important part in the faculty and training o f trainers program. The emphasis o n TOT in the Sub-&#13;
component 2.1, will also help ensure a steady f l o w o f teachers and trainers for the institutions being&#13;
rehabilitated through this sub-component.&#13;
&#13;
53.       Course Content: The project will finance the development o f course materials, teaching learning&#13;
materials, training manuals, teaching guides, and other consumables needed for training, and will ensure&#13;
that all o f the above dovetail into Component 1 that will help develop clear guidelines o n standard setting&#13;
and levels/volume o n the NQF. Specifically, with regards t o the teaching learning material such as books&#13;
and manuals, efforts will be made to minimize duplication o f efforts through the adoption o f what already&#13;
exists in the public domain either in the country or in neighboring countries".&#13;
&#13;
54.      Student Internships and Placement: Each institute being financed through this project will&#13;
establish a placement cell in order to build close linkages with the market and industry. Internship&#13;
assignments or apprenticeship programs must be a defined and compulsory part o f every student's work&#13;
programlg. The responsibility o f these cells would be t o prepare the trainee adequately for school-to-work&#13;
transition, inform her o f the opportunities that exist in the labor market, identification and purchase o f&#13;
appropriate tool k i t s for trainees completing their program o f learning, and develop and maintain close&#13;
links between the institute and employers in the schools vicinity and elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
55.      Promam Monitoring: Once the institutes to receive financing through this project have been&#13;
short-listed, an elaborate project monitoring system would have to be developed to ensure that the&#13;
transformation from a supply driven program to an institute that i s responsive to the needs o f i t s&#13;
surroundings, i s invested in the trainees future, and measures success only through the performance o f i t s&#13;
&#13;
" Text books available in Iran lend themselves (with minimal alterations) for easy use in Afghanistan given the&#13;
proximity between Farsi and D a r i languages. Many o f these books have recently begun to come into the bazaars in&#13;
Kabul and are readily available for student use.&#13;
19&#13;
   Whether the internship comes at the end o f an extended period o f study, for example for students in accounting&#13;
programs, or whether the student's course o f study consists o f a couple o f months in class, followed by a 3 months&#13;
on-the-job training, followed by another few months in class, etc. (as might be the case in classes o n masonry,&#13;
construction, brick laying, etc.) would be for the institute's reformed management to decide. This would also apply&#13;
to Sub-Component 2.1,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         37&#13;
&amp;#12;students in the labor market can be carefully tracked. This will allow for rapid scaling up o f the program,&#13;
and for simultaneously ensuring that all bottlenecks that may arise can be quickly and effectively&#13;
mitigated.&#13;
&#13;
56.      The MOE will develop a detailed guidance document on what the reforms and rehabilitation&#13;
package will include and state the initial conditions and undertakings that have to be met by institutions&#13;
intending to participate in the program. The MOE will then review the responses o f the individual&#13;
institutions and decide upon institution specific strategies and action programs with the institute.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.3: Management Reforms in DTVET (Total $0.5 million, IDA $0.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
57.      This sub-component aims to support reforms within the DTVET t o ensure that: (i) various&#13;
                                                                                             the&#13;
departments and personnel within DTVET develop a better understanding o f the structure and functioning&#13;
o f modem TVET systems; (ii)    become more responsive t o market needs and accountable for effective&#13;
vocational training delivery through institutions under their control, and ( i ) administrative&#13;
                                                                            i ithe&#13;
procedures within DTVET are re-oriented in terms o f the wider responsibilities that the implementation o f&#13;
the project will entail.&#13;
&#13;
58.      Specifically, the reform measure t o be implemented through this sub-component focuses o n&#13;
achieving a TVET management system that i s decentralized. As has been mentioned earlier, the TVET&#13;
system in Afghanistan as it exists n o w i s a very centralized structure, with little t o n o r o o m at the&#13;
institution level both administratively and financially to be able to take decisions critical t o the survival&#13;
and functioning o f such institutions in a reformed TVET environment. By further delegating roles and&#13;
responsibilities in management and administration to the institution- level. It i s expected that the&#13;
institutes will become more responsive to the specific needs o f i t s clients in the community and private&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
59.       These reforms will entail a review o f all staffing, responsibilities and occupational standards, and&#13;
other procedures to streamline the delivery o f services from the DTVET. The Government has expressed&#13;
an interest in having a decentralized framework for TVET, and has explicitly stated that it wishes that by&#13;
the end o f Year 5, that there would only be a loose relationship between the Ministry and the institutions&#13;
under i t s purview. The specific focus o f this sub-component would be to help and trace out the changes&#13;
needed at the Department over time to achieve such a loose relationship between the DTVET and the&#13;
institutions. In as much as the DTVET i s an important institutional set-up in the TVET sector, it i s the&#13;
responsibility o f this Directorate to ensure a seamless integration between internal DTVET reforms and&#13;
external structural changes brought about through the creation o f the ANQA, the NVETB, and the&#13;
development o f the NQF. Therefore, internal reforms shall be designed and implemented t o support&#13;
overall project objectives. Such reforms will include building capacity within the DTVET for framing&#13;
administrative policy o n the basis o f Monitoring and Evaluation studies carried out by various agencies&#13;
and units o n the effectiveness and progress o f the TVET system. Lastly, this sub-component will focus&#13;
o n the M I S needs o f the DTVET and the I T infrastructure needed to support it.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Skills Development Program and Market Linkages with a Rural Focus (Total $5.0&#13;
             million, IDA $5.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
60.     This component aims to support a slice o f the on-going activities by the National Skills&#13;
Development Program, and simultaneously build the capacity within NSDP and M O L S A M D to&#13;
undertake reforms in technical and vocational training, labor market assessments, and t o strengthen&#13;
industrial and market linkages. The three program subcomponents follow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       38&#13;
&amp;#12;Sub-Component 3.1: Contracted Vocational Training Packages (Total $3.0 million, I D A $3.0&#13;
                    million)&#13;
&#13;
61.      This component will contract out to training providers market driven training for wage- and self-&#13;
employment. Training providers will be chosen competitively and their performance formatively&#13;
monitored. Training will be based on localized labor market studies and will typically cover trades in the&#13;
agriculture (including horticulture, animal husbandry, apiculture and market gardens), construction sector&#13;
and fabrication, etc. Where training relates to self-employment, BDS training and facilitative links to&#13;
micro-finance will be provided. This sub-component builds on existing training programs facilitated by&#13;
the NSDP. In the current Afghan government's FY, the NSDP i s facilitating more than U S $ 10 million&#13;
dollars worth o f training programs in about 24 provinces across the country. This i s done through&#13;
contracts primarily with 6-7 main training providers, most o f whom are established as NGOs. By&#13;
building on an existing model o f training, the project will ensure speedy implementation. However, by&#13;
focusing on training needs in rural areas and by rigorously evaluating the program, the project will help to&#13;
develop much needed information on training needs and impacts in rural areas and on specific target&#13;
populations.&#13;
&#13;
62.    The specific focus within this sub-component would be on: (i) Youth development, (ii)&#13;
`Chronically Poor Women'*', and (iii) Marginal farmers and landless farm laborers.&#13;
&#13;
                Youth DeveloDment: This activity will be targeted at youth, particularly those who have&#13;
                missed out on educational and training opportunities, with the aim to provide them with&#13;
                market driven vocational and business development training. Such training will not only&#13;
                provide them with a toe-hold on the ladder o f life-long learning but could contribute to&#13;
                their own, and families' livelihood. This i s particularly true in a post-conflict setting,&#13;
                where the concern lies in the fact that male youth, unable to find employment, will&#13;
                become disenchanted and demoralized and become a security risk.&#13;
&#13;
                Chronically Poor Women: Given nearly three decades o f conflict and social and cultural&#13;
                mores, the plight o f women in Afghanistan i s more difficult to address than in some o f&#13;
                the neighboring countries. L o w labor force participation rates o f women, suggest that any&#13;
                educational and training interventions aimed at improving income earning opportunities,&#13;
                and to eke out a livelihood, would have to focus on activities that can be done within the&#13;
                personal confines o f one's home. Recent research studies, commissioned by JICA and&#13;
                GTZ, provide some focus on how to identify and work more effectively with extremely&#13;
                poor women.&#13;
&#13;
                Marginal Farmers: Key areas o f interventions have been defined and will support the&#13;
                introduction o f improved farming methodologies, increased yields and better marketing&#13;
                o f farm produce. Technical assistance to support the development o f a comprehensive set&#13;
                of curriculum and facilitation-of-training materials at an entry level (into the NQF),&#13;
                covering key agriculture-sector topics such as: Horticulture, Food processing, Cash Crop&#13;
                Farming, Ecosystem protection, Livestock Restocking, Aquatic Farming, Plant&#13;
                Protection. These materials will be designed to be accessible by marginal farmers.&#13;
                Trainer farmers, drawn from the same f a m i n g communities, will be trained in the use o f&#13;
                these highly accessible learning materials and will work with groups o f marginal farmers&#13;
                on their own land, to introduce the new farming methodologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
''Terminology used by the ANDS.&#13;
                                                    39&#13;
&amp;#12;63.     Training will be contracted out to reputable agencies with expertise in the area o f WET, and who&#13;
are capable o f delivering well-focused, market driven vocational and business development training&#13;
interventions, sensitive to the needs o f the youth, and which will lead to wage- and self-employment. The&#13;
NSDP mandates in the contracts with training providers the percentage o f trainees to be in self- or waged-&#13;
employment within a certain number o f months after the completion o f the program, and tracks this&#13;
through systematic tracer studies.&#13;
&#13;
64.       T o make the program impacts more explicit, the NSDP has agreed t o stipulate in their contracting&#13;
procedures with training agencies the need for a randomized allocation o f potential trainees into treatment&#13;
and control groups and to periodically track the two groups over time to determine the impact o f training&#13;
on labor market outcomes for people receiving training and a comparable control group. This more&#13;
rigorous evaluation method will be applied beginning next month in the next round o f NSDP training&#13;
facilitation, even though we will not be financing this activity.&#13;
&#13;
65.     Training will be conducted through a combination o f workplace or centre-based training, or&#13;
mixtures o f both (on-the-job/off-the-job `dual'-system training). All training will be underpinned and&#13;
supported through a focus on essential competencies, specifically, literacy and numeracy.&#13;
&#13;
66.      Trainees in the area o f business development services (BDS), could be further provided with&#13;
follow-up business incubation support training and intervention. In these cases the NSDP supports the&#13;
procurement o f independent and registered Business Development Service (BDS) providers to provide&#13;
B D S training and facilitate the essential linkage to sources o f finance - such as savings, revolving funds&#13;
and microfinance.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 3.2: Training of Trainers Program (Total $1.5 million, IDA $1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
67.           Contracted training for Productive Skills Officers (PSOs), Business Development Service (BDS)&#13;
trainers, and selected trade trainers; and the development o f a menu o f 15-20 contextualized productive&#13;
s k i l l s curriculum materials, through competitively selected public and private/NGO training providers, or&#13;
consortia o f providers, to support the USAID-funded Learning and Community Empowerment Project 2&#13;
(LCEP2).&#13;
&#13;
68.            The PSOs will do the following: (i)      Assessing the employment market and marketing&#13;
                                                      i)&#13;
opportunities in the community districts, ( iLocating training venues and trainers for the delivery o f the&#13;
productive slulls elements, ( i )     i iAssisting the literacy teachers and members o f the Community&#13;
Development Councils in ensuring that the productive skills training i s seamlessly linked to literacy&#13;
learning, and to viable livelihood improvement opportunities and (iv) providing guidance to selected&#13;
s l u l l s trainers in h o w to deliver first level skills development modules linked to literacy development.&#13;
&#13;
69.     LCEP 2 i s a USAID-funded project which will support the development o f communities through&#13;
a combination o f literacy and productive skills development. UN Habitat has identified the lead agency&#13;
to implement the LCEP2, which will be delivered through the Ministry o f Education's (MoE's) Literacy&#13;
Department. The key aim here i s t o adopt key lessons learned form global research on acquisition o f&#13;
functional literacy, and deliver much more effective literacy development courses by linking them to&#13;
productive slulls training.&#13;
&#13;
70.      The project will finance capacity building for LCEP2 through hnding the following productive&#13;
skills development project components by developing a range o f introductory Skills Development&#13;
curriculum modules suitable for: (i)   Trainees having very basic levels o f prior learning; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                                focus on a&#13;
wide range o f agricultural, horticultural, animal husbandry and food processing, and off-farm slulls, and&#13;
(iii)incorporating literacy-development guide notes for the trainer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      40&#13;
&amp;#12;Sub-component 3.3:       Capacity Building for NSDPMOLSAMD (Total $0.5 million, IDA $0.5&#13;
                         million)&#13;
&#13;
7 1. '    This sub-component will build the capacity within N S D P M O L S A M D in the following areas: (1)&#13;
curriculum and materials development, (ii)   strengthen the capacity within these organizations to collect,&#13;
collate, analyze and interpret labor market information and to support capacity building to carry out a&#13;
labor force survey jointly with the CSO; and (iii) train up to 10 key personnel from among the actors&#13;
                                                   will&#13;
involved in TVET planning, management and outreach from the NSDP, MOLSAMD, and MOE. I                 n&#13;
addition, the sub-component will finance capacity development through study tours to countries in the&#13;
region and beyond to obtain a better understanding o f how modem TVET systems exist and operate.&#13;
Three comparative study visits (Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Iran), consisting o f four NSDP/(VET sector)&#13;
members o f staff for each visit. (Three separate groups o f four staff completing one study visit per&#13;
group.) Each group will follow the same pre-prepared study guidelines and then work together after the&#13;
visits to present a comparative overview o f TVET management systems for each country visited.&#13;
(Allocation will cover visits, associated planning and post-visit workshop activity.)&#13;
&#13;
72.      Curriculum and Materials Development Specialist: The project will finance high quality,&#13;
international, Technical Assistance in the area o f Curriculum and Materials Development. Expert will&#13;
develop the curriculum and standards in grassroots agricultural training, and training facilitation&#13;
materials, suitable for very poor farmers having l o w levels o f basic education, and work closely with all&#13;
other organizations that undertake similar work, such as, MAIL, MRRD, FAO, and other organizations&#13;
and offices. Widespread consultation and dissemination will have to be undertaken with practitioners,&#13;
government, private sector and other entities to ensure an adoption o f standards and levels described.&#13;
Level descriptors from the N Q F can be used to develop the volume and duration o f such training&#13;
programs so that a coherent set o f training standards can be developed.&#13;
&#13;
73.      Labor Market Information Specialist: The project will finance an international consultant, for a&#13;
six-month period to provide technical assistance to support the professional competence and development&#13;
o f a team o f data collection and processing managers and analysts attached to the newly established Labor&#13;
Market Information and Analysis Unit (LMIAU) under the MOLSAMD.&#13;
&#13;
74.     Training in TVET ManaPement and Administration: The project will finance accredited Distance&#13;
Learning programs o f study in the area o f TVET management and administration for individuals involved&#13;
in the management o f the existing W E T system in the country. This will include individuals from the&#13;
NSDP, MOLSAMD, MOE and other ministries and organizations as appropriate. The training will be&#13;
through an informal distance learning program and can be designed to suit the needs o f each individual.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: Research, Monitoring&amp; Evaluation (Total $1.0 million, IDA $1.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
75.     The objective o f this component i s to develop a program monitoring and information system that&#13;
will provide routine, timely, and accurate information on program implementation and allow for the&#13;
measurement o f longer term impacts and independent research.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 4.1: Monitoring and Decision Support (Total $0.4 million, IDA $0.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
76.     This sub-component will put in place monitoring and information systems to measure program&#13;
progress. Information generated by the monitoring system (and other relevant data) will be used as input&#13;
for a decision support mechanism which will identify alternatives and recommend course-corrections in&#13;
program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     41&#13;
&amp;#12;77.     The monitoring o f program implementation, outputs and outcomes will be done by the DTVET&#13;
and NSDP for Component 2 and 3 respectively. Specifically, in the case MOE, while the DTVET will be&#13;
primarily responsible, it will work in close cooperation with the DOP o f MOE and develop key&#13;
monitoring instruments within the EMIS fkamework. Development o f data collection tools will be&#13;
designed, piloted and implemented and within 6 months o f project effectiveness a thorough baseline will&#13;
be developed for all 42 institutions under DTVET's jurisdiction. T h i s information will be updated every&#13;
year, and the project will finance the necessary investments needed to provide this, including computers,&#13;
experts to further develop and implement the E M I S system, and establish clear and concise reporting&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
78.      With respect t o NSDP, instruments will be developed to monitor and evaluate the program&#13;
through the course o f the project. This will include developing a good understanding o f participants&#13;
before, during training and after training participation in the labor market. The project will also finance&#13;
the further strengthening o f the M&amp;E team under the NSDP both through technical assistance and through&#13;
the provision o f key goods and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Component 4.2: Impact Evaluation (Total $0.6 million, IDA $0.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
79.      This sub-component will conduct impact evaluations o n specific sub-components in relationship&#13;
to stated program objectives and identified key performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
80.     The E M I S team will also be trained by experts to help develop the necessary procedures for&#13;
sampling, randomization in initial admissions processes, and methods and procedures t o carry out tracer&#13;
studies o f both those in the eligible and randomly selected and trained cell, and others in the eligible,&#13;
randomly chosen not to be selected for training, and not trained at the specific institute.&#13;
&#13;
8 1.    Though the target populations for the training under the DTVET and the N S D P might be very&#13;
different the method to be applied for the evaluation o f program impacts are very similar and for this&#13;
purpose please refer to Annex 5 o n project supervision for a detailed lay-out o f h o w program impacts will&#13;
be evaluated.&#13;

                                                           43&#13;
&amp;#12;                          Annex 5: IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
1.      Institutional Set-Up: The education and training sector cuts across ministerial boundaries and&#13;
involves MOE, N S D P h I O L S A M D , and MOHE. The Bank team intends to work with all three ministries&#13;
mentioned above, though principally with the DTVET (MOE) and the NSDP (MOLSAMD). Given the&#13;
different objectives o f each component and specific roles o f a l l key stakeholders in i t s development and&#13;
implementation, it i s proposed that the implementation arrangements be designed in such a way as to limit&#13;
the need for coordination between these two principal ministries and in effect, ring-fence each component&#13;
from the other. As such, Component 2 will be implemented by the DTVET and Component 3 by NSDP.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Implementation Period: The project will be implemented over a period o f five year and six fiscal&#13;
years (World Bank) from March 1,2008 to February 28,2013.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Government's Capacity for Proiect Execution: The DTVET and NSDP PIU both have the&#13;
capacity t o take o n the responsibility o f the implementation and delivery o f this project. The Bank team&#13;
did consider other alternatives, such as, employing a Facilitating or Implementation Partner to manage&#13;
and help implement the entire project. This idea was discarded in favor o f using Government systems to&#13;
implement, which will simultaneously help further build capacity within the Government to undertake&#13;
such tasks in the future. Furthermore, in a post-conflict setting, there i s a critical need t o explicitly&#13;
demonstrate that the Government i s both in control and capable o f taking key decisions aimed at&#13;
improving the lives and welfare o f the population and as such, an interest in visibly establishing&#13;
Government presence across the country.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Implementation Arrangements: N o new Program Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established&#13;
for the execution o f this project. Given the emergency nature o f the project, i t s strategic importance, the&#13;
large number o f activities to be completed within the time frame o f the project, and the s t i l l limited&#13;
capacity o f the government to be able to coordinate and monitor program implementation, the following&#13;
institutional arrangements have been agreed t o ensure that funds disburse quickly, multisectoral&#13;
objectives are reached, and transparency o f a l l transactions i s maintained.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Component 1 i s an institutional reform component and requires the participation of all the three&#13;
providing ministries - MOE, MOHE, and M O L S A M D . As stated earlier, The DTVET (MOE) will be&#13;
responsible for the implementation o f Component 2 and the NSDP's PIU will be responsible for&#13;
Component 3. These are the two principal service provision components. The DTVET and NSDP will be&#13;
responsible for Component 4, Research, Monitoring and Evaluation. These are described in greater detail&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
        a.       Execution o f Component 1: A Committee o n Education and Skills Policy will be&#13;
        established under the chairmanship o f the Vice President. It has been agreed between MOE,&#13;
        MOHE and M O L S A M D , that the NSDP PIU will take o n the responsibilities o f a Secretariat for&#13;
        the CESP. The CESP will comprise o f the Vice President, representatives o f MOE, MOHE and&#13;
        M O L S A M D , a representative o f MOF, two members representing the private sector, and t w o&#13;
        members representing the donor community (on a revolving basis). A Designated Officer o f the&#13;
        N S D P will be the Secretary to the CESP, but without the rights o f a full member. All ministerial&#13;
        representation will be at the level o f the Minister, with their deputies being identified as the&#13;
        alternates on the committee. The Secretariat so established will be responsible for all&#13;
        administrative and management functions o f the CESP - including the hiring o f technical experts&#13;
        needed to draft legal documents needed for the establishment o f new, statutory, regulatory&#13;
        structures, and for the development o f the NQF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      44&#13;
&amp;#12;b.      The agreement to use the NSDP as the Secretariat initially for the CESP i s reflected in a&#13;
Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) between the three concerned ministries and the MOF.&#13;
This Secretariat will be responsible for overall coordination o f Component 1. The Secretariat will&#13;
particularly ensure coordination across government, donors, and user-agencies which will be a&#13;
key requirement for a sustainable and smooth multi-year programmatic approach to building the&#13;
TVET capacity in the country. A designated officer o f the NSDP will oversee the program, with&#13;
the assistance o f several short-term, international consultants and longer-term national consultants&#13;
all chosen competitively.&#13;
&#13;
C.      The CESP-Secretariat will work in close coordination with the concerned departments&#13;
(such as DTVET) and other relevant ministries and agencies involved in TVET. T h e main&#13;
function o f the Secretariat i s to facilitate the implementation o f Component 1. I t i s also&#13;
responsible for: (a) assuring steady progress o f execution in accordance to an implementation&#13;
schedule reviewed and approved by the World Bank; (b) regular reporting to the CESP; and (c)&#13;
ensuring that a high ethical standard and transparency i s maintained throughout the process.&#13;
&#13;
d.       Execution o f Component 2: The DTVET i s a fully established department within the&#13;
M O E with a total staff o f about 2460 across the country with about 140 staff members managing&#13;
the Department headquarters in Kabul. A Grants Management Unit within the MOE, which i s&#13;
responsible for all donor-funded projects in MOE, will play the main fiduciary roles related&#13;
program activities, such as, all procurement, financial management and reporting as well as all&#13;
project related coordination with other line departments, such as, planning and M&amp;E. All&#13;
construction and works related aspects o f this component would be handled by the Department o f&#13;
Construction (DOC) o f the MOE. This would include overall technical guidance on institute&#13;
rehabilitation and construction. While the DTVET has i t s own Department o f Planning, the&#13;
project proposes that the overall responsibility for monitoring will lie with the MOE's&#13;
Department o f Planning (DOP). All DTVET schools will be included in the E M I S data collection&#13;
program so that an annual update on all the students through these programs can be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
e.        Provincial Institutes: Institutes in the provinces will continue to be supported directly by&#13;
the DTVET as i s done now. However, in terms o f fund flows and personnel decisions, the roles&#13;
o f the provincial education departments (PEDS)and other officers o f the MOE (such as the&#13;
engineering staff in the DOC, etc.,) will come into play. While it i s anticipated that under the&#13;
reform package stated in Component 2.2, schools will gain increasing autonomy as the DTVET&#13;
moves to a more decentralized management style, the impacts o f such developments on&#13;
implementation arrangements i s necessarily vague. The MOF has agreed to allow the institutions&#13;
selected from the 42 institutions under the DTVET to have and access imprest bank accounts to&#13;
help ensure operation autonomy and flexibility in the implementation o f programs. However, this&#13;
more laissez-faire management style will have to be supported with intensive monitoring o f&#13;
project implementation and outcomes, and evaluation o f program success.&#13;
&#13;
f.      Execution o f Component 3: Implementation o f Component 3 would be the sole&#13;
responsibility o f the NSDP PIU. As this component i s only a slice o f the activities o f the NSDP,&#13;
the same procedures will be followed for program implementation as are being done today. The&#13;
NSDP already employs procurement and financial management processes that conform to Bank&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
g.        The NSDP, while linked to M O L S A M D has been given relative freedom and&#13;
independence by the Ministry to chart their own course. Nevertheless, MOLSAMD plays a&#13;
critical role in the fbnctioning o f the NSDP, as the Chairperson o f the NSDP Steering Committee&#13;
(NSDPSC) i s also the Minister o f MOLSAMD. The NSDP, as an NPP, has a direct budget line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             45&#13;
&amp;#12;       from the MOF. The authority to clear all o f NSDP activities rests with the Chairperson o f the&#13;
       NSDPSC. All training contracts are approved by the Chairperson o f the NSDP, but are monitored&#13;
       by the NSDP PIU.&#13;
&#13;
        h.      Execution o f Component 4: T h i s component will be implemented by DTVET and NSDP&#13;
        respectively for all monitoring o f project activities, while the ministries will outsource evaluation&#13;
        work to third parties.&#13;
&#13;
        i.      The oversight function for all projects implemented by M O E i s performed by a senior&#13;
        management group, which consist o f the Minister, the Deputy Ministers, the head o f GMU, and&#13;
        other advisers as deemed necessary. T h i s oversight body meets regularly (at least twice monthly)&#13;
        to review overall project implementation progress, and are also responsible for review and&#13;
        approval o f annual work plans and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
       j.       The oversight function for the NSDP will be performed by the a steering committee,&#13;
       which i s made up o f representatives from 11 line ministries and chaired by the Minister o f Labor,&#13;
       Social Affairs and Martyred and Disabled. The steering committee will meet at least every&#13;
       quarter to review overall project implementation progress, and are also responsible for review and&#13;
       approval o f annual work plans and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
        k.      The Grant Management Unit o f the Ministry o f Education and the Finance Department o f&#13;
        NSDP will be responsible for the financial management o f their respective project components.&#13;
        They will carry out day-to-day financial management operations o f the project, preparation o f M-&#13;
        16 forms (payment orders), project coding sheet, B27 allotment form and overall contract and&#13;
        project management.&#13;
&#13;
6.        The project preparation team considered the establishment o f a joint program coordination unit&#13;
that would span both MOE and NSDPMOLSAMD, but then decided against this idea with the realization&#13;
that it may be better for implementation purposes to limit the need for coordination across the various&#13;
entities.&#13;
&#13;
Donor Support and Coordination&#13;
&#13;
7.      Component 2 o f the project i s also supported by USAID (parallel financing) and the Government&#13;
o f Norway (co-financing). In a recent M O U signing, between USAID, the Governments o f Norway and&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
8.       The monitoring systems for the Components 2 and 3 exist, to varying degrees, in their respective&#13;
organizations. The monitoring o f programs in the M O E has been considerably strengthened in the past 10&#13;
months and the NSDP's monitoring efforts have been commendable with the conduct o f periodic tracer&#13;
studies to determine the usefulness and impacts o f these training programs. These are described in some&#13;
detail below.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Monitoring o f M O E TVET Promams: A recent census by the MOE has begun to provide&#13;
information on the number o f students in DTVETs programs around the country. However, there are no&#13;
clear policies on monitoring and evaluation in the DTVET and the department has not maintained any&#13;
centralized, computerized, information on the nearly 11,000 student in their programs. As part o f this&#13;
project, the DTVETMOE have committed to strengthening the M&amp;E o f TVET programs through a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     46&#13;
&amp;#12;centralized M&amp;E department for the whole ministry, rather than a stand-alone M&amp;E unit for the DTVET&#13;
department. The DTVET will become the repository o f this information, but the collection, processing,&#13;
analysis, and interpretation o f this data will be done by the more centralized M&amp;E unit within the MOE.&#13;
&#13;
10.     This will enable a regular updating o f records o f all students in the programs and proper&#13;
accounting o f their performance during the program and a follow-up o f graduates with respect to their&#13;
labor market outcomes through tracer studies 6-9 months after program completion. Furthermore, the&#13;
DTVET should also seek to benefit from the MOE's decision to develop a HR data base. T h i s will&#13;
provide information on availability o f trainers, their qualifications, the training they have received in&#13;
recent years, and the gaps in their skills sets that need to be filled.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Tracer Studies: Given the poor quality o f monitoring, it i s not surprising that the DTVET does&#13;
not conduct systematic tracer studies on students and their performance in the labor force, once they leave&#13;
the program. This leaves the DTVET very little means o f verifjmg the effectiveness o f training programs&#13;
offered through the institutions under the DTVET. The DTVET has agreed to conduct, by contracting out&#13;
to a qualified third-party, systematic tracer studies within a period o f 6-9 months after the completion o f&#13;
the trainees period o f study. The main aim o f this effort would be to determine the labor market outcomes&#13;
o f these individuals, and hence the success or failure o f the programs. In addition to this, the Bank team&#13;
has proposed to work closely with the DTVET to attempt to randomize students in to treatment and&#13;
control groups during their process o f application. This will be achieved from a l i s t o f all students eligible&#13;
for admission (assuming that there are more eligible candidates than those that can be admitted or that the&#13;
program has been over-subscribed) students will be randomly assigned to control and treatment groups.&#13;
Tracer studies will cover both sets o f students to try and determine the effectiveness o f the training&#13;
program on labor market outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Monitoring o f NSDP Facilitated Training A very tight and organized system o f monitoring&#13;
exists within the NSDP. The program has a fully staffed M&amp;E department and the training being carried&#13;
out (by contracted agencies that may be either government, nongovernment, or private institutions) i s&#13;
closely scrutinized. The monitoring officers visit and inspect contracted out training programs closely.&#13;
This scrutiny provides a reason for good performance, and lays the foundation stone for a good demand-&#13;
driven, labor market oriented program. The benchmark o f program success used by the NSDP till this&#13;
year has been to determine the proportion o f the graduates out o f their contracted research programs who&#13;
are employed within six months o f completing their training or have a job through self-employment&#13;
within the same period o f their completing the training.&#13;
&#13;
 13.     This i s typically achieved through tracer studies carried out by the NSDP team in an effort to&#13;
determine the labor market outcomes o f its trainees. Two rounds o f such tracer studies have been carried&#13;
out, typically within a period o f 6-9 months after the completion o f their studies. These studies provide&#13;
the basis for determining the success or failure o f the training programs since the NSDP's primary goal i s&#13;
to ensure that all trainees become more employable after the program, and hence improving their chances&#13;
for obtaining work andor being self-employed. As stated above, till date the measure o f program success&#13;
was defined by the percentage o f program participants who were gainfully employed or engaged in self-&#13;
employment opportunities. Through discussions with the Bank team it has been agreed that the NSDP&#13;
will now seek to obtain a more rigorous measure o f program impact. The NSDP, eager to demonstrate the&#13;
success o f their model o f training facilitation, have agreed to adopt a rigorous evaluation design beginning&#13;
this FY, though Bank financing will not be available by then. The section below outlines the approach to&#13;
be followed and i s applicable to training by the NSDP, and MOE, though the text below refers to NSDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       47&#13;
&amp;#12;Design for Evaluating Impacts of NSDP Facilitated Training Program&#13;
&#13;
14.      Sub-Components 3.1 and 3.2 o f the project a i m to contribute to the socio-economic recovery o f&#13;
Afghanistan through the provision o f a skills development and vocational education and training,&#13;
facilitated by the NSDP. It i s expected that these training programs offered will be responsive to labor&#13;
market needs and which will provide Afghan women and men with the knowledge and skills for decent&#13;
work through increased wage and self-employment opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
15.      In order to achieve this target, the N S D P relies strongly o n Implementing Partners (IP) f r o m&#13;
among NGOs and the private sector. These are selected based o n their quality and offered price for a&#13;
given project. In each round o f the program the N S D P announces, publicly, i t s intention to train a given&#13;
number o f trainees in a specific region and asks IPS o submit their technical and financial proposals22.&#13;
                                                                t&#13;
The technical proposals o f the IPS   must contain a labor market assessment, for the areas where they intend&#13;
to train23,as a justification for the type o f s k i l l s that they are willing to provide. Moreover, recruitment&#13;
and screening for the program all are conducted by the selected IPS.             These IPS provide information to the&#13;
public through outreach activities, screen applicants to ensure that they meet the eligibility criteria and&#13;
assign eligible candidates to classes.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Although this procedure i s not without i t s limitations, it is, probably, the fastest way to reach the&#13;
NSDP objectives in Afghanistan where the lack o f useful and timely information to all actors in the&#13;
vocational education and training system i s evident. However, there i s not any effort to study the&#13;
effectiveness o f the trainings o n employment and welfare status o f the participants to help making&#13;
informed decision about program expansion or even i t s termination.&#13;
&#13;
17.      This research i s intended t o devise a method for estimating the causal impact o f the N S D P&#13;
training programs on participants' earnings and work opportunities. A social experiment where the&#13;
eligible participants are randomly assigned t o treatment and control groups will be carried out.&#13;
Econometrics methods will be used t o estimate the difference between the responses o f those in the&#13;
treatment group and those in the control group and this i s the estimated effect o f the training.&#13;
&#13;
Main Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
18,       The a priori belief i s that:&#13;
&#13;
      0   The earning o f the treatment group i s significantly greater than the earning o f the control group&#13;
      0   Participation in the training program improves the chance and the quality o f employment.&#13;
&#13;
Methodology and Data Sources&#13;
&#13;
19.       The overall impact analysis i s designed t o examine two major types o f outcome measures:&#13;
&#13;
      0   Employment and earnings&#13;
      0   Dependence o n family, welfare and or public transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22 In the recent call for proposals (2007), for example, the NSDP has divided the country into seven regions and&#13;
asked the interested IPSt o submit proposals for training o f 1400 individuals, on average, for each region.&#13;
23 Even, if the training is designed for remote rural areas, the labor market assessment can be part o f the contracted&#13;
activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          48&#13;
&amp;#12;20.      Employment and earnings outcomes indicators provide a key summary o f the quality o f an&#13;
applicant's post-program employment experiences, and allows for inference on the effectiveness of the&#13;
training program. Other indicators collected will provide information o n trainees and control group&#13;
individuals personal, household and other characteristics, thereby providing means to understand the&#13;
manner in which the benefits o f training accrue to various participants.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Since the interest i s to correctly estimate the effect o f the program on the beneficiaries, the&#13;
counterfactual o f interest i s the outcome that would have been observed for the beneficiaries, after the&#13;
program took place, had they not participated in the program. The evaluation problem exists because we&#13;
only observe persons either in the state o f the world where they participate in a program or in the state o f&#13;
the world where they do not, but never both.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Various methods o f dealing with this problem can be found in the literature. One possibility i s to&#13;
assess the counterfactual using a control group o f non-participants matched on observable characteristics&#13;
or some scalar aggregate o f those characteristics, such as the propensity score matching (following&#13;
Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). An alternative approach i s to use an instrumental-variables estimator, in&#13;
which the instrumental variable (IV) identifies the exogenous variation in participation. Naturally these&#13;
non-experimental methods require assumptions to make up for the missing data on outcomes in the&#13;
absence o f the intervention. Matching on the basis o f propensity scores requires the conditional&#13;
independence (sometimes called "strong ignorability") assumption, namely that outcomes are&#13;
independent o f participation given the observable covariates. Instrumental- variables methods require an&#13;
alternative conditional independence assumption, namely the exclusion restriction that the IV i s&#13;
uncorrelated with outcomes given participation and the control variables.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Randomization i s often considered to be the gold-standard for evaluation designs in that it&#13;
balances the distributions o f all (observed or unobserved) covariates between the treatment and control&#13;
groups. If everyone who was given access to the training automatically took it up and access was assigned&#13;
randomly then we would have n o difficulty estimating the impact on those treated by comparing&#13;
measured outcomes with those observed for the randomized-out control group. Under weak conditions, an&#13;
unbiased estimate o f mean impact for those treated can then be obtained by taking the mean difference in&#13;
the outcome measure (employment say) between the treatment and control groups. This i s equivalent to&#13;
the regression coefficient o f the outcome measure on a dummy variable for which group one belongs to&#13;
(treatmentlcontrol). This provides an unbiased estimate o f impact because this dummy variable i s&#13;
exogenous given randomization and full compliance.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Thus, the data will come from a controlled, randomized experiment. Most participant data will be&#13;
descriptive in nature, such as age, gender, education, prior occupational training, work history, wages,&#13;
determination toward work, assets and herhim household socio-economic characteristics. Some data,&#13;
however, will be measures o f variables related to program objectives. These data will be compared to data&#13;
collected at completion o f the program to determine effects. We will use the following steps for collecting&#13;
the data:&#13;
&#13;
        .   To make sure all eligible candidates are aware o f the program, NSDP training contractors use&#13;
            all national and local media to inform people o f their intent to provide training facilitated by&#13;
            the NSDP. The eligibility conditions are set according to the NSDP goals and are precise&#13;
            enough to be understood by everyone and minimize ambiguities in the selection process.&#13;
            Moreover, at the day o f registration, all applicants will be briefed about the programs and&#13;
            courses offered, possible number o f applicants, and the finite capacity for each course, and&#13;
            the criteria on which the final set o f trainees will be selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                      49&#13;
&amp;#12;        .   The registration i s local and will be conducted by the evaluation team. A questionnaire will&#13;
            be given to each applicant, containing questions o n the following: (i)  personal information&#13;
            and their interests; (ii)employment and employment histories; ( i )i ihousehold characteristics;&#13;
            and (iv) community variables. Staff will be trained to help fill in the forms for those who are&#13;
            illiterate.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Random Allocation to Training: These data in these questionnaires will then be entered into a&#13;
computer data base, a l l eligible applicants will be assigned an x digit random number, and they will be&#13;
then sorted out according to a combination o f their region, gender and lottery number. The assignment o f&#13;
training will start with the applicant with the lowest lottery number for a given region and gender&#13;
category. The holder o f the lowest lottery number has this opportunity to register in hisher most favourite&#13;
course. The same procedure applies to the next lottery numbers.&#13;
&#13;
26.      As the process continues, the courses will fill up and candidates have to register in their second&#13;
and third choices if they have not already filled up. The assignment continues until all classes have been&#13;
filled. The l i s t o f admitted applicants will be announced to the IPS enrolment and starting the classes.&#13;
                                                                        for&#13;
Those with "too high" lottery number and those who couldn't enrol in their most interested subject&#13;
constitute the first control group. The second control group will be matched by NRVA survey (or a&#13;
separate survey as may become available). This group must contain the eligible people who do not&#13;
participate.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Since the past experience shows that almost 70% o f not-selected applicants will return for the&#13;
next rounds o f training and probably part o f them will be selected in the future, it i s possible, as training&#13;
cycle goes on, to have another control group to investigate the dynamic effects o f training o n target&#13;
variables. The timetable o n the following page i s for the current set o f training contracts being issued by&#13;
NSDP. This round o f training i s being financed through the GOA'SOrdinary Budget, and not through&#13;
Bank financing. However, the NSDP has adopted the evaluation approach based o n an understanding that&#13;
the method i s superior. The timetable pertains t o the current training contracts and activities.&#13;

&amp;#12;       Annex 6: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial management&#13;
environment in Afghanistan through the large number o f projects under implementation over the past four&#13;
years. The Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP) i s the primary instrument to&#13;
continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put in place during the past years to help ensure&#13;
transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
2.      A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was developed by the&#13;
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership program was applied&#13;
in Afghanistan in June 2005. PEFA i s comprised o f the World Bank, IMF, EC, and several other&#13;
agencies. The system i s structured around six core dimensions o f PFM performance: i)      budget credibility,&#13;
ii)                                        i)&#13;
   comprehensiveness and transparency, i i policy-based budgeting, iv) predictability and control in&#13;
budget execution, v) accounting, recording, and reporting, and vi) external scrutiny and audit.&#13;
Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM performance indicators generally portray a public sector where&#13;
financial resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes. This has been accomplished&#13;
with very high levels o f support from international firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over&#13;
the medium term if these ratings are t o be maintained. There i s also much room for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3.        I spite o f undeniable gains made in reconstruction since the end o f 200 1, the challenges facing&#13;
          n&#13;
Afghanistan remain immense; not least because o f the tenuous security situation in the region and&#13;
continued prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks have not&#13;
yet been fully costed so various priorities are funded through the annual budgeting process. The rising&#13;
costs o f the security sector constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With&#13;
regard to executive oversight, the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All in all, the&#13;
new national strategy has created high expectations o f the executive which could prove to be quite&#13;
difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
4.        The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform i t s core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff in the civil service and the absence o f qualified&#13;
counterparts in the government after 30 years o f war and conflicts i s a binding constraint. Delays in&#13;
reforming the pay structure and grading o f civil servants have severely crippled the public administration&#13;
o f the country. Domestic revenues lag behind expenditures by a factor o f ten t o one. Large-scale&#13;
corruption could emerge to undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national&#13;
accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they&#13;
need rapid and substantial strengthening if progress toward the attainment o f national development targets&#13;
i s to be monitored. Currently, 75% o f external revenues bypass government appropriation systems.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The W o r l d Bank i s financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o f Finance,&#13;
an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audt Office, and a Procurement Advisor to assist in&#13;
Procurement-related activities. Also an Internal Audit function i s being developed within the Ministry o f&#13;
Finance with World Bank financing. USAID, and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance Program, i s financing&#13;
a team o f consultants and advisors t o assist the D a Afghanistan Bank in local as w e l l as foreign currency&#13;
operations. The activities carried out under the existing Public Administration projects have helped the&#13;
Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for public expenditures,&#13;
including those supported by the Bank and the donor community.&#13;
&#13;
6.     Progress has been slower than expected in shifting from operations support provided by the three&#13;
Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the c i v i l servants. Given that, i s expected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      52&#13;
&amp;#12;that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term. Challenges s t i l l remain in attaining&#13;
the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. And t o make matters more&#13;
complex, the regulatory environment in Afghanistan has advanced significantly in the past three years.&#13;
Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early environment does not fully qualify the civil&#13;
servants to work effectively in the new emerging environment.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Assessment and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
7.      The table below identifies the key risks that the project may face and indicates h o w these risks are&#13;
to be addressed. The overall FM risk rating i s high but the residual risk rating after application o f the&#13;
mitigating measures i s substantial.&#13;

    Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
    Strengths&#13;
&#13;
    8.       The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place t o&#13;
    ensure appropriate utilization o f funds w i l l not be circumvented. The Government support for PACBP i s&#13;
    strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury operations, public procurement, internal&#13;
    audit in the public sector, and external audit by the Auditor General.&#13;
&#13;
    9.      The key implementing line ministries, Ministry o f Education and Ministry o f Labor, Social&#13;
    Affairs and Martyred and Disabled have implemented some IDA-funded grants previously, so it has&#13;
    experience in implementing Bank projects and following Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
    Weaknesses and Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
    10.       The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, i s the ability to attract&#13;
    suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management. The utilization&#13;
    o f the services o f the Grant Management Unit (GMU) o f the Ministry o f Education (MOE), which has&#13;
    gained enormous experience f i o m previous and currently implemented Bank and other donor funded&#13;
    projects, presence o f qualified and experienced internationahational staff in GMU o f MOE and in&#13;
    NSDP, engagement o f additional staff in GMU o f MOE and in NSDP, together with intensive training&#13;
    programs included in this project, i s expected to strengthen the fiduciary arrangements.&#13;

&amp;#12;ImplementingEntity&#13;
&#13;
11.      Comuonent 1: A Committee o n Education and Skills Policy will be established under the&#13;
Chairmanship o f the Vice President. I t has been agreed between MOE, MOHE and M O L S A M D , that the&#13;
NSDP P I U will take o n the responsibilities o f a Secretariat for the CESP. The CESP will comprise o f the&#13;
Vice President, representatives o f MOE, MOHE and M O L S A M D , a representative o f MOF, two&#13;
members representing the private sector, and two members representing the donor community (on a&#13;
revolving basis). A Designated Officer o f the NSDP will be the Secretary t o the CESP, but without the&#13;
rights o f a full member. All ministerial representation will be at the level o f the Minister, with their&#13;
deputies being identified as the alternates on the committee. The Secretariat so established will be&#13;
responsible for all administrative and management functions of the CESP - including the hiring o f&#13;
technical experts needed t o draft legal documents needed for the establishment o f new, statutory,&#13;
regulatory structures, and for the development o f the NQF.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The agreement to use the NSDP as the Secretariat initially for the CESP i s reflected in a&#13;
Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) between the three concerned ministries and the MOF. This&#13;
Secretariat will be responsible for overall coordination o f Component 1, The Secretariat will particularly&#13;
ensure coordination across government, donors, and user-agencies which will be a key requirement for a&#13;
sustainable and smooth multi-year programmatic approach t o buildingthe W E T capacity in the country.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Component 2: The DTVET o f MOE will be responsible for the implementation o f this&#13;
component. The DTVET i s a fully established department within the MOE with a total staff o f about&#13;
2460 across the country with about 140 staff members managing the Department headquarters in Kabul.&#13;
A Grants Management Unit within the MOE, which i s responsible for all donor-funded projects in MOE,&#13;
will play the main fiduciary roles related program activities, such as, a l l procurement, financial&#13;
management and reporting as w e l l as all project related coordination with other line departments, such as,&#13;
planning and M&amp;E. All construction and works related aspects o f this component would be handled by&#13;
the Department o f Construction (DOC) o f the MOE. T h i s would include overall technical guidance o n&#13;
institute rehabilitation and construction. While the DTVET has i t s own Department o f Planning, the&#13;
project proposes that the overall responsibility for monitoring will l i e with the MOE's Department o f&#13;
Planning (DOP). All DTVET schools will be included in the E M I S data collection program so that an&#13;
annual update o n all the students through these programs can be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Component 3: Implementation o f Component 3 would be the sole responsibility o f the NSDP&#13;
PIU. As this component i s only a slice o f the activities o f the NSDP, the same procedures will be&#13;
followed for program implementation as are being done today as the NSDP already employs procurement&#13;
and financial management processes that conform to Bank guidelines. The NSDP, while linked to&#13;
M O L S A M D , i s independent o f the Ministry and has the relative freedom t o chart their course.&#13;
M O L S A M D plays a critical role in the functioning o f the NSDP, as the Chairperson o f the NSDP&#13;
Steering Committee (NSDPSC) i s the defacto Minister o f M O L S A M D . The NSDP, as an NPP, has a&#13;
direct budget line from the MOF. The authority to clear all o f NSDP activities rests with the Chairperson&#13;
of the NSDPSC. All training contracts are approved by the Chairperson o f the NSDP, but are monitored&#13;
by the NSDP PIU.&#13;
&#13;
15.    Component 4: This component will be implemented by DTVET and NSDP respectively for all&#13;
monitoring o f project activities, while the ministries will outsource evaluation work to third parties.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The oversight function for all projects implemented by MOE i s performed by a senior&#13;
management group, which consist o f the Minister, the Deputy Ministers, the head o f GMU, and other&#13;
advisers as deemed necessary. This oversight body meets regularly (at least twice monthly) to review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     56&#13;
&amp;#12;overall project implementation progress, and are also responsible for review and approval o f annual work&#13;
plans and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The oversight function for the NSDP will be performed by the a steering committee, which i s&#13;
made up o f representatives from 11 line ministries and chaired by the Minister o f Labor, Social Affairs&#13;
and Martyred and Disabled. The steering committee will meet at least every quarter to review overall&#13;
project implementation progress, and are also responsible for review and approval o f annual work plans&#13;
and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
18.      The Grant Management Unit o f the Ministry o f Education and the Finance Department o f NSDP&#13;
will be responsible for the financial management o f their respective project components. They will carry&#13;
out day-to-day financial management operations o f the project, preparation o f M-16 forms (payment&#13;
orders), project coding sheet, B27 allotment form and overall contract and project management.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
19.      The respective component implementingentity's budget committee will coordinate the&#13;
preparation o f annual work plan and the derivation o f annual budget. This committee will be made up o f&#13;
representatives from relevant departments o f the implementing entity, and shall report to the respective&#13;
implementingentity's oversight body. The Budget Committee shall also coordinate quarterly budget&#13;
reviews to ensure adequate budget discipline and control. The committee will be responsible for ensuring&#13;
that project expenditures for each fiscal year are captured in the Governmental Development budget o f&#13;
that fiscal year. The M O E &amp; NSDP must get approvals from the presidential office and the parliament&#13;
and attach them to B27 and PCS forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under the&#13;
project to avoid delays in payment processing.&#13;
&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
&#13;
20.      The standard funds flow mechanism in Afghanistan will be followed in this project. Project funds&#13;
will be deposited in the Designated Account (DA) to be opened and maintained at the D a Afghanistan&#13;
Bank (DAB). The DA, in keeping with Afghan law and current practice for other projects in Afghanistan,&#13;
will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury Department o f MoF. Requests&#13;
for payments from the DA will be made to the SDU by the implementing entities when needed.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                           Annex 7: PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Country Context&#13;
&#13;
1.     The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the procurement environment in&#13;
Afghanistan through i t s involvement in the interim procurement arrangements put in place through&#13;
Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP) as w e l l as with the institutions such as Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction and Development Services ( A R D S ) that i s holding the current responsibility for&#13;
government's procurement administration. As part o f the broader review o f Afghanistan's Public Finance&#13;
Management (PFM) system, the Bank recently carried out an assessment o f the procurement environment&#13;
in the country based on the baseline and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions l e d&#13;
by the W o r l d Bank and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
(0ECD)Development Assistance Committee (DAC).&#13;
&#13;
2.    The f i r s t key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need for ownership and a&#13;
champion in the Government for reform, deepening o f capacity, ensuring integrity in the operation o f&#13;
procurement systems, and promoting sound procurement among ministries.&#13;
&#13;
3.    A new Procurement L a w has been adopted in November 2005 which radically transforms the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework for the procurement administration o f Afghanistan. While it provides a very&#13;
modem legal system for procurement, effective implementation o f the l a w may encounter difficulties in&#13;
the current weak institutional structure and capacity o f the Government. A Procurement Policy Unit&#13;
(PPU) has n o w been established under MOF t o ensure the implementation through the creation o f&#13;
secondary legislation, standard bidding documents, provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary&#13;
information systems for advertising and data collection. "Rules o f Procedure for Public Procurement"&#13;
which details the better implementation o f the Procurement L a w has been issued by MOF as circular&#13;
number PPU/COO5/1386 dated April, 12 2007. The Procurement Appeal and Review mechanism i s in&#13;
place and the Manual o f Procedures for "Procurement Appeal and Review" has been issued by MOF as&#13;
circular number PPU/NOO1/1385 o n March 18, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
4.    In the absence o f adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some interim&#13;
arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement management o f the country. A central&#13;
procurement facilitation service, A R D S -PU has been established under the supervision o f Ministry o f&#13;
Economy. The Bank and the Government has agreed on a program for country wide procurement reform&#13;
and capacity building, leading t o the transition f i o m centralized to decentralized procurement services.&#13;
The Bank funded Public Administration Capacity Building project (PACBP) and Public Financial&#13;
Management Reform Project (PFMRP) are the primary instruments for implementing the program to&#13;
strengthen capacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement in an effective, transparent and&#13;
accountable manner. However, the implementation o f the procurement capacity building strategy has not&#13;
made any significant progress yet due to lack o f coordination and delays in decision making within the&#13;
Government. The envisaged radical changes t o the procurement management environment expected from&#13;
the new L a w also require the urgent implementation o f a comprehensive human resources and capacity&#13;
development program. The implementation o f the procurement reform component o f the PACBP and&#13;
PFMRP should be considered with due priority to ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced&#13;
and that capacity i s developed in the Government to maintain these standards.&#13;
&#13;
5.    A Consultant has n o w been mobilized under the PPU/MOF to carry out the capacity Building&#13;
which focuses o n systematic training o f staff o f ministries in public procurement. The assignment&#13;
includes conduct o f training programs to private sector. The consultant has completed the training needs&#13;
assessment and the program for training o f trainers has begun. The first training program i s planed t o&#13;
commence o n December 1,2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Assessment o f the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
&#13;
 15. The Ministry o f Education (MOE) and National S k i l l Development Program (NSDP) will have&#13;
overall responsibility for all procurement under the project. Both the implementing agencies will&#13;
implement procurement action under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
Ministry o f Education&#13;
&#13;
16. Procurement activities under the M O E components will be carried out through Grant Management&#13;
Unit, GMU.&#13;
&#13;
17. An assessment o f the capacity o f GMU, the ImplementingAgency to implement procurement&#13;
actions for the project, has been carried out by Rahimullah Wardak procurement Analyst in September&#13;
2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     66&#13;
&amp;#12;18. The GMU i s a group o f individuals established in 2005 to carry out procurement activities for&#13;
Education Quality Improvement Project (EQUJP-I), and other donors funded projects. The agency i s&#13;
staffed with 17 procurement staff. The procurement staff has limited experience in procurement under the&#13;
World Bank financed projects. The contracts for 17 procurement consultants are funded by the World&#13;
Bank and other donors. The procurement staff i s responsible for procurement o f works, goods, and&#13;
consultancy services. As the agency does not have competent procurement staff to cover the procurement&#13;
actions under Afghanistan National S k i l l Development Project as well. Therefore, it i s agreed that the two&#13;
International Procurement Specialists to be hired under EQUIP-I1 will provide cross support to both the&#13;
projects [ASDP and EQUIP-IT].&#13;
&#13;
19. The International Procurement Specialists along with other procurement officers under the GMU&#13;
will be responsible for managing procurement based on technical specifications/TOR provided by the&#13;
technical team o f the Ministry o f Education.&#13;
&#13;
National S k i l l Development Program&#13;
&#13;
20. Procurement activities under the NSDP components will be carried out by the NSDP PIU.&#13;
An assessment o f the capacity o f the procurement staff o f the implementing agency to implement part o f&#13;
the procurement actions for the project has been carried out by Rahimullah Wardak, Procurement Analyst&#13;
in September 2007. During the assessment it was revealed that the NSDP procurement staff did not have&#13;
experience in procurement under Bank financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
21.   To mitigate the risk, the following actions are needed:&#13;
&#13;
            The NSDP will be strengthened by a competent procurement specialist to carry out&#13;
            procurement action under the project and train the NSDP procurement staff.&#13;
            T o ensure compliance with the World Bank policy and procedure, procurement&#13;
            documentation for complex and large value o f goods, works and consultancy contracts shall&#13;
            be carried out with consultation o f the ARDS.&#13;
&#13;
22. The overall project risk for procurement with above arrangement i s medium with the recruitment o f&#13;
a competent procurement specialist and large value procurement being handled by ARDS-PU.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
23. The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which&#13;
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Borrower and the&#13;
Project Team on December 12,2007 and i s available at Ministry o f Education and the NSDP offices. I t&#13;
will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan&#13;
will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      67&#13;
&amp;#12;Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
24. In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity&#13;
assessment o f the implementing agencies have recommended one supervision mission to visit the field to&#13;
carry out post-review o f procurement actions. As the overall project risk for procurement i s high,&#13;
therefore, the percentage o f contracts to be post reviewed will be 10%.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Audit&#13;
&#13;
25. In addition to the prior review and post review supervisions to be carried out from Bank offices, an&#13;
independent procurement audit will also take place during the project life.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                    Annex 8: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
1.      As the project i s being processed under OP/BP 8.50 a f i l l economic analysis i s not required.&#13;
Secondly, Afghanistan i s yet to develop the kind o f statistical infrastructure and resources needed for such&#13;
an analysis. However, a brief analysis has been undertaken and i s included below.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The objectives o f the G O A under the Afghan Compact are to produce 150,000 skilled personnel&#13;
in the country by the Year 2010. This initial step i s aimed at providing the country with a corps o f trained&#13;
individuals who can better help implement projects and programs in the process o f rehabilitation and&#13;
development. This includes providing school leavers the opportunity to acquire market relevant s h l l s and&#13;
become more employable, while simultaneously providing focused employment oriented training for&#13;
those who have not had the benefit o f formal schooling and are seeking second chance opportunities. This&#13;
project aims to address critical skills issues in both the public and private sector, and cater to both formal&#13;
and informal sector employment. The government's aim i s to enhance the productivity o f its labor force&#13;
through such training and ensure that large numbers o f young Afghans are trained to be able to find&#13;
opportunities in the country and beyond.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Investment in human capital, especially o f the kind that i s currently taking place in Afghanistan,&#13;
will have an impact on a wide-variety o f social and economic outcomes. This will be a key measure in&#13;
helping individuals and families come out o f poverty and for laying the foundations for an inclusive&#13;
growth trend. I t i s widely recognized that a trained and educated workforce i s a necessary component o f&#13;
the process o f economic growth, though not necessarily a sufficient one.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Though not specifically related to training per se, there i s sufficient evidence from around the&#13;
world to suggest that in developing countries, those completing a higher level o f education are more&#13;
likely to find employment and have higher life-time incomes compared to individuals who do not.&#13;
Furthermore, in a country like Afghanistan, the direct and indirect spill-over effects o f education and&#13;
training for girls in terms o f delayed age o f first marriage, lower levels o f fertility and better child health,&#13;
are likely to be critical.&#13;
&#13;
5.       S h l l s development and improvement can also be a key strategy in Afghanistan to deal with the&#13;
problems o f high unemployment and poverty. Demand-driven and market relevant VET can enhance an&#13;
individual's likelihood o f being employed. Better job and higher income opportunities encouraged by&#13;
training, could improve the quality o f life o f the population. It i s expected better trained persons will be&#13;
more able to make use o f economic and social opportunities available to them, better adapt to newer&#13;
technologies, and modem processes. As has been stated above, a formal analysis o f the returns to training&#13;
(and education) would be difficult given the paucity o f relevant data in the country (for example, little&#13;
information on population estimates and trajectories, on schooling attainment, prior training, and wages o f&#13;
trained graduates).&#13;
&#13;
                                          Afghanistan's Labor Market&#13;
&#13;
6.      The only previous population census in Afghanistan was a partial, incomplete one population&#13;
census conducted in 1979. Consequently, there currently exists a very limited and inadequate population&#13;
database on which to formulate development policies and programs. The size and distribution o f the&#13;
population i s not known and this shortage o f information hampers national planning and policy&#13;
               n&#13;
formulation. I 2003, the I R C carried out a market survey25between March and April. The survey&#13;
demonstrates a high degree o f correlation between education levels, sector o f employment, and incomes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25 These numbers are based o n an IRC survey f r o m 2003 and i t s methodology has come under question recently.&#13;
Furthermore, the 40% o f businesses needing skilled personnel i s in sharp contrast t o the Bank's ICA that places the&#13;
lack o f skilled personnel very low o n the priority list o f employers and business owners.&#13;
                                                          80&#13;
&amp;#12;in localized markets. However, the survey design i s methodologically weak and some survey estimates&#13;
have come under considerable scrutiny. However, these estimated have almost become home-truths in&#13;
Afghanistan (even among development partners), who frequently cite large levels o f unemployment in the&#13;
country. There i s also a belief that about 40% o f businesses suggest that there i s a critical need for skilled&#13;
personnel, in sharp contrast to the Bank's ICA that places the lack o f skilled personnel as being very l o w&#13;
o n the priority list o f employers and business owners (World Bank 2007).&#13;
&#13;
7.        There i s considerable empirical evidence from around the world that completing basic and post-&#13;
basic education provides for higher returns in developing countries than in developed countries. Such rate&#13;
o f return calculations form the basis for decision making o n whether to invest in education. One of the&#13;
weaknesses with the typical ROR type calculations i s that they are typically applied to those in the waged&#13;
or salaried economy. In most developing countries, and particularly in a country like Afghanistan, where&#13;
over 90 % o f activity i s in the informal sector, there does seem to be a limited value for such elaborate&#13;
economic analysis. As stated earlier, in the Afghanistan context, this i s further compounded by the lack&#13;
o f reliable data o n indicators, such as, salariedwages by levels o f education and training, unit investment&#13;
and recurrent costs in education, and the probability o f being gainfully employed in the stream o n which&#13;
in which training was obtained.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The benefits o f the projects are assumed to accrue in three ways: (a) increased number of&#13;
graduates being put through the system, (b) children access training programs that are o f a higher quality,&#13;
and (c) improved internal efficiencies with lower dropout rates, absence rates, etc. Even the direct&#13;
calculation o f costs and benefits i s most likely to be a lower bound, since the indirect or spillover benefits&#13;
through better health, adaptability to changing environment, trainability are all concepts that are difficult&#13;
to measure but demonstrates these qualities.&#13;
&#13;
9.       However, given the post-conflict nature o f the country, it i s n o surprise that the rate o f return t o&#13;
education and training in Afghanistan i s very high. The NRVA 2005 indicates that there exists a positive&#13;
relation between education level and annual income. I t also shows that the wage and salary workers earn&#13;
between 24% and 174% times at each level o f school as much as those in self-employment (Table 1 and&#13;
Figure 1).&#13;

11.      Figure 8.2 is, indeed, the predication o f wages for different educational levels and skills, by type&#13;
o f employment. It i s clear that given education, experience and sector o f employment the income level o f&#13;
a salaried worker i s greater than the income level o f a non-salariedwage one. I t i s anticipated that with&#13;
the specific focus sectors o f training identified under this project, viz., management and administration,&#13;
accounting and financial management, ICT, basic engineering, and agriculture, and the level at which the&#13;
training i s being conceived (post-grade 12), there will be a shift towards wage employment for most&#13;
trainees emerging from two-year, post-grade 12 institutions under the MOE's DTVET. This would&#13;
considerably improve their chances for salary/wage employment and hence lead t o predicted higher&#13;
income levels. For people seeking second chance opportunities, and who are trained through the NSDP&#13;
facilitated training programs, it i s anticipated that the training would increase their opportunities for wage&#13;
employment or bring them to a higher income bracket within the self-employed categories.&#13;

Environmental And Social Safeguards Framework&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
 1.     W i t h an estimated population o f around 25 million, Afghanistan i s among the poorest countries in&#13;
the world. Afghanistan needs a well-trained and flexible workforce to help rebuild the country after three&#13;
decades o f conflict. The conflict has decimated Afghanistan's training infrastructure, t o m the fabric o f&#13;
human society, and has relegated the country to the status o f one o f the least developed in the world. The&#13;
country's efforts to emerge from this predicament i s hampered by numerous factors, one o f which i s the&#13;
availability o f a well-educated and trained labor force, that i s competent and flexible, thereby allowing the&#13;
acquisition o f new skills and trades needed by the country as i t grows and develops. A well-trained labor&#13;
force will yield higher productivity and be able to accommodate the changing needs o f a changing&#13;
economy, while simultaneously ensuring higher earnings and greater mobility for participants in the labor&#13;
force. Though a majority o f the Afghan labor-force i s in the informal sector, skills acquisition and&#13;
judiciously combined with literacy and numeracy programs, will result in a productive work force,&#13;
adaptation o f modern production technologies and enhance opportunities through self-employment and&#13;
small enterprise development.&#13;
&#13;
2.    The Afghanistan S k i l l Development Program in response to the above needs has different&#13;
components including the renovation and building the infrastructures for the s k i l l development program.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
3.      The proposed project development objective is:&#13;
&#13;
Increased number o f immediately-employable graduates i s produced by building, in stages, a high quality&#13;
TVET system that i s equitable, market responsive, and cost-effective.&#13;
&#13;
Potential Impacts o f Various Components&#13;
&#13;
4.       Activities under the project should not entail significant and negative environmental and social&#13;
impacts, provided they are designed and implemented with due consideration o f environmental and social&#13;
issues. Construction activities may cause limited, temporary, and localized negative impacts due to&#13;
&#13;
                                                      83&#13;
&amp;#12;depletion or degradation o f natural resources such as stone, earth, water etc. used for school construction&#13;
if proper environmental management i s not carried out at design, construction and operation stages. This&#13;
can be mitigated through the implementation o f an appropriate social and environmental management&#13;
plan. Capacity building o f PEDS and DEDs including physical and institutional management, are likely to&#13;
have a positive impact on social and physical environment.&#13;
&#13;
5.        In case, the project i s considering rehabilitation/ or construction o f new buildings o f vocational&#13;
institutions having components and installations o f old or new plants involved with, chemicals, chemical&#13;
fertilizer, and other similar polluting industries would need a special and full EIA by a competent relevant&#13;
specialist or a team as the case may be.&#13;
&#13;
6.      O P B P 4.0 1 i s triggered because o f vocational institutions building or rehabilitation activities.&#13;
The project will apply the principal Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) for&#13;
emergency projects in Afghanistan. T o limit the extent o f these risks, the Framework provides guidelines&#13;
and codes o f practice for an environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated in the design,&#13;
contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects, along with an implementation structure assigning&#13;
responsibilities to implementing agencies and their consultants, and a capacity building program for social&#13;
and environmental management.&#13;
&#13;
7.      There will be n o land acquisition under the project as all the physical works relate to&#13;
renovatiodrehabilitation o f buildings belonging to existing training institutions or few new constructions&#13;
within these institutions, which are all located on Ministry o f Education land. All the training institutions&#13;
are currently functioning, and there are thus no questions o f squatters or informal settlers on these lands.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Chance finds o f cultural property (archaeological artifacts) during implementation o f sub-projects&#13;
involving c i v i l works will be handled according to provisions in the "Law on Preservation&#13;
o f Afghanistan's Historical and Cultural Heritage (2004)" and be reported to the provincial or district&#13;
governors, who then will inform the Archaeological Committee.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Compliance with the safeguard provisions and the negative l i s t will be ensured through an&#13;
environmental, social and risk screening procedure (check lists) required for sub-project proposals, and by&#13;
internal input, process, and output monitoring, and by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
Purpose o f the Environmental and Social Management Framework&#13;
&#13;
10.      Currently, social and environmental management in Afghanistan i s suffering from critical&#13;
capacity constraints. Since there i s potential for adverse environmental impacts, albeit limited, from the&#13;
proposed activities under the ASDP, their mitigation and management i s key to the wholesome&#13;
rehabilitation and development within the vocational educational sector. Hence, keeping in view the&#13;
existing management capacity, as well as the flexibility requiredwith investments s t i l l to be finalized, a&#13;
framework approach i s adopted for ASDP. I t allows for early identification o f potential adverse impacts,&#13;
without the requirement o f rigorous analysis through quantification, and also provides general policies&#13;
and broad guidance for their effective mitigation, along with codes o f practice and procedures to be&#13;
integrated into project implementation. Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective o f the&#13;
Framework i s to help ensure that activities under the proposed reconstruction operations will:&#13;
&#13;
0       Protect human health;&#13;
0       Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
0       Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their cumulative&#13;
        effects;&#13;
0       Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and&#13;
0       Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      84&#13;
&amp;#12;General Principles&#13;
&#13;
11.      Recognizing the emergency nature o f the proposed relief and reconstruction operations, and the&#13;
related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in&#13;
managing potential environmental and social risks, this Framework i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
     a. The project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs o f which may not be known at&#13;
        appraisal. To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard policies, the&#13;
        Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the&#13;
        selection and design o f subprojects, and the planning o f mitigation measures;&#13;
&#13;
     b. All proposed subprojects will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks can be&#13;
        adequately addressed through the application o f standardized guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
     c. Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity between&#13;
        ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density. Employment&#13;
        opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis o f&#13;
        professional competence, irrespective o f gender, or ethnic or religious group. A separate gender&#13;
        assessment has been conducted to help accomplish the project's development objective" to&#13;
        expand access to jobs and skills training, as well as meet i t s commitment to gender&#13;
        mainstreaming through a gender-focused assessment.&#13;
&#13;
     d. Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs o f these&#13;
        operations. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
        Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the World&#13;
         Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
12.     The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects will be consistent&#13;
with the following guidelines, codes o f practice and requirements:&#13;
&#13;
     a. A negative l i s t o f characteristics that would make a proposed subproject ineligible for support, as&#13;
        indicated in Attachment 1;&#13;
     b. Procedures for the chance discovery o f archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and&#13;
        burial sites, provided in Attachment 2;&#13;
     c. Relevant elements o f the codes o f practice for the mitigation o f potential environmental impacts,&#13;
        presented in Attachment 3;&#13;
     d. Relevant Environmental Guidelines for Contractors to be used during the construction o f the&#13;
        facilities (see Guidelines in Attachment 4)&#13;
&#13;
Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
13.     The overall responsibility o f project implementation rests with the Ministry o f Education (MOE)&#13;
and the Ministry o f Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). A designated Safeguards&#13;
Nodal Officer will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation o f the Environment&#13;
and Social Safeguards Framework and Management Plan within the Project Management Team at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2'Increased number o f immediately-employable graduates is produced by building, in stages, a high quality TVET&#13;
system that i s equitable, market responsive, and cost-effective.&#13;
                                                       85&#13;
&amp;#12;relevant ministries. T h i s could be a sanitation engineer currently having responsibility in the ministries&#13;
and n o need to hire a specific person for this.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Building and Monitoring of Safeguard FrameworkImplementation&#13;
&#13;
14.      The capacity building activity will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance&#13;
program for Social and Environmental management. As part o f the social and environmental capacity&#13;
building that will be provided for implementation o f IDA-financed operations in Afghanistan, the&#13;
Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff o f MOE and implementing agencies/Consultants will receive&#13;
training in the application o f the Safeguard Framework. Specialist training modules may be considered&#13;
after an acceptable level o f base knowledge has been established. During supervision o f the project, the&#13;
World Bank will assess the implementation o f the Framework, and if required, will recommend additional&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
15.      This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed on the basis o f an overall&#13;
Framework for World Bank-funded reconstruction operations which was prepared in consultation with&#13;
the principal NGOs, and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in Afghanistan.&#13;
Prior to approval o f the project by the World Bank, it will be disclosed by the Government in Dari and&#13;
Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. Since no&#13;
other separate environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under the proposed&#13;
reconstruction operations, no additional disclosure requirements will apply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                Attachment 2&#13;
&#13;
                                     Protection of Cultural Property&#13;
&#13;
1.     Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropologxal point o f view, including&#13;
unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural property i s defined as&#13;
sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, or religious&#13;
significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The proposed emergency project i s unlikely t o pose a risk o f damaging cultural property, as the&#13;
sub-projects will largely consist o f small investments in community infrastructure and income generating&#13;
activities, reconstruction o f existing structures, and minor urban public works. Further, the negative l i s t&#13;
o f attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for support (Attachment l),    includes any activity&#13;
that would significantly damage non-replicable cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures&#13;
for identification, protection from theft, and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and included in&#13;
standard bid documents.&#13;
&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
&#13;
3.    Chance find procedures are defined in the l a w o n the Preservation o f Afghanistan's Historical and&#13;
Cultural Heritages (decree no. 19, Official Gazette, no. 828, 1383/02/31 - 2004/05/20)), specifying the&#13;
authorities and responsibilities o f cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the&#13;
course o f project implementation. T h i s l a w establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and&#13;
cultural artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
    i.    All humanitarian artifacts (Moveable and Immoveable) which have historical, scientific, artistic&#13;
          or cultural value and are at least one hundred (100) years old.(art. 3, 1)&#13;
&#13;
    ii. All artifacts which are less than 100 years old but have cultural, scientific and artistic value and&#13;
          are determined to be preserve able and valuable artifacts (art. 3,2).&#13;
&#13;
     i.&#13;
    i i The Archaeology Institute and the Historical Artifacts Preservation and Repair Department are&#13;
          both responsible to survey, evaluate, determine and record all cultural and historical sites and&#13;
          collect and organize all historical documents related t o each specific site. N o one can build or&#13;
          perform construction on the recorded historical and cultural site unless approved or granted&#13;
          permission or agreement i s issued from the Archaeology Institute (art. 7)&#13;
&#13;
    iv.   Whenever municipalities, construction, irrigation or other companies (whether they are&#13;
          governmental or private) find or discover valuable historical and cultural artifacts during the&#13;
          conduct o f their projects, they are responsible to stop their project and report any findings t o the&#13;
          Archaeology Institute about the discovery. (art. 10). If a construction project harms a historical&#13;
          or cultural artifact, the project will be stopped until proper measures are taken t o preclude such&#13;
          harm. (art. 11)&#13;
&#13;
    v.    Any finder or discoverer o f historical and cultural sites i s obligated to report a find or discovery&#13;
          to the Archeology Institute immediately but not later than one week if it i s in the city and not&#13;
          later than 2 weeks if it i s in a province. All discovered artifacts are considered public properties&#13;
          and the Government o f Afghanistan will pay for all lands and sites which are considered to be&#13;
          o f historical or cultural value.(&amp;. 19, 1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      88&#13;
&amp;#12;    v1.    Whenever there i s an immovable historical and cultural site discovered which includes some&#13;
           movable historical and cultural artifacts, all such movable artifacts are considered public&#13;
           property and the owner o f that property will be rewarded according to Article 13 o f this Decree&#13;
           (art. 19,2).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Gender Assessment&#13;
&#13;
1.         Over the past three decades o f conflict, Afghan men and women have encountered pronounced&#13;
obstacles in their access to education and development o f s k i l l s for employment. Minimal involvement in&#13;
public l i f e has left a generation o f women with l o w literacy rates (estimated recently at 18 percent for&#13;
women over age 18 and, in rural areas, as l o w as 10 percent2*) and limited skills for paid employment.&#13;
Women's participation in economic activities remains largely agricultural, family-based, and not&#13;
monetarily compensated. I certain areas, cultural traditions restrict women's work to that which i s&#13;
                                 n&#13;
performed in the household. Afghan males face their own set o f barriers in the current armed conflict&#13;
situation, which promotes a violent atmosphere and i s not conducive to raising awareness about&#13;
vocational s k i l l s training opportunities. Training programs must compete with higher-paying activities,&#13;
including the illegal opium industry, that have a greater short-term appeal to males than the longer-term&#13;
payoff o f investment in s k i l l s and educational attainment. Barriers for both males and females deprive&#13;
Afghanistan o f a substantial contribution to i t s stock o f human capital, a critical factor in i t s rapid&#13;
reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
Review o f Gender Focus in the Four Components o f Project Design&#13;
&#13;
2.       The project has committed to gender mainstreaming through a gender-focused assessment prior to&#13;
                                                                             By&#13;
Project Appraisal that will inform further planning and implementati~n.'~ targeting females as well as&#13;
males in i t s objectives, ASDP reflects the gender sensitive approaches (reviewed below) o f related&#13;
programming in M o E and the NSDP in MOLSAMD, under whose aegis the project will operate.30&#13;
Components 2 and 3 support NSDP and M o E programs for TVET and literacy training. B o t h program&#13;
strategies give attention to gender mainstreaming in several project and sub-project activities and have&#13;
identified gender-related targets among priority results. Components 1 and 4 address gender to a lesser&#13;
degree and draw from NSDP's Strategy, as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
3.                                                                                          n&#13;
        Component 1: Develop Rermlatorv and Oualitv Assurance Framework for TVET. I developing&#13;
an appropriate regulatory, legislative and institutional framework and strengthening capacity to plan,&#13;
monitor and coordinate the framework, NSDP aims to develop a national VET delivery policy with&#13;
gender-sensitive attention to skills shortages in all sectors.&#13;
&#13;
4.          Component 2: Improve Relevance, Oualitv and Efficiency o f TVET aims to increase the access to&#13;
post-basic education and training programs that are relevant to the needs o f the market, o f high quality,&#13;
and improve employment opportunities for both women and men.31T h i s component addresses&#13;
improvements among select trades and VE institutions under MOE, which has made TVET a major part&#13;
o f i t s National Strategic Plan. I t s TVET program i s fundamentally gender sensitive in i t s approaches and&#13;
objectives, with an overall goal to "provide relevant and quality technical and vocational opportunities for&#13;
all male and female Afghans in order to equip them with marketable s k i l l s that meet the needs o f the&#13;
                                                            ~~&#13;
labour market in Afghanistan and other c o u n t r i e ~ . "Like NSDP, MoE's programming emphasizes a&#13;
shift from supply-driven technical and trades training to labor market demand-driven TVET opportunities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Afghanistan `s Millennium Development Goals Report, 2005: Vision 2020; (Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan Ministry o f&#13;
Education (MoE). 2006. "The National Strategic Plan for Education in Afghanistan" [December 2006 Draft], p. 49.&#13;
29 This commitment i s expressed in the ASDP, Project Information Document, p. 3.&#13;
30 ASDP has adopted MoE's vision to provide ". . .equal access to a better quality education for all, regardless o f gender,&#13;
ethnicity, language, religion or geographical location, and build the country's human resources to meet the challenges of national&#13;
reconstruction and launch the country on a path of rapid growth and development (MoE 2006: p. 4). I t also reflects NSDP's&#13;
"strong commitment to addressing women's access to vocational education and training and gender issues will be addressed in all&#13;
aspects o f the program" (NSDP, Strategy Master Document [May 31,2007 draft], p. 13.&#13;
3' These opportunities are gained "through the provision of market-driven skills training, business training and linkages to&#13;
business development support services" (NSDP 2007, p. 4).&#13;
32 MoE. 2006, p. 13.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                93&#13;
&amp;#12;(plus management skills training) for both men and women. For the target period (2006-2010), this will&#13;
be accomplished through expanding existing TVET apparatus, closer partnership with the private sector,&#13;
and short-term training courses in select TV fields that target both male and female unemployed youth.&#13;
The Literacy and Non-formal Education program o f M o E builds upon N S D P and M O L S M D ' s planned&#13;
Vocational Training Centres. This program i s especially attentive to females, as MOE cites poor female&#13;
attendance in an already l o w overall participation rate (10 percent among only 15,000 students in 2006).&#13;
One goal i s that by end 2007, females comprise at least 60 percent o f the target 100,000 learners from a l l&#13;
provinces. Principal planning objectives for 2010 include a minimum 50 percent improvement in literacy&#13;
rates and a minimum 60 percent o f learners are female. Another objective i s that at least 30-35 percent o f&#13;
the 12,000 youth and civil servants trained in finance and public administration s k i l l s are female (2008-&#13;
2010). T w o o f five priority program components also address gender issues: curriculum development&#13;
will adhere to the principle o f easy access to education for females and males; and short-term (6-12&#13;
months) vocational courses for up to 4,000 youths and existing civil servants require a minimum 40&#13;
percent female participation. The cascade approach to training, where literacy facilitators mentor&#13;
facilitator assistants who then launch classes in their communities aims to "enable communities with few&#13;
literate people, females in particular, to develop their own team o f literacy facilitators after the first&#13;
classes have been conducted.. .."33&#13;
&#13;
5.       Component 3: Skills Development Program and Market Linkages with a Rural Focus This&#13;
component will provide rural-markets oriented training for youth, destitute women, and marginal farmers&#13;
aimed at diversifying their income sources, improving productivity, and developing marker linkages in&#13;
rural areas without any pre-condition o f prescribed schooling levels. The component will be implemented&#13;
by the NSDP o f M O L S A M D with the following priority results expected by 2010: at least 35 percent o f&#13;
the 150,000 unemployed or underemployed Afghans who gain opportunities are women; and improved&#13;
capacity o f GOA and VET providers to promote gender equality in relevant, high-quality, labor market-&#13;
driven training.&#13;
&#13;
6.        NSDP plans to gender sensitize VET practitioners and c i v i l servants: a l l staff and managers in&#13;
relevant PIUs and other training institutions will receive gender awareness training, and at least 30&#13;
percent o f stafvmanagers in the NSDP PIU are to be women. NSDP ensures gender sensitivity in&#13;
training, framework development, and labor market analysis; and attention to the security situation so&#13;
related constraints do not impede female participation. NSDP's two-pronged strategy o f gender&#13;
mainstreaming and gender-specific action (carried out in partnership with the Ministry o f Women's&#13;
Affairs) emphasizes gender equality in teaching methodology and training/skills development curricula;&#13;
encourages female participation in non-traditional occupations; and commits t o set up&#13;
facilitiedmechanisms for female trainee management o f childcare, provide school-level career&#13;
guidancehounseling; build training provider capacity to address gender issues, carry out targeted&#13;
campaigns for training/promotion o f female employment, and provide second-chance educatiodliteracy&#13;
training to both men and women.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Component 4: Research, Monitoring and Evaluation. NSDP, MoE will develop info/M&amp;E&#13;
systems to provide routine, timely information on implementation and more accurate, up-to-date gender-&#13;
disaggregated labor market data that translates into policies for men's and women's s h l l s development.&#13;
MoE's TVET, Literacy/Non-formal Ed programs already collect gender-disaggregated data on literacy,&#13;
training rates and student, teacher participation in TV Schools.&#13;

            The project development objective (PDO)
            of the Skills Development Project of Afghanistan is to
            increase the number of immediately-employable graduates by
            building, in stages, a high quality Technical Vocation and
            Education Training (TVET) system that is equitable, market
            responsive, and cost-effective. This above project
            development objective is to be operationalized through the
            project components described below: Component 1: Develop
            Regulatory and Quality Assurance Framework for TVET which
            will create the necessary institutional conditions for a
            quality TVET system that is demand driven and oriented
            towards labor market needs; Component 2: Improve Relevance,
            Quality and Efficiency of TVET which will improve the
            relevance, quality and efficiency of TVET  programs, and to
            increase the number of graduates from these programs,
            through the establishment of a new institute, and by
            undertaking rehabilitation and reforms of a select number of
            other institutions. Initially, training programs will be
            contracted out to experienced, national and international
            training institutions through partnership arrangements;
            Component 3: Skills Development Program and Market Linkages
            with a Rural Focus which aims to support a slice of the
            on-going activities by the National Skills Development
            Program, and build the capacity within National Skill
            Development Program (NSDP) and Ministry of Labor, Social
            Affairs and Martyred and Disabled (MOLSAMD) to undertake
            reforms in technical and vocational training, labor market
            assessments, and to strengthen industrial and market
            linkages; and Component 4: Research, Monitoring &amp;
            Evaluation which will provide routine, timely, and accurate
            information on program implementation and allow for the
            measurement o f longer term impacts and independent research.
