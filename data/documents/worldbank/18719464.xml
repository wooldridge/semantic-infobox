&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors ofthe&#13;
World Bank's fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
overview ofthe work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
WEBB: .. LAC [Latin America and Caribbean Region] in the '60s?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I was initially. I was an economist and then afterwards division chief.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You didn't go to Peru. I was in the central bank then.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: At that time?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: At that time.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: But later you were president of the central bank also?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Later. I was dealing with the--Hans Wyss was ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: The division chief.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The division chief. That's right.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: That's where I was until [inaudible] That was late '60s.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And [Roger A.] Chaufoumier was ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Chaufoumier was deputy director just when I came into LAC, but he&#13;
moved very soon after that [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You have a very special experience in terms of regions, a cross-sectional&#13;
view of how the Bank has been operating on the ground in these different regions, and&#13;
I thought that would be an interesting area to talk about because we have a lot of-for&#13;
us it's hard to get an overview of that kind: questions like how conditionality is being&#13;
evolved over time, cross-country analysis, the kinds of differences one can talk about.&#13;
I mean, there's the obvious evolution from projects to the sectors to broader macro&#13;
analysis. When you were in East Asia, for instance, up 'til 1980, you were there in .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I was there 'til '83.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But up 'til1980, '81 or even up 'til '83, did you have much experience with&#13;
adjustment? Was macro conditionality something that you really worked with even&#13;
though it wasn't in a more formal form of adjustment loans? Was it a big part of the&#13;
economic analysis, the dialogue, an implicit conditionality?&#13;

                                   S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                    July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, let's make a distinction between economic analysis and dialogue and&#13;
conditionality. It means that a lot of Bank analysis has been on macroeconomics,&#13;
even before we got so deep into adjustment issues. But my view is that the&#13;
understanding ofthe full dimensions of macroeconomic problems has evolved with&#13;
time. And a typical macroeconomic analysis would have been about balance of&#13;
payments, external debts, capital flows; a certain amount was domestic [inaudible}&#13;
balances. When we went into structural issues involving the {inaudible} we did some&#13;
work about the structural aspects of trade, commodity concentration, the profile of&#13;
debt and so on. And I did in fact one of the first adjustment loans for the Bank on&#13;
Philippines and then Korea and a third was on Thailand. The only ones that had been&#13;
done before that, I think, were Turkey and possibly Kenya. And the answer to your&#13;
question is that, you know, the focus on macroeconomic issues was not there, and&#13;
there was perhaps agreement on conditionality, but largely solutions focusing on&#13;
issues oftrade, industry, industrial [inaudible} policy and so on.&#13;
&#13;
But my view is that the understanding of we economists ofthe macroeconomic issues&#13;
was not very clear, not just in the Bank but everywhere. It means that we operated&#13;
two separate planes: the macroeconomic plane and then we shifted a bit to the sectoral&#13;
plane for the powers that I already mentioned and so on, but we never thought of&#13;
macroeconomic issues as the sum totals of the operation of governments, and&#13;
therefore we never focused on what were the constituent elements of the&#13;
macroeconomic issues.&#13;
&#13;
I'll give you an example. When we talk about government deficits or government&#13;
surpluses or things like that, we did not carry our analysis to, for example, public&#13;
enterprises, public impact on the operation of public enterprises on development. We&#13;
didn't go deep enough into the whole issue of transfers and subsidies and what did it&#13;
do to the management of the public sector and the government. We did it in some&#13;
places like Egypt for a time, but not generally. We seldom looked at the whole issue&#13;
of the sources of goods, which has been a very important issue [inaudible] in some&#13;
countries, for example in Israel. Management: in Argentina, for example, up 'til&#13;
1988 we never did a full, had a full understanding of the operation of the government&#13;
financial institutions and [inaudible} accounts.&#13;
&#13;
So this wisdom has come with time and has come slowly, that macroeconomics does&#13;
not float in air but macroeconomics has as its base very deep institutional and sectoral&#13;
questions and therefore you cannot do institution to any viable [inaudible]. So the&#13;
answer to your question is that even in the structural adjustment process the link&#13;
between macroeconomics and sectoral issues has been very explicit and probably has&#13;
emerged much more in the last two to four years than emerged on such [inaudible}&#13;
'80s. Emerged on Mexico. For example, and take the [inaudible] We had&#13;
[inaudible] early in the '80s, public sector early in the '80s [inaudible] until we got&#13;
deeper, much deeper, into the sectoral issues and therefore deeper into the link&#13;
between sectoral issues [inaudible} and macroeconomic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's very interesting. I hadn't-! hadn't visualized that at all: the Bank, as&#13;
it were, going up to the top, going back down into the structural issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: But what had been happening is that we were concerned with structural&#13;
issues. But let's say we were concerned with a pillar here and a pillar there and a&#13;
pillar there. And we focused on the pillar, which means we focused on, for example,&#13;
the functioning of the power company and what did it do to the finances of the power&#13;
company. We focused on agriculture sector and agriculture prices and technology&#13;
and so on, but basically what did it do to the agricultural production. But we seldom&#13;
focused on these as organic issues which ultimately had a phenomenon impact on the&#13;
functioning of governments and therefore the functioning of the economy. We never&#13;
focused on the silent preference, which has become a huge issue, actually. We never&#13;
focused on vested rights and vested interests. We never focused on what the&#13;
accumulation of these things did to the functioning of governments. And I think we&#13;
are doing a lot of that today, and we are learning, consequently, that it is precisely&#13;
because of this that the resumption of macroeconomic management is so difficult, and&#13;
I think [inaudible} If you look at the sequential plans like the Astral [phonetic} plan&#13;
and the Chimauela [phonetic} plan and the Verano [phonetic} plan and this plan and&#13;
that plan and all the failed plans, then you realize that both the government and we&#13;
had an inadequate understanding of what made for the deficits.&#13;
&#13;
Take Argentina. It was not until two years ago that the Bank started focusing on the&#13;
administration of the debt, structural analysis, and the Fund did not start doing that&#13;
until then, either. And yet you realize that in a country where there are only thirty&#13;
thousand taxpayers, how you can talk of fiscal balances unless you start focusing on&#13;
the whole administration of the debt ceiling? We did not start focusing on the whole&#13;
impact ofthe public enterprises on government operations in Argentina until about&#13;
three years ago. We did not start focusing on the impact on Argentina of the social&#13;
security systems and similar things until about a year. So wisdom is slow to come. It&#13;
has come likely because of the experience of failed assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is this learning occurring mostly in the regions? Is PRE [Policy, Research&#13;
and External Affairs} very involved?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, I don't think that it's only in the regions. Clearly our involvement is&#13;
much deeper [inaudible} enhanced understanding of the Bank of the fact that when&#13;
you just talk of macroeconomic aggregates, all that you are looking at is the tip of the&#13;
iceberg [inaudible] You are not going to understand the whole issue.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I guess I have an idea (rather than proof)--you had the pre-debt crisis world&#13;
and the post-debt crisis, and the way the Bank has to deal with the countries obviously&#13;
had to change, and it was mostly conditioned by that. And if that were true, then the&#13;
Bank's dealings today with a country like Colombia ought to look very much like the&#13;
way it dealt with--1 don't know-Indonesia in the '70s.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Let's say that the pre-debt crisis Bank was totally preoccupied with&#13;
making loans. I mean, you had sort of two or three pockets of the Bank's concern.&#13;
One was making loans: the conviction of [RobertS.} McNamara and the conviction&#13;
of those who had worked with the gap models and so on that the key issue was capital&#13;
transfer to developing countries, that in relation to their economic potential&#13;
developing countries were not over-borrowed and that the return to capital was very&#13;
high [inaudible] problem, so a tremendous emphasis. And that's the time when&#13;
basically the Bank made the transition from a lending institution to a capital transfer&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
institution, where you did not just ask whether there were projects [inaudible] that&#13;
you were supporting, but you basically had an objective to transfer a certain amount&#13;
of capital to the countries.&#13;
&#13;
The other part of that ethos was the tremendous intellectual ferment between&#13;
McNamara and [Hollis} Chenery and others, focused on issues like poverty, rural&#13;
development, urban development, energy and so on. But what used to happen is that&#13;
particular issues assumed life of their own. Take the last one, the energy issue. I&#13;
recollect that McNamara sort of looked at--after the second oil price shock occurred&#13;
in 1978 or something--McNamara would look at what it did to the gap ofthe&#13;
developing countries, and he'd say, "Oh, my God. The gap of developing countries is&#13;
63 billion dollars. How are they going to manage?" So he was totally preoccupied&#13;
with this and tears would come into his eyes. Then the Bank was predicting that the&#13;
petroleum price would keep increasing sort of exponentially in almost a straight line,&#13;
so total preoccupation with the fact that--what it would do to the Bank and to the&#13;
developing countries. What it did to the Bank was that the Bank got totally blinded to&#13;
the liability consequences of the flow of capital. It means that we got so preoccupied&#13;
with the current gap that we did not stop to ask what would it do to total&#13;
independence. We did not ask about risk, that with this the entire risk unsettled the&#13;
burden of deficit of the developing countries. We didn't ask this sufficiently,&#13;
sufficiently, in what [inaudible] in mind was just by forming was going to be there,&#13;
for example, on a country like Pakistan. This was one issue.&#13;
&#13;
Then we were so enamored by the energy issue that we started financing, pushing&#13;
energy projects like [inaudible} Central. I'll give you an example. You go to&#13;
Colombia today, and you will find a large number of huge power projects, dams being&#13;
under construction, have been under construction for eight, nine, ten years, financed&#13;
by the World Bank, IDB [Inter-American Development Bank} and so on. Their&#13;
completion would lead to substantial excess capacity in generation in Colombia. In&#13;
the meantime these projects have been going on, progress; in many cases institutions&#13;
have asked Columbia to complete their inadequate finances. So you have sort of&#13;
these works moving on and yet the debt service of these countries [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
In Honduras we financed a huge electric power project, a hydro project called El&#13;
Cajon. Again, only thirty percent of its capacity is being used--we ascribe to market&#13;
debt service. And on the assumption that the electric power profits are so to be had,&#13;
well, precisely then these sort of projects are coming in.&#13;
&#13;
But in Brazil we financed and promoted a power [inaudible] project, a substitute for&#13;
petroleum, and the subsidy on power consumption [inaudible] two billion dollars per&#13;
year, an important element in the debt adjustment. An entire automobile industry has&#13;
been converted to the use of power [inaudible} It means that we can ration the&#13;
gasoline with [inaudible] much better cost to the economy. So these are some of the&#13;
consequences ofthe tunnel vision that we've brought to the debt crisis [inaudible]&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you can say that the Bank has lost all these intellectual leaders [inaudible]&#13;
years. But probably it is less evangelical, and probably there is greater room for&#13;
review of the broader dimensions of issues than there were. So what the confirmation&#13;
[inaudible] played is from an evangelical Bank to probably a more deliberative Bank,&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
although the intellectual part of the Bank has decayed quite a bit and needs to&#13;
[inaudible} probably come across somewhat more introspective and less evangelical.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Could one generalize about how, the degree of power that the Bank has, has&#13;
evolved, the leverage?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I think the Bank has a lot of leverage and a lot of power, which is not&#13;
quite indicated simply by the amount of resource confidence in various markets, but&#13;
this leverage comes from three or four issues: first, by the quality of economic&#13;
research work that we do, in the sense that we are the only game in town in that&#13;
regard. There is nobody else who talks to the developing countries that brings to bear&#13;
on this dialogue the same overwhelming and frightening weight of intellectual power,&#13;
and that's very important. And today in Argentina there's no step that would take in&#13;
privatization, many other areas of economic policy, without a substantial input of the&#13;
World Bank. So one is the sheer intellectual power.&#13;
&#13;
Second is increasingly the intertwining nature of international financial institutions. It&#13;
means the Bank is tied to IMF [International Monetary Fund]; IMF is tied to Bank;&#13;
everybody is tied to the commercial banks; so the interdependence of the whole&#13;
system. Basically financial institutions have ganged up on developing countries;&#13;
that's what it is. And you have a sort of a monopoly on this point, at least on market&#13;
solutions. That again means that we're aware policies have a tremendous leverage on&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Even though at the same time it must cut two ways on the Bank, because&#13;
now the Bank can't just tum on and offthe tap by itself. It has to worry about what ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, it still does tum on and off quite a bit. Between 1988, early '89 and&#13;
late 1990, we did not [inaudible} project in Argentina even though-in Brazil, for&#13;
example, we have taken a negative reflow of amortizations to the tune of half a billion&#13;
dollars a year without acceding to pressures for fast disbursing loans. [inaudible} It's&#13;
a bit quieter, but it still happens.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I guess I was seeing that the Peruvian scene is so complicated now, so&#13;
awkward, so many political considerations come into that.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, basically in the case of Peru, as far as support [inaudible} is&#13;
concerned, there was no way to support you, for example, without Japan and the&#13;
United States. And everybody got a kind of pleasure when the U.S. basically, you&#13;
know, said that it is to finance [inaudible] on the drug issue [inaudible] because here&#13;
there was the issue of clear [inaudible} and that would not have happened without ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There's still no sign of a drug [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: But the U.S. is very much in assuming that [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, I get mixed reports on that.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: You do? What do you hear?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, Well, I was lunching with the number two at the Peruvian Embassy a&#13;
couple days ago. He's just-he had been talking to someone in the State Department&#13;
who is rather pessimistic, even though his own boss, the ambassador, was optimistic.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Why is that? Because they feel that the U.S. is asking for too much&#13;
[inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, my sense of it is that Peru hasn't really bit the bullet with respect to ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Has not bitten the bullet?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, with respect to interdiction, the use of sort of massiveÂ· military force,&#13;
with American advisors maybe even hidden in the trees but with some degree of&#13;
involvement--but even just by the Peruvian military. I think the Peruvian government&#13;
has continued to dream of a solution that would be more voluntary based on&#13;
substantial American assistance. And that's the picture they dream; that's the political&#13;
image of the settlement. And I don't see that working. I don't see the American&#13;
government sucked in there. I don't think it would work anyway. I think the only&#13;
way is force. So that's just my--I'm a complete outsider on this. I just had a few&#13;
casual conversations.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: But all I'm saying is ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But in general what you're saying ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: .. that the Bank is [inaudible} structure of macroeconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
But, you know, there are many Banks now. I think basically right now there are three&#13;
World Banks and maybe [inaudible] There's a World Bank in Latin America and&#13;
there's a World Bank in Africa and there's a World Bank in Asia.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: A lot of money between the three ofthem.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: And then the World Bank in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank in Africa is engaged very much in maintaining, in their very market&#13;
resource transfers, in convincing donors, probably engaged also in restructuring,&#13;
supported substantially through adjustment lending, but in a very long-haul question.&#13;
And clearly that Bank is very distant from the old Bank in Africa, which was very&#13;
narrowly project-oriented, where a lot of the projects that had been undertaken failed&#13;
because of the inadequate [inaudible] institution, very poor project concept and a&#13;
poor understanding of African conditions, management of projects in [inaudible]&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank in Latin America has had some spectacular success in Mexico, Chile,&#13;
Bolivia, in supporting economic adjustment there, and now substantially involved in&#13;
Argentina with similar results, trying now to effect the change to a supporting&#13;
economic growth society, to refocus on the issue of investment but not in the old style&#13;
but trying to bring some synergies into projects, sector and urban economic issues&#13;
while keeping in mind the country's structural problems.&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank in Europe is totally preoccupied with the changes in Europe, Eastern&#13;
Europe, and therefore coping with traumatic shifts from centrally planned economies&#13;
to a market economy [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
The Bank in Asia is closest to the Bank of the '70s than any of the other Banks. You&#13;
have project lending without any significant policy dialogue, except possibly in&#13;
Indonesia where you've always had a very, very strong policy dialogue, but definitely&#13;
not in India [inaudible}, not the same, really, as the Bank is functioning in the three&#13;
other areas.&#13;
&#13;
So in this continental economy, the question is whether the Bank can ever be what has&#13;
been virtually [inaudible} what is it possibly going to be for the next [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And how do you see the Inter-American Development Bank?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I don't know. They are trying to make a big policy statement, but I think&#13;
the policy statement is highly important to [inaudible] My view is that policy&#13;
prerogatives very [inaudible] and I think you have to approach it with humility,&#13;
because if we look at the record of the past and see how things have ended, the only&#13;
thing that comes through is how little we knew. And the biggest lesson of the past is&#13;
the lesson of humility because--look at the energy crisis. Look at the debt crisis.&#13;
Look at the crisis of governments. You can rationalize everything now, and now you&#13;
can see how crystal-clear it is.&#13;
&#13;
But to ask these international organizations to practice humility, proably if you advise&#13;
the developing countries about the [inaudible] So the lesson of the past is humility&#13;
and how little we know. Even this organization, with a large number ofPhDs and so&#13;
on, ifthat can be clear, then you cannot be too gung-ho on sort ofthe game of arm-&#13;
twisting. And that lesson the Inter-American Bank has to learn. And my view is that&#13;
the lOB has ..&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B)&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: .. the focus [inaudible} by the lOB is not [inaudible] And I happen to&#13;
agree that it has got to get back to its roots because it [inaudible} a big gap. That's&#13;
the prime need in Latin America today, and it should get into that. I don't know if&#13;
you read an article in Washington Post authored by Jerry [Jerome 1] Levinson, who&#13;
used to be general counsel.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, I did.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I thought that was a very good article.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Good points.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: A very, very good article. -&#13;

                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's a logical role for him, to continue.&#13;
&#13;
The sense that I, that one gets is that in the World Bank now a director, a vice&#13;
president, has to be much more of a diplomat and also a bit of a financial wheeler-&#13;
dealer, deal-maker.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, I wouldn't call it frankly a deal-maker, but it's the way that&#13;
management jobs--first of all, I think you cannot be an effective legal advisor to the&#13;
World Bank if you do not have an intellectual base. It means you have to have the&#13;
capacity to comprehend substantive issues on a very broad scale and be able to&#13;
assemble and lead a team basically to [inaudible] That's one issue. The second issue&#13;
is that he has got to be an excellent manager of resources and budgets and so on&#13;
because ultimately you function in a very constrained environment. And thirdly he&#13;
has got to be a very fine manager of [inaudible] If you are missing in one of these&#13;
three, then you better not be there.&#13;
&#13;
I think we do--l personally do very little of [inaudible} My view is that [inaudible]&#13;
should follow from the basic work that we do. We have not done the basic work in&#13;
[inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, the Fund is taking on more of the deal-making function now. Is that&#13;
perhaps right?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, I think Fund depends very much on the macroeconomic business, but&#13;
the Fund is a little more vocal now and attaches much greater importance to its&#13;
relationship with the Bank and therefore to be interdependent, which has led to the&#13;
economic [inaudible} issues. I think in Latin American countries today the Fund is&#13;
seen in a better light than it used to be, not because the Fund has changed that much&#13;
but the understanding ofthe issues [inaudible] I think that the failure of, failure of&#13;
structuralism, failure of social doctrines. People have tried everything, and they&#13;
failed. And basically the lesson that they learned from Chile and then from Peru that&#13;
ultimately there is no substitute to old-fashioned fiscal contracts. Everything else&#13;
comes later, but unless you have the fiscal issue in hand, you have no--there's no&#13;
[inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The Bank has been now recently on issues ofthe slightly slippery slope of&#13;
governance, primarily in the work in Africa. If you look back on your experience in&#13;
East Asia and the Philippines, I guess at that time [Ferdinand] Marcos was president,&#13;
how do you see this issue in the framework of those countries and the Bank's&#13;
involvement there?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, I think they used the right word, that the Bank is on a slippery slope&#13;
on governance, but I think we have got to be concerned about those aspects of&#13;
government which affect the economic management, which means the impact of&#13;
anything on the [inaudible] resource development [inaudible] on the efficiency of the&#13;
economy, on rent creation [inaudible] And I look back at Philippines, and I was vice&#13;
president [inaudible] we should have tried to comprehend much more the whole issue&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
of corruption and how it affected public resources, how it affected [inaudible]&#13;
resources, how it affected [inaudible] institutions, [inaudible] misunderstood&#13;
[inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Were you at all constrained by the interests [inaudible] chairman with&#13;
[inaudible]?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Inadequate understanding.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You know, I have an anecdote along the same lines. I was part of a World&#13;
Bank mission to Honduras in 1974. The head ofthe mission, a Canadian, Lome&#13;
Sonley, a very good man, the best kind of banker, technician, practical, and he had&#13;
worked in all the sectors. This was a complicated mission, and the Honduran&#13;
government is one of the most--a shambles. They can't get anything done. Nothing&#13;
seems to happen. He was very frustrated. One day he said, "I wish we were in&#13;
Nicaragua. When you need to do something, you go and tell [Anastasio] Somoza.&#13;
He gives an order, and it's done." But not very sustainable. It's hard to make those&#13;
judgments.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: It is very hard to understand that in working [inaudible} dictatorships who&#13;
have delivered things in the past. After all, Ayub Khan in Pakistan was everybody's&#13;
darling like that. There was not understanding that when you have strong&#13;
personalities who are in power too long they ultimately destroy [inaudible} 'the good&#13;
institutions. I think that we are comprehending that a little more today, but you know&#13;
that simply means that our profession, the profession of economics, is like the&#13;
rationalization of experience. We are better at rationalizing experience, less good in&#13;
predicting our or my future [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It makes one worry. What is it that we're not seeing now?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: We'll find out. We'll possibly find out that the freeing of markets and&#13;
[inaudible] We'll find out that there were inadequate institutions. We might also find&#13;
out that we didn't quite think ofthe financing of the newly emerging private sector&#13;
and how to [inaudible] We might also find out that in this era ofunilateralism that&#13;
everything is done by the developing countries and the developed countries are sitting&#13;
on their back and enjoying their--licking their chops. I think market [inaudible]&#13;
unilateral learning of trade values, for example, by industrial countries, like the&#13;
United States with Mexico and so on, are operating with developing countries in very&#13;
respective, taking on--which means that the environment of the developing countries,&#13;
the international environment, is increasingly [inaudible} trade.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When you see these cases of the past, do you still sort of in a way think of&#13;
institutions to responses to [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Like which ones?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Like, you know, when governments make mistakes, ostensibly in a&#13;
democracy, the government's out. I'm curious. People have argued about this&#13;
institution or in general on multilateral institutions that there is the danger that they're&#13;
not, let's say, responsible to anyone.&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I think we're terribly responsible to our shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, but the shareholders, many of them, are ultimately responsible to ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yes, but the Bank is possibly helping, not with, like corporations. It&#13;
means that--take corporations like IBM. As long as they do well and they're moving&#13;
on, the management is responsible for that because most of the directors of the&#13;
corporation are their peers. Okay? The issue of responsibility arises when bad times&#13;
come. Then sort ofthe shareholders come in; then the directors come in and so on.&#13;
&#13;
I think the Bank is not that different, which means that as long as we do well and don't&#13;
have anything in red figures, our management has been since McNamara's time like&#13;
corporations. But as you can see that in the last ten years the shareholders of the Bank&#13;
have been asserting themselves a lot more, particularly with the G-7 industrial&#13;
countries, partly because there is a lot of reaction to McNamara, a very, very strong&#13;
man with his own point of view and his own thoughts who in their view hijacked the&#13;
institution and sort of used it to wash his own sins of Vietnam, brought a lot of vigor&#13;
and dynamism but in the process detracting from the, possibly, from the interests and&#13;
the policies ofthe industrial countries: "You are the darling, basically, ofthe&#13;
developing countries." So all sorts ofthings have happened.&#13;
&#13;
Of course they appoint weak presidents. In a row, they've appointed two very weak&#13;
presidents, basically, who are [inaudible] at least from the point of view of the&#13;
managers. And there is again the power of the shareholders within the Bank is far, far&#13;
greater than [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
The current crisis of the Bank, it appears, whether the Bank will sink into the sort of&#13;
UNCTAD- [United Nations Coriference on Trade and Development] UN malaise,&#13;
which means fights between the industrial and the developing countries at the level of&#13;
the Board [of Executive Directors}. And as a result the management will need to have,&#13;
its time is spent much more adjudicating the disputes between the two sides than&#13;
[inaudible] the countries, and that's a real danger to this institution.&#13;
&#13;
If you start looking at the Bank's processes even today, then you will find that the&#13;
large proportion of the processes [inaudible] are geared to internal departments rather&#13;
than to the outside. So the two biggest dangers to this institution today are precisely&#13;
(a) that it becomes an increasingly impersonal bureaucracy; second, it loses its sense&#13;
of its purpose, and it becomes really an international organization which is the arena&#13;
for the power politics of the industrialized countries.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the weak presidents have helped [inaudible] and the key question for this&#13;
institution has been the president of the Bank. He can extend a lot [inaudible] of the&#13;
institution.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The way the Bank is interacting with countries, I wonder if that is related to&#13;
this because--again, here I don't know really how right I am--but the sense that I get is&#13;
that there's much more of an all or nothing decision with respect to whether the Bank&#13;
is in or out of a country. Before you used to "yes" to this project or "no" to that&#13;
project, play around a lot more whether you were in or out. But now the Bank seems&#13;
&#13;

                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to get involved at such a high and general level in terms of the whole strategy that it's&#13;
either [inaudible] or not. I'm not sure that's right, but to the extent that that's true, that&#13;
would make it harder to stay out of some of the bilateral political games.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, I wouldn't quite characterize it as [inaudible] We are still lending to&#13;
Brazil. In the '80s we lent a billion dollars to Peru even though you had not satisfied&#13;
[inaudible] In India we are still lending for projects even though we are not satisfied.&#13;
In China we kept on lending [inaudible] political backlash due to Tiananmen Square.&#13;
It's seldom that the Bank completely stops lending to a country [inaudible] but we&#13;
think much more in terms of core and non-core issues, programs. We find that all but&#13;
the core programs [inaudible] even when we've cut down our lending programs.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's not a function of a country's size? I mean, China, Mexico, and India&#13;
are also amongst the largest clients of the Bank. And there's a sense that larger clients&#13;
have larger clout, so to speak. Is that ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, actually it's very important to these countries that we don't want to&#13;
cut off our relationship. Colombia, for example, Columbia's macroeconomic policies&#13;
have not been so creative. Basically you're helping a very regulated, rigid economy;&#13;
they've kept up [inaudible] so it's not just [inaudible] In Nigeria we've kept on doing&#13;
[inaudible] from macroeconomic [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Although that remains the largest client in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yeah, but even in small countries we have kept on doing this despite the&#13;
problems. In Guatemala we kept on trying to make project loans, while we have been&#13;
much more ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Back in the '60s, '70s, do you think the Bank made a big difference in terms&#13;
of the quality of projects delivered to lower level, grass-roots institutions; in the&#13;
government, the way projects are chosen [inaudible] managed. Was there a&#13;
substantial flow of expertise, technical assistance? It didn't really look like that much&#13;
from--or was it basically money that was being transferred?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I don't think it [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No? When the Bank lends for projects, it has always spent a lot of money in&#13;
trying to help countries to put projects, learn to make better project selection, design,&#13;
manage projects. There was a lot of expertise around projects. EDI [Economic&#13;
Development Institute] was heavily into that kind oftraining, but also the Bank&#13;
personnel that went out would always be teachers, to a large extent they were&#13;
teachers. At least, this was the story that some people--this is the way some people&#13;
remember the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Of course, of course. And missed the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And missed the Bank. They missed that Bank because they don't see it&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, that was the right thing. They expect [inaudible} That Bank arose out&#13;
of the perception that all of these countries had, was that the basic malaise of&#13;
economic development was shortage of capital, shortage of the investment base, and&#13;
therefore projects was the way of formulating really investment programs and so on&#13;
[inaudible} Second, it also coincided with the interests of our industrial countries.&#13;

                                  Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
(Very faint recording)&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Let me divide the Bank into three eras, which means the pre-McNamara,&#13;
McNamara, and post-McNamara. This era also coincided with significant changes in&#13;
the world economy and the politics of the government in the United States.&#13;
&#13;
The first part, especially the era of Gene [Eugene R.] Black, was the era ofthe&#13;
predominance ofthe United States in international relationships. And the Bank was&#13;
regarded very much as an extension ofthe concerns of the United States in those&#13;
years [inaudible] because of the confidence on their part that their interests&#13;
[inaudible] Bank and there was no attempt even to consider [inaudible] on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
When I came to the World Bank, for example, there was no person from a developing&#13;
country in higher positions.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When did you come?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: In '62. There was not a single vice president [inaudible] at the time.&#13;
&#13;
And clearly the U.S. bilateral interests and the Bank's multilateral interests were&#13;
regarded as similar if not identical. It was true [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
But the Bank probably became a truly presidential institution under McNamara,&#13;
essentially for two or three reasons. First was that he developed the Bank's own&#13;
philosophy on issues of development and the related issues of [inaudible]&#13;
development and propagated and very much contributed to the emergence of the&#13;
Bank's personality, not simply [inaudible] on development but he talked about&#13;
development. This meant the issues of poverty, rural development, urban&#13;
development, the concern with oil prices and so on.&#13;
&#13;
The second aspect of multi-lateralization, true multi-lateralization at that point, was&#13;
that McNamara, because of his personality, was able not simply to articulate the&#13;
Bank's philosophy but to project it and so on and project it externally, and he did it&#13;
extremely well. Thirdly, his personality was such that he took great pains to travel to&#13;
developing countries, spent time with them, developed personal relationships with&#13;
leaders, and there was a conviction, a growing conviction in the developing countries&#13;
that the Bank [inaudible] trust. It was home-grown, that developing countries&#13;
[inaudible] and they saw this institution as a reasonably reflective institution in terms&#13;
of interests of the third world.&#13;
&#13;
And the third world saw--that's the time when a number of people from developing&#13;
countries were given higher level positions in the World Bank, positions of influence.&#13;
Mohamed Shoaib came in as vice president under Eugene Black and in the George&#13;
Woods period he stayed on. But I became vice-president in 1974; Mahbub ul-Haq&#13;
came in as the head of the policy planning department; others had promotions, and&#13;
[inaudible] institution, to change the perception, to change the [inaudible] institution.&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then the reversal or partial reversal since McNamara left came from three or four&#13;
other factors. First was the debt crisis and basically the tremendous preoccupation, in&#13;
particular in terms of the countries of Latin America, with the debt issue and sort of&#13;
their perception as sick people, sort of a personality perception. The second one was,&#13;
of course, the incoming Ronald Reagan administration, which was extremely&#13;
suspicious of the World Bank. I went at that time to see the assistant secretary in the&#13;
Treasury for international financial affairs. He said to me, to my face, that the Bank&#13;
was a socialist organization because it was felt that we wrote off governments and the&#13;
strengthening of governments is a little bit [inaudible} And a lot of nervousness&#13;
within this institution about the relationship with the United States. In Britain you&#13;
had a conservative government at the same time. And the coming in of a president in&#13;
[Alden W.] Clausen, who did not have the strength, the intellectual strength of&#13;
McNamara nor the sort of relationship, independent relatio!lships with the leaders of&#13;
the world that McNamara had, developing countries which would help maintain the&#13;
identity and the personality of the Bank that McNamara did. And we started seeing&#13;
tremendous--the interference of the United States and others, but particularly the&#13;
United States, with the day-to-day running of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I'll give you a personal example. In 1983 I took over as Vice President of the World&#13;
Bank for Operations Policy. And the debt crisis was there. We did a lot of work on&#13;
the external debt issues, and our conclusion was--and you remember that at that time&#13;
the Bank was saying that this was a liquidity issue, it was not a structural issue&#13;
[inaudible] And so I put in process research for an analysis [inaudible} We wrote a&#13;
paper in '84. We did a lot of quantitative analysis [inaudible} It showed very&#13;
conclusively that the issue was not a liquidity issue, but it showed, for example, that&#13;
the debt crisis on a country like Cote d'Ivoire [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
At that time Chile and Argentina were [inaudible} debts. Our management was so&#13;
concerned about U.S. trade resolutions [inaudible] and in terms ofthe [inaudible]&#13;
debts and [inaudible] discussed it, first of all, in the consultative council and then the&#13;
report [inaudiblel&#13;
&#13;
If you look at the contributions of the Bank on the debt issue, it is very clear that the&#13;
Bank was not a leader on the debt problem because constantly being told by the&#13;
Treasury about what the Treasury thought about the debt problem, how it should&#13;
handled and [inaudible} which means that the same issue on debt that we had&#13;
{inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
This is what happened [inaudible} in every issue, in issues like sector issues, issues&#13;
like [inaudible]; that unlike McNamara period the Bank's attitude towards debt was&#13;
much more an indication of the concerns of investor institutions than of the internal&#13;
[inaudible] of the issue. So that's what I'm talking about [inaudible} institutions: a&#13;
fragmentation of our policy, fragmentation of [inaudible} and basically our policy&#13;
[inaudible} of the concerns of our largest shareholders {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And that's true, I would say, of the largest shareholders. Now, what did&#13;
you tell some of the other G-5?&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, it also happened at the time when the G-7 basically got their act&#13;
together in terms of their relationship with the Bank. I mean, for a while nowadays&#13;
they're coming apart again, but yet for a while there was a lot of coherence on those&#13;
issues, particularly ofthe United States and Germany and Japan. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
So there were many issues that contributed to the weakness of the developing&#13;
countries and the decreasing quality of their representation in the Bank's Board.&#13;
[inaudible] the increasing coherence of the policies ofthe industrial countries,&#13;
particularly [inaudible] G-7.&#13;
&#13;
And lastly I think the dismantling or partial dismantling of the [inaudible] institution,&#13;
but I think that despite [inaudible] the Bank in the Clausen period, the whole project&#13;
that was led by Chenery [inaudible] and selected into operations, and then the second&#13;
reorganization that [inaudible] fragmentation and bureaucratic [inaudible], and&#13;
thirdly, I think the selection of the presidents, ineffective [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just to get one thing straight: this report, was that one that Fred [Frederick&#13;
Z.] Jaspersen worked on?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's a separate report?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: That's another report. I am sure that there will be a copy in the files. Fred&#13;
Jaspersen was back here, but this was led by the Operations Policy Staff.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I hadn't heard of this report at all. I think it was before Jaspersen's report.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: There were two reports. First of all, a summary report was done in the&#13;
summer of'83, and I presented the conclusions to a lecture ofthe Bank's [inaudible]&#13;
and then sort of after this, particularly of Anne Krueger {inaudiblej It was heavily&#13;
criticized by both Ernie [Ernest] Stem and Anne Krueger, who [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Anne Krueger really thought that?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yup. It was totally political. She had not [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: She was being consulted. I mean, I can understand Stem was, but [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yes, but I suppose part ofthe whole issue was I think what you can see&#13;
after-well, one wonders--their concerns. By this time you have [inaudible] the&#13;
Bank's [inaudible] and therefore how to avoid the demands that the strategy was&#13;
associated with [inaudible] It's entirely possible that they were being, making a&#13;
tactical judgment [inaudible] And frankly, no [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And still as you say [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Let me see ifl can get hold of a copy ofthat report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, but then, going beyond the interpretation, the Bank's operation became&#13;
strongly directed by [inaudible} and by the U.S., by the Treasury's battle plan, as it&#13;
were, concentrating on Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, initially they were linked to these figures in the agreement. And in&#13;
the initial adjustment loans the only one that has possibly survived conditionality and&#13;
were [inaudible} Only in the second half of the '80s [inaudible] do we see the true&#13;
contribution of the World Bank [inaudible] sectors [inaudible] So it took time. It&#13;
took time to develop the sort of understanding of institutions and test the propositions&#13;
in real life situations.&#13;
&#13;
But if you go back, the relationship between the U.S. and the Bank, principally in the&#13;
period that McNamara was in charge here, and by the [inaudible] then you can clearly&#13;
see that the Bank at that time also was [inaudible} the question and tremendous&#13;
attempt to [inaudible] the details of the Bank, link between public goods and private&#13;
sector analysis of the [inaudible} and basically move the actual approval of line-by-&#13;
line [inaudible} Directors, [inaudible] holding the IDA hostage to [inaudible} to&#13;
discussion of actual spending. So there have been some instruments. IDA had these&#13;
IDA replenishments [inaudible} setting up bi-lateral [inaudible] IDA, whether it was&#13;
IFC's capital increase [inaudible} Bank's operations, thereby [inaudible} issues.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you see a kind of link in the '60s and early '70s, seeing as there's this&#13;
whole issue of expropriations. And in that case it was physical assets. In the late '80s&#13;
it was financial assets. And again it was, for example, the U.S. and Peru, France and&#13;
Algeria, but mainly the U.S. It was more confined to Latin America, although it was&#13;
Zaire and Belgium also. And I'm sure you must have been aware of that at that time,&#13;
and the Bank was very reluctant to lend because of opposition again from the U.S.&#13;
Do you see it as ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, expropriation was [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Except that the Bank did lend.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: We did not lend. In Latin America there had been expropriations, I know,&#13;
that there were also during the '60s. It was a minor irritant. We used to get letters&#13;
from [inaudible] that the situation on the expropriation of [inaudible] It didn't&#13;
immediately affect our lending. And yet it was written in our policies. But I cannot&#13;
see how it led to the situations [inaudible] not have something. The Aswan Dam&#13;
issue. For example, the mediation in South Africa [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was it one ofthe reasons for not lending to [Salvador ]Allende?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: No, I don't think so. I remember I talked to McNamara in those days, and&#13;
he told me that he genuinely had tried to work, but that this was a domestic economic&#13;
plan [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Peru was interrupted for a while on this.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Peru was, yes, yes. That was basically because of [inaudible] situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I wonder--sometimes when I think of U.S. influence, I wonder--it seems that&#13;
the U.S. is [inaudible} to being the ogre, but that the reasons that you developed so&#13;
well, I mean, McNamara was able to create a sort of space around the Bank, but that&#13;
that went with a certain amount of understanding. In other words, McNamara was&#13;
very close to U.S. policy.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: He was very astute. But, you know, it's interesting about McNamara.&#13;
McNamara looked at an identity between the U.S. interests and the World Bank&#13;
interests in a strategic way. It means that his view came from his geo-political view&#13;
of things. He felt--and basically he was a cold warrior. He was a cold warrior, but as&#13;
a cold warrior he was not a [Henry A.} Kissinger type of cold warrior, but he went&#13;
beyond that because he also saw that the issues of poverty and hunger had something&#13;
to do with violence. You remember his famous speech at MIT [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: And whenever I talked to him, you could see that. For example, his&#13;
tremendous concern even before he came to the Bank about poverty and about&#13;
[inaudible} about others.&#13;
&#13;
He told me that the first weekend he arrived at the Bank, he came in and he took a&#13;
graph paper and put in the left hand column every country in order of population and&#13;
in the right hand he put the cumulative Bank lending. And two countries stuck in his&#13;
eyes, Egypt and Indonesia, where the Bank had done no lending. Egypt, which had&#13;
done that famous loan for the opening of the Suez Canal, but beyond that [inaudible]&#13;
And he was very much concerned about Indonesia, again from Vietnam days, East&#13;
Asia and so on. And he immediately focused on these two countries. It led to a huge&#13;
program in Indonesia and a Bank mission in Indonesia and so on, and in respect, this&#13;
large, strategic country, its economic development had to be looked on.&#13;
&#13;
So McNamara's concern with poverty, while it was an extension of his geo-political&#13;
concern and was a strategic concern, day to day he was not prepared to submit the&#13;
Bank to the U.S. pressure in a very overt way. He told me of two instances about this,&#13;
one in which I was personally involved. He told me that in 1971 during the India-&#13;
Pakistan War he was under great pressure from the State Department because they-&#13;
[William P.j Rogers--to stop an agreement. And he said that once he heard from&#13;
Rogers, he said back to Rogers, "You don't [inaudible] it up any country. We can't&#13;
do that." The second was the incoming of China in 1980 when he personally led the&#13;
mission to negotiate with China with tremendous opposition from the U.S.&#13;
[inaudible] negotiate with China and came back and [inaudible] My view is that ifhe&#13;
hadn't done it, it wouldn't have happened for a long time. So these are the two&#13;
personal things I know of his working despite the U.S.'s interests. So he did see the&#13;
identity of the U.S. interest and the World Bank's interest in a strategic sense, but he Â·&#13;
was not prepared for the day to day submission of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why did he cave in on the Vietnam [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I was very deeply involved on Vietnam, and-1 have a piece of paper&#13;
which has ...&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You mentioned Kissinger. We've been puzzled by his closeness to&#13;
Kissinger. Do you know where that came from?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: He told me that, McNamara--! don't think you should quote me on this--&#13;
but he told me that whenever he had any difficulty with [Richard M] Nixon, he&#13;
would call Kissinger, who would solve the problem. He had a tremendous regard for&#13;
Kissinger's personal qualities.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I think Kissinger also helped with the reappointment. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yes, he must have.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But you don't know where it came from?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: It must have come from the pre-Nixon days, I'm sure. I'm sure that it&#13;
must have come from his days as Secretary of Defense while Kissinger was&#13;
[inaudible] on foreign policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I mean, one way to interpret it is--I was reading this article in the Post about&#13;
the letters between Albert Schweitzer and Albert Einstein, and Schweitzer is saying,&#13;
"Well, isn't it interesting. They always talk about us as the two Alberts." They were&#13;
both [inaudible} There's something like that with Kissinger and McNamara, and I&#13;
wonder if they were sort of conscious of that.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Their sort ofhistoric [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Very few people in the U.S. at that level had the sense of the rest of&#13;
the world, as Kissinger had. It would be interesting. They could talk about Mrs.&#13;
[Indira} Gandhi and [Anwar] Sadat with no [both speaking at once] Maybe that was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: McNamara, he knew them personally. I once asked McNamara sort of&#13;
[inaudible] who had a gift [inaudible] He said John Kennedy. I said why. He said&#13;
John Kennedy had such a great understanding on a variety of issues. I think the&#13;
second one he said was the Shah of Iran.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Really?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yeah, he said to me that personally he had such great admiration for the&#13;
Shah of Iran because [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was that before or after the Shah threw the Bank out?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What I was trying to, beginning to get at before when I talked about&#13;
McNamara, I wonder--to be a bit of a devil's advocate in regard to the interpretation-&#13;
&#13;
                                S. Shahid Husain&#13;
                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
whether some ofthis was apparent, some ofthis space or independence, maybe&#13;
whether there wasn't, because he was so American, so close and sort of on the same&#13;
wavelength, that a lot of things could be done without, with no visibility, just sheer&#13;
understanding in conversation, so that in that sense maybe there was a little less;&#13;
whereas in the '80s, I wonder whether a lot of the U.S. pushiness is really more&#13;
minor, sort of more overt, bothersome, but is there a structural situation where ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I think that in the U.S. there was a real transition from internationalism.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Put it another way-excuse me--to try to explain it a little, isn't the Treasury&#13;
very frustrated? Do think they are frustrated by the Bank, by the fact that they haven't&#13;
gotten more from the Bank [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I have two or three explanations. One is just the change in the U.S.&#13;
[inaudible] because basically the whole Democratic era and the Nixon era in the&#13;
United States was very much internationalist. It was an era of confidence; it was an&#13;
era of U.S. political stability in the world, but also an era where the international&#13;
relations, relations with developing countries were an integral part of Cold War, and&#13;
the economic assistance, whether it was any part of [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
I think that the Reagan era was an era of pulling back, of getting back to the very old&#13;
Republican type of isolationism. They also had confidence that all that mattered was&#13;
[inaudible], hence the tremendous accent on [inaudible] of expenditures, a certain&#13;
amount of disdain for developing countries, also a [inaudible] for what was perceived&#13;
to be the tremendous power of OPEC [Organization ofPetroleum Exporting&#13;
Countries] since in 1973 to 1988 [inaudible] and the variety of the developing&#13;
countries as beholden to OPEC, the whole rhetoric ofthe new international economic&#13;
order and a very conscious attempt to sort of destroy this, what they would have&#13;
regarded as illegitimate increase in power of the imposters, the Arabs, the OPEC&#13;
peoples, and of course the developing countries. And they saw the World Bank as an&#13;
instrument because the World Bank had not decried against OPEC; they explicitly&#13;
condemned the World Bank for it. They have seen the World Bank as an instrument&#13;
that [inaudible] very deliberate desire to sort of get rid of that legacy, that heritage,&#13;
and sort of to cut the Bank down, and I think a very explicit, conscious desire to&#13;
control this institution day-to-day. I mean, they were, they said so, that McNamara&#13;
had taken the institution out of the control of the U.S. and there had to be a roll-back.&#13;
So that's that frame of mind. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] What is that ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: This is the basic [inaudible] Take a look at the other notes [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. I [inaudible] reference on them.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I have the sense--well, the ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: [inaudible] Have you been given access to all the files?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Everything, yes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Do you want a copy of this?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That would be ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: It is one ofthe most significant things that has happened. One really has&#13;
the whole [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Go ahead and make a copy it. '79. So it's a note to the file?&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Because I thought that-1 mean, going through the file I thought that&#13;
McNamara gave in shortly after Vietnam on the PLO [Palestine Liberation&#13;
Organization] issue, in the annual meeting that was in-'81?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: In '79 in Belgrade.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In '79, right. I mean, it's quite clear, even if you have the [Robert D.}&#13;
Muldoon Commission report and so on, that the Bank--you know, the voting tally was&#13;
the first time that all the governments voted on this issue in the Bank, [inaudible}&#13;
issue. It closed the ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, McNamara always asked how would it have hurt or not helped the&#13;
Bank. I think he was seriously concerned that if the PLO were seated as observers it&#13;
would lead to such a backlash in the United States that it would destroy IDA. And he&#13;
was not prepared to do that. He was too committed and at that point in particular to&#13;
the development of India and Africa that he probably would have given almost any&#13;
chance to save IDA.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has IDA been for long dealing with the fact the Bank without [inaudible]&#13;
being the one source? With each, every IDA replenishment increasing, there are&#13;
more ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: More open issues, more sort ofthings that are coming up?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yes, it is. It is. A principal instrument, I think, for introducing the&#13;
[inaudible] The sheer fact of its being in Washington, the sheer fact that the U.S. has&#13;
tremendous possibilities for day to day [inaudible} For example, about a year and a&#13;
half ago the Brazilians were sort of dragging their feet on negotiations with&#13;
commercial banks. The U.S. wanted the Bank to stop its [inaudible] and was&#13;
becoming very, very concerned about the terms [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I thought at some earlier point they had done the reverse, which was to&#13;
persuade the Bank to lend sort of faster to {inaudible} Latin America, sort of&#13;
commercial [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                 July 2, 1991 and September 29, 1992- Verbatim&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yeah, but it has changed now. It's a very--on Brazil it has been sort of-&#13;
I mean, the government ofBrazil has changed. About a year and a half ago they were&#13;
very insistent that [inaudible] stop and [inaudible] negotiate [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did the Bank have any kind of a position-it must be around the mid-'80s--&#13;
commercial banks were requiring debtors to nationalize, private commercial banks.&#13;
This became a big issue in Chile that was fueled and reversed itself; it went along but&#13;
it gave in to the pressure. In other words, the Chilean government ..&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: The private debts?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: The Fund was much firmer on that than the Bank was.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Fund was. Defending ...&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Trying to persuade Chile not to nationalize the private debt.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: [inaudible} talk to Chileans and say [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Would there be any traces ofthat kind of position?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The commercial banks were trying to deal more broadly in Latin America&#13;
at the time.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, you mentioned [inaudible] Chile and Mexico they nationalized the&#13;
banks.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In Peru they did, too, before Alan Garcia.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Yes. [inaudible} Latin America strategy is so obvious. I think lending&#13;
[inaudible] and I think the Bank lent to these private banks on the select occasions,&#13;
actually. I think that was an important role.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, sovereign debt is-in some countries risk didn't exist.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You mentioned that in the case ofBrazil you had two later encounters&#13;
[inaudible] And it seems, going through all the files ofthe '70s and '80s, the absence&#13;
of Europe is quite-I mean, it's fairly conspicuous, almost, their absence: German&#13;
interest in the Bank, the French were very narrowly focused on Francophone Africa-&#13;
is that right?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: In the '70s the Germans were always very supportive, no questions asked.&#13;
[inaudible] The Germans were totally [inaudible] the Bank. The French were very&#13;
much [inaudible] You are right. The famous dual tracks. And I said the Bank's, the&#13;
Bretton Woods vision ofthe institution totally [inaudible] captivated the Europeans&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But the '80s?&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Very different. McNamara was gone; they were also facing bilateral&#13;
problems. Basically right-of-center governments in every country: Britain, Germany,&#13;
here. And their political line was actually--and as I said, they were sort of:&#13;
"McNamara was a kind of rogue elephant that ran away with it." A clear desire for&#13;
[inaudibleJ the institution.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There is something in the nature of a coup, really, in the way things have&#13;
changed here right at the top: [inaudible} Clausen, Krueger. Could you [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: I'll give you an example. We had a very carefully negotiated agreement&#13;
with China that on the World Bank documents Taiwan would be referred to as Taiwan&#13;
rather than China. And then the [inaudible] and Clausen came. And one of the first&#13;
acts of Clausen was to have that changed, because the Taiwanese were becoming&#13;
[inaudible} and it was changed by almost the very first week of Clausen to&#13;
Taiwan/China not Taiwan [inaudible] A little thing, but it was a major political issue&#13;
at that time. [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Steel, there was an intervention by Clausen in the steel industry ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was [Barber B.] Conable.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, Conable.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When I was looking at the way the Bank has tried reforming-it seems in&#13;
the case of India they could not get reform going [inaudible} so the strategy was&#13;
sector approach, I mean the industrial sector, cement and so on. And in '85-'86 they&#13;
had, with the new regime in India, negotiated a set of key loans for steel. It was all&#13;
public sector [inaudible} And then one suddenly sees this thing ofConable saying no.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Conable said that.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: And it's very rare for a, the regional vice president--in any case, that&#13;
would be my assumption--to agree to a set of [inaudible] And at the same time I first&#13;
thought that maybe there was public sector reluctance. The Bank was continuing to&#13;
lend to China on steel and Mexico. Conable had made it clear that he was very&#13;
worried about surplus capacity [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Ultimately the Bank stopped lending for any steel loans. Conable was&#13;
very susceptible to Congressional pressure, day to day Congressional pressures.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was clearly one which he himself personally was ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: With Clausen it was more of the Treasury pressure? Did Congress have&#13;
much access to him?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: Well, he didn't have probably as much access to Congress as Conable had,&#13;
and much more to Treasury. But in Conable's time the balance-at least until David&#13;
[inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Conable almost winces every time he mentions [David C.] Mulford's name.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This has really been helpful. Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
HUSAIN: You can use it [refers to document] but after you use it, keep it to&#13;
yourselves.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We will, we will, just the two of us and John [Lewis].&#13;
