The Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Group of WBI (WBIEP) conducted a core&#13;
course on Economic Growth in Washington, D.C. from January 20-21, 1999. This is the third&#13;
offering of this course; previous offerings were held in Washington, D.C. in February and&#13;
June, 1998 (This course has been offered in different forms in other countries at previous&#13;
times. This evaluation reviews the three D.C. offerings due to the similarities among the&#13;
courses). The two-day course was aimed at strengthening participants' analytical and&#13;
research skills in the field of economic growth. The course was designed to provide both a&#13;
theoretical framework for and empirical studies of the determinants of economic growth, as&#13;
well as an understanding of policy issues for achieving equitable and sustainable growth.&#13;
Thirty-two participants attended this course, all World Bank staff. The course included 12&#13;
women, 37.5% of all participants.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the WBI Evaluation Unit (WBIES) using a Level 1 (participants'&#13;
reaction) end-of-course evaluation questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 21&#13;
respondents, 65.6% of the total number of participants. The questionnaire asked&#13;
respondents to give their views about course relevance, benefits, design and trainers. The&#13;
results of the questionnaire were used to compare this course to the previous two courses.&#13;
Each of the previous courses had 51 participants, including individuals from Partner&#13;
Institutions and World Bank economists. In contrast, this offering had 32 participants, all&#13;
World Bank staff. Additionally, unlike those used in the two previous offerings, the&#13;
questionnaire did not measure participants' self-assessed learning gains.&#13;
&#13;
A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate&#13;
respondents' answers to the questions in each section. Following are the major evaluation&#13;
findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  As in previous offerings, the overall usefulness of the course exceeded 3.0 on a 5-&#13;
        point scale, achieving a mean score of 4.4 for this indicator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  For all questions on the relevancy of the course, respondents indicated that the&#13;
        course was most relevant in meeting their personal learning needs. The mean score&#13;
        for this indicator was 4.6; 94.7% of respondents chose either 4 or 5 on the 5-point&#13;
        scale for this indicator. It is worth noting that this score was higher than that of the&#13;
        two previous offerings, and that this indicator has had the highest mean score for each&#13;
        of the three D.C. offerings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Ratings on the effectiveness of trainers reflect the consistent quality of presenters for&#13;
        this course. Ninety-five percent of respondents selected 4 or 5 out of 5 for overall&#13;
        quality of the trainers' answers to the participants' questions, (mean=4.5). Ninety-one&#13;
        percent selected 4 or 5 for overall effectiveness of the trainers in communicating their&#13;
        messages (mean=4.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The mean scores for the indicators on course design ranged from 3.9 (usefulness of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      the training materials for you up to now) to 4.4 (effectiveness of the course in&#13;
      maintaining your interest during its full duration). Participants felt strongly that the&#13;
      discussions were constructive and that the presentations were useful (mean=4.3 for&#13;
      each). With the exception of usefulness of the training materials for you up to now, all&#13;
      of the course design indicators scored higher than they did in the previous two&#13;
      offerings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Participants were asked to respond to four additional course design indicators using a&#13;
      different 5-point scale. This scale ranges from 1=insufficient to 5=excessive. The&#13;
      midpoint for this scale, 3=adequate, is the optimal score. For each of these&#13;
      indicators, a majority of the respondents selected the "adequate" category. While&#13;
      only 55% of the respondents felt that the group was adequate with regard to the&#13;
      diversity of participants, 30% of respondents held no opinion on this indicator. In&#13;
      contrast to the previous offerings, each of which included participants from Partner&#13;
      Institutions as well as Bank staff, this course targeted a more homogeneous group&#13;
      (Bank staff). A question regarding participant diversity may be inappropriate for a&#13;
      course which specifically targets a homogeneous group. This may explain the large&#13;
      number of respondents who held no opinion on participant diversity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  As in the past, indicators measuring the extent to which the course helped&#13;
      participants better assess various policy alternatives had ratings relatively lower than&#13;
      course indicators on relevance, design and trainers. Mean scores ranged from 3.6 to&#13;
      3.8 (61.9% to 66.7% of respondents selected 4 or 5 out of 5 for these indicators).&#13;
      Respondents' increase in familiarity with policies that have worked well in some cases&#13;
      had a mean score of 3.8. This was the highest mean score for this group of indicators.&#13;
      In previous offerings it has been the lowest mean score among the same group of&#13;
      indicators. One question asked respondents to rate the adaptability to their situation&#13;
      of the policies discussed. Respondents' mean score for this indicator was 3.6, the&#13;
      lowest mean score among all course performance indicators. The task managers are&#13;
      advised to continue working on the issue of course benefits with regard to policy&#13;
      options in the design stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  The pattern among course indicators has not changed significantly between offerings.&#13;
      The following charts A, B and C illustrate the pattern among groups of indicators for&#13;
      the three offerings (February 1998, June 1998 and January 1999). As can be seen,&#13;
      collective mean scores for "relevance", "trainers" and "overall" indicators tend to be&#13;
      the highest, while collective means for "benefits" indicators are consistently the&#13;
      lowest. Again, the task managers may wish to focus on the benefits of the course&#13;
      with regard to the extent to which the course helped participants better assess&#13;
      various policy options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chart A: Collective mean scores for groups of indicators in the February, 1998&#13;
offering.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chart B: Collective mean scores for groups of indicators in the June, 1998 offering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chart C: Collective mean scores for groups of indicators in the January, 1999&#13;
offering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  When considering that this offering had higher mean scores on many indicators than&#13;
      did the previous offerings, it is important to note the change in the size and&#13;
      composition of the group of participants in this offering. The course was smaller in&#13;
      size by roughly 37%. Some of the indicators which may have logically been affected&#13;
      by course size are the extent to which the discussions were constructive, the overall&#13;
      effectiveness of the trainers in communicating their message, and overall quality of&#13;
      the trainers' answers to the participants questions. Table 1, shown below, compares&#13;
      the mean scores for these indicators across all three offerings. As can be seen, the&#13;
      most recent course, which was significantly smaller, yielded impressively higher&#13;
      mean scores for the selected indicators. We should be cautious in interpreting these&#13;
      results. There was also a rise in mean scores between the February and June&#13;
      offerings (no change in course size). However, a higher gain was seen from June to&#13;
      January 1999, ranging from .23 to .43 points (the rise in these mean scores from&#13;
      February to June ranged from only .02 points to .07 points).&#13;

                         February 98            June 98                   January 99&#13;

the participants'&#13;
questions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    l A criterion for judging the effectiveness of WBI training is for at least 85 percent of&#13;
      respondents to give a satisfaction rating of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. The fact that so&#13;
      many of the indicators used in this questionnaire scored above this 85 percent mark&#13;
      is promising. Regarding the overall usefulness of the course, in this offering 95.2&#13;
      percent of respondents selected a 4 or 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    l A Level II measure of participant knowledge was not used in this evaluation. Task&#13;
      managers are advised to continue to track self-assessed learning gains, as well as&#13;
      actual learning gains using cognitive testing (where applicable), in the future.&#13;

            The Economic Policy and Poverty
            Reduction Group of World Bank Institute (WBIEP) conducted a
            core course on economic growth in Washington, D.C. from
            January 20-21, 1999. This is the third offering of this
            course; previous offerings were held in Washington, D.C. in
