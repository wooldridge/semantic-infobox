                                                Foreword&#13;
     Provision of safe drinking water is a basic necessity and has been a major topic for key political discourses in the&#13;
     country over the last decade. The Government of India has been focusing on safe drinking water since 1972-73&#13;
     when it introduced the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP) to assist States/Union Territories&#13;
     to accelerate the coverage of drinking water in the country. Despite increased outlays since then, access to safe&#13;
     drinking water in India remains a challenge. Apart from access, water quality and sustainability of resources&#13;
     (water points and infrastructure developed) are issues of major concern.&#13;
&#13;
     The National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which is supplementing the efforts of the State&#13;
     Governments by providing technical and financial assistance, is looking at rural drinking water from a holistic&#13;
     viewpoint. The Ministry has shifted its focus from hand pumps to piped water supply systems with the aim of&#13;
     providing monitored clean water and is focusing on those States which have low levels of piped water supply.&#13;
&#13;
     The Water and Sanitation Program has compiled an excellent collection of success stories and best practices&#13;
     from the States of Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Punjab and Uttarakhand which address&#13;
     these key constraints. Some of these success stories, such as the Asoga village intervention in Karnataka which&#13;
     showcases a unique demand driven approach to facilitate participatory decision making leading to community&#13;
     ownership, the Bidholi piped water supply scheme in Uttarakhand which manages and recovers 100 per cent&#13;
     operation and maintenance costs from the community, the Shikayat Nivaran Kendra experiment in Punjab&#13;
     which uses information technology for online web enabled centralised complaint redressal and the Water and&#13;
     Sanitation Management Organisation experiment in Gujarat where the registered body acts as a facilitator in&#13;
     developing water and sanitation facilities owned and managed by communities, are all outstanding examples of&#13;
     how to address various challenges and shortcomings the programme is facing.&#13;
&#13;
     I am sure that this compendium of best practices can play a major role in educating the State Governments and&#13;
     translating some of the learnings from these success stories to their State models to give a fillip to the NRDWP&#13;
     interventions in the country.&#13;

&amp;#12;Innovative Approaches to&#13;
Sustainable Operation and&#13;
Maintenance&#13;
Asoga Village, Belgaum District, Karnataka&#13;
&amp;#12;Taking on New Challenges | A Compendium of Good Practices in Rural Water Supply Schemes&#13;
&#13;
               Asoga village in Karnataka has used a unique&#13;
               demand-driven approach to facilitate participatory&#13;
               decision making at all levels, leading to the&#13;
               communityâ&#128;&#153;s ownership of the scheme and its&#13;
               willingness to pay the water tariff promptly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background                                                              assisted rural drinking water supply project introduced&#13;
Before the implementation of the scheme, Asoga,                         a new participatory approach to planning and&#13;
a village comprising 225 households, met its water                      implementation of the scheme, making it mandatory&#13;
supply requirements from three bore wells fitted with                   for the Village Water and Sanitation Committee&#13;
hand pumps and a piped water supply with an open                        (VWSC) under the Gram Panchayat (GP) to assume&#13;
well as the source. Water from the open well was                        responsibility for its operations. User involvement&#13;
pumped to the 25,000-litre capacity ground level                        brought about a vast change: from being passive&#13;
storage reservoir (GLSR) using 5 horse power (HP)                       recipients of water supply services provided by the&#13;
submersible pumps through a rising main. Water                          state, the villagers became owners and providers&#13;

estimated to cost approximately `80 lakh.&#13;
The per capita cost came to `6,585 which&#13;
was significantly higher than the World Bank&#13;
funding norms of `2,000 per capita. Hence,&#13;
alternatives were studied.&#13;

Technical Evaluation in&#13;
Consultation with the Community&#13;
During the search for a suitable site to construct the&#13;
jack well, the technical team came across a natural         Box 1.1: Slide Rail Arrangement&#13;

&#13;
of a jack well at this location. The technical team,        embedded on the river bank with a concrete&#13;

in consultation with the VWSC, then came up with            block and provided with 20 mm mild steel bars at&#13;

&#13;
modifications were studied.                                 along the channels, the platform is tied with a mild&#13;

Once the slide rail arrangement for drawing river           installed on the river bank. By rotating the drum,&#13;

&#13;
Plant (WPT). The initial calculations indicated a&#13;
requirement for a 300 metre (m) x 200 m site to&#13;
house WTP components including the slow sand&#13;
filter. As Asoga is a small village, surrounded by&#13;
forests, such a large area of land was not available&#13;
nearby. Therefore, the technical team decided to test&#13;
the applicability of a bed micron sand filter in place of&#13;
the conventional slow sand filter for water treatment.&#13;
The bed micron sand filter was found to be compact,&#13;

&#13;
A meeting of the VWSC was held in mid-2011&#13;
in which the members agreed that resource&#13;
mobilisation through collection of water tariff and&#13;
legalisation of unregistered connections were critical&#13;
for operationalising the scheme. Mr. Bhagat held&#13;
discussions with the officers of the Drinking Water&#13;
and Sanitation Department (DWSD), Government&#13;
of Jharkhand (GoJ), and agreed with the officersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
assessment that the scheme had a troubled history&#13;
(see Boxes 2.1 and 2.2) and its revival would require&#13;
resources to repair technical faults and ensure timely&#13;
and adequate water supply. He also acknowledged&#13;
the crucial role that community members needed to&#13;
play to ensure the schemeâ&#128;&#153;s success. However, he was&#13;
confident that, once services improved, consumers&#13;
would agree to pay the outstanding tariff, and&#13;
resources for future operations would be generated.&#13;
	&#13;
Once the problems had been understood and possible                  (households with house connections), expressed their&#13;
solutions arrived at, the VWSC convened a Gram                      grievances. A summary of the communityâ&#128;&#153;s concerns&#13;

  Box 2.2: Key Issues Identified by the VWSC at                     community. Firstly, Mr. Bhagat made an innovative&#13;
  the Time of Handover                                              appeal to the existing beneficiaries through personal&#13;

of the GPs. In each village in the Zilla Panchayat               Metered House Connections in&#13;
(ZP), a VWSC has been formed. A VWSC comprises                   Dakshina Kannada District&#13;
elected and non-elected members. Some VWSCs                      Enthused by the success of decentralised professional&#13;
employ their own staff to carry out the day-to-day               management of water supply and 100 per cent&#13;
management of the water supply scheme. The scheme                volumetric metering of household connections, a&#13;
level committees are federated at the GP level and               number of scheme providers initiated measures to&#13;
headed by the President of the GP. The VWSCs                     achieve improved cost recovery. One such initiative&#13;
have been granted independence from the GPs in                   was in the area of tariff setting. A majority of the&#13;
terms of management, accounting and financing                    VWSCs have adopted slab tariffs: the first level&#13;
systems. The VWSC meets once a month to review                   (representing 40-55 litre per capita per day (lpcd)&#13;
the schemeâ&#128;&#153;s status and performance. It discloses the            consumption) is charged at `40-60 per month per&#13;

case of the Guthakadu village water supply scheme in             given the fact that the VWSC enjoys independence&#13;

organisation, the Guthakadu Rajeeva Gandhi                       systems. For example, O&amp;M, electricity and&#13;
Kudiyuva Neeru Balakedarara Sangha provides water                personnel charges are paid directly by the VWSC&#13;
to the village. The organisation submits the annual              from the revenue collected from water services. This&#13;
statement of accounts to the office of the Deputy                makes it easy to understand the overall surplus/deficit&#13;

GPs in Dakshina Kannada district have separated&#13;
the roles of entities responsible for supplying water&#13;
and providing services. In the process, they have&#13;
ensured that the quality of water service delivery is&#13;
notâ&#128;&#137;â&#128;&#137;compromised.&#13;
&#13;
In 2002, GoK issued orders stipulating that the&#13;
GPs should recover full O&amp;M costs from users and&#13;
that development grants should not be diverted to&#13;
cover O&amp;M expenses. An important measure that&#13;
the GPs initiated to recover full O&amp;M costs was&#13;
to move towards metered house connections. The&#13;
VWSC of the Kinnigoli GP first introduced 100 per&#13;
cent volumetric metering. Its efficient management&#13;
of the water scheme resulting from 100 per cent&#13;
metering made headlines in the local media. The&#13;
media attention attracted visitors from other GPs to&#13;
study the system which involved practices adopted for&#13;
household connections, regular meter reading, repair&#13;
of meters and tariff setting to recover O&amp;M costs&#13;
fully. Thereafter, a number of GPs in the&#13;
district replicated the metering system in their&#13;

Strategy and Approach                                                            been selected through a structured process to act as&#13;
WASMOâ&#128;&#153;s approach (see Figure 4.1) is that of                                     implementation support agencies in the villages.&#13;
a facilitator in developing water and sanitation&#13;
facilities in villages that are owned and managed by                             Further, WASMO is closely associated with the&#13;
the communities on the principles of cost sharing                                state office of UNICEF and its Child Environment&#13;
and ensuring a decentralised service delivery with                               Programme. In the early years, UNICEF provided&#13;
the ultimate aim of providing assured safe water                                 cash support to build a district core team of the&#13;
in a sustainable manner. The empowerment of the                                  Swajaldhara Project. It also supported WASMO&#13;
communities is a process-driven approach, depicted                               through training and field test kits for its water&#13;
in Box 4.1.                                                                      quality programme. Through support from UNICEF,&#13;
                                                                                 WASMO has been able to organise various capacity&#13;
The second innovative mechanism was building strong                              building programmes for its staff on themes such as&#13;
partnerships with non-governmental organisations                                 gender sensitisation, leadership and team building&#13;
(NGOs), civil society and international organisations.                           skills, documentation of processes and success stories.&#13;
WASMO has built partnerships with over 75 NGOs&#13;
based on clarity in roles and responsibilities. This has                         A unique initiative supported by UNICEF, â&#128;&#152;office-in-&#13;
led to the development of operational relationships,                             a-bagâ&#128;&#153; (provision of stationery kits to Pani Samitis),&#13;
which recognise and capitalise on each otherâ&#128;&#153;s skills                            which started as an experiment, has gained much&#13;
and strengths. Accountability, respect and trust have                            favour with the community. This kit, distributed to&#13;
been the key elements for this synergy. NGOs have                                community members at the beginning of programme&#13;

               households in Hebballi receive satisfactory quality&#13;

               equity and sustainability played a significant role in&#13;
               the implementation of the Hebballi piped water&#13;
               supply project.&#13;
&#13;

Background                                                              project included the construction of a recharge tank&#13;
Hebballi, a village comprising 236 households, met                      next to one of the bore wells. The VWSC has been&#13;

bore wells and hand pumps. The water supply system                      for the last nine years.&#13;
was grossly inadequate. In fact, Hebballi faced all the&#13;
water supply challenges that a typical village faces in                 Community participation, equity and sustainability&#13;

water pumps and poor water quality. Disputes were                       while the water supply system was constructed by&#13;
regular at the water point and the situation became                     a local contractor hired by the ZPED, the VWSC&#13;
worse in the summer.                                                    was involved in supervising the construction of the&#13;

In 2003-04, GoK implemented a new piped                                 technical skills that later made it possible for them to&#13;

International Developmental Agency (DANIDA)-                            to Mr. Rameshwarappa, the current President of the&#13;
assisted rural drinking water supply project. Jalanidhiâ&#128;&#153;s               VWSC, the VWSC took a conscious decision to take&#13;
approach to planning, implementation and O&amp;M                            up construction supervision. This was influenced by&#13;
of drinking water supply schemes, based on direct                       the fact that there was a dedicated team of specialists&#13;
participation of the user community and the formation                   from ZPED, DANIDA and NGOs who would guide&#13;
of a VWSC under the GP, transformed the village                         them through the intricacies of a water supply project&#13;
community from passive users to owners and providers                    while local experience in construction would help in&#13;
of water services. GoK provided 85 per cent of the                      ensuring quality construction. VWSCâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in&#13;
capital costs, users contributed 10 per cent and the                    construction supervision gave it a sense of ownership&#13;
remaining 5 per cent was provided by the GP. In order                   which has turned out to be a significant factor in&#13;
to enable the project to accomplish its stated objectives,              ensuring that the system functions properly.&#13;
GoK, DANIDA and other state agencies provided key&#13;
support at critical times to all the stakeholders.                      To ensure equitable distribution, Hebballi instituted&#13;

The scheme consists of two bore wells, at a depth                       group connections. In another innovative move, a&#13;

Currently, every drop of water that is supplied to&#13;
Hebballi village is accounted for and promptly paid&#13;
for. The â&#128;&#152;pay according to usageâ&#128;&#153; concept has not only&#13;
boosted VWSCâ&#128;&#153;s revenues but has also generated&#13;
interest among other VWSCs in the region. Moreover,&#13;
it has instilled a sense of accountability in the villagers&#13;
that ensures less wastage of water. Currently, 218 of the&#13;
236 households in the village have individual metered&#13;
connections. The remaining households are catered to&#13;
through metered group connections.&#13;

However, the provision of incentives enabled these                bore wells, which covers a large catchment to ensure&#13;

   Box 6.1: Case Study of the Charadih GP Multi-Village Scheme, Koderma District, Jharkhand&#13;
&#13;
   A groundwater based Charadih Grameen Pipe Jalapurthi Yojana was implemented in Charadih GP to cover four&#13;
   villages. Three villages, Charadih, Kanyavan and Putto, are located in the Charadih GP while Khanoongaon Bhiga&#13;
   is located in Jhumri Panchayat. At present, the multi-village water supply scheme (MVWSS) delivers water to three&#13;
   villages in the Charadih GP while the distribution network is being laid in Khanoongaon Bhiga village. The MVWSS&#13;
   consists of two bore wells that are located near the river and are fitted with a 5 HP submersible pump which delivers&#13;
   water to a 25,000 gallon capacity overhead tank located about 1,500 m from the bore well. Once the infrastructure&#13;
   to cover the three villages was in place, the project was handed over to a committee comprising members of all&#13;
   the three villages. The Jal Upbhokta Samiti (JUS) has been carrying out O&amp;M of the project since 1 January 2011.&#13;
   At present, 213 private household connections have been provided at a payment of `310 each. To encourage all&#13;
   residents to take private connections, stand posts have been discontinued. A monthly tariff of `100 per household&#13;
   is levied. The connection fee and tariff are deposited in a separate bank account in the name of the JUS. At present,&#13;
   the JUS bank account has a balance of `2,49,780. Water supply is provided for 45 minutes every day in all the three&#13;
   villages. JUS holds monthly meetings to discuss issues pertaining to water supply and carries out remedial measures&#13;
   to ensure supply to all villages every day. Community participation in the scheme has been of a high order as&#13;
   reflected by the fact that one of the Samiti members provided private land for constructing the overhead tank.&#13;
&#13;
   In a departure from the usual norm in villages, male members of families were involved in fetching drinking water&#13;
   prior to this project. Now the project has enabled them to find regular job opportunities. Health benefits of the&#13;
   scheme are indicated by lower incidences of diarrhoea. Realising the economic and health benefits of the scheme,&#13;
   the community makes tariff payments promptly. The success of the project for the last two years has enabled JUS&#13;
   members to gain confidence to start planning the construction of an additional overhead tank to cover the water&#13;
   demand of all households and installation of solar pumps to reduce electricity charges. Thus, the transfer of the&#13;
   O&amp;M of the water supply to JUS enabled the villagers to not only realise its benefits but also led to their developing&#13;
   a sense of ownership with a willingness to invest in its success.&#13;

story of one of the schemes that was transferred to the            to ensure community participation, SWSM engaged&#13;
Water User Committee (WUC) in January 2011 is                      the services of external stakeholders such as the NGO&#13;
provided in Box 6.1.                                               PRADHAN which had successfully implemented a&#13;
                                                                   similar water supply programme in Bhelkhera village in&#13;
Encouraging Stakeholder                                            Koderma district (see Box 6.2 for details).&#13;
Involvement&#13;
Transferring the responsibility for O&amp;M of the water&#13;
supply scheme to the VWSC was, by no means, the&#13;
end of the process of providing efficient water services.&#13;
In fact, the existing situation in Jharkhand â&#128;&#147; of the&#13;
long-term absence of PRIs and presence of left-wing&#13;
extremism â&#128;&#147; called for a far-sighted approach and&#13;
adoption of innovative processes to ensure peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
participation in providing efficient water services to&#13;
rural households. The State Water and Sanitation&#13;
Mission (SWSM) had excellent technical capabilities for&#13;
creating the water supply infrastructure. Additionally,            Bank account and pass book in the name of the Water&#13;

   Box 6.2: Case Study of Bhelkhera Village,&#13;
   Koderma District, Jharkhand&#13;
&#13;
   Bhelkhera is a tiny village with a population of 550&#13;
   people. This village was adopted by the Damodar&#13;
   Valley Corporation as a part of its corporate social&#13;
   responsibility initiative to provide sustainable water&#13;
   services to residents. PRADHANâ&#128;&#153;s services were&#13;
   engaged to involve the community in decision&#13;
   making prior to and during the O&amp;M period of&#13;
   the water supply project. PRADHAN created&#13;
                                                                        Bhelkhera Water User Committee pass book&#13;
   womenâ&#128;&#153;s self-help groups (SHGs) which were&#13;
   provided training on various aspects of community&#13;
                                                                        A community-based water supply programme for&#13;
   participation and made aware of the benefits&#13;
                                                                        20 villages has been rolled out through a tripartite&#13;
   arising from collective responsibility. By virtue&#13;
                                                                        partnership among the Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
   of the excellent understanding on community&#13;
                                                                        Department, GoK; PRADHAN for facilitating field-&#13;
   participation developed by SHG members, some&#13;
                                                                        level implementation; and UNICEF for providing&#13;
   also became part of the Gram Vikas Samiti to                         support in field-level coordination, monitoring and&#13;
   ensure secure and sustainable water services in                      reporting. PRADHANâ&#128;&#153;s primary role is mobilising&#13;
   the village. The surface-based water supply project                  local communities and providing technical support&#13;
   was implemented by the Gram Vikas Samiti (GVS)                       at the grassroots level. Accordingly, it forms SHGs in&#13;
   with technical support from PRADHAN and financial                    each village and develops their capacity to participate&#13;
   support from Damodar Valley Corporation at a cost                    in community programmes. Women play a central&#13;
   of `11 lakh. Prior to the initiation of the project,                 role in the entire process and come forward to assist&#13;
   GVS members made an exposure visit to a village                      the VWSCs in regular operations of water supply&#13;
   in Odisha where PRADHAN was implementing a                           schemes. Additional stakeholders have also been&#13;
   similar project.                                                     engaged to improve the efficiency of water service&#13;
   The GVS has been providing O&amp;M services since&#13;
                                                                        delivery as shown in Table 6.1.&#13;
   2009; it supplies water twice every day and has&#13;
   achieved 100 per cent coverage. Each household in&#13;
   the village pays `40 per month (when the scheme&#13;
   is operated using grid-electricity) and `80 per&#13;
   month (when the scheme is operated using diesel).&#13;
   GVS members inform the villagers about the days&#13;
   on which the scheme is to be operated on diesel.&#13;
   Daily piped water supply to the households has&#13;
   enabled women and children to enjoy better health&#13;
   and also provided an opportunity to households to&#13;
   invest more time on farm work. This has increased&#13;
   their income levels significantly. The health and&#13;
   economic benefits have been so significant that&#13;
   one woman in the village remarked that they would&#13;
   never let the scheme fail.                                           Piped water supply tap in one of the households in&#13;

GoJ has made excellent progress in the formation                                   Realising that women are responsible for water for&#13;

PRIs were not held in the state for over 32 years, the                             easy access to water, GoJ evolved measures to enable&#13;
lack of experienced local leadership and absence of                                women to be the flag bearers of VWSCs. These&#13;
government representatives in VWSCs were causes for                                included mandating 50 per cent women membership&#13;

Financial Incentives for VWSCs&#13;
Ongoing and efficient O&amp;M was an important&#13;
issue in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the&#13;
benefits of RWSSs. The SWSM understands that&#13;
typically successful projects are those in which the&#13;
rural populace regularly pays tariffs and which are run&#13;
by financially self-sustaining water supply institutions.               Water User Committee members at Charadih Gram&#13;
The VWSCs have been able to successfully generate                       Panchayat Multi-Village Scheme (left to right: Block&#13;
revenues through efficient tariff collection. The                       Coordinator, Cluster Coordinator and Vice-President)&#13;
tariff collection ranges from `35,000 (Vrindavanpur&#13;
village with 120 households) to `10 lakh (Nuamundi                      up 80 percent of O&amp;M of rural pipe water supply&#13;

aware that services which rely on the users to finance                  to get separate household connections for drinking&#13;
ongoing running costs will only be sustainable if the                   water or was coping through illegal connections for&#13;
willingness of users to pay is sustained. To achieve this,              both water and electricity.&#13;
transparency and accountability in the functioning&#13;
of VWSCs is essential. Additionally, to sustain usersâ&#128;&#153;                  From August 1, 2011, a separate service category was&#13;

Background                                                              due to the failure of a majority of the bore wells.&#13;
MVWSSs are being established across the country,&#13;
to provide complete water supply coverage to rural                      In 2005, GoK started implementing the Mamdapur&#13;
areas despite local water scarcity and increasing                       MVWSS under the Jal Nirmal project with assistance&#13;
contamination of sources. In such circumstances,                        from the World Bank.&#13;
it becomes necessary to make use of distant water&#13;
sources. The Mamdapur MVWSS in Karnataka is one                         As with any MVWSS, the Mamdapur scheme consists&#13;
such scheme that caters to more than nine villages in                   of two facilities: a common facility and an in-village&#13;
Belgaum district with the water being sourced from                      facility. The common facility is used to source water&#13;
Ghataprabha River. The MVWSS replaced an earlier                        from Ghataprabha River and supply treated water&#13;
system that sourced groundwater from either bore wells                  to the overhead tank in each of the villages. The&#13;
or open wells. Many of the villages supplied by the                     in-village facility, which consists of the overhead&#13;
groundwater-based system experienced water scarcity                     tank and the distribution network, is used to supply&#13;

VWSC operating the in-village facility. The project&#13;
was commissioned in March 2009 and O&amp;M of&#13;
the common facility was performed by the district&#13;
support unit of the Karnataka Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Agency (KRWSSA) while O&amp;M of&#13;
the in-village facility was carried out by respective&#13;
village-level committees. However, during 2009,&#13;
the KRWSSA invited bids from private players to&#13;
undertake O&amp;M of the common facility of the&#13;
Mamdapur MVWSS for a period of three years.&#13;
Bangalore-based Niketan Engineering and Projects&#13;
Private Limited was selected as the O&amp;M contractor&#13;
which started providing services from April 2010.&#13;

&amp;#12;Taking on New Challenges | A Compendium of Good Practices in Rural Water Supply Schemes&#13;
&#13;
          The provision of a 24x7 metered water supply system&#13;
          service in RWSSs in Punjab has ensured sustainability&#13;
          due to the service providerâ&#128;&#153;s ability to provide&#13;
          good quality water supply at a convenient time to&#13;
          consumers, ensuring inclusiveness and equity in&#13;
          water supply and fairness in pricing.&#13;

water supply schemes. The service standards vary with                  the resultant benefits of reducing non-revenue water.&#13;
a resulting impact on revenue collections and, thereby,&#13;
on the sustainability of the schemes. In progressive                   By May 2013, 15 villages in Punjab had round-the-&#13;
states such as Punjab, villagersâ&#128;&#153; expectations from                    clock (24x7) metered water supply. These villages are&#13;
RWSSs have veered towards demanding high                               Singhpura, Sitabgarh, Bhajauli, Dau Majra, Jeouli&#13;
service standards including provision of round-the-                    and Fatehgarh in Mohali district, Chitmali, Paprala,&#13;

All 24x7 water connections are metered. Monthly                 sustainable. One reason for this is that DWSS has&#13;
meter readings are taken by the operator (and                   allowed water tariffs to be determined by VWSCs to&#13;
the cashier) in the presence of the consumer.                   recover the systemâ&#128;&#153;s O&amp;M costs in full. Volumetric&#13;

correctness of the meter reading. Collection of                 electricity charges for pumping water, as well as for&#13;
water bills is done jointly by the pump operator and            minor repairs and maintenance. Committees are&#13;
cashier. In case of problems with the meter during              authorised to revise their water tariffs depending on&#13;
use, an average bill of the previous three monthsâ&#128;&#153; use          their actual expenditures. About 90 per cent of the&#13;

               Using technology, the Punjab government has&#13;
               started two good governance initiativesâ&#128;&#148;an online&#13;
               web-enabled centralised complaint redressal&#13;
               system and a proactive feedback mechanism and&#13;
               computerised billing systemâ&#128;&#148;to enhance water&#13;
               supply services&#13;
&#13;
Background                                                              telephone, e-mail and SMS and can monitor&#13;
GPs in Punjab have been at the forefront of taking                      complaints directly. The time that should normally&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of RWSSs for the last decade                     be taken to address some typical complaints is spelt&#13;
or so. Over the years, the GPs have been able to                        out and if a complaint is not rectified within this&#13;
develop capabilities to effectively address not only                    period, it is forwarded to a senior officer. Complaints&#13;
technical but also managerial, social, financial and                    are not closed until the customer is satisfied. The&#13;
institutional issues to provide reliable water services to              water supply service providers now make every effort&#13;
the population. However, there have been instances                      to provide water supply service to consumers with&#13;
of poor service delivery which have been a result of                    minimum breakdowns and also enable them to&#13;
certain other limiting factors at the GP level. These                   respond and take corrective measures.&#13;
include, but are not limited to, the GPâ&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
carry out repairs within a short period, schedule the                   Why SNKs?&#13;
supply period that is convenient to the community,                      Since a large number of RWSSs are operated in remote&#13;
and become accessible to the consumers at all time.                     areas in Punjab, the DWSS was finding it difficult&#13;
The Government of Punjab recognised these factors                       to monitor their day-to-day working including staff&#13;
and initiated two important good governance                             performance, time taken to rectify defects, the quality&#13;
initiatives at the state level: the Shikayat Nivaran                    of water supplied and adherence to supply schedules.&#13;
Kendra (an online web-enabled centralised complaint                     Additionally, the villagers were facing problems&#13;
redressal system) and tele-calling (a proactive feedback                in accessing GP offices to register complaints and&#13;
mechanism and computerised billing system). The                         ensure that the complaints were attended to on a&#13;
Secretary, DWSS, Government of Punjab, reviews                          regular basis. This situation resulted in villagers losing&#13;
the progress on these initiatives on a regular basis.                   confidence in the GPâ&#128;&#153;s ability to provide water supply&#13;
This enables the administration to initiate remedial                    services. Hence a, complaint redressal system, the&#13;
measures to address common problems to avoid their                      SNK, was established with the following objectives:&#13;

The Sanoor GP is not one to rest on its laurels.                 The Sanoor Swajaladhara Yojana has clearly shown&#13;

house tax and water bills to those who implemented               that do not call for huge investments but require a&#13;

            Taking on new challenges : a compendium of
            good practices in rural water supply schemes
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Provision of safe drinking water is a
            basic necessity and has been a major topic for key political
            discourses in the country over the last decade. The
            Government of India has been focusing on safe drinking water
            since 1972-73 when it introduced the Accelerated Rural Water
            Supply Program (ARWSP) to assist States and Union
            Territories to accelerate the coverage of drinking water in
            the country. Despite increased outlays since then, access to
            safe drinking water in India remains a challenge. Apart from
            access, water quality and sustainability of resources (water
            points and infrastructure developed) are issues of major
            concern. The National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP),
            which is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments
            by providing technical and financial assistance, is looking
            at rural drinking water from a holistic viewpoint. The
            Ministry has shifted its focus from hand pumps to piped
            water supply systems with the aim of providing monitored
            clean water and is focusing on those States which have low
            levels of piped water supply. The Water and Sanitation
            Program has compiled an excellent collection of success
            stories and best practices from the States of Kerala,
            Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Punjab and
            Uttarakhand which address these key constraints. Some of
            these success stories, such as the Asoga village
            intervention in Karnataka which showcases a unique demand
            driven approach to facilitate participatory decision making
            leading to community ownership, the Bidholi piped water
            supply scheme in Uttarakhand which manages and recovers 100
            per cent operation and maintenance costs from the community,
            the Shikayat Nivaran Kendra experiment in Punjab which uses
            information technology for online web enabled centralised
            complaint redressal and the Water and Sanitation Management
            Organisation experiment in Gujarat where the registered body
            acts as a facilitator in developing water and sanitation
            facilities owned and managed by communities, are all
            outstanding examples of how to address various challenges
            and shortcomings the program is facing.
