        <abstracts>
            If privatizing network industries is to
            bring lasting public benefits, governments should also
            attempt to introduce competition. The scope for such
            competition is growing with increasing deregulation and
            technological innovation. As technology continues to
            improve, the use of "smart
            markets"--computer-assisted auction systems to clear
            competitive but complex markets--is likely to become
            feasible for an ever-expanding group of products and
            countries. This Note outlines the opportunities for
            introducing network competition--competition for the market,
            competition over existing networks, and competition among
            networks. It briefly considers in each case whether it will
            become easier or more complicated. It looks at how these
            opportunities could be applied in different networks. And it
            concludes with some basic guidelines for introducing
            competition: 1) the more complex the network and the lower
            the sunk cost, the more value there is likely to be in
            introducing competition from other networks. 2) Where
            technical change is rapid, defining the bonds of natural
            monopoly will be more difficult and the dynamic benefits of
            competition will be large. 3) Where government capacity to
            be benevolently and efficiently recognize natural monopoly
            and establish barriers to entry is weak, entry probably
            should not be limited by policy.
