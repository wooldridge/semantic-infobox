The Board of Directors is pleased to report that fiscal 1999 was a landmark year for MIGA.&#13;
In the previous fiscal year, the question of a general capital increase for MIGA was put to a&#13;
vote by the Council of Governors. On April 5, 1999, the voting period closed with a strong&#13;
vote in favor of the capital increase.&#13;
During the year the guarantees portfolio continued to grow, and for the first time MIGA&#13;
issued guarantees amounting to more than $1 billion in a single year. MIGA also registered&#13;
its first claim, which is being processed. Finally, technical assistance activities continued to&#13;
grow, including expanded field activities in Africa.&#13;

Fiscal 1999 (uly 1, 1998 toJune 30,1999)&#13;
was a record-breaking year for MIGA. On&#13;
April 5, 1999 MIGA's Council of Governors&#13;
approved a doubling of its capital resources&#13;
to $2 billion.&#13;
For the first time, MIGA issued guaran-&#13;
tees exceeding $ 1 billion in a single year,&#13;
reaching a total of $ 1.3 billion. This repre-&#13;
sents 72 contracts in 29 developing coun-&#13;
tries, bringing the total amount of foreign&#13;
direct investment (FDI) facilitated by MIGA&#13;
since its inception in 1988 to an estimated&#13;
$30.4 billion.&#13;
During the year MIGA expanded its&#13;
underwriting capacity through new and&#13;
revised treaty reinsurance agreements (with&#13;
XL Insurance Limited of Bermuda and ACE&#13;
Bermuda Insurance Limited). These agree-&#13;
ments will allow for up to $620 million of coverage to be issued per country, and up to&#13;
$200 million per project. In addition, MIGA concluded memoranda of understanding with&#13;
two national insurers; EID/MITI of Japan and EFIC of Australia.&#13;

orientation, and partnerships, which were&#13;
elaborated on in a Strategic Focus Paper.&#13;

investment against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil distur-&#13;
bance. The expropriation coverage protects the investment against actions by either&#13;
government against the project enterprise in either Chile or Argentina.&#13;
The project, part of an integrated energy project, will transmit natural gas from Argen-&#13;
tina to Chile through the construction and operation of the 641 kilometer GasPacifico&#13;
pipeline. In Chile all users of hydrocarbon fuels in Region VIII will benefit from reliable&#13;
supplies of natural gas. The use of environmentally clean fuel will replace high-sulfur fuel&#13;
oil, coal, and firewood, thus alleviating pollution and deforestation. Training will be&#13;
provided for construction and inspection, safety, and technical and professional programs.&#13;
The project will generate more than $835 million in tax revenues for the two countries&#13;
and substantial annual exports from Argentina. Goods and services totaling approxi-&#13;

CONCLUSION&#13;
This fiscal year was marked by several posi-&#13;
tive changes in MIGA's investment market-&#13;
ing services and technical assistance activi-&#13;
ties. The external evaluation conducted in&#13;
fiscal 1 998 positioned the department to&#13;
implement new products and services to pro-&#13;
vide more in-depth capacity-building assis-&#13;
tance to clients, based on sharper diagnostic&#13;
work through the use of the new assessment&#13;
framework. The addition of new staff with&#13;
experience in managing and operating in-&#13;
vestment promotion agencies, the secondment&#13;
of a senior executive from a world class in-&#13;
vestment promotion agency in Europe, and&#13;
a new information products and services pro-&#13;
gram manager were significant enhance-&#13;
ments to in-house knowledge and expertise&#13;
to better serve our clients.&#13;
Recognition of the high quality of the prod-&#13;
ucts and services of MIGA's investment mar-&#13;
keting come in many forms. Donor agencies&#13;
were supportive of capacity-building and in-&#13;
formation dissemination tools through fund-&#13;
ing for ongoing work and special initiatives.&#13;
Traditional clients, such as investment pro-&#13;
motion agencies and sectoral ministries, ex-&#13;
pressed a high degree of satisfaction with&#13;
the department's new tools and techniques&#13;
for attracting foreign direct investment. More-&#13;
over, for some countries a new client base&#13;
began to emerge in the form of subnational&#13;
entities such as municipalities and states that,&#13;
with the devolution of responsibilities from&#13;
the national to local governments, are now&#13;
taking on a larger role in formulating eco-&#13;
nomic development strategies targeting for-&#13;
eign direct investment as a key component.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a member&#13;
of the World Bank Group which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall&#13;
development objectives of the other World Bank institutions. MIGA is designed to help developing&#13;
countries attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated&#13;
public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks&#13;
and a program of advisory services and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to&#13;
attract and retain foreign direct investment.&#13;
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Accounting Standards&#13;
and with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The policy adopted is that&#13;
considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements&#13;
and to the practices of other international insurance entities.&#13;
Use of Estimates&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting Standards and&#13;
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make esti-&#13;
mates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results&#13;
could differ from those estimates. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is provided&#13;
to assist readers in the interpretation of these financial statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the purpose of&#13;
summarizing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its&#13;
members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of all its&#13;
members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its members'&#13;
currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency environment. As such,&#13;
MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency with assets in the same&#13;
currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to match&#13;
the currencies underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The purpose of&#13;
these conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur through operations. Otherwise,&#13;
MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for small amounts required to meet certain&#13;
operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and expenses&#13;
are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.&#13;
Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA&#13;
shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) in terms of&#13;
United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to&#13;
$1.082 for one SDR.&#13;
Investments&#13;
As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to commercial&#13;
banks and to obtain higher returns, MIGA invests in government and agency obligations and time&#13;
deposits according to its credit risk and maturity policies. Government and agency obligations&#13;
include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally&#13;
guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies or&#13;
by multilateral organizations.&#13;
During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, MIGA began investing in securities classified as available-&#13;
for-sale in accordance with the new investment guidelines approved by the Board of Directors on&#13;
November 12, 1998.&#13;
Investments classified as available-for-sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to&#13;
maturity as part of asset/liability management or in response to other factors, are carried at fair&#13;
value with any changes in fair value reported in the Balance Sheet as a component of other compre-&#13;
hensive income. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed and ceded&#13;
is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commitment fees, which&#13;
are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee capacity for future use,&#13;
is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for potential losses, net of future premiums, inherent in guarantee&#13;
operations based upon an estimation of the net present value of future premium income as com-&#13;
pared to the net present value of future losses related to guarantee operations. MIGA has not&#13;
incurred any losses to date, although it has received its first claim on March 19, 1999 (see Note E).&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA has computed expected future losses by reference to (i) the loss experiences of&#13;
other insurers engaged in similar underwriting, (ii) the composition and volume of outstanding&#13;
guarantee contracts, and (iii) the worldwide economic and political environment. This reserve is&#13;
available to absorb future losses related to outstanding guarantees and is increased by provisions&#13;
charged to expense and decreased by claims settlements.&#13;
The level of provision is based upon management's evaluation of potential losses, net of future&#13;
premiums, that may result from (i) risks that are inherent, but unidentifiable at the time of reporting,&#13;
(ii) unusually large concentrations of exposure to individual risks, countries or guarantee contracts,&#13;
and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGA's expected recovery rates. Sufficient claims reserves are&#13;
established at the end of each year to cover all of the estimated future losses arising from contracts&#13;
outstanding at that time on a net present value basis; future provisions are then established to reflect&#13;
changes in MIGA's outstanding portfolio.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
In the event of a formal filing of claim by an investor, and upon receipt of full evidence of the&#13;
occurrence of the covered risk, MIGA normally has between two months and six months to deter-&#13;
mine its liability under the contract, depending upon the type of coverage and contract terms, and&#13;
60 days thereafter to pay the claim.&#13;

The MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a pro-&#13;
vision that the authorized capital stock shall automatically increase on the admission of a new&#13;
member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide the shares to be&#13;
subscribed by such member. In FY99, the initial authorized capital stock increased to 101,640&#13;
shares. The Convention further states that 10 percent of the members' initial subscription be paid in&#13;
cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up to a&#13;
quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional 10 percent of the initial subscription&#13;
shall be paid in the form of nonnegotiable, noninterest bearing promissory notes. The notes are&#13;
denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations.&#13;
The remaining 80 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a resolution increasing the authorized&#13;
capital stock of MIGA by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period&#13;
ending March 28, 2002. Of the additional capital, 17.65 percent is to be paid in cash, in freely usable&#13;
currency. The remaining 82.35 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
At June 30, 1999, MIGA's authorized capital stock comprised 180,199 shares of which 103,653&#13;
(99,682 - June 30, 1998) shares had been subscribed. Each share has a par value of SDR 10,000,&#13;
valued at the rate of $1.082 per SDR. Of the subscribed capital, $223,062,000 ($214,980,000 -&#13;
June 30, 1998) has been paid in; $731,000 (731,000 - June 30, 1998) is due and the remaining&#13;
$897,732,000 (862,848,000 -June 30, 1998) is subject to call. Of the amounts paid in, at June&#13;
30, 1999, $102,237,000 ($99,775,000 - June 30, 1998) is in the form of nonnegotiable,&#13;
noninterest bearing demand obligations (promissory notes). A summary of MIGA's capital stock at&#13;
June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998 is as follows:&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTE C: GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantee Program. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncommercial&#13;
risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in developing member&#13;
countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different categories of risk:&#13;
currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency trans-&#13;
fer protects the investor from inconvertibility of local currency returns and proceeds from the liquida-&#13;
tion of the investment project into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Expropria-&#13;
tion protects the investor against partial or total loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by&#13;
the host government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured&#13;
investment. War and civil disturbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the&#13;
destruction or disappearance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil&#13;
disturbance in the host country. Breach of contract protects the investor against the impossibility to&#13;
obtain or to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the&#13;
host government. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the four types of coverage.&#13;
MIGA guarantees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated unilaterally by&#13;
the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance. Premium rates applicable&#13;
to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims under a guarantee may not&#13;
exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee.&#13;
As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate&#13;
amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGA's&#13;
unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA&#13;
through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accordingly, at June 30,&#13;
1999, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may not exceed $5,863,415,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees out-&#13;
standing at June 30, 1999 totaled $3,675,475,000 ($2,861,793,000 -June 30, 1998). The&#13;
maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum exposure to insurance claims, which&#13;
includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently at risk. AtJune 30,&#13;
1999, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insurance claims exclusive of standby coverage is&#13;
$1,945,571,000 ($1,678,540,000 -June 30, 1998). At June 30, 1999, approximately 50 per-&#13;
cent of the contingent liability represents guarantees issued that will expire on or after June 30,&#13;
2009.&#13;
As of June 30,1999, additional guarantee capacity amounting to $105,459,000 has been committed&#13;
($10,000,000 -June 30, 1998).&#13;
Claim Activity. On March 19, 1999, MIGA received its first claim since inception, an expropriation&#13;
claim related to a power project in Indonesia. MIGA has asked for additional evidence supporting&#13;
the claim. Once sufficient evidence of the claim is received, MIGA has six months to determine its&#13;
liability under the contract and 60 days thereafter to pay the claim. MIGA's gross liability under the&#13;
contract is $15,000,000 of which 70 percent is reinsured.&#13;
NOTE D: REINSURANCE&#13;
Although MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity&#13;
and to protect portions of its insurance portfolio, it remains responsible to the insured client for the&#13;
entire amount of the insurance contract. Of the 3,675,475,000 outstanding contingent liability&#13;
(gross exposure) as at June 30, 1999 ($2,861,793,000 - June 30, 1998), $1,067,933,000 was&#13;
MIGA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  71&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
ceded through contracts of reinsurance ($636,330,000 - June 30, 1998). Net exposure amounted&#13;
to $2,607,542,000 as at June 30, 1999 ($2,225,463,000 - June 30, 1998).&#13;
MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsurance. As of&#13;
June 30, 1999, total insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official investment insurers, amounted&#13;
to $110,140,000 ($113,481,000 -June 30, 1998).&#13;
Estimated reinsurance recoverables have been determined based upon a review of the selected&#13;
contracts in force and other available information.&#13;
Premiums relating to direct, assumed, and ceded contracts for the fiscal years ended June 30,1999&#13;
and June 30, 1998 were as follows (in thousands of US dollars):&#13;

NOTE E: RESERVE FOR CLAIMS&#13;
MIGA's gross reserve for claims as of June 30, 1999 amounted to $340,000,000 ($255,100,000 -&#13;
June 30, 1998).&#13;
An analysis of the changes to the gross reserve for claims for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999&#13;
and June 30, 1998 appears in the following page:&#13;

NOTE F: STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (Plan) covering substantially all of&#13;
MIGA's staff. The Plan also covers substantially all the staff of IBRD and IFC. Under the Plan, benefits&#13;
are based on the years of contributory service and the highest three-year average of pensionable&#13;
remuneration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable&#13;
remuneration, and the World Bank Group contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined&#13;
cost of future Plan benefits. The actuarial present values of Plan obligations throughout the fiscal&#13;
72 MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 1999&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's actuary. MIGA's total contribu-&#13;
tion to the plan is based upon the aggregate funding method. All contributions to the Plan and all&#13;
other assets and income held for the purposes of the Plan are held seporately from the other assets&#13;
and income of the World Bank Group and can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the&#13;
Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. Plan assets&#13;
consists primarily of equity and fixed income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and&#13;
other investments.&#13;
Net periodic pension income allocated to MIGA and included in income from Staff Retirement Plan&#13;
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 was $3,740,000 ($2,698,000 - June 30, 19981.&#13;
NOTE G: OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
IBRD provides other postretirement benefits for eligible active and retired World Bank Group staff,&#13;
including MIGA. These benefits can be grouped under two major types, i.e. health care and life&#13;
insurance benefit and the pensions administered outside of the Staff Retirement Plan (discussed in&#13;
Note F). IBRD has designated assets to fund these liabilities.&#13;
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1 998, the World Bank Group reviewed the status of the&#13;
postretirement benefits and determined that the net assets and liabilities did not qualify for off-balance-&#13;
sheet accounting. Consequently, at June 30, 1998, the assets and liabilities were recorded on&#13;
IBRD's balance sheet.&#13;
At June 30, 1999, MIGA has included in other assets a prepaid postretirement benefits cost of&#13;
$324,000 ($499,000 -June 30, 1998) relating to its share of the postretirement benefits net assets.&#13;
Expense resulting from the decrease in MIGA's share of these net assets for the fiscal year ended&#13;
June 30, 1999 was $174,000 ($nil - June 30, 1998).&#13;
NOTE H: SERVICE AND SUPPORT FEE&#13;
The IBRD charges MIGA an annual Service and Support Fee, which for the fiscal year ending&#13;
June 30, 1999, amounted to $860,000 ($740,000 - June 30, 1998).&#13;
NOTE 1: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME&#13;
During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, MIGA adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting&#13;
Standards ISFAS) No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". SFAS No. 130 defines and estab-&#13;
lishes the standards for reporting comprehensive income. Under SFAS No. 1 30, certain items that&#13;
historically were not recognized in the calculation of net income are now included in the broader&#13;
definition of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income has two major components: net income&#13;
and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income comprises unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on available-for-sale investments and currency translation adjustments.&#13;
NOTE J: ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES&#13;
The estimated fair values of MIGA's cash and nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing demand obligations&#13;
are assumed to approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value of MIGA's investments&#13;
shown in Note B is based on market quotations. The estimated fair values are only indicative of&#13;
individual financial instruments' values and should not be considered an indication of MIGA's fair value.&#13;

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency,&#13;
as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, including the statement of subscription to capital stock and voting&#13;
power and the statement of guarantees outstanding as of June 30, 1999, and the related statements&#13;
of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years&#13;
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements&#13;
based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally&#13;
accepted auditing standards in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the&#13;
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting&#13;
principles used and significant estimotes made by management, as well as evaluating the overall&#13;
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our&#13;
opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position&#13;
of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency as of June 30, 1999 and 1998 and the results of&#13;
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with International Accounting&#13;
Standards and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.&#13;
