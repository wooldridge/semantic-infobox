&#13;
      Half a year ago, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic prospects looked uncertain. The global economy was los-&#13;
ing momentum, the expansion in the euro area was grinding to a halt and commodity prices were&#13;
beginning to fall. Yet, while output growth is slowing this year in line with weaker growth in&#13;
Europe and elsewhere, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s latest economy performance has been solid, though aided by favor-&#13;
able oil prices.&#13;
      The economy returned to the pre-crisis peak towards the end of last year, supported by strong&#13;
consumption, as growth held steady at the same rate as in 2010. In 2011, measured in current dollars,&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy was the ninth biggest in the world, compared to the eleventh biggest in 2007. This&#13;
year, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s output might exceed US$2 trillion. Equalizing for prices difference with purchasing&#13;
power parity, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is already the sixth biggest today. The current account looks strong&#13;
thanks to a large surplus in the trade balance, and the Central Bank of Russia added again in 2011 to&#13;
its stock of foreign reserves. Employment returned to pre-crisis levels even earlier than output, and&#13;
wages grew at a solid pace. Inï¬&#130;ation reached its lowest level in two decades. Inequality declined and&#13;
consumption levels of low-income households improved. The ï¬&#129;scal balance returned to a surplus.&#13;
And while average public debt levels in advanced economies exceeded 100 percent of GDP in 2011,&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s public debt was no more than 10 percent of GDP.&#13;
      However, a fair share of the recent accomplishments is tied to high oil prices. Boosted by supply&#13;
constraints rather than strong global demand, the price of Urals crossed US$125/barrel in early March&#13;
2012, the ï¬&#129;rst time since July 2008. High oil prices have translated into strong export receipts, buoyant&#13;
ï¬&#129;scal revenues, and a bullish stock market. Nevertheless, in spite of high oil prices, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
expansion remains subdued. Indeed, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery from the 2008 crisis was slow compared to its&#13;
recovery from the 1998 crisis, as well as compared to the recovery of many other economies in the last&#13;
few years.&#13;
      A closer look at the economic situation reveals a number of weaknesses. The growth of the&#13;
manufacturing industries slowed in the second half of 2011. Fixed investment has started picking up&#13;
only recently, foreign direct investment stays sluggish, and capital outï¬&#130;ows are elevated. The non-oil&#13;
current account deï¬&#129;cit reached a record 13 percent of GDP in 2011, underlying the oil dependence of&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s export sector. The non-oil ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit remained close to 10 percent of GDP, and is projected&#13;
to increase further this year. Inï¬&#130;ation is set to pick up later in the year, as delayed increases in utility&#13;
and gasoline prices kick in and prices pressures increase as enterprises ï¬&#129;nd it more difï¬&#129;cult to ï¬&#129;ll job&#13;
vacancies.&#13;
      Economic policies can help to shore up Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s resilience in a volatile economic environment,&#13;
diversify its economy, and strengthen its growth potential. First, ï¬&#129;scal policy should be used to rebuild&#13;
ï¬&#129;scal buffers while oil prices are high. This would not only help to prepare for the next crisis, but also&#13;
make sure that ï¬&#129;scal policy does not become procyclical as the output gap closes. Furthermore, mone-&#13;
tary policy should continue to focus on low inï¬&#130;ation, and ï¬&#129;nancial policies on strengthening over-&#13;
sight. Finally, removing structural barriers to growth can help to bolster investment and productivity.&#13;
Improving the business environment would go a long way to make the most of the economic beneï¬&#129;ts&#13;
of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s World Trade Organization accession in summer 2012.&#13;

&#13;
Growthâ&#128;&#148;steady even though global recovery stalls&#13;
While the global economy weakened, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance strengthened in the second half of 2011.&#13;
Helped by broad-based growth, including a strong rebound in agriculture, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s output returned to pre-crisis&#13;
levels at the end of 2011, even though ï¬&#129;xed investment lagged behind. The growth momentum carried over to&#13;
2012, supported by a rebound in non-tradable sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     While the global recovery weakened, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth remained resilient and its output&#13;
returned to pre-crisis levels. Strains in ï¬&#129;nancial and sovereign debt markets of the euro area, the&#13;
slowing recovery in the US, the recession in Japan, high commodity prices, and the end of the inven-&#13;
tory cycle and ï¬&#129;scal consolidation dampened global economic activity in 2011. This led to a slow-&#13;
down in the expansion of world trade and industrial production (Figure 1). Yet, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery&#13;
remained on track. While growth moderated from 2010 to 2011 in high-income OECD countries and&#13;
emerging economies outside the EU, growth in 2011 reached 4.3 percent in Russia, unchanged from&#13;
2010.1 As a result, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s output returned to pre-crisis levels towards the end of 2011. However,&#13;
the recovery was slow relative to the recovery from the 1998 crisis, and compared to other econo-&#13;
mies (Box 1 and Box 2).&#13;

     The robust expansion in Russia reï¬&#130;ects a solid performance in the second half of 2011. Growth&#13;
in Russia accelerated from 3.8 percent year-on-year in the ï¬&#129;rst half to 4.8 percent in the second half&#13;
of 2011.2 The upturn beneï¬&#129;ted from the base effect, as growth weakened from the ï¬&#129;rst to the second&#13;
half of 2010. But it also was due to the dynamism of the economy as quarter-on-quarter growth picked&#13;
up from the ï¬&#129;rst half of 2011 to the second half of 2011. As a result, growth in 2011 was 0.3 percent of&#13;
GDP better than expected in September, at the time when the previous Russian Economic Report was&#13;
released (Figure 2). This reï¬&#130;ects in part a larger-than-expected carry-over effect of growth, as growth&#13;
in 2010 was revised upwards from 4.0 to 4.3 percent. And, as we discuss below, domestic demand&#13;
was more robust than expected.&#13;

  Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia). Other emerging economies includes also six countries:&#13;
  Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Turkey, and Mexico.&#13;

&#13;
  second half.&#13;

Consumption, ï¬&#129;xed capital investment and             6&#13;

remained the most important growth driver, as&#13;
companies continued to rebuild their inventories     4&#13;
following the sharp decline in 2009 (Figure 1).      3&#13;
Consumption was the second most important&#13;
factor, as household consumption picked up and       2&#13;
&#13;
the contribution of public consumption turned        1&#13;
positive for the ï¬&#129;rst time since 2009. Private con-&#13;

The larger contributions from inventories and&#13;
consumption were offset by a decline in net exports, mainly due to weaker exports. In 2011, looking&#13;
at growth trends over the quarters shows that consumption instead of inventories became the largest&#13;
growth contributor in the second and third quarters.&#13;

     Fixed capital investment is still recovering from the crisis. Relative to the pre-crisis peak of the&#13;
second quarter of 2008, private consumption recovered the fastest, followed by public consumption&#13;
and exports. While imports contracted the sharpest during the crisis, they recovered strongly and&#13;
were in the third quarter of 2011 close to the pre-crisis level. Fixed capital investment rebounded&#13;
the slowest, and remained 3 percentage points below the pre-crisis level in the third quarter of 2011&#13;
(Figure 4). Overall investment reached 22 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2011, some 4.4 percent&#13;
of GDP below the level in the second quarter of 2008. However, the latest numbers suggest that ï¬&#129;xed&#13;
capital investment is picking up.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Growth in the tradable sector picked up, lifted by a strong rebound in agriculture. A sec-&#13;
toral breakdown shows that, in contrast to previous years, the tradable sector grew faster than the&#13;
non-tradable sector. Prior to the crisis, growth relied heavily on construction, real estate, wholesale&#13;
and retail trade and ï¬&#129;nancial services. These non-tradable sectors underwent sizable adjustments&#13;
during the crisis, and, with the exception of ï¬&#129;nancial services, rebounded in 2010 (Figure 5). In 2011,&#13;
all non-tradable sectors posted positive growth, although growth moderated in some subsectors&#13;
compared to 2010, including wholesale and retail trade and transport and communication. In the&#13;
tradable sector, mineral extraction and manufacturing also took a hit during the 2008/09 crisis as&#13;
global demand for energy and industrial production plummeted. While these two sectors rebounded&#13;
in 2010, agriculture contracted sharply due to a drought, moderating growth in the tradable sector to&#13;
below 5 percent. In 2011, growth in manufacturing and especially mineral extraction moderated, but&#13;
growth in agriculture bounced back strongly due to a bumper crop. As a result, growth in tradable&#13;
sectors increased to 5.9 percent, compared to only 3.6 percent in the non-tradable sectors. The growth&#13;
contribution of mineral extraction and manufacturing declined from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to&#13;
1.1 percent of GDP in 2011, while agriculture improved from -0.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.6 per-&#13;
cent of GDP in 2011 (Figure 6).&#13;

      High-frequency indicators suggest that the growth momentum carried over into early 2012.&#13;
Rosstatâ&#128;&#153;s business conï¬&#129;dence index improved from -6 percent in December 2011 to -2 percent in&#13;
February 2012. The OECD composite leading indicator for Russia also rose in January, and was above&#13;
its long-term average of 100. This indicator also improved for emerging EU countries, but declined&#13;
both in high-income OECD countries and emerging economies outside the EU (Figure 7). Rising oil&#13;
prices and improving global market risk appetite also lifted Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s stock market.&#13;

     The dynamics of the non-tradable sector improved recently relative to the tradable sector. In&#13;
the tradable sector, only agriculture performed strongly, while growth of mineral extraction, and&#13;
especially manufacturing, was noticeably weaker than a year ago (Figure 8). In the non-tradable&#13;
sector, retail trade and construction improved from a year ago. Electricity, gas and water remained&#13;
unchanged, partly due to a mild winter, and commercial freight transport picked up moderately.&#13;
Registrations for the construction of residential apartments turned positive in July 2011 for the ï¬&#129;rst&#13;
time since December 2010 and reached in January 2012 their highest growth rate since December 2007.&#13;
The performance of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s retail sector stands out in international comparisons. Since January 2010,&#13;
retail trade volumes increased 15 percent in Russia, compared to only 11 percent in non-EU emerging&#13;
economies, and declined in emerging EU economies (Figure 9).&#13;

&amp;#12;   Box 1. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery from the 2008 crisis&#13;
&#13;
         While Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s output exceeded the pre-crisis peak in the late 2011, the recovery from the crisis is slow.&#13;
   This is borne out by comparisons with the recovery from the 1998 crisis. For both the 1998 and 2008 crisis, GDP&#13;
   dropped about 10 percentage points from peak to trough. However, GDP took seven quarters to recover to pre-crisis&#13;
   level after the 1998 crisis, yet twice as long after the 2008 crisis. What accounts for the weaker recovery? Looking at&#13;
   GDP components, we find that investment is a key culprit (Figure 10). After 13 quarters, investment was still 20 percent&#13;
   off its pre-crisis peak in the 2008 crisis, while it had recovered to pre-crisis levels in the 1998 crisis. Similarly, after&#13;
   13 quarters, fixed investment was already 10 percent above pre-crisis levels in the 1998 crisis, yet it remained 8 per-&#13;
   centage points below the pre-crisis level in the 2008 crisis. By contrast, consumption held up better in the 2008 crisis&#13;
   than in the 1998 crisis, in part because Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s stronger fiscal position allowed it to respond during the 2008 crisis&#13;
   with counter-cyclical fiscal policy. However, imports also plummeted less and recovered faster in the 2008 crisis. After&#13;
   13 quarters, imports reached their pre-crisis level in the 2008 crisis, while they were still 10 percentage points off the&#13;
   pre-crisis level in the 1998 crisis. In addition to investment and imports, exports also contributed to the weaker recovery.&#13;
   After 13 quarters, exports remained at pre-crisis level in the 2008 crisis, but were about 18 percent above pre-crisis&#13;
   level in the 1998 crisis. The slower rebound from the 2008 crisis compared to the 1998 crisis is perhaps unsurprising.&#13;
   While the 1998 crisis was regional in nature, the 2008 crisis was global, and the world economy experienced a longer&#13;
   and deeper contraction. World growth moderated to only 2.5 percent and rebounded already after one year in the late&#13;
   1990s, but dropped over 6 percent and rebounded only after two years in the late 2000s. In addition, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy&#13;
   had vast spare capacity in the late 1990s, and benefited from a sharper depreciation than during the 2008 crisis.&#13;

         However, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery from the 2008 crisis is also weak compared to other economies. Comparing&#13;
   IMF growth projections from the eve of the 2008 crisis to actual developments suggests that the crisis led to both a&#13;
   downward shift and a flattening of the growth trajectory. Two points are noteworthy. First, the crisis changed growth&#13;
   trajectories for all country groupings shown below (Figure 11). All four groups experienced a downward shift in out-&#13;
   put due to the economic adjustment in 2009. However, the slope of the growth trajectory post-crisis looks roughly&#13;
   unchanged for high-income OECD countries and other emerging economies. By contrast, growth slowed post-crisis&#13;
   in Russia and emerging EU countries, and the gap with the pre-crisis trajectory widened. Nevertheless, the growth&#13;
   trajectory in Russia remains steeper than in high-income OECD countries and emerging EU countries, as Russia&#13;
   still has vast potential to close the productivity gap with the high-income economies through capital accumulation,&#13;
   skill development, and technology absorption. Second, growth moderation was starker for Russia than for other&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 1. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery from the 2008 crisis (continued)&#13;
countries. In fact, among the 37 countries investigated here, Russia was the furthest off the pre-crisis trajectory in&#13;
2011. This is related to three factors. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy was overheating in the run-up to the crisis, making the pre-&#13;
crisis growth trajectory unsustainable. In addition, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s downturn during the crisis was especially severe, as the&#13;
economy faced three shocks. Like, for example, the emerging EU countries, Russia faced a sharp decline in credit&#13;
and trade flows. But Russia also was hit by a plunge in oil prices. Finally, in the post-crisis period, notwithstanding&#13;
high oil prices, investment remained weak due to capital outflows, high global risk aversion, and renewed attention&#13;
to the quality of the investment climate.&#13;

Box 2. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s income convergence and labor productivity&#13;
&#13;
     Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s convergence to income levels of the high-income countries has slowed since the crisis. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s income&#13;
level rose rapidly from 30 percent in 2003 to 54 percent of the high-income OECD level in 2008 (Figure 12). Yet, at&#13;
55 percent, it was only moderately improved in 2011 compared to 2008. The slowdown in convergence is linked to&#13;
the drop in labor productivity. From 2003 to 2008, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP per hour worked rose rapidly, fuelling a catch-up in&#13;
living standards with advanced economies. From 2008 to 2010, labor productivity fell, while it continued to rise in the&#13;
emerging EU countries and high-income OECD countries. In 2010, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s labor productivity was still only 43 per-&#13;
cent of the level of high-income OECD countries, and 74 percent of the level of emerging EU countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;Balance of payments â&#128;&#148; large current account surplus,&#13;
large capital outï¬&#130;ows&#13;
The current account performed well in 2011, supported by high oil prices. This allowed the Central Bank of&#13;
Russia to add to its foreign reserves, even though net capital outï¬&#130;ows increased towards the end of the year. The&#13;
real depreciation of the exchange rate in the second half of 2011 reversed in early 2012 with the improvement in&#13;
global market sentiment.&#13;
&#13;
     The external current account beneï¬&#129;ted from high oil prices in 2011 but remains vulner-&#13;
able to oil price shocks. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s trade balance remains largely a function of oil prices (Figure 13).&#13;
The strong rise in oil prices in 2011 more than offset the modest decrease in oil export volumes&#13;
and helped to improve the trade balance, which in turn strengthened Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s current account.&#13;
In addition, monthly year-on-year import growth slowed from over 40 percent in nominal dollar&#13;
value in mid-2011 to around 20 percent by end-2011, contributing to the strength of the current&#13;
account (Figure 15). The current account surplus rose to US$101 billion in 2011 from US$70 bil-&#13;
lion in 2010 (Table 1). The current account surplus is just over half the size of the trade surplus,&#13;
as Russia ran large deï¬&#129;cits in services and investment income, where payments abroad are about&#13;
twice the amount of payments received. At the same time, the non-oil current account deï¬&#129;cit further&#13;
increased to US$240 billion in 2011 (13 percent of GDP) from US$184 billion in 2010 (12.4 percent&#13;
of GDP), underlying the vulnerability of the current account to oil price shocks (Figure 14). In 2011,&#13;
non-energy exports declined to less than 35 percent of total goods exports, down from over 37 per-&#13;
cent in 2009 (Figure 16).&#13;

     The capital account deteriorated considerably in 2011, as uncertainty about the global recov-&#13;
ery and concerns over the euro area led to a ï¬&#130;ight to safety. According to preliminary estimates,&#13;
the capital account deï¬&#129;cit amounted to US$75 billion in 2011 compared to US$26 billion in 2010.&#13;
Net foreign direct investment ï¬&#130;ows reached -0.6 percent of GDP in the ï¬&#129;rst nine month of 2011, the&#13;
same level as for the full year in 2010 and 2009, and far below the level of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007.&#13;
Almost half of the capital account deï¬&#129;cit was registered in the last quarter of 2011. In spite of high&#13;
oil prices and robust growth, net capital outï¬&#130;ows intensiï¬&#129;ed towards the end of the year. The bulk&#13;
of the capital ï¬&#130;ows came from the private sector. According to preliminary CBR estimates, net capi-&#13;
tal outï¬&#130;ows from the private sector amounted to US$84.2 billion in 2011, compared to US$ 33.6 bil-&#13;
lion in 2010 (Table 2). Both banks and non-ï¬&#129;nancial corporations increased their net foreign asset&#13;
position in 2011. In the last quarter, net capital outï¬&#130;ows amounted to US$7.5 billion for banks and&#13;
US$30.0 billion for non-ï¬&#129;nancial corporations, which was almost half of the total outï¬&#130;ows for the&#13;
year (Figure 17).&#13;
     What accounts for the increase in net capital outï¬&#130;ows? Investorsâ&#128;&#153; concerns about the quality of&#13;
the investment climate and domestic political uncertainty during the election cycle are likely to have&#13;
affected capital ï¬&#130;ows. However, the rise in net capital outï¬&#130;ows in the second half of 2011 was mainly&#13;
a response to worries about an escalation of the euro area debt crisis and a slowdown in the global&#13;
recovery. A ï¬&#130;ight to safety was visible across the main emerging markets in the second half of 2011.&#13;
Due to the size and liquidity of its market, changes in global market sentiment tend to affect Russia&#13;
more than smaller emerging markets. At the same time, it is worth noting that net capital outï¬&#130;ows&#13;
remained far below the peak in 2008, when capital outï¬&#130;ows reached US$134 billion, especially when&#13;
measured in percent of GDP. In addition, as Russia moves towards a ï¬&#130;exible exchange rate strategy,&#13;
net capital outï¬&#130;ows are a typical counterpart of current account surpluses. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s sales of goods and&#13;
services abroad translate into the acquisition of foreign assets.&#13;

     The ruble depreciated in late 2011 in view of a rise in net capital outï¬&#130;ows but appreciated&#13;
again as global market sentiment improved in early 2012. Higher oil prices led to a real appreciation&#13;
of the ruble up to July 2011. The real effective exchange rate weakened with the shift in global market&#13;
sentiment in the third quarter of 2011, but had recouped its losses by end-February 2012. Relative to&#13;
January 2008, the ruble gained 12 percent, similar to the Chinese renminbi and the South African rand.&#13;
This compares to losses of about 10 percent of the Polish zloty and the Indian rupee and 15 percent&#13;
of the Turkish lira.&#13;

      In spite of the large net capital outï¬&#130;ows, the CBR accumulated additional reserves thanks&#13;
to the high current account surplus. The CBR added some US$12 billion to its reserves, about one&#13;
third of the amount in 2010. At the end of 2011, the CBRâ&#128;&#153;s foreign exchange reserves were just under&#13;
US$500 billion, or about 28 percent of GDP. While this was some US$25 billion below the level in the&#13;
second quarter of 2011, it represented an increase of about US$115 billion from the trough during the&#13;
crisis in the ï¬&#129;rst quarter of 2009.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Despite some deleveraging in the third quarter of 2011, ofï¬&#129;cial debt statistics show an&#13;
increase in the overall debt exposure of the corporate sector in end-2011. Difï¬&#129;cult market condi-&#13;
tions limited the rollover capacity of banks and nonï¬&#129;nancial corporations, and they deleveraged&#13;
their balance sheets during the third quarter of 2011. However, according to the CBR preliminary&#13;
debt statistics, the outstanding external debt of the corporate sector increased above the level of&#13;
end-June 2011 to US$494 billion by end-December 2011 (Table 3). In the second half of 2011, external&#13;
liabilities increased for banks, but decreased for nonï¬&#129;nancial corporations. Furthermore, in spite of&#13;
volatile global market conditions, both banks and non-ï¬&#129;nancial corporations increased their long-&#13;
term external ï¬&#129;nancing by end-September 2011 (Table 4), while the share of outstanding short-term&#13;
debt remained stable.&#13;

Labor Markets and Poverty â&#128;&#148; falling unemployment, rising wages, and&#13;
falling inequality and stable poverty in spite of high food inï¬&#130;ation&#13;
The labor market tightened, although seasonal effects slowed some improvements in the second half of 2011.&#13;
Employment rose above pre-crisis level, and unemployment dropped to pre-crisis levels in about half of the&#13;
regions. Real wages increased, and real consumption rose, especially for poorer households. This lowered inequal-&#13;
ity, even though the gains in income of poor people were offset through price increases of food and other neces-&#13;
sities, leaving poverty rates broadly unchanged.&#13;
&#13;
      Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s labor market improved in 2011, as the main outcomes gradually reached the pre-crisis&#13;
levels. Employment and labor force participation rates were steadily growing prior to the economic&#13;
crisis (Figure 19). The unemployment rate fell from 10.6 percent in 2000 to 6.1 percent in 2007 and&#13;
6.3 percent in 2008. The crisis abruptly hit the economy in the fall of 2008, leading to a surge in the&#13;
unemployment rates to 8.4 percent in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, the unemployment rates fell gradually,&#13;
almost returning to the pre-crisis level.&#13;

     After rapid improvements in the ï¬&#129;rst half of 2011, the labor market stabilized in the second&#13;
half of the year. Up until July 2011, the main labor market outcomes had gradually improved with&#13;
the activity, employment, and unemployment rates reaching pre-crisis levels. The unemployment&#13;
rate reached 6.1 percent in June, rose slightly to 6.5 percent in July, and ï¬&#130;uctuated around this level&#13;
through the end of the year. Similarly, economic activity and employment rates increased in the ï¬&#129;rst&#13;
half of the year, but gradually fell in the last quarter of 2011 in line with seasonal trends.&#13;
     Overall, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s employment levels recovered fairly quickly from the crisis. In the third quar-&#13;
ter of 2011, output remained close to 1.5 percent below the pre-crisis level of the second quarter of&#13;
2008. By contrast, employment already exceeded this level by over 0.5 percent (Figure 20).&#13;

     Hiring and ï¬&#129;ring balanced out labor supply and demand in 2011. After the crisis hit in the fall&#13;
of 2008, ï¬&#129;ring exceeded hiring by almost one quarter. Since January 2010 the balance between hiring&#13;
and ï¬&#129;ring has been gradually restored, with the replacement rates, expressed as a ratio of hiring to&#13;
ï¬&#129;ring almost equal to one through 2011 (Figure 21). Replacement rates improved as of January 2012&#13;
in comparison to the same period in 2009 in almost all sectors. Replacement rates exceeded unity in&#13;
energy, construction, and mining sectors, as they were hiring more workers than ï¬&#129;ring. The number&#13;
of vacancies fell sharply during the crisis, but increased gradually increased since February 2010. In&#13;
August 2011 it reached its highest point and then fell slightly through the end of the year in view&#13;
of seasonal factors.&#13;

      The reduction in unemployment was so far supported by a fairly smooth job search process.&#13;
This is demonstrated by the Beveridge curve, which shows the relationship between the vacancy rate&#13;
(the number of unï¬&#129;lled jobs expressed as a proportion of the labor force) and the unemployment rate&#13;
(Figure 22). We look at the trends for the fourth quarter in order to eliminate the effect of seasonal-&#13;
ity. From 2007 to 2009, the rise in unemployment coincided with a drop in job openings. From 2009&#13;
to 2011, lower unemployment came together with more job openings. However, the reduction in the&#13;
unemployment rate from 2010 to 2011 translated into a noticeable increase in the vacancy rate. This&#13;
could be a sign that larger increases in vacancy rates are needed to bring about further reductions in&#13;
unemployment in the next years.&#13;

      The positive developments in the labor market characterize all federal districts; however,&#13;
regional diversity persists. The unemployment rate was reduced in all districts beginning in 2010&#13;
and continued to fall during 2011. As of July 2011, the lowest level of unemployment was observed&#13;
in the Central federal district (4.2 percent), and the highest in the North-Caucasian federal district&#13;
(15.1 percent). The unemployment rate in 2011 was more than 10 percent higher than in 2008 in the&#13;
Ural Federal District, North-Western District, and Central Federal Districts.&#13;
      The diversity in the unemployment recovery on the regional level is striking. In 44 out of&#13;
83 regions, unemployment levels in 2011 were still signiï¬&#129;cantly higher than in 2008. As illustrated&#13;
on the map below, the unemployment rates in 2011 remained above the 2008 levels in many regions&#13;
(Figure 23).3 This trend was especially prominent in the following regions: Ryazan, Pskov, Moscow&#13;
city, Sverdlovsk, Bashkortostan, Moscow, Tula, and Chelyabinsk, where the unemployment rate in&#13;
2011 was higher by 30 percent or more than in 2008.&#13;

     The gap in unemployment rates between rural and urban areas increased since autumn, while&#13;
gender gaps returned to the pre-crisis level. The unemployment rate has signiï¬&#129;cantly increased in&#13;
rural areas since August 2011, consistent with seasonal patterns (Figure 24). At the same time, the&#13;
unemployment rate in urban areas continued to steadily fall throughout the year. In January 2012, the&#13;
unemployment rate in rural areas reached 10.4 percent - almost twice as high as in urban areas. During&#13;
the crisis, the gap in unemployment rates between males and females became noticeably higher due to&#13;
a signiï¬&#129;cant hit to construction and manufacturing jobs. However the gap has since diminished with&#13;
the market recovery.&#13;

16 | Russian Economic Report. â&#132;&#150; 27. April 2012&#13;
&amp;#12;     Real incomes increased in each of the last four years, but the composition of income sources&#13;
changed. During the crisis, despite a sharp reduction in GDP, real incomes increased 1.8 percent&#13;
(Figure 25). Real wages fell in 2009 3.5 percent, but the expansion in pensions and social assistance&#13;
beneï¬&#129;ts contributed to the increase in incomes, and the vast expansion of social protection beneï¬&#129;ts&#13;
continued in 2010. Pensions increased in real terms by 18.1 percent in 2008, 10.7 percent in 2009,&#13;
and 34.8 percent in 2010. As a result of the expansion of social protection beneï¬&#129;ts, the share of the&#13;
these beneï¬&#129;ts in total incomes of the population increased from 11.6 percent in 2007 to 18.1 percent&#13;
in 2011, the highest rate over the last 20 years. In 2011, real income growth was 1.1 percent, the low-&#13;
est rate in many years. In contrast, real wages increased 4.2 percent, although only 2 percent for the&#13;
public sector.&#13;

     The improvement in the economic situation of people led with a reduction in inequality. In&#13;
2009, consumption growth turned negative for middle and high income people, while it remained&#13;
fairly stable for poorer households. Since 2009, consumption growth increased for all groups but&#13;
remain higher for lower deciles. This translated into a reduction in inequality (Figure 26).&#13;
     However, the ofï¬&#129;cial poverty rates remained broadly stable, mainly because of the real&#13;
increase in the subsistence minimum. Despite real consumption growth and inequality reduction,&#13;
poverty rates stayed ï¬&#130;at through 2007â&#128;&#148;2011. This is because poor people consume a higher share of&#13;
food and necessities than non-poor people, and prices of such basic goods increased especially fast&#13;
in recent years. Changes of the subsistence minimum correspond closely to changes in the food price&#13;
index. Thus, while the cumulative rate of inï¬&#130;ation from 2007 to 2011 was 48 percent, the subsistence&#13;
minimum grew 68 percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Credit â&#128;&#148; low inï¬&#130;ation,&#13;
tight liquidity, strong credit growth&#13;
Inï¬&#130;ation declined sharply as local governments delayed increases in administrative prices, food inï¬&#130;ation&#13;
declined, monetary policy tightened, and the exchange rate appreciated. Credit to household and nonï¬&#129;nancial&#13;
corporations picked up, even though real interest rates increased.&#13;
&#13;
     Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s headline inï¬&#130;ation dropped to its lowest level of the last two decades. Price pressures&#13;
moderated thanks to low food and services inï¬&#130;ation and a favorable base effect, as well as an appre-&#13;
ciating exchange rate and tighter monetary policy (Figure 27). CPI inï¬&#130;ation declined for the tenth&#13;
months in a row from 9.7 percent in April 2011 to 3.8 percent in February 2012, the lowest reading&#13;
since the early 1990s. Low food inï¬&#130;ation helped to reduce headline inï¬&#130;ation, as Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s agricul-&#13;
ture went from a bad to a good harvest. In addition, services inï¬&#130;ation declined, as utility prices are&#13;
set to increase only in July this year rather than January as last year, and petrol stations delayed&#13;
increases in gasoline prices in response to higher international oil prices. As a result, from December&#13;
to January, prices increased only 0.4 percent this year compared to 2.4 percent last year. However,&#13;
not only headline inï¬&#130;ation declined, but also core inï¬&#130;ation, which excludes fruits and vegetables,&#13;
fuel and administrated service prices. Core inï¬&#130;ation reached 5.7 percent in February 2012, down&#13;
from 8.4 percent in July 2011. This indicates that monetary and exchange rate factors also played a&#13;
role in bringing down inï¬&#130;ation.&#13;

     The appreciation of the exchange rate moderated price pressures. In the third quarter of 2011,&#13;
market sentiment deteriorated due to concerns about the euro area, putting pressure on the ruble&#13;
(Figure 28). Subsequently, the ruble appreciated as oil prices increased and, more recently, market&#13;
                                                             sentiment picked up. This dampened&#13;

&amp;#12;      Tighter monetary policy also contributed to lowering inï¬&#130;ation. While headline CPI inï¬&#130;ation&#13;
fell almost 520 basis points from June 2011 to February 2012, the CBR lowered its reï¬&#129;nancing rate&#13;
only once during this time, lowering it by only 25 basis points to 8 percent in January 2012 (Figure&#13;
29). As a result, real interest rates turned positive in September 2011. This curtailed domestic&#13;
demand, although, as inï¬&#130;ation is expected to pick up later in the year, the economically relevant&#13;
real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus expected inï¬&#130;ation) is not as high as the current inï¬&#130;a-&#13;
tion rate indicates. At the same time, the CBR increased its overnight deposit rate in September&#13;
2011 and January 2012 by 25 basis points each to a level of 4 percent. Hence, the policy interest&#13;
rate corridor narrowed 75 basis points over this period, although it remains relatively wide by&#13;
international standards. Minimum capital requirements for banks doubled to 180 million rubles&#13;
in January 2012, and are set to increase to 300 million rubles in 2015. During this time though, the&#13;
CBR also reduced the stock of bank liquidity. For example, the percentage of liquid assets held by&#13;
banks declined to just under 24 percent in early 2012, down from over 29 percent in the second&#13;
quarter of 2009. Liquidity fell as the CBR switched from net purchases of foreign exchange in the&#13;
ï¬&#129;rst half to net sales of foreign exchange in the second half of 2011, while demand for cash rubles&#13;
continued to grow with nominal wage growth of 12 percent (Figure 30 and Figure 31). As a result,&#13;
banks had to rely more on the CBRâ&#128;&#153;s reï¬&#129;nancing operations as a source for liquidity, along with&#13;
short-term Ministry of Finance deposits. For example, banks borrowed over 0.8 trillion rubles from&#13;
the CBR in November and December 2011, the highest volume borrowed since 2002. Hence, the&#13;
interbank interest rate moved away from the deposit rate towards the center of the interest cor-&#13;
ridor. The absorption of bank liquidity, along with large capital outï¬&#130;ows, translated into a slower&#13;
expansion of the money supply. Growth of M2 money supply declined to 21.4 percent in 2011 from&#13;
30.7 percent in 2010.&#13;

tion fell. Whereas the spread between lending rates to households and the CBR reï¬&#129;nancing rate&#13;
remained high at 1695 basis points in November 2011, lending rates to enterprises converged almost&#13;
to the level of the reï¬&#129;nancing rate. Lending rates for corporations are much lower than for house-&#13;
holds. This is in part due to large intra-group lending and a high concentration of loans to single&#13;
corporate borrowers, as well as the higher risk perception of household lending, especially in the&#13;
absence of collateral.&#13;
     In spite of higher interest rates, credit to the private sector continued to recover. The total stock&#13;
of credit to the private sector increased 26 percent in nominal terms in 2011. This lifted private credit&#13;
to 46.1 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2011 from 43.9 percent of GDP a year ago (Figure 32).&#13;
Credit to households, including for example mortgages, consumer lines of credit and car loans, rose&#13;
34 percent, and credit to non-ï¬&#129;nancial corporations increased 24 percent. Mortgage lending, which&#13;
was supported by a government reï¬&#129;nancing program, decreased down-payment requirements, and&#13;
an average lending rate of just 11.9 percent (the lowest rate in the history of mortgage lending in&#13;
Russia), saw particularly strong growth, reaching 713 billion rubles last year, up from 380 billion&#13;
rubles in 2010. Furthermore, the share of non-performing loans decreased to 6.6 percent of all loans in&#13;
January 2012, down from 8.2 percent in January 2011 and 9.5 percent in January 2010. However, the&#13;
share of loans that are non-performing as well as the share of loans with loan loss provision place-&#13;
ments remain above pre-crisis levels (Figure 32).&#13;

20 | Russian Economic Report. â&#132;&#150; 27. April 2012&#13;
&amp;#12;Fiscal Policyâ&#128;&#148;improving headline ï¬&#129;gures,&#13;
worsening non-oil imbalances&#13;
The 2011 ï¬&#129;scal outcomes were strong, bolstered by high oil prices and a cautious expenditure execution.&#13;
However, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s public ï¬&#129;nances face a number of strains in the coming years. They include worsening ï¬&#129;s-&#13;
cal balances, a high dependency on oil and gas revenues, the need to replenish the ï¬&#129;scal reserve funds, and the&#13;
emergence of new expenditure pressures.&#13;
&#13;
     In 2011, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s consolidated budget balance turned to surplus thanks to favorable oil prices&#13;
and prudent expenditure execution. The consolidated budget surplus amounted to 1.6 percent of&#13;
GDP in 2011, compared to a deï¬&#129;cit of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2010 (Table 5). Revenues contributed&#13;
about 70 percent of the improvement. This reï¬&#130;ected strong tax receipts from natural resources and&#13;
customs duties due to high oil prices, strong social security contributions due to a hike in pay-&#13;
roll tax rates from 26 percent to 34 percent as well as robust wage growth, increased proï¬&#129;t taxes&#13;
due to improved enterprise proï¬&#129;t margins, and an increase in VAT due to strong consumption.&#13;
Expenditures fell 1.5 percent of GDP, as the gradual phase-out of anti-crisis measures continued and&#13;
expenditures were executed below plan.&#13;

    The improvement of the consolidated budget balance was almost entirely due to the federal&#13;
budget. Federal expenditures remained over one percent of GDP above the original budget target,&#13;
and federal revenues over three percent of GDP. Consolidated sub-national budget expenditures and&#13;
revenues both decreased around 0.5 percent of GDP, and extra-budgetary fundsâ&#128;&#153; revenues increased&#13;
somewhat more than expenditures. Federal public debt remained low at around 10 percent of GDP in&#13;
2011, one ï¬&#129;fth of which was external (Box 3).&#13;

        Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s strong fiscal headline numbers, the improvement in global market sentiment, and the end of the elec-&#13;
   tion cycle helped to boost government bonds (Figure 33). 5-year credit default swaps spreads declined to their&#13;
   lowest levels since early August 2011. Spreads on sovereign debt also declined. For example, the spread over US&#13;
   Treasuries in mid-March was 248 for Russia, some 73 below the average for emerging markets. Rising demand for&#13;
   Russia sovereign paper boosted returns for its holders.&#13;

&#13;
        The rally on Russian fixed income securities was also supported by regulatory changes. As part of the&#13;
   efforts to develop Moscow as an international financial center, regulators have, for the first time, made Russian&#13;
   domestic debt (OFZs) tradable over the counter since the beginning of this year. In addition, the government and the&#13;
   CBR are working to establish a centralized depository by June 2012. This would allow non-resident investors to open&#13;
   nominal holder accounts with Russian depositories. This is expected to prompt Euroclear Bank, the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest&#13;
   provider of bond settlement, to make OFZs euroclearable in the second half of 2012. These steps will make it easier&#13;
   for investors to trade Russian debt.&#13;

     In spite of the improvement in headline ï¬&#129;scal outcomes, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s public ï¬&#129;nances face a num-&#13;
ber of strains in the coming years. They include worsening ï¬&#129;scal balances, a high dependency on oil&#13;
and gas revenues, the need to replenish the ï¬&#129;scal reserve funds, and the emergence of new expendi-&#13;
ture pressures.&#13;

22 | Russian Economic Report. â&#132;&#150; 27. April 2012&#13;
&amp;#12;     The consolidated and ï¬&#129;scal budgets are expected to turn to a deï¬&#129;cit in 2012. Even though&#13;
the output gap is closing and economic growth is broadly in line with its potential, the consoli-&#13;
dated budget could deteriorate 2.7 percent of GDP from 2011 to 2012 (Table 6). Of course, higher-&#13;
than-anticipated oil prices could once again result in better-than-planned outcomes. However,&#13;
during the ï¬&#129;rst two months of 2012, the federal government deï¬&#129;cit was around 3 percent of GDP&#13;
in part due large expenditure disbursements for the ï¬&#129;rst quarter of the ï¬&#129;scal year. In particular,&#13;
allocations of inter-governmental transfers to the regions, advance payments for military modern-&#13;
ization, and quarterly subsidies to organizations in health and education contributed to a budget&#13;
deï¬&#129;cit.&#13;
     The federal budget relies increasingly on high oil prices. This is borne out by three indicators.&#13;
First, in 2011, oil and gas revenues were 10.4 percent of GDP, equal to half of federal revenues. In&#13;
2009, they were only 7.6 percent of GDP, equal to two-ï¬&#129;fths of federal revenues. Second, the federal&#13;
budget is based on a higher oil price assumption than in the past. The Urals oil price assumption of&#13;
the federal budget increased from US$75/barrels in 2011 to 100 in 2012. Third, the oil price needed&#13;
for the federal budget to break even increased from less than US$30 up to 2007 to around US$100&#13;
or more since 2009. For 2012, the break even oil price is estimated to be over US$110. Hence, even&#13;
a moderate correction in the oil prices could reverse improvements on the revenue side achieved&#13;
in 2011.&#13;
     The national reserve and national prosperity funds still need to be replenished. They declined&#13;
from 16.0 percent of GDP in 2008 to only 6.6 percent of GDP in 2011 as the government used the&#13;
resources to stabilize the economy during the crisis. While the reserve fund increased again in the&#13;
ï¬&#129;rst two months of 2012, mainly thanks to the transfer of the 2011 ï¬&#129;scal surplus, it is projected to stay&#13;
below 10 percent of GDP by 2014 (Figure 34). In addition, in the absence of a ï¬&#129;scal rule, such as a&#13;
limit on the non-oil ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit, the effectiveness of these funds to shelter the economy from oil price&#13;
volatility and ensure intergenerational equity, is diminished.&#13;

     Additional expenditure pressures weigh on the federal budget law for 2012â&#128;&#148;2014. They&#13;
relate to a military modernization program and commitments to increase wages and pension of mil-&#13;
itary and security personnel. In addition, ï¬&#129;scal plans envision an increase in outlays for road main-&#13;
tenance in 2013 (Table 7). Spending on federal transfers to extra-budgetary funds and social policy&#13;
is projected to increase from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2013. According&#13;
to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s medium term plans for 2012 to 2014, these additional expenditures amount to&#13;
more than 4 percent of GDP. Moreover, the decline in oil production is expected to continue in the&#13;
medium term, resulting in a decrease in oil revenues by almost 2 percent of GDP over the next three&#13;
years. In addition, the medium-term federal budget for 2012â&#128;&#148;2014 does not include pre-election&#13;
commitments made by the President-elect Putin. This could result in additional spending of about&#13;
0.5 to 1.5 percent of GDP per year over the next 6 years. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s aging infrastructure also requires&#13;
resources in excess of those allocated in the budget plans.&#13;

     To deal with new expenditure pressures, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s federal budget for 2012 to 2014 aims&#13;
to gradually broaden the non-oil revenue base and reduce non-priority expenditures. Efforts to&#13;
broaden the non-oil revenue base include increasing taxes on alcohol and tobacco products as well as&#13;
transferring the collection of the vehicle registration tax to the federal budget. Reprioritization of other&#13;
expenditures is expected to result in additional ï¬&#129;scal savings of about 3.3 percent of GDP. While part&#13;
of these savings reï¬&#130;ects cuts in general public services and economic affairs, a sizable part is a shift&#13;
of responsibilities for service provision in health, education and housing services to agencies outside&#13;
the federal budget.&#13;

&#13;
Prospectsâ&#128;&#148;moderate slowdown as global growth eases&#13;
With the slowdown of growth in Europe and elsewhere, growth in Russia is likely to moderate somewhat in&#13;
2012, before picking up again in 2013. Downside risks to growth include a drop in oil prices either due to weak&#13;
global demand or a correction of oil supply disturbances. In addition, growth could disappoint in case consump-&#13;
tion and investment weaken in view of tight liquidity and sluggish external demand. Upside risks include that&#13;
oil prices remain high as supply disturbances continue or global demand rebounces faster-than-expected from&#13;
the current slowdown.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Economic news during the ï¬&#129;rst two months of 2012 has been positive, but the global recovery&#13;
remains fragile. After several months of heightened uncertainty, conditions in ï¬&#129;nancial markets have&#13;
improved signiï¬&#129;cantly during the ï¬&#129;rst three months of 2012, with spreads paid on sovereign debt of&#13;
both high-spread European and developing economies coming off their late 2011 highs in response&#13;
to ECB policy steps, the successful restructuring of Greek debt and progress toward ï¬&#129;scal consolida-&#13;
tion. In spite of these positive developments, the uncertainty of the second half of 2011 has taken its&#13;
toll, with Europe having re-entered recession toward the end of 2011 and falling European imports&#13;
cutting into global trade. In 2012, growth in the euro area is expected to drop more than 1.5 percen-&#13;
tage points, leading to a mild recession in the euro area and stagnation in the EU. Despite these head-&#13;
winds, economic activity and business expectations outside of Europe are improving. The recovery&#13;
in the US is strengthening and other emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India, South Africa&#13;
and Turkey, where industrial production had been previously decelerating, are now all seeing an&#13;
up-tick in activity. Reï¬&#130;ecting these improving prospects, metal and oil prices have ï¬&#129;rmed in recent&#13;
months. Nevertheless, continued ï¬&#129;scal contraction in Europe, ongoing banking-sector de-leveraging,&#13;
and still elevated risk aversion are all expected to weigh on activity in 2012. After expanding 4.2 per-&#13;
cent in 2010, global GDP slowed to 2.7 percent in 2011, and is expected to come in at a relatively weak&#13;
2.5 percent in 2012 before ï¬&#129;rming to 3.1 percent in 2013 (Table 8 and Figure 35). Developing country&#13;
growth is projected to come in at 5.4 percent, the second worst result in 10 yearsâ&#128;&#148;only the crisis&#13;
year of 2009 was worse. GDP among high-income countries is expected to expand only 1.4 percent.&#13;
Outturns remain vulnerable to a deterioration of conditions in Europe. While the likelihood of such&#13;
a signiï¬&#129;cant deterioration has eased, the risk remains real and could have large implications for the&#13;
global economy including developing countries.&#13;

&#13;
     Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is expected to slow somewhat in 2012, and to pick up in 2013. Our baseline&#13;
scenario assumes that the actions of European policy makers succeed in gradually reducing risks&#13;
associated with the euro crisis. Nevertheless, growth in Russia faces headwinds as growth declines in&#13;
the EU (Box 4), eases in developing countries, and global capital ï¬&#130;ows moderate. We also assume that&#13;
oil prices will moderate from todayâ&#128;&#153;s high levels (Box 5). As a result, investors could remain cautious&#13;
and adopt a wait-and-see attitude before undertaking large commitments. Hence, we project growth&#13;
in Russia to decline from 4.3 percent in 2011 to 3.5 percent in 2012 (Table 9). Domestic demand will&#13;
support the expansion of economic activity, aided by a carry-over of the growth momentum from&#13;
end-2011, improving conï¬&#129;dence of businesses and ï¬&#129;nancial markets, and a higher ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit. In&#13;
spite of positive real interest rates, consumption growth is set to remain robust in view of low inï¬&#130;ation&#13;
and low unemployment. Fixed investment is expected to improve as companies respond to capacity&#13;
constraints and a more stable economic outlook. However, the contribution to growth of agriculture,&#13;
which was bolstered through a bumper crop and a low base in 2011, is projected to be minor. Likewise,&#13;
as the inventory cycle comes to an end, the contribution of restocking, which played an important role&#13;
in supporting growth in 2010 and 2011, will decline. In 2013, an acceleration of growth in Europe and&#13;
elsewhere, along with improving industrial production, will lift growth in Russia. However, the clos-&#13;
ing of the output gap, the tightening of labor markets, and the modest decline in oil prices are set to&#13;
limit growth to 3.9 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    Box 4. Russia and the European Union&#13;
&#13;
         Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s territory is four times as large as the EUâ&#128;&#153;s, with a population only two-seventh as large. In purchasing&#13;
    power parity, its 2010 GDP per capita was equal to 55 percent of the level of the EU. However, in current dollar, its&#13;
    overall GDP was only 9 percent of the size of the EU economy. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s main trading partner is the EU. It accounted&#13;
    for 47 percent of trade turnover in 2010. In 2010, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s imports of goods and services from the EU amounted&#13;
    EUR108 billion, and its exports to the EU reached EUR173 billion. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s exports are mainly energy and mineral&#13;
    fuel products, while Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s imports range from machinery and transport equipment, to manufactured goods and&#13;
    food. Some three quarters of FDI stocks in Russia come from the EU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We project modest reductions in poverty in the coming years. In view of the low elasticity of&#13;
growth in the recent years and lower growth rates than prior to the crisis, projected poverty rates in&#13;
2012 will be 12.7 percent and 12.5 percent in 2013.&#13;

&#13;
      In our baseline scenario, the current account surplus and capital account deï¬&#129;cit are set to&#13;
decline and the ï¬&#129;scal balance is set to turn into a deï¬&#129;cit. The balance of payments position is expected&#13;
to remain strong, even though capital ï¬&#130;ows are likely to remain volatile. Under our conservative oil&#13;
price forecast, we expect the surplus of the external current account to reach 2.7 percent of GDP in&#13;
2012 and 1.1 percent of GDP in 2013. This reï¬&#130;ects a combination of stagnant oil production volumes,&#13;
somewhat moderating oil prices, and increasing import demand. In 2012, the capital account deï¬&#129;cit is&#13;
projected to moderate as global conditions gradually improve, the risk appetite of investors improves,&#13;
the OFZ market liberalization proceeds, and debt repayments decline. The capital account deï¬&#129;cit is&#13;
set to continue to decline in 2013 as the global market sentiment picks up further. Under the new oil&#13;
price assumptions and budget parameters for 2012â&#128;&#148;14, we project that the consolidated budget will&#13;
run a deï¬&#129;cit of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2012 and of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2013. However, the non-oil&#13;
deï¬&#129;cit is projected to rise from 9.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to more than 10 percent in 2012 and 2013.&#13;
Inï¬&#130;ation is expected to stay low in the coming months in view of tight monetary policy and recent&#13;
exchange rate appreciation. However, it is set to increase later in the year as the delayed increases in&#13;
utility prices take effect in July. In addition, demand pressures are likely to strengthen as the output&#13;
gap closes and labor shortages emerge. By year-end, inï¬&#130;ation could be close to the upper limit of the&#13;
CBRâ&#128;&#153;s target band of 5.0 to 6.0 percent.&#13;
      There are domestic and external downside risks to our baseline scenario. The main domestic&#13;
risk factor is that positive real interest rates, tight liquidity and weak manufacturing could translate&#13;
into weaker-than-expected credit expansion, consumption and investment. But more important is the&#13;
external risk factor. The ongoing slowdown of growth in Europe and in developing countries could&#13;
persist through the year, if adverse feedback loops between sovereign and bank funding pressures&#13;
resurface in the euro area, and bank deleveraging is more protracted. This could trigger a drop in&#13;
global oil prices, leading to a ï¬&#130;ight to safety of capital ï¬&#130;ows from emerging markets. In Russia, lower&#13;
oil prices would translate into larger ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit, larger capital outï¬&#130;ows, weaker current account&#13;
position in spite of a weaker exchange rate, and lower growth (Table 10).&#13;

     The main upside risk to our baseline scenario is a higher oil price. The price for Urals crude&#13;
rose in early March above US$125 per barrel for the ï¬&#129;rst time since July 2008, mainly due to supply&#13;
disturbances in the Middle East. This has helped spur the stock market, lift the ruble, and improve&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                II. Economic Outlook | 27&#13;
&amp;#12;business conï¬&#129;dence in Russia. If the oil price were to remain high, this would boost growth, improve&#13;
current and capital account balances and help to maintain the surplus of the ï¬&#129;scal accounts. At the&#13;
same time, it would lead to price pressures and increase the risk of overheating in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 5. Global Oil Market Developments&#13;
&#13;
        In 2012, oil prices jumped on fears of production losses, notably from Iran, but from other oil producers as well,&#13;
   such as Iraq, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and the North Sea. Prices have also been supported by improv-&#13;
   ing macroeconomic data, low stocks and a bout of cold weather in Europe and Asia. The price of Brent crude has&#13;
   surged above US$126 per barrel, with Urals trading near parity as European refiners search for crudes to replace&#13;
   Iranian grades, and as more Urals crude is shipped to eastern export markets and to domestic refineries. Meanwhile,&#13;
   WTI prices continue to trade at a large discount to Brent due to transportation bottlenecks in the US at Cushing OK,&#13;
   rising crude inflows from Canada, and liquids-rich shale projects in North Dakota, which have limited outlet to Gulf&#13;
   coast refiners.&#13;
        An EU embargo of Iranian crude, and US sanctions that penalize companies that do business with Iranian banks,&#13;
   are both set to come into full force in July. The EU embargo could affect up to 0.6 mb/d of Iranian exports, although&#13;
   broader U.S. and EU economic sanctions on Iranâ&#128;&#153;s Central Bank could curtail exports further. European customers&#13;
   have already curtailed Iranian imports, and Asian buyers are lining up alternative sources of supply. European cus-&#13;
   tomers are likely to look to Russia, Iraq and Saudi Arabia for replacement barrels. Up to 1 mb/d of Iranâ&#128;&#153;s 2.6 mb/d of&#13;
   exports may be replaced by alternative supplies once sanctions go into effect.&#13;
        World oil demand growth slowed sharply in 2011 to just 0.7 mb/d or 0.8 percent, from a large 2.7 mb/d or&#13;
   3.2 percent gain in 2010. In the first quarter, world oil rose marginally, weighed down by weak economic activity, mild&#13;
   weather, and high prices. Oil demand in the OECD has fallen for 5 out of the past 6 years, for a combined loss of&#13;
   4.3 mb/d or 7.5%, and is due in part to high oil prices. Non-OECD countries are less immune to high prices, in part&#13;
   because many countries are growing rapidly and need energy to expand output and raise incomes. In addition, many&#13;
   countries maintain large subsidies to energy consumers, particularly in oil producing countries.&#13;
        On the supply side, non-OPEC oil production grew little in 2011 due to a number of production outages, notably&#13;
   in the North Sea, Yemen, Sudan, and Syria, but also shortfalls from a number of other producing countries such&#13;
   as Australia, Azerbaijan, and China. Despite meager growth in production overall, there were significant gains in a&#13;
   number of countriesâ&#128;&#148;the five largest contributors (U.S., Colombia, Russia, Canada, and Brazil) grew a combined&#13;
   0.7 mb/d. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s oil production rose 0.13 mb/d 2011, and is projected to grow 0.14 mb/d in 2012, due to ramp-up&#13;
   of major projects.&#13;
        The slowdown in non-OPEC production last year allowed total OPEC output to rise by nearly 1.0 mb/d. The&#13;
   Organization agreed to a new crude oil production target of 30 mb/d for 2012, which now includes Iraq, but individual&#13;
   country quotas were not assigned. Saudi Arabiaâ&#128;&#153;s oil minister said they would produce according to market demand,&#13;
   and now states that they prefer oil prices at $100/bbl. The rise in OPEC production has lowered its spare capacity to&#13;
   under 4 mb/d, with more than half in Saudi Arabia. Libyaâ&#128;&#153;s oil production began to steadily recover in the fall of 2011,&#13;
   and has reportedly climbed above 1.3 mb/d, with exports at 1.2 mb/d.&#13;
        Tensions between Iran and the West are expected to dominate market sentiment until there is satisfactory resolu-&#13;
   tion to Iranâ&#128;&#153;s suspected nuclear weapons program. Iran has also threatened to blockade the Strait of Hormuz where&#13;
   some 17 mb/d of crude oil and refined products transit, even though such a cutoff is seen as unlikely. Still, it is not&#13;
   hard to envisage oil prices grinding higher under such tensions and uncertainty. However, in the absence of a major&#13;
   outage, it is unlikely that oil prices would stay above US$120/bbl for an extended period, as demand has proved&#13;
   resistant in recent years when prices were much above this level. It is expected that OPEC will keep the market well&#13;
   suppliedâ&#128;&#148;as Saudi Arabia and the group have stated they will doâ&#128;&#148;and will not want to unduly threaten the fragile&#13;
   global economic recovery. Seasonal demand is falling, and the IEA and the U.S. have said they would draw down&#13;
   emergency reserves if needed.&#13;
        The World Bank oil price forecast is set at US$98.2/bbl in 2012 and falls to US$94.7/bbl in 2015. The forecast&#13;
   assumes a gradual resolution to current oil supply disruptions, and no large-scale impact from sanctions on Iran.&#13;
   OPEC spare capacity is more than sufficient to make up for a large reduction in Iranian oil exports, however it could&#13;
   take OPEC spare capacity to lower levels. Global oil demand is expected to rise by 1.0-1.5% over the forecast period,&#13;
   with all of the growth in non-OECD countries. Non-OPEC oil supply is expected to increase by 1.0 mb/d in 2012, and&#13;
   continue to record moderate gains. The surge is shale liquids production in the U.S. is turning that county into major&#13;
   supply growth region, and shale production could expand to other countries around the world.&#13;
        OPEC crude oil production is not expected to increase in 2012, and may contract. OPEC countries will have to&#13;
   juggle production depending on losses of Iranian crude, the rise in Libyaâ&#128;&#153;s production, and growth in new capacity in&#13;
   Iraq. Over the medium-term, OPEC producers are expected to absorb a portion of the moderate growth in global oil&#13;
   demand. This will erode surplus capacity only modestly, as most countries are investing in new capacity.&#13;

        The differential between Brent and WTI is expected to narrow by 2015 due to the expected construction of new&#13;
   pipelines and reversals to take surplus Canadian and domestic crudes to Gulf refineries. However, rising output&#13;
   is expected to keep WTI from returning to premium status before 2015. The price of Urals is expected to decline&#13;
   relative to Brent, as light/sweet crude output returns, and incremental OPEC output is of heavier grade. The price&#13;
   of Urals is projected to decline from US$100.0/bbl in 2011 to US$93.9/bbl in 2015.&#13;
        There are a number of risks to the forecast. Global supply risks remain from further geopolitical turmoil and&#13;
   outages, and unexpected technical problems. A major supply cutoff could, of course, result in prices spiking well&#13;
   above US$150/bbl depending on the severity, duration, and response (from OPEC, emergency reserves, and&#13;
   demand curtailment). On the other hand, there are also downside risks to prices from weaker oil demand and&#13;
   slower economic growth, and to the ongoing impact of high oil pricesâ&#128;&#148;a key issue that OPEC should pay heed.&#13;
   A key element for price stability will be how OPEC responds to higher or lower demand for its crude. Historically&#13;
   OPEC has been very quick to defend a price floor with sharp cuts (e.g., end-2008), but has been very unwilling&#13;
   or unable to set a price ceiling (e.g., 1H-2008). The oil burden of GDP is steadily rising, and approaching near&#13;
   2008 levels for some economies. While not enough to derail economic growth by itself, it does raise inflationary&#13;
   concerns and hence puts pressure on the ongoing loose monetary policy, which in turn can have a detrimental&#13;
   impact on nascent global growth, particularly in the OECD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policiesâ&#128;&#148;moderating risks, bolstering growth&#13;
&#13;
Economic policy should aim to reinvigorate growth in two ways. Economic policies should ensure macroeco-&#13;
nomic stability as the output gap is closing; and lift structural barriers to productivity growth and economic&#13;
diversiï¬&#129;cation. WTO accession offers a unique opportunity to advance this agenda.&#13;
&#13;
     Russia has progressed signiï¬&#129;cantly since the crisis a few years ago but could do much better.&#13;
Before the crisis, the economy grew at more than 7 percent. Now, growth has slowed to around 4 per-&#13;
cent, even though oil prices are high. Strengthening Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic outlook involves responding&#13;
to two challenges. While Russia did well during the crisis, it still has to readjust policies to ensure&#13;
macroeconomic stability as the output gap is closing and the external environment remains uncertain.&#13;
In addition, Russia faces the longer-term challenge of improving productivity and diversifying the&#13;
economy against the backdrop of a shrinking labor force.&#13;
     Fiscal policy should be used to rebuild ï¬&#129;scal buffers while oil prices are still high. This&#13;
would make sure that ï¬&#129;scal policy does not become procyclical, as the output gap closes. And it&#13;
would reduce the vulnerability of public ï¬&#129;nances to the volatility in oil prices as the Reserve Fund&#13;
remains far below the pre-crisis level. This means sticking to prudent spending plans and saving&#13;
oil revenues that come in over and above budget. It also means establishing a clear medium-term&#13;
anchor for ï¬&#129;scal policy. A key policy decision would be to move the focus of ï¬&#129;scal policy from the&#13;
overall ï¬&#129;scal balance to the non-oil ï¬&#129;scal balance. Prior to the crisis, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s long-term ï¬&#129;scal target&#13;
was a 4.7 percent of GDP non-oil ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit target. The target was suspended during the crisis,&#13;
and the non-oil ï¬&#129;scal deï¬&#129;cit is set to remain above 10 percent of GDP this year. Alternatively, in&#13;
order to delink the budget from oil price volatility and ensure intergenerational equity, Russia could&#13;
adopt an oil-price rule, along with an aggregate borrowing ceiling. Strengthening public sector gov-&#13;
ernance and raising the quality of public spending would be crucial for bringing about ï¬&#129;scal savings&#13;
while maintaining public services. This would also create the room to invest in growth-enhancing&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
     Focusing monetary policy on low inï¬&#130;ation and strengthening ï¬&#129;nancial sector oversight&#13;
would also limit Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to adverse external developments. Continuing to move to&#13;
inï¬&#130;ation targeting and allowing greater exchange rate ï¬&#130;exibility are also important to limit the vul-&#13;
nerability of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s balance of payments to oil prices shocks. It would strengthen the CBRâ&#128;&#153;s ability&#13;
to withstand an oil price shock without signiï¬&#129;cant losses of its foreign exchange reserves. Greater&#13;
exchange rate ï¬&#130;exibility also discourages speculative capital inï¬&#130;ows. Together with improving&#13;
banking supervision, these policies will make the economy more stable and help to bolster Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
ï¬&#129;nancial markets.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Structural reforms are needed to strengthen Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic outlook. Removing structural&#13;
barriers to growth can help to bolster and diversify the economy in a sustainable way. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2020&#13;
Strategy Update, prepared by a group of independent advisors to the government and presented on&#13;
March 16, 2012, lays out an ambitious reform program for the coming years. Russia faces an agenda of&#13;
reducing the stateâ&#128;&#153;s footprint on the economy through privatization (for example, the federal budget&#13;
for 2012â&#128;&#148;2014 foresees a privatization program of 0.5 to 0.7 percent of GDP annually), improving&#13;
governance, and enabling workers and entrepreneurs to contribute to and beneï¬&#129;ts from economic&#13;
prosperity (Figure 36). Easing the cost of doing business remains central to these efforts (Box 6).&#13;
The accession to the World Trade Organization expected this summer is an important milestone for&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic development, as we discuss in the last section of this report.&#13;

      Box 6. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2012 Doing Business ranking&#13;
&#13;
           The success of an economy depends in large measure on ensuring that small and medium sized enter-&#13;
      prises (SMEs) are able to do business easily. In leading economies, SMEs are key drivers of job creation, innova-&#13;
      tion, competition, and economic growth. However, thriving SMEs rely on a regulatory environment that encourages&#13;
      their creation and growth. As policy makers look into ways to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory environment,&#13;
      a good place to start is to find out how it compares with the regulatory environment of other economies. Doing&#13;
      Business 2012, a joint report of the IFC and World Bank, analyzes business regulation across 183 economies, focus-&#13;
      ing on ten areas that affect the life-cycle of domestic SMEs. The report ranks these economies on a scale of 1 to&#13;
      183, with 1 being the most business-friendly. While Doing Business does not capture all aspects of the business&#13;
      environment that matter to firms â&#128;&#148; aspects such as security, macroeconomic stability and corruption â&#128;&#148; the rankings&#13;
      provide a rough guide to which countries are business-friendly, and which are not. The scores on specific areas of&#13;
      business regulation are also helpful in revealing regulatory bottlenecks, such as large numbers of procedures, long&#13;
      delays or high cost. Thus, Doing Business identifies areas where practical changes can be made to directly improve&#13;
      the business environment.&#13;

30 | Russian Economic Report. â&#132;&#150; 27. April 2012&#13;
&amp;#12;Box 6. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2012 Doing Business ranking (continued)&#13;
     Russia ranked 120 out of the 183 economies assessed in the Doing Business 2012 report. This rank-&#13;
ing suggests that the regulatory environment in Russia is, on average, less business-friendly than other countries&#13;
(Figure 37). Russia does better in some areas than in others. In areas such as enforcing contracts, registering&#13;
property, and resolving insolvencies, Russia has implemented business-friendly regulation, and as a result scores&#13;
well on the global index. However, in other areas, such as getting electricity, dealing with construction permits and&#13;
trading across borders, regulation continues to be an extremely complicated and costly affair. As an example, it takes&#13;
423 days and costs 184 percent of income per capita to complete the 51 procedures needed to open a warehouse.&#13;
Similarly, obtaining a new electricity connection (Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s lowest score) requires 10 procedures, takes 281 days and&#13;
costs 1,852 percent of per capita income to complete. These are clearly areas where regulation meant to protect the&#13;
public is being administered inefficiently, placing excessive time and cost constraints on business.&#13;

    SMEs have a more difficult time doing business in Russia than in peer economies. Compared to high-&#13;
income OECD countries and EU emerging economies, Russia is competitive in enforcing contracts. When compared&#13;
to other emerging economies though, Russia fares better, ranking higher in areas of registering property, paying&#13;
taxes, and resolving insolvencies. In other areas of business regulation, however, Russia lacks a competitive advan-&#13;
tage (Figure 38). For example, it still takes nearly a year longer to deal with a construction permit and several hundred&#13;
U.S. dollars more to export a container in Russia than in other countries in the region. And each procedure needed&#13;
to obtain a new electricity connection â&#128;&#148; and there are many â&#128;&#148; takes an average of 28 days to complete in Russia,&#13;
compared with just 10 days in India and six days in Brazil.&#13;

&amp;#12;   Box 6. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2012 Doing Business ranking (continued)&#13;
        The Doing Business 2012 report finds that Russia improved in nine of the ten indicators measured by&#13;
   Doing Business since 2004, although its overall ranking remains low. Biggest improvements have been made&#13;
   in the areas of dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes. In keeping with this trend, Russia&#13;
   made it easier for domestic entrepreneurs in 2010â&#128;&#147;2011, rising in the global rankings from 124 to 120. This rise was&#13;
   largely due to the fact that Russia implemented four business regulation reforms last year, the highest ever recorded&#13;
   in a single year. This year Russia made it easier to:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Enforce contracts, by introducing a new electronic court case filing system;&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Transfer property, by eliminating the requirement to obtain cadastral passports on land plots;&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Import, by reducing the number of documents needed for import transactions;&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Afford electricity, but cutting the cost of getting a new electrical connection in half.&#13;
&#13;
        It is important to look at regional differences in business regulation as well. Doing Business looks exclu-&#13;
   sively at regulation affecting SMEs that operate in Moscow, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s main business centre. However, regulations&#13;
   vary across countries. In order to capture regional differences within Russia, a sub-national Doing Business report,&#13;
   the second of its kind, will be published this June. This report will rank 30 Russian regions on ease of doing business,&#13;
   and provide recommendations to improve performance at the local level.&#13;

WTO Accession: A Unique and Important Opportunity&#13;
           for Economic Development&#13;
&#13;
After 18 years of negotiations, Russia successfully negotiated the terms of its accession to the World Trade&#13;
Organization. We estimate large and broad based gains to Russia from the accession. In the medium term, the&#13;
gains should be about 3 percent of GDP per year with wages rising 4â&#128;&#148;5 percent and more than 99 percent of the&#13;
households gaining income. In the long run, the gains should be about 11 percent of Russian GDP per year with&#13;
wages rising about 13-17 percent. Russia has committed to maximum tariffs such that the un-weighted average&#13;
Most Favored Nation (MFN) â&#128;&#156;boundâ&#128;&#157; ( or maximum) tariff will equal 8.2 percent after all commitments are&#13;
implemented. But the un-weighted average applied MFN tariff will equal only 7.6 percent, because there will&#13;
be many tariff lines where the Russian tariffs will be applied at less than the maximum limit required by its&#13;
WTO commitments. This compares to an average un-weighted applied MFN tariff of Russia of 11 percent in&#13;
2011. Despite the tariff reductions, the majority of sectors will increase proï¬&#129;tability and competitiveness due to&#13;
lowered input costs (especially services inputs) and increased prices for exports. For sectors where workers may&#13;
be displaced, appropriate government policy is to focus on assisting with the adjustment of displaced workers by&#13;
providing resources for retraining and relocation of displaced workers to higher wage jobsâ&#128;&#148;as opposed to subsi-&#13;
dizing declining sectors and delaying the adjustment to a more productive economy. In order to achieve strong&#13;
growth, it would be important to leverage the beneï¬&#129;ts that will be achieved from reforms as part of the WTO&#13;
accession package with further steps to improve the investment, business and regulatory climate. Diversiï¬&#129;cation,&#13;
modernization and growth will be all the stronger if WTO accession is complemented with improvements in the&#13;
business climate for all ï¬&#129;rms doing business in Russia, Russian and foreign.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
     On December 16, 2011, during its Ministerial meetings in Geneva, the World Trade&#13;
Organization (WTO) formally accepted the offer of Russia and invited Russia to join the WTO.&#13;
Russia will have until mid July 20124 to ratify the accession agreement and will become a member 30&#13;
days after it notiï¬&#129;es the WTO of its ratiï¬&#129;cation. If their legislatures adopt the accession agreement,&#13;
the Russian Federation, Montenegro and Samoa will become the 155th , 156th and 157th members of&#13;
the WTO. Spanning more than 18 years, the Russian accession negotiations were the longest in the&#13;
history of the WTO; and the Working Party on accession of Russia to the WTO was the largest such&#13;
Working Party in the history of the WTO. Trade among the WTO members represented 97 percent&#13;
of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s trade turnover, including over 94 percent of the foodstuffs in recent years. Russia has&#13;
been, by far, the largest economy in the world that is not a member of the WTO.&#13;
     WTO accession is a comprehensive process that involves much more than commitments on tar-&#13;
iffs on goods. WTO accession will impact on a wide range of policies and institutions, including tariff&#13;
policy, customs administration, rules for using safety standards on goods in a non-protective manner,&#13;
rights of market access and national treatment for foreign providers of services, rules for the treatment&#13;
of foreign investors in goods, constraints on trade distorting agricultural subsidies, intellectual prop-&#13;
erty, rules requiring transparency in the foreign trade regime and even government procurement.5&#13;
The process brings government decision-makers from the highest levels into the decision-making and&#13;
represents a time for evaluation of a very wide range of regulations. It represents an opportunity to&#13;
implement important trade, foreign direct investment and institutional changes, and therefore acces-&#13;
sion is a crucial tool for economic development.&#13;
4   More precisely, the deadline for notiï¬&#129;cation of the ratiï¬&#129;cation is 220 days from the invitation date of December 16, 2011.&#13;
5   The Report of the Working Party on Accession of Russia is a 758 page document, plus two addendums for the schedules of&#13;
    speciï¬&#129;c commitments on services (73 pages) and goods (a large Excel ï¬&#129;le that covers commitments on thousands of tariff&#13;
    lines in the customs code of the Russian Federation).&#13;
&#13;
      III. World Trade Organization Accession: A Unique and Important Opportunity for Economic Development | 33&#13;
&amp;#12;     This note summarizes the key results of a series of studies supported by the World Bank to&#13;
estimate the impact of Russian WTO accession on real GDP, wages, household incomes and pov-&#13;
erty, regional incomes, industrial sector impacts and other key economic indicators. These studies&#13;
employed computable general equilibrium models of the Russian economy.6 The World Bank has also&#13;
assessed the impact of changes in Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tariff regime in recent years and has recently calculated the&#13;
impact of commitments to the WTO on the applied tariffs.7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimates of the World Bank team of the gains in real GDP, wages,&#13;
household income, and regional impacts&#13;
     We estimate that in the medium term, Russia should gain about 3.3 percent per year of the&#13;
value of Russian GDP (or about $49 billion per year based on 2010 GDP at market exchange rates).&#13;
In the long term, when the positive impact on the investment climate is incorporated, the gains&#13;
should increase to about 11 percent per year of the value of Russian GDP (or about $162 billion per&#13;
year at 2010 market exchange rates). These are estimated gains that will repeat each year, i.e., they&#13;
are not a one-time gain (Jensen, Rutherford and Tarr, 2007). Based on the econometric estimates of the&#13;
gains from an open economy trade regime, these estimated gains are very plausible.8&#13;
     The average Russian household would experience a gain of 7.2 percent of its income each&#13;
year, with more than 99 percent of Russian households experiencing gains within the range of 2 to&#13;
25 percent of their incomes each year. Skilled and unskilled workers wages are estimated to increase&#13;
by about ï¬&#129;ve and four percent, respectively in the medium run and by about 17 and 13 percent in the&#13;
long run. Skilled labor and urban households should gain relatively more than average due to the&#13;
increase in foreign direct investment in the skill intensive business services sectors. Rich households&#13;
should gain less than the average household, since increased competition from foreign direct invest-&#13;
ment results in capital gaining less than labor. The poorest households are estimated to gain at about&#13;
the level of the average household, thereby reducing poverty, (Rutherford and Tarr, 2008).&#13;

8 A welfare increase of 3.3 percent of GDP is quite plausible in the context of the estimated gains from trade liberalization&#13;
&#13;
  from econometric studies. First, Rutherford and Tarr (2002) have shown that a permanent increase of between 0.4 percent&#13;
  and one percent in the growth rate of an economy corresponds to a welfare increase of between 10 and 35 percent. Sachs&#13;
  and Warner (1995) estimate that open economies have grown about 2.45 percent faster than closed economies, with even&#13;
  greater differences for open versus closed economies among developing countries. They note that trade liberalization is&#13;
  often accompanied by macro stabilization and other market reforms, and their open economy variable can be picking up&#13;
  these other effects as well. But they argue that trade liberalization is the sine qua non of the overall reform process, because&#13;
  other interventions such as state subsidies often are unsustainable in an open economy. While similar results were found&#13;
  in studies by Edwards (1993) and Dollar (1992), Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) criticized all these studies, in part because&#13;
  of their failure to account for simultaneity bias. However, Frankel and Romer (1999) have shown that adjusting for the&#13;
  simultaneity bias in cross country regression studies such as Sachs and Warner does not reduce the estimated impact&#13;
  of openness on growth. More recently, using time series data on individual countries, rather than cross-country growth&#13;
  regressions, Wacziarg and Welch (2009) ï¬&#129;nd compelling evidence that countries grow about 1.5 percentage points faster&#13;
  after they liberalized trade.&#13;
     Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi (2004) and Bolaky and Freund (2008) have highlighted the importance of good institu-&#13;
  tions to economic growth. Bolaky and Freund have shown that in 25% of the countries with the worst business and labor&#13;
  regulations, open trade can harm growth. On the other hand, for the 75% of the countries with the best business and labor&#13;
  regulations, open trade has an even stronger beneï¬&#129;cial impact on growth than previous authors have found. But Dollar and&#13;
  Kraay (2003) ï¬&#129;nd evidence that trade is more important than institutions in the medium terms; and Rodrik, Subramanian&#13;
  and Trebbi have shown that trade liberalization can improve institutions while Ades and di Tella (1999) ï¬&#129;nd evidence that&#13;
  increased trade leads to reduced corruption. For full citations of the references in this footnote as well as additional consid-&#13;

&amp;#12;     All regions should gain substantially, but the regions that will gain the most are those that are&#13;
most successful at attracting foreign direct investment, which depends on both location advantages&#13;
and creating a good investment climate. The regions likely to gain the most are the Northwest, Saint&#13;
Petersburg and Far East regions, (Rutherford and Tarr, 2010).&#13;
     In a focused study of the telecommunications sector, the authors estimated that skilled wor-&#13;
kers wages in the telecom sector will increase substantially from foreign direct investment (FDI).&#13;
Multinational ï¬&#129;rms that locate in Russia employ mostly Russians and will increase the demand and&#13;
wages for Russians with the skills needed in their companies. Russian ï¬&#129;rms that become part of joint&#13;
ventures with foreign investors will likely preserve or increase the value of their investments; but&#13;
Russian capital owners in the telecom sector who remain wholly independent of multinational ï¬&#129;rms&#13;
will likely see the value of their investments decline. Households dependent on income from these&#13;
types of ï¬&#129;rms may lose from WTO accession (Jensen, Rutherford and Tarr, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What are the sources of these estimated gains?&#13;
&#13;
     About 72 percent of the estimated gains come from improved quality and lower prices of ser-&#13;
vices that lead to productivity increases and increased competitiveness of Russian ï¬&#129;rms using these&#13;
better services. Crucially, ï¬&#129;rms and consumers will have access to more and better services from&#13;
increased FDI in business services. Increased productivity means that real wages should increase and&#13;
prices should declineâ&#128;&#148;beneï¬&#129;ting consumers and lowering cost of production for ï¬&#129;rms.&#13;
Tariff reductions will allow purchase of intermediate inputs and ï¬&#129;nal goods of consumers at lower prices,&#13;
accounting for 18 percent of the estimated gains. Although many sectors in Russia are characterized by&#13;
imperfect competition, international evidence is strong that prices decline in response to trade liberalization.&#13;
Even imperfectly competitive ï¬&#129;rms reduce prices in response to increased competition.9 Tariff reduction will&#13;
make it easier to import products that contain modern and diverse technologies.&#13;
     Improved market access for Russian exporters accounts for the remaining 10 percent of the&#13;
estimated gains. Russian ï¬&#129;rms that have been subject to antidumping actions in export markets, such&#13;
as Russian steel producers, non-ferrous metal producers and chemical exporters, will have increased&#13;
legal rights to protect their commercial interests in antidumping cases.&#13;
&#13;
Sector impacts and Adjustment Assistance&#13;
&#13;
     Many sectors will expand despite tariff reductions due to input price declines, improved qual-&#13;
ity of services inputs and export price increases. Which sectors expand or contract depends on the&#13;
interaction of several impacts. On the negative side, the reduction of import tariffs will lead to a reduc-&#13;
tion of prices for sales in Russia, which will negatively impact proï¬&#129;ts and output. But the increased&#13;
demand for imports will depreciate the real exchange rate, so import prices and prices in Russia will&#13;
decline by less than the tariff reduction, putting less negative pressure on Russian industry. On the&#13;
positive side, the cost of intermediate inputs to Russian industry will decline for two reasons. First,&#13;
prices of intermediate inputs will decline due to the tariff decreases. Second, better quality and diverse&#13;
services and goods will be available that will increase productivity and further lower the quality&#13;
adjusted cost of intermediate goods and services. Exporting ï¬&#129;rms will receive higher price for exports&#13;
in rubles due to real exchange rate depreciation. And for ï¬&#129;rms subject to antidumping actions, WTO&#13;
membership means that they will have better rights in export markets to defend themselves in anti-&#13;
dumping cases.&#13;
     Export intensive sectors such as non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals and chemicals will beneï¬&#129;t&#13;
from higher export prices in rubles and are the industrial sectors that are most likely to expand.&#13;
The export intensive sectors beneï¬&#129;t from higher prices of exports in rubles from real exchange rate&#13;
depreciation and from better protection of their rights in antidumping cases. These sectors are also&#13;
among those whose costs of production decline the most due to more intensive use of inputs whose&#13;
prices decline.&#13;
     Many services sectors that will be more open to foreign direct investment (FDI) will also&#13;
expand production, such as telecommunications, banking and insurance. Foreign ï¬&#129;rms that invest&#13;

&amp;#12;and produce in Russia will employ predominantly Russian workers. The experience of the Chinese&#13;
insurance sector in instructive in this regard. Despite great fears of a contraction in the Chinese insur-&#13;
ance industry, there was a large expansion. Salaries of skilled workers in the Chinese insurance sector,&#13;
such as statisticians and actuaries, increased substantially after WTO accession. Even domestic insur-&#13;
ance ï¬&#129;rms in the Chinese insurance sector doubled as foreign ï¬&#129;rms sought Chinese companies as joint&#13;
venture partners. Sectors that have relatively high tariffs and export little, such as the food industry,&#13;
light industry, machinery and equipment and construction materials are the sectors that are likely to&#13;
experience the greatest competitive pressure and may reduce output.&#13;
      For workers facing displacement from increased import competition, it is better for the govern-&#13;
ment to provide assistance to workers to retrain or relocate, while avoiding support to industries.&#13;
It is important to focus on the displaced workers, not the sectors. In the absence of a general effective&#13;
social safety net to assist displaced workers (the ï¬&#129;rst best policy tool), a well designed program of trade&#13;
adjustment assistance could be effective. For example, the United States has had a trade adjustment&#13;
assistance program for more than 35 years. The European Union introduced the â&#128;&#156;European Global&#13;
Adjustment Fundâ&#128;&#157; in 2006 and South Korea recently introduced a similar program in anticipation of&#13;
possible free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.10 These programs assist&#13;
workers to obtain training and with relocation expenses to move to the expanding sectors where the&#13;
wages are rising. Subsidizing the declining sectors to avoid any output contraction defeats the liberal-&#13;
ization and denies the potentially expanding sectors the needed additional workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
By 2020, applied Most-Favored Nation11 tariffs of the Russian Federation&#13;
will fall by at least 30 percent&#13;
&#13;
      Table 1 shows the applied average â&#128;&#156;most favored nationâ&#128;&#157; (MFN) tariff rates of Russiaon an&#13;
annual basis from 2001 until 2011 and the projected impact of the commitments to the WTO on&#13;
the tariff rates between 2012 and 2020. The tariff commitments of Russiato the WTO are staged, with&#13;
transition periods for implementation of the tariff cuts for the more sensitive sectors. The ï¬&#129;nal tariff&#13;
cuts will not be implemented until eight years after accession to the WTO.12 The average applied MFN&#13;
tariff is calculated both on a simple average (un-weighted average) basis and on a trade weighted&#13;
average basis.13&#13;
&#13;
10 Trade adjustment assistance must be well designed, however, or it is likely to be ineffective. Monetary compensation and&#13;
   retraining in the early years of the US program were found to be ineffective since the assistance was not well targeted&#13;
   at truly displaced workers. The effectiveness of retraining assistance tends to be more effective if it is driven by demand&#13;
   from the private sector, such as with subsidized apprentice programs as opposed to government sponsored training. In&#13;
   Hungary, Oâ&#128;&#153;Leary (1997) found that unemployed workers that participated in retraining programs had a slightly better&#13;
   chance of becoming employed, received slightly better wages on re-employment, and had a longer duration of employ-&#13;
   ment after ï¬&#129;nding a job. Decker and Corson report that participation in a training program in the US for trade displaced&#13;
   workers increased the earning of trainees. For a review of the program of the United States see Paul Decker and Walter&#13;
   Corson (1995), â&#128;&#156;International Trade and Worker Displacement: Evaluation of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program,â&#128;&#157;&#13;

11 The â&#128;&#156;Most Favored Nationâ&#128;&#157; tariff principle means that any WTO member will be treated as well as the most favored na-&#13;
&#13;
   tion. For example, if Japan offers a tariff of 5 percent on some kind of machine to the United States, then Russian exporters&#13;
   and exporters of all other WTO member countries, will also face a tariff no higher than ï¬&#129;ve percent on their exports of the&#13;
   machine to Japan. Customs unions and free trade agreements, as well as tariff preferences for developing countries, are&#13;
   major exceptions to the MFN principle.&#13;
12 Calculation of the Russian tariff structure is complicated by the fact out of the more than 11,000 tariff lines in the Russian&#13;
&#13;
   tariff code, there were about 2,000 that used the so called â&#128;&#156;combinedâ&#128;&#157; tariff system in 2011. For the combined system tariff&#13;
   lines, the actual tariff applied by Russian customs is the maximum of the ad valorem or speciï¬&#129;c tariff. (For footwear it is&#13;
   the sum of the ad valorem and speciï¬&#129;c tariff.) To assess the changes in the tariff structure, it is necessary to ï¬&#129;rst calculate&#13;
   the ad valorem equivalents of the speciï¬&#129;c tariff component of the 2000 tariff lines with speciï¬&#129;c tariffs.&#13;
13 For the years 2011 through 2020, we have used the latest data available for the calculations of trade weightsâ&#128;&#148;namely the&#13;
&#13;
   trade data of 2010.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     At least in terms of the overall averages, the Customs Union tariff had very little impact on tar-&#13;
iffs of the Russian Federation. As of July 1, 2010, the customs code of the Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan&#13;
Customs Union became the customs code of the three member countries, with some exceptions,&#13;
mostly in Kazakhstan.14 The impact of imposing the Customs Union tariff code is measured by the&#13;
differences in the tariffs between the years 2010 and 2011.&#13;
     By the year 2020, tariffs will fall from an 11 percent average in 2011 to 7.6 percent on a simple&#13;
average basis. The trade weighted average tariff, however, falls more substantially from 11.6 per-&#13;
cent in 2011 to 5.4 percent in 2020. The WTO commitments are progressively implemented beginning&#13;
in the year 2012, with almost all commitments implemented by 2017 or 2018. The greater drop in the&#13;
trade weighted average is due signiï¬&#129;cantly to substantial cuts in the tariffs in the automotive sector&#13;
(from 19.2 to 7.7 percent) and in electrical equipment and machinery sector (from 8.1 to 4.9 percent).&#13;
Together imports of these two sectors constitute more than 25 percent of the value of total imports of&#13;
the Russian Federation. It is possible, however, that as a result of the Russian automobile program,&#13;
designed to increase Russian production of automobiles and automobile parts, that imports in the&#13;
automobile sector will decline in the future. If so, the trade weighted average tariff will not fall as&#13;
sharply when based on the actual trade weights of the future. For further details see Shepotylo and&#13;
Tarr (2008; 2012).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;boundâ&#128;&#157; or maximum average un-weighted MFN tariff of Russia&#13;
will be 8.2 percent after all commitments are implementedâ&#128;&#148;higher than&#13;
the projected average applied tariffs&#13;
&#13;
      On over 1500 tariff lines, the current applied tariff of Russia is less than the ï¬&#129;nal â&#128;&#156;boundâ&#128;&#157; rate&#13;
under the commitments of Russia to the WTO. Countries may apply tariffs at rates less than their&#13;
â&#128;&#156;boundâ&#128;&#157; maximum rates.15 Assuming the applied tariffs are not increased, the average â&#128;&#156;boundâ&#128;&#157; MFN&#13;
tariff of Russian 2020 will be higher than the average applied MFN tariff of 7.6 percent (Table 11).&#13;
Consequently, unless applied tariff rates are increased, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tariffs will be 0.6 percentage points&#13;
lower (on an un-weighted basis) than required by the WTO commitments.&#13;

   409 tariff lines. See World Bank (2012), Assessment of Costs and Beneï¬&#129;ts of the Customs Union for Kazakhstan, Report No.&#13;
   65977-KZ, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit, Europe and Central Asia Region.&#13;
15 The WTO Secretariat estimated that the bound tariffs of Russia will be 7.8 percent in 2020. While our estimates are close,&#13;
&#13;
   they are slightly higher for two reasons. Due to data limitations, the WTO statistical ofï¬&#129;ce had to calculate tariff averages&#13;
   based on aggregated categories, rather than at the â&#128;&#156;ten digitâ&#128;&#157; tariff line level of the tariff schedule of the Russian Federa-&#13;
   tion. We had the more detailed ten digit data available, which allows more accurate calculations. Further, also due to data&#13;
   limitations, the WTO calculations ignored speciï¬&#129;c tariffs on more than 200 tariff lines where the speciï¬&#129;c tariffs and the&#13;
   import data were in different units. We obtained a concordance in such cases and estimated the tariff equivalents of the&#13;
   speciï¬&#129;c tariffs for all ten digit tariff lines.&#13;

     760 of the total tariff lines with applied MFN tariffs less than WTO bound tariff levels are&#13;
in the machinery and mechanical appliances and electrical machinery and equipment categories&#13;
(2-digit categories 84 and 85). Notable examples at the ten digit tariff line level are the following.&#13;
Over $ 2 billion in three ten digit categories of auto parts entered with a zero import tariff in 2010 in&#13;
the Customs Union, while the bound rate at the WTO for these categories was either ï¬&#129;ve or ï¬&#129;fteen&#13;
percent.16 Over $1 billion in electricity turbo-generators (ten digit code 8502292000) entered in 2010&#13;
with a Customs Union tariff of zero, while the WTO bound rate is ï¬&#129;ve percent.&#13;

Russia has made a comprehensive offer that is typical of the commitments&#13;

&#13;
     The agreement between Russia and the WTO is a comprehensive offer from Russia for mem-&#13;
bership that has satisï¬&#129;ed the members of the Working Party, but is not unusual. The offer is typi-&#13;
cal of the agreements of the countries that have acceded to the WTO that are not â&#128;&#156;Least Developed&#13;
Countries (LDC).â&#128;&#157; Among the Transition countries, only Latvia (9.4 percent) and China (9.1 percent)&#13;
acceded with a higher average bound tariff than the 8.2 percent tariff commitment of the Russian&#13;
Federation. All other Transition countries acceded with average tariffs bound at levels between&#13;
4.8 percent and 7.5 percent, with most in the range of 5.5 percent to 6.6 percent.&#13;
     Russia has made substantial commitments to market access and national treatment of for-&#13;
eign providers of services, which are typical of non-LDC countries acceding to the WTO. Russia&#13;
has made commitments in 116 services sub-sectors. Examples include: the quota on the maximum&#13;
share of foreign banks or insurance companies has been increased from 15 percent to 50 percent&#13;
of the market. Branches of foreign insurance companies will be allowed nine years after accession.&#13;
In telecoms, the 49 percent maximum foreign equity restriction will be removed four years after&#13;
accession. The monopoly restriction on ï¬&#129;xed-line long distance telephone services within Russia has&#13;
already been removed. National treatment and market access will be provided for a wide variety&#13;
of professions (such as lawyers and accountants), and for wholesale and retail trade and courier&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Russian negotiators succeeded in preserving protection of some sensitive sectors&#13;
and obtaining substantial adjustment periods&#13;
&#13;
     Russia succeeded in its negotiating objective of protecting some sensitive sectors. For example,&#13;
a major objective of the Russian negotiators was to avoid a commitment to accept branches of foreign&#13;
banks. Despite the fact that all non-LDC countries that have acceded to the WTO have made a com-&#13;
mitment to accept branches of foreign banks on their territory, 18 the Russian negotiators succeeded&#13;
in their objectives of allowing only subsidiaries. The Russian automobile program requires the use&#13;
of minimum shares of Russian local content and imposes minimum production requirements on for-&#13;
eign investors in order to obtain preferential tariff treatment on imported inputs. These constraints&#13;
on foreign investors in goods are considered violations of the Trade Related Investment Measures&#13;
(TRIMs) agreement of the WTO. Russia succeeded obtaining a transition period of six years before it&#13;
is obligated to terminate these rules on foreign investors in autos. By that time, a substantial increase&#13;
in Russian auto assembly and parts production should be in placeâ&#128;&#148;so the negotiated transition period&#13;
for Russia was very important. There are also substantial transition periods built into implementation&#13;
of the tariff commitments on goods, with bound tariff levels for some products becoming effective&#13;
only seven or eight years after accession.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion: A Unique and Important Opportunity&#13;
for Economic Development&#13;
      WTO accession is a unique and important opportunity to move the country forward toward&#13;
an outward-looking model of economic development. As Russia seeks to diversify and modernize&#13;
its economy, how will it achieve its objectives? The studies cited above indicate that Russia will reap&#13;
substantial gains from WTO accession and that the beneï¬&#129;ts are widespread and will reduce poverty.&#13;
The examples of fast growth or â&#128;&#156;development miraclesâ&#128;&#157; in the past half century, such as South Korea,&#13;
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan (China), Chile, China and Mauritius, were all countries whose rapid&#13;
growth was led by export growth. Import tariffs, however, act as a tax on exports and impede the&#13;
movement toward and open economy or export led model of economic development. In a business as&#13;
usual scenario, concentrated forces who want protection in their sectors will lobby to defeat liberaliza-&#13;
tion, while there are many who gain from liberalization, the gains are not concentrated and typically&#13;
they do not lobby for liberalization. The uneven lobbying often leads to excessive protection compared&#13;
to what is beneï¬&#129;cial for the country. WTO accession involves foreign business interests and foreign&#13;
governments in the negotiations on the level of home protection. Then policy-makers at the highest&#13;
levels of government must engage in the process, and the result is usually a broader and deeper set of&#13;
reforms than could be achieved without the accession process. Ratiï¬&#129;cation by Russia for the Protocol&#13;
on its Accession to the WTO would thus be an important step in reform of the Russian economy. It&#13;
would be important to leverage the beneï¬&#129;ts that will be achieved from reforms as part of the WTO&#13;
accession package with further steps to improve the investment and business climate. Diversiï¬&#129;cation,&#13;
modernization and growth will be all the stronger if WTO accession is complemented with improve-&#13;
ments in the business climate for all ï¬&#129;rms doing business in Russia, Russian and foreign.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Half a year ago, Russia's economic
            prospects looked uncertain. The global economy was losing
            momentum, the expansion in the euro area was grinding to a
            halt and commodity prices were beginning to fall. Yet, while
            output growth is slowing this year in line with weaker
            growth in Europe and elsewhere, Russia's latest economy
            performance has been solid, though aided by favorable oil
            prices. The economy returned to the pre-crisis peak towards
            the end of last year, supported by strong consumption, as
            growth held steady at the same rate as in 2010. In 2011,
            measured in current dollars, Russia's economy was the
            ninth biggest in the world, compared to the eleventh biggest
            in 2007. This year, Russia's output might exceed US$2
            trillion. Equalizing for prices difference with purchasing
            power parity, Russia's economy is already the sixth
            biggest today. The current account looks strong thanks to a
            large surplus in the trade balance, and the Central Bank of
            Russia added again in 2011 to its stock of foreign reserves.
            Employment returned to pre-crisis levels even earlier than
            output, and wages grew at a solid pace. Inflation reached
            its lowest level in two decades. Inequality declined and
            consumption levels of low-income households improved. The
            fiscal balance returned to a surplus. And while average
            public debt levels in advanced economies exceeded 100
            percent of growth domestic product (GDP) in 2011,
            Russia's public debt was no more than 10 percent of
            GDP. Economic policies can help to shore up Russia's
            resilience in a volatile economic environment, diversify its
            economy, and strengthen its growth potential. First, fiscal
            policy should be used to rebuild fiscal buffers while oil
            prices are high. This will not only help to prepare for the
            next crisis, but also make sure that fiscal policy does not
            become procyclical as the output gap closes. Furthermore,
            monetary policy should continue to focus on low inflation,
            and financial policies on strengthening oversight. Finally,
            removing structural barriers to growth can help to bolster
            investment and productivity. Improving the business
            environment will go a long way to make the most of the
            economic benefits of Russia's World Trade Organization
            accession in summer 2012.
