Interviewer:                  Robert W. Oliver&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER: This is July 14, 1986&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Bastille Day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: Bastille Day, yes. We should be out in the streets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: This is Robert Oliver. I'm about to interview Shirley Boskey about her experiences in the&#13;
Bank. I wonder if we might begin our conversation by your saying a bit about how you happened to&#13;
come to the Bank in the first place, what you were doing before you came to the Bank, and then tell&#13;
some of the major things that you remember about your experiences in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: I came to the Bank from about nine years in the United States Government. I was then in&#13;
the Interior Department in the Office of Territories, which is an odd juxtaposition in itself. The&#13;
Territories are exterior to the Government, but they are consigned to the Interior Department. I was&#13;
Assistant General Counsel of the Office of Territories. I came to the Bank in part because of the&#13;
change of Administration in the U.S. I had had a reasonably prominent position, at least in the sense&#13;
of going up to the Hill and testifying, and the new Republican Administration was of the view that if&#13;
you were visible before you should be less visible once they began, and they tended to reverse what was&#13;
done just for the sake of reversing. Now, we'd probably been wrong a lot of the time, so the reversal&#13;
was useful, but I didn't care for the rationalization.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
  So I got pretty restless where I was, and I looked around for something else to do. I knew Dick&#13;
[Richard H.) Demuth. I knew he was working at the World Bank. I didn't have a notion of what the&#13;
Bank was about, and I had a terrible sense of geography, but I thought this would be something&#13;
completely new and different and I would try. And it happened that Dick at that point was minus an&#13;
assistant in the department. Somebody who had been there had left. It wasn't in the Legal&#13;
Department, and that's what I might have hoped to shift to. But Dick was a lawyer, and at least one,&#13;
maybe two other persons in his department were lawyers. And he said, "Come along and try." It&#13;
seemed a good idea, so I did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And it was a shock. It was so different from what I had known before. We were not working with&#13;
the Hill. In the Interior Department, I was constantly producing material under time pressure,&#13;
especially on statehood--this was before Alaska and Hawaii had become states. I was writing speeches&#13;
for Congressmen and working on legislation, doing a lot of drafting, a lot of writing. However, Dick&#13;
wanted writing done, so that fitted in too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But I will tell you how it was brought home to me very early in my stint at the Bank that I had&#13;
shifted. Our offices were on the same floor as those of the Bank President, then Mr. [Eugene R.)&#13;
Black. And in the first week that I was in the Bank I happened to get in an elevator--rather he got into&#13;
an elevator I was already in, at the end of the day. And he took off the homburg that he always wore&#13;
and said, 'Good evening,' and realized he had not seen me before, and he said, "Where are you from?"&#13;
Well, I answered the question just as I would have at a Government meeting a few weeks earlier when&#13;
I would have arrived in a room with Treasury and State and Agriculture people. And I just said,&#13;
without thinking, "Interior." And Mr. Black said, "The interior of what?" And then I realized that I was&#13;
no longer a U.S. Government employee but an international civil servant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you have a quick and ready reply?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: rm afraid all I did was laugh, and I think I was saved by the fact that we were in an elevator&#13;
which by then had probably reached the ground floor. No. I tried afterward to have quick, or at least&#13;
ready, replies for the questions that he asked, but by that time they had gotten onto a more&#13;
professional level. I really don't remember what I said. I was so startled by the realization.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Before we go on with your career in the Bank, this leads me to ask a question about&#13;
personalities of the Presidents. A number of people have told me that one of the reasons the staff was&#13;
very fond of Mr. Black was because he did speak to people in the elevators. He did go to ballgames&#13;
where the staff was sponsoring a section, that sort of thing, but that subsequent Presidents were not&#13;
quite as friendly, so to speak, in this informal manner. Is there anything you can add to this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: I think that's a fair comment. I'll tell you something else Mr. Black did. In those days the&#13;
Bank had a bowling league. I think, in fact, it still does, but it was quite small then, and Mr. Black&#13;
came to award the prizes every year. Not a thing which you might think a Bank President would do.&#13;
At the end of the year there was always a big party and Mr. Black came, made a little speech,&#13;
recognized everybody. Yes, he was a very approachable President.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I knew Mr.(George D.] Woods--well, now I wouldn't say I knew him well, but well enough. I think&#13;
he was probably reasonably approachable. I remember one year at the Annual Meeting, when Dick&#13;
and I used to write the reply that the President gives. You know, he makes a set speech which is&#13;
circulated in advance at the opening of the Annual Meeting, and then he speaks again at the&#13;
conclusion. And while some of themes at the conclusion may be decided upon in advance, it is&#13;
supposed to represent--to reflect, that is--comments, speeches that have been made in the course of the&#13;
Annual Meeting. So it's written, really and truly, not like the corporate minutes done up in advance but&#13;
really written at the end. And we used to try to put some, oh, literary touches in. Not wildly literary,&#13;
but something. And I remember once getting into an elevator--aU my recollections of Bank Presidents&#13;
seem to relate to elevators; I hope you're not going to try to get a Freudian analysis of this--but I was in&#13;
an elevator with Mr. Woods up at the Shoreham Hotel at an Annual Meeting, and he introduced me to&#13;
somebody by saying, ''This is Mrs. Boskey. She's my poet.' Meaning that I had put something or other&#13;
in his concluding remarks that year, but that was a fairly good illustration of the rather friendly and&#13;
informal relationship I had with him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Once I remember I went up, probably in Dick's absence, to talk to him about something or other.&#13;
He proposed taking some action, and I must have gotten a dubious look on my face because he&#13;
&amp;#12;     BOSKEY                                               -4-&#13;
..&#13;
&#13;
     [BOSKEY]&#13;
     said, "I know. You're thinking that I should take it up with the President's Council frrst." And that was&#13;
     in fact what I was thinking, though I hadn't said it. At least I hadn't said it yet. He said, "All right, I&#13;
     will." It was pleasant and friendly, and I really never had any complaints about him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Now, Mr. [Robert S.) McNamara. Well, he did hold to himself. He didn't eat in the dining room,&#13;
     for example. And I know he was thought of as not approachable, and you will have many staff, I'm&#13;
     sure, say that in all the years--5 years, 10 years, whatever it was--that they were in the Bank they never&#13;
     saw or they never spoke to Mr. McNamara. You couldn't meet him in the elevator, because he ran&#13;
     upstairs. He literally did. He started on the frrst floor, and he went up the stairs to his office. I&#13;
     discovered that once because I used to arrive at the Bank very early, as he did. And sometimes we&#13;
     even had conversations out on the street. On the 19th Street side. Then I once sent him a memo&#13;
     saying, "As we agreed in your outdoor office," and went on with what he had agreed just to remind him&#13;
     that he had said it. But sometimes when I came in after him, I could see him go into the building, and&#13;
     when I got to the elevator, he wasn't there. I went around the comer to see if there was a private&#13;
     elevator, and there isn't. And I only discovered what he had done when coming in ahead of him, I got&#13;
     up to the 12th floor to deliver something to [Ernest) Stem's office and I saw him emerge from the&#13;
     stairweU. He had gone upstairs on foot. That was his morning exercise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: And he had made it almost as fast as the elevator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: As fast as--exactly. He didn't stop and catch his breath, I think.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Can I just add for the tape since you've talked about dining in the dining room. This very&#13;
     day when you and I were having lunch in the dining room, Mr. [Barber] Conable came in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Yes, and I have heard that in the short time he's been here he's already eaten in the&#13;
     cafeteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          But to go back to Mr. McNamara. He moved very fast too. I was once him at the United Nations,&#13;
     and he had, after some intense persuasion, spoken to a committee there. I mean persuasion from&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
his staff, including me. He was going straight back to Washington. Alii did was stop to pick up a&#13;
briefcase with extra copies of papers we had circulated. So I was really only a few minutes--seconds,&#13;
perhaps--behind him. By the time I got out of the UN building he was already across the plaza. I don't&#13;
know if you know the UN building in New York.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It is set back quite far from the street. He was across the plaza. He got in a taxi, and I&#13;
could have gotten another taxi, I think, but I was going back to Washington, too. The door of his taxi&#13;
was still open. I threw myself into the taxi, which he seemed to regard as a perfectly reasonable thing&#13;
to do. He sort of picked me up off the floor, and we just went on. He could be as friendly as one could&#13;
imagine if you were perhaps bold enough to settle down and talk to him. Now, I'm not talking at all&#13;
about face to face dealings on some topic that you were sent into the room to speak to him about. I&#13;
just mean talking to him informally on a plane or in the street or in the corridors. I found that you&#13;
could do it, and he was nice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you have occasion over the years to speak in their offices to the various Presidents on&#13;
the various memos or speeches that you were helping to write?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes. Not nearly as often as any of the operating people, of course, but sometimes in my&#13;
own capacity, and sometimes in an acting capacity. Once I became Department Director I then had a&#13;
kind of constitutional right to go and talk. And Mr. McNamara was very approachable on the phone.&#13;
If you were willing to come into the Bank at 8 o'clock in the morning, which was normal for me, you&#13;
could find him on the telephone directly at that hour. But then when I was Department Director I&#13;
would often be an acting Vice President, and then I would sit in what was then called the President's&#13;
Council. It wasn't the Managing Committee. So I did get to talk to him some .&#13;
&#13;
                                         .&#13;
OLIVER: Let's get for the record what department it is, and then we'll go back to the moment you&#13;
came into the Bank. And I'm sure your writing skills will be prominently discussed then since you've&#13;
done a fair amount of that for Presidents.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Oh, yes. I've done a lot of writing in the Bank. It's probably about the only thing I really&#13;
can do well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I came to the Bank as what they then called I think a staff assistant in what was then the Technical&#13;
Assistance and Liaison Department. I stayed in the same department until I left the Bank. That's 29&#13;
years, which may be a record, because in the Bank everybody moves around. Well, I didn't move, but&#13;
the name of the department changed. It had four different names. By the time I left, I was the&#13;
Director, and it was called then the International Relations Department. Before that it had been the&#13;
Development Services Department. And before that it had been Technical Assistance and Planning.&#13;
The frrst one, as I said, was Technical Assistance and Liaison. I became Director in 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I'll tell you another anecdote in a way about Mr. McNamara, which was that I was the frrst woman&#13;
Department Director. And for a year I was the only one. But I was the frrst. And the Bank's record&#13;
on promoting women at the level that is recognized, say, at the United Nations wasn't good. Just&#13;
witness the fact that it took until1975 to put a woman in a position that was listed in the front pages of&#13;
the Bank's telephone directory, for example. And so when the press release was prepared announcing&#13;
the appointment, it said that "Mrs. Boskey is the frrst woman Director." It was shown to me, and I&#13;
thought, well, that was legitimate. It was a fact, and if the Bank wanted to get some credit for it, why&#13;
not? Because it had finally gotten around to doing something. It went up to Mr. McNamara for&#13;
clearance, and he took out that phrase. I was told that he said, "Take the phrase out. That's not why&#13;
she's being appointed." Which I thought was a great compliment, and I was quite pleased. I hope the&#13;
story is true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm sure it's true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This was 1975?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: 1975. Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: By this time Richard Demuth had left the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Dick had left, and when he left, Mike [Michael L.J Hoffman, who was an Associate&#13;
Director under Dick, had taken over from Dick. He was Director for about three-and-a-half years.&#13;
Then he retired from the Bank, and I was made Director. And I was there until I retired three-and-a-&#13;
half years ago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Prior to Dick Demuth's leaving the Bank in I guess it must have been 1972--something like&#13;
that--you worked every closely with him in the various departments, whatever their title was then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Whatever the title was, yes. No, I was really his assistant. Dick was full of ideas. And the&#13;
Bank followed a lot of the initiatives. The new organizations that were created as Bank affiliates either&#13;
originated with Dick--really originated--or the germ of the idea was confided to Dick to work over.&#13;
And our working system essentially was that he would sit behind his desk and would talk a bit and I&#13;
would write down some illegible notes, and then I'd try to blow it up into a memorandum or whatever&#13;
it was we had decided on. And he would edit that, and I would edit his editing of my editing. and back&#13;
and forth. And fmally something would emerge. I don't want to downgrade myself to the extent of&#13;
saying that nothing that emerged was ever wholly my product. It was. But I'm just saying our&#13;
relationship was really a very good one, because neither of us had the nasty kind of pride of authorship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You were symbiotic writers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: I think that's fair. Dick is extremely articulate both in speaking and in writing. He did the&#13;
Annual Meeting speeches. There used not to be an official speech writer, if we go way back, and Dick&#13;
would do the drafts of that speech and the speeches made up at the UN. Probably the principal&#13;
responsibility of the department over the years was the Bank's relationship with the United Nations.&#13;
There was a great deal of writing associated with that.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: Well, maybe we could talk about some of the major initiatives that you and&#13;
Dick--particularly you as an individual--were associated with. Since you mentioned Mike Hoffman,&#13;
who spent a fair amount of time with EDI [Economic Development Institute], I'd like to ask for your&#13;
thoughts about the evolution of that enterprise. I think Dick had a heavy hand in that, did he not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: He did, and you know I think that may be one in which I had a very limited part, because I&#13;
can't visualize any writing that I did with EDI until much later. Have you heard about the McNamara&#13;
Fellowship Program?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: I've heard vaguely about it, but please tell me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, that was something that happened really just before I left the Bank. The Bank&#13;
wanted to do something that would perpetuate Mr. McNamara's name apart from all the things he did&#13;
to immortalize it himself. There's the Eugene R. Black Auditorium, so we thought there should be&#13;
something for Mr. McNamara. And the idea was to set up a fund to which governments would&#13;
contribute and out of which we could finance some kind of advanced study by individuals from&#13;
developing countries working in another developing country, or, in a developed one. But it was to be a&#13;
developing-country recipient. I think that program is perhaps three or four years old now. It is carried&#13;
out under the auspices of EDI. EDI sends out announcements about the programs, screens&#13;
applications, and there is an international board. I don't know who's now on it. I remember the first&#13;
board, but nothing since. And they review the applications and decide who will receive what is effect a&#13;
kind of scholarship. They pay a stipend to cover expenses. And it's not for getting an advanced degree.&#13;
It's not because you want to earn a Ph.D. degree, but if you're carrying out research that will be of&#13;
interest or contribute to the development of the developing countries, your project is eligible for&#13;
consideration. There's not a lot of money in the fund, and they're just using the interest from it. But&#13;
it's something which, if you're going to talk to EDI people, you might want to pursue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I infer that you had a hand in choosing this?&#13;
&amp;#12;..   BOSKEY                                            -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Oh, yes. I had a hand in drafting the proposal. This was something which the Board had to&#13;
     approve. I did draft the proposal which went to the Board, and helped to set up the first arrangements&#13;
     for determining how the individuals were to be picked and getting the announcements and so forth. It&#13;
     was sort the beginning of EDI itself that I didn't have much to do with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Without my suggesting specific projects that you might have been involved in, maybe you&#13;
     would just tell what major projects you think of as those that you've worked on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Well, the origins of IDA [International Development Association]. Dick picked that up, or&#13;
     it was given to Dick to pick up from Senator [A. S. Mike] Monroney's original idea, which was to fmd a&#13;
     way of putting into productive use the PL480 funds which were accruing in developing countries. And&#13;
     it grew to something considerably more than that, as you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: But I said before that Dick had been a lawyer and I was and there was another man in the&#13;
     department who had been a lawyer. We worked very closely with the Legal Department. We were&#13;
     rather honorary members of the Legal Department. And there was a committee set up predominantly&#13;
     with Legal Department people, and Dick and me, to consider what issues should be dealt with in&#13;
     designing the IDA Articles of Agreement. We did what we called a "Principal Points" paper in which&#13;
     we asked the Bank's Executive Directors, who were commissioned to design IDA, for example, what&#13;
     should be the qualifications for membership, what kinds of projects IDA should fmance, what should&#13;
     be the terms of IDA lending. You can invent all sorts of questions on which we needed guidance. And&#13;
     we put the question, the pros and cons, of going one way or another before the Board, had a discussion&#13;
     in the Board--an informal discussion--and with the results of that discussion in hand we then would&#13;
     translate them into the language of the Articles of Agreement. And subsequently both Dick and I had&#13;
     a hand in raising the issues about any possible changes in IDA terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The same thing for Bank policy. We would write the memos which would form the basis for&#13;
     discussions by a larger group. We did the same thing for IFC.&#13;
&amp;#12;     BOSKEY                                            -10-&#13;
'&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Before you talk about IFC, could I ask a couple of just technical questions about how things&#13;
     happen in the Bank. In the case of Monroney's suggestion that later resulted in IDA, what would be&#13;
     the process by which it would get to staff? Would some Executive Director bring it up at a Board&#13;
     meeting? Or, would the President likely think it's a good idea and assign it to staff? Or is it something&#13;
     that Dick Demuth himself might initiate? I'm concerned about the process by which ideas get started&#13;
     in the Bank and go round and round until something comes out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Well, I'm not sure I remember specifically how the Monroney idea came into our bands. I&#13;
     think what happened was that the U.S. Governor picked up the proposal and referred to it in an&#13;
     Annual Meeting speech, saying, in effect, that the Bank ought to look into this. And within the Bank&#13;
     then it probably was assigned by the President to Dick. Usually there would be a memorandum.&#13;
     Sometimes there wouldn't be anything in writing. Dick would just come down and say, "Mr. Black,&#13;
     Mr. Woods, Mr. McNamara wants us, wants me, to look into this." And then we would begin our&#13;
     talking. It might be something which could be handled just between Dick and me. That is, the&#13;
     proposal could be reduced to writing and the thoughts that we had, and it could go straight back up.&#13;
     More often it would be a proposal, or the germ of a proposal which had much wider ramifications, and&#13;
     what he did then would be what was done very often in the Bank in those days, convene a committee&#13;
     which would include the Legal Department representatives and then some of the Bank's well-known&#13;
     thinkers just to have an open discussion, which would then get reduced to writing and we'd decide how&#13;
     to proceed. And ultimately it would go back to the President. I would ususally be the Secretary of the&#13;
     group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         I don't remember ever--I shouldn't say ever. But I really don't remember anything coming to us&#13;
     directly from the Board. But, of course, I don't know what ideas an Executive Director might have&#13;
    . raised with the President of the Bank before it came down.&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
,Â·   BOSKEY                                             -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: I also infer from your comment that, at least through the presidency of Gene Black, if an&#13;
     idea were to be discussed by staff and it didn't fit neatly into an existing project or area department that&#13;
     Dick Demuth and you would likely be assigned to it because you were the think tank, so to speak, for&#13;
     new ideas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: I think that's fair. That's certainly my impression. You may very well fmd people&#13;
     contemporaneous with us who would rise up in horror at that characterization, but that's really what I&#13;
     think. And that's what you're asking me now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: I think that really is true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: You also referred to the Board meeting as an informal Board. Can you say just a little bit&#13;
     about that procedure?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Yes. Again, I don't know whether it exists still. I suspect it does. But in those days--I do&#13;
     sound ancient when I say "in those days." I can feel myself aging by the moment, getting greyer and&#13;
     greyer and greyer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: You've just had a great deal of exciting experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: There was a procedure called the Committee of the Whole. That simply meant that the&#13;
     Directors were sitting as individuals, and they were speaking for themselves. If they happened to have&#13;
     an instruction from their government at that point, they could voice it. But they could also simply&#13;
     express an opinion which would not be held to bind their governments at later stage. It was a very&#13;
     useful technique because it meant that you didn't have to wait for your discussion until everybody had&#13;
     been instructed, because some governments just were so slow in instructing their Directors that you'd&#13;
     never come to a conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: I take it no vote would be taken.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: That's another thing. No vote. But the odd thing, a slight paradox, was that when the&#13;
Executive Directors sit as the Board of the Bank, the record of their discussions--a verbatim--is not&#13;
&#13;
circulated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Is it a tape?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: A stenotypist takes it all down, but the only thing that's recorded as minutes and circulated&#13;
is the simple statement that the Board approved the loan to so and so, or the Board approved the&#13;
President's memorandum on such and such a policy. And that's all that turns up in the formal minutes.&#13;
When the Directors sat as a Committee of the Whole, we actually did a precis of the Board discussions&#13;
which was circulated. So that we have more of a record for the informal discussions than we do of the&#13;
formal Board. And I used to work on those precis too. We would take the transcript of the meeting&#13;
and then turn it into a text, with attributions usually, which we could then use as a basis for moving&#13;
ahead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Might these be circulated as senior staff or ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: They certainly would go to senior staff. I have books and books of the IDA discussions.&#13;
They were never indexed. Did you ever interview Lester Nurick?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Not yet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: No. But you may? Well, it doesn't matter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I did interview him back in 1961, but I have not interviewed him this time around.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, I was thinking. It doesn't matter for this point. But I never could convince him that I&#13;
didn't have an indexed text of the IDA discussions, because he would call and say, "Can you tell me&#13;
whether and where they discussed the question, whether you can have thus and so or not thus and so?"&#13;
I did keep an informal index that I wrote myself on the margins of the precis. But we never did a true&#13;
legislative analysis.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I assume these are all in the archives of the Bank now?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Oh, yes, I'm sure they are, because the precis were dated and numbered as Secretary's&#13;
memoranda. And the IDA discussions went very quickly. You know, that was really remarkable.&#13;
From day one when we began to consider IDA to the last day when the Articles of Agreement were&#13;
approved was just a matter of a few months. And this was an international agreement. Think of the&#13;
time that it takes to get other kinds of international agreements. Of course, it went that fast because&#13;
there was a genuine commitment to get IDA going before it ever began, and then it went very fast. It's&#13;
when governments are not so enthusiastic that they drag their feet or lose interest, which is what&#13;
happened to the original proposal, which Dick and I also worked on, for investment insurance, on&#13;
which we spent--not just we, the Legal Department too--a great deal of time. The Legal Department&#13;
spent about ten years on and off. And the proposal apparently died.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, but I think what you did is well worth describing, if you will.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: You mean the way we went about it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And the content. What the proposal was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Oh, well, it's a version of the proposal. This is really a phoenix proposal, because it has just&#13;
come to life again, and this time it really looks as though it will stay alive. It has a new name. It's now&#13;
called the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency--MIGA. And it used to be called the&#13;
International Investment Insurance Agency--called IliA. It had the same objective, which was to&#13;
provide an international or multilateral system of insurance for private investors making investments, in&#13;
loan or equity or indeed in some other form, in the private sector in developing countries. The purpose&#13;
of the scheme was to remove what was believed to be a very serious barrier to private investment&#13;
moving into developing countries, namely the political risk, concern that investments would&#13;
expropriated or that you wouldn't be able to take your earnings out of the country in convertible form,&#13;
and finally that there would be a risk of loss through war or insurrection. And the rationale was that if&#13;
you insured an investor against loss by reason of these risks, even though, of course, he would much&#13;
prefer to have his investment whole, he still would at least be compensated for any loss which might&#13;
result and would therefore be induced to make the investment despite the risks.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: These would be investments by private investors in private concerns in other countries.&#13;
They were not guarantees of loans to governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Exactly. Exactly. Because what they were interested in was encouraging the businessman&#13;
to go and build something new. It had to be new investment. That is the point. It was not just going&#13;
inlo a country and putting more money in something which was there. The idea was to encourage&#13;
additional flows. So you would have demonstrate to begin with, before you could get your insurance,&#13;
that you were about to make a brand new investment in the developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: What the economists called direct investment rather than portfolio investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Very likely, but this was one of the issues, of course. What kind of investment would be&#13;
covered? Because there were in existence three national schemes at the time. And when I say&#13;
'national' I mean three countries which were prepared to insure their own investors, but nobody else's,&#13;
going into a developing country. The three were the United States, Germany and Japan; and I believe&#13;
that the Japanese scheme covered only loans. Now, I may be wrong, but the point is it was not&#13;
inevitable that a scheme would cover every form of investment. And that was a question which would&#13;
have to be decided in this case if you set up a scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The reason for having an international scheme was that some countries were too small to support&#13;
schemes of their own or that their investors were investing very heavily in one or two countries but&#13;
were not spreading out and the home country couldn't afford to have the risk concentrated in that&#13;
fashion. Under a multilateral scheme, the risk of loss would be spread among all the countries&#13;
participating in the scheme. And then thirdly, or whatever number I'm up to, there was also the&#13;
possibility of reinsurance by the multilateral scheme of guarantees and insurance issued by the national&#13;
schemes. That was the role that was seen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It took so long to discuss this program in the Board--particularly since it ended with nothing at the&#13;
time--that by the time we suspended discussion for lack of evidence of interest on governments' part,&#13;
the number of national schemes had grown to something like 14 or 15--in that area--which&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
probably demonstrated that there was indeed an interest in the insurance--mm insurance--even though&#13;
you couldn't get governments to do this multilaterally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The 14 and 15 would all have been developed country governments, would they not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes, and they varied. I think they all probably covered all three of the types of risks that I&#13;
mentioned, but they were not all global. My recollection is--and I haven't looked at this in years--that&#13;
the Nordic countries insured their investors ouly in countries in which there was a national--Nordic-&#13;
-interest. That is, I think their schemes were heavily oriented toward Africa, and the German scheme&#13;
was confined to countries which had entered into an agreement with Germany respecting what you&#13;
might call a code of conduct--that isn't the right term, but that's the idea--toward foreign investment.&#13;
Under the international scheme there would be no such restrictions. It would apply to any developing&#13;
country that chose to join the scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was there ever a suggestion that lower income or developing countries should participate in&#13;
some sort of a multilateral guaranteeing organization?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes, the idea was that this would be a multinational scheme exactly like the Bank. The&#13;
developing countries would be members and so would developed countries. The variations came in the&#13;
obligations that the developing country members might bear. The scheme that the Bank considered&#13;
initially came to us in an outline form from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and&#13;
Development], and in that scheme the developing countries would be members, but they would not&#13;
have to assume any fmancial obligation. They would have to approve an investment for guarantee. In&#13;
other words, nothing would be guaranteed if the host country was not prepared to accept it. But that&#13;
would essentially be the end of their obligation, and they would not have to say that they would refrain&#13;
from expropriating an investment or that they would never impose a limit on the convertibility of&#13;
earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So we started with the premise that the developing countries would have no obligation. But in the&#13;
course of the discussion in the Bank, the idea came in--and my recollection is that it was proposed&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
by the United States--that the developing countries should assume some fmancial obligation in the&#13;
event of a loss, partly as evidence of their being full partners even though the obligation wouldn't be as&#13;
heavy an obligation as the developed countries carried, and also partly possibly to have some deterrent&#13;
effect on their performance--on their actions. Of course, it's difficult to see how a loss sharing&#13;
obligation would have any deterrent effect at all on anything except the expropriation risk. If the&#13;
International Monetary Fund teUs a country to devalue or to restrict currency convertibility, it's going&#13;
to do that without regard to the consequences under under the international insurance scheme, and it&#13;
certainly isn't going to refrain from war because it's a participant in an insurance scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: At any rate, that was one of the considerations over which the scheme stumbled and&#13;
eventually died. And another serious problem was the notion of subrogation, and international&#13;
arbitration, which was not palatable to the Latin American countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I infer from the fact that you and Dick worked on this that there was some implication that&#13;
the Bank itself would have been the organization to have adminstered ....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, as I recall, when we first did a study in 1962--which I wrote--of the idea of&#13;
multilateral investment insurance we explicity excluded the issue of administration by any organization.&#13;
Mr. Black's foreword says that. There were certainly some proponents of a scheme who wanted the&#13;
Bank to run it for precisely the reason that the Bank might have been reluctant to do it, that it would&#13;
get mixed in with the Bank's ability to lend or to withhold lending. Some people said, "Let the Bank&#13;
administer it, and it can nse its lending as a kind of stick." But as the scheme developed, obviously you&#13;
had to think of administration. And while this organization would be a new and independent&#13;
international institution with its own Articles of Agreement, one of the issues was whether there should&#13;
be a link with the Bank and to what extent. For instance, should it have a Board of Directors--a&#13;
common Board of Directors as IFC and IDA do with the Bank, or should they be completely different?&#13;
And, should the President be the President of the institution? Should you use the same staff?&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
     Now, this question still had to be faced in 1985 and 1986 when the scheme was revived by Mr.&#13;
Clausen, who proposed it in his first Annual Meeting speech. Whether he was aware of the long&#13;
history that the concept had in the Bank, I don't know. I think probably not. But there were--there are&#13;
individuals in the U.S. business community who think that it would be a good idea to have such a&#13;
scheme and he therefore proposed it, and Mr. [Ibrahim F. 1.) Shihata--the Bank's Vice President and&#13;
General Counsel--has picked it up and has made it into a reality. There is a new Convention which has&#13;
been signed by a sufficient number of governments on the developed and on the developing countries'&#13;
side to meet the test set out in the Convention for setting up a meeting to consider rules and&#13;
regulations and, in effect, the operating provisions of a multilateral investment guarantee agency. As&#13;
yet, no government has committed itself. Governments have signed the agreement, but that is not the&#13;
same as saying they have committed themselves to join the organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And if there is such an organization, while many of the members would be Bank members,&#13;
and it's possible that some Bank staff might be involved in administering it, it would be separate from&#13;
the Bank in the same way that IFC is separate from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It would be separate from the Bank. There would be a link through the President I think.&#13;
I haven't looked at the draft lately. But certainly at one stage the governments were given the option to&#13;
name their Executive Director to be a Director or to name someone other than their Director. You&#13;
see, this organization would call for a completely different kind of expertise. You can see that for IDA,&#13;
IFC and the Bank, the fmance ministeries are the appropriate sources of ....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Contact with the government.Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Right. But for an investment guarantee agency, the Ministry of Finance might not be&#13;
appropriate. And certainly the governments that already have investment guarantee programs of their&#13;
own might choose to name for this purpose an agency with investment guarantee experience. I think&#13;
it's open to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But before we talk about some of the other major projects that you have worked on, maybe&#13;
I might just ask about procedures again. You would get an assignment like this, and then you'd be&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(OLIVER)&#13;
pretty much on your own, so you decided whether to spend two years on it or ten years on it unless you&#13;
had to have a report back to the President by such-and-such a date. And you would write and you&#13;
would contact governments as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, to some extent, yes. But it was a bit more circumscribed than that. Dick and I might&#13;
walk around to E.D.s' offices and talk to them about particular proposals, but we really didn't decide&#13;
how long we would spend on it. When I said that the scheme dropped for lack of interest, that was&#13;
because a great deal of staff time was spent working out proposals. The discussions in the Committee&#13;
of the Whole pointed to something more than we could do. When we ended with what we thought&#13;
might be a semi-fmal Convention, we gave it to the Directors to send out to governments for comment,&#13;
and then we put it to one side completely. And months and months and months went by, and we did&#13;
not have enough expressions of opinion to warrant reconvening to make changes. And fmally Mr.&#13;
McNamara sent a memorandum to the Board saying that we had not had the expression of interest that&#13;
we would require or expect and unless by such-and-such a date we did have it, no more staff time&#13;
would be spent on it. In other words, we were simply being agents for the governments. If they had&#13;
expressed an interest, we could have gone on forever. Well, I hope not forever, but anyway longer. But&#13;
if they didn't, there was certainly no point making that investment at the time. So that one was dictated&#13;
really by reactions from governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Sometimes work was dictated by the United Nations where we had to have-the Board might not be&#13;
involved at all--but where we had to have a report in by the next General Assembly or by some fixed&#13;
time. Other times it might be the sort of thing where the President said, "I want a report in two weeks."&#13;
More likely than not, within the Bank, a time limit was not put on it, and that might simply hiiVe been a&#13;
reflection of the fact that Dick was not disposed to procrastinate if he was asked to do something.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I want to ask a question that relates to the issue of how Bank staff works with or addresses&#13;
itself to governments. In this case, it sounds to me as though you were really working through the&#13;
President or the Executive Directors, so it was up to the Executive Directors on behalf of their&#13;
governments to express interest or lack of interest. I have been told that in the case of the IDA&#13;
negotiations, which strung out through the greater part of the 1960's, Mr. (Irving S.] Friedman&#13;
&amp;#12;     BOSKEY                                             -19Â·&#13;
.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     [OLIVER]&#13;
     and Mr.(J. Burke] Knapp, in particular, but also other senior people in the Bank, were requested by the&#13;
     United States Government through the President again to deal directly with governments. They would&#13;
     go and talk to Finance Ministers and Presidents of countries, in many instances going round the&#13;
     Executive Directors or just leaving them out of the circle, so to speak. Which of these two ways of&#13;
     staffs working with governments was the more normal would you say?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Well, I think when you referred to going to directly to governments you're talking about&#13;
     negotiations for IDA Replenishment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: And if you contrast that with the negotiations, if you could call them that, for the IDA&#13;
     Articles of Agreement itself, you fmd both types. The IDA Articles of Agreement itself were&#13;
     considered in the Board, and we were working with the Directors. They had been asked by the&#13;
     Governors to work out the arrangements for Articles of Agreement for IDA, and our contacts were&#13;
     exclusively I think--certainly mine were--with the Board. It involved a commitment of money&#13;
     ultimately. That wasn't the immediate issue. The IDA negotiations as far as I know were carried out&#13;
     directly with governments or through the IDA Deputies; they are meeting fairly soon, I think, on the&#13;
     current Replenishment, or may just have met. The Deputies are representatives of the Part I countries&#13;
     which will contribute to the Replenishment. And whoever is taking the lead in the Bank--at the&#13;
     moment, the Vice President for F'mance, I assume--meets with the IDA Deputies. There also were&#13;
     visits to capitals in which these issues were talked about. So they're not mutually exclusive. We used&#13;
     one approach sometimes and one another time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Sure. I didn't mean to imply they are mutually exclusive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Just by the nature of the thing I was never involved in approaches directly to capitals. And&#13;
     as far as I know, for negotiation purposes--well, loan negotiations are certainly carried out with&#13;
     representatives of governments here or there. The Board is not involved in those until the stage of&#13;
     lending. So they are two really different techniques depending on what the aim is at the end.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, now going way back in our conversation, maybe 20 minutes ago, you were starting to&#13;
tell me about some of the major ideas that developed in Dick Demuth's shop, and I think you were&#13;
about to say something about the IFC when I interrupted you. At any rate, shall we get back on that&#13;
track?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It's the same. It was exactly the same idea. The notion for the IFC emerged in a report&#13;
prepared outside the Bank, but the Bank was already aware of the fact that it wasn't doing very much in&#13;
the way of financing industrial development in the developing countries. And what it was doing, it was&#13;
doing through national development banks or development fmance companies, which is something else&#13;
that I was involved in. At the end--I'm cutting across my own lines now, but I'll remember to come&#13;
back to IFC, or you'll remind me if I don't remember.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   There was a period when setting up a national industrial development bank was a very popular thing&#13;
to do. I think you told me you were going to be talking to Bill Diamond.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Tomorrow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, Bill wrote a book on that. I think it was the first one that was ever written on&#13;
industrial development banks. He took two or three and analyzed them in depth. And as more of&#13;
those banks were created, this Bank began to be involved in helping to set them up and helping to&#13;
fmance them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     And Dick and I organized a conference of development bank managers, because we thought that&#13;
experience of one might very well be helpful to another, especially the experience of one that had been&#13;
.going for a few years. We brought U, 15, something like that, development bank managers into&#13;
Washington and sat them down for about a week with an agenda of topics which appeared to us to be&#13;
of general interest, assuming you were a development bank manager at all, on how do you arrive at&#13;
interest rates, what do you do about forgiving debt, what are your terms, all sorts of questions. And we&#13;
kept a record of the discussions. We did a precis without particular attributions. And out of that I&#13;
produced a book on development banks, which was the second book ever written on development&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -21-&#13;

&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
banks. There was a brief period when I really was an expert on development banks. Unfortunately&#13;
that then became so much a part of the Bank's activity--the fmancing of development banks--that they&#13;
set up a department in the Bank and then later on it went over to IFC on development banks&#13;
specifically, and I no longer bad anything to do with it. But you certainly want to ask Dick about it. I&#13;
think one of the chapters of the book was done by Mervyn Weiner, whom you said you were also going&#13;
to see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: That was just a little by-product of his. He may even have forgotten.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'll remind him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Remind him. I think he might remember.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Well, at any rate, the point was that the Bank's lending for industry was done largely through&#13;
development banks. And IFC was set up to do that kind of investment without requiring a government&#13;
guarantee. You see, that was the stumbling block for some of the Bank fmancing, because in order to&#13;
borrow, you'd have to have a government guarantee. And a lot of private business didn't want to get a&#13;
government guarantee because they felt that the government would then be sticking its nose in their&#13;
business. And go~rnments were sometimes reluctant to give a guarantee, because that might appear&#13;
to be favoring one businessman over another. That was really why the development bank was set up.&#13;
It was an intermediary between the private business and the Bank. It was the development bank that&#13;
got a guarantee, not the individual businessman.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    IFC was in effect an extension of that concept, because it was working with the private sector. And&#13;
we proceeded in exactly the same way as we had done with the other ideas, with a "Principal Points"&#13;
paper outlining issues and saying to governments, "This is what you have to consider." For instance,&#13;
should IFC operate in the less developed areas of developing countries, or should they only deal with&#13;
developing countries themselves? What should IFC's terms be? All sorts of issues of that kind.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                              -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
And those points were discussed in the Board, which then gave us a guide, and we translated the guide&#13;
into the Articles of Agreement which they then looked at and commented on and sent back to&#13;
governments for final review, and ultimately for signature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I know that Dick Demuth personally was sort of the Bank's liaison in the early Black years,&#13;
and perhaps later, with various outside organizations like the UN, WHO, and so on. Did you yourself&#13;
become involved in these also? And could you say a word about the evolution of the Bank's relations?&#13;
It is my impression that in the early Woods years there was a good deal more of what you might call a&#13;
friendly attitude toward liaison with UN-type organizations. I've asked two questions at once.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: That's all right. My answers are not models of clarity, so I wouldn't worry about that.&#13;
Well, one of the principal responsibilities of the department was precisely the UN; the department was&#13;
the Bank's liaison with the United Nations. And Dick, in fact--oh, I'm sure he's spoken for himself. I&#13;
keep saying Dick did this, and you probably know all this already. But what I did was so much related&#13;
to what he did that I can't avoid it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Before I came to the Bank, Dick had been the principal actor in the negotiation of what is called&#13;
technically the Bank's relationship agreement with the United Nations. The UN Charter provides that&#13;
organizations in the economic, social, cultural--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 LIVER: Scientific?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: --educational, health and related--fields are to enter into a relationship with the UN. And&#13;
they thereby become what is known as a specialized agency of the United Nations. And the Bank&#13;
entered into such an agreement as did FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization], and WHO (World&#13;
Health Organization], and ILO (International Labour Organization], and UNESCO [United Nations&#13;
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization], and others. But the Bank is the only one of those&#13;
organizations--apart from the Fund--which is a fmancial organization, and it doesn't depend for its&#13;
budget on contributions from UN members. And so the Bank and the Fund are in a very special&#13;
relationship with the UN. The Bank's agreement with the UN has been described as a&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                              -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
declaration of independence rather than a binding together. And the UN recognized that we were&#13;
different from the other organizations and that it could not dictate the terms of our loans. It could&#13;
make recommendations and that's all. So we're in a special position because we don't have to abide by&#13;
UN resolutions whereas the other organizations really do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  But though the relationship is a little bit different on paper, the fact is that we had a very close daily&#13;
relationship with the UN in New York and Geneva and with the other international organizations that&#13;
are specialized agencies. We've got a man up in New York and one in Geneva whose job is just to be a&#13;
liaison, to find out what the UN is saying about the Bank and to explain the Bank to the UN&#13;
delegations and correct misunderstandings. He also provides information and sees to it that peculiar&#13;
things don't get into resolutions which would be awkward for us, even though we are not bound by&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think there's a Bank person in Paris who is liaison to OECD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well. we have a Paris office and they do that very much. But OECD is in a slightly&#13;
different relationship. In the first place, it isn't part of the UN and, secondly, it doesn't adopt&#13;
resolutions saying the Bank ought to be doing this and ought to be doing that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  In addition, during the Woods era the Bank began to fmance projects in the education sector. And it&#13;
sounds a bit laughable now, but at the time we thought that we would not build up a technical staff in&#13;
the education field. There was already UNESCO in existence, and we thought UNESCO would be the&#13;
Bank's technical arm and we'd rely on them for analysis of projects and we would do the fmancing.&#13;
And we entered into what we called a cooperative program with UNESCO under which UNESCO&#13;
would throw up projects for consideration by the Bank. It wouldn't do the fmal analysis. We felt we&#13;
had to do the appraisal work ourselves. But it would do a lot of the preliminary work for us. And we&#13;
did exactly the same thing with FAO. We had a cooperative program with FAO. Later on we entered&#13;
into an agreement with WHO, in water supply, so we had three. Later there was an agreement with&#13;
UNIDO [United Nations Industrial Development Organization]. It was the smallest of the four and&#13;
was never really successful. ILO has tried for years to get us to enter into a program with them, but we&#13;
never felt that we had enough volume of activity in ILO's field of competence to justify it. And when&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                            -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
I say to justify it, the programs called for the Bank to meet 75 percent of the cost of the programs, the&#13;
teams that would do the analytical work, who sat in the partner agency. Not here. The partner agency&#13;
would meet only 25 percent of the costs. And these costs began to mount up very substantially over&#13;
the years. But by now these programs have gone downhill. They are now being phased out. We've&#13;
already phased out the WHO one. We've run into difficulties with UNESCO. The one that will&#13;
survive probably is the one with FAO. The agriculture program is still very active.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How about UNDP [United Nations Development Program]?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, UNDP is different. That is an organ of the United Nations, but it's not a separate&#13;
specialized agency. We went on for years without a formal agreement with UNDP, but some years ago&#13;
we did enter into an agreement which really simply embodied what we were doing all along. That&#13;
program is expanding as I understand it. Under the arrangements with UNDP, the Bank, like a&#13;
number of other UN organizations, is the executing agency for projects fmanced by UNDP. We don't&#13;
fmance the project, but we help carry it out. And my understanding is that we are very much increasing&#13;
the number of projects under which the Bank is executing agency for UNDP. But more than that there&#13;
are projects where UNDP, which has a small unit that can itself act as executing agency, is being the&#13;
agency for Bank-fmanced projects. It's working both ways. That's on the technical assistance side, and&#13;
that's been growing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Well, what can you say about your own personal involvement in the evolution of these programs?&#13;
Was this a major part of your activity?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes. I had something to do on the negotiation of those cooperative programs-- though not&#13;
anything like as much as Dick did. I came into it at a later stage when we were reporting to the Board&#13;
on them or dealing with some aspects of the day-to-day problems. We negotiated the agreement in&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[BOSKEY]&#13;
our department because that was a relationship aspect. As soon as it became operational, it went off to&#13;
the technical departments. I mean we didn't really deal with the daily progress in agriculture. We&#13;
didn't deal with health, and we didn't deal with education--or whatever one I left out. Whenever there&#13;
were problems, troubles or renegotiation involved, then we got back into that. This continued to be&#13;
true after Dick retired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I daresay your training as an attorney must have been very valuable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It probably helped, because it meant that I could put things down on paper with some&#13;
degree of clarity and with some degree of speed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: And we tended to, I think, get to the point rather quickly--or so we thought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: We've talked a little bit about these expanding relationships in the Woods era, and you&#13;
mentioned in passing that lending for education began essentially in the Woods time and expanded a&#13;
great deal later. What other sort of initiatives might you identify off the top of your head that you&#13;
associate with the years 1963 to 1968?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, I think that the br.ginnings of the Young Professional Program came then. As I&#13;
remenber, it began the same way, with someone saying where we really ought to be thinking about how&#13;
we can build the Bank's staff up from the bottom when those who were here at the beginning, will have&#13;
retired. And that thought then was confided to a committee of thinkers in the Bank that Dick&#13;
organized, and they considered what you would do, who would you get, how many would you get, how&#13;
would you finance it, how would you recruit them, what would you do with whoever they were once&#13;
they got here, what kind of training might ~ou give them, would you keep them in a separate unit for X&#13;
number of years, or would you try to send them off into various parts of the Bank very quickly. All the&#13;
issues which a bright group of minds would think of. And when that had been talked through, then a&#13;
report up to the President and saying, "This is what the committee recommends." And then it might go&#13;
somewhere or it might not.&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY                                            -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     [BOSKEY]&#13;
          We also considered the role of resident missions. I think I said to you at lunch that my time sense&#13;
     is poor in the extreme, and I don't remember whether we had resident missions already. We must have&#13;
     had some, but we certainly didn't have very many. One of those committees considered whether the&#13;
     resident missions were doing a good job, what role they were performing, and whether this was the&#13;
     kind of thing whieh should be expanded or we should retreat on. We never sent a resident mission out&#13;
     unless the government was prepared to accept it. I don't know to what degree the government's arm&#13;
     was twisted, but they did vary. Sometimes it was a one-man mission. It still is. The role of a one-man&#13;
     mission was essentially to get the government to answers letters or requests or cables or telephone calls&#13;
     sooner. If we had a big program in the country, it might be to expedite it and to keep tabs on it. In&#13;
     India they write the economic report there. So they vary in their purpose. My recollection is that that&#13;
     committee canvassed the role of resident missions and then made a recommendation on whether the&#13;
     resident mission program should or should not be expanded or varied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: You used in passing the marvelous phrase "Dick got together the thinkers in the Bank." I&#13;
     take it the thinkers in the Bank were not altogether synonymous with the senior staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: How did Dick decide who were the thinkers in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Well, they probably did consist largely of senior staff--self-annointed or not--but he&#13;
     certainly didn't feel confmed to senior staff. Remember, we're talking about a much smaller Bank than&#13;
     today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Much of what we've talked about bas been in the Black years, has it not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Well, Black and Woods. Not so much on the McNamara side, though. The think tank&#13;
     concept bad shifted somewhat to the economic policy side, and the Department was getting far fewer&#13;
     concepts to work out. So probably I was talking mueh more about Black and Woods than I was about&#13;
     McNamara. But even then the Bank was small relative to today. Nothing like as small as when I&#13;
&amp;#12;-Â·&#13;
     BOSKEY                                              -27-&#13;
-Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     (BOSKEY]&#13;
     first came, but you knew pretty much who the bright young men were--and I do say bright young men,&#13;
     because there just weren't very many women in the Bank. Maybe I should say bright young persons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Without trying to be inclusive, would you just name some? Who would you expect to see?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: WeU, let me think. You would have seen [Aron] Broches and [Lester] Nurick and [Sydney&#13;
     Raymond] Cope and [Andrew L.] Kamarck. There were certain common denominators, and then&#13;
     there would always have been someone who might be associated with a particular field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       For instance, when we were working on the investment insurance, we'd have somebody like Ben&#13;
     [Benjamin B.] King in it, because Ben could fiddle with figures. We were working with a very&#13;
     complicated formula for loss sharing, and Ben was probably the only person in the Bank who&#13;
     understood it because he had designed it. I don't think he could reconstruct it anymore today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: Okay. WeU, you were starting to say as far as your own personal involvement. Maybe you&#13;
     would talk abaut it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: Yes, I wiD. I was thinking about something which started in the department caUed the&#13;
     "Development Services Department Newsletter", which I inherited and worked on for several years. It&#13;
     wasn't started by me. It was a periodic report which was sent to staff overseas as a means of keeping&#13;
     them informed on what was going on in the Bank. I've forgotten the year I inherited it, but I think it&#13;
     was in the 1960s and it went on until about 1973. And somehow, some persons in the Bank saw the&#13;
     "Newsletter" and found in it information which was completely new to them, even though they were in&#13;
     Headquarters. And that astounded me, because I always thought that while the Department was a very&#13;
     important part of the Bank, it was a little off to one side--not the center of the action.&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
..   BOSKEY                                            -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: You went to the Loan Committee?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOSKEY: No, I didn't. I wrote the "Newsletter" or gathered the material by picking up things that&#13;
     went across my desk and throwing them into my drawer and then once a month or so, every few weeks,&#13;
     I would take it all out and try to make a "Newsletter" design out of it. You know, seeing what loans we&#13;
     had made and Â·seeing whether there was anything in them that was unusual or some common pattern,&#13;
     or an expansion of something, or the announcement of who had been named to what. I mean almost&#13;
     anything that occurred to me. And I was startled, as I said, to find that this was regarded as a source of&#13;
     information for people at Headquarters. The result was that we began to distribute it to all staff, not&#13;
     desk to desk, but to all of the departments and the divisions, and then the copies would circulate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         We did that for several years until one day, unfortunately, it was given by mistake to a technical&#13;
     assistant to an Executive Director. Now, this piece of paper was designed for internal consumption to&#13;
     keep staff informed on what was happening in the Bank, what was under consideration, and what was&#13;
     particularly interesting in Board discussions, indicating what the management position on a point was.&#13;
     It went to an technical assistant to a Director, and it got into the hands of some Directors who&#13;
     perceived it as being slanted or biased, because when it gave the management position on a point, it did&#13;
     not necessarily show the Executive Director's rebuttal or reply. Well, it wasn't intended to. It was&#13;
     designed for a different purpose, and the Directors weren't supposed to be sending them home. These&#13;
     things were written for people who knew Bank procedures, knew what was going on on the Board and&#13;
     who would have some interest in knowing what the party line was. But the Directors objected to this.&#13;
     And my recollection was that we found that out in a curious way. You know there's a table in the&#13;
     dining room--! suppose it's still there--like a commons table. You didn't have a reservation, you just&#13;
     went and sat. And two Directors at that table were overheard by a staff member also at the table--not&#13;
     me--to make this comment about the "Newsletter," and this person told me. I don't remember who it&#13;
     was. And I told Dick, and Dick said "You'd better go talk to those two Directors and explain this to&#13;
     them." And so I did. They were astounded to fmd that what they called the intramural&#13;
     communications system was so good that practically the same day that they'd made the comment there&#13;
     was a reaction to it.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(BOSKEY]&#13;
    But at any rate, I did try to explain the purpose of this, and they understood but they were not&#13;
convinced. They just said it was naive to think that these papers would not get back to governments,&#13;
and what they were really concerned about was that their governments might think, because it didn't&#13;
report what they had said on a point of interest to their governments, that they weren't doing their job&#13;
properly. And so all the Board discussion aspects of this were taken out, and little by little the&#13;
"Newsletter" got so emasculated that it didn't really serve a purpose any more and it just stopped.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: About what year was this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It stopped about 1973 I think. Something like that. But it went on for a long time, and I&#13;
think probably they've got copies of them in archives. I think they really made rather interesting&#13;
reading. You did get a picture of the Bank. But this problem of intrabank communication has always&#13;
been a serious one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: And it's gotten worse or let's say it's gotten more attention&#13;
as the Bank has gotten bigger. There are all sorts of devices. Every Director of Information has&#13;
thought of a different way to approach this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm sure that these general tables still exist in the dining room, because that's where Mr.&#13;
(Barber) Conable sat today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Was he there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, I thought that was very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes, I had my back to that table so I didn't see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, one of the issues that came up during the relatively early years of the Woods&#13;
administration was given to the Bank by UNCfAD, which is not directly a UN agency either.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             .3().&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: It's just an organ. It's a branch, it's an aspect of the UN. An organization set up by the UN&#13;
itself, like UNDP, which is the difference. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Okay. At that time there was a great deal of optimism in the world about the process of&#13;
development. There was the UN Development Decade and then, of course, there was the Second&#13;
Development Decade. Now, looking back on all this period of time, some of us feel that it was a bit&#13;
naive to suppose that the development process could occur as rapidly as some then thought, or that the&#13;
governments of developed countries could he induced to give one percent or more of their gross&#13;
national product to fmance development. But in those years--1962, 1963, 1964 and so on--there was a&#13;
great deal of optimism in this regard. Of course, one proposal that came to the Bank from UNCfAD&#13;
was the so-called Horowitz proposal on which you did a fair amount of work together with both Dick&#13;
Demuth and to some extent Irving Friedman. We have the written documents from those days, and&#13;
there is no point is repeating whnat's in the documents, but I'd he grateful if you'd say whatever comes&#13;
to your mind about the whole general issue of the relations between the Bank and UNCfAD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Well, for one thing, you have the Horowitz report, that's the last formal bit of paper that&#13;
went to governments and perished, in effect. It may have bubbled up once or twice after that, and in&#13;
fact, as I recoUect Governor Horowitz modified his proposal slightly. But relationship to UNCfAD?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes just to identify, Horowitz was the Governor-Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Governor of the Bank. He was the Governor of the World Bank for Israel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And he was also, was he not, the Chairman of the Central Bank of Israel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes, he was then. And usually it is the Governor of the Central Bank, or sometimes it's the&#13;
Minister of F"mance, who sits for Israel on the Bank's Board of Governors. He made the proposal--you&#13;
know what it is, so I don't have to go throu~ it. Governor Horowitz saw it as an easier approach to&#13;
the raising of money for concessionallending by IDA. And when I say easier, I mean easier to get&#13;
&amp;#12;.&#13;
â&#128;¢&#13;
    BOSKEY                                              -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    [BOSKEY]&#13;
    through politically while providing increased resources. Easier in both terms. And the request to&#13;
    consider this proposal came to the Bank from UNCI'AD, which is the UN Conference on Trade and&#13;
    Development. It adopted many resolutions addressed to the Bank, asking the Bank to make a study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      You mentioned Irving Friedman and supplementary fmancing, which was another of those&#13;
    proposals. Committees of UNCI'AD also would ask the Bank to study one subject or another from&#13;
    time to time, and we were usually quite responsive to the requests. It was rather different from the&#13;
    resolutions adopted saying that the Bank should stop lending to South Africa or Portugal or do a&#13;
    number of things which it was not doing anyway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      We took the Horowitz proposal very seriously and analyzed it very carefully, without reaching any&#13;
    conclusion about it. We took the same approach that we took on the investment guarantee scheme,&#13;
    which was to see what issues were raised for governments rather than to say you are to do this or you&#13;
    are to do that. But it would be very disingenuous to say that we were positive. Our study noted all the&#13;
    difficulties in the way, pointed them out for the governments' attention: you don't really characterize&#13;
    that as an affirmative kind of study. So we didn't say don't do it or you can't do it, but we said it's going&#13;
    to be pretty hard for you to do it. But the real issue was: is this in fact easier, more politically&#13;
    palatable, than the way you normally handle appropriations? And the answer which never came back&#13;
    in so many words, but can be implied from what happened is: no, it is not easier. And for that reason&#13;
    it simply died. The difficulties were that governments would have to make a long-term commitment to&#13;
    provide funds, and for many governments it's not constitutionally possible to make a commitment for&#13;
    more than one year to the next. Or, if they make the commitment, it isn't worth very much in the&#13;
    longer years. And, in addition, this would be a steadily rising commitment because if--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OUVER: It wasn't a commitment in the sense of a direct payment as in the case of IDA, but it was a&#13;
    commitment to guarantee bonds which would be sold to private investors. Is that not correct?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BOSKEY: No. It's true that bonds were going to be sold to private investors. But the monies&#13;
&amp;#12;    â&#128;¢&#13;
'&#13;
..&#13;
.Â·      BOSK.EY                                            -32-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (BOSKEY]&#13;
        which were being raised were going to be re-lent on concessional terms. The commitment of&#13;
        governments was to subsidize the interest, the difference between what it cost to borrow in the market&#13;
        and the interest paid on the loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        OUVER: So the direct payments would have been the interest subsidies?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        BOSK.EY: The commitment would be to contribute every year to an interest equalization fund.&#13;
        Unless you had an exact identity between the terms of borrowing and the term of lending--which was&#13;
        probably impossible--you were going to have to keep increasing the subsidy each year. And those were&#13;
        the two, as I remember it--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        OUVER: And there would have been no point in charging the same interest to the borrowers as had&#13;
        been paid to the lenders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        BOSKEY: No, because the whole idea of this was that it should be on IDA terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        OUVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        BOSK.EY: There were a number of subsidiary issues such as which entity was to be the borrowing&#13;
        agent--IDA directly, or the Bank. And could you go into the market without additional guarantees?&#13;
        Wouldn't governments have had to increase their guarantees, in addition to the guarantees they had&#13;
        already given under the Bank Articles of Agreement, and so forth. There were a number of other&#13;
        issues but those were the principal ones. And the governments just concluded that, without regard to&#13;
        what they were going to contribute to IDA directly, whether they would ever reach the sums that were&#13;
        contemplated here, or even the sums that Horowitz reduced his proposal to later on, they just said this&#13;
        is--they didn't say it was a gimmick, but that was the idea. And they said this really is not any easier for&#13;
        us; in fact, for some governments it was constitutionally impossible. And so it simply died.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        OUVER: I think it's interesting that the amounts he was talking about, on the order of $3 billion a&#13;
        year, that he hoped might be made available to IDA in this way came very close to the number that the&#13;
        Bank staff, the economic staff, came up with independently as to the amount of concessional aid that&#13;
        the world could usefully use. Though it never proposed that it all be made available through IDA.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                              -33-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: IDA, no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But it's hoping it would be done in part by direct bilateral grants from wealthier&#13;
governments and that sort of thing. But the number $3 billion a year--$2 to $3 billion a year&#13;
concessional aid was very much in the air at this time, apparently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: But, you know, when you say in the air, again I have a vague recollection that there were a&#13;
lot of critics of the Bank's study--not the Horowitz study--who seemed to say that that figure had in&#13;
effect been plucked out of the air, that whatever we carne up with--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. Well, there were a number of people at the time who were attempting to solve this&#13;
problem econometrically, but their numbers I am told ranged anywhere from $1 billion to $10 billion a&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Very likely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So that was not a whole lot more precise. It's not as though there is ever any totally correct&#13;
number.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But you spent a fair amount of time on this, did you not, for a period of six months to a&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes, I think it was less than a year, but it was a fair amount of time because first we&#13;
canvassed the views of bankers in Europe and New York to see whether they thought this money could&#13;
be raised additional to whatever the Bank might need for its own purposes. And then there was the&#13;
writing of the report itself, which was a fairly full dress production, and all sorts interim reports to&#13;
UNCfAD or committees of UNCfAD on what we were doing and when we expected to have the fmal&#13;
results. I took part in the canvass and was a principal author of the report. And so it went on for a&#13;
long time. And nothing, nothing that's associated with the UN ever really dies. It wouldn't surprise me&#13;
at all to see it come up again. Or something like it.&#13;
&amp;#12;BOSKEY                                             -34-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Somebody else's proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Somebody else can have it, can read the old memoranda which maybe I'll settle down&#13;
myself and read sometime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you happen to remember what Mr. Woods' personal reaction to this was?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: I don't really. I suppose he had one, but I truly don't remember. I don't remember&#13;
discussing it with him or being in his presence when it was discussed. There probably are in the files-&#13;
Â· no, I don't know. I was going to say there would be--there might be letters or memos that he had&#13;
signed, but I am sure the official position would have just been: here is the report, not really taking a&#13;
position. And so I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Your memorandum mentions that there was a lunch given for Governor Horowitz, at which&#13;
some of these things were discussed, and that Mr. Woods indicated he thought this would increase the&#13;
difficulty the Bank would have in borrowing in the market. This is something that he would very likely&#13;
have had a pretty good feel for since that had been his position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BOSKEY: Yes. And institutionally that was certainly a major concern of the Bank's, because when&#13;
Irving and I went off to talk to the bankers, we put to them the question: If the Bank proposes to&#13;
borrow X amount for its own needs in this next year, do you think that the Bank, or IDA--it's the same&#13;
thing in the end--can borrow Y amount on top of that? Would the market support that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I have the feeling that in the end not ouly this proposal but the Supplementary Finance&#13;
Proposal died because it was supposed that there really is a ceiling on the amount that governments&#13;
can be induced to provide for development assistance of all kinds regardless of the approach, and that&#13;
between the Bank directly and IDA directly plus the various regional banks and so on, developed&#13;
country governments felt that they were making available as much as they were going to and gimmicks&#13;
weren't going to change that situation.&#13;
&amp;#12;'                                                    -36-&#13;
    BOSKEY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (BOSKEY)&#13;
    participation at meetings of UN agency heads, where I several times sat in the place of the President of&#13;
    the Bank. And on several occasions I wrote, and read, the Bank's speech to the Economic and Social&#13;
    Council in Geneva. This was during the McNamara era, by which time I was a Department Director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: Well, it seems to me it's been a very interesting interview. I can well understand why Mr.&#13;
    Woods would have spoken of you as his poet, because you speak with great lucidity. It's going to be a&#13;
    easy interview to transcribe I think, because every sentence has a beginning and an end and it makes it&#13;
    sense.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BOSKEY: I hope it turns out that way when it comes out. I don't think it always does.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: I think it will in this case. Thank you so much for your time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    BOSKEY: You're very welcome. You're very welcome. Thank you for reminding me of all this.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In July 1986, Shirley E. Boskey was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Professor Robert W. Oliver. During her
            tenure at the Bank from 1954-1983, Mrs. Boskey worked in the
            following areas: in the development services department as a
            policy planning officer and policy planning advisor
            (1954-1975); and in the international relations department
            as director (1975-1983).Her transcript concerns her arrival
            at the World Bank after serving in the U.S. Government as
            Assistant General Counsel of the Office of Territories in
            the Interior Department; her comparison of the presidents of
            the World Bank during her tenure; and her precedence of
            becoming the first woman department director in 1975 to deal
            with the relationship of the World Bank with the United Nations.
