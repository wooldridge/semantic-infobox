BORROWER AND         The Republic of Nicaragua&#13;

OBJECTIVES:           The purpose of this operation, which constitutes the&#13;
third stage of the FISE program, is to continue the&#13;
current operations of FISE II for the financing of&#13;
small social infrastructure projects and the stepping&#13;
up of basic sanitation projects.  In addition, it is&#13;
proposed (i) to intensify the search for new lines of&#13;
complementary projects that meet existing basic needs&#13;
to reinforce the strategy of fighting poverty;&#13;
(ii) to support programs for making the projects&#13;
sustainable; (iii) to increase the participation by&#13;
civil society in undertakings for its own community&#13;
development and in the modernization of government;&#13;
and (iv) to target efforts on the more depressed&#13;
areas,  with  special  attention  to  the  Atlantic&#13;
Autonomous Region (RAA).&#13;
DESCRIPTION:          The   program   has    the    following   components:&#13;
(i) investments    in   projects    for    small-scale&#13;
infrastructure, equipment and community promotion&#13;
needed to support the delivery of basic services;&#13;
(ii) institutional strengthening of FISE to continue&#13;
sustaining the executing unit and improving its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
internal efficiency, and (iii) a maintenance fund to&#13;
keep the investments sustainable.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL        The Environment Committee, at its meeting of Septem-&#13;
CLASSIFICATION:      ber 1,  1994,  classified  this  as  a  Category III&#13;
operation.&#13;
BENEFITS:            This   operation   will   contribute   to   alleviating&#13;
poverty, promoting the formation of human capital,&#13;
and satisfying the basic needs of the population.&#13;
This operation will serve as a catalyst for the&#13;
acquisition  of  resources  from  other  international&#13;
sources of finance. FISE has a tentative budget, for&#13;
its three-year operations program (1995-1997), of&#13;
US$104.2 million, to be obtained from the following&#13;
sources:   (i) US$50.0 million from the World Bank;&#13;
(ii) US$9.7 million from the KfW; (iii) US$9.5 mil-&#13;
lion from USAID, and (iv) US$40.0 million - 38% of&#13;
the total - from the IDB.&#13;
RISKS:                Given the fiscal austerity and operating deficiencies&#13;
of the public agencies, the risk of deterioration of&#13;
the installations built with FISE resources is&#13;
heightened by the lack of preventive maintenance of&#13;
the infrastructural works built.  A maintenance fund&#13;
is established for this purpose and support to&#13;
community programs is stressed.&#13;
FISE's lack of institutional capacity to diversify&#13;
the menu of new types of complementary projects that&#13;
satisfy the unmet basic needs of the population, in&#13;
accordance with social priorities, is a constraint on&#13;
accomplishment of the program's basic objectives.&#13;
The program provides for institutional strengthening&#13;
by setting up a fund for studies under the Office of&#13;
the  Director  for  Promotion  and  the  creation  of a&#13;
Coiuimunications Unit.&#13;
The proximity of the elections could entail a risk in&#13;
the allocation of resources in accordance with social&#13;
priorities.   The targeting scheme adopted by FISE,&#13;
the timetable for provision of the resources, and the&#13;
inventory  of  projects  evaluated  without  financing&#13;
will all help reduce the risk of the operation.&#13;
THE BANK'S           The Bank has worked out its strategy with the Govern-&#13;
COUNTRY AND          ment of Nicaragua with a view  to reactivating  the&#13;
SECTOR STRATEGY:      traditional  production  sectors,  increasing  foreign&#13;
exchange receipts, reducing unemployment, and alle-&#13;
viating  poverty.    In  view  of  the  prevalence  of&#13;
poverty in the country, it is recommended that the&#13;
poverty  alleviation  strategy be  comprehensive,  and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
address institutional, structural and policy aspects.&#13;
This strategy emphasizes that FISE will remain the&#13;
best vehicle to target poverty alleviation in the&#13;
short run because of its institutional and technical&#13;
capabilities and its systems, which are well-suited&#13;
for transparent resource allocation.&#13;

I.  FRAME OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
1.1   Since the project described herein is a continuation of operation&#13;
729/OC, which the Bank recently approved for the FISE and is still&#13;
in execution,  this document is presented in shortened form.   The&#13;
present operation focuses on evaluation of the gains made by the&#13;
program in execution, and contains a description of the new pro-&#13;
gram, with the adjustments required to make it more efficient. The&#13;
aspects relating to the program's institutional framework and&#13;
operating arrangement have not been included in detail because&#13;
those presented for the loan in execution remain valid.&#13;
B.   Economic situation and the stabilization and structural adjustment&#13;
program&#13;
1.2   The economy of Nicaragua has undergone profound changes after a&#13;
decade  of  deep  stagnation.    The  stabilization  and  structural&#13;
adjustment program launched in 1990 has made important gains:&#13;
(i) inflation dropped to 20% in 1993 from more than 7,000% in 1990;&#13;
(ii) the size of the government has been reduced with the&#13;
privatization of 253 government enterprises, the release of 60,000&#13;
men from the army and the removal of 10,000 public posts from the&#13;
central government's payroll, and (iii) structural reforms have&#13;
been made in the trade and finance sectors with the establishment&#13;
of legal frameworks for the establishment of private banking and&#13;
the  Superintendency of Banks.   In addition,  the government has&#13;
carried out a variety of programs targeted at low-income groups,&#13;
which have generated about 90,000 jobs under temporary programs.&#13;
At present the Government of Nicaragua is beginning a modernization&#13;
of the State under a public sector reform program.&#13;
1.3   Despite these gains, it has not been possible to sustain economic&#13;
development. With the lack of economic growth, together with high&#13;
growth of the population, unemployment has risen to 21.8%, which&#13;
has added to the poverty in the country.&#13;
1.4   In 1993 GDP fell 0.9%.  Agriculture was affected by the decline of&#13;
international prices, and production fell off in almost all manu-&#13;
facturing subsectors.   A modest  recovery  of economic  growth  is&#13;
expected in 1994, estimated at 2% of GDP and generated by a recov-&#13;
ery of animal production, fishing and plant production.&#13;
C.   The social framework&#13;
1.5   The low welfare level of the Nicaraguan population is reflected in&#13;
substandard basic services and a high incidence of poverty.   The&#13;
per capita GDP is the lowest in Latin America after Haiti and&#13;
Guyana.   The  indicators  of health,  nutrition and education are&#13;
among the lowest in the region.   Some 28% of the children suffer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
from some form of malnutrition.   Infant mortality stands at 72 per&#13;
1,000   live   births,   caused  mainly  by   preventable   diseases&#13;
(diarrhea), which are associated with a shortage of drinking water&#13;
and  sanitation.    Maternal  mortality  is  159  per  100,000  live&#13;
births - the highest in Central America.   The social problems are&#13;
aggravated by a population growth rate of 3.3% a year.&#13;
1.6   The  school  drop-out  and repeater  rates  are  the highest  in the&#13;
region.   Only 22% of the children who enter first grade complete&#13;
their primary schooling. Some 23% of the population is illiterate,&#13;
and this proportion is higher among the extremely poor, who are 51%&#13;
illiterate.   In the urban population the level of illiteracy is&#13;
higher among women than among men.&#13;
1.7   About 46% of the country's population has no safe drinking water&#13;
supply,  and in the countryside  the figure  is only 20%.   It is&#13;
estimated that 82% of the national population is affected by prob-&#13;
lems of sewage and human waste disposal.&#13;
1.8   In addition  to  the  country's very  poor  performance  on  leading&#13;
social indicators, there are constraints on expenditures for social&#13;
purposes and institutional limitations that reduce managerial capa-&#13;
bilities.   The social ministries are in critical need of institu-&#13;
tional reform if a social program is to be designed that can check&#13;
the drastic decline in services that are essential for the develop-&#13;
ment of human capital.&#13;
D.   The government's social strate&amp;y&#13;
1.9   The terms of a social strategy of the Government of Nicaragua for&#13;
the short run were formulated in October 1992. A Social Agenda for&#13;
1993-1996 sets out the basic principles of the social function.&#13;
The proposal sets the following purposes:   (i) to provide for the&#13;
poorest and most vulnerable population; (ii) to make basic services&#13;
more efficient and effective; and (iii) to support the production&#13;
sectors that are excluded from the formal market.   The strategic&#13;
criteria for implementation of the Social Agenda are: (i) adminis-&#13;
trative and financial decentralization, (ii) promotion of the&#13;
community and its participation in the identification of needs,&#13;
(iii) coordination between the central government and the local&#13;
governments, (iv) the targeting of resources, and (v) rehabilita-&#13;
tion of existing and construction of new physical capacity in the&#13;
primary care and education facilities and child-care centers.&#13;
1.10  Within the framework established by the government's Social Agenda&#13;
for 1993-1996, FISE has the task of continuing to mitigate the&#13;
critical situation evidenced by the country's social indicators&#13;
after a decade of war.   FISE operates by financing small-scale&#13;
projects to generate employment in the poorer areas by rehabili-&#13;
tating social infrastructures in education and health and extending&#13;
the network of basic water and sanitary sewerage services in rural&#13;
and marginal urban areas.   These operations respond to the basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3-&#13;
needs of the populations earning the lowest incomes and thereby&#13;
contribute to modernization of the State.&#13;
1.11  The World Bank is working with the Government of Nicaragua to chart&#13;
a medium- and long-term policy of support for the social strategy.&#13;
In addition, (i) in the education sector the World Bank and USAID&#13;
are carrying forward the program for decentralization and strength-&#13;
ening of basic education; (ii) in the health sector the IDB, in&#13;
coordination with other multilateral and bilateral agencies, is&#13;
supporting the reform of the sector, and (iii) in the sanitation&#13;
sector the IDB, through the program for rehabilitation of drinking&#13;
water supply and sewerage systems, is supporting rehabilitation of&#13;
those systems in Managua and several cities elsewhere in the coun-&#13;
try.    In  addition,  institutional  strengthening,  including  rate&#13;
studies, is being provided.&#13;
E. The Bank's strategy&#13;
1.12  The Bank has worked out its strategy with the Government of Nica-&#13;
ragua for reactivation of the traditional production sectors,&#13;
increasing foreign exchange receipts, reducing unemployment, and&#13;
alleviating poverty. Given the prevalence of poverty in Nicaragua,&#13;
it is recommended that the poverty alleviation strategy be compre-&#13;
hensive, and address institutional, structural and policy aspects.&#13;
This strategy emphasizes that FISE will remain the best vehicle to&#13;
target poverty alleviation in the short run because of its institu-&#13;
tional and technical capabilities and its systems, which are well-&#13;
suited for transparent resource allocation.&#13;
F.  The Emergency Social Investment Fund&#13;
1. Background&#13;
1.13  FISE was established in 1990 as a temporary autonomous institution.&#13;
It was to exist until 1995 as an instrument of social compensation&#13;
to protect the living standards of disadvantaged population groups&#13;
from the effects of structural adjustment measures.   Since despite&#13;
major success in stabilizing the economy it has not been possible&#13;
to restart economic growth and the social indicators remain at&#13;
critical levels, the Government of Nicaragua has issued an execu-&#13;
tive decree extending FISE's existence to 1997.&#13;
1.14  The Bank and other bilateral and multilateral  organizations  and&#13;
agencies, including the World Bank, USAID, CIDA, UNDP, SCD, KfW,&#13;
and IDA, have supported the institution's establishment and opera-&#13;
tions.   The Bank's contribution was of key importance in guaran-&#13;
teeing the institution's sustainability and efficiency in the&#13;
allocation of its resources to the other donors. FISE has acquired&#13;
resources totaling US$120 million, of which US$107 million are for&#13;
investments in subprojects, and US$9 million for its institutional&#13;
strengthening of itself and that of some  line ministries.   The&#13;
balance is resources to cover the administration agreements and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
transaction costs.   Line ministries are to be strengthened pri-&#13;
marily to improve their institutional capability for the formula-&#13;
tion and preparation of projects that can qualify for financing by&#13;
FISE.&#13;
1.15  The  Bank  contributed  US$4 million  under  technical-cooperation&#13;
operation ATN/TF-3599-NI to set in motion the organization of the&#13;
Fund and the execution of pilot projects in which criteria and&#13;
methodologies for its operation were framed.  This cooperation has&#13;
been fully committed and executed.&#13;
1.16  In December 1992, the Bank's Board of Executive Directors approved&#13;
loan 729/OC-NI, in the amount of US$16.3 million, for a second&#13;
program.   The loan agreement was signed on March 9, 1993.   This&#13;
second stage covers US$12.2 million in financing for projects and&#13;
US$4.1 million for the institutional strengthening of FISE and the&#13;
ministries  involved  in  its operations.    At  this writing  those&#13;
resources  have  been  88%  committed  and  68.62%  disbursed.    The&#13;
resources for the projects component have been committed in their&#13;
entirety, and the institutional strengthening component recently&#13;
entered the contracting phase.&#13;
1.17  The reason for the slow take-off of the institutional strengthening&#13;
component is that at this stage FISE focused institutional efforts&#13;
on consolidating the execution of the component for investments in&#13;
the existing types of projects.   FISE has now succeeded in this&#13;
consolidation and, on the basis of the experience acquired, has&#13;
redefined the consultancies in general terms in accordance with its&#13;
needs. These consultancies have been established for the develop-&#13;
ment of new types of projects that will support basic needs and&#13;
complement  the  principal  types  of eligible  projects.    All  the&#13;
envisaged consultancies are expected to be contracted for before&#13;
the end of the year.&#13;
1.18  The  institutional  strengthening of the line ministries  (MED and&#13;
MINSA) to support their capabilities for the formulation of&#13;
projects  compatible with FISE's project evaluation criteria and&#13;
disciplines was delayed because when the program began to be&#13;
executed those ministries were in process of modernization and the&#13;
consolidation of FISE referred to in the preceding paragraph was in&#13;
progress.   At this writing MED and MINSA have set the decentrali-&#13;
zation in motion and institutional strengthening has been resumed.&#13;
Headway was made recently in the contracting of consultancies for&#13;
MED, and negotiations with MINSA for the purpose are in progress.&#13;
1.19  FISE  services  several  sectors  and  types  of  projects,  but  its&#13;
operations have focused on the sectors of education (49%), health&#13;
(18%), and drinking water and sanitation (5%).  The remaining 28%&#13;
covers, among other things, projects for production infrastructure&#13;
and the environment.   It may be noted that in the education and&#13;
health projects FISE executes only repair and replacement works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Projects executed by FISE may not add to recurring costs of the&#13;
public sector.&#13;
2. Execution of the program&#13;
1.20 With completion of the institution's consolidation, which slowed&#13;
the startup of the Fund's initial stage, since the second quarter&#13;
of 1994 the volume of operations has exceeded the targets of the&#13;
program in execution, as can be seen by analysis of the performance&#13;
indicators presented in Annex I-1.  This was made possible by the&#13;
instruction and training given to the institution's professional&#13;
and technical staff and the permanence of their positions.   As a&#13;
result, the resources of the investment component of loan 729/OC,&#13;
with an execution completion deadline of June 1995, are already&#13;
fully committed.&#13;
1.21 Since it commenced operations, FISE has received 4,127 projects&#13;
aggregating US$101.4 million, of which 3,367, totaling about&#13;
US$80 million, have been evaluated.  Of the latter projects, 2,043&#13;
totaling US$58.1 million have been contracted for, and US$49 mil-&#13;
lion has been disbursed to the contractors.   It is expected that&#13;
95% of the funds available for projects will have been disbursed by&#13;
December 1994, which will leave FISE without resources for fresh&#13;
financings.  Meanwhile, there is already a project pipeline aggre-&#13;
gating about US$55 million, of which projects totaling US$20 mil-&#13;
lion have been evaluated and projects adding up to US$25 million&#13;
are ready for evaluation.   The rest of the projects are in the&#13;
stage of eligibility determination. This has prompted FISE to seek&#13;
resources for a third phase that would require about US$105 mil-&#13;
lion. . The Bank would begin the process by participating in a&#13;
program for US$44 million.&#13;
1.22 The actual execution capacity ranges between US$30 and US$40 mil-&#13;
lion  in  contracts  representing  1,200  to  1,500  projects.    The&#13;
institution's administrative costs represent 9.5% of disbursements&#13;
in the first half of 1994, one of the lowest for funds in the&#13;
region.&#13;
3. Accomplishments&#13;
1.23 The accomplishments of the program have been examined in terms of&#13;
its institutional efficiency, the coverage of its projects, the&#13;
quality of its works, and the magnitude of FISE's presence in the&#13;
social sector.&#13;
a. Institutional efficiency&#13;
1.24 FISE has attained quite a satisfactory level of institutional&#13;
success.   According to its performance  indicators,  in the third&#13;
quarter of 1994 it had made substantial progress towards its&#13;
targets (see paragraph 1.16 and Annex I-1).   Its operating costs&#13;
are quite reasonable,  as noted in paragraph 1.17.   The mid-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
report of the World Bank mission states that FISE's institutional&#13;
success is owed primarily to (i) the priority it has been given at&#13;
high policy-making levels of the government, (ii) the contractual&#13;
facilities (market.-competitive remuneration for its personnel and&#13;
flexible procedures for the award and contracting of works) allowed&#13;
by  its  charter  law,  and  (iii) the  professional  quality  of  its&#13;
staff.   It is also worth noting that the eligibility and selection&#13;
criteria and evaluation methodologies have been rigorously applied.&#13;
1.25  Since  its inception,  FISE has made  great efforts  to target  its&#13;
resources to respond to the basic needs of the poorest. To program&#13;
the distribution of its resources, the institution has designed a&#13;
geographical targeting strategy in which it allocates them to the&#13;
municipal level.   This strategy has been based on a per capita&#13;
distribution adjusted by poverty indicators (including access to&#13;
drinking water, malnutrition, and displaced population), so that&#13;
the country's poorest municipalities benefit proportionally the&#13;
most from the project financing.   FISE has constructed a poverty&#13;
map that constitutes a contribution to the strategy for the social&#13;
sector.   Under the proposed operation this poverty map would be&#13;
updated.&#13;
b. Project coverage&#13;
1.26  Although the institution was established only a short time ago, its&#13;
effects are already being reflected in benefits to the target&#13;
population.   The program has covered all 143 existing municipal-&#13;
ities and is estimated to have generated 12,780 employment years.&#13;
The works contracted for have benefitted 3,321,731 persons. Based&#13;
on the low-income threshold agreed upon between the government and&#13;
the Bank, 100% of the target population is below the poverty line&#13;
(US$960.00 per capita/year).   The real cumulative  investment per&#13;
beneficiary in the categories of extreme, severe and moderate pov-&#13;
erty is US$24.20, US$17.40 and US$14.50, respectively. The opera-&#13;
tion meets the poverty reduction criterion specified in the report&#13;
on the Eighth General Increase of the Bank, since low-income groups&#13;
account for 50 percent of the country's population, making for a&#13;
coefficienc of greater than 2 in terms of low-income beneficiaries.&#13;
1.27  Up to September  1994,  FISE had provided for 15% of the primary&#13;
schools in the country (more than 4,000 schools, most of them in a&#13;
deteriorating state) by repairing or rehabilitating 602 primary&#13;
school and preschool buildings and providing 249,129 desks. It has&#13;
improved the educational conditions of 171,505 children for whose&#13;
education even the minimum requirements were not present before the&#13;
project.   Direct benefits have been received by 66% of the rural&#13;
and 34% of the urban schools either in buildings or equipment. In&#13;
addition, FISE has carried out 55 secondary-school projects, which&#13;
have benefitted 36,519 students.&#13;
1.28 FISE has also executed 148 health post projects, which are benefit-&#13;
ing 550,240 families, most of them in the countryside.   The works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
for repair or rehabilitation of health posts have improved the&#13;
quality  of  the  care  of  patients,  chiefly  newborn  and  nursing&#13;
infants and expectant mothers, who had previously been seen in&#13;
makeshift premises, many of which fell short of the required tech-&#13;
nical health standards.&#13;
1.29 FISE has stood out as an entity able to channel resources to small&#13;
social projects executed by private contractors rapidly, effi-&#13;
ciently and transparently. The country has about 1,500 contracting&#13;
firms, of which 820, consisting mainly of builders (45%), profes-&#13;
sionals and firms (40%), and microentrepreneurs (15%), have&#13;
executed contracts with FISE.&#13;
1.30 FISE has begun to work with community groups to set up maintenance&#13;
committees and boards and, although this line of activity is only&#13;
starting, it is already yielding satisfactory results. A community&#13;
survey has found a strong willingness to contribute to the routine&#13;
maintenance of the projects in 91.6% of the homes surveyed.   FISE&#13;
has developed community participation projects in the sectors of&#13;
education, health and basic sanitation, including basic preventive&#13;
health projects.   The lessons learned from these experiences have&#13;
been positive,  for  the more  the  community  participates  in  the&#13;
identification of its own needs, the better the supervision and&#13;
upkeep of the works.&#13;
1.31  The  impact  on women  is considerable.   Women's  participation  is&#13;
estimated at above 50% in education projects and at 65% in those&#13;
for health  posts.    These  sectors  account  for  the bulk of  the&#13;
program.&#13;
1.32 The program in progress included a study of the environmental&#13;
impact of the projects that qualify for financing under it.  This&#13;
study indicated that those projects have an adverse environmental&#13;
impact during execution and a highly positive impact when they go&#13;
into operation.   The adverse  impacts are all of moderate or low&#13;
magnitude, temporary and local, and can be mitigated by measures&#13;
that are simple  to carry out.   Under the present operation,  an&#13;
environimental impact assessment will be made of a sample of proj-&#13;
ects executed under FISE II to verify compliance with the environ-&#13;
mental  criteria  and,  if necessary,  to make  adjustments  in  the&#13;
manuals.   The results of this evaluation will be implemented by&#13;
FISE within the first year following the entry into force of the&#13;
contract.&#13;
c.  Quality of the works&#13;
1.33  In July 1994,  the Country Office contracted for a consultancy to&#13;
make an inspection of a sample of 30 education and health projects&#13;
in different parts of the country.  The results of this consultancy&#13;
confirmed that the works are, in general, satisfactory, meet their&#13;
technical specifications, and are being used for their intended&#13;
purposes.   Nevertheless,  in some cases shortcomings were found in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
the upkeep of the works, owing in some cases to the poor quality of&#13;
the materials and labor. Anothe-r point mentioned was the need for&#13;
additional works that had not been provided for in order not to&#13;
exceed the parameters established with the efficiency indicators.&#13;
It is proposed to correct these matters under the present operation&#13;
(see paragraph 3.9).&#13;
1.34  As part of the analysis of this operation,  visits were paid to&#13;
health posts and education facilities, which confirmed the findings&#13;
of the consultancy and the improvement in the quality of service&#13;
both by the personnel in charge of the services and by the benefi-&#13;
ciaries.  The visits also found that both the direct beneficiaries&#13;
and those in charge of the services were highly receptive.&#13;
d. FISE and the social sectors&#13;
1.35  As noted  in paragraph 1.10,  FISE has significant  impact on the&#13;
social agenda.   It is supporting decentralization as part of the&#13;
modernization  of  the  public  sector.    Under  a  nonreimbursable&#13;
technical-cooperation operation provided for under the program, a&#13;
study would be made of the part to be played by FISE in the social&#13;
strategy over the longer run (see paragraph 2.7).&#13;
1.36  Interinstitutional  coordination with  the  line ministries  assures&#13;
FISE's support for the execution of works for low-income popula-&#13;
tions.  It is becoming an increasingly important participant in the&#13;
social reform process as an executing agency.   Indeed, MED is now&#13;
negotiating to transfer its functions as executing agency to FISE&#13;
under  a  management  contract.       It  is  hoped  that  other  line&#13;
ministries will follow suit and adopt this arrangement as well.&#13;
4. Weaknesses&#13;
1.37  The analysis of the present operation has identified a series of&#13;
needs for institutional strengthening to improve some of the&#13;
institution's functions and procedures at different stages of the&#13;
project cycle.   These  improvements are needed in monitoring and&#13;
control, project diversification, and the evaluation of some types&#13;
of projects.   Resources have been provided in the institutional&#13;
strengthening component of FISE III for the improvement of these&#13;
aspects (see paragraph 2.5.b).   In addition, minor changes in the&#13;
institutional structure were approved during the analysis of the&#13;
operation (see paragraph 3.3).&#13;
1.38  FISE has not yet received  the findings of an evaluation of the&#13;
impact  and level of participation by communities.   But  this  is&#13;
because of the slowness of execution at the beginning of the&#13;
previous  program.   At present  FISE  is contracting  for parallel&#13;
monitoring, which would be continued under the IDB-FISE III opera-&#13;
tion using the nonreimbursable technical-cooperation funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1.39 During the analysis of the operation the Ministry of Social Action&#13;
and the Instituto Nicaragaense de Agua y Alcantarillado [Nicaraguan&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority] (INAA) stressed the need for&#13;
more action by FISE in the sanitation sector owing to the large&#13;
coverage shortfall and low participation in the program in execu-&#13;
tion  (see paragraphs  1.5 and  1.7).   In addition,  the  analysis&#13;
brought out problems in the institutional capacity of the executing&#13;
agencies and the need for a review of economic methodologies. This&#13;
makes it necessary to provide training to strengthen the executing&#13;
agencies.   FISE is now hiring consultants to review the evaluation&#13;
methodologies.   Also, the institutional strengthening component of&#13;
FISE III provides resources for continuing this work.&#13;
1.40  It has been found  that the strategy  is in need of revision  to&#13;
ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  investments,  specifically  in&#13;
regard to the maintenance problem.   To this end the program is&#13;
considering   two  measures:       (i) community  participation,   and&#13;
(ii) the establishment of a maintenance fund.   The former measure&#13;
is only a partial solution owing to the poverty of the communities&#13;
and their limited capacity to generate income in the short run. It&#13;
would  therefore be  complemented by  the maintenance  fund,  which&#13;
would be taken over gradually by the government with the partial&#13;
support of the communities as they are demonstrated to have the&#13;
resources for these activities (see paragraphs 2.6 and 3.13).&#13;
1.41 It has turned out that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have&#13;
participated as the executing agencies and operators of only 1% of&#13;
the projects. The reason for this is that NGOs work essentially in&#13;
community promotion projects, which are only now beginning to be&#13;
developed under the program. FISE commissioned a consultancy using&#13;
institutional strengthening resources, to strengthen the participa-&#13;
tion of NGOs and improve coordination with them,  The recominenda-&#13;
tions produced by this consultancy led to the setting up of the&#13;
Communications Unit under the present program (see paragraph 3.3).&#13;
&#13;

II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.   Objectives&#13;
2.1   The main objective of the program is to continue supporting Nicara-&#13;
gua in the alleviation and reduction of poverty by financing proj-&#13;
ects for small-scale works in the sectors of health, education and&#13;
basic sanitation.   At this new stage, sanitation operations would&#13;
be stepped up and, in addition to the actions already in progress&#13;
under FISE II, the program would (i) intensify the search for new&#13;
complementary lines of projects to satisfy existing basic needs by&#13;
strengthening the strategy of fighting poverty, (ii) give support&#13;
to programs to make the projects sustainable, (iii) step up the&#13;
participation of civil society in its community development under-&#13;
takings and in the modernization of the State, and (iv) target&#13;
efforts at the most depressed areas, wich special attention to the&#13;
RAA.&#13;
B.   Components of the program&#13;
2.2   To accomplish the above-stated purpose,  the following components&#13;
would be executed:&#13;
1. Investment component (US$35.6 million)&#13;
2.3   This  component would continue  the  financing of projects  in the&#13;
health and education sectors, including equipment and basic sanita-&#13;
tion. It would also finance environmental protection projects. It&#13;
would intensify the financing of projects for (i) sanitation to&#13;
reduce the existing deficit, (ii) community promotion and develop-&#13;
ment to promote the participation of civil society in the mainte-&#13;
nance of physical investments, and (iii) other purposes that meet&#13;
basic needs of the community as they are pronounced eligible pur-&#13;
suant to the provisions of the Operating Regulations.   The latter&#13;
projects  include  market  rehabilitation,  small  local  slaughter-&#13;
houses, reforestation, school vegetable gardens, energy-saving&#13;
stoves, measures in support of children, kits of school supplies,&#13;
and minilibraries.&#13;
2.4   The program would also intensify its operations in the RAA in new&#13;
projects additional to those already developed by FISE to support&#13;
one of the most depressed and isolated regions, which is being&#13;
serviced by the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID)  until  the end of  1994.   It  is expected  that at least&#13;
US$3 million may be used for new types of projects, especially for&#13;
access roads and reforestation, which are of fundamental importance&#13;
to this  region.   The utilization of resources  for new types of&#13;
projects would depend on whether the eligibility, selection and&#13;
evaluation criteria are compatible with those currently in use by&#13;
the FISE-IDB program.  During the analysis mission, it was decided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
that, in the short run, a short-term consultancy would be provided&#13;
to support FISE in revising the proposal of new projects for the&#13;
RAA  by  preparing  a  sample  as  a basis  for  establishing  those&#13;
criteria.&#13;
2. Institutional strengthening component (US$4.2 million)&#13;
2.5   This component would comprise:&#13;
a. financing for a core group of management and professional&#13;
personnel and other inputs needed to maintain the executing&#13;
unit until 1997;&#13;
b.  resources for updating the poverty map, for updating the cost&#13;
system, and for holding workshops, seminars and studies needed&#13;
to improve the Fund's internal efficiency and to extend and&#13;
improve its promotion work;&#13;
C. resources for decentralization of the promotion, control and&#13;
monitoring operations in the RAA in an effort to reach a larger&#13;
number of projects in the sectors traditionally financed by&#13;
FISE in this area, which hitherto have been limited by the&#13;
region's isolation.   The operating scheme, required personnel&#13;
and arrangement for the transfer of resources for decentraliza-&#13;
tion of those activities are to be presented to the Bank within&#13;
six months following the entry into force of the program, and&#13;
d.  a fund for the inclusion of new projects to satisfy other basic&#13;
needs of beneficiaries, to be placed under the Office of the&#13;
Director for Promotion.   Funds would be made available for the&#13;
performance of studies to validate some of the methodologies&#13;
developed internally by FISE and for the development of new&#13;
methodologies.   In addition,  internships would be financed to&#13;
promote the preparation of new types of projects developed in&#13;
other countries of the region which have been successful in&#13;
fighting poverty. The amount of this fund is US$100,000. The&#13;
fund would be created in response to the need to modify the&#13;
approach taken for the operation in execution.   The original&#13;
design  called  for  execution  through  external  coordination,&#13;
which has not functioned as planned.&#13;
3. Maintenance fund (US$885.000)&#13;
2.6   This component would set up a fund to cover the needs for mainte-&#13;
nance of the investments carried out under education and health&#13;
projects  during  the  execution  period.    The  resources  would  be&#13;
transferred to the organized beneficiary communities and to the&#13;
trustees of schools and maintenance boards under the technical&#13;
supervision of the line ministries (MINSA and MED). The fund would&#13;
be scaled down during the execution period so as to gradually&#13;
transfer the responsibility for maintenance to the country. In the&#13;
course of the operation, the central government could transfer the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
responsibility for this function to the local government and the&#13;
community when decentralization had progressed to the required&#13;
extent and the community was able to earn income.&#13;
2.7   The  program also  includes  a parallel  nonreimbursable  technical-&#13;
cooperation operation for US$300,000 in support of the preparation&#13;
of studies to define the future role of FISE and the implementation&#13;
of a monitoring system.&#13;
a. Regarding the future role of FISE and its coordination with the&#13;
sector's governing agencies, the purposes of the consultancy&#13;
would be:   (i) to determine whether FISE should be terminated&#13;
or continue beyond 1997, on the basis of the support it is&#13;
giving to the social strategy in its coordination with the line&#13;
ministries, its efficiency as the executing agency for small&#13;
infrastructure works, and an analysis of the results and impact&#13;
of its projects; (ii) if it is decided not to keep FISE in&#13;
operation, to study the mechanism for the transfer of its&#13;
functions and experience to other government institutions; and&#13;
(iii) if it is decided to keep the Fund in operation, to&#13;
consider different options for its institutional redefinition&#13;
and duration, and to select the organizational, legal and&#13;
financial structure that is most workable and suited to attain&#13;
the goals of the social policy and reform program of the public&#13;
sector. The performance of this study and compliance with its&#13;
recommendations would be a condition precedent to application&#13;
for further financing from the Bank.&#13;
b. The purpose of the parallel monitoring system would be co sec&#13;
up a periodic reporting system that would enable FISE to draw&#13;
lessons from all aspects of the targeting of resources, the&#13;
quality of projects, satisfaction of the environmental crite-&#13;
ria, community participation, the sustainability of projects&#13;
and the administration of the project cycle.   This would make&#13;
it possible to compare practical results with the established&#13;
purposes and goals and to learn lessons for replication in&#13;
projects executed subsequent to the monitoring results.&#13;
2.8   In addition,  a nonreimbursable technical-cooperation operation in&#13;
the amount of US$3.3 million from the Social Progress Trust Fund&#13;
(SPTF)  is included for carrying out the population census.   The&#13;
purpose of this census is to supply a detailed socioeconomic pic-&#13;
ture of the population of each city, neighborhood and rural settle-&#13;
ment to support the Government of Nicaragua in policy-making and as&#13;
a direct aid to FISE in its work of targeting the program.   The&#13;
census  would  include  the  following  activities:         (i) updating&#13;
national maps; (ii) preparation of the methodology for the survey&#13;
and  post-census  stages;  (iii) the  enumeration,  and  (iv) comput-&#13;
erized processing and publication of the census results in the&#13;
media.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
C.   Sizing of the program&#13;
2.9   The size of the investment component  (US$35.6 million) has been&#13;
determined on the basis of:&#13;
a.  the potential demand, which was arrived at by analysis of the&#13;
projects  financed  in  the  preceding  stages,  which  exceeded&#13;
projections in terms of amounts, and which complied with- the&#13;
eligibility, selection and evaluation criteria; the present&#13;
pipeline of projects without sources of financing, which totals&#13;
US$55 million,  and the promotion of new projects.   Of these&#13;
projects, 78% are eligible for financing from the Bank.&#13;
b.  FISE's execution capacity, which in the previous stage proved&#13;
efficient, posting operating indicators better than those of&#13;
other funds (see paragraph 1.17).  The new operation calls for&#13;
a strengthened administrative structure to carry out the&#13;
program without significantly affecting operating indicators&#13;
(see paragraph 3.5), and&#13;
c.  the financial capacity to pay the counterpart contribution and&#13;
operating costs, on the basis of which the program ceiling was&#13;
determined.&#13;
2.10 The size of the institutional strengthening component (US$4.2 mil-&#13;
lion) was based on the needs for expansion of the executing unit to&#13;
execute a program of larger magnitude and on the resources required&#13;
to improve the entity's efficiency.&#13;
2.11 The maintenance fund (US$885,000) was established as a special&#13;
component based on the pipeline of education and health projects&#13;
that could be financed and on the needs for maintenance they would&#13;
generate under an arrangement in which the government would gradu-&#13;
ally take over the responsibility for meeting the maintenance&#13;
costs.&#13;
D. Cost and financing plan&#13;
2.12 The total cost of the program has been estimated at the equivalent&#13;
of US$44.0 million. Additional funding in the form of nonreimburs-&#13;
able technical cooperation will be available in the amount of&#13;
US$300,000 from the Fund for Special Operations, and a nonreimburs-&#13;
able technical cooperation of US$8.1 million, of which US$3.3 mil-&#13;
lion will be funded with resources from the SPTF. The breakdown by&#13;
investment categories and sources of financing are summed up in the&#13;

(US$4.0 million for the investment component and US$4.8 mil-&#13;
lion 1/ for the technical cooperation), to be put up by the&#13;
government. Grants from international agencies and organizations&#13;
may be proffered as counterpart contribucions provided that their&#13;
criteria are compatible with  the Bank's program.   In any case,&#13;
evidence must be presented that the government will provide the&#13;
counterpart contribution prior to approval by the Bank's Board of&#13;
Executive Directors, and of the budgetary allocations prior to the&#13;
first disbursement.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
III. PROGRAM EXECUTION&#13;
A.   Institutional framework&#13;
3.1   For  execution  of  the  third  stage,  the borrower,  the  executing&#13;
agency, the participants, and their interrelations will remain as&#13;
they  have  been.    The  borrower  in  this  operation  will  be- the&#13;
Republic of Nicaragua.   The proceeds of the loan and the local&#13;
counterpart contribution will be transferred by the government to&#13;
FISE under an agreement that will be a condition precedent to the&#13;
first disbursement.&#13;
3.2   Since the duration of FISE would be extended to December 12, 1997,&#13;
the executive decree ordering this extension will need to be&#13;
presented to the Bank before the loan proposal goes to the Board of&#13;
Executive Directors.&#13;
3.3   During the analysis mission,  FISE's organizational  structure was&#13;
reviewed and several viable alternatives to improve yet further the&#13;
efficiency it has attained were discussed.   As a result of these&#13;
talks, it was agreed with FISE that the following changes would be&#13;
made:   (i) move the contracting function from its present location&#13;
in the Evaluation Directorate to the status of a directorate in its&#13;
own right. The nature of the contracting function and the increase&#13;
in the volume of operations makes it advisable, for control pur-&#13;
poses, that it be separate from the project evaluation process even&#13;
though it performed well in phase II; (ii) creation of the Communi-&#13;
cation Unit to widen the public information on the program.   This&#13;
unit would devise a specialized internal mechanism to serve as a&#13;
bridge between FISE, NGOs and the other applicants;   (iii) scrength-&#13;
ening of the Internal Auditing Unit.   The program would increase&#13;
the number of professionals for the performance of a comprehensive&#13;
function which, in addition to the control function, would be&#13;
complemented with monitoring of the recommendations for internal&#13;
control.   In addition, a function is added for internal coordina-&#13;
tion in FISE of implementation and startup of the parallel project&#13;
monitoring system. The details on this new structure may be found&#13;
in the technical files of Region II.&#13;
3.4   The  institutional  analysis  also  found  a need  for  an  external&#13;
consultancy to review the functions assigned to each directorate&#13;
and the extent to which they were being carried out by comparison&#13;
with the professional profiles.   It was also considered important&#13;
to make an evaluation of the merits of the individual staff mem-&#13;
bers.    The  recommendations  generated  by  the  consultancy,  and&#13;
previously agreed upon with the Bank, must be implemented within&#13;
six months after the entry into force of the contract.&#13;
3.5   Twenty-two  additional employees are needed to carry out the new&#13;
operation, which will increase to 51 the staff members financed by&#13;
the Bank.   It is estimated  that  this additional  personnel will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
raise the institution's administrative costs from 9.5% to 10.5% of&#13;
disbursements.   This additional personnel would he hired gradually&#13;
in pace with the progress and in accordance with the operational&#13;
budget of the program.&#13;
B.   Interinstitutional coordination&#13;
3.6   FISE has signed framework coordination agreements with the inst-itu-&#13;
tions governing the sectors - MED, MINSA and INAA - to facilitate&#13;
the planning and execution of projects.   Some of the functions of&#13;
these agreements, such as those of maintenance and supervision,&#13;
are being revised to make them more operational and assign specific&#13;
responsibilities to the parties involved.  In view of these changes&#13;
and since they expire in 1995, FISE will need to present to the&#13;
Bank evidence that those agreements have been signed as a condition&#13;
precedent to the first disbursement.&#13;
3.7   Within three months following the passage into law of a current&#13;
bill on "Permits and Evaluation of Environmental Impact" and the&#13;
approval of regulations to implement it, FISE will have to enter&#13;
into a framework agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and&#13;
Natural Resources (MARENA) establishing the operational criteria,&#13;
for which it will have to have the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
C.   Execution of the program comDonents&#13;
3.8   Investment component.   FISE's operating procedures were put into&#13;
effect in 1992 with the Bank's previous loan.  The mechanisms used&#13;
for the programming (by means of criteria for the targeting and&#13;
selection of types of projects), promotion (guidance to applicants&#13;
on eligibility criteria and application of the targeting criteria),&#13;
evaluation (methodologies and selection criteria), approval, con-&#13;
tracting and supervision of projects, were reviewed during the&#13;
analysis mission in relation to the kinds of projects to be&#13;
financed with resources of the Bank, and were found generally&#13;
acceptable.   Hence in phase III mechanisms and procedures will be&#13;
used that are substantially similar to those of the preceding&#13;
phase.    These  mechanisms  and  procedures  are  contained  in  the&#13;
Operating Regulations, and their presentation constitutes a condi-&#13;
tion precedent to the first disbursement of the operation (see&#13;
Annex III-1).&#13;
3.9   International public bidding procedures will be followed when the&#13;
proceeds of the Bank's financing are used and when the estimated&#13;
amounts involved exceed US$1 million equivalent in the case of&#13;
construction and US$250,000 equivalent in the case of equipment and&#13;
materials.   This process shall be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the procedures appended to the loan contract. The above thresholds&#13;
are justified considering that, in similar projects in the country,&#13;
foreign bidders participate when amounts higher than these are&#13;
involved.   The procedure for smaller amounts will be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* 18 -&#13;
(i) amounts under US$50,000:   force account;  (ii) amounts under&#13;
US$150,000:   limited competition with at least three bidders; and&#13;
(iii) amounts over US$150,000 but under US$1 million:   national&#13;
public bidding.&#13;
3.10  The criteria for selection of the different types of projects have&#13;
been  revised  (see  Operating  Regulations  in Annex III-1).    The&#13;
adjustments were made to reflect fluctuations in costs and include&#13;
modifications complementary to the designs of types of projects&#13;
(for example, the inclusion of house connections in water&#13;
projects).&#13;
3.11  For  the present  operation  the procedures  for contracts  for  the&#13;
execution of works, delivery of supplies, presentation of guaran-&#13;
tees, disbursements, and approval of projects will be those used in&#13;
the preceding stages.&#13;
3.12  The analysis  mission analyzed the  indicators being used by the&#13;
program to measure its progress and efficiency.   These indicators&#13;
have been adjusted for the FISE-IDB program and it has been agreed&#13;
that they will be used to monitor progress in the proposed opera-&#13;
tion. Also, monitoring indicators will be included to measure the&#13;
program's accomplishment of its purposes.   These  indicators are&#13;
presented in Annex III-2.&#13;
3.13  Institutional strengthening component.  In the present operation it&#13;
is proposed that some of the design problems of the component for&#13;
FISE institutional strengthening under loan 729/OC be corrected.&#13;
This would be done by setting up a fund for new types of projects&#13;
in accordance with paragraph 2.5(d).   It would not be possible to&#13;
disburse resources from this fund until the consultancies called&#13;
for under loan 729/OC had been contracted for and were in execu-&#13;
tion. In addition, to decentralize promotion, control and monitor-&#13;
ing activities in the RAA, a coordinating unit will be set up for&#13;
the projects to be executed in the two subregions of the RAA.  It&#13;
is recommended that FISE be required to present to the Bank the&#13;
operational scheme for decentralization of these activities within&#13;
six months after the effective date of the contract.&#13;
3.14  Maintenance fund component.   The implementation of this fund will&#13;
be designed with institutional strengthening resources of loan&#13;
729/OC. The arrangement for transfer of the resources will comply&#13;
with the article on maintenance and supervision in the interinsti-&#13;
tutional coordination agreement concluded between FISE, MED and&#13;
MINSA (see paragraph 3.6). This agreement will be signed in coor-&#13;
dination with the Ministry of Finance. It is recommended that FISE&#13;
be required to present to the Bank both the design and the terms&#13;
for the transfer of resources within three months after the&#13;
effective date of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3.15  Execution timetable.   It is proposed that the resources for the&#13;
program be disbursed within a period of three years following the&#13;
effective date of the prospective loan contract.   The following&#13;
tentative timetable is envisaged:   40% in the first year,  35% in&#13;
the second year, and 25% in the third.&#13;
3.16  Inspection and supervision.   This activity will be the responsi-&#13;
bility of the Country Office, which will carry it out using the&#13;
progress and parallel monitoring indicators. The sector specialist&#13;
will have the collaboration and support of the project team, as&#13;
indicated in Annex III-3, which states the time for which the human&#13;
resources will be required.&#13;
.3.17  Reports and financial statements.   These will be subject to the&#13;
Bank's general standards.&#13;
3.18  Monitoring.   This operation includes a monitoring system for the&#13;
systematic monitoring of projects, to be financed with resources of&#13;
the nonreimbursable parallel technical-cooperation operation.   It&#13;
will permit the continual measurement of accomplishment of the&#13;
purposes and attainment of the goals of the program and at the same&#13;
time generate feedback to the ex ante evaluation systems.&#13;
3.19  The preliminary basic list of monitoring indicators was reviewed as&#13;
- part of the analysis of the operation. It is recommended that FISE&#13;
be required to present the final list of indicators to the Bank for&#13;
approval within three months following the entry into force of the&#13;
program. The program calls for monitoring at two different times:&#13;
the first would be carried out upon execution of 50% or at the end&#13;
of the first year of execution of the program, whichever comes&#13;
first, and the second at the end of the program.&#13;

IV.  PROGRAM VIABILITY AND RISKS&#13;
A.   Program viability&#13;
4.1   The viability of the program is based on the experience acquired by&#13;
FISE during the two previous stages, in which demand for projects&#13;
to meet basic unmet needs in the priority sectors of health and&#13;
education has been served to a degree greater than anticipated.&#13;
FISE's execution capacity in dealing with this demand has been&#13;
satisfactory, as indicated in paragraphs 1.24 and 1.25.&#13;
4.2   The larger amount of resources to be allocated during this stage is&#13;
warranted in view of the institutional strengthening to be provided&#13;
for FISE as indicated in paragraph 2.10, based on the pipeline of&#13;
projects evaluated but lacking financing, which totals US$55 mil-&#13;
lion, and the promotion of new projects.&#13;
4.3   FISE has attained success as an institution and is recognized by&#13;
the government as a vehicle for attending to short-term social&#13;
needs which has earned a high degree of acceptance from public&#13;
organizations  and  the community.    It has also  achieved a high&#13;
degree  of  coordination  with  line  ministries,  as  indicated  in&#13;
paragraph 1.36.&#13;
B.   Risks&#13;
4.4   The fiscal austerity and lack of operating efficiency at the public&#13;
agencies heightens the risk that facilities to be financed by FISE&#13;
will deteriorate for lack of preventive maintenance of their infra-&#13;
structure.   This risk would be reduced by establishment of the&#13;
maintenance fund and complementary community participation projects&#13;
to educate and train local committees to take charge of maintenance&#13;
of the physical investments.&#13;
4.5   The institutional capacity of FISE to diversify, within the social&#13;
priorities, the menu of types of complementary projects that meet&#13;
unsatisfied basic needs of the population imposes a constraint on&#13;
accomplishment of the basic purposes of the program.   This risk&#13;
would be mitigated by institutional strengthening to expedite the&#13;
use of resources allocated to studies for the validation and&#13;
simplification of evaluation methodologies and the targeting of&#13;
resources.&#13;
4.6   The proximity of the elections could entail a risk for the alloca-&#13;
tion of resources in accordance with social priorities. This risk&#13;
could be reduced by application of the targeting scheme adopted by&#13;
FISE, the proposed timetable for disbursement of the resources, and&#13;
the pipeline of evaluated projects for which no financing is&#13;
available.&#13;

NICARAGUA&#13;
NONREIMBURSABLE TECHNICAL-COOPERATION OPERATION TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE&#13;
ROLE OF FISE AND ESTABLISH A PROJECT MONITORING SYSTEM&#13;
(TC-94-09-34-4)&#13;
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
REQUESTOR:            The Republic of Nicaragua&#13;
AMOUNT:               IDB:  US$300,000 (FSO), nonreimbursable&#13;
EXECUTING             The Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE)&#13;
AGENCY:&#13;
BENEFICIARY:          FISE&#13;
OBJECTIVES:           To collaborate with the Government of Nicaragua in&#13;
(a) defining the future role of FISE, and (b) sup-&#13;
porting a system for the periodic monitoring of&#13;
projects.&#13;
BENEFITS:             This technical-cooperation operation would support&#13;
the Government of Nicaragua in ensuring that FISE&#13;
ties into the social strategy as part of the public&#13;
sector reform program.   In addition,  the project&#13;
monitoring system would provide FISE with basic&#13;
information with  which  to  determine  the  socio-&#13;
economic impact of projects financed by it.&#13;
TERMS:                Execution:  three years for the studies.  The study&#13;
and activities to define the role of FISE are to be&#13;
done in the first 18 months. The last disbursement&#13;
would be made six months after expiration of the&#13;
term of execution.&#13;

I. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTANCY&#13;
1.1   Based on the government's public sector reform program and economic&#13;
and social development plan, the purposes of the consultancy would&#13;
be (a) to determine whether FISE should be terminated or continued&#13;
after 1997 based on (i) the support it is giving to the social&#13;
strategy in its coordination with the line ministries, (ii) its&#13;
efficiency as an executing agency for small-scale infrastructural&#13;
works, and (iii) an analysis of the results and impact of its&#13;
projects and an evaluation of its functions, products, procedures,&#13;
systems for services to the population, beneficiary targeting and&#13;
selection criteria, and its project selection criteria and other&#13;
project management mechanisms; (b) in the event that it is decided&#13;
not to keep FISE in operation, to consider which mechanism to use&#13;
to transfer its functions and experience; (c) if it is decided to&#13;
keep FISE in operation, to consider different options for its&#13;
institutional redefinition and duration and to select the organiza-&#13;
tional, legal and financial structure that is most viable and&#13;
likely to accomplish the purposes of the social policy and the&#13;
public  sector  reform program.   Also,  to determine  the menu of&#13;
projects for the future FISE and the criteria for project eligibil-&#13;
ity, evaluation, supervision and monitoring.&#13;
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#13;
The specific objectives of this consultancy are spelled out in&#13;
section II of the plan of operations in the project technical&#13;
files.&#13;
II. TIMETABLE OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The consultancy for FISE will be carried out in three principal&#13;
phases:&#13;
Phase I.   Diagnosis  (in the first three months).   Comprises the&#13;
analysis, evaluation and preparation of the different options for&#13;
the institutional definition of FISE, and includes the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
2.1   Commencement of the work of a senior consultant to carry out the&#13;
activities specified in the terms of reference.   A working team&#13;
must be assembled consisting of a representative of the Ministry of&#13;
Social Action and representatives of FISE and the Ministries of&#13;
Finance, Education, Health and INAA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 11-1&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
2.2   Preparation  of  the  activities 'timetable,  a schedule,  and  final&#13;
terms of reference for the consultants and the consolidated work&#13;
plan for each consultant (see appended plan of operations and&#13;
project technical file).&#13;
Phase II.   A national seminar/workshop (in the first six months).&#13;
The tentative schedule of the two-day seminar for discussion and&#13;
coordination  at  the  technical  level  of  the  different  options&#13;
devised by the consultant and the counterpart team.   It is hoped&#13;
that this seminar/workshop will be attended by senior technicians&#13;
from FISE and the Ministries of Finance, Education, Health, MAS,&#13;
and other sector governing institutions associated with the opera-&#13;
tions of FISE.   Participation by NGOs and the private sector, and&#13;
by international agencies concerned with FISE's field of action and&#13;
related areas,  will also be of utmost  importance.   It would be&#13;
useful to have a brief introduction to open the seminar/workshop&#13;
and serve as a guide to the management in conducting it.&#13;
Phase III. Discussion and consultation at the political level (in&#13;

(B)   PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
To obtain information with which to improve all aspects of the&#13;
targeting of resources, the quality of the projects, community&#13;
participation, project sustainability, and administration of the&#13;
life  cycle  of  FISE-supported  projects,  FISE  has  undertaken  to&#13;
evaluate the results of executed projects in order to compare their&#13;
actual results with the purposes and goals set for them. The study&#13;
to be supported by this technical assistance would be the second&#13;
one to be commissioned by FISE for this purpose. It has been pro-&#13;
vided that after this study two monitoring operations will be&#13;
carried out: the first one upon execution of 50% of the program or&#13;
at the end of the first year of its execution, whichever comes&#13;
first, and the second at the end of the program.&#13;
&#13;

II. OBJECTIVES OF THE REQUESTED STUDY&#13;
The consultancy has the following objectives:&#13;
2.1   General objective&#13;
To collaborate with the board of directors of FISE in the design&#13;
and implementation of the periodic impact monitoring system in&#13;
order to determine the socioeconomic impact of FISE-financed proj-&#13;
ects in improving its targeting strategy and the servicing of its&#13;
target population, by strengthening mechanisms for more accurate&#13;
targeting of its resources, improving the quality and sustain-&#13;
ability of the investments financed, increasing the benefits&#13;
yielded by the investments, and increasing community participation&#13;
in the setting of priorities.&#13;
2.2   Specific purposes&#13;
The specific purposes are spelled out in paragraph 3.2 of the plan&#13;
of operations and project technical file.&#13;
III. SCOPE OF THE WORK&#13;
3.1   General considerations&#13;
An empirical study is to be done in rural and urban areas of Nica-&#13;
ragua where FISE-supported projects have been executed or are in&#13;
progress, using quantitative and qualitative research methods.&#13;
3.2   Prolect selection&#13;
The projects to be studied must be representative of the projects&#13;
approved by FISE.   The sample of projects to be studied can be&#13;
selected at random from the FISE program and the data in its infor-&#13;
mation system.   FISE must provide the consultant with information&#13;
on the projects already completed and in execution, by municipality&#13;
and type of project.&#13;
The projects studied must be representative of the projects&#13;
financed by FISE. Accordingly, at least 80% of them must be chosen&#13;
from among those that have been completed, and the remaining 20%&#13;
from among the projects in progress.&#13;
3.3   Target populations and baseline data&#13;
The populations to be targeted in this monitoring exercise will be&#13;
direct beneficiaries, executing agencies and contractors, community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-1&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
leaders, sector representatives in the area, and the general popu-&#13;
lation in the service area of the projects.&#13;
The areas in which information is to be compiled and the indicators&#13;
on which information could be obtained are presented in detail in&#13;
paragraphs 4.3.1 to 4.3.4 of the plan of operations and project&#13;
technical file.&#13;
3.4   Selection of monitoring indicators&#13;
To select some of the indicators to be used, the consultant will&#13;
have to become familiar with FISE's project cycle administration&#13;
procedures and ex ante evaluation methods, and review a list of&#13;
indicators for clearance by FISE and the Bank.&#13;
3.5   Sources of information&#13;
The sources of baseline information that the consultant is expected&#13;
to use are FISE's information system, interviews and surveys, and&#13;
official statistics.&#13;
IV. EXPECTED OUTPUTS&#13;
4.1   During the study&#13;
During execution of the study and before the field work begins, the&#13;
consultant must submit to FISE for approval the final designs both&#13;
for the sample of projects and municipalities and for the sample of&#13;
households for the surveys of beneficiaries.   More specifically,&#13;
the consultant must present to FISE (i) definitions of the indica-&#13;
tors to be studied, by sector and type of project; (ii) a list of&#13;
the baseline data to be compiled and survey forms to be used;&#13;
(iii) the sample design; (iv) the method for testing census forms;&#13;
(v) the methodology to be used for compiling and supervising the&#13;
collection of data and for processing and analyzing such data; and&#13;
(vi) a program of activities and a detailed execution timetable.&#13;
Once the field work has begun, the consultant is expected to&#13;
present monthly progress reports, and partial reports as well if&#13;
the agreed execution timetable calls for them.&#13;
4.2   Final report&#13;
Upon completion of the work, the consultant will present a final&#13;
report containing at least what is called for in paragraph 5.2 of&#13;
the plan of operations and project technical file.&#13;
&#13;

REQUEST:&#13;
EXECUTING              The  project  would  be  executed  by  the  Instituto&#13;
AGENCY:                Nacional   de   Estadisticas   y   Censos   [National&#13;
Institute of Statistics and Census] (INEC) attached&#13;
to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Develop-&#13;
ment.&#13;
BENEFICIARY:          The Republic of Nicaragua.&#13;
OBJECTIVES:            To collaborate with the Government of Nicaragua in&#13;
its preparation of the population and housing cen-&#13;
sus and of an agricultural module at the national&#13;
level, which will include the following activities:&#13;
(i) updating of national maps; (ii) preparation of&#13;
the methodology for the enumeration stage and the&#13;
post-census stage; (iii) the enumeration, and&#13;
(iv) computer processing and publication in the&#13;
mass media of census findings.&#13;
BENEFITS:              The  technical-cooperation operation would comple-&#13;
ment the efforts the Government of Nicaragua has&#13;

Nicaragua as well as data on their housing and&#13;
farms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
This information will directly complement FISE's&#13;
operations in that its results will help target&#13;
FISE's efforts in the country by providing it with&#13;
detailed information on the social and economic&#13;
characteristics of the housing situation in each&#13;
city, neighborhood and large or small rural settle-&#13;
ment in respect of people living in poverty, their&#13;
schooling, health status, etc.&#13;
In addition to the government, private enterprise,&#13;
international agencies, national research centers&#13;
and the population at large will benefit from cen-&#13;
sus data in the pursuit of their various economic&#13;
activities in the country.&#13;
It is important to have access to current and&#13;
reliable  agricultural  information,  for  the  last&#13;
agricultural census was taken in 1971, and its data&#13;
were lost in the earthquake of 1977. Agricultural&#13;
information is also important for the country's&#13;
programming in the sector and for the programs&#13;
financed by the Bank.&#13;
TERMS                  For execution of the project:   24 months;  for the&#13;
last disbursement:    30 months,  both running from&#13;
the date of the technical-cooperation agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   In 1982,  the Government of Nicaragua,  acting through INEC with&#13;
technical and financial assistance from the United Nations Popula-&#13;
tion Fund (UNFPA), began preparations for a census, but had to&#13;
suspend them because of domestic instability.   All these efforts&#13;
lost their current relevance and had to be started all over again&#13;
as part of the preparations for the present census.&#13;
1.2   In 1985, the government decided to conduct the Nicaraguan Socio-&#13;
demographic Survey (ESDENIC '85), which was carried out almost&#13;
completely and yielded a limited range of information that was&#13;
urgently  required  for national  planning  purposes.    In 1989,  a&#13;
survey of the current situation was carried out for the city of&#13;
Managua; in 1992, the UNDP began giving support to preparation of&#13;
the  first  document  of  the  census  project,  and  the  National&#13;
Standard-of-Living Measurement Survey was held in early 1993.&#13;
1.3   In  1993,  UNFPA  provided  the  resources  to  set  up  an  internal&#13;
technical  committee,  which  began  a  series  of  activities  in&#13;
preparation for the census, including an experimental census in&#13;
Diriomo municipality.&#13;
1.4   The  proposed  technical-cooperation  operation,  the  purposes  and&#13;
scope of which are described below, will supply the Government of&#13;
Nicaragua, private enterprise, the international agencies, the&#13;
national research centers, and the general public, with up-to-date&#13;
demographic and socioeconomic information on the population of&#13;
Nicaragua and data on their housing and farms.&#13;
1.5   The  census  will  directly  complement  FISE's  operations  in  the&#13;
country in that its results will help target those operations by&#13;
providing detailed data on the situation of groups living in&#13;
poverty in each city, neighborhood, and large and small rural&#13;
settlements, and on their schooling and health status.&#13;
1.6   The  country's  economy  is based  on  agricultural  production  for&#13;
domestic consumption and foreign trade, which generate the leading&#13;
export goods, the most important being coffee, cotton, bananas and&#13;
beef.   These  four commodities account for 70% of the country's&#13;
total exports and pay for 26% of its total imports.&#13;
1.7   On the agricultural sector, including the agrarian reform, informa-&#13;
tion is available only from administrative sources.   There are no&#13;
details on specific structural aspects of the farms.   There is,&#13;
however, information from a variety of sources, deriving from a&#13;
variety of methods of making annual estimates of the production of&#13;
the  leading  crops  and  livestock  species  for  purposes  of  the&#13;
national accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
1.8   INEC is the institution responsible for the country's statistical&#13;
and socioeconomic information. It presents certain weaknesses, and&#13;
corrective measures are planned for the medium term, for which&#13;
technical-cooperation funding will be requested from the Bank.&#13;
However, given the need for the census as a planning and program-&#13;
ming instrument, in the short term and through the proposed proj-&#13;
ect, SPTF funds are being requested to implement it.&#13;
II. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS&#13;
2.1   The objective of the technical-cooperation operation is to collabo-&#13;
rate with the Government of Nicaragua in completing the prepara-&#13;
tions for the population and housing census and the construction of&#13;
a national agricultural module.   This work includes the following&#13;
activities: (i) updating of the national maps; (ii) preparation of&#13;
the methodology for the enumeration and post-census stages; (iii) the&#13;
enumeration, and (iv) the computerized processing of the census&#13;
results and their publication in the mass media.&#13;
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1   To accomplish the purposes and complement the efforts being made in&#13;
preparation for the national population and housing census, includ-&#13;
ing the agricultural module, this technical-cooperation operation&#13;
will help conduct the following activities in three principal stages:&#13;
1. Preparatory stage&#13;
3.2   The preparatory stage consists in updating cartography, drawing up&#13;
work plans, preparation of census materials (enumeration forms,&#13;
training manuals for census takers, critical manuals, coding,&#13;
processing, control procedures), the conduct of an experimental&#13;
census, and a campaign to disseminate the census findings.&#13;
3.3   This stage is almost complete.  A complementary updating of carto-&#13;
graphy covering urban populations remains to be done to have more&#13;
current maps available at the time of the census, as well as print-&#13;
ing the enumeration forms and manuals to be used in the census&#13;
survey, the financing for which will be provided by UNFPA and UNDP&#13;
(see the activity schedule on page 10).&#13;
3.4   The training plan is one of the main requirements for conducting&#13;
the  census.   The  design of manuals has  been completed  in  its&#13;
entirety, and the departmental delegates and their assistants must&#13;
now be trained. Up to US$100,000 from the Bank's financing will be&#13;
used to train the delegates and the rest of the requisite census&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
personnel, including the payment-of travel allowances to attend the&#13;
training courses.   These items would be partially financed with&#13;
funds from UNFPA.&#13;
2. Census stage (enumeration)&#13;
3.5   The supervisors and enumerators will first be selected and trained&#13;
and the census materials will be distributed. The enumeration will&#13;
then be carried out throughout the country.   This will take rela-&#13;
tively little time, and as soon as it is done preliminary results&#13;
will be obtained by a manual tally.   This stage will require the&#13;
active participation of a variety of public and private institu-&#13;
tions, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society.&#13;
3.6   Planning the census system and structure is viewed as the activity&#13;
of greatest complexity and magnitude in the entire project because&#13;
of its cost and the number of persons who will be employed in&#13;
gathering the information of the national census, and this activity&#13;
will require appropriate financing and a structure that can carry&#13;
it out well.&#13;
3.7   The  system was designed and tested in the Diriomo experimental&#13;
census,  carried out in 1993.   Under the system developed,  each&#13;
department and municipality will have its own census committee,&#13;
which will secure full support from the institutions represented on&#13;
the committee and from the population of each municipality.&#13;
3.8   Up to US$2,112,850 will be allocated from resources of the Bank for&#13;
this stage, and will be used primarily to hire all the personnel&#13;
required for the census.  The program will have US$585,000 in Bank&#13;
resources to purchase the additional computers and training equip-&#13;
ment, including vehicles and office materials.&#13;
3.9   The enumeration will be carried out by 14,699 persons distributed&#13;
among all nine regions of the country, including departmental dele-&#13;
gates and their assistants, municipal delegates and their assistants,&#13;
urban and rural area chiefs and their assistants, supervisors, and&#13;
enumerators.   This personnel will be given training in the activ-&#13;
ities involved in preparing for the census.&#13;
3.10 The enumeration will include an agricultural module, which will be&#13;
incorporated into the census by means of a page of the census form&#13;
for taking down information on land holdings in rural areas and on&#13;
their owners, the characteristics of the farm, the form of land&#13;
tenure, the presence of cattle and other livestock species and the&#13;
leading perennial and annual crops.&#13;
3. Post-census stage&#13;
3.11 This critical stage includes coding, inputting and processing of&#13;
the data collected in the enumeration, and its tabulation for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 6 of 11&#13;
analysis, publication and distribution to all those who need the&#13;
information for use in studies and plans for national decision-&#13;
making.&#13;
3.12  About  US$600,000  will  be  provided  for  this  stage  to  cover  all&#13;
consultancies, microcomputers, software, maintenance and contingen-&#13;
cies using funds from the Bank, UNDP, and UNFPA.&#13;
IV. BUDGET&#13;
4.1    The  total  cost  of  the  project  would  come  to  the  equivalent  of&#13;
US$8.10 million, of which US$3.30 million would be the Bank's&#13;
contribution, made in local currency from the Social Progress Trust&#13;
Fund  (SPTF)  on  a  nonreimbursable  basis.    The  government  would&#13;
contribute the equivalent of US$3.03 million, UNFPA US$1.50 mil-&#13;
lion,  and UNDP US$0.27 million.   This budget  is summed up  in the&#13;
following table:&#13;

V. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1    The lack of census information on population and housing in Nicara-&#13;
gua over the last 20 years and on agriculture over the last 30, has&#13;
made it difficult to take policy decisions in government and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
private sphere, which has prompted these sectors to make their own&#13;
enumerations for purposes of both economic and social investments.&#13;
5.2   These isolated efforts to generate information have not only been&#13;
expensive, but the information generated has proved an unreliable&#13;
basis for making decisions, which has imposed severe constraints on&#13;
the design of policies, projects and measures in the economic and&#13;
social sectors.&#13;
5.3   One of the principal problems preventing INEC from carrying out a&#13;
census is a lack of equipment for data processing, the printing of&#13;
enumeration forms and materials for taking down data, and brief-&#13;
cases and insignia for the field staff.&#13;
5.4   Priority will be given to training the INEC personnel, and particu-&#13;
larly the staff who will be processing the census data.  Also, to&#13;
do the enumeration work satisfactorily, INEC will need equipment&#13;
and vehicles to distribute the enumeration forms to all localities&#13;
in the country and to enable the personnel to move about during the&#13;
preparatory work and the enumeration itself.&#13;
5.5   There  is  important  agricultural  information  that  must  be  made&#13;
available without waiting for the next census to provide it, which&#13;
would not otherwise be possible until the end of the century. The&#13;
last agricultural census was carried out in 1971, but all the&#13;
information it produced was lost in the earthquake of 1977. Hence&#13;
the data being worked with are those of 1963.   This agricultural&#13;
information is important for the programs being financed by the&#13;
Bank  in  the  sector,  such  as  FOSEMAG  (921/SF  and  801/OC-NI),&#13;
PNDR (927/SF-NI),  and  the  national  accounts  component  of  the&#13;
technical-cooperation operation for reform of the Central Bank&#13;
(ATN/SF-3885-NI),   and  for  other   multilateral   and  bilateral&#13;
agencies.&#13;
5.6   Hence financing to carry out the activities called for in this plan&#13;
of operations is justified because if the government, through INEC,&#13;
is to undertake an operation on the magnitude of the national cen-&#13;
sus, the technical personnel that will carry out those activities&#13;
will have to be strengthened and computer equipment provided to&#13;
process the high volume of census information reliably and expedi-&#13;
tiously so that it may be available before the next elections, to&#13;
be held in 1996.&#13;

VI. EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
1.  Execution of previous stazes&#13;
6.1   For  the  execution  of  the  previous  stages  of  the  census,  INEC&#13;
assigned responsibility for census activities to the Census&#13;
Division. There are 15 full-time staff members devoted exclusively&#13;
to organizing this process, and they have received training and&#13;
assistance funded by UNFPA. 1/  The remaining staff of INEC will&#13;
also provide support during the enumeration and post-census stages.&#13;
Notwithstanding this structure, experience has been marked by slow&#13;
execution so far, but this is expected to be corrected with the&#13;
creation of the coordinating unit referred to in paragraph 6.6.&#13;
6.2   The  government  has  undertaken  major  efforts  to  organize  the&#13;
execution of the census and to establish systems for administra-&#13;
tion. PERT flow charts have been drawn up, as well as an activity&#13;
schedule, detailed budget, follow-up system, training programs,&#13;
publicity campaigns, and the presidential decree declaring the&#13;
census a matter of national interest.   The decree, which includes&#13;
provisions on internal regulations, responsibilities of the&#13;
organizations involved, the organization of the census, etc., is&#13;
awaiting presidential approval.&#13;
6.3   The Bank's technical-cooperation  funding will be used to support&#13;
INEC  in drafting  the  internal  regulations  provided  for  in  the&#13;
decree.   Support will also be provided for compliance with other&#13;
provisions to be established to ensure that execution and evalua-&#13;
tion mechanisms are compatible with the operation's objectives.&#13;
2. Execution of the proposed project&#13;
6.4   The executing agency for this technical-cooperation operation would&#13;
be the Ministry of Economic Development (MEDE) through INEC, which&#13;
would contract for UNDP services and act as administrator of all&#13;
resources  allocated  to  the  project  from  domestic  sources  and&#13;
multinational and bilateral agencies.&#13;
6.5   Enumerators and supervisors will be hired by INEC, as the executing&#13;
agency, through the Census Division. This process would take place&#13;
in accordance with the pertinent rules set forth in the agreement&#13;
to be signed by MEDE and UNDP on administration of the technical-&#13;
cooperation funding.&#13;
1/    UNFPA has vast experience in census organization,  enumeration and&#13;
ex post evaluation, which has been transmitted to INEC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX II-2&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
6.6   In order to strengthen the Census Division, project resources will&#13;
be used to create a project coordinating unit responsible for&#13;
carrying out the technical and administrative follow-up on census&#13;
activities  and  prepare  requests  for  disbursements  from  the&#13;
government's contribution to the project.   The coordinating unit&#13;
will work through a principal technical advisor, who is currently&#13;
being hired with UNFPA resources and will be required for at least&#13;
two years for the post-census stage, for whose services resources&#13;
have been provided from the Bank's contribution.   This unit will&#13;
include, in addition to the principal technical advisor, (i) an&#13;
international   expert   in  data  processing;   (ii) two  national&#13;
consultants specializing in cartography and related training;&#13;
(iii) an expert in charge of the administrative and financial&#13;
aspects of the census; and (iv) an international expert special-&#13;
izing in demographic analysis.&#13;
6.7   In addition,  to support  the executing  agency  in the  execution&#13;
activities, a National Census Commission will be established&#13;
consisting of the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of the&#13;
Interior, the Minister of Social Action, the President of the&#13;
Nicaraguan Municipal Development Institute (INIFOM), and a private-&#13;
sector representative, to ensure the requisite cooperation with and&#13;
success of the census activities.   The Commission will carry out&#13;
the following duties:   (i) promote and organize cooperation among&#13;
institutions;  (ii) promote civil support  from social  groups  and&#13;
mobilize public opinion; (iii) coordinate the process of securing&#13;
support from public and private institutions; and (iv) follow up on&#13;
the census program and establish the survey period.&#13;
6.8   An Executive Census Committee will also be set up, chaired by a&#13;
representative of MEDE and including INEC, UNFPA, UNDP, and the&#13;
principal technical advisor. The Committee will be responsible for&#13;
(i) making essential decisions in connection with obtaining and&#13;
using financial resources needed to properly carry out the national&#13;
census; (ii) setting up subcommittees as needed to attend to&#13;
specific problems; and (iii) propose to the National Census&#13;
Commission  legal  measures  deemed  necessary  to  perform  census&#13;
activities.&#13;
6.9   The  principal  activities  planned  to  follow  up  on  the  census&#13;
project, along with the time needed to carry them out, are&#13;
presented in the following table:&#13;

poverty by endeavoring to target efforts to the most depressed&#13;
areas, such as the RAA;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
(b) to intensify the search for new lines of projects to meet the&#13;
basic needs of the population;&#13;
(c) to support programs to make the projects sustainable, and&#13;
(d) to intensify participation by civil society in its own&#13;
community development undertakings and in modernization of the&#13;
State.&#13;
4.    Brief description of the program&#13;
For the accomplishment of its purposes, the program has been&#13;
provided with resources to finance three components:&#13;
A. Investments&#13;
Under this component, financing would continue to be provided for&#13;
the execution of projects in the health and education sectors,&#13;
including  equipment  and basic  sanitation.    Financing  would  be&#13;
provided for environmental protection projects as well.   Financing&#13;
would be stepped up for projects in (i) sanitation, to contribute&#13;
to reducing  the  existing  deficit;  (ii) community  promotion  and&#13;
development, to foster civil-society participation in sustaining&#13;
physical investments; and (iii) projects in other areas, to meet&#13;
the fundamental needs of the community, provided they are declared&#13;
eligible in accordance with the Operating Regulations. These areas&#13;
include the rehabilitation of markets and local slaughterhouses,&#13;
reforestation, school vegetable gardens, improved stoves to save&#13;
energy, actions in support of children, kits of school supplies,&#13;
and minilibraries.&#13;
Also, program actions would be stepped up in the RAA in new&#13;
projects in addition to those already carried out by FISE, in&#13;
support of one of the country's most depressed and remote regions,&#13;
which  are being covered  to the end of 1994 by USAID.    It is&#13;
expected that at least US$3 million will be available for use in&#13;
new types of projects, especially in the areas of access roads and&#13;
reforestation, which are basic needs for this region. Funds would&#13;
be made available for new types of projects provided their criteria&#13;
for eligibility, selection and evaluation are compatible with those&#13;
currently used by the FISE-IDB program.   It was agreed during the&#13;
analysis mission that, in the short term and by means of short-term&#13;
consulting services, support would be furnished to FISE in&#13;
reviewing new projects for the RAA through preparation of a sample&#13;
to lay the groundwork for establishing the above-mentioned&#13;
criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
In  the  execution  of  this  component,  FISE  will  carry  out  the&#13;
following stages:&#13;
(i) programming: application of criteria for targeting and&#13;
selection of types of projects;&#13;
(ii)  promotion:   guidance to applicants in project formula-&#13;
tion and on the eligibility criteria and application of&#13;
the targeting criteria;&#13;
(iii) evaluation: application of the selection methodologies&#13;
and criteria;&#13;
(iv) approval, contracting for and supervision of projects:&#13;
verification of compliance with standards and proce-&#13;
dures for the acquisition of goods and services.&#13;
Drafting of contracts and periodic supervision of the&#13;
execution of projects, and&#13;
(v)  administration:   processing of payments and disburse-&#13;
ments to executing contractors.&#13;
The resources of this component will be used in projects for:&#13;
(i) equipment repair and replacement and procurement in the&#13;
sectors of education, health, sanitation and environ-&#13;
mental protection, with the exclusion, in the education&#13;
and health sectors, of any new facilities that would&#13;
increase recurring costs for the public sector;&#13;
(ii) promotion and community development to promote partici-&#13;
pation by civil society in sustaining physical invest-&#13;
ments, and&#13;
(iii)  other  types  of  projects  as  they  are  pronounced&#13;
eligible.   These include projects for the rehabilita-&#13;
tion of markets, small local slaughterhouses, refores-&#13;
tation, school vegetable gardens, improved stoves to&#13;
save energy, measures in support of children, student&#13;
instruction kits, and minilibraries. Also includes new&#13;
projects in the RAA, especially for access routes and&#13;
reforestation.&#13;
For other projects to be eligible for financing under the program,&#13;
the executing agency must present to the Bank for approval the&#13;
specific criteria for eligibility, selection and supervision&#13;
established for them on the basis of a sample evaluated by FISE to&#13;
the Bank's satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
B. Institutional strengthening&#13;
This component includes financing for (i) a core group of manage-&#13;
ment and professional staff and other FISE inputs; (ii) workshops,&#13;
seminars and studies needed to improve internal efficiency,&#13;
(iii) decentralization of the activities for promotion, control and&#13;
monitoring in the RAA, and (iv) a fund to make possible the&#13;
consideration of other types of projects that meet basic needs of&#13;
the beneficiaries.&#13;
C. Maintenance fund&#13;
This component consists of financing for the establishment of a&#13;
maintenance fund to cover the needs for upkeep of the investments&#13;
under education and health projects during the execution period.&#13;
The resources will be transferred to the community organizations,&#13;
which will utilize them under the supervision of the line minis-&#13;
tries (MINSA and MED). The fund will be scaled down and gradually&#13;
replaced by allocations on the national budget and partial contri-&#13;
butions from the communities as they are found to have the finan-&#13;
cial capacity to take over these activities.&#13;
The  program   includes  a  nonreimbursable   parallel   technical-&#13;
cooperation operation to support the performance of studies and&#13;
organization of seminars:&#13;
(i) to define the future role of FISE and its coordination&#13;
with the sector's governing entities, and&#13;
(ii) to implement a system for the periodic parallel&#13;
monitoring of executed projects.&#13;
The parallel technical-cooperation funding would also include&#13;
reimbursable financing for the population census.&#13;
5.    Project eligibility criteria&#13;
Project formulation will be guided by -FISE on the basis of the&#13;
following general eligibility criteria:   (i) direct beneficiaries&#13;
must belong to low-income groups below the poverty threshold agreed&#13;
upon between the country and the Bank; (ii) the total cost of the&#13;
project  must not  exceed US$400,000;  (iii) the projects  must be&#13;
executed  by  private  contractors;  (iv) all  investment  costs  are&#13;
eligible (purchases of land will not be financed) as are, in excep-&#13;
tional cases, the associated costs of some community promotion&#13;
projects; (v) the operation and maintenance of the projects and the&#13;
execution  capacity  of  their  administrators  must  be  guaranteed;&#13;
(vi) the ownership of lands and structures in which a given project&#13;
is being financed must be duly cleared; (vii) the projects must not&#13;
generate negative impact on the environment; and (viii) they must&#13;
generate no increases in the recurring costs of the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
These criteria must be met in all cases regardless of the type of&#13;
project.&#13;
6.    Preselection and prioritization&#13;
To preselect eligible projects and prioritize their transfer from&#13;
the Promotion Directorate to the Evaluation Directorate, a project&#13;
coding system has been devised which defines each type of project&#13;
and its priority, its geographical location (priority is assigned&#13;
on the basis of the observed regional distribution of resources),&#13;
and whether the project is urban or rural in nature.   This coding&#13;
system is built into the information network, which allows projects&#13;
to be preselected for evaluation expeditiously and, most particu-&#13;
larly, in keeping with the applicable targeting purposes.&#13;
7.    Selection criteria&#13;
For all types of projects FISE determines the demand, the size, the&#13;
guarantee of operation, and compliance with the standards of the&#13;
sector.   In all cases, the alternative chosen must be the least-&#13;
cost  solution.    The  cost  ceilings  for  the  prototype  projects&#13;
described further on would be taken as standards and be revised&#13;
regularly by FISE on the basis of the updated cost system.   FISE&#13;
must not automatically reject projects that exceed these ceilings.&#13;
When they do so, the case must be examined to determine the feasi-&#13;
bility of the project and accept or reject it.  The criteria that&#13;
govern this operation are as follows:&#13;
a. Health posts&#13;
Utilization:   (i) dispensary:   at least 4,160 visits per year for&#13;
rural areas, and 6,240 for urban areas, and (ii) medical posts: at&#13;
least 2,000 annual consultations a year for rural areas, and 4,160&#13;
for urban areas.   Construction cost:   Pacific zone:   up to US$287&#13;
per  square  meter,  US$7,000  per  medical  post  and  US$3.00  per&#13;
service/year, including consultations plus dispensary visits and&#13;
excluding activities away from the post.   Atlantic zone:   up to&#13;
US$350  per  square  meter,  US$8,500 per medical post.    Equipment&#13;
cost: up to US$1,500 for furniture and US$4,500 for equipment.&#13;
b. Schools&#13;
Utilization: at least 19 students per classroom in the peak shift&#13;
in one-room multigrade rural schools, and 30 students per classroom&#13;
in all other schools.&#13;
Construction cost:   (i) primary school:   up to US$200 per square&#13;
meter, US$12,500 per classroom, and US$415 per student in the&#13;
Pacific zone, and up to US$250 per square meter, US$15,500 per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
classroom and US$520 per student in the Atlantic zone.   (ii) Sec-&#13;
ondary school: up to US$200 per square meter, US$14,800 per class-&#13;
room, and US$500 per student in the Pacific zone, and US$250 per&#13;
square meter, US$18,000 classroom and US$600 per student in the&#13;
Atlantic zone.&#13;
The foregoing costs per student are calculated on the basis of&#13;
peak-shift enrollment.&#13;
Cost of equipment: (i) Primary school: up to 40 desks per class-&#13;
room or desks for the number of students in the peak shift at US$25&#13;
per desk, and up to US$220 per classroom for other equipment;&#13;
(ii) Secondary school:   up to 40 desks per classroom or desks for&#13;
the number of students in the peak shift at US$25 per desk. and up&#13;
to US$400 per classroom for other equipment.&#13;
c. Basic sanitation&#13;
Construction cost:   up to US$120/person in drinking water supply&#13;
projects for clustered rural populations and US$180/person when the&#13;
population  is  scattered.    In  sanitary  sewer  projects,  up  to&#13;
US$120/person.   Water supply and sewerage projects include house&#13;
connections.   In latrine projects,  up to US$100 per latrine and&#13;
US$200 per shed. In all cases it must be established that training&#13;
is a prerequisite for the eligibility of latrine projects.&#13;
An initial amount of US$1 million could be allocated from the&#13;
resources  of  the  program  for  latrines.    This  amount  could  be&#13;
increased if it were shown that 80% of the latrines built with&#13;
those resources were in use.   The proportion of latrines in use&#13;
would be based on the evaluation of representative samples of&#13;
executed projects. This level of utilization would be measured by&#13;
a parallel monitoring system to be financed under the program.&#13;
FISE will take appropriate measures acceptable to the Bank so that&#13;
the rates for drinking water services of the specific systems&#13;
funded from the loan generate enough income to cover at least all&#13;
the operating and maintenance costs of the given system. In cases&#13;
of water supply systems for scattered rural pupulations, family&#13;
rates will be charged to cover operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
Contributions of labor and materials will be accepted as part&#13;
payment to cover costs.&#13;
d.  Community  promotion   for  maintenance  of   the   investments&#13;
(committees for schools, health facilities and water supply&#13;
systems)&#13;
Training cost:  up to US$2,500/maintenance committee.   Consists of&#13;
four  modules  of  two  four-hour  workshops.    The  modules  are  on&#13;
organization, administration, maintenance, and the environment. On&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
the basis of a baseline diagnosis, the organizational situation of&#13;
the community is identified in order to determine the level of&#13;
training needed and the modules required, and the need for training&#13;
in each project is classified as low, medium or high.&#13;
e. Training in basic preventive health&#13;
Training  cost:    up  to US$45.00/beneficiary.    Consists  of  four&#13;
modules of two four-hour workshops, on health, the environment,&#13;
prevention of the most frequent diseases in the area, and a fourth&#13;
optional module depending on the community's needs.&#13;
f. Special conditions&#13;
For health and education infrastructure projects the above ceilings&#13;
exclude external works, which, in projects that have them, must not&#13;
exceed 20% of the total investment in civil works. For purposes of&#13;
the program, not more than 5% of the total cost of infrastructure&#13;
projects may be formulation and design costs and not more than 5%&#13;
supervision costs.&#13;
If an applicant lacks the technical capacity to formulate its&#13;
project,  FISE may  finance,  with  resources  of  the  program,  the&#13;
preparation of the project by private contractors.&#13;
8.    Approval&#13;
The Administrative Council is the authority in FISE responsible for&#13;
approving evaluated projects, for which purpose it holds weekly&#13;
meetings.&#13;
9.    Award of works and procurement of goods and services&#13;
The applicant entities are responsible for selecting, qualifying,&#13;
and awarding contracts to third parties for procurement and project&#13;
execution. FISE will establish the requisite procedures and mecha-&#13;
nisms for such awards, impose a ceiling of US$50,000 on directly&#13;
awarded contracts, and require price competitions for amounts under&#13;
US$150,000, and local public bidding operations for amounts above&#13;
US$150,000 and below US$400,000.  As prescribed in the Contracting&#13;
Manual, FISE will determine the qualifications to be presented and&#13;
the minimum guarantees to be provided by executing agents based on&#13;
the type of project  involved.   FISE has  the right  to veto any&#13;
contractor proposed for the execution of works, performance of&#13;
services or delivery of supplies if such action is justified on&#13;
technical grounds.&#13;
10.   Contracts for the execution of works and delivery of supplies&#13;
For the execution of works and delivery of supplies FISE has drawn&#13;
up standard contracts the parties to which are (i) FISE as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX IIl-l&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
financing agency,  (ii) the applicant  as sponsor of the projecc.&#13;
contracting party for the executing agency, and responsible for&#13;
supervision,  and  (iii) the executing agent or contractor as the&#13;
recipient of FISE's funds and responsible for proper execution of&#13;
the project.&#13;
11.   Bidding operations&#13;
When goods and services to be purchased or contracted for under the&#13;
program, including those relating to transportation and insurance,&#13;
are financed entirely or in part with foreign exchange of the&#13;
financing, the procedures and specific conditions of the bidding&#13;
operations or other contracting arrangements must be such as to&#13;
permit free competition by suppliers of goods and services of&#13;
member countries of the Bank. In consequence, in those procedures&#13;
and conditions for specific bidding operations and competitions, no&#13;
conditions shall be established which prevent or restrict the offer&#13;
of goods or competition by contractors from those countries.&#13;
12.   Monitoring of projects&#13;
FISE will use a basic list of project-monitoring indicators to&#13;
determine the attainment of physical targets, the demand for and&#13;
utilization  of  projects,  their  sustainability,  targeting,  and&#13;
environmental impact, and the characteristics of their benefici-&#13;
aries. The monitoring will be done when 50% of the projects have&#13;
been executed or at the end of the first year of execution of the&#13;
program, whichever comes first. The reports on the results of the&#13;
monitoring of the sample of projects will be presented to the&#13;
Administrative Council.&#13;
13.   Environmental impact&#13;
Environmental criteria are on hand for all the types of projects&#13;
eligible  for  financing  from the  Bank's  resources.    FISE  is  to&#13;
ensure that, for new types of projects to be financed, environ-&#13;
mental  criteria  are specified and actions  to mitigate potential&#13;
environmental  impact  and  the  cost  thereof  are  included  in  the&#13;
project formulation, design and budget process. Contracts for the&#13;
execution of works are also to include mitigating actions for&#13;
projects.&#13;
14.   Women's participation&#13;
In investment works for small social projects, the impact on women&#13;
is considerable. It must be ensured that women participate in all&#13;
types of projects eligible for financing by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III-1&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
15.   Procedure for selection and hiring of consultants&#13;
In the selection and hiring of consultancies financed entirely or&#13;
in part with resources of the Financing, (a) the procedures agreed&#13;
upon with the Bank must be followed, and (b) no provisions or&#13;
stipulations may be established which restrict or prevent&#13;
participation by consultants from the Bank's member countries.&#13;
In regard to consulting services financed with resources of the&#13;
local  counterpart  contribution,  the  Bank reserves  the  right  to&#13;
review and approve the consulting firms and individual consultants&#13;
selected, the terms of reference and the agreed fees before the&#13;
borrower, acting through the executing agency, hires them.&#13;
As for the selection and hiring of professional and management&#13;
personnel, the borrower, through the executing agency, undertakes&#13;
to consult with the Bank in advance on the appointment of FISE&#13;
directors and on any change other than that already agreed, in&#13;
FISE's organizational chart.&#13;
16.   Final provisions&#13;
The present Regulations may be amended by agreement in writing&#13;
between FISE and the IDB.   All provisions  of these Regulations&#13;
shall be subject to the provisions of the loan contract entered&#13;
into between the Bank and the Republic of Nicaragua on (date); the&#13;
provisions of the loan contract shall prevail.&#13;

            The Second Social Investment Fund
            Project will help the Government sustain its poverty
            alleviation efforts and maintain social cohesion during the
            economic adjustment period.  Additionally, the project will
            help support the Government's decentralization
            strategy, strengthen the local contracting industry, broaden
            the menu of projects that the Energy Social Investment Fund
            finances, support the targeting of resources to more
            depressed areas, and help meet the special needs of the
            indigenous population. The project will have the following
            four components: (i) investment subprojects; (ii)
            institutional strengthening; (iii) a Living Standards
            Measurement Survey; and (iv) a maintenance fund.
