                 I.                BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.      The Conflict, the Transition, andthe Emergency&#13;
&#13;
1.      Afghanistan i s one o f the poorest and longest sufferingcountries among members of the&#13;
World Bank, ravaged by chronic conflict and political instability. An estimated 4 to 7 million&#13;
people remain vulnerable to hunger with a large number dependent on inflows o f food and&#13;
humanitarian aid.     Afghanistan's infrastructure has been destroyed or degraded; its human&#13;
resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded.             Despite resilient public&#13;
administration structures, the majority o f state institutions are unable to function effectively, and&#13;
the economy and society have become fragmented.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The aftermath of September 11, 2001 precipitated major changes in the political and&#13;
military situation in Afghanistan.    The collapse of the Taliban regime was followed by the&#13;
establishment o f the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan on December 5,&#13;
2001, in Bonn, Germany. The Bonn Agreement led to an understanding on a new structure o f&#13;
government and a process that will lead to the election of a fully representative government&#13;
within aperiodofabout 30 months.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) took over central administration on&#13;
December 22, 2001. An Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) took place in June 2002&#13;
during which a transitional administration was selected, paving the way for a new constitution&#13;
and an elected, fully representative government within 2 years. The Constitutional Loya Jirga&#13;
created the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan (IRA) inDecember 2003. The IRAhas the power to&#13;
promulgate, repeal, and amend laws andregulations by decree.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Despite being hampered by limited capacity and a difficult security situation in many&#13;
parts of the country, the IRAhas improvedthe quality o f governance and decision-makmg bothat&#13;
the center and inthe provinces. It has gained widespread internationalrecognition. The IRA has&#13;
put forward a compellingvision and strategy for nationalreconstruction embodied inits National&#13;
Development Framework (NDF, April 2002).&#13;
&#13;
5.       IRA is currently coping with a range of challenges inthe urban sector, the most salient&#13;
being rapid urban growth owing to high natural population increase and influx o f retuming&#13;
refugees and displaced people. The country's total population o f 22 million i s growing at an&#13;
overall growth rate o f close to 2.8 per cent per year. Urban growth i s probably double this figure,&#13;
causing the urbanization rate to increase beyond its current level o f 23 per cent. Associated&#13;
shortagesof services abound. The urbanchallenge i s all the more daunting as a result o f pressing&#13;
land andhousing needs causedby a combination o fyears ofturmoil, a deterioratedhousing stock,&#13;
and arigidmasterplanning system.&#13;
&#13;
6.       IRA'Sstrategy for responding to the challenge is embodied inthe National Development&#13;
Framework(NDF). UrbanManagement representsone o f the Twelve NationalPrograms included&#13;
in the current budget process. The goal of the Urban Management Program is `to invest in a&#13;
balanced urban development program across the country to create viable cities that are hubs of&#13;
economic activity, and organically linked to rural areas. The Program also seeks to `develop&#13;
urban areas in a balanced manner through housing and infrastructure investments, thereby&#13;
reducing overcrowding, improving access to basic services and generating employment and&#13;
economic growth'. (Afghanistan, Rebuilding Our Nation. March 2003).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.       Urban Sector Issues&#13;
&#13;
7.       The major issues facing IRA inthe urban sector include urban population displacement,&#13;
deficiencies inservices, lack of urban land and housing, and weak urban management as outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Urban Population Displacement. Two decades o f civil strife, and political conflicts have&#13;
resulted inthe displacement o fthe populationbothinsideand outside ofthe country, creating new&#13;
socio-economic and cultural problems. The continued movement o f Internally DisplacedPeople&#13;
(DP) and returnees from neighboring countries has intensified' since the creation o f the Islamic&#13;
Republic o f Afghanistan. Repeated urban displacement of the rural population, as well as the&#13;
recent influx o f refugees and IDPs (the overwhelming majority o f which were originally from&#13;
rural areas) to cities like Kabul, Kandahar, and Mazar, i s causing considerable change to the&#13;
social fabric o f many cities. Deficiencies inurban service provision have not only contributed to&#13;
these social costs buthave limitedeconomic growth.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The choice of Afghan refugees to return to the cities of their country is frequently linked&#13;
to the benefits and interests o f urban life, particularly urban services such as water, electricity,&#13;
hospitals and schools which make a material and social difference to life. There i s also a greater&#13;
sense of security from violence and exploitation as well as morejob opportunities inurban areas.&#13;
These factors have a great influence inattracting women, especially those who have already been&#13;
exposed to better conditions o f life and urban opportunities elsewhere. The IDP and returnee&#13;
widows are the most vulnerable social group in the country and their successful integration into&#13;
urban society will be a challenge for post-conflict Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Deficiencies in Urban Services. More than two decades of war have not only devastated&#13;
Afghanistan's infrastructure but have also deprived the country o f new investment that will have&#13;
raised services above prewar levels.      As a result, most Afghans have little or no access to&#13;
conventional urban services and must either go without or rely on costly alternatives. Health&#13;
costs are among the most serious, resulting from unsafe water and sanitation and indoor air&#13;
pollution from burning traditional biomass fuels. Poor health, social instability and a reduced&#13;
ability to seek work owing to the need to managebasic household requirementsfor water and fuel&#13;
are the most serious results o f service delivery deficiencies. Diarrhea is a major cause of infant&#13;
and childmortality and i s estimated to account for 27% o f deaths inchildren between birthand 1&#13;
year and 12% of deaths of children aged 1-5. Indoor air pollution, through the use of traditional&#13;
sandalees, affects about 82% o f vulnerable households, too poor to afford other forms o f heat.&#13;
Finally, poor living conditionspromote social instability.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Other elements of urban infrastructure are also severely damaged or destroyed. About&#13;
40% of urban streets are damaged and 50% of drains are broken or do not function. Solid waste&#13;
collection i s limited to about half of all households and there are no properly managed sanitary&#13;
waste disposal sites in operation. Limited emergency efforts are on-going to address these&#13;
deficiencies. In Kabul 5,000 household connections for water supply have been provided and&#13;
pipedwater supply capacity has been doubled since June 2002. However, the programs require&#13;
scaling up within an agreedpolicy framework, including the use of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Urban Land and Housing. One of the fimdamental issues contributing to the current&#13;
urban crisis in Afghanistan i s the poor performance o f land markets. Impediments to a well&#13;
functioning land market discourage quick development and transactions of land (efficiency),&#13;
&#13;
'In Kabul alone IDPs and returnees number more than 1,200,000 (UNHCR, M a y 2004)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
deny reasonable access to all income groups (equity), militate against sustainable use&#13;
(environmental quality), and compromise the proper interaction of rules governing land markets&#13;
with other laws and regulations governing land, such as planning and taxation (compatibility).&#13;
The functioning o f land markets and the value of property rights depend on formal mechanisms&#13;
for defining and enforcing those rights, including the court system, police, the legal profession,&#13;
land surveys, record keeping systems, and titling agencies, as well as social norms and religious&#13;
customs.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The prolonged war has brought several impediments to the smooth functioning o f both&#13;
formal and informal land markets. The fact that the land administration system was ina state o f&#13;
abeyance for more than 20 years means that most transactions went unrecorded inthis period, and&#13;
even when they were recorded, there was no clear title consanguinity. In addition, many&#13;
landowners left their land unattended only to find on return that intheir absence it had been sold&#13;
many times over, and i s now occupied by someone else. Insome cases, land that was left under&#13;
the custody o f relatives or the Government is no longer available to the original owner because&#13;
another family has builta house on it. The safe haven that Kabul provided duringthe conflict also&#13;
meant that many IDPs built improvised houses on public or State land outside the limits o f the&#13;
Master Plan. These houses have grown into informal settlements that reportedly constitute over&#13;
half of the housing stock. The dispersion to peripheral mountainous areas, where land was more&#13;
readily available and affordable, was also a direct outcome of the rigid land use patterns,&#13;
inflexible development regulations and dysfunctional land and housingmarkets. The designation&#13;
o f these settlements as unauthorized developments incontravention o f the land-use dictates of the&#13;
master plan has contributed to the limited service coverage in these neighborhoods, despite the&#13;
fact that manyresidents actually pay local charges and fees.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Urban Management. Towns and cities continue to function within the limitedmandate&#13;
accorded to district municipalities under the 1964 Constitution. Centralized administrative and&#13;
fiscal mechanisms which hadbeen standardized before the war have continued inuse throughout&#13;
the country, albeit without an on-going relationship with Kabul. The introduction o f reforms&#13;
devolving aspects of service provision to the local level must be made within the context o f the&#13;
existing culture within the bureaucracy, which has long favored the support for traditional central&#13;
systems.    Despite this, municipalities lack the resources and slulls to manage the urban&#13;
environment at the level required to achieve large-scale urban reconstruction and to position&#13;
towns and cities as renewed engines o f economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Government Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 15.     Afghanistan's urbanvision i s for well hnctioningcities with inclusive, efficient, and self-&#13;
sustainingmanagement systems, operated by municipalities inclose collaborationwith residents.&#13;
Municipalities will be the principal actors for reconstructiono f the urban environment. To the&#13;
extent possible, urban services will be expanded into new and informal areas by integrating,&#13;
formal service delivery with community interventions, ensuring that all citizens can engage&#13;
effectively in city governance. Investments in private facilities, such as houses, will be the&#13;
responsibility of families and communities, while public infrastructure (urban roads, sanitation,&#13;
public parks, etc.) will be the responsibility o f municipalities and carried out through local&#13;
contractors or labor basedcontracts. Flexible urbanplanningto facilitate appropriate development&#13;
o f housing and municipal services is a priority need. Ultimately urban reconstruction and&#13;
development activities will need to take place inthe context o f strengthened capacity and greater&#13;
financial autonomy at the municipal level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16.      The delivery o furban water supplypresents particular challenges and opportunities. The&#13;
nodal agency, the Central Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS), lacks resources&#13;
to move back into its role as a central implementer o f investments. Experience from other&#13;
countries suggests that a more effective institutional model will be for decentralized service&#13;
delivery with an increased role for the private sector (building initially from the existingbase of&#13;
small-scale contractors, NGOs and UNagencies). Municipalities are likely to play a key role in&#13;
ensuring service delivery at the city level. The central government will then move into a more&#13;
facilitating role, developing appropriate policy and regulatory instruments and overseeing the&#13;
delivery of sustainable water supply and sanitation within an agreed framework o f technical,&#13;
social and environmental standards.&#13;
&#13;
17.      IRA, through the Ministryof Urban Development and Housing (MUDH),has proposed&#13;
an ambitious Urban Management Program2 (under Pillar I1 o f the National Development&#13;
Framework: Physical Reconstruction and Natural Resources) for the period ending March 20,&#13;
2004. Theproposed Government programincludes the following expected results:&#13;
&#13;
             a. Planning and Management: Strengthenedcapacity o f MLTDH; identification and&#13;
                  removal o f barriers to reconstruction (including resolution o f property disputes);&#13;
                  strategic urban plans for Kabul and other towns; and detailed local plans for&#13;
                  selectedareas.&#13;
&#13;
             b. Housing: Housing interventions include serviced land for self-help housing&#13;
                  project(s), scaled up grants program for reconstruction and upgrading,&#13;
                  introduction o f a land management policy framework that increases supply of&#13;
                  land, promotes transparency inland allocation, and moves towards bringingState&#13;
                  and privatemarket prices into line.&#13;
&#13;
             c. Infastructure:     Key infrastructure needs include increase of provision of&#13;
                  residential water supply accompanied with demand management; introductiono f&#13;
                  modem sewage treatment inKabul; provision of solid waste disposal facilities in&#13;
                  Kabul and 5 other districts; increased provision of domestic power supply; road&#13;
                  rehabilitation in Kabul and introduction of traffic management; and zoning o f&#13;
                  commercial areas.&#13;
&#13;
             d. Government Buildings: Reconstruction of government buildings, especially in&#13;
                  the provinces, and ina way that complements the civil service reformprogram.&#13;
&#13;
 18.      The proposed project contributes primarily to NDF sub-program 1: Planning and&#13;
Management and sub-program 3:Infrastructure. The project components directly support several&#13;
budget line items, as prioritized by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for fiscal year 1383&#13;
(Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
 19.      More recently, "Securing Afghanistan's Future' was presented at the BerlinConference.&#13;
The document specifically addresses urban development, focusing on urban investment priorities&#13;
and reforms3. A perusal o f the relevant extracts (below) show considerable overlap between the&#13;
suggestedprograms and the KURP.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
          a. Investment priorities:     Urban development programs will cover urban&#13;
             infrastructure, urban land and housing, and urban planning and management.&#13;
             Urban infrastructure programs include upgrading of under-serviced planned and&#13;
             unplanned areas; rehabilitation and extension of WSS services; rehabilitation and&#13;
             extension of urban roads and drains; security of tenure will"be improved through&#13;
             land titling, thereby eliminating the prospect of eviction due to illegal occupancy.&#13;
             In order to ensure smooth implementation of these programs, municipal&#13;
             management and urbanplanning will be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
          b. Implementation and reforms: Municipalities are the natural implementers of&#13;
             urban development programs, but their implementation capacity i s variable. The&#13;
             municipality of Kabul (KM)i s independent of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) but&#13;
             has a weak implementation capacity. To assist KM in the short run, a central&#13;
             Program Management Unit will need to be formed within MUDH. Initially,&#13;
             MUDHwill be responsible for implementingselectedhousingprograms, but in&#13;
             the longterm its role should be limitedmostly to coordinationandpolicy setting.&#13;

&#13;
A.      The Transitional SupportStrategy&#13;
&#13;
20.     The reconstruction strategy developed by IRA forms the framework within which the&#13;
Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) has been prepared. Developed in consultation with&#13;
the Government and other stakeholders, the TSS puts forward priorities for Bank financial and&#13;
non-financial assistance based on the areas of comparative advantage of the Bank. The Bank i s&#13;
focusing on four strategic areas; i)improving livelihoods; ii)fiscal strategy, institutions and&#13;
management; iii)governance and public administration reform; and iv) enabling private sector&#13;
development. The TSS identifies urban infrastructure as a priority to "introduce contemporary&#13;
techniques o f urban planning, initiate programs for community-based upgrading of informal&#13;
urban neighborhoods, urban land use planning and initiate modernization of the urban land&#13;
management sy~tem"~.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Inkeepingwiththe TSS, the Bank's involvement inthe UrbanManagement programis&#13;
selective. It focuses primarily on a program o f analytical services, institutional capacity building&#13;
and pilot initiatives to support municipalities inintegrating underserved residential areas, before&#13;
mainstreaming. These include:&#13;
&#13;
             a. Analytical services target key policy reformsrelated to land management and&#13;
                  housing. Policy reforms should aimat ensuringmore efficient land markets to&#13;
                  serve the needs of bothfirms and households, andprovide a greater choice of&#13;
                  affordable housingproducts.&#13;
&#13;
             b. Institutional Capacity Building. Buildingthe technical slulls andknowledgein&#13;
                  Kabul Municipality hasbegununder the IDA-financed MunicipalPublic Works&#13;
                  Program.&#13;
&#13;
             c. Pilot initiatives. The Bank`s early initiatives focus primarily on developing&#13;
                  approachesfor integratingunderserved areas into the mainstream urban setting,&#13;
                  with consequentimprovementinurbanlivelihoods. Such an approach focuses&#13;
                  not only on service improvements to currently disadvantagedneighborhoods, but&#13;
                  develop partnershipsbetween local governments indevelopingappropriate&#13;
                  institutional and financing mechanisms for regularizing informal neighborhoods.&#13;
                  Itwill also focus onintroductionofappropriate landuse, housingand service&#13;
                  delivery standardsthat are affordable to bothcommunities and local&#13;
                  governments, to ensure that service delivery to the poor i s sustainable. These&#13;
                  initiatives will operationalize the Bank's UrbanAgenda inAfghanistanby&#13;
                  improving services inunderservedneighborhoods, pilot landtenure approaches&#13;

&#13;
B.      Rationalefor World BankInvolvement inthe Urban Sector&#13;
&#13;
22.     Other than the Bank and UN-HABITAT, donor engagement in the urban sector i s small&#13;
but is slowly increasing. The European Union, GTZ, UNHCR, Japan, (through the OGATA),&#13;
MEDAIRand CARE all provide small investments, focusing mainly on housing reconstruction.&#13;
The EU i s also starting to focus on upgrading, while USAID i s supporting water supply, roads&#13;
and land management and information systems.            Italian Aid and CIDA have also provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank, Afghanistan: Transitional Support Strategy, March2003, page 23.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical assistance to MUDH- mainly inthe form of ex-patriate slulls. The Bank, through the&#13;
Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project, has focused on some urban service delivery&#13;
through a Municipal Public Works Program and emergency repairs to water supply schemes in&#13;
provincial towns. However, over all, urban reconstruction remains largely uncoordinated,&#13;
focusing on ad-hoc interventions. Policy dialogue and systematic technical assistance i s almost&#13;
entirely absent.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The Bank i s uniquely positioned to respond to opportunities and challenges by: (a)&#13;
applying a systematic and longterm approach to urbandevelopment; (b)usingthe leverage of its&#13;
lendingvolume and advisory capability to induce and accelerateinstitutional and policy reforms&#13;
and demonstrate sustainable approaches to address shelter and urban development issues; and (c)&#13;
malung use o f its extensive international experience and converting the lessons learnt into best&#13;
practices.&#13;
&#13;
C.      LessonsLearned&#13;
&#13;
24.      Capacity of local governments. Inthe past, many countries have circumvented any role&#13;
for local authorities by having central agencies implement urban upgrading without their&#13;
involvement. The lesson learned i s that, due to lack of, or weak institutional and financial&#13;
capacity, and lack of involvement and sense of ownership, local governments have not responded&#13;
effectively to the O&amp;M demands resulting from these efforts. The project has addressed this&#13;
lesson by setting up mechanisms to integrate the developed plans and infrastructure projects into&#13;
the daily functioning o f Kabul Municipality. Kabul Municipality district officers, engineers and&#13;
planners are also key actors inthe community upgrading process.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Per$ormance standards and appropriate technologies. Bank review of service provision&#13;
for the urban poor inother countries suggests that flexible design standards contribute to reduced&#13;
costs in provision andor improvement of infrastructure and, by extension, facilitate access to&#13;
housing and services. Moreover, international experience has demonstrated that upgrading is&#13;
particularly effective and affordable (low-cost) because under-served settlements are usually of&#13;
highdensity. Once security of tenure and access to infrastructure are made available, density in&#13;
many upgraded areas has continued to increase as owners expand their houses vertically, often&#13;
providing rental units for supplemental income generation. This lesson has been translated into&#13;
the project design, specifically into the menu o f alternatives which will be provided to&#13;
participatingcommunities, and inthe applicationo f special standardsto settlements improved.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Community participation and Community Fora intermediation.              Bank experience&#13;
indicates that the viability o f infrastructure improvements and sustainability o f results can be&#13;
better ensured by responding to the effective demand of beneficiaries through a participatory&#13;
process. A higher likelihood o f cost recovery has been achieved in those projects that involved&#13;
the community inthe decision making process. Projects in other counties (e.g., Guatemala and&#13;
Brazil) have also shown that NGOs and community foras can effectively intermediate between&#13;
the community and local authorities, help community members prioritize their needs and select&#13;
alternatives, and promote cost recovery. Consequently, the project applies a community-based&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
                     111.              THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
A.       Project Objective&#13;
&#13;
27.      The objective o fthe Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project i s to provide improved delivery&#13;
o fbasic urban services invulnerable communities inKabul Municipality through the upgrading&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o furbaninfrastructureand enhancing the managerial capacity o fMUDHandKabulMunicipality.&#13;
This will be achieved by supporting the integrationof selectedneighborhoods into the urban&#13;
fabric o f the capital city throughthe reconstruction andrehabilitation of urban infrastructure and&#13;
strengthening the institutional capacity o f the Ministryof Urban Development and Housing&#13;
(MUDH)andthe KabulMunicipality (KM).&#13;
&#13;
B.       ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
28.      Inpursuitoftheaboveprojectobjective, theproposedCreditwillfinancethemosturgent&#13;
reconstruction in the area under the jurisdiction of Kabul Municipality and limited technical&#13;
assistancerequirements inMUDHand will set the stage for additional future assistance from the&#13;
Bank Group and other donors in support of IRA'Snational development priorities in the urban&#13;
sector. The need for urban infrastructure i s large and the World Bank will only be able to fund a&#13;
part of the requirements. The project will lay the groundwork for a follow-up project aimed at&#13;
city-wide infrastructure reconstruction and service delivery in the Greater Kabul area and other&#13;
major urban centers.&#13;
&#13;
29.      The project will also seek co-financing for additional urgent reconstruction in the area&#13;
under the jurisdiction of Kabul Municipality and for technical assistance for MUDH and KM.&#13;
The project is structured insix parts.&#13;
&#13;
Part A: Area Upgrading in Kabul (US$25.11 million equivalent                     -   IDA financed      +&#13;
CommunityContribution)&#13;
&#13;
30.      Area upgrading' o f poor, infrastructure deficient, planned and unplanned neighborhoods&#13;
will be carried out in selected areas, following a participatory process involving the respective&#13;
community groups. The project component i s structured intwo phases to enable an early start          .In&#13;
the context o f the project a community may be a "gozar" (sub-district), a number of gozars&#13;
combined or, more likely, parts of a gozar.&#13;
&#13;
31.      The selection of communities is currently being finalized. Vulnerability and deficiency&#13;
in service delivery will be the key criteria determining site selection6. Vulnerability will be&#13;
measured by income, the ratio of income earners vs. dependents and years living in Kabul.&#13;
Deficiencies in services will be measured through access to water (piped supply, in-house well,&#13;
public well, tanker), and sanitation (none in-house, latrine to nightsoil, improvedlatrine).&#13;
&#13;
32.      A set of principles on which the upgradingprogram is to be designed are to be adopted.&#13;
These include:&#13;
&#13;
         Service levels and Standards: to be functional, designed to cost limitsbut also to consider&#13;
         life cycle costs and longer term infrastructure and utilitydevelopment plans;&#13;
         Choice and Costs: Communities to be given choice of service level and cost implications&#13;
         o f choice to be explained bothfor capital and recurrent costs;&#13;
         Balanced Programfor Impact: Balanced programs which cover most elements on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Area upgrading is defined as the improvement of basic tertiary infrastructure and services, inthis case,&#13;
water supply, sanitation, access, drainage, solid waste management and street lighting that respond to&#13;
community needs and demands and which are planned and designed inconjunction with communities and&#13;
which are constructed in comprehensive area-based packages through local contractors and community&#13;
groups, dependent on the type of work.         Upgrading also includes the appropriate replanning and&#13;
restructuringofthe physical environment&#13;
  The primary source of data will be a household survey carried out as part of the Settlement Selection&#13;
exercise usedto identifysettlements suitable for inclusion inthe project.&#13;

         Efficiency of Infrastructure Provision: Although community participation and choice i s a&#13;
         fundamental principle, the efficiency of infrastructure provision also has to be&#13;
         considered. Thus it i s important for proposals to fit with longer term plans of&#13;
         infrastructure/utility providers, particularly with regard to "network" infrastructure such&#13;
         as water supply. Infrastructure will be provided in area-based, rather than component-&#13;
         based packages to avoid future damage and disruption in the settlements. Local&#13;
         contractors will be used for "network" infrastructure and community contracting for&#13;
         "stand alone" facilities&#13;
         Supervision of Works and Transparency: Those involved in supervision and certification&#13;
         of works (i.e. consultantdNGOs) should involve community representatives to better&#13;
         ensure transparency andcommunity satisfaction;&#13;
         Community Upgrading Plans: All details agreed (e.g. provision, costs, contributions,&#13;
         operation and maintenance arrangements) to be included inCommunity Upgrading Plans&#13;
         to be prepared by communities and consultantsNGOs and agreed by all relevant&#13;
         stakeholders;&#13;
         CostRecovery and Community Contributions: Some level of contribution to capital costs&#13;
         will be madeby communities to foster a sense of ownership and for longer term financial&#13;
         discipline reasons.&#13;
         Trunk Infrastructure: This should be available at present or in the foreseeable future to&#13;
         ensure tertiary or local infrastructure provision i s able to operate effectively.&#13;
         Social Facilities: The project may provide extensions and rehabilitation to primary&#13;
         schools, hndergartens, community halls, primary health care facilities and similar&#13;
         facilities ifthese are seen to be a needand are apriority of a community.&#13;
         Minimal Resettlement: Physical proposals should apply planning and engineering&#13;
         standards flexibly to ensure sensitive, least cost proposals that minimise the need for&#13;
         clearance andresettlement.&#13;
&#13;
         Services to beprovided include:&#13;
&#13;
          Water Supply: Since the improvement o f the water supply systems in Kabul City i s&#13;
         underway with assistance from the German Govemment7, the project will focus mainly&#13;
         on providing safe hnlung water to communities inthe selectedproject neighborhoods in&#13;
         the shortest possible time. Proposals will follow longer term plans which will enable&#13;
         future individual house connections but generally serve only community standpostsinthe&#13;
         interim. Such standposts will be fitted with water meters, operated by designated&#13;
         community groups who will apply charges to those talung water and will be responsible&#13;
         for payingthe Water Authority for water consumed.&#13;
         Sanitation: A study to examine development options for the sanitation sector inKabul i s&#13;
         currently in its early stages, funded through the World Bank-financed Emergency&#13;
         Infrastructure Reconstruction Project8. However, inthe absence of a reliable and ample&#13;
         water supply, and secondary and primary sewerage and sewage treatment, sanitation will&#13;
         comprise improvedon-plot latrine arrangements.&#13;
         Solid Waste Management :The project will provide fixed brick or concrete built, or&#13;
         similar, roadside containers. It may also facilitate the implementation o f Community&#13;
         Based solid waste collection systems.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   Access Roads: Access roads will be developed to functional standards to improve all&#13;
        weather access, traffic flow and develop or maintain rights o f way and link to the road&#13;
        hierarchy for the area. Surface treatment and drainagewill take account of topography.&#13;
    0   Hill-side steps: In steep areas, the project will design and construct appropriate hill-side&#13;
        steps and provide surface water drains adjacentto these.&#13;
    0   Drainage: Stormwater drainage will be provided in communities in accordance with&#13;
        catchments and overall drainage plans for the area.&#13;
    0   Street Lighting: Where there i s an existing operational power supply in the project&#13;
        neighborhoods, the project will provide street lighting. In the absence o f an existing&#13;
        operational power supply, alternative systems will be examined, e.g., a community&#13;
        maintainedgenerator with simple distribution system for street lights.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Services and standards will be prioritised through the formulation of Community&#13;
Upgrading Plans (CUP) by Community Based Organisation (CBO) such as a Community&#13;
Development Council (CDC) or Community Action Group (CAG) with technical input from local&#13;
planning, design and contracts management consultants Following preliminary engineering and&#13;
costing the CUP will be taken back to the community for further discussion, modification and&#13;
agreement. On completion o f the consultations, the initial community proposals will be updated&#13;
by the consultants anda final CUP i s produced.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Local planning, design and contracts management (PD&amp;C) consultants in association&#13;
with CBO's will be engaged to carry out the community facilitation, planning and design and&#13;
subsequent construction supervision. Advice and assistance on procurement activities will be&#13;
provided by the Program Management Unit (PMU) formed in the MUDH supported by the&#13;
Technical Support Unit (TSU) consistingo f a consultant firm.&#13;
&#13;
36.     The 4 year project i s divided into two phases with Phase 1 covering about 40% of the&#13;
project (based on settlement area) and Phase 2 covering about 60%. Current proposals are to&#13;
upgrade tertiary infrastructure in a comprehensive manner in settlements housing approximately&#13;
250,000 people covering about 1000 hectares. O f this, US$24.19 m will be IDA financed and&#13;
US$0.92m will from community contributions.&#13;
&#13;
37.     For planning, design, procurement and construction reasons the "size" of eachphase will&#13;
benomorethan as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Phase 1-400 ha (approx. 100,000 people) inabout 20 Gozars in 2-4 Districts&#13;
    0   Phase 2 -600 ha (approx. 150,000 people) inabout 25 Gozars in2-4 Districts.&#13;
&#13;
38.     Preliminary planning and engineering suggest average costs of about US$17,500 per ha&#13;
or US$70 per capita at an average density o f 250 persons per hectare. This gives a total cost for&#13;
the Part A component o f US$17.5 million. This figure increases to approximately US$24.19&#13;
milliononce an allowance for critical connections to trunk infrastructure and extensions to critical&#13;
social infrastructure facilities are included.&#13;
&#13;
39.     Main infrastructure to be constructed under KURP (i.e. water supply distribution&#13;
networks, roads and drains) will be taken over by the responsible authorities for subsequent&#13;
operation and maintenance (e.g. CAWSS, KM).Operation and maintenance agreements will also&#13;
be set out in the Community Upgrading Plans, where community 0 &amp; M will be vital to&#13;
sustainability.&#13;

                                                                         -&#13;
&#13;
40.     This component aims to develop an appropriate methodology and capacity to regularize&#13;
urban land tenure in Kabul through pilots conducted in four communities representative of the&#13;
spectrum o f land tenure complexity in settlements identified for upgrading. Using the recently&#13;
completed maps of Kabul based on satellite imagery, the methodology will include systematic,&#13;
site-wide approachesto community mobilization, adjudication, surveyingand registration. It will&#13;
bepilotedon approximately 5,000 plots over the first two years o fKURP. Internationaland local&#13;
experts will be involved inthe design, initiation, monitoring and evaluation of the pilots and will&#13;
build capacity within the local implementing Agencies, particularly the Afghan Geodesy and&#13;
Cartography Head Office (AGCHO), the recently established special property court, and the&#13;
Kabul Makhzan (Registry) through development of manuals, the acquisition of surveying and&#13;
plotting equipment, the conduct of training in both the technical and project management&#13;
processesas well as hands-on engagement o f staff inthe implementationofthe pilots.&#13;
&#13;
41.     The outcome of the component will be viable processesand instruments for each aspect&#13;
of tenure regularization including suggested principles for adjudication which may be later&#13;
embodied into policy or law. Where the existing legal framework i s adequate for fully resolving&#13;
the disputes or rectifying the irregularities discovered during the pilots, the outcome will include&#13;
the actual regularization o f the tenure so long as the affected parties adopt the available course of&#13;
resolution and are able to complete it within the span o f the project. This initiative complements&#13;
the ongoing work supported by USAID to computerize and improve records management inthe&#13;
Kabul Makhzan, and the roll-out o f systematic titling approaches after development of an&#13;
appropriate methodology.&#13;
&#13;
42.     Thispart will be financedjointly byIDA for goods (US$0.26m) and a co-financier (US$&#13;
0.37m) for consulting services.&#13;
&#13;
Part C: Engineering and Management Support (US$4.32 million equivalent -IDA and co-&#13;
financed)&#13;
&#13;
43.      This component will provide technical assistanceto form TSUto assistthe MUDHPMU.&#13;
It will also provide for a number of PD&amp;C consultants to work at the community level. The role&#13;
of the PD&amp;C teams will be to mobilize communities, agree on services to beprovided, design the&#13;
service elements and supervise their construction.             They will also monitor technical,&#13;
environmental and safeguards compliance.&#13;
&#13;
44.      This component will be financed by IDA for all goods (US$0.45m) and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (US$ 0.lm) and by a co-financier for consultants services (US$3.77m)&#13;
&#13;
Part D: Overall CapacityBuildingfor KabulMunicipality (US$0.30 million equivalent-co&#13;
financed)&#13;
&#13;
45.      This component will support Kabul Municipality in improving its finance function,&#13;
including revenue generation, financial management, asset management, budgetingand planning.&#13;
The targeted departments include:          Investment Planning, Finance (and all related sub-&#13;
departments), Income, Properties, and the Control Office. An initial assessment of the KM&#13;
finance function will be carried out, building on existing analyses of Kabul Municipality, with&#13;
recommendations on improvement. This component will include design and implementation o f&#13;
simple computerized systemsto improveefficiency infinancial management.&#13;

Part E: Structure Plans and Preparation of Future Urban Project (US$1.64 million&#13;
equivalent co financed)&#13;
            -&#13;
&#13;
46.      This component will assist the MUDHand at least five municipalities' with preparation&#13;
of physical development plans and investment programs, building capacity in planning in the&#13;
MUDH and the municipalities, and the institutionalization of a planning process in the&#13;
municipalities. The structure plans will be produced in a participatory manner, talung into&#13;
account the development needs at the communityheighborhood, district and municipal levels.&#13;
The structure plans will provide the basis for feasibility studies of future urban investment&#13;
covering city-wide services. The feasibility studies will explore options for serviced lands,&#13;
includingcosting of alternative standards, review availability of developable land with access to&#13;
infrastructure in appropriate locations, and examine the feasibility o f scaling up, given&#13;
infrastructure, land and financing constraints. Co-financing will be sought for this component.&#13;
&#13;
Part F:Main Roads, Drainagesand Traffic ManagementinKabul (US$20.0 million&#13;
equivalent, co-financed)&#13;
&#13;
47.      Given that there are many priorities for roads and drains in Kabul Municipality, this&#13;
component takes a programmatic approach. It will commence with the selection andjustification&#13;
of investments from the various lists that have been put forward and will take account of the on-&#13;
going andproposed schemes (e.g. USAID supported roadproposals as well as the on-going Rapid&#13;
RoadRepair Project). The component consists of 6 "generic" sub-components as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         a) New Construction&#13;
         b) Reconstruction&#13;
         c) Repair and Overlay                                                       "`i&#13;

         e) SecondaryDrain Constructionand Repair&#13;
         f)Critical Traffic Management Improvements&#13;
&#13;
48.      Works under these sub-components will be designed following a justification and&#13;
prioritization exercise by Consultants worlung from a long list o f proposals put forward by the&#13;
KMandthe MUDH.&#13;

be managed by the MUDH through the Program Management Unit with the assistance of the&#13;
TSU. The Kabul Municipality will support the implementation of the component through a&#13;
Project Support Team (PST) consisting o f Kabul Municipality staff who will, in their line&#13;
function duties, contribute to the project. Community Based Organizations (CBO) in each&#13;
selected gozar will prioritize needed services, decide on a service standard package with the&#13;
assistance o f Planning, Design and Contracts Management (PD&amp;C) Consultants.&#13;
&#13;
51.     Part B: Kabul Land Tenure Regularization. The MUDHPMU, with assistance fiom&#13;
the TSU and the Land Tenure Consultants will convene a LandTenure Technical Committee of&#13;
representativeso f all stakeholder agencies as well as others with relatedexpertise. Participationin&#13;
this committee will includebutnotberestrictedto the Judicial ReformCommission, Afghanistan&#13;
Geodesy and Cartographic Head Office, Supreme Court and District Court (Makhzan), Ministry&#13;
o f Finance and the Kabul Municipality. The Land Tenure Technical Committee will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating the inputs from the respective agencies and for direction of the&#13;
consultants engagedon the component. This component will be co-financed.&#13;
&#13;
52.     Part C: Engineering and Management Support. This component includes the&#13;
technical assistance and consulting services requiredto carry out detailed design, implement and&#13;
manage the project. It will be managed by the PMU, aided by the TSU. The PMU will be&#13;
responsible for oversight o f the whole project, although the detailed design and management o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the co-financed components will also involve the co-financiers. It also includes technical&#13;
assistancefor financial audits and monitoring and evaluation. This component will be co financed&#13;
&#13;
53.     Part D: Overall Capacity Building for Kabul Municipality. This component will be&#13;
implementedby KM.The MUDHwill appoint a Financial Management Consultant to assist the&#13;
KMto carry out thiscomponent oftheproject. This component willbeco-financed.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Part E: StructurePlan and Preparationof a Future UrbanInvestmentProject. This&#13;
component will be managed by the MUDH, and the participating municipalities. The MUDH&#13;
will contract Planning Consulting F i d s to assist it in the development of the plans. The&#13;
Structure Plan Team consisting o f planners from the relevant Municipality and MUDH will,&#13;
together with the appointed Consultant, undertake the work of preparation of the Plan and the&#13;
subsequent feasibility study as part of the preparation o f the new project. m s component will be&#13;
co-financed.&#13;
&#13;
55.     Part F: Main Roads and Drainage and Traffic Management. This component is to&#13;
be co-financed. The works of different categories will be undertaken by local and international&#13;
contractors selected using Bank procurement guidelines.          The technical consultants will be&#13;
funded by co-financing (possibly ARTF). The PMU, with TSU support, will liaise with the&#13;
appointed consultants to ensure overall scope and project targets, schedules and safeguards are&#13;
followed.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Procurement&#13;
&#13;
56.     The PMU of MUDH, assisted by the TSU, will have the overall responsibility for&#13;
procurement underthe project. The PMUwill appoint two procurement staff who will be assisted&#13;
by a procurement specialist in the TSU. The analysis shows that Afghanistan is a "high risk"&#13;
country from a public procurement point of view. The procurement procedures and procurement&#13;
plan for the project are developed keeping in view the public procurement environment in the&#13;
country. Thus, consideration i s given to risk minimization by further developing procurement&#13;
capacity within the PMU, which will work closely with the Government Procurement Unit(GPU)&#13;
of the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services (ARDS) in the Ministry o f&#13;
Reconstruction andwith the procurement specialist of the TSU.&#13;
&#13;
57.     Goods, works and consulting services financed under the Project shall be procured by&#13;
MUDHinaccordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines for Selection and&#13;
Employment o f Consultants, and using the Bank's model standard bidding documents. Each&#13;
contract for works estimated to be equivalent of US$500,000 or more shall be subject to prior&#13;
review. Irrespective o f value, the first contracts for works and goods for eachyear o f the project&#13;
will be subject to prior review. The first contract for goods up to US$lOO,OOO and all contracts&#13;
for goods above US$lOO,OOO shall be subject to prior review. Each contract for employment o f&#13;
consulting firms estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more, and US$50,000 or more in case o f&#13;
individual consultants, shall be subject to prior review by IDA. All other contracts will be subject&#13;
to post awardreview.For most consulting services, the preferred selection methodwill be Quality&#13;
andCost BasedSelection (QCBS) method.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Disbursementand FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
58.     Through the engagement o f the Financial Management Agent, the Government is now in&#13;
a position to ensure proper accounting for local payments. In addition it has also put in place&#13;
certain additional mechanisms such as (i)the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) under the&#13;
Treasury for disbursements and maintenance o f Afghanistan Management Information System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(AFMIS); (ii) Development Budget and External Relations (DBER) Unit for overall management&#13;
and reporting of all donor projects; and (iii) the CashManagement Unit, to undertake accounting&#13;
for all income and manage cash resources, under the overall charge of the Treasury Department&#13;
o fthe Ministryof Finance.&#13;
&#13;
59.      The proposed project specific measures include the engagement o f a Financial&#13;
Management Specialist as part o f the TSU to assist the nationally staffed PMUwithin MUDHas&#13;
well as the Project Support Team (PST) of the Kabul Municipality. This i s crucial considering&#13;
the project involves a number o f agencies and consultants and it i s important that there i s a&#13;
designated person to ensure proper financial management arrangements for these agencies. The&#13;
other measure i s the mobilization o f a Consultant ChiefFinancial Officer (CCFO), retained under&#13;
the ARTF-financed Strengthening Financial Capacity project, to support budgeting and financial&#13;
management of the Ministry as a whole. The CCFO will work closely with the Government&#13;
appointed Chief Financial Officer/ Finance Manager in the Ministry to strengthen its capacity to&#13;
manage its reconstructioddevelopment program, including donor-financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
60.      The PMU, assistedbythe TSU, will develop a Project ImplementationManual (PIM)&#13;
with a section on `Funds Flow andFinancial Management' whichcovers procedures as well as&#13;
internal controls o f various aspects of the overall flow o f funds, the fundtransfer mechanism,&#13;
disbursement to communities, and fundmanagement at the community level. This will also&#13;
include the responsibilities o f the PD&amp;C Consultants working on Area Upgrading(Component&#13;
A) withrespectto compliance with transparencyrules for projectexpenditures. PartDofthe&#13;
project will assist Kabul Municipality with enhancing the financial management systems of the&#13;
Municipality. The output could form a basis for further reforms inother municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
61.      The Project will follow standard Government financial management policies and&#13;
procedures, including using the Chart of Accounts developed by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent, to recordProject expenditures. Ultimately the SDUinTreasury Department of MOF will&#13;
be responsible for accounting of all expenditures and receipts in the Government's accounting&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
62.      The MUDH's PMU assistedby the TSU, will be responsible for coordinating financial&#13;
management activities of implementingagencies with the SDU. Considering that there will be a&#13;
number of agencies and consulting organizations that it will be dealing with, it is important that&#13;
the PMU's own responsibilities, hnctions and necessary procedures are developed and&#13;
documented in a brief set of guidelines as part o f the Project Implementation Manual. The&#13;
guidelines are not expected to be an elaborate document, but sufficient to cover various aspects of&#13;
financial managementwhich the PMU, assistedby the TSU, will handle.&#13;
&#13;
63.      The Project Implementation Manual will lay down clear instructions on how different&#13;
agencies will ensure the necessary fiduciary controls over expenditures incurred by them. The&#13;
guidelines will be authorized by the MOF, considering it has the overall responsibility o f&#13;
fiduciary compliance. Inaddition, the Counterpart Chief Financial Officer, CFO and the Financial&#13;
Management Specialist o f the TSU will assist the MUDHto record financial transactions o f the&#13;
project in an electronic format, using simple spreadsheet and/or database applications. Such&#13;
recordingo f data should enable the PMUandTSUinMUDHto retrieve financial information for&#13;
producingthe FinancialMonitoring Reports (FMR)informats to be agreedwiththe World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
64.      Annual project accounts will be consolidated inthe Ministryo f Finance, inparticular, the&#13;
Treasury Department, supported by the Financial Management Agent, and consolidated Project&#13;
financial statementswill be prepared for all sources and uses of Project funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65.     Audit Arrangements. The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General,&#13;
with the support of the Audit Agent, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The&#13;
audit of the Project accounts will include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy of the accounting&#13;
and intemal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions;&#13;
and (c) the eligbility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing. The annual Project&#13;
financial statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, will be&#13;
submitted within six months o f the close of fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f each year. All&#13;
agencies involvedinimplementationand holdingrecords of expenditures will need to retainthese&#13;
records as per the retentionrequirements ofthe Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
66.     Financing Percentage. Since collection of tax revenue has just begun and i s sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentageshave been set at 100% with the understanding, however, that MOF will&#13;
submit withdrawal applications on anet-of-tax basis. The tax structure ofthe government will be&#13;
reviewed periodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages&#13;
needto be set and financing percentagesamended accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with&#13;
fulldocumentation or against statementsofexpenditures as appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
68.     Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs).           SOE thresholds are applicable for&#13;
procurement made. Disbursements will be made on the basis o f SOEs for all works less than&#13;
US$500,000; goods less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent, consultants' services for firms less than&#13;
US$lOO,OOO, for individual consultant less than US$50,000 equivalent, all training, audits and&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
69.     Special Account. A special account will be opened and maintained in Da Afghanistan&#13;
Bank or a commercial bank in Afghanistan on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA; and will&#13;
be operated in accordance with IDA'Soperational policies. The Authorized Allocation o f the&#13;
Special Account will be set not to exceed $2 million which i s the four month average estimated&#13;
expenditure to be paid from the account.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Minimum application size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) monthly, regardless of amount, or (b) when the Special Account balance i s reduced&#13;
by 40% of the Authorized Allocation ($800,000), whichever comes first.              The minimum&#13;
application size for withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct payment, or for&#13;
applications for Special Commitments i s 20% o f the Authorized Allocation o f the Special&#13;
Account, Le., $400,000.&#13;
&#13;
D.      Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
71.     The principles goveming social and environmental management will be applied through&#13;
an Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework) which i s attached, without&#13;
appendices, in Appendix 11. The Framework i s applicable to all activities financed by the&#13;
proposed Project, and includes (i)key policy principles for social and environmental&#13;
management, (ii)tools to guide the screening o f subprojects for significant social and&#13;
environmental impacts, and to assist in the mitigation of such impacts, (iii) procedures to ensure&#13;
that these principles and tools are appropriately applied, and (iv) guidelines for capacity building&#13;
and monitoring. The Framework will be operationalized through the proposed Project's&#13;
arrangements for implementation, capacity buildingand monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72.     The reconstruction and rehabilitation interventions envisaged under the proposed project&#13;
are not expected to generate significant negative environmental effects. Rather, they should&#13;
contributeto the improvementof environmental conditions. Limitedadverseimpacts could result,&#13;
however, from inadequatedesign and construction practices. To limit the extent of these risks, the&#13;
Framework provides a negative list of activities ineligible for support under the proposed project.&#13;
To mitigate the remaining potential impacts, the guidelines and codes of practice included inthe&#13;
Framework provide social and environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated in the&#13;
design, contractingand monitoring o f infrastructure developments.&#13;
&#13;
73.     No activities will be supported that require involuntary landacquisitionor the acquisition&#13;
o f land requiring the resettlement or compensation o f more than 200 people. Consequently, no&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan will be required for the proposed project. The voluntary donation or&#13;
compensated contribution o f land for activities will be guided by the appendix "Guidelines for&#13;
Landand Asset Acquisition, Entitlementsand Compensation" includedinthe Framework.&#13;
&#13;
74.      Giventhe nature o f the operation (being processedunder OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery&#13;
Assistance) and the proposed activities for IDA financing, an exemption has been obtained from&#13;
the requirement to make the Framework publicly available prior to appraisal. The Framework&#13;
will, however, be made publicly available inAfghanistan and at the World Bank Info Shop prior&#13;
to presentation of the proposedproject to the World BankBoard.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The components of the project will benefit households in general by providing increased&#13;
level of services includingwater, sanitation and pedestrian and vehicular access. While women&#13;
and children are not specifically targeted, they will be the primary beneficiaries of the&#13;
interventions in water and sanitation in terms of health gains and reduced workload in water&#13;
collection. The realization of these benefits will be ensured through the provision of health&#13;
education as part of the water and sanitation interventions.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The identification of areas for upgradingwill apply procedures and selection criteria that&#13;
will minimize the riskof ethnic bias.&#13;
&#13;
77.      The types of public works planned under the project are not expected to generate labor&#13;
opportunities for women to any significant degree. Duringthe process o f consultations with local&#13;
communities, separate arrangements shall be made to ensure participation by and consultation&#13;
with women, as they can not be expected to be covered through the general community&#13;
consultations.&#13;
&#13;
E.       MonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
78.      Monitoring arrangements include plans for intensive supervision by the Bank to ensure&#13;
that any implementation difficulties are dealt with promptly. At a minimum, a full supervision&#13;
mission i s needed quarterly, with specialists visiting Afghanistan more frequently if needed&#13;
during Project implementation. A quarterly progress report will be prepared and submitted to&#13;
IDA, which consolidates all components including progress towards meetingimplementationand&#13;
development objectives, as further detailed in the Project's procurement plan and detailed&#13;
monitoring indicators. Responsibility for this reporting rests with the MUDH. Appendix 12&#13;
providesadditional details onmonitoringindicators for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
F.       ConditionofProjectDisbursement&#13;
&#13;
79.      The approval by Government o fanagreedlist o f settlements to beupgraded inKabul&#13;
underPart A ofthe project will be a conditionof disbursement.&#13;
&#13;

                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
G.      Justification&#13;
&#13;
80.     This project i s expected to be the start o f a longer term involvement of the World Bank&#13;
Group inselected urban infrastructure sub-sectors. This first operation will, apart from emergency&#13;
assistance, set the stage for increasing access to sustainable urban infrastructure services. In&#13;
addition to the creation o f suitable legal and regulatory frameworks, capacity building efforts&#13;
supported by the Project will help to create absorptive capacity for handling donor assistance,&#13;
community driven development as well as other forms o f private sector involvement across&#13;
infrastructure sectors.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
81.     Kabul City has grown rapidly since the fall o fthe Taliban in2001,increasing from an&#13;
estimated 1.7 million in2000 to about 2.7 millionin2003. Additionally, at least 300,000&#13;
Afghans enter the city every morning, bringingthe effective daytime populationto a little&#13;
over three million. Only 40% o fthe roughly 325 kilometer square areais planned. Most&#13;
residents thus live inunserviced or under-serviced unplannedareas. For administrative&#13;
purposes, the city is dividedinto 16districts, of which three districts are peri-urban and&#13;
sparsely populated. Everydistrict is further dividedinto zones (about 3-5 zonesper district)&#13;
andeachzone is further divided intogozars. Eachgozar consists ofabout 200 households&#13;
representedby a local wakeel.&#13;
&#13;
82.     The City is governedbythe Municipality o f Kabul. The KMis reasonably&#13;
autonomous, responsible for its ownbudget and staffing. The Mayor o f Kabulhas the status&#13;
o f a Minister.The KMcontrols some, but not all, delivery o f services. It i s responsible for&#13;
the implementationo fthe city's masterplan;" constkctionof canals, ditches, flood&#13;
protectionmeasures; solidwaste management; supervision o fpublic parks; greening the city;&#13;
construction and paving o froads; control o f food prices; distribution o f landplots for&#13;
commercial andresidential purposes; recovery o fresidential sites; cultural services and&#13;
expansion o f foodmarkets. However, water supply inthe city i s controlledby Central&#13;
Authority for Water Supply and Sanitation (CAWSS) which falls under the Ministryo f Urban&#13;
Development andHousing. The Soviet styled public housing, the Macro-Rayans, are&#13;
controlledbythe MUDH; public urbantransport is controlledbythe Ministryo fTransport&#13;
while traffic managementfalls under the MOI. This institutional fragmentation makes co-&#13;
ordination of service delivery difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
&#13;
83.     Introduction. Most o fthe urbanwater supplysystems inKabuland other towns have&#13;
beenseverely damagedeither directly duringthe period of conflict, or indirectly due to the&#13;
prolongedperiod o fneglect andlack o f maintenance. As a result the systems are operating at&#13;
very low levels of efficiency. Sourceyields are adversely affected by deterioration inthe&#13;
boreholes, lack o f appropriate pumps, and fluctuatingpower supplies. The distribution&#13;
networks have beenbroken and mendedhaphazardly usingany available pipe materials and&#13;
informal connections are widespread. Significant partso fthe systemshave beencut off from&#13;
the network andthere are alargenumberofalternative systemswhichhavebeenbuiltaround&#13;
newbore-wells.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Consumersand Coverage.Today, the pipednetwork yields only 8000 m3per day,&#13;
although this is animprovement from the 5000m3lday low in 1994. The majority o fthe&#13;
populationobtaintheir water from the approximately 800 wells located around the city.&#13;
There i s heavy reliance on local or on-site water and sanitation solutions. Pipedwater&#13;
coverage is extremely low. CAWSS serves 31,500 connections inKabul, which i s an&#13;
estimated 20% o fKabul's population. Cost recovery is very low. InKabul in2001 CAWSS&#13;
billedless than US$150,000 (or less thanUS$5 per connection) o fwhich only about 18% was&#13;
collected. The low levels o f collection is due inpart to the confused situationwith regardto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loThe 1978 master plan was not implemented fully, reportedly due to insufficient funds, lack o f&#13;
management and planningcapacity. Unplanned shelter expansionoccurred, with other govemment&#13;
agencies also contnbutingthrough the construction of facilities without referenceto the master plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tenure andthe inabilityo f government institutions to pay their bills. Poor collectioni s&#13;
exacerbatedbythe poor level ofmetering'          '.&#13;
Bulk Supply.There are three main sources ofwater for Kabul12: the Allaudin wellfield,&#13;
developed between 1930 and 1954, consists of springs below the Qargha Damandfour deep&#13;
wells at Alaudin; the Afshar Wellfield; andthe Logar wellfields.Mucho fthe population&#13;
relies on shallow wells andirrigation canals. The public water supply network does not&#13;
extend to the suburbs.At their height, the maximum productionrate o fpipednetwork was&#13;
86,000 m3/day(100Olh). This was still below the required needs, andthe city was also served&#13;
by approximately 100,000 shallowwells.&#13;
&#13;
85.        Microruyuns. Water is supplied via 13 deep abstraction boreholes o f depth 100-120m&#13;
andinstalledwith electrical submersiblepumpsofcapacity 25-40 l/s. Fromthese, water is&#13;
distributedthroughout the complex via a hillsidereservoir, although recently it i sbeing&#13;
pumpeddirectly into the network.&#13;
&#13;
86.        Issues. Keyissuesinthe water sector include: lack o fcurrent hydro-geological&#13;
studes or user demanddata; lack o f water management strategies; limited access to, and&#13;
affordability of, pipedsupplies; incremental augmentation of supply systemvia shallow tube&#13;
wells; unknown loss due to leaks andillegal connections; poor billingandcost-recovery&#13;
systems; clarification o fthe potentialrole o fthe private sector; integrationo fwater supply&#13;
schemes into spatial plans; andthe need for coordination between agenciesat the national and&#13;
local~evels.'~&#13;
&#13;
87.        Future Plans. KfW (German Bank for Reconstruction), i s funding an urgent water&#13;
supply rehabilitationproject, intwo phases(total value of first phaseapprox. US$9.5 m,&#13;
implemented from mid-2002 to mid-2004). KfWis also funding a feasibility study for the&#13;
extension o fthe Kabul water supply system, carried out from January 2003 to January 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Sewerage&#13;
&#13;
88.        Introduction. Access to sewerage is limitedinKabul to the Microrayans. Fortyfive&#13;
percent ofthe population use septic tanks for wastewater disposal. However, since the water&#13;
table is htghinsettled areas, the water wells are underthe risk o fpollution.&#13;
&#13;
89.        Status Quo: Excreta disposal systems inKabul are o f4 different types:&#13;
&#13;
           a. The vast majority are on-site systems, including single and double pit latrines and&#13;
               variations on a traditional model o fvault toilet which opensto the street to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ''In&#13;
~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Kabul, both volumetric and flat rates are used, depending on whether the connection i s equipped&#13;
with a meter. Current volumetric rates are Afg. 1000 / m3 for households($0.03 / m3), and Afg.&#13;
4500/m3 for offices andNGOs ($0.13/m3). Few meters are likely to be operational at the current time.&#13;
For those connections without a meter, rates are Afg. 120/year ($3.43/year) for ?4inch connections,&#13;
Afg. 240 /year for %inch connections, andAfg. 480 /year for 1inch connections. Connectionfees are&#13;
Afg. 100,000 for ?4 inchconnections, Afg. 200 for %inch connections, and Afg. 400 for 1inch&#13;
connections. A labor charge o f Afg. 80 has to be paid inaddition to the connection fee. Consumers&#13;
haveto be settle their bills at localbranches o fthe Afghan Bank, which then transfers the money to&#13;
CAWSS own Bank account.&#13;
 ''Inthe 1980s Kabul City received water by gravitation through a cast-iron pipe from the Paghman&#13;
district, located some 15kmfrom Kabul. This network is not hnctioning at present.&#13;
 l3Four Ministriesare responsible for water: (i)Agriculture, (ii) Resources, Irrigation &amp;&#13;
                                                                Water&#13;
Environment, (iii)Rural Reconstruction and Development and Public Works, while the central technical&#13;
agency, CAWSS is under the (iv) MUDH. As part o fthe Urban Program Secretariat, a Water Sector&#13;
Committee has been established at the national level for information exchange and coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              facilitate the removal o fnightsoil. There are also about 17publictoilets all over&#13;
              Kabul out of which only 3 are inservice.&#13;
&#13;
         b. Flushtoilets are more common inhigher classresidential andcommercial areas,&#13;
              where wastewater i s collected inunlinedpits andpermeateinto the ground.&#13;
&#13;
         c.   Inlargerbuildingsincludingagencyandgovernment offices, septic tanks and&#13;
              permeation pitsare typically used. Several apartment complexes have septic&#13;
              tanks but these are not maintained as vacuum trucks are not available andsewage&#13;
              spills fromthe permeation pits.&#13;
&#13;
         d. Sewerageis limitedto 4 apartmentcomplexes, Microrayan 1,2,3 and4 in&#13;
              Districts 16 and9, and serve aresident populationo f about 120,000. Sewageis&#13;
              conveyed (2 km)to a wastewater treatment plantof atotal capacity o f about&#13;
              15,000 m3/day. Due to O&amp;M problems, wastewater ispartially treated (limitedto&#13;
              separationand sedimentation) before beingdischargedinthe Kabul river.&#13;
&#13;
90.      Nightsoiland sludge collection is minimal as there are only 2 Municipalvacuum&#13;
trucks operating inKabul. Privatevacuum trucks have beendischarging waste inan&#13;
uncontrolled manner. Collected nightsoil is disposedo f outside the city boundary inDesert&#13;
Chemtalla inthe north andPuli Churkhi inthe east.&#13;
&#13;
91.      Muchofthe southernpart ofthe cityhasbeendestroyed; this area, alongwithnew&#13;
under servedsettlementswhichcan already be seenonthe outshrts ofthe city, will require&#13;
rapid strategic interventions to ensurethat the sanitation situation does not deteriorate. Inthe&#13;
1970sthe municipalityprepared a masterplanfor sewerage interventions butno investments&#13;
were made14.&#13;
&#13;
92.      ICRC (International Committee o fthe RedCross) hasbeen constructing more than&#13;
50,000 latrines andtoilets inthe city over the past 5 years, andhas also prepared detailed&#13;
assessmentsand mappingo f the sanitation facilities inKabul. Other NGOs such as German&#13;
Agro Action, ACTED, CARE, Mercy Corps, MEDAIR, have been involved inthe provision&#13;
o fvarious on-site sanitation facilities, hygiene promotionprograms, solid waste collection.&#13;
&#13;
93.      A few major studies were carriedout inthe late 1970s, includingthe Kabul Sanitation&#13;
Report (1979) andthe Kabul Sewerage Master Plan commissioned by UNDP in 1972.&#13;
However, giventhe very low revenue base, the lack o ftechcal andmanagerial capacity, and&#13;
other sector constraints, particularlyunreliable electricity supply, it is evident that capital-&#13;
intensive solutions such as conventional sewerageand wastewater treatment (envisaged under&#13;
the Master Planpreparedinthe 1970's) will notbe feasible inthe short- and medium-term,&#13;
withthe possible exception ina few densely populated areas ofKabul.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l4In1972, the UNDPcommissioned a series of30 Year Master PlansandFirst StageFeasibility&#13;
Studies for the Greater Kabul Area. The studies covered Water Supply, Sewerage, Drainage and Solid&#13;
Wastes. Studies were also undertakenon Organization, Management, Financial and Legal aspects. The&#13;
2004 population was projected to be 2,000,000. On completion o fthe studies, the Central Authority for&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage(CAWSS) was formed, and the World Bank (IDA) agreed to finance the&#13;
First and SecondWater Supply Projects andthe First Sewerage Project. The First Sewerage project&#13;
comprised collection sewers inthe New Urban Area and ShareNau, with treatment inwastewater&#13;
stabilization ponds. Engineering Design and Construction o fthe First Water Project was completed&#13;
between 1975 and 1986. Engineering Designo fthe Second Water Project and the First Sewerage&#13;
Project were partially completed between 1978 and 1979. No construction work was done on the&#13;
Second Water Project, or on the Sewerage Project. (See more details in a paper byFrank Moir, dated&#13;
September 2002, entitled "Water And Sanitation Planning For The City O fKabul: A Review OfThe&#13;
1974 UNDP-Sponsored Water And Sewerage Master Plans, AndThe Implementation OfThe First&#13;
Stage Projects)&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
94.       Therefore, a progressive approachto improving environmental sanitation conditions&#13;
is encouraged.The government's strategy for improving the sanitation situation inKabul&#13;
consists o f the following phases: (1) assessmento fthe existingsanitation situation, (2)&#13;
definition o fthe principles underpinningstrategic sanitation planning, (3) identification,&#13;
design andimplementationpriority rehabilitationneeds, (4) identification andmobilization o f&#13;
appropriate partners for operation andmaintenance(e.g. solid waste collection etc), and (5)&#13;
identification o f alternatives for medium-andlong-terminterventions, (6) implementation o f&#13;
medium-andlong-term interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Solidwaste management&#13;
&#13;
95.       Household Waste forms the largest component o f solid waste. The averageper-capita&#13;
waste generation rate is approximately 0.4 kgper day. The averageresident o f some districts&#13;
probably generates less waste (as low as 0.2 kgkapitdday) while inother districts residents&#13;
generatemore waste on average (up to 0.5 kdcapitdday). There is no information on&#13;
industrial waste. The 22 hospitals o f Kabulappear to burntheir waste on site and/or disposed&#13;
with the domestic waste stream. Waste collectioninKabul occurs intwo stages:&#13;
&#13;
              Primary collection: Residentsand community organizations remove waste&#13;
                  manually from households, which are referredto as primary collectionpoints,&#13;
                  and dump them at loosely designatedcollectiodtransfer points, or so-called&#13;
                  secondarycollection points.&#13;
              Secondary collection: Waste collection vehicles from the Department o f&#13;
                   Sanitation (DOS) then remove solid waste fromthese secondarycollection&#13;
                  points and haul themto Gazak dumpingsite situated about 15 kmeast of&#13;
                  Kabul City. The site is also 30 kmfromthe DOS vehicle pool where the&#13;
                  trucks take off every moming and returnevery afternoon.&#13;
&#13;
96.       The DOS collects 300 tonnes of solid waste from the streets o f Kabul every day. This&#13;
is well below the average rate o fwaste generation inKabul (about 1,280 tonnes per day).&#13;
Waste collectionby Kabul Municipalityi s adhoc. There is no specific routing planassigned&#13;
to each o fthe 40 vehicles and crew belongingto KM.Furthermore, the existing collection&#13;
vehicles are small insize (3-5 m3 capacity) anddnvers currently conduct only two tripsper&#13;
day. Inthe most accessible andvisible partsofKabul, waste i s collected onceper week. In&#13;
other parts o fthe city, where streets are narrow andgenerally unpaved, the frequency of&#13;
collection drops as low as once permonth.&#13;
&#13;
 97.      Cost of Current SWMSystem. Since the establishment o fthe new dumpingsite at&#13;
 Gazak,the costs recordedhave increasedto almost US$20,500, principally due to increased&#13;
 fuel consumption. This sum does not reflect total S W M expenditures such as salaries,&#13;
 insurance, depreciation of collectionvehicles, etc. A drive acrossKabul City reveals&#13;
 significant scavenging andrecycling activities inthe streetsbut there are no recycling&#13;
 facilities inKabul.&#13;
&#13;
 Buildingandconstruction waste (rubble anddebris)&#13;
&#13;
 98.      The reconstruction efforts will involve the massive task o fmanaging huge volumes o f&#13;
 rubble, debris and sediments. Disposalo fenormous quantities o frubble and debris canpose&#13;
 severalproblems that will needto be addressedas part o fthe rubble and debris management&#13;

99.      Introduction The total lengtho fpaved streetslroads inKabulis 309 km,the total&#13;
lengthofunpavedroadslstreetsis about 350 km.However, an estimated60%ofKabulroads&#13;
are damaged-a result ofthe combination o fwar and lack o fmaintenance.&#13;
&#13;
100.     The Construction Department, ofthe Kabul Municipalityis responsible for the&#13;
construction o fnew roadslstreetsor repair andmaintenanceo fthe existing roadslstreets.&#13;
However, it is has very little equipment andi s currently not inapositionto performits related&#13;
tasks.&#13;
&#13;
101.     Future Plans. SinceMay 2002, the GermanMinistryfor Economic Cooperation and&#13;
Development (BMZ) is financing an ongoingRoadRepair Program inKabul City through&#13;
KfWwithinthe framework ofGermanFinancialCooperation (FC) totaling 5 million.The&#13;
program continues for 20 months untilthe endo f 2003. But this consistsmainly o fpatching.&#13;
About l O O k mo froad will be repaired inKabul underthe current programsupportedby&#13;
internationalagencies.Further more substantial roadreconstruction inKabulwill be&#13;
supported underthe KURP.&#13;

Storm-water drainape&#13;
&#13;
102.     Introduction. Kabulhasrelatively lowprecipitationbut when raindoes fall there i s a&#13;
considerable accumulation o f water on the streets inthe city. Roadside drains are mostly&#13;
clogged and inmuch o fthe city needto be rebuilt. Drainage inthe under served settlements&#13;
on the hillsides aroundthe center needs to be looked at as a matter ofurgency. Currently&#13;
NGOs managepart o fthe drain cleaning programbut this needsto beprogressively moved&#13;
into the municipality as capacity i s built.Areas susceptible to erosion or flooding due to storm&#13;
water, or areas where sullagelwastewater are connectedto existing drains and causing&#13;
problems will be identified. Neighborhoodneeds for improved drainage (tertiary drains) will&#13;
also be assessed.&#13;
&#13;
 103.    Future Plans. There i s a study inthe pipeline inwhich consultantswill review the&#13;
conditions o fthe existing drainagenetworks and assess the need for additional collectors.&#13;
Preliminary design o fthe additional drains are to be prepared. The consultant will review,&#13;
maps o f groundwater, drainagebasins, topography etc. An assessmentofthe non-institutional&#13;
causes (blockage with garbage andsand, collapse, poor construction etc.) o fpoor drain&#13;
maintenance willbe made.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
1.       Area upgrading" o fpoor, infrastructure deficient, planned andunplanned&#13;
neighborhoods will be carried out inselectedareas, followingaparticipatoryprocess&#13;
involvingthe respective community groups. The process for the selection of communities i s&#13;
underway. The project component i s structured intwo phases to enablean early start Inthe&#13;
context o fthe project a community may be a "gozar" (sub-district), a number o f gozars&#13;
combined or, possibly, parts o fa gozar.&#13;
&#13;
Selectionof Settlements&#13;
&#13;
2.       Eligbility Criteria: Vulnerability anddeficiency inservice delivery are the key&#13;
criteria determiningsite selection16.The measures for each include17:&#13;
    0    Vulnerability:&#13;
                   o # ofvulnerable people&#13;
                   o Density&#13;
                   o Conditionofhousing&#13;
         Deficienciesinservices:&#13;
                   o Water (piped supply, in-house well, public well, tanker)&#13;
                   o Sanitation (none in-house, latrineto night soil, improvedlatrine)&#13;
    Indicators for eacho fthesevariables will be decided uponand a scoring system&#13;
    developed on completion o f data collection.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Processo f Selection ofareas for engagementinKU". Selection o f areas for&#13;
engagementinKURPwill occur infour stages:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Stage One: Identificationo fEligibleNei&amp;borhoods Usingseveral data sourcesall&#13;
         neighborhoods onpublic landinKabul will berated inaccordance with the eligibility&#13;
         criteria. A list o fneighborhoods eligible for upgradingwill become apparentthrough&#13;
         this process.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Stage Two: Phasinp o f Works. Subsequently, the eligible neighborhoods will be&#13;
         phased", basedon the viability o fproviding network infrastructure to the area during&#13;
         the life cycle o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Stage Three: Identificationo fTarget Areas for Uunading. Subsequent to the&#13;
         selection o fproject eligible neighborhoods, target areas for upgradingwithin the&#13;
         neighborhoods will be identifiedbasedon ahousehold survey. This will bebasedon&#13;
         a further iteration o fvulnerability, service deficiencies and geographic clustering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
''Area  upgrading is defined as the improvement o f basic tertiary infrastructure and services, in this&#13;
case, water supply, sanitation, access, drainage, solid waste management and street lightingthat&#13;
respond to community needs and demands and which are planned and designed inconjunction with&#13;
communities and which are constructed incomprehensive area-based packagesthrough local&#13;
contractors and community groups, dependent on the type o f work. Upgrading also includes the&#13;
a propriate replanning and restructuring o fthe physical environment.&#13;
"Data sources include WFP, UNAMA, CSO. Another data source will be a household survey carried&#13;
out as part o fthe Settlement Selection exercise usedto identify settlements suitable for inclusion inthe&#13;
project.&#13;
  More may be added depending on results o fthe survey.&#13;
  Phase 1and 2 within project and remainder for future project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
UpgradingProjectPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
4.      Itis commonto adopt a set ofprinciples to guidenot onlythe selection of&#13;
communities but the planning, design andimplementation o fupgradingprojects at a large&#13;
scale. The following is a sumfnary o fnineprinciplesto be applied inthe KURP.&#13;
&#13;
    i)Appropriateservicelevelsandstandards:Thefundamentalprincipleisthatschemes&#13;
    shouldbe designedto affordable servicelevels/standardsthat provide services that canbe&#13;
    sustained. Infrastructure improvements should beplanned anddesignedto functional&#13;
    standarddservice levels and to strict cost targets (on aper hectare/ per householdandor&#13;
    per capita basis) for affordability and replicability/equity reasons. However life cycle&#13;
    costs needto be considered. It is usuallyunwise to compromise construction standards&#13;
    butplanning standardsandservice levelsmayberelaxedandthe concept of"incremental&#13;
    improvement" adopted. This is aprinciple to be adoptedinKURP.&#13;
&#13;
    ii)ChoiceandCosts:Inchoosingservicelevelsistandardscommunitiesshouldbegiven&#13;
    choice and should know the cost implications o f choosing one service level against&#13;
    another. A matrix outlining service levels andcostsi s often useful indialogue with&#13;
    communities. An example developed from work done with assistanceo fthe MUDHteam&#13;
    is includedas Attachment 1.The ability/willingness o fbeneficiaries to pay consumption&#13;
    charges for remunerative services supplied(e.g water supply), as well as contribution to&#13;
    capital costs, should also be considered when discussing service levels and cost&#13;
    implications with communities.&#13;
&#13;
    iii)BalancedProgramforImpact:Wlstframingtheprojectbasedoncommunity&#13;
    priorities for basic municipal services andaffordability, it is still important to ensure a&#13;
    "balanced" program o f improvements (say 4 o fthe 6 components on a "menu") for&#13;
    reasonso f impacthsibility andto avoid skewedinvestment (e.g. excessiveexpenditure&#13;
    on roads at the expense o fsanitation). Such aprinciple, which achieves markedvisible&#13;
    changeto the community, has been shown to encourage subsequentinvestment by&#13;
    community residents intheir housing stock, investment insmall scalebusiness inthe&#13;
    areas anda more positive attitude to payment o f local levies such as property tax,&#13;
    consumer charges as well as achieving protection, bythe community, o f assetsupgraded.&#13;
&#13;
    iv) Efjciency of Infrastructure Provision: Whereascommunities maywish, andshouldbe&#13;
    encouragedto participate not only in decision-making andplanningof their communities,&#13;
    the efficiency o finfrastructure provisionshould also be considered. The design o fthe&#13;
    network infrastructure should be cognizant o fthe longer-terminfrastructure development&#13;
    plans ofthe various responsible authorities (e.g. KMfor roads anddrainage andCAWSS&#13;
    for water supply). Proposalsagreedwill not usually provide a "full" level o f service at the&#13;
    outsetbut will be major step towards achievement of such a service level. Experience has&#13;
    shown that "network" infrastructure is normally best provided over a larger areainone&#13;
    package usingexperienced workmanship and supervision. Single sectoral initiatives often&#13;
    result incontinual disruptionof communities and damage o f one service (e.g. road) while&#13;
    implementinga subsequentservice (e.g. water supply). Coordinationo fvarious sector&#13;
    improvements i snormally best handled by an experienced group (e.g. local contractor).&#13;
    However "stand-alone elements" ofupgradingproposals (e.g. fixed solid waste&#13;
    containers, pit latrine and/or septic tank construction) better lendthemselves to&#13;
    community contracting and such implementationmethods should be considered for such&#13;
    components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   v) Supervision of Worksand Transparency:Tobetter ensure a good quality of&#13;
   workmanship and materials by contractors and communities (where community&#13;
   contracting is included) thenConstruction Management`supervision consultants should&#13;
   be engaged. For consistency this is often best providedby the consultantsthat carry out&#13;
   the community facilitation, planningand design. Inaddition, for transparencyreasons,&#13;
   representatives ofrespective communities shouldbe includedinperiodic site meetings&#13;
   between PMU/PST/TSU, contractors and construction management consultants andin&#13;
   measuremento fworks done.&#13;
&#13;
   vi) Community Upgrading Plans: Details andplans ofthe facilities to be upgraded,&#13;
   capital andoperation &amp; maintenance(0&amp; M) costs, 0 &amp; Mmodalities, funding&#13;
   arrangements, implementation arrangements etc. should all be set out in"Community&#13;
   UpgradingPlans" to which eachcommunity (via its Community BasedOrganization(s))&#13;
   and responsible 0 &amp; Magencies(e.g. Municipalityandutilityagencies) formally agree.&#13;
&#13;
   vii) CostRecovery and Community Contributions: To foster greaterownership and&#13;
   responsibilityby the respective communities, communities should make some&#13;
   contribution to capital costs, however modest. This couldbe done invarious ways that&#13;
   should be considered duringthe planningphase. For example, with regard to utility&#13;
   provision (e.g water supply) capital costs for provisioncouldberecovered over time&#13;
   through a supplementto the tariff structure, where house connections are provided, which&#13;
   may be more affordable to householders.With standpipe provisioncosts charged for&#13;
   water could include a capital recovery element. Insome upgrading schemes carried out in&#13;
   other countries, Citieshhnicipalitieshave contributed a share of capital costs, rather than&#13;
   all costs funded through Central Government. InKabul it is expectedthat capital&#13;
    contributions from communities will bebetween 5-10% inline with other initiatives (e.g.&#13;
   UNHabitat).&#13;
&#13;
   viii) TrunkInfrastructure: "Off-site'' primaryor trunk infrastructure mayberequiredto&#13;
    ensurethat secondary andtertiary infrastructure providedi s able to operate effectively.&#13;
    Critical "links", not beingprovidedinon-going or foreseeableprojects needto be&#13;
    identified duringthe selection andplanningstages. Also critical on-site social&#13;
    infrastructure extensionsandrehabilitationmaybe requiredifnot beingprovidedunder&#13;
    on-going programs. Allowances have beenmade inthe project cost estimates for such&#13;
    links.&#13;
&#13;
    ix) Minimal Resettlement: Physical proposals should apply planningand engineering&#13;
    standardsflexibly to ensuresensitive, least cost proposals that avoid demolitiono f&#13;
    dwellings/commercial establishmentsand thus involve only minimal involuntary&#13;
    resettlement. Inthe case o fthe KURPthere will be no resettlement.&#13;
&#13;

design andconstruction standards that may be providedi s set out below. Attachments 1,2 and&#13;
3 set these out inmore detail together with costs.&#13;
&#13;
    i) Water Supply: Sincethe improvement o fthe water supply systems inKabul City are&#13;
    underway with assistance from the GermanGovernment", the project will focus mainly&#13;
    onproviding safe drinkingwater to communities inthe selectedproject neighborhoods in&#13;
    the shortestpossible time.&#13;

            they couldbeprovidedonpayment ofthe necessaryconnection feeby&#13;
            householders.The distributionnetworks providedwill supply community&#13;

            standpost.&#13;
       0    Where access roads are to be laidinthe project areasthenwhere spacei s&#13;
            available, the water supply infrastructure should be laidinservice reserves,&#13;
            preferablyonboth sides o fthe road. Where individual householdconnections are&#13;
            not provided initially, then service ducts will beprovidedacross roads to permit&#13;
            individual connections inthe future without breakinginto the access road.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   Although a selection criterion is "availability o ftrunk infrastructure", limited&#13;
            critical "off-site" links to serve a settlement fromnearbysecondary infrastructure&#13;
            may be provided underthe project andanallowance for t h s hasbeenmade inthe&#13;
            project cost estimates.&#13;
&#13;
            Community standpostswill only beprovidedwhere a community group agrees to&#13;
            take responsibility for operating and maintaining the standpost and for payingthe&#13;
            water bills renderedby CAWSS for water consumed. Each standpostwill be&#13;
            fitted with a water meter as part ofthe project. The details withregardto&#13;
            operation, maintenance, responsibility andpayment for water consumed will be&#13;
            set out inthe Community UpgradingPlan for the specific community.&#13;
&#13;
   ii) Sanitation: A major sanitation study for KabulCity hasrecently commenced with&#13;
   assistance from IDAunder EIRP2'. This will look at, inter alia, the provision o f&#13;
   waterborne sewerage andsewage treatment and disposal as well as improved on-plot&#13;
   facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   At this stage inthe absence of a reliable and ample water supply or secondary,&#13;
            primary sewerage and sewage treatment facilities examination of the appropriate&#13;
            excreta system needs to be made (i.e. twin-tanks system; simple pit, pour-flush,&#13;
            twin-pitpour flush, VIP pit,twin-pitVIP) before designingandconstruction. The&#13;
            project includes for the provision o f improved on-plot latrine arrangements and&#13;
            cost estimateshave allowed sums for this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   The design and implementation of the sanitation sub-component will require&#13;
            careful handling as it involves entry onto "private property" for both survey and&#13;
            construction. Giventhe sensitivity o fthe sub-component construction will be best&#13;
            arranged following community contracting arrangements and such procurement&#13;
            andconstruction arrangementshavebeenbuiltinto the project.&#13;
&#13;
        0   Where access roads are to be laid inthe project areas then appropriate amount o f&#13;
             space mustbe left on either side o f the access road to enable future tertiary (lane)&#13;
             level sewerage systems (either small bore or conventional or combined&#13;
             drainagehewerage systems) to be laid without breahng into the access road.&#13;
            Furthermore, design o f the access road must also cater, through the provision o f&#13;
             ducts, for future pipe crossings at appropriate intervals along the length o f the&#13;
             access road.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
iii) Solid WasteManagement: The Sanitation Study referred to above is also loolung&#13;
at solid waste management, city-wide. Thus, as with water supply and sanitation, the&#13;
proposals for solid waste collectiordcontainerization at the tertiary level should&#13;
endeavor to accord with longer-term proposals wherever possible. At this stage it is&#13;
proposedthat the project will providethe following:&#13;
&#13;
     Fixed brick or concrete built roadside containers o f 1.5m3 - 2 m3 capacity each&#13;
     serving about 10-20 households. Waste will be disposed of into these containers&#13;
     directly by householders or by a system o f community operated handcarts or&#13;
     similar. The stored waste will be periodically collected by either community-&#13;
     based solid waste system or by city trucks, and disposed o f at municipal or&#13;
     district dumpsites.&#13;
&#13;
e    The project may also facilitate the implementation o f Community Based SWM:&#13;
     Primary Collection -House to House waste collection to formal collectionpoints.&#13;
&#13;
     Where necessary, the project may also facilitate the removal o f buildingmaterial&#13;
     andrubblefromproject sites&#13;
&#13;
iv) Access Roads: Access roads will be developed to improve access to sites and&#13;
develop or maintain rights o f way. Road arrangements will define the layouts o f the&#13;
sites and the location o f other infrastructure. Careful attention will be paid duringthe&#13;
preparation o f the road layout in order to avoid affecting any existing superstructure.&#13;
Service levels and standards are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
e    In flat areas, these access roads will be surfaced with cement concrete, water&#13;
     bound or bitumen macaddasphalt or gravel; in the hill areas, the access roads&#13;
     will generally be of lesserwidthbecause o f hfficult terrain but will all be paved&#13;
     to avoid erosion instorm times.&#13;
&#13;
e    Normal road width standardswill be adjusted dependent on availability o f space.&#13;
     Normally local distributor roads withm communities will not exceed 6 m width&#13;
     withminorroads 3.5 meterwidth andfoot access 1.5 mwidth.&#13;
&#13;
 v) Hill-side steps: In some of the selectedproject neighborhoods access to people's&#13;
homes i s very difficult since the houses are often located on steep slopes. In such&#13;
areas the project will:&#13;
&#13;
e    Design andconstruct appropriate hill-side steps.&#13;
&#13;
e    Provide surface water drains adjacent to these hillside steps.&#13;
&#13;
vi) Drainage: Storm water drainage will be provided in communities in accordance&#13;
with overall drainage plans for the area. In all cases, the road construction will be&#13;
complemented by culvert construction, and roadside surface storm-water drains.&#13;
These will normally be o f open rectangular design and constructed with stone or&#13;
concrete. Where not already available an overall drainage plan for the area will be&#13;
prepared by the planning and design consultants talung account of complete&#13;
catchment areas. Hydraulic design will follow localnorms for rainfall andrun-off and&#13;
other drainage design parameters.&#13;
&#13;
vii)Street Lighting: Where there is an existing operational power supply transformer&#13;
station in the project neighborhoods, the project will provide street lighting. In the&#13;
absence o f an existing operational power supply transformer station, alternative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        systems need to be examined, e.g., a community maintained generator with simple&#13;
        distribution systemfor street lights.&#13;
&#13;
        viii) Electricity Supply: This is often a service that is provided under area upgrading&#13;
        projects but int h s case it has not beenincluded. Inparallel with the KURP a major&#13;
        power projec?' ,which will complement the area upgrading component, as regards&#13;
        local distribution, will be implemented. The power project, apart from consolidating&#13;
        and expanding generation and transmission will focus on improvements to&#13;
        distribution systems down to the household connection level. A result o f this will be&#13;
        less electricity loss and generally more efficient supply.&#13;
&#13;
        ix) ) Social Inffastructure:     Where existing facilities such as primary schools,&#13;
        lundergartens, primary health clinics, community halls and similar facilities are&#13;
        inadequate andor inneed o f repair the extension and rehabilitation o f such facilities&#13;
        maybe provided.&#13;
&#13;
Cost BuildUp&#13;
&#13;
6.      Mapping and Model OutlineDesign: Recent satellite imagery(2002) from which&#13;
digitizedbasemapsmaybe producedi s available w i t h the MUDHand this hasbeenused to&#13;
develop modelplans and designs from which service levels, standardsandultimately&#13;
estimated costshudgets for the project component have been developed. The planningand&#13;
design exercise was carried out with a team from the Water and Sanitation Department o f the&#13;
MUDHinthe two "model" settlements, oneonhllylandandoneonrelatively flat land.The&#13;
model design exercise applied generally followed the process outlinedbelow to arrive at the&#13;
component scope and costs. Finalplans and designs for the areas will o f coursebe dependent&#13;
on the community planningprocessto be carried out (see below).&#13;
&#13;
7.      Service Levels and Standards:&#13;
&#13;
    i)Thefundamentalprincipleisthatschemesshouldbedesignedtoaffordableservice&#13;
    levelshtandardsthat provide services that can be sustained. Inconsidering service&#13;
    leveldstandards consideration shouldbe given to the ability/willingness o fbeneficiaries&#13;
    to pay consumption chargesfor remunerative services supplied(e.g water, sewerage), as&#13;
    well as any contributionto capital costs.&#13;
&#13;
    ii)Infrastructureimprovementsshouldbeplannedanddesignedtofunctional&#13;
    standardshervice levels andto strict cost limits (on aper hectare/per capita basis) for&#13;
    affordabilityheplicability reasons.M e r determiningcosts for service level andstandards&#13;
    options, indicative costs for two settlements typologies were calculated (see below). It&#13;
    should be notedthat with regardto costs the most likely componentsthat will be chosen&#13;
    are more "area sensitive" than "population sensitive" andthus costspresentedona per&#13;
    hectare basis are usually more meaningful. Costs will o f coursebe dependent on density,&#13;
    physicalconditions such as topography, soils etc. that mightbe encounteredinthe&#13;
    respective communities andthe condition o f existing infrastructure. Giventhe&#13;
    topographical differences incommunities costs have beenpresented for two differing&#13;
    physicalscenarios,namelysettlements onpredominantly flat landand those on&#13;
    predominantly hilly land.&#13;
&#13;
    iii)Therearedifferenttypesofformal(planned)andinformal(unplanned)settlementsin&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
     iv) Itappears that from aphysicalviewpoint Kabul settlements couldbe dwided into 2 or&#13;
     3 typologies (relatively flat, very steep, andundulating). The outline planning, design and&#13;
     costing exercise carried out looked at two settlements, one o fwhichwas onrelatively flat&#13;
     landwith amore formal layout (Kartenaw) andthe other on steep slopeswith amore&#13;
     informallayout (Siasang). Kartenaw generally has generousrights o f way while Siasang&#13;
     has little access. n   s impacted on the service levels proposed for access ineach-&#13;
     relatively highinKartenaw (for access) but modest inSiasangas the amount o f access&#13;
     proposedwas muchless due to the topographcal and layout difficulties. With regardto&#13;
     standards, two options were costed. These were basedon quality o fmaterials -high&#13;
      (importedfrom Europe) or average (local or importedfrom the region). To enable a cost&#13;
     comparisonbetweenthe intermediate andfull service level scenarios, costs for the latter&#13;
 .   were determined bythe mission. The total indicative costs o fthe upgradingcomponent&#13;
     (excluding any trunk infrastructure requirements) when the model settlement costs are&#13;
     applied to the preliminary list of settlementsproposed are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
8.        Size of Project, Phasing and Costs: Experience has shown that it is unwise to&#13;
sensitizecommunities a long term before it is possible to implement improvements. Thusthe&#13;
4 year project i s dividedinto two phases with Phase 1covering about 40% o fthe project&#13;
(based on settlement area) andPhase 2 coveringabout 60%. Followinga participatoryprocess&#13;
i s also time consuming and it is important to be realistic on what is achievable ina given time&#13;
fraine. The preliminaryanalysis o fpriority settlementsinonly 5 Districts that will likely&#13;
qualify for upgrading totals some 50 settlements covering approximately 2,300 hectares. Thus&#13;
needs are considerable andonly a limitednumber o f settlements canbe coveredby the project&#13;
fromthe viewpoint o ftime as well as available budget.Thus currentproposalsare to&#13;
upgradetertiary infrastructurein a comprehensivemanner insettlementshousing&#13;
approximately250,000 peoplecoveringabout 1000hectares.&#13;
&#13;
9.         For planning, design, procurement andconstruction reasonsthe "size" o f eachphase&#13;
willbe no more than as follows:&#13;
&#13;
           Phase 1-400 ha (approx. 100,000 people) inabout 20 Gozars in 2-4 Districts&#13;
      a    Phase2 -600 ha(approx. 150,000 people) in25 Gozars in2-4 Districts.&#13;
&#13;
10.        At anaveragecost ofUS$17,500 perhathen the total investment requiredfor the&#13;
tertiary infrastructure is US$17,500,000. With an allotment for connections to trunk&#13;
infrastructure, andthe provision of critical extensions andrehabilitationo f social&#13;
infrastructure, the overall cost of the component is $24.19 million. This component will be&#13;
financed by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
11.        Itis inefficientto provide network infrastructure to small areasandthis should bea&#13;
consideration inthe detailedplanningo fthe component. Considering this, a maximum&#13;
community size, andprocurement realities, it i s proposed that eachmajor package o f work in&#13;
a community will cost betweenUS$400,000 andUS$500,000 equivalent to a settlement o f&#13;
about 22-28 hectaresinarea or a maximumsize o f community o fbetween 5,000 - 7,000&#13;
people. Thus a number o f gozars or only partso fgozars maybe covered inany one package&#13;
dependenton settlement size.&#13;
&#13;
CommunityUpgradingPlans&#13;
&#13;
12.        At the outset ofthe planningandengineering stage, bywhichtime the communities&#13;
to beincludedinPhase 1will have been agreedby all interestedparties includingthe World&#13;
Bank, a "semi-formal' planning group (e.g. a Community Based Organisation such as a&#13;
CommunityDevelopment Council or Community Action Group) willbe established within&#13;
the respective selectedcommunities to representthe community indevelopment oftheir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
respective detailed Community UpgradingPlans. The involvement o fthe NGOpartnering the&#13;
consultants will be critical inthe managementand facilitation o fthis process. The process&#13;
will culminate inthe communities' priorities, (withinthe menuoffered) beingincludedina&#13;
preliminary Community Upgrading Plan.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Followingpreliminary engineering andcosting the CUP will be takenback to the&#13;
community for further discussion, modification andagreement. On completion o fthe&#13;
consultations, the initial community proposals will beupdatedbythe consultants and a final&#13;
"Community Upgrading Plan (CUP)" will beproduced for eachcommunity. T h ~will not   s&#13;
only set out the physical layout and details o fthe proposed physical interventions proposed&#13;
butwill outline the participationprocess, the communityorganizations andcommunity&#13;
management structures, costs, routine andperiodic maintenanceprograms andfimding&#13;
proposals for operation andmaintenanceo f facilities to be provided. These will be developed&#13;
bythe consultants inconsultation withMutilityagenciesinfrastructure andservice&#13;
delivery/maintenance departments, District andSub-district officials andthe respective&#13;
communities and will be agreedbetweenall o fthem.&#13;
&#13;
Trunk Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
14.      Inconsidering thelistofsettlementsandthecriteria for final selection of&#13;
communities to participate inthe project, the existingsituationwith regardto trunk&#13;
infrastructure and social facilities (e.g. primary schools, primaryhealthclinics etc) servingthe&#13;
communities needs to be considered. Suchprimaryor trunk infrastructure is requiredto&#13;
ensure that secondaryandtertiary infrastructure provided i s able to operate effectively.&#13;
Existingprovision and current plans (e.g. World Bank,KfW,USAID proposals, and the&#13;
likely timingoftheir implementation, withregardto the city's water supply systemandroad&#13;
systemhave beenreviewed). For Phase 1communities, servicing ofthe proposedtertiary&#13;
infrastructure should generally bepossible from existing systems, likewise existingprovision&#13;
o f social infrastructure should be adequate. However an allowance inthe project hasbeen&#13;
made inorder to provide critical "off-site" trunk infrastructure linksnot beingprovidedby&#13;
others and for extension andrehabilitationo f"on-site" social facilities where these are ahigh&#13;
priority o f a community anddeemedby the planningand design team to be critical.&#13;
&#13;
DetailedPlanningandImplementation&#13;
&#13;
15.      Implementation Arrangements: The proposed implementationarrangementsfor the&#13;
project are set out inAppendix 8. Details o fthe project will be set out ina simple Project&#13;
ImplementationManual (PIM). The content o f the PIM shouldbroadly follow that&#13;
recommendedbythe World Bank.Localconsulting firms with engineeringandcommunity&#13;
consultation skills will be engagedfor community facilitation, detailedplanning, engineering&#13;
design, contract packaging andpreparation o fbiddocuments, and subsequent contract&#13;
managementand construction supervision.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Itis proposed that for bothPhase 1andPhase2, two firms will be engagedto cover&#13;
separate areas. Terms o f Referencehave been drafted for the assignments andprocurement o f&#13;
the consulting serviceshas commenced. The planning, design and contracts management&#13;
consultants will prepare anOperational Manualsetting out the steps followedinthe&#13;
community participation, planning and design exercise. This will serve as a guide for the&#13;
detailed design o fPhase 2 o fthe program, and also guide future upgradingactivities inKabul&#13;
andother cities andtowns inAfghanistan. This requirement hasbeenincluded inthe draft&#13;
Terms o fReference.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Procurement: Contracts for works will be organized on an "area" basis andworks&#13;
doneby local contractors engagedfollowing national competitivebiddingprocedures andby&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
community contracting for smaller "stand-alone" works. A procurement planhasbeen&#13;
prepared(see Appendix 9).&#13;
&#13;
18.      ConstructionManagement/Supervision: This will beprovidedby the localplanning,&#13;
design andcontractsmanagement consultants and i s includedinthe local PD&amp; C TOR.&#13;
Support will beprovidedby the Project Management Unitinthe M'UDHandmore&#13;
specifically the Technical Support Unitto be staffed by consultants.Terms of Reference for&#13;
the TSUhave been drafted.&#13;
&#13;
OperationandMaintenance&#13;
&#13;
19.      Maininfrastructure to be constructed (i.e. water supply distributionnetworks, roads&#13;
anddrains) willbetaken over bythe responsible authorities for subsequentoperationand&#13;
maintenance (i.e. CWASS, KMrespectively). The public standposts to be provided are to be&#13;
operatedbythe community. The standpostswill be fittedwith ameter andthe CBO will be&#13;
responsible for collectingpayments for water suppliedand for payingthe regular water billto&#13;
CAWSS. The modalities for generalmanagement o fthe standpostsandpayment o fthe water&#13;
billwill beworked out through the communityplanningprocess. Gwenthe limitedcapacity&#13;
o f the Kabul Municipality to regularlyclean drains and sweep streets these functions could&#13;
also be carried out through the CBOs. Again the details will be decided uponwith through the&#13;
community planningprocesswith assistanceo fthe planninganddesign consultants. The&#13;
detailed proposals for solidwaste collection will be agreedwith the Kabul Municipalityand&#13;
the systemo f containersproposed will fit into the overall S W M system for the city that is&#13;
currently being designedby others. Operation andmaintenance agreementswill be set out in&#13;
the Community UpgradingPlans.&#13;

                              KabulUrban ReconstructionProject&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Ithasbeenestimatedthat halfto three quarters ofKabul's populationlive in&#13;
settlements o fvaryingdegrees of informality. Landtenure irregularity is common inthese&#13;
settlementsandis thought to be an inhibitingfactor onhouseholdinvestments indwellingand&#13;
neighborhood improvements as well as a source of insecurity andvulnerability. Most of these&#13;
properties are also not includedinthe KabulMakhzan(Registry) thereby limitingthe utility&#13;
o fthis facility despiterecent andongoing recordrestoration andmanagementimprovement&#13;
initiatives. Regularization of landtenure inthese settlementswill reduce the constraints and&#13;
insecurity faced by the settlers andwill help to positionthe KabulMakhzan as aninstitution&#13;
central to the development o f the city.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
2.       This component o fthe Kabul UrbanReconstruction Project (KURP)aims to develop&#13;
an appropriate methodology and capacity to regularize urbanlandtenure inKabul and indue&#13;
course inurbancentersthroughout Afghanistan. The processesandcompetenciesto be&#13;
developed andtested include systematic, site-wide approachesto community mobilization,&#13;
adjudication and dispute resolution, surveying, mappingandregistration. The aimi s to better&#13;
understandthe complexities andinformal arrangementsthat governpresent landtenure&#13;
arrangements, andto devise, test andrefine appropriateprinciples, methods, technologies and&#13;
instruments for all aspects o f tenure regularization which can form the basis of a scaledup&#13;
programfor urbanAfghanistan. Inthis regard, this project component will also set out to&#13;
create aplanfor scaling uptenure regularization for all o f Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
Approach&#13;
&#13;
3.       Systematic, site-wide approachesto community mobilization, adjudication and&#13;
disputeresolution, surveying, mappingand registration will bepiloted infour communities&#13;
representative o f the spectrum o f landtenure complexity insettlements identifiedfor&#13;
upgrading. Usingthe recently completed maps o fKabulbasedon satellite imagery, the&#13;
processeswill bepiloted inapproximately 5,000 plots over the first two years of the project.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The approachto be adoptedis patterned after Systematic Titling (ST) exercises&#13;
practiced internationally and which involve teams which typically includes a surveyorz2to&#13;
adjudicate and markboundaries and an adjudicatorz3who collects informatiodevidence on&#13;
rights inland.The fieldteam may also includea survey team for measuring the boundaries, or&#13;
verifyingboundaries identifiedfrom suitable mapping.The team operates systematically on a&#13;
whole district, sub-district or neighborhood basis. To be effective, ST needs to be a&#13;
transparent, participatoryprocesswhich is undertaken by field teams, operating withwell&#13;
documentedprocedures, andwith a production orientation. Inpractice a numberof field&#13;
teams are usually groupedtogether andwork withina field partythat operatesout o f a&#13;
temporary field office within the areabeingtitled. This facilitates access bythe community&#13;
andpromotes the participatoryprocess.The managero fthe fieldpartywill oversee arange o f&#13;
functions including: general management, disputeresolution, community education and&#13;
awareness (CES) andpublic notice o f adjudication decisions. Dependinguponthe situation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'*Typically  a person with technical training-a certificate or diploma - rather than a geodetic engineer.&#13;
23Not necessarily a lawyer, but typically someone with extensive experience inland administration.&#13;
Although some countries permit adjudication to be undertakenby contract or private sector staff, most&#13;
countries insist that this function be undertakenby civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the field party may alsoprovide legal support to helpthe publicprove and/or identityrights to&#13;
address issues suchas inheritance.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Internationaland local experts will be involved inthe design, initiation, monitoring&#13;
andevaluationofthe pilots andwill buildcapacity withm the localimplementingAgencies,&#13;
particularly the Afghanistan Geodesy and Cartographic Head Office (AGCHO), the recently&#13;
established specialproperty court andthe Kabul Makhzan(Registry) through the&#13;
development o fmanuals, the acquisitionof surveyingandplotting equipmentand vehicles,&#13;
the conduct o ftraining inboththe technical andproject managementprocessesas well as&#13;
hands-on engagemento f staff inthe implementationo fthe pilots. It is anticipatedthat at the&#13;
height o f the pilots, four teams will operate simultaneously. The AGCHO has indicated&#13;
adequateexisting staff capacity to be deployed for the pilot exercisesafter appropriate&#13;
training. The total estimatedcost o fthe component is $0.64 millionwith approximately two&#13;
thirds spent on international andlocal technical assistance andonethirdspent onrequired&#13;
equipment and vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements andTiming&#13;
&#13;
6.       The MUDHPMU, with assistancefiomthe TSU andthe LandTenure Consultants&#13;
will convene a LandTenure Technical Committee comprising representativesofall&#13;
stakeholder agenciesas well as others with related expertise. Participation inthis committee&#13;
will includebut notberestricted to the JudicialReformCommission, AGCHO, Supreme&#13;
Court and District Court (Makhzan) andthe Kabul Municipality. The LandTenure Technical&#13;
Committee will beresponsible for coordinatingthe inputs fromthe respective agencies and&#13;
for direction o fthe consultants engagedonthe component. The majority o fthe pilots will be&#13;
executedduringthe secondyear o fthe project, however design andinitiation o fthe processes&#13;
will begin inthe latter halfofthe first project year. A formal evaluation ofthe pilots will be&#13;
conducted inthe first quarter o fthe thirdproject year.&#13;
&#13;
AnticipatedOutputsandOutcomes&#13;
&#13;
7.       The outcome ofthe component will beviableprocesses, manuals andinstruments for&#13;
eachaspect oftenure regularization including suggestedprinciples for adjudication and&#13;
dispute resolution which maybe later embodied intopolicy or law. The exercisewill also&#13;
produce anactionplanfor scaling uptenure regularization for the rest o f Kabul including a&#13;
detailingo fthe anticipatedresources. Where the existinglegal framework is adequatefor&#13;
fully resolvingthe disputesor rectifying the irregularities discovered duringthe pilots, the&#13;
outcome will includethe actual regularizationo f the tenure so longas the affectedparties&#13;
adopt the available courseo fresolution and are able to complete it within the spano fthe&#13;
program. The buildingo fcapacity inthe Afghan Geodesy and Cartography HeadOffice&#13;
(AGCHO) will also assistthis Agency inplaying apro-active developmental role. This&#13;
initiative complements the ongoingwork to computerize and improve records management in&#13;
the Kabul Makhzanbeingsupported byUSAID as well as that Agency's interest infunding a&#13;
roll-out o f systematictitling approachesafter an appropriate methodology i s developed.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The total cost ofthis component is estimated at US$640,000. US$ 260,000 will be&#13;
financed by IDA for goods. US$370,000 will be co-financed for consultants services.&#13;

Technical Support Unit(TSU) that will consist o fa team o f specialists. The PMUand TSU&#13;
will be responsible for managing the whole project although some components (i.e. roads&#13;
programand structure planswill be co-financed andthus will also have detailed oversight by&#13;
others). The TSUwill be madeup of a core team o f specialists with wide international&#13;
experience andlocal specialists. It i s envisagedthat an international consultingfirmin&#13;
association with a local firmwill be engagedto form the TSU. Intemational specialists with&#13;
experience o f working on donor-funded projects will include amunicipal engineer with&#13;
experience o f area upgrading projects, a financial specialist with experience ofproject&#13;
accounting, a procurement specialist and a social planner/community facilitation specialist.&#13;
Each core teammember will have a localpartnerinthe TSU and the team will be supported&#13;
bytermspecialists, as mayberequiredfromtimeto time. The estimated cost ofthe TSUis&#13;
US$2,640,000. This will be co-financed.&#13;

Ministry of Interior (MOI), except for Kabul. KabulMunicipality is somewhat o f an anomaly&#13;
inthe systemwith a far greater independence thanany oftheother municipalities. Ithasthe&#13;
status o f a Ministrywhich has a number o f implications for its hctioning.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The Mayor and the top Managers are appointed by the President. The rest o f the&#13;
staff are appointed bythe Municipality(unlike other Municipalities where staff are appointed&#13;
bythe MOI).&#13;
&#13;
3.       Unlike other municipalities, the budget o f the Kabul Municipality is approved by the&#13;
Ministryo fFinance. Like other municipalities ithas independence inrevenue generation,&#13;
budgeting andplanning and expenditure control andprocurement. Systems for revenue&#13;
generation, its administration, planning, budgetingand expenditure do exist inKM. These&#13;
can be improved.&#13;
&#13;
4.       RevenueGeneration.The Kabul Municipality generates a fairly significant revenue.&#13;
In1381, it generatedapproximately US$2,5 millionfromitsseveral sources ofrevenue&#13;
including the rental tax, safiyi tax (a cleaning charge), market rental, business permissions,&#13;
imports, business tax, selling o fmunicipal property, fines, documents, entrance fees anda tax&#13;
on NGO's.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Nevertheless, several improvements are possible. First, the tax rates require review.&#13;
For example, the valuation o fproperty for the safiyi tax last occurred in 1978. The highest&#13;
charge on this tax is currently US$4. Second, tax administration is onerous. For the tax-&#13;
payer it involves several visits to several departments. Third, the KM,they have n o right o f&#13;
enforcements over non-payment. Finally, inthe absence o f national policy on municipal&#13;
taxation andrevenues, there is currently a risk o fthe KMimplementingtax policy contrary to&#13;
nationalpolicy.&#13;
&#13;
6.       PlanningandBudgetingsystems are inplace. Identification o fexpenditure needs&#13;
occurs at 3 levels. Each departments identifies its existing operations andmaintenance needs&#13;
andsubmits to Finance andPlanningDepartment its staffestimates (tashkeel) andits budget&#13;
estimates (tarsis) inthe 8" montho f the year. At the District Level, the district officers,&#13;
together with Walul's, identify needed community investments. Finally, at the municipal&#13;
level, development projects are also identified.&#13;
&#13;
7.       However, there are several problem inthis process. Departmental budget plans and&#13;
their increases are usually based on last years budget plus a top-up. Currently, Kabul is&#13;
undergoing some infrastructure development. Thls i s set to increase dramatically over the&#13;
next few years. The affected departments will have to institute a process to assist them in&#13;
projecting what additional funding will requiredfor the additional 0 &amp; Mfor the newly&#13;
constructed infrastructure. Second, the KMbudget (discussed above) does not include a&#13;
development budget. The development budget is negotiatedwith the M o F every year. It is,&#13;
however, unclear how the development needs are prioritizedby KM. Clearly, KMthus&#13;
requires a capital budget identification andprioritizationprocess.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Finally, KMdoes contain a detailed systemo fexpenditure management. However,&#13;
this is paper based and difficult to monitor. To illustrate: Salaly Expendituresare controlled&#13;
bythe salary unitwhich receives attendance sheets from all departments and districts between&#13;
the 15' and 20' o fthe month. The payroll is prepared and then submitted to the disbursement&#13;
unit(under the IncomeDepartment). Basedonapprovedpayroll, a Payment request (M16) is&#13;
prepared, followed by a visit to the Bank to get the checks issued. The checks are signed by&#13;
the Headof Disbursement andthe Head o f Income. Each department head (including district&#13;
&#13;
                                                 41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Head) gets one check each. A `Trustee' then cashesthe check, accompanied by 2 others.&#13;
These three then distribute the money to employees. Each employee payroll has their name,&#13;
grade,   serial number, basic salary, special allowances (for technical staff) and food allowance.&#13;
&#13;
9.        Consequently, the Municipalityo f Kabul will be assisted inimproving its finance&#13;
h c t i o n including revenue generation, financial management, asset management, and&#13;
budgeting andplanning. The targeted departments include the planningandfinance&#13;
department andall related sub-departments, the income department, the properties department&#13;
andthe control office. An initial assessmento fthe KMfinance function will occur, building&#13;
on existing analyses o fKabul Municipality, with recommendations on improvement. The&#13;
development of simple systems to improve efficiency will be designed and implemented&#13;
under the project.&#13;
&#13;
10.       The total size o fthe component is US$300,000 and will be co-financed.&#13;

&#13;
Issues inPlanninginAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
1.       The current Master Plan is outdated. The last plan for Kabul was a Master Plan,&#13;
prepared in 1978. Since the preparation o f that plan, the city has seen 23 years o fwar,&#13;
significant population growth andnumerous government changes&#13;
&#13;
2.       The Planningsystem is outdated. Since 1978, the planning field has made significant&#13;
changes inthe way that city plans are prepared. Master Plans are now considered in-flexible&#13;
and unrealistic. Numerous other types o fplans, such as structure plans, concept plans and&#13;
integrated development plans have thus replacedthem.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The 23 years o f war inAfghanistan andthe numerous government changes have left&#13;
behind a planningframework that has not taken into account such changes inthe field of&#13;
planning.&#13;
&#13;
4.       There is a planningvacuum. Most recently, the Master Planhas been suspended by&#13;
the Ministryo f Urban Development andHousing as a planning tool for the municipality; thus&#13;
leaving a vacuum inoperations.&#13;
&#13;
5.       There is lack o f clarity o froles andresponsibilities inplanning. The current situation&#13;
inplanningisthat the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment andHousingisresponsible for the&#13;
planningofAfghanistan's cities, andthe municipalitiesare responsible for the&#13;
implementation o f the plan. Inpractice, the roles andresponsibilities between the two are&#13;
often blurred.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Linkage between Plans and Future Proiect. There is little or no hlstory o f linking&#13;
plans to investments andbudgets.&#13;
&#13;
why do these need to be addressed&#13;
7.       Barrier to Secure Tenure. Currently, many settlements fall outside the Master Plano f&#13;
Kabulor fall withinareasnot identifiedas residential according to the Master Plan. Most&#13;
often, these areas house poor residents, IDPs andreturnees. Residents in these areas do not&#13;
have security o f tenure. One o f the barriers to grantingtenure inthese areas is that they lie in&#13;
areas not legally recognized as residential bythe Master Plan.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Barrier to the provision o f services. The lack o frecognition o fthese areas is also a&#13;
barrier to the provision o f services by the municipality.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Identification o f Vacant Land. The planwill also identify suitable vacant landfor&#13;
further housing development. f i s i s crucial to accommodate further development for IDPs&#13;
andreturnees.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Environmental Sensitivities andWater Problems. Kabul is growing at a stupendous&#13;
rate. There is daily influx into the city. However, some o fthe landinKabul is&#13;
environmentally sensitive. Furthermore, water resources inthe city are scarce. Development&#13;
inthese areaswillbedetrimental to settlers andto the environment ofKabul. The rightto&#13;
landshouldbebalanced against environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     Ad-hoc and piecemeal development. Currently inKabul, there are several piecemeal&#13;
and ad-hoc developments -many supported by donor agencies. Such a planwill help identify&#13;
where these initiatives are, what they are and what other initiatives are required andthe&#13;
required locationo f such initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.      Crisis inMUDHandMunicipalities. The vacuum inplanninghas createda crisis in&#13;
the MUDHand Municipalities, all o fwhom are unsure onwhat they should be doing. It i s&#13;
also close to creating a crisis inthe development o fKabulas it expands.&#13;

                             KabulUrbanReconstructionProject&#13;
&#13;
1.       Giventhat there are manypriorities for roads anddrains inKabulMunicipality, this&#13;
component takes a programmatic approach. It will commencewith the selection and&#13;
justification o f investments from the various lists that have beenput forward and will take&#13;
account o fthe on-going and proposed schemes (e.g. USAID supportedroad proposals as well&#13;
as the on-going Rapid RoadRepair Project). The component consists of 6 "generic" sub-&#13;
components as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         a) New Construction&#13;
         b) Reconstruction&#13;
         c) Repair and Overlay&#13;
         d) Primary Drainage ChannelsProvisionandRehabilitation&#13;
         e) SecondaryDrainConstruction andRepair&#13;
         f) Critical Traffic ManagementImprovements&#13;
&#13;
2.       The prioritization of the roads and drains to be includedunder each sub-component&#13;
will be selectedfromthe longlist ofpriorities putforward by KabulMunicipality, following&#13;
analysis andjustification by consultants (see below). With regardto the proposed traffic&#13;
managementcomponent, the report o fthe MUDHTraffic Management Advisor will be&#13;
utilized andadvice fromthe Traffic Management Unito fthe MUDH, shortly to be formed,&#13;
will be sought. AnUrbanTraffic ManagementAdvisory Group with most keyactors&#13;
representedis already inplace andmeets regularly. The Traffic Management Advisor has&#13;
produced a Traffic Management Report that should prove useful inframinga short-term&#13;
critical actions program.&#13;
&#13;
 3.      Co-financing is beingsought to fund consultants for the final prioritization, design&#13;
 and contract management, and supervision o f construction o fthe roads anddrains. Co-&#13;
 financing for execution o fthe civil works is also being sought.&#13;

11.      Community BasedOrganizations (CBO's) such as a Community DevelopmentCouncil&#13;
(CDC) or Community Action Group (CAG) representing a community ineach selectedgozar will&#13;
prioritize needed services, decide on a service standardpackage and supervise contractors. They&#13;
willbe assistedby a Planning, Designand Contracts Management (PD&amp;C) consultant.&#13;
&#13;
12.       An indicative process ofpreparation, design andimplementationi s as follows for the&#13;
preparation and design:&#13;
&#13;
(i)Appointment o f Consultants: The MUDH,assistedby the PMU and the TSUwill appoint&#13;
planning, design and contract management(PD&amp;C) Consultant`s. There will be one PD&amp;C&#13;
Consultant per district. However, one fir"G0          i s not precluded from biddingfor more than one&#13;
district. The PD &amp;C Consultant i s expected to havebothcommunity mobilization and&#13;
engineering skills and willbe most likely be procuredthoughN S or NCB.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)Communitv PlanningProcessz6.The PD &amp; C Consultant will engage with the community ina&#13;
participatory planningprocessto, amongst others, (i)       identify community priorities, (ii) on&#13;
                                                                                               decide&#13;
the level of services requiredineacharea; (iii)     participate and inputinto the planning and design&#13;
of the infrastructure. Inthe selectedcommunities where a pilot LandTenure Regularization&#13;
Programwill be undertaken (see Component B), the PD&amp; C Consultant will also assistthe&#13;
Systematic Titling Team inthis process. The followingprocessesi s suggestedfor the Community&#13;
PlanningProcess:&#13;
     0    The PD&amp; C Consultant will engage inan education campaign onthe project.&#13;
     0    The PD&amp; C Consultant will organize aneighborhoodofa few streets (approx. 150&#13;
          families) to a community meetingto select two neighborhoodrepresentatives (one male&#13;
          and one female).&#13;
     0    Neighborhoodrepresentativeswill sit onthe Community Development Council. The&#13;
          representatives will elect a Chair o fthe CDC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26 The project consideredtwo basic options for community mobilization. The first useda traditional&#13;
community consultation called the shura systemwhich consists o f appointed representatives andthe second&#13;
formed an elected CDC. Mercy Corp, an international NGO, hadusedboth a CDC system and a shura&#13;
systemwithin a single project inacross 30 gozars o f Kabul. The project assistedcommunities in&#13;
prioritizing investments to the sum o f $ 14 000 . Mercy Corp found that the community consultation&#13;
mechanism didnot affect the type o fprojects prioritized. However, the choice betweenthe shura and CDC&#13;
system involveda tradeoff betweenrepresentivity and time. The shura system didnot allow for the&#13;
participation ofwomen but took less time than the CDC system which did allow for the greater&#13;
representation o f women on the council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  The elected CDC representative will sit on an Area PlanningCommittee. The District&#13;
  Officer (DO) or hisherrepresentative will sit as amemberof this committee ina&#13;
  technical capacity -but will have no voting power.&#13;
e Neighborhoodrepresentativeswill collect priorities onprojects and preferences on&#13;
  standardswith assistance from the PD&amp; C Consultant.&#13;

&#13;
1.        The World Bankhasgained significantexperience andunderstanding o fthe financial&#13;
managementissues inAfghanistan from implementing severalprojects over the past 18 months.&#13;
The overall assessmentis that althoughthe country's financial management system is notyet&#13;
fully functional, especially to managedonor projects, appropriate general andproject-specific&#13;
mitigation measures are beingtaken for this project. These steps help to ensure fiduciary&#13;
financial accountabilityfor project funds.&#13;
&#13;
2.        Inanefforttostrengthenkeyinstitutions, theWorldBankisfinancingaFinancial&#13;

&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
3.        Through the engagement o fthe FinancialManagement Agent, the Govemment i s now in&#13;
apositionto ensureproper accounting for localpayments. Inaddition it has also put inplace&#13;
certain additional mechanisms such as the: (i)Special Disbursement Unit (SDU)under the&#13;
Treasury for disbursements and operation ofthe Afghanistan Management Information System&#13;
(AFMIS),(ii)    DevelopmentBudget and ExtemalRelations (DBER)Unitunder the Budget for&#13;
overall management and reporting o f all donor projects, and (iii)   Cash Management Unit to&#13;
undertake accounting for all income and manage cashresourcesunder the Treasury Department&#13;
of the Ministryo f Finance .&#13;
&#13;
4.        Theproposed project-specific measuresinclude the engagementof a Financial&#13;
Management Specialist as part o fthe Technical Support Unit(TSU) assisting the nationally&#13;
staffedProject Management Unit (PMU) within MUDH.This will be an important step&#13;
considering the project involves a number of agencies and consultants and it i s important that&#13;
there i s a designatedperson to ensureproper FMarrangements for these agencies. The other&#13;
measure i s the mobilization o f a Consultant Chief FinancialOfficer (CCFO), retainedunder the&#13;
ARTF-financed StrengtheningFinancial Capacity project, to support budgeting and financial&#13;
managementof the Ministryas a whole. The CCFO will work closely with the Govemment-&#13;
appointed Chief FinancialOfficerDinance Manager inthe Ministryto help strengthen its capacity&#13;
to manage itsreconstructioddevelopment program, including donor-financed projects. The&#13;
PMUwith assistance from the TSUwill develop a Project Implementation Manual with a&#13;
section on `Funds Flow andFinancialManagement' which covers procedures as well as internal&#13;
controls o f various aspects o f the overall flow of funds, the funds transfer mechanism,&#13;
disbursementto communities, and fundmanagementat the community level. Thiswill also&#13;
includethe responsibilities o f PD &amp; C Consultants with respect to compliance with transparency&#13;
rules for project expenditures. The projecthas a specific component (Part D) for undertakmg&#13;
studies and implementationfor enhancing Financial Management systems o f KabulMunicipality.&#13;
The study couldform a basis for further reformsinother municipalities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
5.       Fromthe perspective o f financial management, the main weakness inthe design of the&#13;
project i s non-involvemento f FMcapacities at the MUDH level. One reason is that FMsystems&#13;
within MUDHare still not gearedfor managing foreign grants and dealingwith donor agencies.&#13;
However to address this weakness, it i s important to involve MUDHstaff inthis project at&#13;
multiplelevels, including the PMU.This will help in improving capacity inthe lineministry.&#13;
Therefore it will be important that before the project becomes effective, MUDHnominateFM&#13;
staffwho will act as part o fthe PMU. The unit will also develop a Job Responsibilities Chart for&#13;
these FMstaff with a view to providing them with adequate exposure to complex donor-financed&#13;
project issues. This exposure will enable them to handle increasedFMresponsibilitieso f donor&#13;
projects inthe future.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Conclusion-the FMarrangements, including the systems, processes, procedures, and&#13;

&#13;
Co-financing&#13;
&#13;
7.       At the Govemment's request, the projecthasbeendesignedfor approximately 50 percent&#13;
co-financing by the government underthe Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF) to&#13;
capitalize on IDA'Sappraisal andproject implementationreview capacity. The co-financing&#13;
element i s structured around Component C, D,EandF. The Ministryof Finance has tentatively&#13;
identifiedUS$26.07 million for thispurpose.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
8.        No retroactive fundingi s envisagedunder the project.&#13;
&#13;
Systems&#13;
&#13;
9.        Theproject will rely on government systems supplementedbyproject specific&#13;
arrangementsto recordproject financial transactions inan electronic format usingsimple&#13;
spreadsheet andor database applications. Such recordingo f data shouldenable the PMUin&#13;
MUDHassistedbythe TSUto retrievefinancial informationfor producingthe Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMR) informats to be agreedwith the World Bank. These systems are&#13;
considered adequate to support the financial managementrequirements o f this project.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
 10.      Accounting Office o f MUDH,which is supervisedby Administration Department&#13;
prepares supporting documents for expenditures, payment orders(Form M16), receives approval&#13;
 fi-omController (pre-payment audit agent of MOFinMUDH)and final approval o fMinister ( or&#13;
 one o fhisdeputies or any highrank officer incase of unavailabilityof Minster and hisDeputies,&#13;
 and designatedby the Minister), and submits to the Treasury Department inMOFwhich inturn&#13;
 issues a check payable to the cash trustee by DAB after verification of supportingdocuments and&#13;
 approvals on the form. CashTrustee, receives the money from the bank, and disburses the monies&#13;
 to the intendedpayees. Currentpractice inMUDHis governmental recordingo ftransactions&#13;
basedon a chart of accounts, usinga single entry, manually maintained, cashbasis o f accounting.&#13;
 The accounting department enters these transactions inan expenditures book (Form M20), and&#13;
prepares a monthly expenditures report on form M220. MUDHreceives its operational budget&#13;
&#13;
                                                 63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
allotments on quarterly basis from MOF. MUDHhas two major category of expenditures:&#13;
payrolls andprocurements, mainly consumables.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The project will follow standardAfghan government financial managementpolicies and&#13;
procedures, including usingthe Chart of Accounts developed by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent to recordproject expenditures. Ultimately the SDUwill beresponsible for accounting for&#13;
all expenditures and receipts inthe Government's accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
12.      The MUDH's Project Management Unitwithassistancefrom the TSUwill be&#13;
responsible for coordinationwith the SDU.It will also beresponsible for coordinatingFM&#13;
activities of implementingagencies with the SDU. Considering that there will be several&#13;
agenciesand consulting organizations involved it i s important that the PMU's responsibilities,&#13;
functions, and necessaryprocedures are developed and documented ina briefset of financial&#13;
managementGuidelines as part o fthe Project ImplementationManual. These Guidelines are&#13;
expected to be sufficient to cover various aspects of project financial managementwhich the&#13;
PMU, assistedbythe TSU, will handle. The Guidelineswill lay down clear instructions onhow&#13;
different agencieswill ensure that necessaryfiduciary controls are inplace regarding&#13;
expenditures incurredby them. Iti s expected that the Guidelines will be ready within 3 months o f&#13;
the project becoming effective. The Guidelines will needto be authorized by the MOF&#13;
considering it has the overall responsibility for fiduciary compliance and also approved by IDA.&#13;
The CCFO, CFOEinance Manager, andthe FinancialManagement Specialist ofthe TSUwill&#13;
assistthe P M UinMUDHto recordproject financial transactions inan electronic format using&#13;
simple spreadsheetand/or database applications. Suchrecordingo fdata shouldenablethe PMU&#13;
inMUDHassistedbythe TSU toretrievefinancial information for producingtheFinancial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMR) informats to be agreedwith the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Annual project accounts will be consolidated centrally inthe Treasury Department,&#13;
supportedby the Financial Management Agent. Consolidated project financial statementswill be&#13;
prepared for all sources and uses of funds.&#13;
&#13;
Reportingand Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
14.      For other Bank projects Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs) are prepared centrally in&#13;
the SDU and consolidated for the donors by DBER.These FMRs do not provide the necessary&#13;
informationrelating to component-wise expenditure as well as correct category-wise breakdowns&#13;
as this detailed knowledge lies with the implementing agencies. Inthis project, FMRswill be&#13;
produced by the PMU, assistedby the TSU, which will have adequate data, staff, and systems.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Quarterly FinancialMonitoring Reports will be produced by the P M U assistedbythe&#13;
TSUshowing: (i) anduses of funds bydisbursement category and project component; (ii)&#13;
                   sources&#13;
physicalprogress; and (iii) ofprocurement activities. The FMRformat will be agreedto at&#13;
                            status&#13;
or before project negotiations. FMRs will be submitted to the DBER for consolidationand&#13;
submission to IDAwithin 45 days o fthe end o f each quarter. Annual project accounts will be&#13;
consolidated centrally inthe Treasury Department supported by the FinancialManagement&#13;
Agent. Consolidatedproject financial statements will beprepared for all sources anduses of&#13;
funds.A monthly reconciliationprocess willbe undertakenbythe PMUassistedbythe TSU&#13;
address variations between FMRsand annual financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Formats will need to be designedfor reporting on Statement o f Expenditures, Advances&#13;
on CommunityProject Funding, and subsequent payment requests. Inaddition, formats will need&#13;
to be developed for physicalprogress reportingon the process and outputs of community projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  64&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for boththe P M U(assistedby the TSU) and PD&amp;C Consultants. These formats will form a&#13;
integralpart o f the Project ImplementationManual.&#13;
&#13;
Staffingand Training&#13;
&#13;
17.      SDUinMOF, supportedbythe FinancialAgent staff, will undertakethe main&#13;
responsibility o fpreparingwithdrawal applications, tahng steps to transfedmake payments,&#13;
undertake accounting, and beresponsible for preparingfinancial statementsand SOEs to be&#13;
audited bythe Control and Audit Office (CAO supported by the Audit Agent). To strengthen the&#13;
staffing capacity o f SDU, 3 Afghan Nationals, with economic degrees and with computer and&#13;
Englishspeaking shlls, havebeenputinplace. A document entitled `Documentation Guidelines'&#13;
i s available at the SDUto facilitate this process and also to be used for training of fresh&#13;
appointees. It i s expectedthat all payment requests willbe made accordingly. The SDUwith&#13;
support from FinancialManagement Agent shouldbringto the notice o f all the implementing&#13;
agencies likely to sendpayment requests about these guidelines and, ifrequired, provide them&#13;
with necessarytraining and orientation.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     As the MUDHdoesnot have adequatecapacity for financial management, ithasbeen&#13;
agreedthat a FinancialManagement Specialist as part of the Technical Support Unit(TSU)&#13;
assisting the nationally staffed ProjectManagement Unit (PMU) withinMUHDalong with full-&#13;
time CCFO financed under the ARTF funding and counterpart manager and staff will be inplace&#13;
to oversee financial managementaspects of the project.&#13;
&#13;
 19.     To facilitate SDUcoordinationwith MUDH,the Financial Management Specialist o f the&#13;
TSUwill beincludedinany arrangementsfor project implementation. The FMS will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating among the different implementationagencies. SDUwill be&#13;
responsible for providingnecessaryorientatiodtraining. The FMS will work closely with the staff&#13;
inthe PMU, PD&amp;C Consultants, SDU, DBER,andtheWorldBank.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 20.      The accountsof the project will be auditedby the Auditor General, withthe support of&#13;
 the Audit Agent, withterms o freference satisfactory to the Association. The audit of the project&#13;
 accountswill include an assessment of the : (a) adequacyo f the accounting and internal control&#13;
 systems; (b) ability to maintainadequate documentation for transactions; and (c) eligibility of&#13;
 incurred expenditures for Association financing. The audited annual project financial statements&#13;
 will be submitted within 6 monthso fthe close o f fiscal year. All agenciesinvolved in&#13;
 implementationand holding records o f expenditures will needto retain these records as per the&#13;
 retentionrequirements inthe Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
 21.      The following audit reports will bemonitoredinthe Audit Reports Compliance System&#13;

 22.      All componentswillbe fundedeither through direct payment mode or throughpayment&#13;
 from a Special Account(SA). This special account will be opened and maintainedinDa&#13;
 Afghanistan Bank or a commercial bank situated inKabul with terms and conditions acceptable&#13;
&#13;
                                                  65&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to the association. The Authorized Allocation ofthe Special Account will not exceed $2&#13;
million. The SA, inkeepingwith current practices for other projects inAfghanistan, will be&#13;
operatedby the Special DisbursementUnit(SDU) inthe Treasury Department of Ministryo f&#13;
Finance. Requests for payments out of SA funds will be made to the SDUbythe MUDH.In&#13;
addition to payments out of SA funds, MUDHcould also request the SDUto make direct&#13;
payments to contractors and consultants, and special commitments for contracts coveredby&#13;
letters of credit. Such requests will follow the World Bankprocedures. The SA will be funded&#13;
initially basedon a payment Application request and subsequentrequestApplications for&#13;
replenishment to the Special Account will be submittedinline with arrangementsspecified in&#13;
Disbursementarrangementsbelow&#13;
&#13;
23.      Payments will bemade on the basis of approved contracts entered into byMUDHwith&#13;
Consultants, Contractors, NGOs, and Communities.&#13;
&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
24.      Theproject will be implementedthrough severalimplementingagenciesincluding&#13;
certain consultingorganizations. One o f the mainproject risks is coordinationamong these&#13;
differentagenciesand organizations to ensureproper fiduciary control over expenditures andto&#13;
receive accurateand timely reports. This risk will be mitigatedby several factors: i)appointment&#13;
o f an MUDHFMS inthe Technical Support Unit providing assistance to PMU, ii)preparation of&#13;
financial managementguidelines as part of Project ImplementationManual, iii)and nomination&#13;
o f a person from their respective organizations who will be directly responsible for coordinating&#13;
withthe PMU. Ifcertainforms andprocedures are found to be impractical andrequire&#13;
amendment, these will bereviewed duringthe periodic workshops and the requiredrevisions of&#13;
the Implementation Manual will beundertaken&#13;
&#13;
25.       With the support of internationaltechnical assistance on operations o f SWIFT and&#13;
Letters of Credit the performance o f Da Afghanistan Bank has improved significantly. Also to&#13;
mitigate the risk of payment delays, the project has the optionto locate the SA inany&#13;
commercial bank inKabul.&#13;
&#13;
26.       Within KabulMunicipality and MUDH,the lack of FMexpertise i s still a matter of&#13;
concern. It i s expectedthat with appointment o f anFMSpecialist within MUDH,along with the&#13;
CCFO(who i s already inplace) and CFO to coordinate with these ministries, andnomination of&#13;
FMstaffbythe KabulMunicipality, these risks will beaddressed to alarge extent.&#13;
&#13;
27.       With the above risks taken into consideration ,the project appearsto be highrisk,&#13;
however ifthe above mitigating measures are taken the FMrisk will be reducedto mediumThis&#13;
riskratingi s predicated on the FM, Audit, and Procurement Agents being inplaceto ensure&#13;
financial accountability for project funds.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Withanestimatedpopulationof around 25 million, Afghanistan is among the poorest&#13;
countries inthe world. The urbaninfrastructure o f Afghanistan was severely damagedinthe past&#13;
two decades of conflict. Neglect and even deliberate targeting o f vital facilities that keep modem&#13;
cities healthy and prosperous have resulted ina variety ofpublic healthproblems ina number o f&#13;
urbancentersinthe country. These problems are further compounded by the increasing numbers&#13;
of people who are moving into urbanareas to escape rural hardships insecurity arising from&#13;
degradedenvironments and loss o f livelihood as well as retumo frefugees insubstantial numbers&#13;
(nearly 3.5 millionAfghans are estimated to bereturning by the endof 2003). There i s a&#13;
tremendous shortage of housing. The proposed Afghanistan Reconstruction Project with funding&#13;
assistance from the World Bank seeks to provide much-needed support inrehabilitating and&#13;
improving services inKabul and provincial towns ofAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectObjective&#13;
&#13;
2.      The mainobjective o fthe Kabul UrbanReconstruction Project i s to improve urban&#13;
managementand the delivery o f urban services inKabul. This will be achieved by supporting the&#13;
integration of selectedneighborhoods into the urban fabric of the capital city by carrying out&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation o f urban services and enhancing the managerial capacity of the&#13;
Ministry of UrbanDevelopment and Housing and the Kabul Municipality. The project will also&#13;
lay the groundwork for a follow-up project aimedat city-wide infrastructure reconstruction and&#13;
service delivery. The project will also support improvements inwater supply andprimary road&#13;
networks inselectedsecondarytowns.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
3.       Inpursuitofthe above objective, the proposed Creditwill finance a series ofinvestments&#13;
incriticalinfrastructure anda set ofinstitutionaldevelopment activitiesdesignedto improvethe&#13;
managementcapacity o fthe Ministryo f UrbanDevelopment and Housing and the Kabul&#13;
Municipality&#13;
&#13;
Potentialimpactsofvarious components&#13;
&#13;
4.       Activities envisaged under the project should not entail significant and negative&#13;
environmental and social impacts, provided they are designed and implementedwith due&#13;
consideration of environmental and social issues. Construction activities may cause limited,&#13;
temporary, and localizednegative impacts that canbe mitigatedthrough the implementationof an&#13;
appropriate social and environmentalmanagement plan. Most infrastructure development&#13;
envisagedunder KURP should contributeto improving environmental and social conditions in&#13;
Kabul. Capacity buildingo fthe ministryand o f KabulMunicipality, which will also include&#13;
environmental and social management, are likely to have a positive impact on the environment.&#13;
The proposedpreparation o f a revisedstructure plan for Kabul and feasibility studies will include&#13;
detailed environmental and social assessments so that environmental and social concerns can be&#13;
addressedinboththe design and implementation o f future large scale projects.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
5.        Adverse impacts may arise due to depletion or degradation ofnaturalresources such as&#13;
stone, earth, water etc. used for housing and urbaninfrastructure construction and ifproper&#13;
environmentalmanagementi s not carried out at design, construction and operation stages. To&#13;
limitthe extent ofthese risks, the Frameworkprovidesguidelines andcodesofpractice for and&#13;
environmentalmitigation measuresto be incorporated inthe design, contracting and monitoring&#13;
o f investments, along with an implementationstructure assigningresponsibilities to implementing&#13;
agencies and their consultants, and acapacity buildingprogram for social and environmental&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
Purposeofthe EnvironmentalandSocialManagementFramework&#13;
&#13;
6.         Itis acknowledged that currently social andenvironmental managementinAfghanistan is&#13;
sufferingfrom critical capacity constraints. Since there i s potential for adverse impacts, albeit&#13;
limited,onthe environment dueto the proposed activitiesunderthe KabulUrbanReconstruction&#13;
Project, their mitigation and managementi s key to wholesome rehabilitation and development o f&#13;
neighborhoods. Hence, keepinginview the existing social and environmental management&#13;
capacity, as well as the flexibility requiredwith investments still to be finalized, a framework&#13;
approach i s adopted for K W . It allows the early identification ofpotential adverseimpacts,&#13;
without the requirementofrigorous analysis through quantification, and also provides broad&#13;
guidance for their effective mitigation. Consistent with existingnational legislation, the objective&#13;
of the Frameworkis to helpensure that activities underthe project will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0     Protect human health;&#13;
&#13;
     0     Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
     0     Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their&#13;
           cumulative effects;&#13;
&#13;
     0     Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
&#13;
     0     Ensurecompliance withWorldBank safeguardpolicies.&#13;

GeneralPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
7.         Recognizingthe emergency nature of proposedreconstructionoperations, and the related&#13;
need for providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence inmanaging&#13;
potential environmental and social risks, this Framework is basedon the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
0    Theproposed operations will support multiplesubprojects, the detaileddesigns ofwhichmay&#13;
     notbe known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
     policies, the Frameworkprovides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
     implementationfor the selection and design o f subprojects, and the planning of mitigation&#13;
     measures;&#13;
&#13;
0    Allproposed investments will be screenedto ensurethat the environmentaland social risks&#13;
      canbe adequately addressedthroughthe application of standardized guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
0    Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintainregional balance, and equity&#13;
     between genders, and ethnic andreligious groups, consideringvariations inpopulation&#13;

&#13;
Safeguard Screening&#13;
&#13;
8.      Although no significant environmental impacts are expected, some proposed activities&#13;
willneedto be carefully screenedfor potential impacts, including: (i)    solidwaste management,&#13;
particularly ifit involves disposal; (ii)&#13;
                                       domestic liquidwaste disposal, and septic tank cleaning;&#13;
(iii)&#13;
    reconstruction of sewers and drains; (iv) low cost water treatment facilities and water&#13;
distributionnetwork repairs and extensions inKabul and inprovincial cities; and (v) construction&#13;
impacts for accessroads.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Additionally, the selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects&#13;
will be consistent withthe following guidelines, available at the WorldBankInfoshop or at the&#13;
World Bank Office, Kabul:&#13;

&#13;
Mitigation measures-Design&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Sound design will, at least diminish, ifnot eliminate, most of the potential adverse&#13;
impacts ofproject activities. Good Engineeringdesign will, inmost cases, have a positive impact&#13;
on the environmental conditions inthe project area.&#13;
&#13;
 11.    As a matter ofprinciple, nonewborewells shouldbe drilledinurban areas as it will&#13;
further deteriorate the quantity and quality o f groundwater. It i s however recognized that piped&#13;
water will notbe madeavailable to all urbanresidents for many more years, and there i s an&#13;
urgentneedto ensureaccessto safe water for dnnkingpurposes at least.Where water cannot be&#13;
supplied through the network, the project will assess feasible alternative/temporary options on a&#13;
case-to-casebasis. If  itisdeterminedthat anewborewellisthe only possible alternative, a&#13;
through environmental assessment will be carried out, including water quality tests and analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   71&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f impact on aquifers and on other users of the resource. Inall cases, adequatewater quality&#13;
monitoring arrangementswill be putinplace.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Adverse impacts on local ecology will be consideredon a case-by-casebasis. A pre-&#13;
design walk-through of the design team, with specialist environmental input, through the project&#13;
area will be a highlydesirable exercise. Otherwise, local knowledgefrom other stakeholders such&#13;
as NGOs' and local residents may betapped to ascertainthat the project doesnot cause&#13;
significant damage to any important environmental resources.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Co-ordination with the line departments, other stakeholders such as NGOsmust beginin&#13;
the design phaseitself. This will ensurethat the project i s ready for mitigating impacts such as&#13;
those related to Resettlement and Health service support, ifrequired. One aspectwhich deserves&#13;
attention i s the drafting o f the Contract documents where social and environmentalmitigation&#13;
shouldbebuilt into the project agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigationmeasures-Construction&#13;
&#13;
14.     The emphasisofthe EnvironmentalManagement Plan(EMP) is onconstructionstage&#13;
impacts since the operation stage impacts, as has already been statedbefore, canbe minimized,&#13;
mitigated or compensatedby managing the rehabilitatedinfrastructure inline withproject design&#13;
parameters.Inorder to minimize the potential adverseimpacts of construction, standardbidding&#13;
documentswill have the followingenvironmental precautionary clauses:&#13;
&#13;
     0  The natural landscape should be preserved to the extent possible by conducting&#13;
        operations in a manners that will prevent unnecessary destruction or scarring o f natural&#13;
        surroundings. Except where requiredfor permanent works, quarries, borrow pits, staging&#13;
        and processing areas, dumps, and camps, all trees, saplings, and shrubbery should be&#13;
        protected from unnecessary damage by project related activities. After unavoidable&#13;
        damage and to restore quasi-original conditions were appropriate;&#13;
&#13;
     0   Contractor's operations should be so performed as to prevent accidental spillage of&#13;
         contaminants, debris, or other pollutants, especially into streams or underground water&#13;
        resources. Such pollutants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste, tailings,&#13;
        petroleumproducts, chemical, biocides, mineral salts, and thermalpollution.&#13;
&#13;
     0  Wastewater, including those from aggregate processing and concrete batching, must not&#13;
         enter streams without settlingponds, grade Ifilters, or other process, so as not to impair&#13;
         water quality or harmaquatic life;&#13;
&#13;
     0   The contractor should ensure proper disposal of waste materials and rubbish.Ifdisposal&#13;
        by burial or fire, it should not cause negative impact to either the air, soil nor ground&#13;
         water supplies;&#13;
&#13;
     0   The contractor should minimize air and water pollution emissions. Dust from the&#13;
         handling or transporting o f aggregates, cement, etc., should be minimized by sprinkling&#13;
         or other methods. Materials, brush or trees should only be burned when the owners&#13;
        permits, under favorable weather conditions;&#13;
&#13;
     0   The contractor's facilities, such as warehouse, labor camps, and storage areas, should be&#13;
         planned in advance to decide what the area will look like upon completion of&#13;
         construction. These facilities should be located so as to preserve the natural environment&#13;
         (such as trees and other vegetation) to the maximum extent possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  72&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     0  After project construction, camps and building should either serve as permanent&#13;
        residences and form future communities, if such use can be foreseen and approved, or be&#13;
        tom down and the area restored to its quasi-original condition in order to avoid&#13;
        deteriorationinto shanty towns.&#13;
&#13;
     0  Borrow pits should be landscaped and planted accordingly to an ecological design to&#13;
        provide some substitute area for lost naturallandscapesand habitats.&#13;
&#13;
Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
15.     The components of the project will benefit households ingeneralby providing increased&#13;
level of services includingwater, sanitation and transport. While women and childrenare not&#13;
specifically targeted, they will be the primary beneficiaries of the interventions inwater and&#13;
sanitation interms of healthgains (the under-5 mortality rate i s currently 25%) andreduced&#13;
workload inwater collection. The realizationof these benefits will be ensuredthroughthe&#13;
provision o fhealtheducation as part o fthe water and sanitation interventions.&#13;
&#13;
16.     No landacquisitionis anticipated since the project mostly involvesrehabilitation of&#13;
existingurban structures and construction inexistingmunicipal right-of-ways (for roads and&#13;
water supply). However there are three proposed investment components where there couldbe&#13;
some potential for land acquisition: urban upgrading, water supply, and roads. Inthe event that&#13;
any minor areas o f landwill be neededfor aproject (e.g. realignmento f aroad), such land could&#13;
only be obtained through either private voluntary donations, compensation payments for assets&#13;
acquired by the local community, or available government land. Privatevoluntary donations will&#13;
be documented as requiredby the Framework, as will compensationpayments madeby the&#13;
community. A one page LandAcquisition Assessment Data sheet includes basic land acquisition&#13;
screening information including, quality of landrequired, location, use of land andnumber of&#13;
people potentially affected by involuntary resettlement. For government land, documentation will&#13;
beneededthat the landis free of encroachments, squatters or other encumbrances, andhasbeen&#13;
transferred for the project by the authorities.&#13;
&#13;
 17.    No activities will be supportedthat require involuntary landacquisition or the acquisition&#13;
o f landrequiringthe resettlement or compensation ofmore than 200 people. Consequently, no&#13;
Resettlement Action Planwill berequiredfor the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     The identification of areas for upgradingwill be basedupon transparent and clearly&#13;
defined selection criteria basedupontechnical eligibility and vulnerability o fthe population to&#13;
minimize risk of ethnic inequity.&#13;
&#13;
Participation Framework&#13;
&#13;
 19.     Participationi s a processthrough which stakeholders influence and share control over&#13;
development initiatives and the decisions andresourceswhich affect them. This processwill be&#13;
carried out throughthe different stages ofproposedproject i.e. selection of investments, planning,&#13;
implementationand monitoring for which a strategy will be prepared (by the consultants&#13;
implementingthe project components, notably urbanupgrading, as part of inceptionreports),&#13;
withthe following objectives:&#13;
&#13;
a    Understand existing modes o f participation to improve the effectiveness o f stakeholder&#13;
     participation. Collaborate with govemment to identify appropriate stakeholders. Recognize&#13;
     customs, beliefs, attitudes and constraints relatedto participationare gender-specific and stem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  73&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    from the fact that men and women play different roles, have different needs, and face&#13;
    different constraints on a number of different levels.&#13;
&#13;
0   Develop a strategy for involving stakeholders as participants and monitoring and evaluating&#13;
    participation and outcomes that involves both quantitative and qualitative tracking o f&#13;
    indicators over the life of the project which i s done with the direct involvement o f the&#13;
    communitieswhose participation is beingmonitored.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Duringthe processo fconsultations withlocalcommunities, separate arrangementsshall&#13;
bemade to ensureparticipationbyand consultation with women, as they cannotbe expectedto&#13;
be covered through the general community consultations.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibilitiesfor SafeguardScreeningandMitigation&#13;
&#13;
21.     The overall responsibility ofproject oversight rests with the Ministryof Urban&#13;
Development and Housing (MUDH).A designated SafeguardsNodal Officer will be identified&#13;
withresponsibility for overseeing the implementationofthe Environmentaland Social&#13;
Safeguards Frameworkand Management Plan at the MUDH.InternationalConsultant firms will&#13;
be contracted for the implementationo fthe project investment components (urban upgrading,&#13;
water supply, androads), and will have primary responsibility as per the terms of their Contract to&#13;
ensure adequate social and environmental mitigation andmanagement duringdesign,&#13;
construction and operation, as shown below:&#13;

Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
22.     As part ofthe social and environmentalcapacity buildingthat will beprovided for&#13;
implementation ofIDA-financedoperations inAfghanistan, the SafeguardsFocal Officer and&#13;
relevant staffof MUDH,Kabul Municipality and implementingagencies/Consultants will receive&#13;
training inthe application o fthe Safeguard Framework. It i s proposedto prepare specific&#13;

&#13;
                                                 74&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
materials, hold a workshop, and arrange site visits to other countries inthe region on similar&#13;
projects inprogress to provide hands-on training to the Ministryand implementing agency staff.&#13;
Specialist training modules maybe considered after an acceptablelevel of base knowledgehas&#13;
been established. The capacity buildingactivity will be implementedunder a separate Technical&#13;
Assistance programfor Social and Environmentalmanagement. Duringsupervision o f the&#13;
project, the World Bank will assessthe implementation of the Framework, and ifrequired, will&#13;
recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
23.      This Environmentaland Social SafeguardsFrameworkwas developed onthe basis ofan&#13;
overall Framework for World Bank-fundedreconstruction operations which was preparedin&#13;
consultation with the principal NGOs and development partners participating inreconstruction&#13;
activities inAfghanistan. Prior to approval o f the project by the World BankBoard, it will be&#13;
disclosed by IRAinbothDari and Pashto, as well as English, andit will also be made available at&#13;
the World Bank's Infoshop. It i s worth noting that IRA intendsto make all project documentation&#13;
publiclyavailable throughthe Afghan InformationManagement System(AIMS).&#13;
&#13;
24.      Theproposedproject will support feasibility studies for future largeurbaninfrastructure&#13;
schemes, for which World Bank safeguardpolicies relating to consultation and disclosure will&#13;
apply, ifthey are financed by IDA. Inparticular, for environmental Category A and B&#13;
investments (as definedinWorld Bank Operational Policy 4.0 1, Environmental Assessment)&#13;
proposed for future operations, the implementingagencywill consult project-affectedgroups and&#13;
localnon-governmental organizations about the project's environmentaland social aspects, and&#13;
will take their views into account. The executing agencywill initiate suchconsultations as early&#13;
as possible, and for meaningfulconsultations, will provide relevant material ina timely manner&#13;
prior to consultation, ina form and languagethat are understandable and accessibleto the groups&#13;
being consulted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.      No activities classifiedunder Category A will be financed inthis project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               KabulUrbanReconstructionProject&#13;
&#13;
1.      The diversity of the project components means that the monitoring system developed for&#13;
each of the components, will differ.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Monitoring arrangementswill includeplans for intensive supervision byIDA to ensure&#13;
prompt solutions to implementationdifficulties. At a minimum, a full supervision missionis&#13;
neededquarterly with specialists visiting Afghanistan more frequently.Bi-annualreports&#13;
detailing progress inmeetingimplementationand development objectives (detailed inthe&#13;
procurement plan and inthis annex) will be prepared and submittedto IDA. An evaluation report&#13;
will alsobeprepared for the MidTermReview and at the close ofthe project.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Responsibility for this reportingrests with the ProgramManagement Unit, assistedby the&#13;
Technical Support Unit.The results of the monitoring will be usedto analyze and improve project&#13;
management and to inform subsequentmanagement decisions. The MTREvaluationreport will&#13;
be usedto implement changesinthe project design, ifnecessary. It,together with the Final&#13;
EvaluationReport will assist inthe preparation o fthe follow on project to be prepared for FY 06.&#13;
Tables 1,3,4,5 and 6 summarize the indicators for eachproject component and component.&#13;
These will be elaborated by the respective implementationagencies.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Monitoringand Evaluation for UrbanUpgradingand LandTenure Titling. The Urban&#13;
Upgrading and Landtenure components of the project will have the most fully developed M&amp;E&#13;
system for the project. The systemwill provide information on outcomes and out puts. (See&#13;
Table 1:M&amp;Efor UrbanUpgrading, and LandTenure).&#13;
&#13;
5.      The datarequiredwill be collected through surveys, participatorymonitoringand also&#13;
throughproject monitoring o f outputs by the PD&amp;C consultants. Datarequiredinclude, inyear&#13;
one, access to and use of services, actual and perceived security o f tenure. Inyear two, in&#13;
addition to the latter data, an attitude survey covering awarenessofreconstruction program also&#13;
measuring actual reconstruction will be required. This will be repeated inyear three.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Inadditionto the monitoringonoutcomes, the ProgramManagement Unit,assistedby&#13;
the Technical Support Unit, will also monitor outputs. This will include an overall progress&#13;
report that examines the status of community mobilization, community consultation, and&#13;
provision o f services (see Table 2 ).&#13;

            Afghanistan - Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project
            aims to improve urban management and the delivery of urban
            services in Kabul. This will be achieved by supporting the
            integration of selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric
            of the capital city through carrying out reconstruction and
            rehabilitation of urban infrastructure and enhancing the
            managerial capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development and
            Housing (MUDH) and the Kabul Municipality (KM). The benefits
            flowing from the project will be measured both in terms of
            improved services in selected neighborhoods in Kabul and
            enhanced managerial capacity of the executing agencies. In
            Kabul upwards of 250,000 people will have access to basic
            urban services at a level not seen for 23 years. At the
            institutional level, both MUDH and KM will benefit from
            technical assistance and training designed to improve
            capacity to undertake their mandatory tasks. Risks include:
            1) a deterioration in the security situation and a possible
            delay in the economic revitalization of  the country; 2)
            lack of  implementation capacity caused by many government
            staff having left or having not been exposed to modem
            technological developments; 3) logistical constraints
            including unreliable transportation, lack of accommodation
            and poor communications coupled with the security situation;
            and 4) potential tension between ethnic groups. The first
            risk is outside the scope of the project to control. The
            second and third risks are manageable with close
            supervision. The fourth risk will be mitigated through the
            unbiased selection of upgrading areas. The Credit is
            expected to be fully disbursed over a 48-month period.
