Borrower:                   Saint Lucia&#13;
Executing Agencies:         Ministry of Planning, Development and Environment&#13;
Ministry of Communications, Works and Transportation&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, Land, Fisheries and Forestry&#13;
Amount:                     Loan of US$2.65 million equivalent&#13;
Credit of SDR 1.7 million (US$2.65 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                      Loan repayment in 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years,&#13;
with level payment schedule, and interest at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable rate; and Credit repayment in 35 years, including a&#13;
grace period of 10 years, at standard IDA terms.&#13;
Project Description:  The key objectives of the project will be to assist the Government in: (a)&#13;
short-term rehabilitation of St. Lucia's hydraulic infrastructure damaged&#13;
by tropical storm "Debbie"; (b) preparing an integrated watershed&#13;
management strategy and program; and (c) strengthening institutional&#13;
capacities in environmental management and flood preparedness. The&#13;
project would mainly comprise: (a) priority river and drainage works&#13;
to restore them to operable levels; (b) technical assistance for&#13;
geomorphological surveys, improving hydrological data collection and&#13;
analysis, and slope stabilization trials; and (c) technical assistance for the&#13;
preparation of watershed management plans and pilot projects, and for&#13;
improving sector institutions.&#13;
Project Benefits:    The main project benefits will be to reduce the probability of future flood&#13;
damage and  to address long term  natural resource management&#13;
problems. The project will introduce a more coherent strategy for land&#13;
usage in selected catchments. In the short run, the project will help&#13;
restore presently weakened hydraulic infrastructure in important&#13;
agricultural areas, enabling their residents to resume disrupted&#13;
employment more fully.&#13;
Poverty Category:    While the project is not included in the program of targeted poverty&#13;
interventions, its labor intensive work program will partly offset some of&#13;
the income lost from the storm's impact.&#13;
Project Risks:       The major project risks concern its timely implementation, as some of its&#13;
rationale would be vitiated by tardy execution, as the Government lacks&#13;
experience in managing activities of this type, it is taking suitable steps&#13;
to put project management on a firm basis from the outset, and to gear&#13;
up rapidly.&#13;

SAINT LUCIA&#13;
WATERSHED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
Country Setting.&#13;
1.1    Saint Lucia is the most populous of the members of the Organization of Eastern&#13;
Caribbean States (OECS), with 158,000 current residents. In the 1980s, its real annual growth&#13;
of gross domestic product (GDP) averaged about seven percent. This strong performance was&#13;
due to sound economic management (e.g., annual fiscal savings of about ten percent of GDP in&#13;
1988-93), expansion of markets for traditional exports, in particular bananas, and increased&#13;
tourism fueled by foreign investments of over ten percent of GDP. In their wake, the social&#13;
indicators showed significant improvement. However, based on a poverty profile initiated by the&#13;
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in 1994, there are indications that pockets of poverty exist.&#13;
1.2   Saint Lucia has reasonably good prospects for sustainable growth through building on&#13;
these achievements. But its past steady growth has slowed to less than three percent during the&#13;
1990s, largely because of fundamental changes in the external environment.  Increased&#13;
competition from Latin American banana exporters has eroded the country's long standing&#13;
preferential market arrangements in Western Europe. The initiation in mid-1993 of a more&#13;
restrictive European Union (EU) banana regime also figured in the recent slippage. In addition,&#13;
concessional aid flows have declined in the nineties. Social disruptions accompanied the changes&#13;
in the banana situation during 1993-94.&#13;
1.3    These adverse developments were exacerbated by the September 1994 tropical storm&#13;
"Debbie," which caused unprecedented damage. The resulting losses are estimated to have&#13;
reduced banana income by the equivalent of seven percent of 1993 GDP. The overall damage&#13;
to the economy was tentatively calculated at 19 percent of the same. Following these, the lower&#13;
banana export proceeds coupled with increased imports required for the reconstruction program&#13;
are projected to widen the gap in external accounts in 1994-95. The Government's projections&#13;
show that real GDP will significantly decline from an annual average of three percent during the&#13;
1990s to lower growth in the short run depending upon the pace of implementation of the&#13;
reconstruction program.&#13;
1.4    The flood damage, therefore, came at a difficult moment, especially as St. Lucia is&#13;
pursuing much needed economic diversification. The economy has already been undergoing&#13;
considerable change towards reduced agricultural dependence, with tourism and export services&#13;
becoming more prominent. However, agricultural diversification has yet to yield substantial&#13;
benefits, the last few years' construction boom has largely dissipated, and manufacturing activity&#13;
has turned down. To these ends, the authorities issued a medium term economic strategy&#13;
document (developed with the Bank) in March 1994; are discussing future banana policy with the&#13;
EU, UK and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB); and are examining development options&#13;
with bilateral assistance, including a program of economic transition that would: (i) restructure&#13;
the banana industry and wean away inefficient farmers; (ii) provide temporary safety nets for the&#13;
displaced farmers; and (iii) further develop infrastructure and human resources for services-&#13;
oriented economy while improving the incentive of regulatory frameworks for broad based&#13;
growth.&#13;
1.5   Saint Lucia's topography is rugged with mountain peaks and deeply incised river&#13;
channels. Less than ten percent of the total land area occurs on slopes of less than five degrees.&#13;
Thus the great bulk of land requires some form of soil conservation. In addition, only about six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
percent of all available land is considered prime agricultural soil (Classes 1-111, U.S. Department&#13;
of Agriculture).&#13;
1.6    Agriculture contributed 20 percent of GDP in 1994, more than any other sector. In&#13;
addition, the 1991 census reflected that it occupied almost a fourth of the labor force, although&#13;
many farmers are subsistence producers who often have other income sources. Agriculture&#13;
dominates land usage too (about 55 percent of the island). The last land survey (1989) found&#13;
forests covering about 35 percent of the land, and settlements most of the balance. However,&#13;
forest clearance for cultivation has been proceeding rapidly; almost 20 percent of the land was&#13;
converted to agriculture in 1977-89.&#13;
Sectoral Issues and Government Strategy&#13;
1.7    Land Use.  This is influenced by several aspects of the country's property laws,&#13;
registration practices and by inadequate legislative and institutional capacity. The total land area&#13;
is 152,320 acres (616 square kilometers) of which 38 percent constitute total farm land. Of the&#13;
total farm land available, only 2.6 percent is of Class 1, 35 percent correspond to Class II to IV,&#13;
11 percent corresponds to forest reserve and the other 51 percent is distributed among grassland,&#13;
woodlands, rural settlements, urban, commercial, tourism and industrial uses. There are limited&#13;
flat lands, with less than ten percent of the island having slopes of less than five degrees. This&#13;
geographic configuration poses physical limitations on the availability of land to meet diverse&#13;
demands and interests.&#13;
1.8    With steep slopes occupying some two thirds of forest areas, the latter's increasing&#13;
cultivation has been worrying in its stimulation of more intensive farming. So too has the shift&#13;
towards smaller farms. Between 1973 and 1986, the number of farms grew about six percent&#13;
while the total cultivated area diminished 19 percent. Farms over 50 acres have comprised less&#13;
than one percent of the total. Conversely, 92 percent of the farms had 4 or fewer ha, and&#13;
produced about 60 percent of agricultural output.&#13;
1.9    These trends have made for a considerable mismatch between land suitability and its&#13;
actual use. The 1989 studies performed for the Forest Management Plan showed high or very&#13;
high conflict between actual and recommended land use on almost seven percent of Saint Lucia,&#13;
and moderate conflict on about 25 percent. While the overall figures are not alarming, the largest&#13;
areas in the moderate-very high conflict classes were in the agriculturally important Roseau and&#13;
Cul de Sac watersheds. Moreover, the areas in the moderate to very high conflict classes are&#13;
believed to have grown since the 1989 assessment. The Forest Management Plan calls for&#13;
numerous measures to stem this deterioration, including reforestation activities, intensified&#13;
extension services in forest buffer zones, and tighter patrolling to prevent encroachment.&#13;
1.10   The agricultural land which is intensively farmed is mainly used for monoculture of&#13;
bananas, sometimes mixed with coconuts or other tree crops. The most concentrated banana&#13;
production occurs on plantations on flat valley land and adjacent moderately sloping hills. The&#13;
growing number of small-scale producers mostly farm on steeper, higher land. This is troubling&#13;
because valley production requires the maintenance of forest cover in the upper watersheds to&#13;
reduce runoff and erosion.&#13;
I.11   Agricultural land, as well as towns and roads in valleys, have consequently become more&#13;
vulnerable to floods, river siltation and sediment flows. Over time, substantial tracts of banana&#13;
crop, soil cover and forests have been lost. Also, the sustained environmental degradation from&#13;
the increasing moves to higher slopes has decreased water retention capacity, thereby overtaxing&#13;
drainage systems. The devegetation of upland areas has caused thousands of tons of silt and&#13;
sediment to be eroded during rainy periods. Sediment clogs stream channels, causing floods that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
have weakened infrastructure. It also has clouded water and has been choking coral reefs,&#13;
reducing marine productivity and tourism attractions.&#13;
1.12   Furthermore, Saint Lucia suffers from widespread landslides and torrential rains often&#13;
exceed 150 inches yearly in the interior, causing runoff down sloping parts of catchments. Since&#13;
the latter are usually small and the slopes relatively steep, the runoff is quite high. Besides these&#13;
natural problems, Saint Lucia's agricultural development has been constrained by the overall&#13;
small land area, equally small sized farms, skewed distribution of lands (many without title) and&#13;
absentee ownership. The sector moreover has been excessively dependent on the output of&#13;
bananas, the country's most adequate crop. Their exports grew from 84,000 to 132,000 tons in&#13;
1987-92. This situation is now jeopardized with the aforementioned narrowing of preferential&#13;
banana sales arrangements. Under the EU trade regime which became effective in July 1993,&#13;
St. Lucia will continue to have access to that market for some 127,000 ton banana exports.&#13;
However, it now confronts increased competition from countries that produce bananas at lower&#13;
cost and with equal, if not better, quality. Consequently, present developments project further,&#13;
and sharper, price declines and smaller export revenues.&#13;
1.13   The Government has been trying to develop more non-traditional crops for diversifying&#13;
agriculture. These efforts, ongoing for some time, have had limited success. In part, this has&#13;
been due to banana production's preferential prices, guaranteed markets, insurance scheme and&#13;
effective payments systems. The country has also found some agricultural alternatives to be&#13;
risky, and total non-traditional export earnings averaged only US$1 million p.a. in 1987-92.&#13;
Therefore the changing circumstances require redoubling these efforts. The Government's recent&#13;
medium-term economic strategy consequently calls, among others, for increasing the capacity of&#13;
livestock and fisheries, pursuing more market-oriented diversification approaches, and upgrading&#13;
distribution and marketing facilities.&#13;
1.14   In the interim, the deteriorating banana prospects are apt to alter land use and agricultural&#13;
employment. Marginal farmers may withdraw from banana production and need other means of&#13;
livelihood. Some medium and large-scale banana farmers may gradually convert part of their&#13;
land to growing other cash crops. (Saint Lucia's valley soils, unsuitable for deep-rooting tree&#13;
crops, could be used for intensive vegetable or cut flower production.) Some large-scale banana&#13;
farmers will probably seek to increase the efficiency of their production in order to remain&#13;
competitive. Thus, there could be substantially increased demand for irrigation systems in order&#13;
to reduce drought impacts. Other requirements would probably include considerably improved&#13;
extension services, more reliable availability of fertilizers, and greater attention to fruit quality&#13;
and to timing more banana exports to meet peak European demands.&#13;
1.15   Water Use and River Management. The island's water resources are limited with no&#13;
economic prospects for increases (at present technology); groundwater supply is negligible.&#13;
Storage of supplies to meet dry season needs and accessing sediment-free water in other months&#13;
are already major problems; there is frequent rationing. Agriculture has traditionally deserved&#13;
priority in its water claims. But now with tourism and urban demands growing, it will have to&#13;
reduce its demands. The Roseau water storage reservoir is scheduled to ensure adequate supply&#13;
up to year 2025. But it will not serve the growing southern areas. Water resource management,&#13;
therefore, requires equally high priority, as do considerations of reducing crops' water demands&#13;
and irrigation. Better watershed management in Saint Lucia needs to take into account that the&#13;
rivers (which provide most water supplies) are subject to increasing demands. In practice, this&#13;
means management of the rivers so that they are kept in such shape that they can perform&#13;
optimally. For these purposes, there needs to be more effective coordination among the several&#13;
government agencies concerned with development, allocation and regulation of these resources.&#13;
The proposed project aims to advance this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.16   Lack of Adequate Information and Instrumentation. Present climatic and hydrological&#13;
data collection and analysis must be upgraded because they are inadequate for planning resource&#13;
development. One of the recent experience's lessons was the impossibility of analyzing the&#13;
flood's magnitude or measuring its impact on inland water because of the paucity of reliable data&#13;
on rainfall, river levels and stream flow. The few hydrological instruments in place did not&#13;
function while others were washed away. There are furthermore no records of any length about&#13;
discharges in any rivers, save for information limited to the Roseau area. Current data moreover&#13;
only permits speculation as to whether "Debbie"-type storms are prone to recur at average 50&#13;
year intervals or more frequently. Thus, the network of meteorological and hydrological stations&#13;
should be expanded and its equipment upgraded.&#13;
1.17   Environmental Concerns.  Environmental awareness in Saint Lucia was relatively&#13;
advanced prior to the storm.  Agriculture and tourism have been recognized to be heavily&#13;
dependent on the use of the country's limited natural resources. The Government encourages&#13;
attention to environmental issues and, out of these concerns, the authorities have been attacking&#13;
several environmental problems over the past several years, e.g., commissioning the Rodney Bay&#13;
(sewerage) and Roseau Dam, and chartering solid waste management activities (the subject of a&#13;
proposed OECS project that the Bank is now helping prepare). They likewise prepared (with&#13;
Bank support) the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), and with support from several&#13;
national and regional NGOs a Forestry Management Plan.&#13;
1.18   Slope erosion has been termed the "most visibly dramatic conservation issue in Saint&#13;
Lucia" because thousands of tons of silt and sediment are eroded in the rainy season from&#13;
deforested upland areas and carried away by enhanced runoff. The sediment clogs stream&#13;
channels causing floods and infrastructure damage, fills drainage ditches, clouds the water and&#13;
chokes coral reefs as it finally settles in the sea. Such damage depletes the coastal fisheries&#13;
dependent upon coral reefs and detracts from the diving experience so important to Saint Lucia's&#13;
tourism industry. Frequent heavy scouring of rivers and silt accumulation along with loss of&#13;
rive-edge vegetation have adverse effects on riverine life and biodiversity Water supplies are&#13;
also affected since natural storage of water in the upper watersheds is reduced by clearing and&#13;
cultivating hillsides.&#13;
1.19   Strategies to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of deforestation and cultivation&#13;
practices should be an integral element of proposed watershed management initiatives. "Debbie"&#13;
underscored the need for greater momentum in these fields. The nation was shocked into a&#13;
greater appreciation of the fragility of its environment and that past practices have posed serious&#13;
flood hazards to low-lying, heavily populated sections downstream. The storm thus confirmed&#13;
the NEAP's judgment that "...there still remains much to be done, particularly in the areas of&#13;
institutional coordination for environmental management..".  The proposed project includes&#13;
measures aimed at such requirements (para. 2.11).&#13;
1.20   Disaster Preparedness.  Hurricanes, tropical storms and depressions are the most&#13;
common and damaging natural disasters with potential for severe impacts on the country.&#13;
Hurricanes usually occur between June and November, with 80 percent of those affecting Saint&#13;
Lucia occurring between July 15 and October 1. The major causes of damage from hurricanes&#13;
are flooding from rainfall, coastal flooding, storm waves, landslides and winds. The Government&#13;
has established an Office of Disaster Preparedness (ODP) to coordinate all preparedness activities&#13;
with a national network of community groups which can be activated in response to any disaster&#13;
or emergency.&#13;
1.21   Notwithstanding the functions assigned to this office, its capacity needs to be strengthened&#13;
to minimize the impact of disasters similar to "Debbie" and to provide the population with an&#13;
effective early warning system. The vulnerability of floodplain areas to flash floods may have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
increased after "Debbie" due to destabilization of soils on slopes in areas where land slips&#13;
occurred and the silting up of river beds. Thus, preparation of flood hazard mapping in priority&#13;
watersheds would be supported under the proposed project. It would complement a landslide&#13;
hazard map currently under preparation by an OAS-funded specialist. Other aspects to be&#13;
included under the proposed project: arrangements to establish 24-hour operation of the&#13;
Meteorological Services's forecasting office and radio services when there is risk of heavy rainfall&#13;
events; improved arrangements for public warnings of the risk of flash floods in towns and&#13;
villages located in vulnerable floodplain areas; design and establishment of a system to&#13;
disseminate information regarding location of shelters throughout the island; and developing an&#13;
improved building code appropriate to the potential natural hazards that affect the country.&#13;
1.22   Institutional Aspects. While reportedly there is a substantive body of legal instruments&#13;
to deal with resource management issues, the main weakness is the lack of adequate&#13;
environmental focus and the dispersal of responsibility for administering and enforcing existing&#13;
legislation. In addition, resource management functions are not always clear cut and overlapping&#13;
of responsibilities is not uncommon.  Lack of inter-institutional coordination results in a&#13;
fragmentation of some key governmental functions such as development control, resource&#13;
protection and resource development. Presently, forests, banana crops, water supply, fisheries&#13;
and communities within a watershed are all managed by different entities working in relative&#13;
isolation from one another but significantly affecting each other's jobs.  For a sustainable&#13;
management effort to be successful, an institutional framework must be created and supported&#13;
by a multi-sectoral, inter-institutional cooperation plan.&#13;
1.23   The main institution within Government which has a role in environmental management&#13;
is the Ministry of Planning, Development and Environment (MOPDE). The Central Planning&#13;
Unit of this Ministry is made up of six sections. Even within this Ministry, several of the&#13;
Sections have varying degrees of responsibility for environmental management and resource&#13;
coordination. The Government needs to establish an institutional focal point within the Ministry&#13;
of Planning with a clearly defined and effective role in environmental planning and management.&#13;
The main functions of this focal point should be to take the lead role in developing/updating&#13;
national environmental policy, establish coordinating inter-institutional links to carry out policy&#13;
decisions and ensure consultations within and outside the Government on environmental issues.&#13;
1.24   For the proposed project, the immnediate objective would be to establish a temporary&#13;
institutional mechanism involving the existing entities that have specific sectoral responsibilities&#13;
in implementing activities under the proposed project. These entities include: the Ministry of&#13;
Communications, Works and Transport (MOCWT), and the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands,&#13;
Forestry and Fisheries (MOALFF). However, coordination and responsibility should be assigned&#13;
to the MOPDE. In addition to these entities, the Government should coordinate its efforts with&#13;
Non-Governmental Organizations and formal/informal town committees to assure public&#13;
participation.&#13;
Tropical Storm "Debbie"&#13;
1.25   The uncertainties about the future were enlarged by "Debbie," which, although the&#13;
hydrologic data is weak, clearly was one of the country's worst storms. It aggravated agricultural&#13;
areas already saturated by previous rainfall, rerouted channels, scoured banks and deposited thick&#13;
silt layers. Rivers overflowed their banks, flooding adjacent agricultural land and urban areas.&#13;
Even protected riverbanks eroded, and bridges and culverts were washed away. Heavy sediment&#13;
was deposited on the banks and in the river bed, obstructing later normal flows. There were&#13;
heavy farming losses with about half of banana production acreage affected; 20 percent was&#13;
severely damaged. Fortunately though, bananas are a resilient crop and there already are signs&#13;
of some quick recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
1.26   In addition, the Government speedily and successfully launched emergency relief&#13;
operations. About 80 percent of water supply was resumed, temporary bridges installed, roads&#13;
cleared and some river protection works begun. Debris and sediment deposits were removed&#13;
from urban areas and critical river channel sections, and drainage canals are being cleared of silt.&#13;
The completion of Roseau Dam (which Loan 3184-SLU and Credit 2120-SLU are assisting) will&#13;
be delayed but its construction has been resumed. The Overseas Development Agency (ODA)&#13;
through its Caribbean affiliate, the British Development Division in the Caribbean (BDDC) and&#13;
the Canadian International Development Association (CIDA) provided timely assistance for these&#13;
measures, which started to contain and somewhat ameliorate "Debbie's" infrastructural damage.&#13;
However, these efforts were hampered by additional rains, and further repair work had to await&#13;
the 1995 dry season.&#13;
1.27   However, notwithstanding the storm's considerable direct damage, "Debbie's" main&#13;
significance was its worsening of the already stressed environment as a consequence of the&#13;
aforementioned past inappropriate land cultivation practices (ref. paras. 1.8-1.10). One example&#13;
of the compounded effects has been the greater density after the storm of landslides in deforested&#13;
slopes than elsewhere. Second, the eroded riverbanks and areas exposed by land slides now need&#13;
to be stabilized more urgently in order to reduce further large sediment movements into rivers&#13;
during future rainy seasons. There is now considerably more transportable sediment in the&#13;
watersheds, some of which will be deposited in river and drainage channels. The attendant river&#13;
meandering that may be induced could expose bank protection works to heavier scouring.&#13;
Moreover, the storm's added pressure on natural resources will worsen damage from even much&#13;
milder future storms. Therefore, all river and drainage works will need much more maintenance&#13;
in the immediate future, especially to compensate for recent under-investment in such activities.&#13;
1.28   Last November, the Government estimated that the reconstruction program would require&#13;
some US$57 million over the next three years. It reported that only slightly more than half of&#13;
this sum had then been pledged or identified. As a result, given reduced export earnings and&#13;
smaller customs revenues, the authorities have been confronting serious fiscal constraints. The&#13;
Government deferred all capital workcs programmed for 1994-95. In the process too, social&#13;
hardships have increased, particularly among the many small farmers. Lessening this toll is the&#13;
immediate objective of the rehabilitation program which the authorities are eager to advance as&#13;
far as possible during the 1995 dry season. They particularly seek to retrain the rivers affected,&#13;
clear the blocked drainage, and remove the heavy sedimentation to bring productive activities and&#13;
the livelihood of the population back to more normal levels.&#13;
1.29   The proposed project investments address these problems. Regarding maintenance costs,&#13;
it is estimated that during the next five years, annual maintenance spending would triple the costs&#13;
of previous normal years. The incremental recurrent budget expenditures over this period are&#13;
estimated to total US$7.1 million. These annual expenditures would be included in the annual&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (para.2.33).&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
1.30   In the wake of these events, the Government fully understands that "Debbie's"&#13;
incremental effects have exacerbated the already serious issues in watershed management, and&#13;
intends to take steps to prevent further expansion of cultivation in the remaining forest areas, and&#13;
to persuade farmers to abandon their harmful practices. The Government's Forest Management&#13;
Plan aims, among other things, to expand forest reserves in the upper watersheds and water&#13;
catchment areas; reforest non-forested areas within forest reserves; strengthen the patrolling of&#13;
reserve boundaries to prevent encroachment; strengthen wildlife and applied research activities;&#13;
and strengthen the organizational structure of the Forest and Land Department. The authorities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
particularly appreciate that they lack an appropriate strategy to guide sector policies addressing:&#13;
(a)    the use and protection of somewhat depletable natural resources in sustainable&#13;
agricultural systems;&#13;
(b)    orchestrating basic changes in land uses by, and income sources of, a sizeable&#13;
part of the work force; and&#13;
(c)    focusing agricultural practices more on improved productivity rather than on&#13;
expansion of cultivated areas.&#13;
1.31   The Government has, therefore, set the following medium-term targets:&#13;
(a)    to establish development criteria and guidelines and formulate a phased watershed&#13;
management plan by approximately fall 1995;&#13;
(b)    to put an institutional framework with supporting rules in place by end 1995;&#13;
(c)    to start the first watershed management pilot project in January 1996, followed&#13;
by the initiation of the first full watershed operation;&#13;
(d)    to introduce land use and watershed regulations and complete the main works in&#13;
the first full watershed operation by end 1997; and&#13;
(e)    by the end of 2000, achieve reasonable river stabilization in the first full&#13;
watershed project, and to have introduced and enforced final sector regulations.&#13;
Lessons from General Bank Experience&#13;
1.32   Key lessons from emergency recovery-type activities have been that reconstruction by&#13;
itself is not enough: measures must be taken to reduce the risk of future disaster damage, and&#13;
to safeguard people at risk. The proposed operation would help lessen this vulnerability. It also&#13;
adapts other lessons of past Bank projects of this type, in particular the experience that "fast&#13;
track" operations, in the interests of quick responses, sometimes overlook important long run&#13;
concerns. In this connection, the proposed project would address the problems of landslide&#13;
hazards and concerns of beneficiaries. Further an Operations Evaluation review of water sector&#13;
projects over two decades was discussed in the Water Resources Management Policy Paper&#13;
(WRMPP) sent to the Board on April 30,1993. Although it found that there had been relatively&#13;
few activities in watershed management the latter was an important ingredient in the sustainability&#13;
of certain (irrigation) projects. The design of this project follows closely the recommendations&#13;
of the WRMPP.&#13;
Project Context&#13;
1.33   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Saint Lucia, part of a Bank regional OECS&#13;
assistance strategy', seeks to support the Government's economic transition program. It puts&#13;
special attention on:  (i) acceleration of private-sector led economic diversification; (ii)&#13;
restructuring the public sector for more adequate public savings; (iii) infrastructure and human&#13;
resource development, and poverty alleviation; and (iv) natural resource management.&#13;
1. The OECS CAS (SecM95-457) was discussed by the Board on May 4, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
1.34   The Bank Group assistance programs in the Caribbean are based on three pillars: (i) a&#13;
major aid coordinating role through the Bank's chairmanship of the Caribbean Group for&#13;
Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCDE); (ii) an active program of economic and sector&#13;
work to provide the analytical formulation of our programs and key documentation for the&#13;
CGCED; and (iii) a lending program to support policy dialogue and specific country priorities.&#13;
The main objective of the Bank Group's Caribbean program is to support a closer integration of&#13;
the region in the international economy. It seeks to support a dialogue on the transition faced by&#13;
the OECS countries.&#13;
1.35   The Bank Group assistance strategy for the OECS is fully integrated in the broader&#13;
Caribbean assistance program. The OECS countries receive special attention during the CGCED,&#13;
both individually in country sub-group meetings, and as a group. Regional issues are tailored&#13;
to the OECS as a group. A special characteristic of our approach in the OECS has been the sub-&#13;
regional approach of our involvement, both through lines of credit channeled through the CDB&#13;
and for specific regional projects, in view of the relatively high cost of individual operations in&#13;
such small countries. In addition, our programs have sought to maximize concessional assistance&#13;
through cofinancing.  Over time, CDB has taken over most direct lending operations in&#13;
infrastructure as well as country based policy dialogue and economic and sector work. This has&#13;
allowed the Bank to redirect resources within the region to support priority investments where&#13;
CDB's capacity is still relatively weak, such as in environment, waste management and human&#13;
resources development, and in focusing analytical work on key regional issues affecting the&#13;
region. Such activities remain closely coordinated with the CDB, however, to progressively&#13;
strengthen its capacity in those areas and provide back-up support as required. However, it&#13;
should be fully recognized that, because of its relatively small size, the CDB is unlikely to be&#13;
able to fully replace the Bank in the Caribbean; hence the programs of the two institutions have&#13;
tended to be delineated along comparative advantages, rather than progressive replacement of one&#13;
institution by the other.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.36   The proposed project fully supports the CAS, targeting the natural resource management&#13;
on which the country's future basically depends. The Government also lacks the technical&#13;
capacity to prepare and execute programs in this sector, for which the Bank's experience is seen&#13;
as instrumental. Moreover, the Bank's leadership in shaping these programs and attention to their&#13;
quality would set the proper framework for subsequent watershed and agricultural investments,&#13;
which the EU, UK and CDB have indicated they plan to provide.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin and Concept&#13;
2.1    After launching "Debbie" relief and rescue operations, the Government requested the&#13;
Bank to begin preparing a program to help restore the damaged infrastructure. It likewise&#13;
stressed the importance of the broader issues discussed in paras. 1.7-1.17: making better use of&#13;
land and water resources in order to prevent the recurrence of similar damage in the future, as&#13;
well as to advance the achievement of long-term development goals. Based on this two-fold&#13;
strategy, the Bank immediately moved to help the authorities organize the proposed project. The&#13;
initial identification mission took place in October 1994. The Government and the Bank&#13;
mobilized effective aid coordination arrangements for this effort. BDDC funded the consultants&#13;
who assisted with project preparation. The Organization of American States (OAS) furnished a&#13;
landslide hazards expert for this purpose as well. These tasks were completed in December 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
And on January 11, 1995 IDA approved a PPF of US$1.0 million to initiate timely&#13;
implementation of priority rehabilitation civil works.&#13;
2.2   It should be noted that the proposed project has modest objectives regarding the inherent&#13;
problems. It is not designed to provide complete or optimal protection against the possible&#13;
recurrence of severe floods. Such protection can only emerge from possible future investments,&#13;
whose plans and pilot operations this project is intended to make available.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
2.3    The proposed project will support three main objectives: (i) to initiate the immediate&#13;
rehabilitation of the hydraulic infrastructure of priority watersheds from the damage caused by&#13;
the flooding and landslides. These works are intended to reduce the danger to livelihoods and&#13;
property. from future flooding; (ii) to address the medium and long term requirements for&#13;
sustainable watershed development by preparing a Watershed Management Plan which would&#13;
serve as the basis for more integrated, conservation-minded development of key watersheds; and&#13;
(iii) to strengthen the Government's capacities in environmental management and flood&#13;
preparedness. In reaching these objectives the Government will seek the direct participation of&#13;
the population in the project's activities and also attempt to build greater local capacitv for Saint&#13;
Lucian professionals to engage in them.&#13;
C Project Description&#13;
2.4    To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project will finance a two-year program&#13;
consisting of the activities summarized below. Total estimated project cost is US$7.1 million.&#13;
(a)    Execution of priority river and drainage rehabilitation works, together with&#13;
supervisory engineering services for their implementation. Surveys to develop&#13;
criteria for future design of improved river wvrks and for hazard rnapping; trials&#13;
of methods for arresting soil movements; and the installation of modernized&#13;
equipment and related training for improved hydrological data collection and&#13;
analysis;&#13;
(b)    Preparation of a plan for integrated watershed development, pilot watershed&#13;
management projects, and of an institutional development program consistent&#13;
with the National Environmental Action Plan fbr implementing these plans and&#13;
projects; and&#13;
(c)    Design of measures for advancing national enviromnental development and&#13;
disaster preparedness.&#13;
Rehabilitation Works (Base Costs US$4.98 million)&#13;
2.5    This component will deal with the most pressing rehabilitation problems and start&#13;
enhanced maintenance of Saint Lucia's flood control and drainage infrastructure by carrying out&#13;
priority works during the 1995 dry season. These are identified as river works, with some river&#13;
works, with some drainage works, to remove obstructions caused by TSD which could endanger&#13;
agriculture, infrastructure and livelihoods in the following wet season. These works will largely&#13;
consist of removing boulders and debris deposited in the river beds, desilting their channels,&#13;
resectioning river beds to permit safe passage of discharges, and restoring existing or applying&#13;
new river training and bank protection works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
2.6    These will be mainly repair works requiring designs to ensure that they are hydraulically&#13;
sound, and that they do not prejudice future riverine management. Appraisal indicated that their&#13;
design for the most part should be sufficiently straightforward to be completed rapidly. MOCWT&#13;
would be responsible for implementing this component. The works will be supervised on a&#13;
design-supervision basis by consulting engineers. The project provides funding for these services&#13;
to support MOCWT to ensure appropriate designs for the river works and that they are justified&#13;
in social, environmental and financial terms. All the river works will require consultants' review&#13;
of their design, respective environmental analysis and proposed mitigation measures prior to&#13;
initiation. About 27 person-months of domestic and international consultant services are provided&#13;
under this component. Terms of reference for a Resident Engineer and River Engineering&#13;
Advisor/Hydrologist have been prepared by MOCWT and approved by the Bank (Annex 2). The&#13;
project will also gather technical data through the surveys described below, which will be drawn&#13;
for the 1996 resectioning and river bank and bed stabilization works.&#13;
2.7    The priority rehabilitation works have been identified by MOCWT and MOAFF and&#13;
selected based on priority for protecting life and property and extent of damage. These works&#13;
were launched early in 1995 and will continue throughout the year in 11 priority watersheds&#13;
(attached map No.26778). The urgency of these works will require a significant effort to&#13;
complete most of the civil works before the start of the 1995 wet season. This will ensure that&#13;
the objective of protecting life and property is secured. It is estimated that about 75 percent of&#13;
the civil works will be completed by end July 1995. The remaining works will continue into the&#13;
wet season and would be completed by end March 1996. Further surveys may show the need&#13;
to concentrate some project activity in other areas as well, according to criteria agreed at&#13;
negotiations (para. 4.1 (a)). In addition, provisions will be made for special 1996 maintenance&#13;
because "Debbie"-generated sedimentation will continue for at least another year.&#13;
Watershed Management Plan and Disaster Preparedness (Base Cost US$1.10 million)&#13;
2.8    This component comprises the studies and institutional support needed for revamping the&#13;
management of priority watersheds over the next five years. The studies will identify and design&#13;
structural measures such as river training, bank stabilization, and reforestation of steep land.&#13;
Non-structural aspects to be considered would be: land use regulations, incentives, building&#13;
codes and public participation.  Implementation of the structural measures studied by the&#13;
component would be financed by other donors during a follow on phase not included in this&#13;
project.&#13;
2.9    The studies leading to the preparation of the proposed Watershed Management Plan will&#13;
include: (i) review of existing plans, strategies and legislation to consolidate and rationalize this&#13;
material in a post TSD context; (ii) collection of hydrological and geomorphological data, and&#13;
its analysis to derive criteria for the design of river works and to produce hazard maps; (iii)&#13;
developing disaster forecasting and warning systems; (iv) reviewing relevant agricultural, social,&#13;
economic, environmental, land tenure and institutional issues to propose strategies and develop&#13;
criteria for conservation methods, project selection and public participation; and (v) assessing&#13;
implementation procedures, maintenance provisions and institutional arrangements to produce&#13;
guidelines for project preparation. In addition, under the component the following activities will&#13;
be carried out: (a) surveys of rivers to establish permanent benchmarks and their coordinates&#13;
along key rivers; (b) landslide surveys with mapping sufficiently detailed for the later preparation&#13;
of hazard maps; (c) trials of hydromet operations; and (d) pilot slope stabilization measures,&#13;
testing geosynthetics vs. other materials.&#13;
2.10   The final product of this component will be a phased watershed and environmental&#13;
management plan for the medium (to the year 2000) and longer term. The plan will contain&#13;
recommendations for projects (including a pilot project) for watershed conservation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
management, land use zoning and legislation and institutional development and strengthening.&#13;
The pilot project will examine methods of river stabilization, bank strengthening, river training,&#13;
cultivation of steep land, and stabilization of upper slopes and landslide areas. Supplementing&#13;
these activities will be the design and testing of land use regulations, incentives and codes&#13;
governing construction.&#13;
2.11   There also will be undertaken an assessment of how to better coordinate Government and&#13;
non-government agencies' activities in watershed management. In this connection, an important&#13;
aspect of the component will be advancing the more participatory involvement of Saint Lucians&#13;
directly concerned with these developments. Although the Government responded swiftly and&#13;
energetically to ease the social problems which "Debbie" created, it could still deal with citizens'&#13;
concerns in a more planned, organized manner. It recognizes that the future changes in a revised&#13;
watershed management plan will depend on altering peoples' attitudes and traditional land use&#13;
practices. Therefore, under this component, the project will include a Participation Program&#13;
(Annex 2) which will provide for surveying stakeholders' opinions, and the establishment of&#13;
consultative and informational activities to involve them in the design and execution of watershed&#13;
area changes.  Such consultation requirements will also be included in the plans for the&#13;
rehabilitation works and slope stabilization trials.&#13;
2.12   TSD  also showed that Saint Lucia was unprepared to deal with such events&#13;
notwithstanding the frequency of tropical storms. There need to be around-the-clock forecasting&#13;
and public warning systems. Also, flood proofing of buildings in vulnerable areas has not been&#13;
fully explored. The authorities thus see this occasion as an appropriate opportunity to examine&#13;
more adequate preparedness and preventive systems. Specialized consulting services will be&#13;
provided, therefore, to review existing climatic and hydrological monitoring, flood and storm&#13;
forecasting. Should the consultant find that equipment and/or training are needed to strengthen&#13;
the Government's technical capacity, that individual will also assist in arrangements for their&#13;
procurement. In addition, the consultant will help the Government consider the use of codes&#13;
which enhance flood-resistant and earthquake-proof building designs.&#13;
2.13   While the public administration includes well qualified technical and managerial staff,&#13;
they are too few in number to discharge fully the responsibilities of such large scale programs&#13;
as the watershed and environmental management endeavor proposed. To address this problem&#13;
and to develop local consultancy capacity the proposed project will finance a study to assess the&#13;
local consulting capabilities, explore OECS business and Government demand for such skills, and&#13;
define an action plan.&#13;
2.14   Some 40 person-months of consultant services will be employed for this component.&#13;
Draft terms of reference have been prepared (Annex 3) and will be discussed and agreed during&#13;
negotiations. It also will entail the purchase of computer and specialized equipment such as&#13;
hydromet instruments to be installed in 17 river catchments and vehicles for the teams expected&#13;
to carry out the several studies and other assignments.&#13;
D. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.15   An Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been established under the chairmanship of&#13;
the Permanent Secretary of MOPDE to provide direction of project implementation. It includes&#13;
representatives of MOCWT and of MOALFF's Engineering Services Division (AESD)&#13;
responsible respectively for the civil works, and for the drainage and watershed management&#13;
planning operations. This inter-ministerial committee meets biweekly to review implementation&#13;
performance and resolve project problems. The MOPDE will act as overall coordinator for the&#13;
project and will be responsible for managing the project's accounts. In addition, it will be&#13;
responsible for the activities regarding environmental policy, disaster preparedness, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
studies of improved sector coordination framework and expanded domestic consultant capacity.&#13;
It also will provide advice on the activities relating to any possible resettlement of affected&#13;
populations and their more systematic participation in project operations. To this effect, MOPDE&#13;
has already established a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which includes a project manager, a&#13;
chief accountant and a procurement officer. This staffing will be maintained throughout the&#13;
project (para. 4.1 (b)).&#13;
2.16   The Rehabilitation Works component will be implemented by MOCTW. For this purpose&#13;
a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has already been established under the direction of&#13;
MOCWT's Chief Engineer, and is overseeing implementation of priority works financed under&#13;
the PPF advance. The PIU includes a design/supervision team comprising of a consultant&#13;
element: a resident engineer, a river engineering adviser, and a local counterpart team consisting&#13;
of a civil engineer and two works supervisors. The PIU is responsible for the procurement and&#13;
contracting of all civil works. Under the project it will coordinate with MOALFF in the&#13;
preparation of the Watershed Management Plan and in the implementation of the Participation&#13;
Program.&#13;
2.17   The Watershed Management Plan component will be the responsibility of the PIU&#13;
established for this purpose in the MOALFF under the direction of the Senior Agriculture&#13;
Engineer. The PIU staff will consist of a multi disciplinary team from a consulting firm which&#13;
will include: a Water Resources Planner, a Geomorphologist/Geotechnical Engineer, a River&#13;
Engineer/Hydrologist, an Environmentalist and Resettlement Specialist. Draft terms of reference&#13;
(Annex 2) for the specialists of the two main tasks ("design and supervision" of the rehabilitation&#13;
works, and the watershed management planning) have been prepared by the Government and&#13;
approved by the Bank.&#13;
E. Costs and Financing&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.18   Total baseline project costs have been estimated at US$6.1 million.   Physical&#13;
contingencies (US$0.68 million equivalent), at 15 percent on the rehabilitation works of total&#13;
baseline costs, and price contingencies (US$0.30 million equivalent) represent 5 percent of project&#13;
total baseline cost, and are based on the following assumptions: (i) a local inflation rate of 3.6&#13;
percent in 1995, and 3.0 percent per year thereafter; and (ii) prices increases for foreign costs,&#13;
estimated in US dollars, of 3.3 percent in 1995 and 2.7 percent for the remaining two years of&#13;
project execution. Cost calculations assume a nominal, constant exchange rate of EC $2.7 to&#13;
US$1 for the two-year project execution period. Project costs, including the activities financed&#13;
under the US$1.0 million PPF Advance, are detailed in Table 1.&#13;

Proposed Financing&#13;
2.19    A  Bank loan of US$2.65 million equivalent and an IDA  Credit of SDR  1.7 million&#13;
(US$2.65 million equivalent) will finance 75 percent of total project costs, net of taxes and&#13;
duties.   The  combined  IBRD/IDA  financing  will cover 92  percent of foreign  exchange&#13;
expenditures and 39 percent of local costs. The relatively high proportion of Bank Group&#13;
financing is justified by the "emergency" character of the civil works (the most costly component)&#13;
and the heavy burden of the "Debbie" reconstruction expenses on Government finances over the&#13;
next several years. Further, Saint Lucia's small economy and large dependence on imports make&#13;
for relatively high foreign exchange proportions of total costs. The Government will finance&#13;
US$1.3 million equivalent to 18 percent of total project cost. The BDDC has agreed with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
Government to co-finance engineering services for the rehabilitation works, entailing US$0.5&#13;
million or seven percent of total projects. Table 2 proviles a summary of the project financing&#13;
plan. At negotiations, Government assurances were obtained that as a condition of effectiveness&#13;
the Government will submit confirmation that adequate funding has been included in the 1996&#13;
budget for the first year's counterpart requirements, and that it has deposited in a project account&#13;
an amount estimated to cover the first four months of implementation costs (para 4.2).&#13;
2.20   Retroactive financing of up to US$0.79 million equivalent (15 percent of the Loan/Credit)&#13;
will be permitted for civil works-related expenditures incurred after January 1, 1995 up through&#13;
the date of signing of the Loan and Credit. This exception to the standard limits albeit less than&#13;
the 20 percent authorized for emergency recovery operations is considered justified to facilitate&#13;
the prompt execution of the time-sensitive rehabilitation activities (para. 4.1 (c)).&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
2.21   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that the procurement&#13;
of works, goods and services will be carried out in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines&#13;
(January 1995) and the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants By World Bank Borrowers (August&#13;
1981).  Also at the time of negotiations, agreement was reached on the use of standard&#13;
procurement documents for national competitive bidding (NCB), acceptable to the Bank (4.1 (d)).&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
2.22   Civil works to be procured with project financing (expected. to total US$5.3 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies) consists of infrastructure rehabilitation and repair and of&#13;
clean up works (mainly desilting) of rivers and streams. Works will be small in size and located&#13;
in 11 different watersheds. Grouping of contracts for priority works has been done according&#13;
to the type of rehabilitation work. About 75 percent of the planned 20 contracts are estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$100,000. Thus, it is unlikely that they would attract foreign firms. The&#13;
project appraisal concluded that local works contractors have adequate capacity to fulfill the&#13;
project tasks, and that small contracts with these firms will be the most efficient method of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.23   At the same time, the appraisal found that implementing agencies have limited experience&#13;
in carrying out the most demanding procurement procedures. Their methods may thus be&#13;
inadequate to ensure the most efficient acquisition, especially of the civil works. Steps have,&#13;
therefore, been taken to try to avert possible problems in this project. MOCWT's implementation&#13;
unit responsible for the civil works is being supported and advised by a well known international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
engineering firm (financed by the UK), which has performed satisfactorily in this role on other&#13;
projects in Saint Lucia. One of their staff, serving effectively as the "resident engineer", handles&#13;
letting the contracts, supervising them  and their accounting.  A second team member, an&#13;
experienced river engineer, supervises the hydraulic design of river works and approves site&#13;
designs. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that both the consulting engineer and the river&#13;
engineer have been employed under terms and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.1&#13;
(e)).&#13;
2.24   Because of the urgency of some works (para. 2.7), it was also agreed that civil works&#13;
which are required to respond to the immediate danger of future flooding that threatens lives and&#13;
property, and aggregating to an amount equivalent to US$1,302,000, may be procured by direct&#13;
contracting which may be awarded on the basis of lump sum, fixed price contracts based on an&#13;
hourly rate established in accordance with the list of prevailing rates utilized by MOCWT for&#13;
equipment rental, or on the basis of contracts entered into on an hourly rate based on official&#13;
hourly rates. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more per contract,&#13;
but less than the equivalent of US$400,000 per contract, may be procured on the basis of national&#13;
competitive bidding procedures (in accordance with paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Procurement&#13;
Guidelines) using standard bidding documents satisfactory to the Bank. All designs and bidding&#13;
documents for rehabilitation works will require review by the project's Resident Engineer prior&#13;
to the initiation of such works (para.2.6). The Resident Engineer will also be required to present&#13;
certification that the work was satisfactorily completed and that the procurement procedures&#13;
specified in the legal agreements were followed in the selection of contractors.  Such&#13;
documentation would be maintained for review by IBRD/IDA supervision missions (para. 4.1&#13;
(e)).&#13;
Equipment, Vehicles and Materials for Civil Works&#13;
2.25   Specialized hydromet equipment (rain gauges and rainfall recorders) expected to cost&#13;
US$200,000 (including contingencies) will be awarded on the basis of Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB) in view of the small number of potential suppliers. Purchase of four vehicles for&#13;
project units expected to cost US$67,000 (including contingencies) will be procured through&#13;
international shopping procedures, among manufacturers with established dealerships with repair&#13;
facilities (and/or spare parts inventories) in Saint Lucia. Gabion baskets for civil works up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$400,00 (including contingencies) may be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures. Stones for civil works, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$400,000 may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
national shopping procedures. The Bank's standard bidding documents for goods will be used&#13;
for procurement of hydromet equipment and gabion baskets under LIB.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
2.26   Technical assistance (expected to total US$1.6 million) for engineering services,&#13;
watershed management planning and the disaster preparedness study will be procured according&#13;
to Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. For contracts with consulting firms or NGOs not&#13;
involving assignments of critical nature, costing less than US$50,000 and contracts with&#13;
individual consultants below US$25,000, the Bank will require prior review of the terms of&#13;
reference only. Contracts with values higher than these amounts will be subject to the Bank's&#13;
prior review.&#13;
2.27   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the project engineer will: (i) certify&#13;
that the bidding procedure and bid evaluation are consistent with IBRD guidelines; and (ii) report&#13;
independently to the Planning Ministry and the Bank on implementation progress (particularly its&#13;
quality) bimonthly until August 1995, and quarterly thereafter (para. 4.01 (e)). As an additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
measure to help overcome the inexperience of the implementing agencies, arrangements have&#13;
been made to have the MOCWT and AESD staff participate in the Bank's "project launch"&#13;
workshop for the recently approved Basic Education Reform Project, scheduled for this spring.&#13;
2.28   Prior review by the Bank/IDA will apply to LIB, and to the first two NCB procurement&#13;
of works, independent of value. The following table shows proposed procurement arrangements:&#13;

G. Disbursements&#13;
2.29   The proposed Loan and Credit operation will be disbursed over a two year period. It is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 31,1996 and closed by June 30, 1997. Table 4 shows&#13;
the disbursement forecast for the Loan and Credit, by semester and by financier. A Special&#13;
Account, with an Authorized Allocation of US$0.5 million, will be set up in a commercial bank&#13;
of Saint Lucia to facilitate project disbursements, however, the initial deposit will be limited to&#13;
US$250,000 until disbursements have reached US$2.6 million. The proceeds of the Credit and&#13;
Loan would be disbursed as follows: (a) civil works, 75 percent of total expenditures; (b) goods&#13;
and equipment, 100 percent of foreign expenditures for imported goods, 100 percent of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 75 percent of other items procured locally; technical assistance:&#13;
100 percent of consultant services. Retroactive financing of up to US$0.79 million equivalent&#13;
will be provided to help cover civil works-related expenditures incurred after January 1, 1995.&#13;
Disbursement is expected to commence immnediately at Loan and Credit effectiveness with&#13;
disbursement for retroactive financing and the initial disbursement into the project Special&#13;
Account. The Special Account will be managed by the Project Coordinating Unit of the MOPDE&#13;
with all disbursement made under the authorized signatures of the MOPDE and in accordance&#13;
with Bank policies and procedures.&#13;
2.30   Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) certified by MOPDE's PCU will be furnished for&#13;
expenditures made for goods, works and consultants' services costing less than the equivalent of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
(i) US$25,000 in the case of goods; (ii) $250,000 in the case of works (other than the first two&#13;
contracts which will require prior review); (iii) US$50,000 in the case of consulting firms'&#13;
services; and US$25,000 in the case of individual consultants' services.   Supporting&#13;
documentation for these latter expenditures will be retained by the PCU, and be readily available&#13;
for review by Bank and IDA supervision missions.&#13;

H. Accounting and Audit&#13;
2.31   The country's financial management system is highly centralized, with the Minister of&#13;
Finance responsible for general financial control over the entire executive branch.  Under&#13;
Cr./2676-SLU/Ln.3837-SLU the existing financial system in the executive branch will be&#13;
strengthened in the areas of accounting, budgeting and planning and debt management. This will&#13;
include staff training in auditing and the establishment of computerized systems. Although the&#13;
Government Audit Department has the required independence to meet audit requirements, it was&#13;
agreed at negotiations that independent auditors will be used for this project until this Department&#13;
can be adequately strengthened.&#13;
2.32   Each of the Ministries participating in the project (MOPDE, MOALFF, and MOCWT)&#13;
will set up separate project accounts and each PIU will prepare monthly statements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
expenditures. The MOPDE will be responsible for preparing and submitting disbursement&#13;
applications for the entire project expenditures. Annual audit of all project accounts, including&#13;
the Special Account, will be undertaken by an independent auditor.  Audit reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank and Association not later than four months after the end of each of the&#13;
Borrower's fiscal year (March 31) under TORs satisfactory to the Bank and IDA. Assurances&#13;
in this regard were obtained at negotiations (para. 4.1 (f)).&#13;
I. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.33   The MOPDE will have overall responsibility for Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E), however, each of the PIU will be responsible for M&amp;E of their respective component&#13;
and will report their progress to the MOPDE. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
consolidated progress reports will be prepared by MOPDE's PCU and submitted to the Bank and&#13;
IDA every six months (September 30 and March 31). The March 31 report will include detailed&#13;
work program, implementation schedule and budget estimate for the following year.  At&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached on the above and on the performance indicators and targets&#13;
to be included in the Project Implementation Plan (para. 4.1 (g) (h)).&#13;
2.34   After the project is completed MOPDE will prepare an Implementation Completion&#13;
Report to be submitted to the Bank within six months thereafter.&#13;
J. Environmnental Impact&#13;
2.35   The rehabilitation works are not expected to have significant sustained negative&#13;
environmental effects, particularly as these investments are for rehabilitating existing&#13;
infrastructure.  The project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.  Some&#13;
temporary impacts, however, have been identified (e.g., transitional increases in river sediment&#13;
loads until desilting is completed). Provisions will therefore be made for appropriate project&#13;
construction safeguards to minimize their adverse effects.  Project specific environmental&#13;
guidelines acceptable to the Bank will be used by the Borrower to identify and address potential&#13;
problems.   The project consulting engineers will be responsible for ensuring that an&#13;
environmental analysis is carried out as part of the design of all civil works, and that&#13;
recommended mitigatory measures are enforced during works execution (para. 2.6).&#13;
2.36   In addition, the project should have far reaching positive effects such as preventing&#13;
further loss of land and affording greater security from river movements and erosion than&#13;
residents now enjoy. Further, the watershed management plans will address the adverse effects&#13;
of current deforestation and cultivation practices in the priority agricultural areas. In tandem with&#13;
these, the consultants engaged to prepare these plans will also recommend amendments to existing&#13;
laws and regulations to achieve more sustainable watershed management in the country. They&#13;
will also be charged with proposing actions to rationalize institutional arrangements for&#13;
environmental coordination in Saint Lucia. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that&#13;
the Government will review with the Bank by July 30, 1996 the consultants' recommendations&#13;
for legislative and institutional changes to implement the watershed management plan, and&#13;
subsequently take agreed actions resulting from this review (para. 4.1 (i)).&#13;
2.37   The project's appraisal determined that it is unlikely the rehabilitation works would lead&#13;
to any voluntary or involuntary movement of affected residents from  their areas.  The&#13;
Government recruited two OAS consultants in mid 1995 to carry out a quick assessment of the&#13;
six most vulnerable storm-affected areas where potential safety risks due to previous Debbie&#13;
damage may exist (such as weakened house foundations and landslide hazard) to determine&#13;
actions required to preserve the physical well being of families residing in these areas and of the&#13;
integrity of their housing facilities. The Government will inform IDA and the Bank in case that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
the quick assessment reveals re.ocation of any number of residents would be necessary, and&#13;
indicates the proposed solutions and informed consent of the affected people. Agreement in this&#13;
regard was reached during negotiations (para. 4.01 (j)). In addition, the Government recognizes&#13;
that future watershed management changes may entail the relocation of some area residents.&#13;
Which areas will be affected and how many households might require relocation will be&#13;
determined by the Watershed Management Plan to be prepared under the project. Based on the&#13;
recommendations of the Plan, it will be necessary for the Government to develop an appropriate&#13;
resettlement policy well in advance. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the&#13;
Government will define and promulgate by July 30, 1996, an appropriate resettlement policy to&#13;
support its watershed management plan (para. 4.1 (j)).&#13;
3. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
3.1    The project will help lessen the probability of further severe flood damage and maintain&#13;
Saint Lucia's natural resource base. It will also enhance St. Lucia's capability to react to future&#13;
severe flooding by preparing valuable monitoring systems and strengthening the institutions&#13;
involved, and by developing measures to lessen the causes of flooding (e.g., landslides).&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
3.2    The project can not provide assurance of lasting flood protection unless the land use&#13;
practice of the rural population is permanently altered. The proposed Watershed Management&#13;
Plan to be prepared under the project will address this issue and recommend solutions. In the&#13;
conduct of the project, there are two main risks: (a) time and cost overruns could result from&#13;
natural climatic conditions affecting project works; or (b) inadequate management and control of&#13;
the project because of limited technical experience of the government in operations of this kind.&#13;
Accordingly, the civil works component will consist of short-term, proven operations in order&#13;
to avert unduly complicated, lengthy undertakings. In addition, the division of responsibilities&#13;
between the Works and Agriculture Ministries and the steps taken to put expert consultants in&#13;
place should facilitate effective project execution. The availability of the PPF advance for&#13;
gearing the Government up to the task early on should likewise contribute to lessening these&#13;
difficulties.&#13;
4. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. Agreements Reached&#13;
4.1    During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the following:&#13;
(a)    criteria for selecting civil works in areas other than priority watersheds will&#13;
consider aspects such as:  protection of life and property, maintenance of&#13;
agricultural food production, effect on land use and overall impact on the national&#13;
economy (para. 2.7);&#13;
(b)   the Borrower will maintain the PCU staffed at all times with at least a project&#13;
manager, an accountant to manage the Project Account and the Special Account&#13;
and a procurement officer (para. 2.15);&#13;
(c)    retroactive financing of up to US$0.79 million equivalent (15 percent of the&#13;
Loan/Credit) will be permitted for civil works-related expenditures incurred after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
January 1, 1995 if the PPF advance results insufficient to finance priority civil&#13;
works up through the date of signing of the Loan and Credit (para. 2.20);&#13;
(d)    the procurement of works, goods and services will be carried out in accordance&#13;
with Bank Procurement Guidelines, and that standard national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) documents, acceptable to the Bank will be used (para. 2.21);&#13;
(e)    the Borrower will have the consulting resident engineer employed to assist in&#13;
execution of the civil works component: (i) certify that the bidding and bid&#13;
evaluation procedures used in the rehabilitation works were consistent with&#13;
Bank/IDA Guidelines and that the work was satisfactorily completed; and (ii)&#13;
report independently to the Planning Ministry and the Bank on implementation&#13;
progress bimonthly until August 1995, and quarterly thereafter.  Both the&#13;
consulting engineer and the river engineer will be employed under terms and&#13;
conditions and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.23, 2.24 and 2.27);&#13;
(f)    that the project's accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor,&#13;
and that audit reports will be submitted to the Bank and IDA no later that four&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 2.32);&#13;
(g)    that consolidated progress reports will be submitted to the Bank and IDA every&#13;
six months (September 30 and March 31) and that the March 31 report will&#13;
include detailed work program, implementation schedule and budget estimate for&#13;
the following year (para. 2.33);&#13;
(h)    the performance  indicators and  targets to be included  in the project&#13;
implementation plan (2.33);&#13;
(i)    that the Government will review with the Bank by July 30, 1996 the consultants'&#13;
proposed legislative and institutional changes for improved watershed&#13;
management, and subsequently take agreed actions resulting from this review&#13;
(para. 2.36); and&#13;
(j)    that the Government will advise the Bank in cases where relocation would occur&#13;
and will define and issue by July 30, 1996 an appropriate resettlement policy if&#13;
necessary to support its Watershed Management Plan (para. 2.37);&#13;
4.2    Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that prior to Loan and Credit&#13;
Effectiveness the Government submit confirmation that adequate funding has been included in the&#13;
1996 budget for the first year's counterpart requirements, and that it has deposited in a project&#13;
account an amount estimated to cover the first four months implementation costs (para. 2.19).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
4.3    Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project will be suitable for&#13;
a Bank loan of US$2.65 million equivalent and a Credit of SDR 1.7 million (US$2.65 million&#13;
equivalent) to Saint Lucia.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PRIORITY CIVIL WORKS&#13;
1.   PREAMBLE&#13;
Tropical Storm Debbie (TSD) passed over St. Lucia during the early hours of&#13;
September 1 0, 1 994, causing extensive damage to the country. Continuous intensive&#13;
rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, massive landslides, sediment transportation&#13;
and runoffs. Rivers overflowed their banks, flooding adjacent agricultural land and&#13;
urban areas, particularly, those situated near the mouth of the rivers.&#13;
Even protected riverbanks were eroded, threatening roads and private property;&#13;
bridges and culverts were washed away and sediment was deposited on the banks&#13;
and in the riverbed, obstructing the natural flow of the river.&#13;
In the immediate period after the storm, the Government of St. Lucia embarked upon&#13;
a programme of reconstruction to repair the damage caused by the storm.&#13;
Part of this programme involves the desilting and retraining of the major rivers. It is&#13;
imperative that obstructions to river channels be removed during this current dry&#13;
season January - July, 1 995 to avoid further threat to human life, economic and&#13;
social infrastructure. The programme comprises the following components:&#13;
Removal of boulders, stones, finer material and debris deposited in the&#13;
river bed;&#13;
Resectioning of river beds, so that "design" discharges can be passed&#13;
safely; and&#13;
Restoring existing and/or applying new river training and bank protection&#13;
works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
2.   INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
An Interministerial Committee (IMC) comprising the Ministries of Planning,&#13;
Agriculture, and Communications, Works and Transport has been formed to co-&#13;
ordinate this project.&#13;
The Ministry of Planning will be the Central Co-ordinating Ministry with its&#13;
Permanent Secretary as Chairman of the IMC.&#13;
During the initial stages of the project, fortnightly meetings of the IMC will be&#13;
held and then monthly, as the project continues.&#13;
The priority works component involving clearing, desilting, resectioning, bank&#13;
strengthening, and minor training will be executed on a design/construct basis&#13;
by a design/supervision team.&#13;
This team, comprising two consultancy attachments; a river engineering adviser&#13;
and a resident engineer, together with a local civil engineer, two works&#13;
supervisors and other technical staff as needed from the Ministry of Works will&#13;
form the Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU), responsible for execution of all&#13;
priority works. The PCU will act on behalf of and report to the Chief Engineer,&#13;
Ministry of Communications, Works and Transport.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE WATERSHED&#13;
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PARTICIPATION PROGRAM&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Saint Lucia Watershed and Environmental Management Project (the Project) is concemed&#13;
with rehabilitation and reconstruction following tropical storm Debbie (TSD), and with medium&#13;
and long term measures for sustainable environmental watershed development. The Project&#13;
comprises:&#13;
Phase I     the construction of priority river and drainage works; and&#13;
- carrying out hydrological and geomorphological surveys, installing hydromet&#13;
equipment and initiating slope stabilization trials (this part of the Project will be&#13;
the responsibility of the Phase 2 consultancy.&#13;
Phase 2    - preparing a watershed management plan, designing a pilot project, preparing&#13;
watershed management projects and formulating an institutional development&#13;
program.&#13;
The project concept is shown in Figure 14. The executing agency for Phase 2 will be the&#13;
Ministry of Planning, Development and the Environment (MOPDE) of the Government of St&#13;
Lucia (GOSL). The Project will be coordinated by the World Bank and technical assistance for&#13;
Phase 2 will be provided by ------------ -&#13;
The consultancy services for Phase 2 (the Services) are to be provided by a suitably qualified&#13;
intemational firm of consultants (the Consultant).&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
Following TSD on September 9/10 1994, GOSL requested assistance from the World Bank to&#13;
prepare a reconstruction program and propose longer term measures for sustainable watershed&#13;
management. The project was identified and formulated by GOSL and a World Bank mission in&#13;
early November 1994. Further formulation and preparation were carried out by a team of&#13;
consultants appointed by the World Bank with Technical Assistance from the British&#13;
Govemment. The consultants' report (December 31 1994) contains the background on which the&#13;
proposed consultancy services are based.&#13;
The objective of the Project is to prepare a reconstruction program and a program of longer-term&#13;
measures for sustainable water management which would comprise:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
- a) priority works to rehabilitate storm damage caused by flooding and landslides;&#13;
- b) a medium term plan to redesign hydraulic infrastructure to minimize damage and&#13;
disruption from future stcrm events; and&#13;
- c) a longer term plan to fully integrate land and water management into the framework&#13;
of the draft National Environmental Action Plan.&#13;
St Lucia is located in the Windward Islands between approximately 13°43' and 14°06'N and&#13;
60053' and 61005'W. It covers an area of 616km2. The physical geography is dominated by steep&#13;
slopes formed over volcanic rocks. The central highlands, rising to 950m, are deeply dissected&#13;
by small rivers, fotming 37 watersheds. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1250-1500mm near&#13;
the coast to over 3000mm in the interior mountains, falling mainly between June and December.&#13;
The island lies within the West Indies hurricane belt.&#13;
Agriculture is the dominant form of land use, occupying about 55 percent of the land in 1989.&#13;
Forest then covered about 35 percent, settlements about 9 percent, and bare rock and water the&#13;
remaining 1 percent. More than half the agricultural land is classified as intensively farmed,&#13;
mainly used for monoculture of bananas, partly for mixed food crops, and much of it on steep&#13;
hill slopes. The remaining forest is important for protecting the quality of water supplies taken&#13;
from rivers for domestic, commercial and irrigation uses, as well as to protect slopes against&#13;
unduly rapid rates of runoff and erosion which generate floods and siltation of river channels&#13;
downstream. Road communications are generally good, though the steep topography makes&#13;
construction and maintenance difficult.&#13;
The population of St Lucia increased from about 113,500 in 1980 to 136,000 in 1991, an annual&#13;
growth rate of about 1.8 percent. A high proportion is urban, some 45 percent living in the&#13;
capital, Castries. In the 1991 census, 24 percent of the national labour force was registered as&#13;
directly employed in the agricultural sector. Unemployment is officially estimated at 17 percent,&#13;
yet labour is reported to be difficult to find despite high daily wage rates, averaging ECS25&#13;
(USS10) per day.&#13;
St Lucia is a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States whose economies are&#13;
linked by a common currency, the EC dollar (pegged to the US dollar EC$2.7:USS1.00), and by&#13;
similar major sources of income. All members are affected by the current changes in GATT and&#13;
the formation of the Single European Market which have precipitated changes in various&#13;
preferential tariff arrangements, most notably for bananas, the mainstay of their economies.&#13;
There are numerous regional and subregional organizations and agencies with economic and&#13;
technical development briefs.&#13;
Contributions to GDP in 1992 included agriculture (13%), manufacturing (8%) and tourism&#13;
(10%). Real GDP grew by some 6% per annum 1987-92 reflecting, in part, an increase in&#13;
banana production and export from 84,000 tons to 132,000 tons during that period, supplemented&#13;
substantially by booms in new construction and tourism. However, the recent slow-down in&#13;
economic growth (from 7% in 1992 to 3% in 1993) is also largely attributable to changes in the&#13;
agriculture sector. Banana prices are forecast to fall significantly (20 percent) in the next few&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
years, so other crops such as cocoa, citrus and cut flowers are being promoted to diversify&#13;
agricultural production. Efforts are being made to promote St Lucia's potential for eco-tourism&#13;
and to encourage the manufacturing and international service sectors.&#13;
Tropical storm Debbie (TSD) struck St Lucia on the night of 9/10 September 1994. Some 250-&#13;
500mm   of  rain  fell  within   a  few   hours  in  the  interior  mountains.&#13;
The high rainfall, in combination with the already-saturated soil conditions, resulted in&#13;
devastating floods, aggravated by enormous amounts of debris and sediment derived from&#13;
extensive landslides that occurred on steep slopes, both cultivated and under natural forest, but&#13;
no records are available for discharges and sediment loads.&#13;
The floods caused four deaths, 24 persons were injured, six were reported missing, 37 were made&#13;
homeless and 500 displaced persons had to be accommodated in temporary shelters. Some 150&#13;
families were relocated in higher locations to reduce their vulnerability to future floods. The&#13;
Govemment subsequently estimated the replacement costs of such relocations and community&#13;
development at ECS1O million.&#13;
Loss of income from agricultural production was identified as the main economic impact of TSD.&#13;
Preliminary estimates by the Govemment were that this loss would be equivalent to ECS134.9&#13;
million (12.2% of 1993 GDP). Losses to physical infrastructure (water supplies, roads and&#13;
bridges) were estimated to be ECS74.2 million (6.7% of GDP) which could be reduced by 20&#13;
percent if insurance covers damage to the Roseau Dam. Many farmers have already rehabilitated&#13;
their crops and also desilted blocked drains. Others await the provision by the Govemment of&#13;
river and drainage works necessary to help ensure the viability of on-farm drainage systems.&#13;
Immediately after TSD, the Government embarked on a programme to repair damaged&#13;
infrastructure. -During the emergency relief stage, 80 percent of the water supply was restored,&#13;
temporary bridges installed to replace those destroyed, roads cleared to restore communications,&#13;
and protection works carried out to protect against river erosion. Debris and deposited sediment&#13;
have been removed from urban areas and from critical sections of river chanpels, and drainage&#13;
canals are being cleared of silt. The completion of Roseau dam will be delayed by some eight&#13;
months, but the site has been cleared of debris and construction has resumed.&#13;
Efforts to repair the damage done by TSD will continue in the coming dry season. The aim will&#13;
be to bring the hydraulic infrastructure to a state where it can cope with normal river flow in the&#13;
next rainy season. The first objective of the project is to assist in those efforts.&#13;
OBJECTIVES AND OUTPUTS&#13;
The broad objective of Phase 2 is to initiate sustainable watershed management which would be&#13;
technically, socially, environmentally, economically and financially justified, through production&#13;
of a framework plan and preparation of the first projects and programs. Implementation is to&#13;
begin in the 1996 dry season. The outputs will be:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
a watershed management plan which would provide criteria and guidelines for&#13;
watershed development, and which would present a phased program for the medium and&#13;
long term;&#13;
preparation of a pilot watershed management project in which various structural and&#13;
non structural techniques would be introduced and tested;&#13;
preparation of the first full watershed management project in a priority river/coastal&#13;
system; and&#13;
formulation of an institutional development program, which would establish the&#13;
organization(s) and legislation required to implement watershed management and prepare&#13;
a program of institutional strengthening.&#13;
The Phase I special studies will be managed under Phase 2, for consistency and continuity&#13;
through the Project.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK AND TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
The planning and project/program preparation components of Phase 2 are to be implemented over&#13;
a six month period; with the special activity component starting about two months earlier. A&#13;
preliminary activity chart is shown in Figure C. The Consultant is required to prepare a detailed&#13;
program of activities covering each of the components and indicating the linkages between them.&#13;
1. PHASE 1&#13;
1.1 Special Activities&#13;
The Consultant will advise and assist GOSL in the preparation of specifications and procurement&#13;
documents, and will be responsible for procurement and supervising implementation of:&#13;
1.    Benchmark and River Surveys in priority watersheds. The survey will comprise&#13;
the establishment of permanent benchmarks and their coordinates along priority&#13;
rivers (possibly Cul de Sac, Roseau, Soufriere and Dennery in the first instance).&#13;
The survey will also include levelling in TSD flood marks and taking river cross&#13;
sections at key locations. Initial TOR for the surveys will be prepared by the&#13;
Phase I River Engineering Adviser.&#13;
2.    Landslide Surveys with detailed mapping in priority watersheds. The surveys will&#13;
be based on the report of the OAS-funded geologist which is due in mid-January&#13;
1995. The mapping will be at a scale of 1:10,000 and be used in the later&#13;
preparation of hazard maps (see 2.4 below). Provision is made for a&#13;
geologist/geomorphologist to advise and assist in the surveys and mapping and&#13;
train local staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 4-&#13;
3.    Hydromet Collection System in accordance with Appendix A Provision is to be&#13;
made for a hydrologist/instrument specialist to carry out the first installations and&#13;
to train operatives in installation, operation and data management.&#13;
4.    Pilot Slope Stabilization measures to be initiated, using geo-synthetics and other&#13;
materials. The trials will be incorporated in the Pilot Project.&#13;
1.2 Coordination&#13;
The Consultant will coordinate closely with MOCWT, MOAFF, the Management Consultant, the&#13;
River Engineering Advisor on the progress of design and construction. The Consultant will be&#13;
required to advise and assist MOCWT and MOAFF on any ongoing Phase I activities that may&#13;
continue into the latter half of 1995, and with the preparation of works or other activities which&#13;
may proceed into 1996..&#13;
2. WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
The preparation of the Watershed Management Plan, which will completed within three months&#13;
from the start of Phase I study program, will include the following main activities:&#13;

the background for preparing criteria and guidelines for watershed development.&#13;
2.3   Review the program for Phase 2 and prepare a brief inception report which would outline&#13;
preliminary findings&#13;
Hazard Analysis&#13;
2.4   Using data and material available from special studies and/or any other sources, carry out&#13;
hydrological and geomorphological analyses to prepare hazard maps of selected priority&#13;
catchments. Hazard mapping should also include areas that are vulnerable to tidal&#13;
influences or storm surges during hurricanes. Recommendations to be made for the&#13;
establishment of data collection in low lying coastal settlements, e.g. Dennery, Anse-la-&#13;
Raye etc..&#13;
2.5   Develop a system of hazard forecasting and warning, which will include guidelines for&#13;
public awareness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
Strategies&#13;
2.6    Confirm strategies through examination of land use, agricultural, social, land tenure,&#13;
environmental, economic and institutional issues.&#13;
2.7    Evaluate the existing institutional systems concerned with the development and&#13;
management of water and land resources (including associated coastal zones), and assess&#13;
the regulatory, legal and administrative provisions.&#13;
2.7    Develop criteria and guidelines for watershed conservation, public participation, legislation&#13;
and project identification, selection and prioritisation.&#13;
2.8    Evaluate construction procedures, maintenance provisions and institutional arrangements&#13;
and develop criteria and guidelines for project preparation&#13;

S. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Preliminary&#13;
5.1    Confirm GOSL's strategy for rationalizing institutional arrangements for water and land&#13;
resource development, particularly water management, in the light of the institutional&#13;
recommendations contained in the Watershed Management Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.2   Building on existing institutional frameworks, design the broad structure and organisation&#13;
of the institution responsible for watershed and environmental management, together with&#13;
its proposed powers and linkages with other  concemed agencies. Also make&#13;
recommendations for local involvement.&#13;
5.3   Prepare a brief inception report on the proposed structure and obtain MOPDE's agreement.&#13;
Roles, responsibilities and legislation&#13;
5.4   Design the organisational structure to meet the requirements of watershed development.&#13;
5.5   Define roles and responsibilities of central and local institutions concerned with&#13;
environmental management. Regulatory, monitoring and evaluating activities should&#13;
include:&#13;
-     water use / disposal, quality and priorities;&#13;
-     land use, quality and zoning;&#13;
-     river management, reserves;&#13;
-     waste disposal, sewage treatment and disposal - with particular reference to&#13;
riverine and coastal areas;&#13;
-     urban encroachment on floodplains and wetlands;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.1:3-&#13;
TEAM LEADER/SENIOR WATER RESOURCES PLANNER&#13;
1.    The Team Leader will work closely with the GOSL Project Director and report to the&#13;
Intemiinisterial Steering Comunittee. S/hc will have primary responsibility for plannin the team's work&#13;
and ensunng during Phase I that the they complete five main tasks:&#13;
(a)   review the proposals for those essential river engineering, watercourse maintenance, ad&#13;
drainage works required to secure key iastucure investnts, and prepare a detailed&#13;
priority works program for implementation in early 1995;&#13;
(b)   review hydrologic and environmental hazards and risks, determine likely financial&#13;
economic, social, and eavironmental costs and benefits, and produce guidelines to idenf&#13;
economically justified projects;&#13;
(c)    produce the outline of a 5-7 year strategic plan to safely and economically stabilize natural&#13;
flood and drainage routes to the sea; the outline should also include provision for&#13;
aitenance;&#13;
(d)   review GOSL institutional capability and make rommedaons for (i) coordination md&#13;
maunagement of the priority works progrAm, and the follow-on Phase II TA activities, and&#13;
(ii) institutional set-up, development and training needed to establish sound wateshed&#13;
management in St. Lucia;&#13;
(e) identify and prepare a detaUiled work and staung plan for the Phase II activities which will&#13;
include (i) implementation of priority river engneering works (cf (a) above), landslide bio-&#13;
gineering and engineering, design of future civil engineing works, and progams for&#13;
watershed mnagemet including affected coastal and mane environents; (ai)&#13;
identification of policy issues, legal and legislative needs relating to sustaiable land use&#13;
and management within watrsheds; (iu) review  of the national fiaework for&#13;
environmental management in the country, including forest conservation and national&#13;
parks; and (iv) assessment of institutional capacity, and additional support roquire, to&#13;
implemt the national environmental acion plan and effective watershed management&#13;
2.    The team leader's particular responsibility will be tasks (c) and (e) above. In addtidon, as requird,&#13;
the team leader will liaise with the World Bank's Pro-Appraisal Mission provisionally scheduled for mid-&#13;
Docember, and ensure that the outputs of the OAS landslide specialis(s) are incorported in the Phae I&#13;
report as appropriate. Following the team's rm os and Bank and co-financiers' review, a second&#13;
TA team would be fielded for about 6 months to implement Phase II in the firs half of 1995, prbably&#13;
startng about March. However, depending upon finin/co-financing arragements areed for Phase H.&#13;
the Consultants may have to be selected by competitive bidding which could significantly delay the Phase U&#13;
program. GOSL and World Bank's expectations for Phase I arc described below for guidance.&#13;
3.    Phase H activities are provisionally expected to ectend for about six months, but depending upon&#13;
the findings and recommendations of the Phase I team this could be longer. At this stage the proposals for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
Phase U are indicative of the broader issues and questions discussed with GOSL and development partas&#13;
in Barbados. Many of the problems addressed by the current emergency rehabilitation programs aru&#13;
symptoms of a severely stressed natural resource system, prime causes being expansion of smallholdr&#13;
agricultre to upland catchments, removal of native vegetation and unsustainable land managancu&#13;
practices. The overall objectives are to develop a plan to reverse the current environmental imbalance m&#13;
upland ca±chrmcts and facilitate socially and environmentally sound land, agricultural and water&#13;
management which will lead to increased agricultural productivity.  During the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the projects, spocial attention would be given to address rural employment issues which&#13;
include provision of a social safety nct. Major activities and outputs are expected to include:&#13;
1. A National Watershed Manseement Plan. IThis plan will require elaboration of the strategic&#13;
watershed management plau outlined in Phase I including issues of national environmetal&#13;
sustainability and management.&#13;
2. Institutional Strenithenine Program. Implementation of the watershed management plan will&#13;
require well coordinaed environmental management, and a najor task would be to ideny  a&#13;
suitable existing or new institution to take this responsibility. In addition, it would involve training&#13;
and new legislation to mandate ElAs and Environmental Management Plans for projects as well as&#13;
policies which would encourage sustainable watershed management within the farming community.&#13;
3. Legislative Framework for Environmental Management. There is a considerable body of&#13;
environmentally related legislation on the stactt books, but for various reasons it is not applied.&#13;
Part of this is because there is no single agency charged with its systematic application, and this&#13;
would be addressed by output 2 above. A series of lessons could be learned from a detailed&#13;
analysis of existing legislation relaing to land, water and agricultural management and its&#13;
inplementation. Particular areas of concern that could be addressed would be (a) resetement&#13;
programs which might be required by long term environmental management measures identified,&#13;
(b) poople's participation in the planning and project implementation process and (c) restrictions on&#13;
land use. Te lesson leamed could then be used to develop a matrix of options for reform of&#13;
existing legislation, and new  legal instruments and enforcement mechanisms to facilite&#13;
achievement of socially and environmentally sound, and financially and economically viable,&#13;
watershed management.&#13;
4.    The National WatersLed Management Plan would produce proposals to meet imnm te needs fDr&#13;
flood warning, protection, and zoning, and longer term remedies to mitigate environmental degradation of&#13;
watersheds. The first pridrity will be hydrologic analysis to classify and map hydrologic hazards and risks&#13;
to produce a floodplain zoning map, and make recommendations for flood preparedness, waming and&#13;
evacuation plans, and production of a landslide hazard map (to be undertaken by OAS). Using the results&#13;
of GOSL flood damage and water course survpy, a prioritized list and project description of econorically&#13;
justifiod watershed, river stabilization and maintenance projects could be produced, and it is expecte tat&#13;
the firt five could be designed to feasibility level, the balance to pre-feasibility level.&#13;
5.    Longer term sustainability will only be achieved if the causes of land degradation which lead to&#13;
watershed management problems can be identified. his can be achieved by an evaluation of climate, lauId,&#13;
soil resources and land use to make recommnedations for agro-ecological zoning. Agro-ecological zoning&#13;
will provide the physical basis for crop diversification. Land and agricultural management skills will need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assessment to determine complementary agricultural extension needs. Factoring in market opporuniie,&#13;
constraints and realities of the national and regional economy and intemational trade will determine a&#13;
feasible range of opporanities for diversification to maximize agicutural productivity. The imperative for&#13;
employment generation and a social safety net will define a socially and politically feaible agricultl and&#13;
land use stategy.&#13;
6.    Longer term viability of public sector components of the wateed management plan will depted&#13;
upon the degree to which GOSL water management projects become vested in local communities ai&#13;
institutions, and moet real needs and peoples' exptations.  Initially, this will depend upoo public&#13;
participation in the pLaning design and implemntation process. If such efforts are successful, either ca&#13;
recovery or transference of rouie maintenance becomes feasible. Consequently, a major effort should be&#13;
to formulate recommendations to enable either early turnover or pilot cost recovery schwmes for projie&#13;
implemented in the priority works program of Phase I and the five projects identified to feasibility level i&#13;
Phase II.&#13;
7.    One result of the study could be policy recommendations for land reforn, and to improve&#13;
agriculture and land management in the public and private sectors. While major progress could be made&#13;
through macro-economic measures, policy options for sustainable land and water nianagement need to be&#13;
tested and ref&amp;ned to become effective instruments to guide development, particularly where do&#13;
environment is concerned. Thus, a pilot watershed could be selected and monitored for a period of say Awe&#13;
years or to about year 2000 to test the mnge of options and project ypes identified, to detemine wht is&#13;
feasible and effective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-4 6-&#13;
RIVER TRAINING SPECIALISTIENGINEER&#13;
1.    The fit task and primary responsibility of the river maining specialist/enginer will be to prepare&#13;
the priority civil engineering works program required to secure kcy  asiunctr investments to be&#13;
implemented in Phase II. These works will be financed by the World Bank. To achieve this, s./he will work&#13;
with GOSL staff to finaii the river channel damage assessment. FoUowing damage assessment and&#13;
review of GOSL proposals for those essential river engineering, waercourse maitenance, and drainage&#13;
works, she will prepare and budget a detailed priority works program for implementation in early 1995 in&#13;
the cost range USS3-6 nillion which will be financed by the World Bank. Priority civil enneering works&#13;
will be only selcted if they comply with projects described in either Category A or B of the World Bank's&#13;
Operational Directve 4.01, Annex A. To ensure that such a program can be financed by the World Bank&#13;
and is implamentable, s./he will (a) review governrment contacting procurement prctie and (b) asess&#13;
adequacy and capability of government and private sector civil enigineering conuctors and plant and (c)&#13;
make recommendations for procurement in line with World Bank rules on procurement and supervision of&#13;
civil engineering conractg services.&#13;
2.    The second task will be to desip the TA for Phase I to enure the hydrologic and river&#13;
engineerig aspects of the proposed National Watershed Management Plan are adequately covered. ITis&#13;
would requie proposals to meet immediate needs for flood waming, protecdon, and zoning, and longer&#13;
tem remedies to mitigate envionmental degradation of waterheds. The first priority will be hydrologic&#13;
analysis to classify and map hydrologic haards and risks to produce a floodplain zonig nap, and make&#13;
reommendations for flood preparedness, waming and evacuation plans, and production of a landslide&#13;
hazard map (to be undertake by OAS). Using the results of GOSL flood damage and water course&#13;
surveys, a prioritzed list and project description of economically justified watershed, river stabilization and&#13;
maintenance project could be produced, and it is expected during Phase U that the first five could be&#13;
desigmed to feuibility level, the balance to pre-feasibility level.&#13;
WATERSHEDILANVD USE SPE:CIALSIS&#13;
1.    The primary responsibility of the watershed/land use specialist will be to work with GOSL to&#13;
assess agncultural and land use plannin practices, issues and relatd data bases in Saint Lucia in order to&#13;
prepare the work plan for the Phase U watershd and landuse management activities. Longer term&#13;
suwainability will only be achieved if the causes of land degradation which lead to watershed mnagmet&#13;
problems can be identified. This can be achieved by an evaluation of climate, land, soil resources and lacd&#13;
use to make recommendations for agro-ecological zoning. Ago-ecological zoning will provide the physical&#13;
basis for crop diversification. Land and agicultural management skills will need assessment to detemine&#13;
complementary agncultural  tension needs.&#13;
2.     The major task of the watershedllanduse specialist is to determine the mnthods and approach&#13;
required to evaluate these problem and design a TA program for Phase I to implement them. In particular&#13;
this will require (a) review of current lnd use legislation and practices, (b) reconnaissance evaluation of&#13;
agriculturl practices related to soil and land suitability and (c), working closely with the landslide&#13;
specialist and bioengineer to determine a program of investigation in Phase 1 to relate changing land use to&#13;
ladslide harzard and general soil erosion. More generally, s./e will review soil and agro-climatic data&#13;
bases to determine what needs doing during Phase U to initiate agro-ecological zoning of Saint Lucia. As a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
result of these activities, and an assessment of institutional needs, he/she will draft a workplan describing&#13;
what actions and investigations are required during Phase II to make policy, legal and institutional&#13;
recommnendations to achieve sustainable land use which will lead to effective watershed management.&#13;
SOCIAL SCIENTIST&#13;
1.    The primary responsibility of the social scientist is to design a work for the Phase II studies. The&#13;
overall objectives are to develop a socio-economic and environmentally sustainable plan the reverse the&#13;
current imbalance in upland catchments and facilitate changes in agricultural and water management&#13;
practices that can lead to increase agricultural productivity within sound environmental terms. During the&#13;
preparation and implementation of the projects, the social scientist will give special attention to identify&#13;
the affected and benefitted population and the relevant social actors (stakeholders) that are or should be&#13;
involvei within the decision- making process for project design and implementation.&#13;
2.     During Phase I, s/he will (a) organize the consultation and participatory process: information to&#13;
be disseminated, strategies, double-way communications, grievance mechanisms, incorporation of social&#13;
consideration within the project design and implementation; contact relevant governmental and non-&#13;
governmental agencies; (b) determine de social feasibility of the priority civil works embraced by the&#13;
project (specially the five projects already identified); (c) assess the socio-economic sustainability of the&#13;
project (social costs and benefits); (d) make suggestions to incorporate social consideration within the&#13;
projects; (e) develop a work plan for Phase II to promote socio-economically justified projects based upon&#13;
hazards, risks (to be identified by engineers and environmentalists), social vulnerability of the population&#13;
involved capacity for adopting new agricultural practices, etc..&#13;
3.    In addition, during Phase I, the social scientist will (a) identify and evaluate the socio-economic&#13;
and cultural implications derived from unavoidable displacement of population; (b) prepare a draft&#13;
resettlement policy to be discussed and finally adopted by the borrower and, (c) design an outline for a&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation action plan (for phase II) to be discussed with the govermnent and the&#13;
affected families.&#13;
4.    In developing the plan for Phase I, particular areas of concern that should be addressed are: (d)&#13;
implementation of work programn for the population that will remain in place, which might require long-&#13;
term socioeconomic and environmental measures, specially in regarding long-term sustainable agriculture&#13;
and management of natural resources; (e) implementation of a resettlement and rehabilitation plan for the&#13;
population that necessarily will be removed, and (f) make sure that a participatory process will be put in&#13;
place to implement the project sub-components. The lessons learned could then be used to develop a&#13;
matrix of options for reform of existing legislation and to modify the projects design in order to achieve&#13;
an environmentally sound management plan for the watershed.&#13;
S.     Viability of public sector components of the watershed management plan over the long term will&#13;
depend upon the degree to which GOSL water management projects become vested in local communities&#13;
and institutions, and meet real needs and peoples' expectations. Initially, this will depend upon public&#13;
participation in the planning, design and implementation process. If such efforts are successful, either cost&#13;
recovery or tansference of routine maintenance becomes feasible. Consequently, in Phase II a major effort&#13;
should be to formulate recommendations to enable either early tumover or pilot cost recovery schemes for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
projects implemented in the priority works program of Phase I and the five projects identified to feasibity&#13;
level in Phase I1.&#13;
BIO-ENGINEERING EXPERT&#13;
1.    The bioing expert will (a) work with the OAS landslide expert to determine appropriate&#13;
replann of high risk areas to reduce landslide hazard and (b) develop a work program for Phase II to&#13;
ensure that the latest techiques and local knowledge of bio-enginering applications are inclided in de&#13;
river stabiliztion, land ue and watesheo managemcnt plan. To ensure bio-engineering techniques are&#13;
sustaible, plans ould be made to include a monitoring and evaluation program. S/he will assess local&#13;
institutional kmowledge and capability and make  r endations for institutional development and&#13;
training to be carried out during Phase IL&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAIST&#13;
1.    The envionmentist's primary responsibilities are (a) design the work program for the terrestrial&#13;
and near shore marine ecology investigations which will lead to recommendatons for sustainable waterhed&#13;
management in Phase H and (b) design a work program to review and make recommendations for the&#13;
legisltive framework for evironmental management.&#13;
2.    At this stage the proposals for Phase H are indicative of the broader issues and questions discssed&#13;
with GOSL and development partners in Barbados. Many of the problems addressed by the curnt&#13;
emergency rehabilitatio progams are symptons of a severely stessed natural resource systen, primc&#13;
cause being expansion of smaUlolder agiculture to upland catchments, removal of native vegetation and&#13;
unsustainale land nanagem_t practices. The overall objectives are to develop a plan to reverse the&#13;
curent eviroental imbalance in upland catchments and facilitate socially and environmentally sound&#13;
land, gricultunal and water management which will lead to increased agricultural productivity. S/he will&#13;
have to consider, apart fiom ersion within the wateshds, indirect and longer term impacts of flooding&#13;
incude loss of productive soils, leaching of residual soil nutrients, and water logging of valley bottom land&#13;
because of infilled river beds. In additon, discharge of slit laden streamfiow to in-shore water connues to&#13;
cause significant but ill defined, ecological impact as reef and habitats are cloaked in sediment In view&#13;
of the fact that eco-ourism is a major source of Saint Lucia's GDP, the environmentalist will need to give&#13;
special attention to mitigating near-shore and in-shore damage to coral reefs and Marine habitats.&#13;
3.    Thre is a considerable body of ir          related legislation on the statute books, but for&#13;
vanous reasons it is not applied, one being that thre is no single agency charged with its systemic&#13;
application A series of lessons could be leanod from a detailed analysis of existing legislation relating to&#13;
land, wata and agicuklurl  anagmt and its implementation. Partclar areas of concern that could be&#13;
addressed would be (a) rsertlem  prograns which might be required by long term envir     l&#13;
management measures idetified, (b) people's participation in the planning and project implementation&#13;
process and (c) restrictions on land use. The lessons lead could then be used to develop a matrix of&#13;
options for reform of exting lgistion, and new legal instuments and enforcement mechanisms to&#13;
facilitate achievement of socially and environmentally sound, and financially and economically viable,&#13;
watershed management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
4.    One result of the study could be policy recommndations for land reforn, and to improve&#13;
agricultumre and land managenint in the public and private sectors. While major progress could be made&#13;
through macro-economic measures, policy options for sustainable land and water maagemt need to be&#13;
tested and refined to become effective instruments to guide developmet, parucularly where the&#13;
environment is concerned. ITus, the environmental study would play a key role in selecing a pilo&#13;
watershed which would be monitored for a period of say five years or to about year 2000 to test the range&#13;
of options and project types identified, to determine what is enviroamentally feasible and effective.&#13;
5.    Finally, the environmentalist has prmary responsibility for reewing the civil enoring worksi&#13;
program developed during Phase I to ensure that it complies with EIA impact cls  A or B of the World&#13;
Bank's Operational Dirctive .4.01, Annex A. In addition, the environmentalist will advise GOSL on the&#13;
eavironmmital implications and resetilement plannin of Project Acted Peoples if the proposed flood&#13;
plain zoning at Dennery on the west coast is requested by GOSL.&#13;

Watershed and Environment Management Project&#13;
Participation Program&#13;
Proposal&#13;
Foreword&#13;
Participation is increasingly recognized as a necessary part of sustainable&#13;
development strategies. Experience suggests the benefits of development efforts are more&#13;
likely to be sustained when the ultimate clients are involved in designing and implementing&#13;
the work involved.&#13;
In the case of the Watershed and Environment Management Project, participation&#13;
is particularly important at various stages. For example, as it has been pointed out in the&#13;
Preparation Report on the project, clean up works to be effective should be coordinated&#13;
with landowners' work on farm drainage system.&#13;
This Report also states that in the future, the most serious issue in watershed&#13;
management is how to prevent further expansion of cultivation into St. Lucia's remaining&#13;
forest areas and persuade the farmers cultivating steep hill land to give up practices which&#13;
cause soil erosion and subsequent flash floods, river siltation, crop and properties' damage&#13;
and deterioration of land and water quality downstream areas.&#13;
Indeed, all the efforts of St. Lucia Government would be insufficient without the&#13;
cooperation of farmers and population living by the riversides.  To change some&#13;
agricultural practices that have proved cause negative impact on flow of rivers will take&#13;
time, patience and wide participation.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The main objective of the proposed Participation Program is to imnprove the quality&#13;
of the Watershed and Environment Management Project's design and implementation by&#13;
systematically incorporating the involved population's views and commitment to its&#13;
results, and to succeed in some specific objectives such as:&#13;
(a)   to inform farmers and the population in general, about the objectives of the&#13;
Project;&#13;
(b)   to provide people the opportunity to participate in the implementation of&#13;
the Project so as to ensure its sustainabiity and maintenance; and&#13;
(c)   to institutionalize within the Government the participatory approach by&#13;
setting up an appropriate organization to prepare and implement the&#13;
participation program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
Activities&#13;
In accordance to these objectives, the Participation Program would have three&#13;
main activities: (i) Information; (ii) short term actions to support the ongoing clean up of&#13;
rivers; and (iii) long-term actions for sustainability and maintenance of the Project.&#13;
Information&#13;
Information should have at least two different targets: (i) general&#13;
population; and (ii) farmers and population by the riversides. In both cases,&#13;
delivery of information should be clear and simple for a common understanding.&#13;
(i)   Information to the first group would include dissemination of the&#13;
objectives of the Project, the efforts undertaken by the Government&#13;
and the importance for the future of the country to maintain rivers'&#13;
watersheds. A mass media communication campaign might be&#13;
advisable for this purpose; and&#13;
(ii)   Information to the second group, or beneficiaries of the project,&#13;
should be more precise and direct, emphasizing the need of their&#13;
cooperation. Workshops to be held by relevant organizations such&#13;
as the Banana Growers Association, the National Farmers&#13;
Association, or other local organizations, are recommended.&#13;
Short-Term Actions&#13;
It is important to involve farmers and population living by riverside in the&#13;
clean up of the rivers. Once they have received relevant information, some direct&#13;
actions should be organized at local level such as drainage at farm lands; support in&#13;
the removal of debris and garbage cleaning, for instance. The engineers in charge&#13;
of the technical aspects of the project can help to select some other actions where&#13;
the local population might participate.&#13;
Long-Term Actions&#13;
The design of these actions should consider the following stages: Oi&#13;
dissemination of information on the need of the activities promoted; (ii) setting up&#13;
of consultation mechanisms and sharing of decision making on the actions to be&#13;
undertaken, (iii) formation of committees of beneficiaries or other kind of&#13;
organizations at grass root level to be in charge of the works; and (iv)&#13;
strengthening the ability of these organizations to carry out the works. The&#13;
following measures are to be considered as part of the long term actions:&#13;
(i)    provision of technical assistance to adopt agricultural practices less&#13;
damaging to the flow of rivers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
(ii)   reforestation and other forestry activities;&#13;
(iii)   river bank protection;&#13;
(iv)    soil protection programs to prevent erosion and subsequent river&#13;
siltation;&#13;
(v)    improvement of housing design to reduce risk of flooding; and&#13;
(vi)   avoid dumping garbage in the rivers.&#13;
Consultation and Incentives&#13;
Both, short- and long-termn actions to be successful should be the result of&#13;
consultation with the beneficiaries; provision of some kind of incentives and appreciation&#13;
to participants should be considered. Workshops or other similar techniques are useful for&#13;
a quick consultation; NGO's and grass root organizations could be also very helpful in this&#13;
aspect.&#13;
Incentives should not be of monetary kind, quite the opposite; they could be in the&#13;
form of technical assistance; support for demonstrative plots; donation of plants for&#13;
reforestation; public awards and if possible, improvements to the community to&#13;
compensate its efforts, are recommended. It is advisable to take into account existent&#13;
programs and entities to organize consultation and provide incentives.&#13;
Stakeholders&#13;
Identification of relevant stakeholders is crucial for the purposes of any&#13;
participation program. This selection would be determined by the situation and the type of&#13;
activities to be supported. For example, to change agricultural practices, the National&#13;
Farmers Association might be a relevant stakeholder. To clean and avoid the disposal of&#13;
garbage in the rivers, the social clubs or other community level organizations would be&#13;
best suited for this purpose. Some environmental groups might also get involved in the&#13;
promotion of participation and disseminating information on the Project.&#13;
Institutional Frmework&#13;
The Ministry of Planning has been appointed as general coordinator of the Project&#13;
with the Ministries of Communication, Works and Transport and Agriculture, Lands,&#13;
Fisheries and Forestry, in charge of the main works. For the purposes of the Participation&#13;
Program, the main activities lay in the field of the Ministry of Agriculture; however, some&#13;
ministries such as Education and Labor, Health and Local Government and Youth,&#13;
Community Development, Social Affairs, Sports and Operatives, might also have a&#13;
supportive role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
However, the experience of these ministries in a programn of participation is not&#13;
clear, therefore, the most suitable entity to be responsible for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the program should be selected.&#13;
It was suggested by the Ministry of Planning that a Committee at the ministerial&#13;
level might be appointed to deal with participation. The set up of this Committee would&#13;
be an important step and prove of Government's commitment to the participation&#13;
program. Nevertheless, a more operational organization might be necessary to promote,&#13;
organize and monitor the Participation Program.&#13;
The design of this organization to be in charge of the program, its functions and&#13;
identification of its human resources and financial needs must receive special attention&#13;
during preparation ofthe Participation Program. Managers and policy makers in St. Lucia&#13;
have to be involved in this process. It would be advisable to appoint a team of technicians&#13;
and social scientists from the different ministries implicated to carry out the various&#13;
activities of the Program and to take the leading role in its implementation.&#13;
Pilot Effort&#13;
The long-term actions intended for sustainability and maintenance of the Project&#13;
might prove difficult to undertake at a national level at a first stage. Furthermore, some of&#13;
these activities would possibly need some kind of adjustment to improve results.&#13;
Therefore, it is recommended to start with a pilot effort before a generalized set up is&#13;
established.&#13;
This pilot effort could be initiated in Roseau and Cul de Sac, both places seriously&#13;
damaged by Debbie and where some traditional agricultural practices actually endanger&#13;
the sustainability and maintenance of the project.&#13;
Existing programs within the Government, private institutions and NGO's, related&#13;
to the participation program's activities should be incorporated to this effort to profit from&#13;
their experience and practices.&#13;
Schedule of Preparation&#13;
The schedule to prepare the Participation Program should be coordinated with the&#13;
preparation of the Watershed and Environment Management Project in order to support&#13;
its objectives, therefore, careful timing is important. The following aspects and dates&#13;
should be considered:&#13;
(a)   Agreement on terms of reference, budget and appointment of consultant(s)&#13;
and/or members of the Government for the preparation of the Participation&#13;
Program should be ready by March 1995;&#13;
(b)   A first draft on the campaign for general information purposes should be&#13;
prepared in April or as soon as an agreement is reached on terms of&#13;
reference;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
(c)   The Participation Program should be ready in three months, on time to be&#13;
integrated into the Management Plan. Therefore, preparation should begin&#13;
by March-April and end by June-July;&#13;
(d)   The pilot effort should begin as soon as possible and have some results as&#13;
feed back after three months of initiated. The expected findings should&#13;
include factors of success and constrains in implementation; and&#13;
(e)   A monitoring system would be set up and kept during a period of two&#13;
years to document on advances and problems of the Program every six&#13;
months, enough to have some results on the expected objectives.&#13;
Preparation&#13;
To attain to the proposed schedule, it is suggested a full-time team be appointed to&#13;
prepare the Program. A consultant with social background and experience in participation&#13;
or social development should be hired to coordinate the team, concentrate infornation and&#13;
prepare the final Program. Government's officials forming part of the team should be&#13;
conunitted to the Program and disseminate their experiences within Government's entities&#13;
to institutionalize the participatory approach.&#13;

            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Watershed and Environmental
            Management Project will: (i) initiate the immediate
            rehabilitation of the hydraulic infrastructure of priority
            watersheds from the damage caused by the flooding and
            landslides. These works are intended to reduce the danger to
            livelihoods and property from future flooding; (ii) address
            the medium and long term requirements for sustainable
            watershed development by preparing a Watershed Management
            Plan which will serve as the basis for more integrated,
            conservation-minded development of key watersheds; and (iii)
            strengthen the Government's capacities in environmental
            management and flood preparedness. Hence, the Government
            will seek the direct participation of the population in the
            project's activities and also attempt to build greater
            local capacity of Saint Lucian professionals to engage in them.
