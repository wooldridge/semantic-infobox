EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
I.	Systematic failures in governance in the               projected rise of 0.6 percentage points (pp) in the&#13;
face of seismic shocks in an environment of               overall fiscal deficit to 7.2 percent of GDP due&#13;
endemic corruption could result in a rupture.             primarily to lack of the one-off revenue measures&#13;
Creeping political paralysis has rendered the three       that boosted revenues in 2014. Externally, lower&#13;
branches of government either vacant or ineffective.      oil prices, as well as a more broad contraction in&#13;
Moreover, the collapse of public services, such as        imports, are expected to induce a 5 pp narrowing of&#13;
electricity, water supply and a visually powerful         the current account deficit, which will nevertheless&#13;
garbage crisis that has left piles of it uncollected on   remain elevated at a forecast 21 percent of GDP.&#13;
the streets, led to sizable popular demonstrations.       This, however, was more than offset by lower&#13;
All the while, Lebanon continues to face momentous        capital inflows adversely affecting the net foreign&#13;
challenges emanating from the war in Syria, including     asset position of the financial sector. Nonetheless,&#13;
hosting the largest assembly of Syrian refugees (in       gross foreign exchange reserves at BdL are expected&#13;
proportion to the population).                            to increase to US$ 34.5 billion by end of 2015 as&#13;
                                                          commercial banks continue to repatriate their&#13;
II.	Notwithstanding               the        political    foreign assets in search of higher yields.&#13;
dysfunctionality, improved security conditions&#13;
have provided a boost for economic activity in            IV.	A negative output gap combined with&#13;
2015. Growth has been driven by a resurgent tourism       declining commodity prices lead to a deceleration&#13;
sector and continued expansion in private lending         in prices. Real GDP growth continues to lag behind,&#13;
as Banque du Liban (BdL) renewed its stimulus             compared to an average rate of 4.4 percent from 1993&#13;
package in the amount of $1 billion this year; tourist    to 2014. In addition, headline inflation plummeted&#13;
arrivals increased by 16.6 percent, year-on-year          from 2.7 percent in 2013 to a forecast 0.2 percent&#13;
(yoy), in the first eight months of 2015, compared        in 2015 and is expected to remain tempered over&#13;
to a mere increase of 0.7 percent during the              the medium term. This, in addition to exchange rate&#13;
corresponding period in 2014. On the other hand,          stability reflected in a gradual fall in the dollarization&#13;
the real estate sector has acted as a drag on growth,     rate, has provided the basis for an expansionary&#13;
with construction permits and cement deliveries           monetary policy as reflected in the series of BdL&#13;
contracting by about 18.8 percent and 16.7 percent,       stimulus packages in the form of subsidized loans.&#13;
respectively, during the first seven months of 2015.&#13;
Overall, we project that growth will remain around        V.	Spillovers from the war in Syria remain a&#13;
2 percent this year, largely unchanged from 2014.         principal short-term challenge, despite the recent&#13;
                                                          respite, which cannot be guaranteed due to severe&#13;
III.	   The decline in oil prices has so far had          volatility. Moreover, uncertainty over Americaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
net positive effects on the Lebanese economy,             Federal Reserve Board (FED) tightening this year&#13;
freeing up savings for both internal and external         has made monetary policy expectations in Lebanon&#13;
imbalances. Fiscally, lower transfers to the state-       somewhat ambiguous; despite the preferred&#13;
owned Electricity du Liban (EdL), in addition to          expansionary stance reflected in the subsequent BdL&#13;
increased scrutiny of expenditures by the present         stimulus packages, upon FED tightening, Lebanon&#13;
Ministry of Finance, are expected to help maintain        would be bound to follow suit to maintain the&#13;
a primary surplus in 2015. This is despite a small        margin on USD and LBP deposits in Lebanon. This&#13;

&#13;
will negatively impact lending to the private sector&#13;
and raise Lebanonâ&#128;&#153;s large debt service, as new debt&#13;
will need to be contracted at higher interest rates&#13;
given the ongoing large gross financing needs.&#13;
&#13;
VI.	     Lebanonâ&#128;&#153;s post-civil war governance&#13;
system has evolved and deteriorated to a point of&#13;
failing the country and its citizens (Special Focus&#13;
#1). The public sector has become increasingly&#13;
governed by bribery and nepotism practices, failing&#13;
to deliver basic public services and incapable of&#13;
resolving the most urgent needs. This has culminated&#13;
in the comprehensive breakdown in the political&#13;
process, with the three branches of government&#13;
either vacant or effectively idle, and the only&#13;
national plebiscite abrogated. Since the summer, a&#13;
series of protests and civil disobedience measures&#13;
eruptedâ&#128;&#148;sparked by failure to collect garbage in the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#148;and is targeting the ruling political class&#13;
with emphasis on corruption and incompetence.&#13;
Current conditions are unsustainable, and without&#13;
significant political and economic reforms, a&#13;
widening and worsening of socio-economic unrest&#13;
is not unfathomable.&#13;
&#13;
VII.	Lebanonâ&#128;&#153;s healthcare system is a complex&#13;
amalgam of public and private institutions,&#13;
providing health services to the population&#13;
(Special Focus #2). Key challenges include; (i) low&#13;
public spending on health; (ii) high household out-&#13;
of-pocket spending on health; (iii) disproportionate&#13;
allocation of resources on expensive curative&#13;
rather than preventative care; and (iv) emerging&#13;
epidemiologic and population trends associated with&#13;
unprecedented influx of refugees having significant&#13;
implications on the delivery and financing of the&#13;
health sector. Despite the challenges and prolonged&#13;
periods of instability, the Ministry of Public Health&#13;
embarked on several successful reforms that&#13;
contributed to the resilience of the system in the&#13;
face of the crisis.&#13;

demeure lâ&#128;&#153;un des principaux dÃ©fis Ã  court terme,          de la santÃ© et son financement. MalgrÃ© les dÃ©fis et&#13;
malgrÃ© le rÃ©cent rÃ©pit, qui ne peut cependant pas         les longues pÃ©riodes dâ&#128;&#153;instabilitÃ©, le MinistÃ¨re de la&#13;
Ãªtre garanti en raison dâ&#128;&#153;une grave instabilitÃ©. En        SantÃ© Publique a mis sur pied plusieurs rÃ©formes qui&#13;

expansionniste suivie par la BdL serait impactÃ©e Ã &#13;

normalisation des taux compte tenu de la nÃ©cÃ©ssitÃ©&#13;
de maintenir une marge entre les dÃ©pÃ´ts en dollars&#13;

durant la pÃ©riode dâ&#128;&#153;aprÃ¨s-guerre civile sâ&#128;&#153;est&#13;
dÃ©tÃ©riorÃ© au point que lâ&#128;&#153;Etat nâ&#128;&#153;a plus la capacitÃ©&#13;
de dÃ©cemment servir le pays et ses citoyens&#13;
(Dossier No 1). Le secteur public est devenu de&#13;
plus en plus rÃ©gi et capturÃ© par la corruption et&#13;
le nÃ©potisme, et se trouve incapable dâ&#128;&#153;assurer les&#13;
services publics de base ou de rÃ©pondre aux besoins&#13;
les plus urgents des citoyens. Cette ineptitude est&#13;
illustrÃ©e par lâ&#128;&#153;inefficacitÃ© ou la vacance au niveau de&#13;
la tÃªte des trois postes les plus Ã©levÃ©s de la fonction&#13;
publique et surtout par le blocage de lâ&#128;&#153;Ã©lection&#13;
prÃ©sidentielle. Depuis lâ&#128;&#153;Ã©tÃ©, une sÃ©rie de mouvements&#13;
de protestation et des mesures de dÃ©sobÃ©issance&#13;
civile, dÃ©clenchÃ©s par la crise des dÃ©chets, ont vu le&#13;
jour, visant la classe politique et mettant en cause&#13;
sa corruption et son incompÃ©tence. Cette situation&#13;
ne peut durer sans avoir dâ&#128;&#153;importantes rÃ©percussion&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    The output gap is an economic measure of the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential&#13;
    output, such that if it is positive the economy is running at above potential. Due to uncertainties surrounding output&#13;
    gap estimation techniques and due to data limitations for which Lebanon is known, two alternative estimation&#13;
    techniques are employed: The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and a Production Function (PF) model. The HP filter is&#13;
    a de-trending statistical method, which we employ using three standard smoothing parameters. To minimize the&#13;
    end-point bias that the HP filter is normally susceptible to, the sample period is extended through 2017 using World&#13;
    Bank staff projections. Output gap is also estimated using a PF model, which is a structural method incorporating&#13;
    economic theory that relates output to total factor productivity and production inputs. The output gap for Lebanon is&#13;
    estimated using the sample periods of 1988-2017 and 1990-2017 for the HP and the PF methodologies, respectively.&#13;
    For most periods, the estimation methods yield different output gap, both in levels and cumulative; nevertheless, the&#13;
    trajectories generated by the four methodologies are highly correlated. An immediate observation is that there exists&#13;
    a large variation in growth rates, with actual output sharply surpassing potential in boom periods and significantly&#13;
    below during recessions. This is consistent with volatile economic and security conditions in the country, which has&#13;
    been subject to a high frequency of large shocks. In the early nineties, and following the end of the civil war, Lebanon&#13;
    witnessed a reconstruction program, which generated robust growth rates. This was followed by a prolonged slack&#13;
    in economic activity, such that by 1999, the positive output gap that had persisted during the nineties reverted to&#13;
    zero. The enduring economic slack, however, led to an increasingly negative cumulative gap, until 2007, when a high&#13;
    growth period ensued until 2010.&#13;
    The regional turmoil starting in 2011 was felt strongly in Lebanon, causing sluggish economy activity. All methods&#13;
    indicate that the large positive output gap that existed in 2010 starts narrowing in 2011 and closes by 2014 (Figure&#13;
    2). In fact, the output gap even turned slightly negative in 2014 with estimates from the different methods ranging&#13;
    from -0.51 percent to -1.02 percent of potential output. The very large negative cumulative output gap that existed&#13;
    over the period 2000-2008 has significantly narrowed and virtually closed by end-2014 (Figure 3). Estimates of the&#13;
    cumulative output gap over the period 2000-2014 range from -2,749 to 1,084 billion LBP, with an average of -725&#13;
    billion LBP across the four estimation methods.&#13;

a new strategy in 2013 aimed at expanding health&#13;
coverage to the uninsured. The strategy has been&#13;
put into practice in 2015 through the Universal                      Final note&#13;

poverty-targeted social assistance program for the poorest and&#13;
most vulnerable Lebanese families. To date, approximately            services. However, considering the current&#13;

efficiency of spending and eliminating waste. Primary&#13;
health care reforms through the UHC program,&#13;
if well implemented, can shift the composition of&#13;
spending toward prevention of diseases, helping to&#13;
contain costs in the future.&#13;
&#13;
68.	    Fast tracking pharmaceutical reforms is&#13;
also key, given the financial and fiscal importance&#13;
medicines have in the overall funding of services.&#13;
Implementing cost control through the use of generic&#13;
drugs is a good first step in that direction.&#13;
&#13;
69.	     Careful planning is crucial for moving&#13;
the UHC program to the second stage of&#13;
implementation, which may include expanding&#13;
service coverage as well as population coverage&#13;
to reach the informal sector. This will entail&#13;
expanding prepayment schemes, increasing the&#13;
efficiency of revenue collection and encouraging&#13;
risk pooling and coordination. As such, extensive&#13;
policy analysis and key policy questions will have to&#13;
be addressedâ&#128;&#149;who should pay and how much, what&#13;
type of fund is most appropriate (public, private) and&#13;
whether contribution should be made mandatory.&#13;
Strengthening the public health insurance system&#13;
through the harmonization of public pooling&#13;
arrangements (e.g.; MoPH, NSSF) will also need to&#13;
be considered and carefully examined.&#13;

and policy makers alike. In contrast to the BdL-CI,&#13;
the WB-CI points to a deceleration in economic&#13;
activity during the first ten months of 2013, which,&#13;
if sustained over a few more months, would warrant&#13;
a different monetary policy stance than the one&#13;
based on the BdL-CI. This monetary policy example&#13;
highlights the critical importance of having accurate,&#13;
high frequency, and timely economic indicators.&#13;

            The Lebanon Economic Monitor provides an
            update on key economic developments and policies over the
            past six months. It also presents findings from recent World
            Bank work on Lebanon. It places them in a longer-term and
            global context, and assesses the implications of these
            developments and other changes in policy on the outlook for
            Lebanon. Its coverage ranges from the macro-economy to
            financial markets to indicators of human welfare and
            development. It is intended for a wide audience, including
            policy makers, business leaders, financial market
            participants, and the community of analysts and
            professionals engaged in Lebanon.
