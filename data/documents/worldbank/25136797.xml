&#13;
&#13;
R   ussiaâ&#128;&#153;s recession deepened in the first half of&#13;
    2015 with a severe impact on households. The&#13;
economy continues to adjust to the 2014 terms-&#13;
                                                       contained systemic risks, and there are early signs&#13;
                                                       of stabilization. Nevertheless, the pass-through&#13;
                                                       effect of the December 2014 depreciation&#13;
of-trade shock amid a tense geopolitical context       boosted inflation to levels not seen since 2002.&#13;
marked by ongoing international sanctions.             Even as the recession deepened in the first half&#13;
Oil and gas prices remained low through the            of 2015 controlling inflation became the central&#13;
first half of 2015, further underscoring Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s      bankâ&#128;&#153;s main policy challenge. Low oil prices&#13;
vulnerability to volatile global commodity             continue to put downward pressure on federal&#13;
markets. The weakening of the ruble created a          revenue, ushering in a period of difficult fiscal&#13;
price advantage for some industries, boosting          consolidation. Real public spending is expected&#13;
a narrow range of exports and encouraging              to fall by 5 percent in 2015, notwithstanding a&#13;
investment in a certain sectors, but this was          temporary increase in the first half of the year&#13;
not sufficient to generate an overall increase         caused by frontloaded expenditures as part&#13;
in non-energy exports. Investment demand               of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s anti-crisis plan to cushion&#13;
continued to contract for a third consecutive          some of the fiscal consolidation impact. Falling&#13;
year. Economic policy uncertainty arising from         oil revenues constrained the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
an unpredictable geopolitical situation and the        ability to counter the decline in real income,&#13;
continuation of the sanctions regime caused            and nominal increases in pensions and social&#13;
private investment to decline rapidly ascapital        benefits were below the headline inflation rate.&#13;
costs rose and consumer demand evaporated.             This accelerated an already troubling rise in the&#13;
The record drop in consumer demand was driven          poverty rate, which climbed from 13.1 percent&#13;
by a sharp contraction in real wages, which fell by    in the first half of 2014 to 15.1 percent in the&#13;
an average of 8.5 percent in the first six months      first half of 2015.&#13;
of 2015, illustrating the severity of the recession.&#13;
However, the deterioration of real wages was           Adverse external conditions pose a serious&#13;
also the primary mechanism through which the           challenge to short-term growth prospects. Yet,&#13;
labor market adjusted to lower demand, and             high policy uncertainty prevails and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
unemployment increased only slightly from 5.3          outlook hinges not only on the evolution of&#13;
percent in 2014 to 5.6 percent in the first half       external factors but also on its internal capacity&#13;
of 2015. The erosion of real income significantly      to adapt to an increasingly difficult macro-fiscal&#13;
increased the poverty rate and exacerbated             context. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s baseline scenario&#13;
the vulnerability of households in the lower 40        anticipates contractions of 3.8 percent in 2015&#13;
percent of the income distribution.                    and 0.6 percent in 2016 before the economy&#13;
                                                       recovers to a modest growth rate of 1.5 percent&#13;
The policy response by the authorities                 in 2017. Given serious concerns regarding oil-&#13;
successfully stabilized the economy. The               price volatility, compounded by major downside&#13;
transition to a free-floating exchange rate            risks to the global economic outlook, this report&#13;
allowed imports to adjust to a 17 percent              presents upper-bound and lower-bound oil&#13;
depreciation in the real effective exchange rate       price scenarios along with the baseline. In the&#13;
during the first half of 2015, strengthening the       lower-bound scenario, in which oil prices fall&#13;
current-account balance. Meanwhile, measures           well below the baseline projection, real GDP&#13;
to support the financial sector appear to have         could contract by as much as 4.3 percent in 2015&#13;

zero growth in 2017. Even in the upper-bound          structural transformation of the Russian&#13;
scenario, in which oil prices recover, real GDP       economy.&#13;

Recent Economic Developments:&#13;
Weathering the Storm&#13;
R   ussiaâ&#128;&#153;s recession deepened in the first half of this year, as the ongoing contraction in domestic&#13;
    demand accelerated. The economy continues to ride the waves of the 2014 terms-of-trade shock&#13;
and the implications of geopolitical tensions and continuing international sanctions. Oil and gas&#13;
prices remained low through the first half of 2015, further underscoring Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to&#13;
global commodity markets. However, imports adjusted to reflect the depreciation of the real effective&#13;
exchange rate, as the Central Bank of Russia successfully transitioned to a free float, which eased&#13;
pressure on Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s external balances. Meanwhile, measures to support the financial sector appear to&#13;
have contained systemic risks, and there are early signs of stabilization. Nevertheless, the pass-through&#13;
effect of the December 2014 depreciation boosted inflation to levels not seen since 2002. Despite the&#13;
deepening recession, controlling inflation became the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s main policy challenge in the first&#13;
half of 2015 as double-digit inflation rates eroded real wages and incomes. Real wage and income&#13;
trends illustrate the depth of the recession and its negative impact on household consumption, which&#13;
has dropped at a record pace. The decline in real wages was also the primary mechanism through&#13;
which the labor market adjusted to lower demand, and unemployment increased only slightly. The&#13;
decline in real incomes increased poverty rates and exacerbated the vulnerability of households in the&#13;
bottom 40 percent of the income distribution.&#13;

1.1 Growth&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recession, which officially began in the fourth quarter of 2014, deepened significantly in the&#13;
first half of this year. Consumer demand dropped at a record pace as double-digit inflation eroded&#13;
real wages and incomes. Meanwhile, continued policy uncertainty, a weak domestic market, and&#13;
high capital costs prompted a sharp contraction in investment.&#13;

                                                                                   marginally to an average of just over US$62 per&#13;

&amp;#12;I. Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 1            Global economic trends&#13;
  Global growth in the second quarter of 2015 was boosted by a moderate recovery in high-income countries. Following&#13;
  a sluggish first quarter, the US economy expanded by 2.3 percent in the second quarter. The US continues to show signs&#13;
  of an accelerating recovery, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in July, its lowest level since April 2008. The&#13;
  US Federal Reserve is expected to begin gradually raising interest rates in the coming months, though the exact timing&#13;
  of any prospective increase remains uncertain. The renewed strength of the dollar could dampen export growth and&#13;
  slow an expected rise in core inflation. Euro zone growth reached 1.5 percent in quarter one and 1.2 percent in quarter&#13;
  two despite the uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt crisis. Albeit modest, this is the euro zoneâ&#128;&#153;s best semi-annual&#13;
  growth performance since 2012. Growth was supported by the European Central Bankâ&#128;&#153;s quantitative easing program,&#13;
  which helped improve credit conditions, weakened the euro, and reduced contagion risks associated with Greek debt. Low&#13;
  oil prices and the tapering of fiscal consolidation policies continue to support the euro zoneâ&#128;&#153;s recovery.&#13;
&#13;
  Growth is expected to slow in major emerging markets and most developing countries. High-frequency indicators&#13;
  suggest that emerging marketsâ&#128;&#153; poor quarter one performance has extended into quarter two. Industrial production in a&#13;
  number of high- and middle-income countries is either struggling to gain momentum (Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia and&#13;
  Malaysia) or slowing (Brazil, Russia, the Philippines, Korea and Thailand).Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for July&#13;
  indicate further softness in the global secondary sector (Figure 3). A number of oil exporters (Russia, Colombia, Nigeria,&#13;
  Venezuela and Malaysia) are under acute pressure from deteriorating terms of trade, while countries that rely on non-&#13;
  energy commodity exports (Argentina, Indonesia, Chile, Peru, South Africa and Zambia) also face an adverse external&#13;
  environment. By contrast, Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery appears to remain robust, although growth is expected to slow somewhat&#13;
  following an exceptionally strong quarter one. In China,quarter two growth was in line with World Bank projections at&#13;
  7 percent, year-on-year, as stimulus measures mitigated the slowdown. However, manufacturing activity continued to&#13;
  decelerate;the July PMI deteriorated further, and exports and imports contracted significantly in Julyâ&#128;&#148;both falling by over&#13;
  8 percent from a year earlier.&#13;
&#13;
  Global financing and exchange-rate pressures are building. Market risk aversion increased as a result of the Greek debt&#13;
  crisis, the collapse of Chinese equity prices, the depreciation of the renminbi, and the persistent weakness of commodity&#13;
  prices, all of which are putting upward pressure on borrowing conditions in emerging markets (Figure 4). The EMBI&#13;
  global sovereign bond spread has widened by 40 basis points since mid-May, especially for oil and other commodity&#13;
  exporters. However, the rise in borrowing costs has been more modest than it was during either the oil price collapse in&#13;
  2014, or the so-called â&#128;&#156;taper tantrumâ&#128;&#157; in 2013. Currency pressures have intensified. Since June,the currencies of Russia,&#13;
  Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Malaysia have all depreciated by more than 10 percent against the US dollar, due largely to&#13;
  weak commodity prices.&#13;

Box 2        Energy price trends&#13;
    Low energy prices continued from the first half of 2015 into the third quarter. Oil prices dropped to almost US$40 per&#13;
    barrel in late August, their lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis (Figure 5). The decline reflects an oversupplied global&#13;
    market, in part reflecting the resilience of US shale oil production despite large reductions in investment and drilling&#13;
    since October 2014. OPEC oil production continues to climb, rising by almost half a million barrels per day since May.&#13;
    Both Saudi Arabia and Iraq recently reached record production levels at 10.4 and 4.2 million barrels per day, respectively.&#13;
    The multilateral agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, if ratified, could increase Iranian oil exports by 0.5 million&#13;
    barrels per day by 2016. Global oil demand has responded positively to lower prices, and the International Energy Agency&#13;
    projects that demand will grow by 1.6 million barrels per day in 2016, the fastest pace in five years. However, there are&#13;
    concerns that slowing growth in Chinaâ&#128;&#148;the worldâ&#128;&#153;s second largest oil consumerâ&#128;&#148;will prolong the surplus. Other sources&#13;
    of downward pressure on oil prices include a strong US dollar and continuously high OECD oil inventories.&#13;

    Until 2014, the rapid expansion of shale oil production in the United States was offset almost barrel-for-barrel by&#13;
    supply shortfalls in the Middle East and North Africa. The rapid growth of US oil production, combined with the partial&#13;
    resumption of supply from Libya and record output from Iraq, created a glut in the global oil market (Figure 6). In the past,&#13;
    a well-supplied oil market would be countered by OPECâ&#128;&#148;and especially Saudi Arabia, OPECâ&#128;&#153;s largest producerâ&#128;&#148;which&#13;
    would move to constrain global oil supply. However, in the fall of 2014, OPEC decided not to engage in any form of supply&#13;
    management in order to protect its market share. This decision has led to the largest supply-driven price correction since&#13;
    1986. Only twice have drops in oil prices of similar magnitude occurred in the recent past: just after the first Gulf War,&#13;
    when supply rebounded following a shock, and during the 2008 financial crisis, as demand among major economies&#13;
    temporarily dropped.&#13;

Box 3                Trends in business and consumer confidence&#13;
    Business confidence deteriorated during the first half of 2015 due to weak domestic demand and continued policy&#13;
    uncertainty. Rosstatâ&#128;&#153;s Producer Confidence Index and HSBCâ&#128;&#153;s PMI both indicated that business confidence in the&#13;
    manufacturing sector declined further since last year (Figure 9). For example, the Rosstat manufacturing index averaged&#13;
    â&#128;&#147;6.3 in the first half of 2015, down from â&#128;&#147;3.3 in the first half of 2014. A similar trend was observed in the resource&#13;
    sector, where the average index dropped from -1.5 to -4.5 over the same period. The Rosstat survey also revealed that&#13;
    weak domestic demand and policy uncertainty were the two most important factors that negatively affected business&#13;
    confidence in the first half of 2015 (Figure 10). The importance of policy uncertainty rose sharply in 2015, with about half&#13;
    of all respondents citing it as a significant constraint to doing business, compared to 34 percent in 2014. Both the PMI and&#13;
    the Rosstat surveys continue to rank weak domestic demand as the most frequently cited constraint.&#13;
&#13;
    Consumer confidence also sharply deteriorated in the first quarter of 2015, yet it showed signs of rebounding in&#13;
    the second quarter. Rosstatâ&#128;&#153;s consumer confidence index dropped from -11 in the first quarter of 2014 to -32 in the&#13;
    first quarter of 2015, close to the record low of -35 registered in Q1 of 2009. However, consumer confidence improved&#13;
    somewhat in the second quarter, though high-frequency statistics have not yet shown any improvement in consumption.&#13;
    The rubleâ&#128;&#153;s stabilization and appreciation in mid-May and the slowdown in inflation observed since April may have&#13;
    bolstered consumer confidence.&#13;

Box 4            The effect of the REER adjustment on Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tradable sector&#13;
    The positive impact of the rubleâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation on Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tradable sector has been so far limited and uneven. The&#13;
    REERâ&#128;&#153;s sharp drop in the first quarter created a price advantage for the tradable sector. This boosted output and exports&#13;
    in a few selected sectors, spurred investment (Figure 12) and marginally increased employment (Figure 13). Mineral&#13;
    extraction and chemical production grew significantly, while agricultural output and foodstuff production were supported&#13;
    not only by the depreciation, but also by Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ban on food imports. However, the relative improvement in prices did&#13;
    not significantly impact output or exports for most of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing sector, and many of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s industrial&#13;
    products remained uncompetitive on international markets. Indeed, overall manufacturing output contracted by 2.0&#13;
    percent in the first half of 2015, whereas it had grown by 3.5 percent over the same period in 2014 (Figure 14). Investment&#13;
    data confirm the limited degree of natural substitution to date in Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tradable sector. Investment increased in the&#13;
    chemicals, rubber, plastics, electronics and machine-building industries, presenting cause for cautious optimism.&#13;
&#13;
    Despite the modestly positive effects from the REER adjustment, during the first half of 2015 the tradable sector&#13;
    contributed negatively to growth for the first time since 2009. The decline of the tradable sector trimmed total output by&#13;
    0.1 percentage points during the first half of 2015. However, a far worse performance by the nontradable sector drove the&#13;
    contraction in GDP, as consumer demand dropped sharply, cutting 3.1 percentage points from overall growth in the first&#13;
    half of the year (Figure 15). Retail and wholesale tradeâ&#128;&#148;the Russian economyâ&#128;&#153;s largest sectorâ&#128;&#148;contracted by 9.3 percent,&#13;
    year-on-year, in the first half of 2015 after growing by an anemic 0.6 percent in the first half of 2014. The financial sector,&#13;
    a key driver of growth in recent years, contracted by 4.5 percent in the first half of 2015 after growing by 11.2 percent&#13;
    during the same period in the previous year.&#13;

1.2 Balance of Payments&#13;
Despite the worsening external environment, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s current account remained in surplus, and the&#13;
vulnerability of its balance of payments decreased as imports adjusted to reflect the depreciation&#13;
of the REER. Deleveraging continued at a rapid pace as economic sanctions limited access to&#13;
international financial markets. However, capital outflows moderated as the private sector sharply&#13;
reduced its net acquisition of foreign assets.&#13;

    Box 5          Remittance trends&#13;
     The rubleâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation significantly reduced remittance outflows in the first quarter of 2015. Outbound remittances&#13;
     declined by 42 percent, year-on-year, to US$3.38 billion. 73 percent of remittances went to CIS countries, including&#13;
     Uzbekistan (US$634 million), Tajikistan (US$434 million), Ukraine (US$377 million), the Kyrgyz Republic (US$284 million),&#13;
     and Armenia (US$207 million) (Figure 20). Remittance inflows during the same period totaled US$1.65 billion, down 5&#13;
     percent from a year ago. Of these, CIS countries accounted for 34.1 percent of total remittance inflows, led by Kazakhstan&#13;
     (US$215 million) and Uzbekistan (US$105 million) (Figure 21).&#13;

1.3 Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector&#13;
Despite the deepening recession, controlling runaway inflation became the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s most critical&#13;
policy challenge during the first half of 2015. The pass-through effect of the rubleâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation in&#13;
December 2014 pushed inflation to levels not seen since 2002. Due to persistently high inflation,&#13;
the central bank gradually moderated the monetary easing cycle it had started in early 2015 and&#13;
discontinued it in September. Measures to support the financial sector appear to have contained&#13;
systemic risks, and there are early signs of stabilization. The central bank successfully transitioned to&#13;
a free-floating exchange rate, but in May it resumed marginal interventions to replenish its foreign-&#13;
currency reserves.&#13;

December 2014 and started a monetary easing                         High inflation rates combined with negative&#13;
cycle in January. However, due to the pass-                         growth presented a serious monetary policy&#13;

core inflation uninterruptedly outpaced headline                    its monetary easing cycle. This cycle began on&#13;

year-on-year, following an increase of 15.4                         restored (Figure 25). As inflation began to slowly&#13;

 April, prompting the central bank to increase the rate on Source: Haver Analytics and CBR.&#13;
 foreign currency repos on April 10 and again on April 20.&#13;
 The reduction in key policy rates by 150 basis points at the end of April and the cancellation and discontinuation of the&#13;
 1-year foreign-exchange repo facilities improved the exchange rateâ&#128;&#153;s alignment with oil prices. The central bankâ&#128;&#153;s daily&#13;
 purchases of US$200 million, which began on May 15, led to some temporary volatility in the foreign-exchange market,&#13;
 but in the second half of June the alignment between the ruble and oil prices was restored. In July, a renewed decline in oil&#13;
 prices intensified depreciation pressures, while large external debt payments and the start of the tourist season increased&#13;
 demand for dollars, prompting the central bank to postpone further foreign-exchange purchases.&#13;

    	 At the end of December 2014, the government began the RUB1.0 trillion recapitalization program through issuing treasury bonds to be&#13;
      invested in the capital of systemically important banks. At the same time, the State Duma approved the law allowing investing up to 10&#13;
      percent of the National Wealth Fund in subordinated deposits and bonds of Russian banks. On May 13, 2015, the government approved&#13;

1.4 The Government Budget&#13;
The Russian government is facing a fiscal consolidation challenge. The federal budget balance&#13;
weakened during the first half of 2015 as revenues dropped and expenditures increased in real terms.&#13;
The officially projected federal deficit of 3.7 percent is being financed primarily by the Reserve Fund,&#13;
which will deplete its resources by an estimated 50 percent by end-2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
L  ow oil prices have exerted substantial&#13;
   downward pressure on federal revenues over&#13;
the past seven months. Overall federal revenues&#13;
                                                                                         Real federal public spending rose in the first&#13;
                                                                                         seven months of 2015 due to expenditure&#13;
                                                                                         frontloading and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s anti-crisis&#13;

2015 as oil and gas revenues decreased from                                              government expenditure priorities favored&#13;
10.8 percent of GDP to 8.6 percent, year-on-year                                         national defense and social programs, and&#13;
(Figure 29). The average Urals oil price dropped                                         spending in these categories rose by 34.8 percent&#13;
from US$107 per barrel in the first half of 2014                                         and 26.5 percent, year-on-year, respectively.&#13;
to just under US$57 in the first half of 2015,                                           Meanwhile, economic subsidies increased by&#13;
prompting the government to sharply revise                                               24.7 percent, year-on-year. This was part of the&#13;
the oil-price assumption underpinning the 2015                                           governmentâ&#128;&#153;s anti-crisis plan which aimed to&#13;

US$100 per barrel. Higher one-off VAT receipts                                           However, total primary expenditures are&#13;

Box 7      Amendments to the 2015 Federal Budget&#13;
  The Ministry of Finance produced a draft 2015 budget and a prospective 2016â&#128;&#147;2017 budget in mid-2014, before the&#13;
  full impact of the recent terms-of-trade shocks had registered. Federal budget projections were based on an anticipated&#13;
  average oil price of US$100 per barrel. By the end of the year, when the oil price had dipped to US$70 per barrel, the&#13;
  government decided to delay the adjustment of budget parameters. As a result, the budget that took effect in December&#13;
  2014 was based on outdated price projections and an obsolete macro-fiscal framework. The government began adjusting&#13;
  the budget during the first quarter of 2015, and on April 20 it was amended to reflect the new macroeconomic context.&#13;
  However, these amendments only apply to the 2015 federal budget, and the prospective 2016 and 2017 budgets remain&#13;
  unchanged.&#13;
&#13;
  In August, the Ministry of Finance decided to continue its one-year planning horizon through 2016. Consequently,&#13;
  there is no medium-term budget perspective to guide federal agencies, increasing policy uncertainty. The same situation&#13;
  occurred during the 2008 global financial crisis, when the government abandoned medium-term budgeting. The amended&#13;
  budget halves the expected average oil price to US$50 per barrel and revises GDP growth downward from 1.2 percent to&#13;
  negative 3 percent. Meanwhile, estimates of CPI inflation and exchange-rate depreciation rose from 5.5 to 12.2 percent&#13;
  and from 37.8 to 61.5 percent, respectively.&#13;

    Box 8       The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s anti-crisis plan and its implementation&#13;
     On January 27, 2014 the government adopted an anti-crisis plan totaling RUB2.4 trillion. The bulk of the plan was designed to support&#13;
     the financial sector, but other parts of the economy, as well as regional budgets and social programs, were also targeted (Figure 31). The&#13;
     plan was to be financed by Treasury bonds issued in December to recapitalize the financial sector, along with resources from the 2015&#13;
     budget and the NWF (Figure 32).&#13;
&#13;
     About 67 percent of the planâ&#128;&#153;s funds were earmarked for bank recapitalization. Treasury bonds worth RUB1 trillion were transferred to&#13;
     the Deposit Insurance Agency in December 2014, and 28 banks7 are currently eligible for recapitalization. In order to qualify, banks were&#13;
     required to commit to increasing mortgages, loans to small and medium enterprises, loans to regional budgets or loans to key economic&#13;
     sectors by 1 percent per month over the next three years, and to increase their own capital by at least half of the amount received from&#13;
     the Deposit Insurance Agency. Banks were also required to implement a three-year wage freeze. As of September, eleven banks8 had been&#13;
     recapitalized at a total cost of RUB598.5 billion. In August the government approved a list of regional banks9 to be recapitalized in the&#13;
     amount of RUB 8.5 billion through the Rossiisky Capital Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     The RUB1 trillion originally allocated to support commercial banks was reduced by RUB162 billion, which the government redirected&#13;
     to support state-owned companies. Federal bonds in the amount of RUB100 billion were transferred to the state-owned company United&#13;
     Airconstruction. The State Transport Leasing Company received RUB30 billion in federal bonds, and the state-owned energy company&#13;
     Lenenergo received RUB32 billion.10&#13;
&#13;
     The NWF is investing up to RUB250 billion in subordinated deposits and bonds in systemically important banks that have capital assets&#13;
     of at least RUB100 billion (US$1.6 billion). In October 2014, nine banks met these criteria. The interest rate on these deposits will at least&#13;
     equal the CPI inflation rate. Banks that receive deposits from the fund are expected to finance government-approved investment projects.&#13;
     As of September, RUB 64.4 billion in fund assets had been deposited into commercial banks. In March, RUB 26 billion was deposited in&#13;
     the state-owned bank VTB to finance infrastructure projects. In April, the government deposited RUB38.4 billion in the state-owned&#13;
     Gazprombank to finance the construction of the new Central Ring Road. Finally, the government plans to deposit an additional RUB300 in&#13;
     the NWF resources in the state-owned Vnesheconombank to provide credit to the economy, but this transaction has not yet taken place.&#13;
&#13;
     About 13.9 percent of the anti-crisis planâ&#128;&#153;s funding (RUB320 billion) was earmarked for direct support to the economy. This includes&#13;
     RUB200 billion in state guarantees for systemically important companies, RUB50 billion to support agricultural enterprises and RUB10&#13;
     billion to support the transportation sector. The government has approved a list of 199 firms eligible for state guarantees, which includes&#13;
     all major Russian companies. The firms on the list together produce about 70 percent of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP. In September, RUB17 billion in&#13;
     state guarantees were issued to the state-owned company Uralvagonzvod.11 In the first seven months of 2015 federal spending on the&#13;
     agricultural sector reached RUB124.4 billion (59.6 percent of the budgeted amount), up 50 percent from the previous year.&#13;
&#13;
     Another 12.9 percent of the anti-crisis planâ&#128;&#153;s resources (RUB296 billion) was earmarked for social support. This includes RUB188&#13;
     billion to offset the decline in real pension payments, up to RUB52.2 billion for labor market policies, RUB30 billion for unemployment&#13;
     compensation, and RUB16 billion for the health sector. The government increased labor pensions by 11.4 percent in February and&#13;
     social pensions by 10.3 percent in April. During the first seven months the government also distributed 83 percent of the RUB2.5&#13;
     billion in regional subsidies earmarked for labor market policies and RUB25.9 billion in regional transfers earmarked for unemployment&#13;
     compensation, 68 percent of the budgeted amount.&#13;
&#13;
     About 7.0 percent (RUB160 billion) of the planâ&#128;&#153;s resources are to be transferred to regional governments through budgetary&#13;
     loans. As of August, budgetary loans to regional governments increased by RUB123.5 billion to a total of RUB771 billion.&#13;

its original purpose. For that to happen, however,              population (see Part III). Without major reforms&#13;
&#13;
Box 9     Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal rule&#13;
  In 2012, the government introduced an oil-priceâ&#128;&#147;based fiscal rule to manage its revenues from natural resources more&#13;
  effectively. Before 2012, the fiscal tool to guide resource-based spending was a 4.7 percent target for the nonoil budget&#13;
  deficit. The new rule establishes a benchmark price based on a backward-looking moving average of actual Urals oil&#13;
  prices, which is used to calculate how much of a given yearâ&#128;&#153;s resource revenues can be devoted to public spending. The&#13;
  benchmark price is equal to the average price of the previous three years, but only if oil prices have been decreasing&#13;
  for more than three consecutive years. If prices have not consistently decreased, then the benchmark price is equal&#13;
  to the average price for the previous 10 years. If actual oil prices are above the benchmark price in a given year, the&#13;
  difference is saved, and if they are lower than the benchmark price, previous savings are used to finance the difference.&#13;
  Savings are managed through a two-tier institutional structure. Initial savings are deposited into the Reserve Fund; once&#13;
  the Reserve Fund balance reaches 7 percent of GDP, half of all additional savings are allocated to the NWF and half to&#13;
  infrastructure projects. Balances in the NWF are earmarked for future pension liabilities and in the latter are used for&#13;
  current infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
  In principle, this mechanism stabilizes public spending through the buffers deposited in the Reserve Fund and saved&#13;
  for future generations through the National Wealth Fund. The fiscal rule and two-tier sovereign wealth funds savings&#13;
  mechanism could effectively smooth revenue volatility that would otherwise be transferred from natural resource prices&#13;
  to public spending. However, the government is currently planning to use savings from the Reserve Fund to finance&#13;
  budget deficits over the next one-to-three years and has committed much of the NWF. This is a serious concern, as the&#13;
  simulations presented in Annex 1 show that over the long run NWF resources will not be adequate to cover the fiscal&#13;
  deficits generated by the aging of the Russian population.&#13;

Subnational budgets are less vulnerable to                            end-2015. Subnational debts currently total 3.3&#13;
external shocks, because most oil revenues                            percent of GDP, up from 2.4 percent in the first&#13;
flow through the federal level. As of end-June,                       half of 2014. Subnational indebtedness could&#13;
the aggregate subnational budget registered a                         increase if the anticipated deficit is financed&#13;
surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP, yet this is expected                   through domestic borrowing in an environment&#13;
to become a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP by                          of high interest rates.&#13;

1.5 Income and Poverty Trends&#13;
The dramatic contraction in real wages and income observed in the first half of 2015 illustrates&#13;
the depth of the recession and its negative impact on household consumption. The decline in real&#13;
wages was the main channel through which the labor market adjusted to lower demand, and as a&#13;
result unemployment increased only slightly during the past year. However, the drop in real income&#13;
significantly increased poverty rates and exacerbated the vulnerability of households in the lower 40&#13;
percent of the income distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
R   eal wages have tumbled since the recession&#13;
    began, as inflation spiked while labor&#13;
demand receded. In the first six months of 2015&#13;
                                                                      for public sector wages while inflation remained&#13;
                                                                      in double-digits throughout the first half of the&#13;
                                                                      year. Civil servants comprise a large part of the&#13;
real wages fell across all sectors of the economy                     Russian middle class, and as their real wages&#13;

percent. This contraction followed a growth rate                      private consumption dropped rapidly.&#13;
of 3.4 percent in the first half of 2014. As lower&#13;
oil prices increased fiscal constraints the budget                    The decline in real wages enabled the labor&#13;
could not support the continued growth of public                      market to adjust without shedding a large&#13;
sector wages at the pace observed in 2012-                            number of jobs. As a result, the unemployment&#13;

Box 10 Labor market trends&#13;
      Labor demand started to decline in the first half of 2015. As the economy contracted the vacancy rate dropped to&#13;
      2.5 percent, year-on-year (Figure 35). Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose from 5.3 to 5.6 percent, representing&#13;
      an additional 200,000 unemployed workers. Although the labor supply has declined gradually since 2012, due to the&#13;
      aging of the population, the employment ratio has remained close to 65 percent (Figure 36). Male unemployment,&#13;
      at 6.0 percent, exceeds female unemployment, at 5.3 percent, up slightly from 5.7 and 4.8 percent in 2014. Urban&#13;
      unemployment increased from 4.4 percent to 5.0 percent, year-on-year, while rural unemployment decreased from 8.2&#13;
      percent to 7.9 percent.&#13;

      Russia has a long history of making labor-market adjustments through wage corrections, and several other factors have&#13;
      contributed to its low unemployment rate. A slightly higher degree of labor mobility facilitated the reallocation of human&#13;
      resources to expanding sectors, while public employmentâ&#128;&#148;particularly in public administration, education and state-&#13;
      owned enterprisesâ&#128;&#148;also appears to have increased. Meanwhile, the partial replacement of migrant workers by domestic&#13;
      workers in sectors such as construction and agriculture&#13;
      helped contain unemployment. Tajikistan, Uzbekistan&#13;
      and Moldova have all reported an increase in the number Figure 37: Foreign citizens residing in the Russian Federation&#13;

Economic Outlook:&#13;
High Uncertainty Prevails&#13;
A    dverse external conditions pose a serious challenge to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s short-term growth prospects. The&#13;
     continued impact of the adjustment to lower oil prices in a context of ongoing international sanctions&#13;
will cause the Russian economy to contract in 2015. Medium-term growth prospects depend on how&#13;
Russia will brave the difficult adjustment to this new economic reality, but high policy uncertainty prevails.&#13;
In the longer term, there is an opportunity for Russia to benefit from a structural transformation of its&#13;
economy. The baseline scenario anticipates a contraction of 3.8 percent in 2015 and 0.6 percent in 2016,&#13;
before the economy rebounds to a modest growth rate of 1.5 percent in 2017. Given renewed concerns&#13;
regarding oil-price volatility compounded by downside risks to the global economic outlook, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
upper-bound and lower-bound oil price scenarios differ markedly. For projections purposes, it is assumed&#13;
that sanctions remain in force in all three projection scenarios. The continuing macro-fiscal adjustment&#13;
process heightens risks related to financial stability and fiscal sustainability. Due to the severity of the&#13;
projected contraction and the vulnerability of lower-income households to growth shocks, poverty rates&#13;
are projected to increase sharply.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.1 Growth and Poverty Dynamics&#13;
Given the volatility of the international oil market and Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic sensitivity to changes in oil&#13;
prices, the World Bank has based its medium-term growth projections around three scenarios: the&#13;
baseline, an upper-bound oil price scenario, and a lower-bound oil price scenario. For projections&#13;
purposes it is assumed that sanctions remain in force in all three projection scenarios. The current&#13;
recession is expected to substantially reverse recent progress in poverty reduction, and poverty levels&#13;
are projected to increase sharply in all scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A    combination of persistently low global oil&#13;
     prices and ongoing international sanctions&#13;
is exerting a profoundly negative influence on&#13;
                                                                                   due to the tight domestic credit market and&#13;
                                                                                   international financial restrictions, borrowing&#13;
                                                                                   would become prohibitively expensive for most&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth prospects. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s                                        investors and households.&#13;
baseline growth outlook for 2015 anticipates&#13;
that the Russian economy will contract by 3.8                                      Geopolitical tensions continue, and both&#13;

adjustment to lower oil prices in a sanctions                                      access to international financial markets&#13;
environment. Oil prices are projected to remain                                    suppressing investment and capital formation&#13;
at an average of US$53 per barrel in 2015,                                         rates through 2015. A slow and uneven global&#13;
unchanged from the 2015 price forecast used                                        recovery is marked by continued weaknesses&#13;

&amp;#12;II. Economic Outlook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 12 The global economic outlook&#13;
  Global growth is expected to strengthen gradually over the medium term, spurred by an accelerating recovery in&#13;
  high-income countries (Table 9). Low commodity prices and generally benign financial conditions (notwithstanding the&#13;
  expected tightening of US monetary policy) will support a continued increase in global economic activity. The recovery&#13;
  among high-income countries is expected to gather momentum, with aggregate growth rising from 1.8 percent in 2014 to&#13;
  an estimated 2 percent in 2015 and a projected average of 2.3 percent over 2016â&#128;&#147;17. Performance gaps between major&#13;
  economies will narrow in 2015-2016, as growth rates plateau in the United States while increasing in the euro zone and&#13;
  Japan. Global growth is expected to reach 2.8 percent in 2015, up slightly from 2014, before accelerating to 3.2 percent&#13;
  in 2016â&#128;&#147;2017.&#13;
&#13;
  Developing and emerging economies will continue to face a difficult economic environment. Tighter financial markets,&#13;
  slowing growth in China, continued weakness in commodity prices and a strong US dollar will all present significant&#13;
  challenges. The protracted slump in global commodity prices has especially negative implications for growth in developing&#13;
  countries, as commodities account for about one-third of their aggregate GDP. Slowing growth among developing&#13;
  countries has adverse spillover effects for Russia, which maintains close trade, finance and remittance links with a number&#13;
  of developing economies. Meanwhile, countries that rely heavily on foreign capital inflows may be negatively affected&#13;
  by rising borrowing costs as the US Federal Reserve raises its policy interest rates. In addition, many developing and&#13;
  emerging economies have experienced a structural economic slowdown as demographic change has lowered the growth&#13;
  rate of their working-age populations. Nevertheless, rising productivity in South and East Asia should continue to support&#13;
  rapid regional growth, though at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years. Overall, aggregate growth in developing&#13;
  countries is expected to slow to 4.4 percent in 2015 before rising to 5.4 percent by 2017.&#13;

&amp;#12;II. Economic Outlook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 13       Global Oil-Price Forecasts&#13;
  Robust supply growth coupled with slowing demand led to a substantial built-up in global oil inventories. OECD&#13;
  inventories exceeded 2.9 billion barrels in June, the highest level in recent history (Figure 46). Meanwhile, OPEC increased&#13;
  its output, as Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers attempted to protect their market shares. As a result, OPECâ&#128;&#153;s excess&#13;
  production capacity narrowed from 4.3 million barrel per day in March to 3.2 million barrel per day in August, down from&#13;
  almost 5 million barrels per day at end-2013. OPEC established this strategy of increasing output in the face of weak global&#13;
  demand at its November 2014 meeting and reaffirmed its commitment in June 2015. Sustained low oil prices could lead in&#13;
  the long-term to a readjustment in oil supply and increasing again the share of traditional oil producers.&#13;
&#13;
  The World Bank projects that oil prices will average US$53 per barrel in 2015,a 45 percent decrease from 2014. This&#13;
  projection assumes that OPEC will continue to refrain from any form of supply management (the next OPEC meeting will&#13;
  take place on December 4, 2015) and that there will be no further deterioration in the global economic environment. This&#13;
  forecast assumes the maintenance of OPECâ&#128;&#153;s current policy, the easing of geopolitical tensions, further supply increases&#13;
  (including rising oil exports from Iran), and moderate growth in global demand (Figure 47). These factors, combined with&#13;
  the extent of existing production capacityâ&#128;&#148;especially shale-oil output in the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;suggests that oil prices will&#13;
  remain low at an average of US$53 per barrel in 2016. Low oil prices have also impacted other energy markets, especially&#13;
  European and Asian markets for natural gas. These spillover effects have additional negative implications for Russian&#13;
  energy exports.&#13;

Box 14      Financial market restructuring options&#13;
 Certain recent banking crises have been marked by liquidity shortages that eventually caused bank failures even while&#13;
 underlying solvency positions remained satisfactory; the Russian situation, however, is essentially the reverse. The&#13;
 central bank and the government are providing ample liquidity support (while closing small unviable banks) and allowing&#13;
 banks to trade foreign exchange at favorable ruble rates. Russia has also set up its own internal version of the international&#13;
 SWIFT payment system. While these are important short-term stabilization measures they do not address underlying&#13;
 solvency issues, since the deterioration of asset values (due to lower lending rates, rising NPLs and diminished collateral&#13;
 value such as for real estate) will eventually erode statutory solvency margins. The central bank is currently exercising&#13;
 regulatory forbearance by not requiring that banks immediately recognize asset losses and the consequent decline in&#13;
 their solvency margins. However, without assets-generating returns bank profitability will eventually become negative, as&#13;
 indeed has already happened in some banks, as a rising stock of nonperforming assets will drain bank resources.&#13;
&#13;
 Three policy options can help to address this problem and restore the long-term health of the banking sector. These can&#13;
 be implemented individually or jointly by the central bank and the government:&#13;
   (i)	 Launch a bank-strengthening program under which a portion of the income earned by banks is allocated to loan-&#13;
          loss reserves for the next five years; this will prepare banks to write-off fully nonperforming assets and maintain&#13;
          sound balance sheets.&#13;
   (ii)	 Contract asset-management companies to transfer and manage bad loans from the sector, enabling them to earn&#13;
          fees for collecting on bad loans, which could be temporarily replaced on bank balance sheets with long term&#13;
          bonds. Such a scheme would need to be designed based on the probable receipt of sufficient returns on bad assets&#13;
          to pay for asset-management fees and cover at least some of the interest payable on the bonds, which can initially&#13;
          be low-yield and with advances provided by the government.&#13;
   (iii)	 Based their progress under the above programs during a period of at least two years the central bank should&#13;
          begin closing banks that are still considered unviable and insolvent, though creditors would suffer losses during&#13;
          liquidation.&#13;

T  he Russian Federation is undergoing a major demographic and economic transformation driven&#13;
   by a rapidly aging population and by the diminishing economic importance of the natural resource&#13;
sector. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s total population will shrink by an estimated 2 million people by 2050. At the same&#13;
time, the old-age dependency ratio will increase by more than 50 percent, from 0.4 retirees per active&#13;
worker to about 0.64. Meanwhile, the total output of the oil and gas sectors will remain broadly&#13;
stable, and as productivity in other economic sectors continues to grow, the role of natural resources&#13;
will diminish significantly in the decades to come. These trends will have important macroeconomic&#13;
and fiscal implications, as the changing size and composition of both the population and the real&#13;
economy will directly and indirectly impact the public finances. A narrowing base for income tax&#13;
collection and pension contributions will limit revenue inflows, while the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s social-policy&#13;
commitments will intensify expenditure pressures. An aging population can shift the demand for the&#13;
provision of public services in healthcare, long term care, and education, as well as changing the size&#13;
of transfers through the pension system.&#13;

end scenario is similar to Rosstatâ&#128;&#153;s baseline.&#13;
Moreover, the decline in the total population                               As Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s demographics continue to evolve,&#13;

3.2 The Growth Implications of Demographic Trends&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A     n aging population has an ambiguous effect&#13;
      on per capita output, which complicates&#13;
economic forecasting in Russia.16 The three&#13;
                                                                          expected to decline from about 75 million in&#13;
                                                                          2014 to about 64 million by 2050 (Figure 50A).&#13;
                                                                          In the low-end population scenario, the labor&#13;
most important and uncertain components of                                force plummets to 55 million, whereas in the&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP are (i) the size of the labor force,                         high-end scenario it diminishes modestly to 72&#13;
(ii) the marginal productivity of labor, and (iii)                        million.18 Other simulations explore the potential&#13;
natural resource prices, in particular oil prices.                        impact of government policies designed to&#13;
The simulations presented below draw on                                   increase labor-force participation (LFP).19 In&#13;
labor-force estimates by Balaev et al.17 In the                           the baseline scenario, these policies add about&#13;
baseline forecast, the size of the labor force is                         4 million participants to the labor force by&#13;
16&#13;
   	A decline in fertility reduces the number of workers and increases the inactive population relative to the workers (the dependency rate).&#13;
    Other things being equal, this could reduce per capita output. However, since a decline in fertility does not immediately affect workerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    incentives to save (unless institutional factors like a specific type of Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) social security system create such incentives),&#13;
    there are fewer workers, and each worker has access to more capital, so that labor productivity, and perhaps per capita output, rises.&#13;
    Similarly, an increase in longevity increases the number of inactive people, which alone would reduce per capita output. However, those who&#13;
    expect to live longer are likely to increase their savings to support consumption over a longer lifetime. These adjustments will increase the&#13;
    capital stock, thus increasing labor productivity, and moderate the decline in the number of workers, seeing the output per capita increase.&#13;
    Institutional factors will determine how aging affects the real economy in net terms. For example, a defined contribution pension system&#13;
    heightens incentives to save, which may increase capital per worker and therefore per capita output, while a defined benefit system would&#13;
    achieve the opposite, see Dedry, Onder, and Pestieau (2014) for a formal discussion on this.&#13;

    This employment forecast assumes that the 5 percent unemployment rate observed in 2013 reflected an economy at full capacity (IMF&#13;

    employment of disabled persons, and stepping-up measures to encourage female participation in the labor force by expanding access to&#13;

baseline scenario, oil prices stabilize at around                         2018 and then moderates to 1.6 percent over the&#13;

  	The short-term projections for oil prices and other variables are different in this part from the rest of the document report as the underlying&#13;
    research was finalized in 2014.&#13;
21	&#13;
    It should be noted that a low-end demographic scenario could increase per capita income, since the old-age dependency ratio is greatest in&#13;
    the high-end demography scenario.&#13;
22	&#13;
    A recent study by the Gaidar Institute (Goryunov et al. 2013) presents a similar projection.&#13;
23	&#13;
    For example, starting from the baseline it is possible to make projections using the high-end labor productivity scenario while keeping all&#13;
    others variables at their baseline levels. The resulting GDP projections can then be compared to the baseline scenario in terms of values and&#13;
    percentage deviations.&#13;

The share of natural resource revenues in                                     increase in non-resource GDP.24 Overall, primary&#13;
total fiscal revenues is projected to decline. In                             expenditures in all categories are expected to&#13;
the baseline scenario natural resource output                                 rise. By 2050, noninterest government spending&#13;
rises only slightly, as an expected increase in                               increases from 36.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to&#13;
natural gas production is offset by a drop in oil                             37.8 percent in the baseline scenario, or to 42.3&#13;
production and the stabilization of oil prices.                               percent in the pessimistic scenario, though it&#13;
As a result, the net increase in natural resource                             drops to 32.8 percent in the optimistic scenario&#13;
revenues fails to keep pace with the growth                                   (Figure 52E). Age-related spending rises in the&#13;

resource revenues in total fiscal revenues                                    total expenditures in 2014 to 49 percent in 2050&#13;
decreases from about 30 percent in 2014 to 14                                 (Figure 52). Education remains stable as a share&#13;

&#13;
A   combination of rising non-resource GDP and&#13;
    an aging population will significantly alter&#13;
expenditure patterns over time. In the baseline&#13;
                                                                              Public spending on education is projected to&#13;
                                                                              increase modestly in absolute terms, while&#13;

affected by demographics is expected to decline                               The projected increase in GDP is expected to&#13;
from 24.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 19.5 percent                              boost education expenditures (as richer citizens&#13;
by 2050 (Figure 52A). This pattern is based on                                typically demand better education quality),&#13;
the assumption that while public investments                                  though the number of young people would&#13;
often entail large initial costs, these costs do                              remain stable at around 23-26 million.25 In the&#13;
not necessarily grow in line with GDP. Age-                                   baseline scenario, public education spending&#13;
related spending categories such as education,                                increases from about 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014&#13;
healthcare and social security are affected both by                           to 4.3 percent in 2050 (Figure 52B). Education&#13;
the aging of the population and by the projected                              expenditures in the optimistic scenario begin&#13;
24&#13;
   	There is no empirical consensus regarding the size of income elasticities of demand for public services. Cross-country evidence usually&#13;
    suggests income elasticities above 1 for health care spending: Newhouse (1977) found an elasticity of 1.35 for 30 OECD countries and Leu&#13;
    (1986) found 1.2 for 19 OECD countries. A study by the European Commission (2012) used 1.3 to project healthcare expenditures. The&#13;
    simulations in this chapter use 1.2.&#13;
25&#13;
   	The number of young people does not decline significantly because the baseline scenario assumes that the fertility rate rebounds from 1.6&#13;
    percent in 2020 to 1.9 in 2050. Education spending may also rise in response to changing policy priorities.&#13;

   	Over the first decade of the forecast period, the non-resource sectorâ&#128;&#153;s share of GDP is greater in the pessimistic scenario, and education&#13;
    spending is also higher. Over time, the higher fertility rates in the optimistic scenario increase the number of young people, which boosts&#13;
    education spending.&#13;
27	&#13;
    The projected fiscal burden can vary significantly depending on the methodology used. The demographic approach assumes costs to track&#13;
    only changes in income and the number of people in different cohorts, while other studies indicate that healthcare costs mainly reflect&#13;
    proximity to death rather than nominal age. Therefore, increasing longevity may not necessarily drive up health care costs. Healthcare costs&#13;
    may also be affected by advances in medical technology. New treatment options could boost per capita health expenditures faster than&#13;
    income growth.&#13;
28&#13;
   	Russia has recently reformed its social security system, and these projections may vary if the new system parameters are used.&#13;
29	&#13;
    This demography approach holds worker contributions and recipient benefits constant as a share of per capita income. Different assumptions&#13;
    for economic growth and social security system characteristics can alter the simulations. For instance, a 2013 World Bank study using a more&#13;
    optimistic growth outlook found that Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s social security deficits could be held to low single digits if the average benefit of all current&#13;
    recipients were capped at half the average wage by 2050.&#13;

     	These simulations assume a 1 percent real interest rate on domestic debt and a 1.2 percent rate on external debt; in the baseline scenario&#13;
      GDP would grow by 2.5 percent annually. The debt-burden assumptions should therefore be regarded as conservative.&#13;

market policies may be costly and could add to&#13;
the short- and medium-term fiscal burden.&#13;
&#13;
 Box 15          The Chilean experience with fiscal rules and financing social security liabilities&#13;
      Achieving long-term fiscal sustainability in a context of profound demographic shifts may be costly in the short and&#13;
      medium term, but postponing necessary reforms will only exacerbate the future fiscal burden. In 1981, the Chilean&#13;
      government was confronted by a steep increase in the beneficiary-to-contributor ratio and replaced its PAYG pension&#13;
      system by a fully funded one based on individual capital accounts. However, the transition proved costly for the budget in&#13;
      the next few years, because contributions stopped flowing to the public accounts but benefits for those who had already&#13;
      retired under the old system continued to drain public finances. To make the reform feasible, the government also issued&#13;
      recognition bonds to recognize the pension claims of active contributors who were moved to the new funded system&#13;
      and provided guarantees of minimum pensions for those in the new system. Substantial fiscal resources were needed&#13;
      to finance the transition. Ruiz-Tagle and Castro (1997) estimated that in the decade after the reform the additional fiscal&#13;
      burden averaged more than 6 percent of GDP annually, but overall, these policies brought back long-term fiscal solvency.&#13;
      Over time, the pool of old beneficiaries shrank by attrition and the cost of the reform gradually faded, yet the minimum&#13;
      pension guarantees remained a source of considerable fiscal burden. However, postponing the reforms would have only&#13;
      added to this burden, because old-age dependency ratios kept increasing, and thus the pool of retirees entitled to pension&#13;
      benefits would have gone up with each year of postponement. Chile consolidated the reform process in 2006 by passing&#13;
      a Fiscal Responsibility Law that obligates the government to contribute 0.2-0.5 percent of GDP annually to the Pension&#13;
      Reserve Fund, which was created to pay the statutory minimum in social security benefits. A similar approach in Russia&#13;
      would not only facilitate its transition to a more sustainable fiscal path, but would also help shore-up living standards for&#13;
      those who may be negatively affected by the transition.&#13;
&#13;
32&#13;
     	Simulations of alternative price trajectories show that a recovery from the current slump in oil and gas prices could cause a long-term&#13;
      increase in savings accumulated in the wealth funds. Although the Reserve Fund hits its threshold value of 7 percent of GDP in 2035, the&#13;
      Welfare Fund reaches just 5 percent. However, this only occurs in the outer years of the projections, by which time the old-age dependency&#13;
      ratio will be about 50 percent higher than it is now, and as a result reforming the social security system will be more costly and more&#13;
      politically difficult.&#13;

            Russia economic report : balancing economic
            adjustment and transformation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia’s recession deepened in the first
            half of 2015 with a severe impact on households. Adverse
            external conditions pose a serious challenge to short-term
            growth prospects. Yet, high policy uncertainty prevails and
            the country’s outlook hinges not only on the evolution of
            external factors but also on its internal capacity to adapt
            to an increasingly difficult macro-fiscal context. The
            macro-fiscal adjustment heightens risks to financial
            stability and fiscal sustainability. Economic policy should
            support the economic transformation that began in 2014.
            While adapting to relative price changes and the
            reallocation of productive factors to new sectors is a
            difficult process, policies that facilitate Russia’s
            economic transformation can have lasting positive effects.
            Facilitating structural change will be especially critical
            as Russia strives to cope in the long-term with a
            simultaneous demographic and economic transformation driven
            by a rapidly aging and shrinking population and by the
            diminishing relative importance of the natural resource
            sector. Successfully addressing these challenges will
            require a combination of fiscal discipline, regulatory
            restraint, and institutional capacity building, while
            resisting pressure to adopt policies that may temporarily
            mitigate the disruptive effects of the adjustment process at
            the expense of long-term growth. In the short-term, strong
            signals indicating the government’s commitment to regulatory
            discipline and to policies that facilitate the macroeconomic
            adjustment process will speed up the recovery of
            private-sector confidence and promote investment despite
            tight financial conditions.
