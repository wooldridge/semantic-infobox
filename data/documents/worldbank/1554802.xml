ABSTRACT&#13;
The Ivory Coast experienced a series of external shocks in the&#13;
last seven years which led to a severe deterioration of its financial&#13;
position and to negative growth since 1981. This occurred at a time when&#13;
the growth potential of the country had declined and the ability of the&#13;
economy to adjust was limited by distortions in the system of macroeconomic&#13;
and sectoral incentives. To remedy this situation, the Government has&#13;
undertaken a program of stringent financial recovery and of structural&#13;
adjustment, articulated around substantial policy reforms.&#13;
This paper analyzes the short-term effects of various trade and&#13;
incentive policies that can be envisaged within this program. The analysis&#13;
is carried out through a series of comparative static experiments done in&#13;
the framework of a computable general equilibrium model. Simulations are&#13;
performed to assess the impact of exchange rate adjustments, tariff reform,&#13;
the introduction of an export subsidy and, finally, removal of quantitative&#13;
import restrictions.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
After two decades of continuous growth, the Ivory Coast economy&#13;
experienced a series of external shocks over the last six years: the coffee&#13;
and cocoa boom in 1976 and 1977; a 40 % decline in the terms of trade between&#13;
1978 and 1982; and sharp increases in real interest rates on international&#13;
,,.&#13;
markets. These shocks have led to a rapid deterioration of the country's&#13;
financial position and to two consecutive years of recession in 1981 and 1982.&#13;
These dramatic changes have affected the Ivory Coast at a critical&#13;
phase of its development. Since the mid-seventies, the growth potential of&#13;
the country had progressively declined due primarily to low returns on public&#13;
investment, inefficiencies in puJ'ic enterprises, and inadequate support for&#13;
agricultural development. At the same time, the ability of the economy to&#13;
adjust was severely hampered by rigidities and distortions in the system of&#13;
macroeconomic and sectoral incentives, particularly with respect to the&#13;
exchange rate, tariffs, quantitative restrictions, and export incentives.&#13;
In order to remedy this situation, the government has embarked on&#13;
both a stringent financial recovery program and a structural adjustment&#13;
program that calls for substantial policy reforms, in particular in the system&#13;
of incentives in industry and agriculture.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to analyze in a general equ:ilibrium&#13;
framework the short-term effects of various trade and incentive policies that&#13;
could be envisaged within the framework of these programs. This is done&#13;
through a series of comparative statics simulations carried out with a&#13;
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Ivorian economy, which has&#13;
been built along lines already followed in an increasing number of countries.&#13;
In Chapter 1, we present an overview of the Ivorian economy and&#13;
discuss the most salient economic developments over the last six years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Chapter 2 is devoted to a general discussion of CGE models, with a special&#13;
emphasis on the treatment of foreign trade, and to a detailed pre,-entation of&#13;
the Ivory Coast model. Turning to policy simulations, an analysis of&#13;
experiments on exchange rate adjustments is presented in Chapter 3. After&#13;
stressing the importance and the scope of the exchange rate issue for the&#13;
Ivory Coast today, we briefly discuss the economic mechanisms involved, and&#13;
then turn to an in-depth discussion of the base experiment and the sensitivity&#13;
analysis0  Chapter 4 contains an analysis of the experiments on tariff and&#13;
subsidy reforms, as well as a detailed presentation of the base experiments&#13;
and a series of alternative experiments. This policy issue is directly&#13;
relateu to the reforms envisioned by the government in the structural&#13;
adjustment program. In Chapter 5, we examine the impact of the removal of&#13;
quantitative import restrictions on the economy when exchange rate adjustments&#13;
are allowed.&#13;

I. BACKGROUND&#13;
CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF THE IVORIAN ECONOMY&#13;
This chapter is devoted to a broad description of the structure of&#13;
the Ivorian economy, and to a discussion of the current economic situation and&#13;
policy issues facing the country, which constitute the background and the&#13;
rationale for the present study.&#13;
1. Structure of the Economy&#13;
In the first two decades following independence, the Ivory Coast's GDP&#13;
grew 7.5% annually, a rate of growth which ranks among the highest in Africa&#13;
and among the top fifteen in the world. This performance has been based on a&#13;
rapidly growing agricultural sector (primarily coffee and cocoa), which&#13;
generated surpluses for in. stment, and on a liberal and pragmatic economic&#13;
policy that made the productive use of foreign factors possible. Out of a&#13;
total population of 8.3 million, 1.5 million are immigrants who responded to&#13;
employment opportunities in the Ivory Coast and to the growing income&#13;
differentials with its neighbors. With an annual population growth of 4.3%&#13;
per year (including 1.5% due to migration), per capita income increased 3.5%&#13;
annually until the end of the 1970s. Although a severe slowdown has since&#13;
ocCurred, the Ivory Coast had a per capita GDP of US$1,200 in 1981, ranking&#13;
first among Sub-Saharan developing countries-I/ This compares with US$870 for&#13;
Nigeria, US$880 for Cameroon and US$430 for Senegal.&#13;
The following tables provide some basic macroeconomic indicators on&#13;
the structure of the economy.&#13;

Agriculture is a major component of the Ivorian economy and the&#13;
basis of its development. It contributes one-third to GDP, provides around&#13;
50% of exports, and employs an estimated 75% of the labor force, of which 13%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are immigrants.l/ The Ivory Coast is the world's third largest exporter of&#13;
coffee, and the most important producer of Robusta. It is also the world's&#13;
largest producer and exporter of cocoa. There are two main agricultural&#13;
regions in the country. The Southern Forest and the Northern Savannah have&#13;
different climates, natural endowments, culture and income levels.&#13;
Traditional cash crops (coffee, cocoa, palm oil and, more recently, rubber)&#13;
grow in the rich Southern Forest. The more arid and much poorer North is the&#13;
area of development of cotton and sugar production. Food crops are grown&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
Table 1.3 presents details of the structure of agricultural&#13;
production in the Ivrory Coast. Food crops and cash crops contribute almost&#13;
equally to nominal output and value added, while acreage appears to be larger&#13;
for cash crops, especially coffee and cocoa. However, the acreage data should&#13;
be regarded only as indicators, because many plantations are intercropped, and&#13;
part of the area under food cultivation remains unaccounted for due to the&#13;
absence of extension services for these crops, (except rice).&#13;

Since the early 1960s, the government has emphasized the development&#13;
of cash crops, through direct intervention in production consisting of the&#13;
provision of extension services by public enterprises, or through market&#13;
regulation.1/  Cash crops under regulated prices include coffee, cocoa, cotton&#13;

presented in this chapter are taken from the joint report of the Caisse&#13;

and palm oil. For these products, official producer prices are fixed at the&#13;
beginning of each season, and a Stabilization Fund makes up the difference&#13;
between the domestic price and the price obtained in export markets. This&#13;
mechanism provides producers with more stable incomes and has also generated&#13;
substantial surpluses for the government. Most coffee and cocoa production&#13;
comes from smallholders, who typically benefit from the extension services of&#13;
SATMACI, the regional development agency for the Center Zone. Cotton is&#13;
produced almost exclusively by small farmers under the auspices of CIDT, the&#13;
regional development agency for the north, which provides extension services&#13;
and controls the marketing of the crop. Seventy percent of palm oil&#13;
originates from the industrial plantations of PALMINDUSTRIE, with village&#13;
plantations accounting for the rest. Rubber culture is also dominated by&#13;
public enterprises, and smallholders represent less than 8% of total&#13;
production. Finally, the production of sugar is entirely controlled by&#13;
SODESUCRE, which runs six sugar complexes in the north and the center of the&#13;
country.&#13;
In the mid-seventies, the government started to give more priority&#13;
to the development of food crops. However food crops have not been subject to&#13;
direct intervention by the public sector, in sharp contrast with the situation&#13;
prevailing for most cash crops. The only exceptions is rice. Producer and&#13;
consumer prices for rice are regulated through the Caisse de Perequation, and&#13;
assistance is provided by extension services of regional development agencies.&#13;
Public enterprises are not limited to the agricultural sector, but&#13;
play a role in other key parts of the economy as well, with the important&#13;
exception of industry. Although it favors a liberal type of economy, the&#13;
Ivorian Government has always relied partly on public enterprises to implement&#13;
its development policies, particularly in areas where private initiative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

remained inadequate. Public enterprises are important because of their&#13;
contribution to national production and investment.   It has been estimated&#13;
that one-third of agricultural production is directly dependent on public&#13;
enterprises. They are also involved in land transportation, shipping,&#13;
services, construction and electricity. Overall, 15-20% of GDP can be&#13;
attributed to parastatal enterprises in the Ivory Coast.1/&#13;
The contribution of public enterprises to investment is even more&#13;
important. According to the Budgets Economiques [1982], their share of total&#13;
investment was 29% in 1980, 26% in 1981 and 22% in 1982, after having reached&#13;

A large part of these investments have been financed by foreign&#13;
capital, which has been attracted by publicly guaranteed investment&#13;
opportunities. As a result, public enterprises have been instrumental in the&#13;
opening of the economy to foreign investors. Accordingly, they account today&#13;
for 35-40% of the external public debt. Finally, since public enterprises&#13;
investments are ultimately controlled at the government level, they represent&#13;
an important policy variable for the government. With both public enterprise&#13;
and central government investment, the government controlled as much as 70% GZ&#13;
total investment in 1980.&#13;
Industry has been one of the most dynamic sectors in the Ivorian&#13;
economy.l/  Since independence, manufazturing activity has grown at the rate&#13;
of 13% per year, and its share in GDP rose from 4% in 1960 to 13.8% in 1980.&#13;
This rapid expansion has been primarily based on import substitution and on&#13;
the processing of local agricultural raw materials for exports. Until the&#13;
early 1970s, industrial development took place in the framework of a simple&#13;
system of incentives, which were essentially based on a moderate tariff&#13;
schedule that applied equal protection among industrial activities, and&#13;
without quantitative import restrictions. The 1973 tariff reform and, more&#13;
recently, the proliferation of quantitative import restrictions, have&#13;
introduced increasing distortions in the industrial incentives structure. As a&#13;
result, inefficient import substituting enterprises have been established and&#13;
a strong bias against exporting activities has appeared.2/&#13;

This sector developed without the direct involvement of public&#13;
enterprises. Instead, it relied exclusively on private initiative, which was&#13;
mainly foreign, especially in the first stages of industrialization. Foreign&#13;
firms were attracted by the stable and liberal framework provided by the&#13;
government as well as by the incentives provided under the Investment Code.&#13;

Table 1.5 summarizes some key indicators for the structure of the&#13;
manufacturing sector. The sector consists of two distinct types of&#13;
activities: those which are based on the processing of local agricultural or&#13;
forestry raw materials (food processing, textiles, and construction&#13;
materials); and those which import raw materials intensively (chemicals and&#13;
plastics and engineering industries). The former were the leaders in the&#13;
early industrialization process of the Ivory Coast and are relatively export-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
oriented. The second type of industry is much less export-oriented, and&#13;
relies heavily on imports for its operations (50% of intermediate inputs are&#13;
imported). With the exception of fertilizers, these industries fall far short&#13;
of satisfying domestic demand, as is shown by the ratio of imports over&#13;
domestic supply. This is because local production is concentrated on specific&#13;
product lines and imports in these areas are essentially complementary to&#13;
domestic production. Moreover, engineering industries alone represent more&#13;
than a third of the imports of the country, and 60% of its total imports are&#13;
manufactured goods.&#13;
Energy dependence is rapidly decreasing due to the development of&#13;
hydroelectric production in the 1960s and 1970s and to the current expansion&#13;
of the oil sector. Although the start of power production by several new dams&#13;
in the late 1970s has not made the Ivory Coast energy self-sufficient, the&#13;
consumption of fuel oil needed to generate electricity has declined by 57.7%&#13;
since 1979 as a result. The prospect of the huge Soubre dam, expected to&#13;
become operational in the late 1980s, makes self-sufficiency a reasonable&#13;
prospect. Moreovpr, petroleum production is increasing, and one-third of&#13;
Ivorian consumption of crude oil was produced domestically in 1981. Although&#13;
the projections were to be lowered recently, the outlook is still for the&#13;
Ivory Coast to become a net oil exporter by 1986. Finally, an oil refinery&#13;
with a 4 million ton capacity already meets domestic requirements as well as&#13;
exports to neighboring Upper Volta and Mali.&#13;
The Monetary arrangements for the Ivory Coast play an important role&#13;
in development. The country is a member of the West Africa Monetary Union&#13;
(UMOA)1/ (with Benin, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Upper Volta), which centralizes&#13;
foreign currency reserves, issues a single currency (the CFA Franc) through a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
common Central Bank, has a common interest rate structure and allows free&#13;
transfers of funds within the Union. The CFAF is linked to the French Franc&#13;
at a parity which has never changed since independence.   It is fully&#13;
convertible with the French Franc, and the French. Treasury is responsible for&#13;
the necessary operations to maintain parity. Although this limits the member&#13;
countries' autonomous monetary policy and prevents the adoption of exchange&#13;
rate policy, convertibility with the FF and the backing of the French Treasury&#13;
provide advantages that appear to have been beneficial for their development.&#13;
The Ivory Coast is also a member of the West Africa Economic&#13;
Community (CEAO), a customs union with Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and&#13;
Upper Volta. As a partner in the Lome agreements, the Ivory Coast receives&#13;
duty-free treatment for its exports to the EEC. These external ties are&#13;
reflected in the trade structure of the Ivory Coast. Approximately half of&#13;
the country's trade is with the EEC, while about 10% of exports are to CEAO&#13;
countries. Thus almost two-thirds of exports are to countries with which the&#13;
Ivory Coast has special relationships and arrangements.&#13;

2. Recent Economic Developments and Policy Issues: 1976-1982&#13;
Over the past five years, the Ivory Coast economy has been subject&#13;
to a series of external shocks: the coffee and cocoa boom in 1976 and 1977, a&#13;
40% decline in the terms of trade following the sharp drop in coffee and cocoa&#13;
prices in 1978, the increase in the price of imported oil, and, more recently,&#13;
sharp increases in real interest rates on international financial markets.&#13;
These shocks have led to rapid financial deterioration and to a severe&#13;
slowdown in economic activity. The Ivory coast experienced two consecutive&#13;
years of recession in 1981 and 1982, in sharp contrast to the continuous&#13;
record of economic growth since the early sixties.&#13;
During the coffee and cocoa boom, when prices for these two crops&#13;
were multiplied by 3.6 and 2.2 respectively between 1975 and 1977, large&#13;
surpluses for the Stabilization Fund were generated and the balance of&#13;
payments situation substantially improved. Under these favorable&#13;
circumstances, the Government embarked on an ambitious investment program.&#13;
The share of public investment in GDP increased from 15 to over 25% between&#13;
1976 and 1978. This program was also financed through external borrowing,&#13;
which was possible because balance of payments pressures had declined. The&#13;
share of investment financed by national savings thus fell from 50% to less&#13;
than 20% between 1976 and 1978, while the gross inflow of public capital&#13;
increased from CFAF 56 billion to about CFAF 200 billion between 1975 and&#13;
1977. GDP grew by almost 10% in real terms in 1978.&#13;
However, between 1977 and 1978 coffee and cocoa prices declined by&#13;
31% and 10%, respectively, and remained constant at these low levels until the&#13;
first half of 1980, while the public investment program was maintained at a&#13;
level corresponding to 20% of GDP. This created several concerns.     On the one&#13;
hand, the Ivory Coast's terms of trade declined by 15% between 1977 and 1978,&#13;
mainly due to the decline of export prices and by an additional 17% between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
1978 and 1980, due to sharp increases in import prices. On the other hand,&#13;
the goverment increasingly relied on foreign borrowing to finance its&#13;
investment program. As a result, a public sector deficit of around 10% of GDP&#13;
appeared in 1979, rising to 12.7% in 1980, and the balance of payments turned&#13;
negative in 1979. The abrupt decline in coffee and cocoa prices that started&#13;
in the second half of 1980 further aggravated the situation. In 1980, the&#13;
current account deficit represented 16% of GDP, and the net foreign assets of&#13;
the Central Bank were exhausted despite continued heavy borrowing abroad,&#13;
while correspondingly, a CFAF 118 billion overdraft was registered in UMOA's&#13;
operations account with the French Treasury.&#13;
In 1981, the government initiated a drastic financial stabilization&#13;
program within the framework of an Extended Facility agreement with the IMF.&#13;
The program called for a reduction in the public sector deficit to 8.6% of GDP&#13;
in 1982 and 6.3% in 1983; a decline in the current account deficit to 11.8% of&#13;
GDP in 1982 and 8.3% in 1983; and the restoration of overall balance of&#13;
payments equilibrium by 1983.&#13;
Although the fiscal targets of the stabilization program were met by&#13;
the end of 1982, a series of unfavorable international economic developments&#13;
resulted in a significantly larger current account deficit than was originally&#13;
targeted. Indeed, the Ivory Coast's terms of trade declined again by 16%&#13;
between 1981 and 1982.   Simultaneouisly, the country became increasingly&#13;
dependent on nonconcessional loans to finance the public investment program&#13;
and the public sector deficit, at rapidly increasing interest rates. Finally,&#13;
oil production did not expand as expected, reaching a level of 1.3 million&#13;
tons in 1982 against the expected 3.5 million tons. At the same time, a surge&#13;
in gross foreign borrowings by the public sector from CFAF 277 billion to CFAF&#13;
407 billion between 1981 and 1982 contributed to a reduction in the overall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
balance of payments deficit within the program target. However, it presaged&#13;
rising debt service ratios in future years, and more deficits of the overall&#13;
balance are projected at least until 1987. The following table summarizes the&#13;
main macroeconomic indicators for the period 1978-1982.&#13;

1/ Preliminary figure.&#13;
This sharp deterioration in the internal and external financial&#13;
situation has affected the Ivory Coast at a critical phase in its&#13;
development. Two decades of growth were essentially based on the exploitation&#13;
of the most obvious areas of comparative advantage, particularly in&#13;
agriculture, and on the development of a dynamic, although still limited,&#13;
industrial base. The growth potential of the country progressively&#13;
deteriorated during the later part of the seventies primarily because of the&#13;
low economic returns on the expanded public investment program launched in&#13;
1977; the rigidity of the system of macroeconomic and sectoral incentives in&#13;
the face of rapid changes in the country's external environment and inadequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
support for agricultural development.&#13;
The rapid expansion of public investment toward the end of the&#13;
seventies was accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the quality of&#13;
investment projects. Unlike the 1971-75 plan, the increase in public&#13;
investment for the 1976-80 program was mainly allocated to large projects with&#13;
high unit costs. In agriculture, for example, most of the increased&#13;
allocation was for six sugar complexes which had unit operating costs two to&#13;
three times above world market prices. Overall, it has been estimated that&#13;
the incremental national income from the US $8 billion spent on public&#13;
investme-nt from 1976-80 was approximately 40% less than it would have been if&#13;
earlier criteria had been maintained. This figure translates into an annual&#13;
cost to the economy in terms of foregone earnings of around 5% of GDP in the&#13;
early 1980se./&#13;
The rigidity of the system of macroeconomic and sectoral incentives&#13;
has imposed more constraints on growth and on the country's capacity to&#13;
respond flexibly to rapidly changing external conditions.   The sharp&#13;
acceleration of domestic inflation after 1975 and the sharp deterioration in&#13;
the terms of trade between 1978 and 1982 led to a large overvaluation of the&#13;
CFA Franc vis-a-vis the currencies of the Ivory Coast's main trading&#13;
partners. This situation revealed fundamental deficiencies in the incentive&#13;
system. Although major agricultural exports were not immediately hurt by the&#13;
overvaluation because of their considerable comparative advantage, this was&#13;
not the case in the industrial sector, where comparative advantage was not as&#13;
strong. Expansion of the industrial sector has been directly affected by the&#13;
strong bias against exports in the system of industrial incentives. At the&#13;
1/  See World Bank [1979 .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
same time, the most obvious opportunities for exports within the protected&#13;
CEAO markets have been exploited. As a result, the Ivory Coast will have to&#13;
turn to non-regional markets to sustain the growth of its industrial base and"&#13;
to generate the foreign exchange earnings required to balance its external&#13;
accounts.&#13;
Finally, the growth potential of the country has suffered from&#13;
inadequate support of agricultural development. Although agriculture has been&#13;
a key to the country's successful economic performance, agricultural&#13;
development projects have remained a relatively sriall part of the public&#13;
investment program, apart from the large expenditures for the six sugar&#13;
complexes. More recently, however, the Government has reinforced planning&#13;
capabilities in the agricultural sector, with the objective of designing a&#13;
coherent development strategy based on an adequate system of incentives&#13;
reflecting the medium to long-term comparative advantage of the country in&#13;
particular crops.&#13;

CHAPTER 2: THE MODEL&#13;
Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have generated a large&#13;
literature since the pioneering works of Johansen [1960] and, more recently,&#13;
of Adeilnan and Robinson [1978]. The objective of this chapter is to provide&#13;
an overview of this class of models and to focus subsequently on the&#13;
characteristics of the Ivorian model.1&#13;
1. General Structure of CGE Models&#13;
Computable general equilibrium models simulate the functioning of an&#13;
economy by explicitly capturing the behavior of the various agents&#13;
(households, firms, government, rest of the world), the institutional&#13;
framework (fiscal system and transfer mechanisms), and the market clearing&#13;
processes (price and quantity). As a result, they can be considered&#13;
"structural" as opposed to "reduced form" models.,&#13;
CGE models are in the tradition of economy-wide multisector models&#13;
that have been used for development planning over the last two decades. In&#13;
contrast with traditional input-output and programming models that are best-&#13;
suited for planning in centralized economies, CGE models have been developed&#13;
for policy simulation in mixed economies, in which relative prices vary in&#13;
response to supply and demand decisions by individual agents, and where the&#13;
government can affect the outcome of these decisions, either indirectly&#13;
through fiscal and incentive policies, or directly through intervention in&#13;
some sectors of the economy. This class of models has recently been used for&#13;
planning and policy analysis as well as for the evaluation of the performance&#13;
1/ For a comprehensive analysis of CGEs, see Dervis, de Melo and Robinson&#13;
[1982], hereinafter referred to as DMR.   Since this textbook pro-vides the&#13;
description of a general type of CGE on which the model presented in the&#13;
paper is based, it should also be considered general background for this&#13;
study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
and prospects of an increasing number of developing countries. -&#13;
The structure of CGE models is Walrasian in spirit, stressing&#13;
interaction among economic agents and the workings of market clearing&#13;
processes. At the same time, these models can formally incorporate rigidities&#13;
and distortions that are particularly strong in developing economies. The&#13;
treatment of foreign trade, for example, can substantially differ from a&#13;
standard neoclassical story through the introduction of various foreign&#13;
exchange rationing schemes (see Lewis and Urata [1983] or Bhattachyara, Grais&#13;
and Pleskovik [1983]) or through quantitative import restrictions (see below).&#13;
A CGE model is designed to provide a description of the evolution of&#13;
an economy over a number of periods, given the value of exogenous parameters&#13;
and policy instruments. Its structure can be separated into a static general&#13;
equilibrium model, which solves within each period, and a dynamic between&#13;
periods model, which links two successive periods.&#13;
Within each period, the model provides a set of equilibrium prices&#13;
which leads to a balance of supply and demand on each market, given the&#13;
behavioral rules of the agents, exogenous parameters and the way marks s&#13;
operate.  Supply and demand for factors, commodities and foreign exchange are&#13;
derived from each agent's optimal choice and from government decisions.&#13;
Basically, it is assumed that households maximize their utility, given their&#13;
budget constraint, while firms maximize their profits, given their technical&#13;
constraints. Once supply and demand on each market have been determined, a&#13;
price system has to be found to clear those markets. At this stage, the&#13;
definition of the way each market operates is crucial, as it is often&#13;
necessary to impose particular restrictions on markets that represent strong&#13;

Armarand and Grais [1983], or Taylor et al. [1980].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
departures from the pure neoclassical paradigm (such as fixed nominal prices&#13;
or fixed supplies).&#13;
After the equilibrium solution is found for a given period, the&#13;
between-period part of the model updates all the exogenous variables entering&#13;
thie static part of the model. This operation is done using: (1) the&#13;
equilibrium values of the foregone period, such as the amount of investment by&#13;
sector that is added to existing capital to yield new capital stocks; (2)&#13;
government policy decisions, such as a new level of tariffs or public&#13;
investment; (3) simple exogenously specified trends, such as the growth of the&#13;
population; and (4) pure exogenous variables, such as world prices. The model&#13;
can then find a solution for a new period on the basis on the new set of&#13;
exogenous data.&#13;
CGE models are therefore basically simulation models, designed to&#13;
investigate the impact of policies that work through the market system, such&#13;
as taxes, tariffs or subsidy changes, or to analyze the impact of direct&#13;
government intervention in the economy, such as the profile and composition of&#13;
the public investment program, pricing policies or import restrictions.l/&#13;
2. The Treatment of Foreign Trade in CGE Models&#13;
The treatment of foreign trade has been given particular attention&#13;
in CGE models.&#13;
Two different approaches have been proposed in the literature for&#13;
the treatment of foreign trade. On one hand, classical trade theory is built&#13;
on the small country assumption, so that each country is a price taker on&#13;
international markets. This assumption makes a strong distinction between&#13;
traded goods, which are considered perfectly substitutable for imports and&#13;

- 21 -&#13;
whose prices are fixed on the international market, and non-traded goods,&#13;
whose prices are entirely determined on the domestic market. Along with&#13;
constant returns to scale in production, this theory leads to extreme&#13;
specialization among countries, and it rules out two-way trade.&#13;
On the other hand, the structuralist school assumes that imports are&#13;
non-competitive, so that the degree of substitutability between domestic goods&#13;
and imports is zero (this is, for instance, the assumption in the two-gap&#13;
models). Imports are treated as perfect complements for domestic goods. This&#13;
approach results in a rigid framework in which trade policy has no role to&#13;
play in closing the foreign exchange gap.&#13;
The assumption made in this class of CGE models is that sectoral&#13;
imports are neither complete substitutes nor full complements of domestic&#13;
production. In other words, two-way trade at a sectoral level as well as&#13;
price differentiation between domestic and import prices is allowed. Both&#13;
features are ruled out by traditional models. The original formalization of&#13;
these ideas was made by Armington [1969], who introduced the notion of a&#13;
composite good, that is, an aggregate of imported and domestic goods. In this&#13;
approach, agents do not demand either domestic or imported goods, but an&#13;
aggregate of the two. The composition of the aggregate good depends on the&#13;
relative price of domestic and imported goods, which may differ.&#13;
This specification could hardly be sustained at the ideal most&#13;
disaggregated level where all goods would truly be perfect substitutes with&#13;
imports, but is is of considerable relevance at the high degree of aggregation&#13;
usually taken in CGE models, and supported by many empirical evidence (see&#13;
Armington [1969]). Instead of the strong distinction between traded and non-&#13;
traded goods this approach implies that sectors are characterized by different&#13;
degrees of tradability depending on their trade substitution elasticities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Similarly, the extent to which a particular good is complement or a substitute&#13;
to its import equivalent varies according to the relative size of trade&#13;
substitution and own-price elasticities. 1/&#13;
Exports can be treated in various ways in CGE models, following the&#13;
type of country under study. The modelling of exports can be based on&#13;
assumptions ranging from the small country assumption with fixed export output&#13;
ratios to product differentiation with downward sloping demand on the export&#13;
market. In the Ivory Coast model, we used a third option in which the ratio&#13;
of exports to output in a particular sector is assumed to be an increasing&#13;
function of the ratio of export to domestic prices. This specification, which&#13;
is retained for the modelling of manufacturing sectors, can be thought of as a&#13;
formalization of the arbitrage open to the domestic producers, who would&#13;
choose between offering their output on the domestic market or on the export&#13;
market depending on the relative incentives perceived in both markets. This&#13;
approach allows to model phenomena which cannot otherwise be properly handled&#13;
at the level of aggregation used in this type of model.&#13;
Finally, it is possible to consider various import rationing&#13;
situations in the framework of CGE models. A quantitative import quota&#13;
mechanism, which is used in the Ivory Coast model, is described in Section 3&#13;
below. Premia rationing, corresponding to the case in which a parallel market&#13;
for import licenses exist in a country, or simple quantitative rationing by&#13;
direct allocation can also be analyzed, but were not used in our model. 2/&#13;
1/ Goods whose trade substitution elasticity exceeds (is smaller than) their&#13;
own-price will be regarded as import substitutes (complements).&#13;

taken into account.&#13;

3. The Ivory Coast Model&#13;
This section first presents the data sources and the principal&#13;
characteristics of the model in terms of aggregation level, behaviour,&#13;
important assumptions and market clearing mechanisms. It then turns to a more&#13;
detailed discussion of some particular specifications, which have been&#13;
designed to reflect some important features of the Ivorian economy. A&#13;
presentation of the way effective protection can be defined and measured in&#13;
these models follows. This is a key discussion in this study as it deals with&#13;
concepts which are at the center of the ongoing reforms in the country as well&#13;
as of the experiments presented in the paper. Finally, we discuss the choice&#13;
of trade substitution and export supply elasticities.&#13;
(i) Data Base&#13;
The data sources used for the model come from Budgets Econaniques&#13;
(Economic Budgets), Comptabilite Nationale (National Accounts), Centrale des&#13;
Bilans (Census bureau for corporate societies) as well as from a 1979&#13;
Consumption Budget Survey and Ministry of Agriculture data. Data from these&#13;
various sources have been made consistent in the frameTork of a Social&#13;
Accounting Matrix (SAM), presented in Annex 2. A detailed description of its&#13;
construction is given in Michel and Noel [1983].&#13;
(ii) Principal Characteristics&#13;
The main features of the model, i.e. the behavior of the various&#13;
agents, the principal assumptions, and the market clearing mechanisms, are&#13;
described in this section. The mathematical formulation of the model is given&#13;
in Annex 1. Annex 2 provides, together with the SAM, other statistical&#13;
information such as production structure, input-output matrix, and consumption&#13;
shares.&#13;
The production side of the economy is disaggregated into fifteen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
sectors.  Of these, six are agricultural sectors, six industrial, two non-&#13;
traded, and one services sector. Firms are assumed to be price-taking agents&#13;
who maximize their short-run profit to determine their labor demand and output&#13;
supply. Capital stocks are fixed for a given period. Intermediate&#13;
consumption is required in proportion to output according to a fixed structure&#13;
by product. Some sectors have a fixed output in the short run and,&#13;
accordingly, fixed labor demand and intermediate consumption. This is the&#13;
case of "forestry" and "mining and petrl'eum" sectors, both of which have been&#13;
assumed not to be price-responsive in the short-run. This latter situation&#13;
must not be confused with that of sectors whose prices are set by the&#13;
government and which therefore also appear as having an essentially fixed&#13;
output in the short run (see iii-(a) below).&#13;
Public and private investment levels result from the choice of the&#13;
"closure" rule (see (iii) below).   They are broken down according to two&#13;
different structures in order to determine investment by sector of&#13;
destination. Investment by sector of destination is in turn converted into&#13;
investment by sector of origin, which forms part of the final demand.&#13;
The model distinguishes five household categories (two rural and&#13;
three urban) corresponding to five labor categories. Each household&#13;
category's income is the sum of its labor renumeration, its profit share, its&#13;
transfers and share of remittances from abroad. The allocation of profits,&#13;
transfers and remittances between labor categories is exogenous (see Michel&#13;
and Noel [1983]).  Labor remumeration is the outcome of the labor market&#13;
mechanism (see below). The share of consumption and savi-ngs into post-tax&#13;
income is constant and real consumption is broken down into consumption&#13;
demands by product through a Cobb-Douglas consumption function. All savings&#13;
are collected into a "savings pool" (see (iii)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Labor markets are, at this stage, modeled in a very simple way.&#13;
Labor demand for each labor category is the result of firms optimizing&#13;
behavior. Nominal wages are assumed to be fixed in the short run, reflecting&#13;
minimum wage policies in effect in the country. Labor supply is always in&#13;
excess of labor demand at the prevailing wage rate in the short run, and&#13;
unemployment is therefore endogenous.&#13;
The government collects income taxes, tariffs, indirect taxes, and&#13;
the Stabilization Fund surplus (or deficit), as well as a fixed share of the&#13;
exogenous capital inflows. Part of this revenue is saved and the rest is&#13;
spent in transfers, subsidies, wage remumeration, and public consumption. The&#13;
balance of the government budget is done either on public consumption or on&#13;
public savings, according to the closure rule (see (iii) below).&#13;
All goods are composites of domestic and imported goods, aggregated&#13;
through a constant returns to scale GES function, following the Armington&#13;
assumption of imperfect substituability (see section 2 above). The relative&#13;
share of imports and domestic production of any particular good is thus a&#13;
fumction of their relative prices. The allocation of domestic production&#13;
between export and domestic market is a function of the relative prices on&#13;
these markets, derived through a logistic function (see also section 2 above).&#13;
In general, product markets are price clearing, although some&#13;
domestic prices may be set by the government. In such cases the markets are&#13;
cleared by quantity adjustment, with the volume of exports as the endogenous&#13;
variable (see iii (a) below). Factor markets are solved for unemployment&#13;
since nominal wages are fixed and do not adjust to match demand and supply.&#13;
When a flexible exchange rate regime is chosen, the exchange rate then adjusts&#13;
to generate a given level of deficit or surplus of the balance of trade (or,&#13;
equivalentely, of the balance of payment since transfers with the rest of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
world and capital rmovements are exogenous) . The model is solved following the&#13;
"product market strategy" described in Annex B of DMR. In this method, factor&#13;
marlcets are solved Eirst and products markets are then solved based on the&#13;
solution for factor markets, after having been ordered in a particular and&#13;
convenient way.&#13;
(iii) Particular Specifications&#13;
The Ivory Coast model contains three particular specifications which&#13;
have been designed to take into account important aspects of the Ivorian&#13;
economy. These are: the existence of fixed prices in the agricultural sector&#13;
and the Stabilization Fund mechanism; the presence of quantitative&#13;
restrictions on the imports of some goods; the large share of public&#13;
investment in total investment. We describe in this subsection how these&#13;
characteristics have been taken into account in the model.&#13;
(a) Fixed Prices in the Agricultural Sector and the Stabilization Fund&#13;
The Stabilization Fund is essentially an institution designed to&#13;
shield domestic producers of certain agricultural products from the world&#13;
market fluctuations. It is taken into account in the model by allowing for&#13;
the possibility of exogenously setting the nominal price received by&#13;
producers. The positive (or negative) difference is then received (or paid)&#13;
by the Stabilization Fund account which, in turn, transfers its surplulses to&#13;
(or has its deficit financed by) the government.   This captures the essence of&#13;
the stabilization mechanisms of the country. It should be noted that the&#13;
implementation of such a mechanism has no consequence on the specification of&#13;
exDort behavior (such as arbitrage between the two markets) and is compatible&#13;
with any price determination mode on the world market of exports (such as a&#13;
downward sloping curve for exports).&#13;
It is also possible to set certain domestic prices in the model, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
is the case in the Ivory Coast for several agricultural products. However, it&#13;
is then also necessary to specify how the market clears for excess supply or&#13;
demand since price clearing is by definition excluded. The possible solutions&#13;
range from adjustment of capacity utilization to adjustment through&#13;
competitive imports or changes in exports. Since exports crops are the goods&#13;
whose domestic prices are fixed in this model, we have assumed that excess&#13;
supply (demand) in the domestic marke.t of these goods was just balanced by an&#13;
additional (smaller) volume of exports. In such a case, the ex-ante arbitrage&#13;
decision which may have been made (see Section 2 above) will be superseded.&#13;
Export as well as domestic prices have been assumed constant for&#13;
coffee, cocoa and "other agricultural products," which account for products&#13;
mainly with fixed prices (palm oil, rubber),&#13;
(b) Import Quotas&#13;
The limitation in the number of import licenses became a common&#13;
practice for a growing number of imported goods in the Ivory Coast as a way of&#13;
protecting the domestic industry (see Chapter 5 below). Although this has not&#13;
necessarily led to binding quotas because the license ceiling has sometimes&#13;
been larger than requested, the volume of imports is effectively limited in&#13;
some key sectors, such as textiles.&#13;
Quantitative import restrictions amount to a fixed supply of imports&#13;
in the economy and reverse the logic of the treatment of imports in the&#13;
model. Indeed, if the availability of imported goods is limited and binding&#13;
and if there is no mechanism of direct allocation of imports (i.e., quantity&#13;
rationing with a rationing scheme), thi. only possibility of clearing the&#13;
demand for imports is to increase their domestic price. Since world prices&#13;
and tariffs are supposed to be fixed and exogenous, this results in a pure&#13;
rent for the importers, at a given exchange rate. Therefore, whereas in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
usual case (small country assumption), the domestic price of imports is&#13;
exogenous and its volume is endogenous, world supply being infinite, the&#13;
volume of imports is exogenous when quotas are binding and their domestic&#13;
price is endogenous. The resulting rents are separately accounted for in the&#13;
model and distributed to "urban high incorAe" households, which are assumed to&#13;
include all license holders.&#13;
(c) Treatment of the Investment-Savings Problem&#13;
The balance between investments and savings, which is an ex-post&#13;
necessary condition for equilibrium, is not ex-ante warranted given the&#13;
specifications usually retained in CGE models. This is the so-called&#13;
"closure" problem, which requires an ad hoc choice based on the way the&#13;
modeler thinks the economy works to eliminate this dilemma ("closure rule").1/&#13;
In the particular case of the Ivory Coast, public investment as a&#13;
whole (i.e. central government plus public enterprises) represented more than&#13;
three-quarters of total investment in 1980 (see Chapter 1). This suggests a&#13;
specific treatment for the investment savings problem. The government savings&#13;
rate and overall public investment can be realistically regarded as policy&#13;
variables, whereas private investment and private savings rates can be safely&#13;
considered fixed and exogenous in the short run. This means that the problem&#13;
of matching savings to investment is in fact an implicit policy choice in the&#13;
Ivory Coast. This choice is integrated explicitly in the model. In this&#13;
context, an investment-driven model should be interpreted as accounting for a&#13;
policy whereby the government decides to implement a given public investment&#13;
program 2/ and accepts the consequent adjustment of its savings rate.&#13;
1/  See Lysy [1982], Dewatripont and Michel [1983].&#13;
2/ Investment levels can be set either in nominal or real terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Conversely, a savings-driven model must be regarded as a model in which the&#13;
government decides to adapt the level of public investment to the available&#13;
savings of the economy.&#13;
Accordingly, we distinguish in the model between public and private&#13;
investment. Public investment is split into central government and public&#13;
enterprises, with different structures for origin and destination, 1/ and is&#13;
scaled in order to make overall investment match available savings in a&#13;
savings-driven model (with proportional adjustment on the two components).&#13;
Private investment has another structure of origin and destination and a.s&#13;
broken down for accounting purposes into households, oil and non-oil&#13;
investment.&#13;
(iv) Effective Tariff Protection and Nominal Tariff Structure&#13;
In the framework of its program of incentive reforms in the&#13;
industrial sector, the Government is preparing a comprehensive revision of the&#13;
Customs Code, with the objective of equalizing effective tariff protection&#13;
rates across subsectors and, within each subsector, between the various&#13;
degrees of processing. Given the importance of such a reform for the economy,&#13;
it is fundamental to concentrate on the treatment of the concept of effective&#13;
protection in the context of the CGE model before turning to a discussion of&#13;
the corresponding policy simulations. In this section, we first recall the&#13;
definition of the effective rate of protection in a partial equilibrium&#13;
framework, and briefly discuss the problems associated with the treatment of&#13;
non-tradeables in that context. We then turn to the definition of the&#13;
effective rate of protection in the framework of the CGE model, and discuss&#13;
I/ The structure of origin of investment concerns its capital goods&#13;
composition. Its structure of destination indicates the allocation of&#13;
these goods to sectoral capital stocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
the relationships between the partial and general equilibrium approaches to&#13;
the estimation of effective protection. Finally, we discuss the treatment of&#13;
the equalization of effective tariff protection rates across subsectors in the&#13;
context of the CGE model. In particular, we emphasize the impact of the&#13;
aggregation problem arising from the estimation of ERPs in the framework of&#13;
the CGE model, and we present the approach retained in the Ivory Coast model.&#13;
By definition, the effective rate of protection (ERP) for a given&#13;
sector or product measures the excess of value added per unit of output for&#13;
that sector or product over its reference value added per unit of output under&#13;
free trade, expressed as a percentage of the latter value. The main&#13;
difficulty in estimating this indicator arises from the need to estimate of&#13;
value added tnder free trade, short of a full general equilibrium model which&#13;
seldom exists at the desired level of disaggregation.&#13;
In a partial equilibrium context, it is possible to obtain a simple&#13;
expression of ERPs under the following restrictive conditions: (i) all goods&#13;
are tradeables and are perfect substitutes for imports; (ii) no substitution&#13;
is allowed between primary factors and intermediate inputs, nor among the&#13;
latter; (iii) there are constant returns to scale in production; and (iv) the&#13;
elasticity of supply of imports is infinite.-1/ The existence of non-&#13;
tradeables in the economy complicates the matter since, as long as their&#13;
elasticity of supply is non-zero, the imposition of nominal protection on a&#13;
traded good will yield an indirect protection on some non-traded goods&#13;
1/ The ERP for a given sector or product i then writes&#13;
p. - Ea,. p.&#13;
ERP  =          J&#13;
1+t. -    ji 1+t&#13;
where a. are the domestic input-output coefficients; p the lomestic prices and t&#13;
the tar ffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
through the set of input-output relationships. It then becomes difficult, in&#13;
this partial equilibrium setting, to separate the direct from the indirect&#13;
effects of protection. Three methods have been proposed to deal with this&#13;
problem.  The first method is due to Corden [1971], who proposes to measure&#13;
jointly the direct and indirect effects of protection. This is done by&#13;
applying a decomposition procedure, in which non-traded intermediate inputs&#13;
are decomposed into their traded intermediate inputs and value added&#13;
components through the input-output chain. The traded intermediate inputs&#13;
used in the production of non-traded inputs are then combined with&#13;
intermediate traded inputs used directly in the activity under study. Value&#13;
added generated in the production of non-traded inputs is combined with direct&#13;
value added in the same activity.!' Conversely, Balassa [19711 assumes that&#13;
the elasticity of supply of non-traded goods is zero, and therefore that they&#13;
do not benefit from any indirect protection. The Balassa ERP measure&#13;
therefore takes into account only the direct effect of protection on traded&#13;
goods. The third method is that of Little, Scitovsky and Scott [1970].&#13;
Assuming a single non-traded good in the economy, these authors propose to&#13;
assign to this good a fictive tariff equal to the degree of overvaluation&#13;
introduced by the structure of protection, and to treat the non-traded good as&#13;
traded in subsequent calculations.&#13;
As shown by Ray [1973], however, these three methods are limited&#13;
because they assume that non-traded goods are "pure" intermediates, i.e. that&#13;
they are not directly consumed. Once this restriction is removed, none of the&#13;
three methods holds in a general equilibrium sense and the only solution left&#13;
is to solve a general equilibrium model to obtain the reference free trade&#13;
value-added prices of non-traded goods.&#13;
1/ The ERP for a given sector i then writes exactly the same way as before&#13;
with, however different input-output coefficients (aji), reflecting the&#13;
effects of the decomposition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The problem is still more complex in the CGE framework since we&#13;
assume imperfect substitutability between domestic and imported goods. In&#13;
this context, the assumption that the domestic price of tradeables is entirely&#13;
determined by their world prices plus the impact of tariffs and other&#13;
protective measures no longer holds. Therefore, the estimation of the&#13;
effective rate of protection must be carried out in two steps. First, the&#13;
model is run with all tariff or non-tariff barriers removed to yield the&#13;
reference value-added prices. Second, the model is solved with the existing&#13;
tariff and non-tariff barriers in order to yield value-added prices under&#13;
protection. The general equilibrium ERP (ERPG) is then deduced by comparing&#13;
these two sets of prices.&#13;
The ERPG indicator is not equivalent to the rate of net effective&#13;
protection derived under the partial equilibrium methodology. This is&#13;
because, following the imperfect substitutability hypothesis, ERPG is no&#13;
longer computed with respect to the import price of the perfect import&#13;
substitute, but with respect to the reference price of the composite good&#13;
actually consumed, which is a bundle of domestic goods and actual imports.&#13;
The imperfect substitutability hypothesis has therefore a strong&#13;
implication for the link between effective protection and nominal tariff&#13;
structure at the sectoral level. In sectors where the composition of imports&#13;
and domestic goods differ substantially and where substitution elasticities&#13;
between the two types of goods are very low, a given tariff on actual imports&#13;
will have relatively less impact on the net price of the domestic good and&#13;
therefore less protective effect on domestic production, by contrast with the&#13;
protective effect obtained in a sector where the composition of imports and&#13;
domestic goods is similar and where substitution elasticities between the two&#13;
types of goods are high. For example, imagine an automotive sector where&#13;
imports are dominated by luxury cars and domestic production consists of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
assembly of low-price cars. In such a situation, the Armington specification&#13;
will entail a very high tariff on imports of luxury cars to attain a given&#13;
level of protection for the local production of low-price cars. By contrast,&#13;
the partial equilibrium methodology computes the level of protection by&#13;
estimating the impact of tariffs and other protective measures on the price of&#13;
the local product, taking the border price of the perfect substitute as a&#13;
reference. At the level of aggregation usually retained in CGE models, the&#13;
level of effective protection resulting from the Armington specification will&#13;
therefore be different from the one estimated through the partial equilibrium&#13;
methodology. Furthermore, within the latter approach, different results will&#13;
be obtained depending on the treatment of non-tradeables, Accordingly, the&#13;
structure of nominal sectoral protection generated as a result of the&#13;
equalization of effective protection rates across sectors will vary with the&#13;
concept of effective protection used as a benchmark in the calculations.&#13;
The ERPG indicator is clearly the adequate measure of effective&#13;
protection from the point of view of consistency with the general equilibrium&#13;
framework of the CGE model. However, it suffers from an aggregation bias,&#13;
which is essentially due to differences in composition, and therefore to the&#13;
presence of complementarities, between the bundles of domestic and imported&#13;
goods that comprise the composite good at the sez_toral level.   In a fully&#13;
disaggregated CGE model, this bias would disappear, as the ERPG would be&#13;
estimated with respect to close import substitutes only. However, this&#13;
property does not hold in the context ot the 15 sector Ivory Coast model, and&#13;
the ERPG indicator will in general differ substantially from the standard ERP&#13;
that would result from the averaging of ERPs estimated on a product by product&#13;
basis.&#13;
For these reasons, and despite its known weaknesses in a general&#13;
equilibrium context, we decided to retain the Corden ERP masure as an indicator&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
of effective protection in the following experiments (see Chapter 4).&#13;
(v) Trade Substitution and Export Supply Elasticities&#13;
We discuss in this section the determination of the estimates&#13;
retained for the trade substitution elasticities and for the elasticities of&#13;
the export supply functions.&#13;
A plausible range of trade substitution elasticities was first&#13;
determined from cross-sectional evidence based on CGE modelling experience in&#13;
other developing countries. The protected sectors in the model were then&#13;
grouped into three different categories corresponding to high, medium and low&#13;
trade substitution elasticities, on the basis of our knowledge of the product&#13;
composition within each individual sector in the Ivory Coast, Under the&#13;
central set of estimates, which has been retained for all base experiments,&#13;
the medium estimate for trade substitution elasticities is 0.8, indicating&#13;
that a 1.0% change in the relative price of imported to domestic goods induces&#13;
a 0.8% change in the ratio of imported goods to domestic goods in the&#13;
composite commodity demanded by domestic agents. Low and high estimates were&#13;
set at 0.6 and 1.1, respectively.   Two alternative sets of estimates were&#13;
retained for the purposes of the sensitivity analyses, corresponding to the&#13;
high end and the low end of the range of realistic values.&#13;
A similar approach was followed in order to determine the&#13;
elasticities of the export supply functions. A central estimate of 0.5 was&#13;
applied to the base experiments across all sectors where export arbitrage&#13;
occurs, corresponding to the middle range of plausible values. This&#13;
elasticity indicates that a 1.0% change in the relative price of exports to&#13;
domestic goods induces a 0.5% change in the ratio of exports to sales on the&#13;
domestic market by exporters. Two alternative estimates were used for the&#13;
purposes of sensitivity analyses, corresponding to the high end (1.0) and the&#13;
low end (0.25) of realistic values.&#13;

II. POLICY EXPERIMENTS&#13;
CHAPTER 3: EXCHANGE RATE ADJUSTMENTS&#13;
In the first chapter devoted to policy experiments, the short-run&#13;
effects of exchange rate adjustments are considered. In Section 1, we discuss&#13;
the significance of the exchange rate issue in the current economic situation&#13;
of the Ivory Coast. We describe in Section 2 the economic mechanisms involved&#13;
in the experiments where tke exchange rate is adjusted. Finally, in Section&#13;
3, we present the analysis of the experiments.&#13;
1. The Exchange Rate Issue&#13;
As a member of the Franc Zone, the Ivory Coast has had a fixed&#13;
nominal exchange rate vis-a-vis the French Franc since independence. In&#13;
purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms, the exchange rate of the CFA Franc (CFAF)&#13;
as against the currencies of the Ivory Coast's tradling partners remained&#13;
relatively stable until the mid-1970s. Taking 1973 as a base, the index of&#13;
the PPP exchange rate averaged 97.6% from 1960-1974, fluctuating within a&#13;
range of about 6.0%. However, it appreciated sharply after 1975, as a result&#13;
of the acceleration in the rate of domestic inflation, especially following&#13;
the coffee and cocoa boom in 1974. In comparison to 1973, the rate of&#13;
appreciation reached 28.7% in 1977 and remained at about 25% until 1980. A&#13;
depreciation in PPP terms with respect to the 1977-1980 situation then started&#13;
in 1980. This was mainly the result of the slowdown in the rate of domestic&#13;
inflation after 1980, and of currency movements within the European Monetary&#13;
System and between those currencies and the US dollar. Accordingly, in the&#13;
first quarter of 1983, the degree of overvaluation of the CFAF was estimated&#13;
at only 17.5% as opposed to its 1960-1974 value.&#13;
Nonetheless, the PPP index, which estimates the degree of&#13;
appreciation of the exchange rate resulting from differences in inflation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36&#13;
rates at home and abroad, is not an adequate indicator of the overvaluation of&#13;
the domestic currency as it does not take into account the effects of changes&#13;
in terms of trade and transfer payments on the country's foreign exchange&#13;
position.&#13;
The adequate measure is the equilibrium exchange rate, defined as&#13;
the exchange rate that equals the supply and demand of foreign exchange during&#13;
a certain period for a given set of trade taxes and subsidies. Changes in the&#13;
equilibrium exchange rate can be decomposed into several factors.   Among the&#13;
most important are differential inflation, changes in terms of trade, and&#13;
changes in transfer movements with the rest of the world. 1/&#13;
Several factors suggest that the CFA Franc has in fact remained&#13;
largely overvalued from the point of view of the Ivory Coast, in spite of the&#13;
apparent improvement shown by the PPP index. The reduction in inflation&#13;
differentials with the country's trading partners, which led to the&#13;
depreciation of the PPP index starting in 1980, was accompanied by a sharp&#13;
deterioration in the terms of trade, estimated at 48.6% between 1977 and 1982,&#13;
of which 16.9% during the 1980-82 period. Between 1977 and 1982, the current&#13;
account balance deteriorated rapidly, as a result of both rising interest&#13;
payments on external public debt and continued increases in salary remittances&#13;
abroad.  The former increased from 4.1% of exports of goods and services in&#13;
1977 to 21.0% in 1982, while the latter grew from US$ 344.2 million in 1977&#13;
(or 14.3% of exports of goods and services) to US$ 436.1 million in 1982 (or&#13;
19.2% of exports of goods and services).   These factors also led to a&#13;
deterioration of the overall balance, which turned into deficit starting in&#13;
1979. By the end of 1982, continued deficit of the overall balance of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
payments resulted in a negative net foreign assets position of US$ 1.2&#13;
billion.&#13;
During the rest of the decade, current price projections indicate no&#13;
further deterioration of the Ivory Coast's terms of trade. Moreover,&#13;
reductions in imports following the increase in domestic oil production, and&#13;
the possibility of oil export surpluses of 500,000 tons a year after 1987, are&#13;
likely to help the current account situation. However, it is not clear&#13;
whether this improvement will result in a corresponding reduction of the&#13;
degree of overvaluation of the CFA Franc. The availability of oil surpluses&#13;
could presumably lead to an increase in the inflation differential with&#13;
respect to the country's trading partners. Furthermore, despite these&#13;
increases in domestic oil production, continued deficits of the overall&#13;
balance are projected over the rest of the decade. The debt burden in&#13;
comparison to exports of goods and services will continue to increase until at&#13;
least 1985, and lower inflows of external public capital resulting from sharp&#13;
cuts in the public investment program until 1985 will not be matched by&#13;
corresponding reductions in the current account deficits, at least under the&#13;
present set of trade policies.&#13;
Given the position of the country within the Franc Zone, many&#13;
difficulties arise in addressing the exchange rate issue. The exchange rate&#13;
policy of the Ivory Coast must be understood within the framework of the&#13;
Western Africa Monetary Union, and any modification of the parity of the CFA&#13;
Franc with respect to the French Franc should be discussed in that context.&#13;
However, alternative arrangements are possible within the existing&#13;
institutional framework. In particular, it should be recognized that there is&#13;
no conceptual incompatibility between the continuation of the convertibility&#13;
agreements and the introduction of periodical parity modifications within the&#13;
Franc zone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Ultimately, the analysis of flexible exchange rate policies should&#13;
be carried out from a medium to long-term perspective in a dynamic&#13;
framework. However, in our opinion, comparative statics experiments carried&#13;
out with a general equilibrium model can provide a useful first contribution&#13;
toward a better understanding of this issue from several points of view.&#13;
First, there is a need to address the issue of overvaluation beyond simple&#13;
estimates of the PPP index. Second, there is a need to quantify the impact of&#13;
flexible exchange rate policies on the economy as a whole. Third, it may be&#13;
useful to concentrate on the analysis of the impact of such policies in the&#13;
context of a single period model, before expanding the analysis to take into&#13;
account dynamic effects.&#13;
2. Economic Mechanisms Involved&#13;
The analysis of flexible exchange rate policies presented in the&#13;
next section consists of simulating the response of the economy to a tighten-&#13;
ing of the foreign exchange constraint. This is done under alternative&#13;
hypotheses concerning key behavioral parameters of the model, such as the&#13;
response of exporters to changes in relative prices at home and abroad, or&#13;
under alternative foreign trade and incentive policies, particularly&#13;
concerning quantitative import restrictions in key sectors.&#13;
Starting from a position of an overall balance of payments deficit,&#13;
a tightening of the foreign exchange constraint calls for a devaluation, which&#13;
primarily results in a change in the relative price of imported to domestic&#13;
goods, and in a reduction in the available savings to the economy. The&#13;
overall net effects will depend on "sectoral tradeablility" characteristics&#13;
and on the pattern of demand adjustment following the reduction in the inflow&#13;
of foreign savings.&#13;
A devaluation raises the relative domestic price of close import&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39&#13;
substitutes and exportables, and lowers the relative domestic price of less&#13;
tradeable commodities or commodities that behave as import complements. On&#13;
the production side, this relative price change induces an expansion in the&#13;
production of exports and import substitutes, and a contraction in the&#13;
production of less tradeable commodities and import complements. On the&#13;
demand side, an expenditure switching effect takes place, followed by a&#13;
reduction of domestic demand for exportables and import substitutes, and an&#13;
increase in domestic demand for non-tradeables and import complements.&#13;
Overall, the effects of the devaluation on the sectoral net prices structure&#13;
will depend on a number of "sectoral tradeability" characteristics, namely:&#13;
the share of exports in total production; the share of imports in total&#13;
domestic demand; the ratio of imports to intermediate inputs; and trade&#13;
substitution elasticities. A devaluation raises the relative net price of&#13;
sectors with high export shares; has a larger impact on sectoral net prices,&#13;
the higher the share of imports in total demand; lowers the relative net price&#13;
of sectors with a high ratio of imports to intermediate inputs; and tends to&#13;
raise (lower) the net price in sectors with high (low) trade substitution&#13;
elasticities, or import substitutes (complements). Sectoral tradeability&#13;
indicators for each sector are given in Annex 3. The extent to which these&#13;
effects mutually reinforce or counterbalance each other can be determined only&#13;
in a general equilibrium framework.&#13;
The pattern of demand adjustment following the contraction of the&#13;
inflow of foreign savings is the other key determinant of the structure of&#13;
relative net prices under a flexible exchange rate regime. When the model is&#13;
supposed to be savings-driven (see Chapter 2.3), investment adjusts to match&#13;
available total savings (i.e., domestic and foreign). Although the&#13;
expenditure-reducing effect of the devaluation may also induce a contraction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
in real private and public consumption, the burden of adjustment falls&#13;
primarily on investment demand, resulting in a downward pressure in the&#13;
relative price of capital goods as opposed to consumer goods. On the other&#13;
hand, when the investment level is to be maintained, savings ad just to bring&#13;
the domestic gap in line with the foreign exchange gap. In this case, the&#13;
burden of adjustment falls on consumption, both public and private, and the&#13;
expenditure-reducing effect of the devaluation is relatively weaker on&#13;
investment. This results in downward pressure on the relative price of&#13;
consumer goods and capital goods.&#13;
Finally, the impact of the devaluation will depend on quantitative&#13;
import restrictions. The adoption of an import quota will tend to reduce the&#13;
impact of the devaluation on the net price in the sectors, in cases where&#13;
quantitative import restrictions are binding. The devaluation will result in&#13;
this case in a reduction of the import premium accruing to license holders.&#13;
Correspondingly, in contrast to a scenario where quotas remain binding, the&#13;
removal of the quota in conjunction with a move to a flexible exchange rate&#13;
regime will result in stronger sectoral net price changes, as a larger&#13;
devaluation will be required to reach balance of payments equilibrium, and as&#13;
its effects will be directly transmitted to import prices.&#13;
Just as the prices of outputs in all sectors are relative prices,&#13;
the exchange rate is treated as a relative price in the CGE model. In this&#13;
sense, changes in the exchange rate refer to changes above the differential&#13;
between domestic and world inflation. A change in the nominal exchange rate&#13;
from period to period just offsetting differential world and domestic&#13;
inflation rates would correspond to a constant real (or price level deflated)&#13;
exchange rate. Only if the change in the exchange rate exceeds (falls skort&#13;
of) this differential will there be a depreciation (appreciation) in the real&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;

3. Analysis of the Experiments&#13;
In this section, we analyze the impact on the economy of a&#13;
tightening of the foreign exchange constraint in a situation where the&#13;
exchange rate is allowed to adjust. First, we present the results of a base&#13;
experiment carried out under a central set of estimates for trade substitution&#13;
and export supply elasticities. We then turn to a series of sensitivity&#13;
experiments realized under different assumptions on these elasticities. Next,&#13;
we discuss an experiment carried out under an alternative assumption&#13;
concerning the adjustment of the investment savings gap. Finally, we present&#13;
the results of an experiment where balance of payments equilibrium is imposed&#13;
as a constraint on the economy.&#13;
These experiments have been carried out under the assumption that&#13;
produicer prices in the agricultural sector are kept constant in real terms in&#13;
the short run. This assumption resulted in only marginal variations&#13;
(generally less than one percent across experiments) in the corresponding&#13;
value added prices following the adjustments in the exchange rate. Also,&#13;
import quotas have been assumed to remain in affect throughout the&#13;
experiments. In the interpretation of this section's results, it must however&#13;
be kept in mind that the effects of the removal of quotas may be significant,&#13;
as shown in Chapter 5.&#13;
The objective of all but the last experiments of this section is a&#13;
reduction by a half of balance of payment deficit. Such a reduction of CFAF&#13;
70 billion out of an overall deficit of CFAF 145 billion in the reference year&#13;
corresponds to an ex-ante decrease of foreign savings by 3.5% of GDP. This&#13;
undoubtedly represents a drastic stabilization effort which, nonetheless,&#13;
remains in line with the targets set under the original IMF program (see&#13;
chapter 1.2). In the last experiment, the balance of payment objective is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
zero deficit. The objective of this experiment is not to simulate the&#13;
adjustment of the economy to an operational balance of payments target in the&#13;
short-run, but rather to estimate the theoretical equilibrium exchange rate as&#13;
defined above.&#13;
(i) Base Experiment&#13;
The base experiment has been carried out with the central set of&#13;
estimates for the trade substitution and export supply elasticities. It shows&#13;
that the balance of payment target can be achieved with a real devaluation&#13;
estimated at 9.5%, accompanied by a decrease in GDP at market prices of&#13;
2.0%. The most important elements of the adjustment of the structure of the&#13;
economy called for in the experiment are: a substantial improvement in public&#13;
finance; a sharp decrease of household income and consumption; and dramatic&#13;
shifts in the structure of relative prices and external trade. Detailed&#13;
results are presented in table 3.1 below.&#13;
The decrease in GDP and the dramatic change in its structure can be&#13;
seen as essentially the result of the decline in investment (-6.6%) following&#13;
the reduction of the inflow of foreign savings in the economy induced by the&#13;
reduction in the balance of payments deficit. Construction value-added&#13;
declines by a sharp 6.0% and services value-added drops by 1.9%, while&#13;
agriculture remains practically constant and industry declines by 0.9%.&#13;
Similar changes occur in the structure of output. Illustrative of the impact&#13;
of investment demand, for instance, is the fact that the output of the&#13;
engineering industry sector declines (-2.6%), because the increase in its&#13;
exports (+1.0%) and the decrease in competing imports (-6.9%) which are&#13;
induced by the devaluation cannot offset the decline in demand for equipment&#13;
resulting from the lower investment level. By contrast, output remains&#13;
practically constant in food processing and textiles (+0.1% and 0.5%,&#13;
respectively).&#13;

The public finance effect is quite significant, as government&#13;
revenue increases by 4.8%, resulting in a substantial increase in public&#13;
savings (+25.8%). This is the result of the combination of two important&#13;
factors.&#13;
The first factor is the increase in the Stabilization Fund surplus&#13;
by 32.4%, bringing its share in government revenue from 16.1% to 20.3%. This&#13;
results directly from the increased differential between export and domestic&#13;
prices of agricultural products following the devaluation, as export prices in&#13;
domestic currency terms increase more than proportionately by comparison with&#13;
domestic producer prices. This effect demonstrates the importance of the&#13;
Stabilization Fund mechanism, not only because of its obvious role as a source&#13;
of revenue for the public budget, but also because of its impact on the&#13;
overall level of investment through the public savings effect.   In particular,&#13;
if the additional revenue generated by the exchange rate adjustment had been&#13;
completely passed on to producers, the pattern of demand would have been quite&#13;
different, and the evolution of the economy would have been substantially&#13;
affected through the impact on investment and capital formation.&#13;
The second factor is the 2.5% increase in tariff receipts&#13;
originating from the fact that the decline in the volume of imports is more&#13;
than offset by the increase in their domestic price due to the devaluation.&#13;
The result is an overall increase in government revenue despite a&#13;
slight fall in direct tax receipts (-4.5%). Since current public expenditures&#13;
(i.e. consumption and transfers) are assumed to remain constant in nominal&#13;
terms in the short-run, this translates into a substantial increase in&#13;
govermnent savings. However, this increase is smaller than that of public&#13;
income since, on the expenditure side, the domestic currency value of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
transfers abroad rises as a consequence of the devaluation. -&#13;
This increase in government savings raises the share of public&#13;
savings in total savings from 14.4% to 18.8% and nearly offsets the decrease&#13;
in foreign and domestic savings (-10.0% and -4.5% respectively) which occurs&#13;
as a result of the reduction in the balance of payments deficit and of the&#13;
decrease in household income. Overall, nominal savings decline only by 3.6%,&#13;
and the drop in real investment results mostly from the increase in capital&#13;
goods prices.&#13;
As a direct consequence of the decrease in GDP, nominal household&#13;
income drops by 5.1%. Since households remittances abroad are also fixed in&#13;
foreign currency terms, -/ disposable income is further deteriorated and&#13;
domestic savings and consumption by households are reduced by 4.5% and 4.4%&#13;
respectively in nominal terms.&#13;
Relative sectoral value-added pries are substantially modified as a&#13;
result of the exchange rate adjustment, following the marked shifts in demand&#13;
and supply patterns, and also following the structure of the sectoral&#13;
tradeability indicators (see 3.2 above). Investment goods (engineering goods&#13;
and construction) as well as less tradeable sectors (such as utilities or&#13;
services) see their relative prices drop sharply, whereas the prices of more&#13;
tradeable sectors increase significantly.&#13;
Finally, the pattern of foreign trade is significantly modified, as&#13;
the economy becomes more export oriented and less import dependent.&#13;
Industrial exports increase by 5.0%, inreasing the ratio of export to&#13;
domestic output by 3.4% with respect to its reference year value, while the&#13;
1/ To the extent that those transfers represent interest payments, this&#13;
represents a reasonable assumption.&#13;
2/ Realistic in the short-run, this assumption will have to be modified in a&#13;
longer-run analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 6-&#13;
ratio of imports to domestic supply decreases by 7.2%, as a direct result of&#13;
the changes in relative prices induced by the adjustment.&#13;
(ii) Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
The role of trade elasticities in the adjustment has been emphasized&#13;
in section 2 of this chapter. As these elasticities determine the extent of&#13;
export and import movements following changes in relative prices, it is&#13;
important to assess the sensitivity of the preceding results to the value of&#13;
these elasticities. Whereas the base experiment has been carried out under a&#13;
medium set of values for trade and export elasticities (see the numerical&#13;
values in chapter 2.2), experiments 1 and 2 presented in this subsection have&#13;
been carried out assuming, respectively, a high and a low export response,&#13;
keeping trade elasticities at their medium values. Experiments 3 and 4 have&#13;
been carried out with high and low trade elasticities, keeping export&#13;
elasticities constant. The results are presented in the first five columns of&#13;
Table 3.2 below.&#13;
The experiments show the expected effects of different assumptions&#13;
on the elasticities as to the size of exchange rate adjustments, increase in&#13;
exports and reduction in imports. However, all experiments result in a&#13;
similar contraction of GDP. Moreover, they confirm the importance of the&#13;
public finance effect, which prevents a sharp drop in real investment&#13;
following the increase in public savings.&#13;
The size of the exchange rate adjustments is consistent with the&#13;
assumptions on elasticities, increasing as export and trade elasticities&#13;
decrease. The required devaluation varies between 7.6% and 11.2%, indicating&#13;
a reasonable estimate for the exchange rate adjustment in the 8 to 10% range.&#13;
The shifts in the trade structure vary accordingly. The ratio of imports&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
to domestic supply varies between -7.2% and -6.1%, and the ratio of export to&#13;
domestic output ranges from +0.8% to +2.0%.&#13;
The change in investment varies significantly across experiments,&#13;
ranging from -7.7% to -5.8%. This is a direct consequence of the public&#13;
finance effet previously described: the larger the devaluation, the larger the&#13;
surplus of the Stabilization Fund (between +25.8% and +38.3% the larger the&#13;
increase in public savings (between +16.7% and +33.3% and therefore the larger&#13;
real investment.&#13;
Finally, it is interesting to note that the level of real GDP&#13;
obtained in the different experiments is of similar magnitude. This is&#13;
because the various effects of exchange rate adjustments on GDP tend to&#13;
compensate one another. For instance, the experiment with the lowest exchange&#13;
rate adjustment is also the one which is done under the assumption of a high&#13;
export response (explaining why a lower exchange rate adjustment is needed),&#13;
involving a relatively higher value-added in the industrial sector, which&#13;
compensates for the relatively lower value added in construction anld services&#13;
following the decrease in investment demand. Overall, this experiment results&#13;
in a GDP level comparable to the one obtained under the experiment with the&#13;
highest investment rate.&#13;
(iii) Exchange Rate Adjustment with Constant Real Investment&#13;
While we assumed in the previous analysis that the level of&#13;
investment adjusts to available savings, in the following equipment government&#13;
adjusts its savings rate in order to sustain a given level of overall real&#13;
investment (See Table 3-2; column 6). This policy is preferable to the other&#13;
ones presented in this chapter as it results in a higher GDP level and an&#13;
increase in households' real income with an exchange rate adjustment of the&#13;
same order of magnitude. However, this result is achieved only through a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 9-&#13;
severe reduiction in current public expenditure, which would undoubtedly be&#13;
difficult to implement in the short run. A maintained real investment level&#13;
and a fall in current public expenditure are the two elements which explain&#13;
the central results of this experiment, namely an increase in construction&#13;
value-added which drives overall GDP, a drop in utilities and services sectors&#13;
activities and prices, and an increase in household real income.&#13;
The much larger demand for investment goods sectors, as compared&#13;
with the base experiment, explains why the structure of GDP is distorted in&#13;
favor of construction, which declines only by 0.3% by comparison with a drop&#13;
of 6.0% in the base experiment. It also explains the slightly better&#13;
performance of the industrial sector which, as a result of the substantial&#13;
increase in engineering industries and construction materials value added,&#13;
increases slightly above its reference year value. As a consequence, overall&#13;
GDP is higher than in the base experiment, yielding a higher nominal household&#13;
income.&#13;
The reduction in government expenditure is a direct consequence of&#13;
the assumption made in the model concerning the savings-investment adjustment&#13;
under an investment-driven regime, i.e. that public savings adjust in order to&#13;
match the desired level of investment (see chapter 2.3). Thus, in this&#13;
experiment, public savings increase by 74.0% above their reference year value,&#13;
whereas the corresponding figure was 25.8% under the base experiment. Since&#13;
the increase in public revenue due to the devaluation (Stabilization Fund and&#13;
tariff effects) is not sufficient to meet the additional savings required,&#13;
government expenditure make up for the difference, resulting in a drop of&#13;
22.8%. As government expenditure represents about 16% of the demand for the&#13;
utilities sector and 9% of the demand for the services sector, this explains&#13;
the drop in output, prices and value-added of these two sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
Overall, these two types of effects (boost of investment goods&#13;
sectors and drop of utilities and services) compensate each other in terms of&#13;
import and price levels. Compared with the base experiment, the increase in&#13;
imports required by the larger investment is almost offset by the lower&#13;
services imports.   Consequently, the exchange rate adjustment is of the same&#13;
order of magnitude (+9.5%) in both cases. A comparable price level is also&#13;
obtained under both experiments, as the increase in investment goods prices is&#13;
compensated by a decrease in prices for utilities and services, while the&#13;
exchange rate is devalued by a similar amount. This, in turn, explains why&#13;
the increase in nominal household income can be translated into an increase in&#13;
real income, leaving households better off in this experiment.&#13;
(iv) Equilibrium Exchange Rate&#13;
This last experiment simulates the response of the economy to a&#13;
hypothetical situation where balance of payments equilibrium would need to be&#13;
reestablished in the short run. The objective of the experiment is not to&#13;
represent an adjustment to an "operational" balance of payment target, but co&#13;
obtain an estimate of the real equilibrium exchange rate at a given point in&#13;
time under a central set of estimates concerning trade substitution and export&#13;
supply elasticities. The results of the experiment are presented in Table&#13;
3.2, column 7.&#13;
The required equilibrium of the balance of payments is achieved&#13;
through a 31.1% of devaluation, which is accompanied by a 6.6% drop in real&#13;
GDP at market prices and by a 20.5% drop in real investment. The adjustment&#13;
of the trade balance is achieved essentially through a substantial decrease in&#13;
imports (-19.4%), while total exports grow only by 3.9%. The growth in&#13;
industrial exports (+14.5%) is significantly higher compared to the result&#13;
obtained under the base experiment. As expected, the higher devaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
results in a sharp increase in import prices and in capital goods prices,&#13;
while the decline in value added net prices is more pronounced than under the&#13;
base experiment.&#13;
The estimate of the equilibrium exchange rate should not be&#13;
interpreted as the rate of devaluation which would be needed in order to&#13;
achieve balance of payment equilibrium within a given year. First, as shown&#13;
in the previous analysis, this estimate is sensitive to the values assigned to&#13;
trade substitution elasticities and export supply elasticities.    Second, the&#13;
estimate refers only to the real devaluation needed to yield the required&#13;
adjustment. Any estimation of the rate of nominal devaluation needed to&#13;
achieve the balance of payment target would require to take into account the&#13;
impact of the inflation differential with the rest of the world, which would&#13;
in turn require to incorporate monetary policy, credit mechanisms, and the&#13;
process of financial intermediation in the model.    However, as an estimate of&#13;
the marginal value of foreign exchange for the Ivory Coast under the existing&#13;
system of incentives, it provides a second best shadow price of foreign&#13;
exchange in that reference year.&#13;

CHAPTER 4: TARIFFS AND EXPORT SUBSIDIES REFORMS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR&#13;
In this chapter, we analyze the short term general equilibrium&#13;
effects of changes in the tariff and export incentive structure in the&#13;
industrial sector. In section 1, we discuss the relevance of these policy&#13;
reforms in the context of the structural adjustment program in the Ivory&#13;
Coast. We analyze in section 2 the economic mechanisms involved. Finally, in&#13;
section 3, we present the experiments.&#13;
1. Policy Issues&#13;
Up to the mid-seventies, the development of the industrial sector&#13;
took place in the context of a relatively simple system of incentives. This&#13;
system was based on moderate tariffs that applied fairly uniform protection&#13;
between the different branches of activity, without reliance on quantitative&#13;
import restrictions.&#13;
This situation was modified by the 1973 tariff reform,which resulted&#13;
in a more escalated tariff scale according to the degree of processing, and in&#13;
substantial distortions in the degree of effective protection given to&#13;
particular industrial branches. Average effective tariff protection&#13;
coefficients (ETP) have been estimated on the basis of the average nominal&#13;
tariff protection coefficients derived both under the pre-1973 and the post-&#13;
1973 tariff schedules.1 Between 1971 and 1978, the average effective tariff&#13;
protection coefficient for the industrial sector as a whole increased from&#13;
1.39 to 1.76. The subsectoral ETP varied, in 1971, between 1.19 and 2.06&#13;
whereas the interal widened between 0.92 to 2.18 in 197 , with, for instance,&#13;
increases of the order of 30% in canning and food processing and in grain&#13;
products.&#13;
1/  See M. Noel [1982]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 3-&#13;
Starting in 1975, the proliferation of quantitative import&#13;
restrictions induced increasing distortions in the structure of effective&#13;
protection across subsectors. Empirical studies conducted at the firm level&#13;
showed a high degree of correlation between the pattern of effective&#13;
protection and domestic resource cost estimates, revealing considerable&#13;
distortions in the allocation of resources toward activities that earn (or&#13;
save) foreign exchange at a high cost in terms of domestic resources, and away&#13;
from activities which could have developed at a comparative advantage for the&#13;
country.&#13;
Increasing protection for sales on the domestic market resulted in a&#13;
growing bias against exports. Estimates based on 1978 firm-level data showed,&#13;
for instance, a bias against exports of 54% in spinning, weaving and dyeing,&#13;
122% in other textile products, and 101% in canned and processed food.&#13;
In this context, the Government is undertaking a comprehensive&#13;
reform of the system of industrial incentives, based on three main elements:&#13;
(i) a complete revision of the customs tariff, with the objective to equalize&#13;
effective tariff protection coefficient across industrial subsectors and,&#13;
within each subsector, between the various stages of processing; (ii) the&#13;
implementation of an across-the-board subsidy on export value added for&#13;
manufactured goods, designed to compensate for the degree of effective tariff&#13;
protection on domestic sales; and (iii) the removal of quantitative import&#13;
restrictions and their replacement by temporary import surcharges that will&#13;
decline over time.&#13;
The analysis of these reforms in a general equilibrium framework is&#13;
of particular relevance for policy makers, who have to take into account their&#13;
impact on internal and external equilibria. Ultimately, this analysis should&#13;
be carried out in an intertemporal context using a dynamic general equilibrium&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
model. However, at this stage, the estimation of the main macroeconomic&#13;
adjustments triggered by the reforms in a static general equilibrium framework&#13;
is of considerable interest as a first step toward improving on analyses&#13;
carried out in a partial equilibrium context.&#13;
2. Economic Mechanisms&#13;
The analysis carried out in the following experiments consists in&#13;
simulating the response of the economy to a tightening of the foreign exchange&#13;
constraint under a fixed exchange rate regime.   The adjustment is achieved&#13;
through a change in the average level and in the structure of tariffs and&#13;
through an across-the-board subsidy on export value added in the industrial&#13;
sector, together with the removal of binding quotas. In line with the policy&#13;
reform, the change in tariffs is constrained to yield equal effective tariff&#13;
protection across industrial sectors. At the same time, the across-the-board&#13;
subsidy on export value added is constrained to equal the effective tariff&#13;
protection rate, in order to neutralize the bias against exports inherent in&#13;
the system of tariff protection.&#13;
As a result of the reduction in the inflow of savings from the rest&#13;
of the world, the economy must achieve a corresponding reduction in its trade&#13;
balance deficit through a decrease in imports anid an increase in exports.   The&#13;
decrease in imports results (i) from an expenditure-reducing effect, due to&#13;
the impact on domestic demand of the reduction of foreign savings, and (ii)&#13;
from an expenditure- and output-switching effect which results, under a fixed&#13;
exchange rate regime, from the change in the level of tariffs.   This switching&#13;
effect could be achieved through an across-the-board increase in nominal&#13;
tariffs for industrial products.   In s ch an experiment, the structure of&#13;
effective tariff protection across sectors would be modified only slightly&#13;
after the adjustment, and the switching effect would result primarily in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
modification in the structure of output and demand between tradeables and non-&#13;
tradeables, and to a lesser extent between tradeables themselves.   On the&#13;
other hand, the expenditure reducing effect can have a substantial impact on&#13;
the structure of output and demand both between tradeables and non-tradeables&#13;
and between tradeables themselves, depending on the type of adjustment&#13;
assumed. In a savings driven model, the level of investment is reduced in&#13;
line with available savings, and the burden of adjustment falls on investment&#13;
goods. In an investment driven model, domestic savings must increase in line&#13;
with the level of investment at the expense of consumption, and the burden of&#13;
adjustment falls on consumption goods.&#13;
In the following experiments, the switching effect is achieved&#13;
through an overall increase in the average nominal tariff level in the&#13;
industrial sector and through substantial changes in the structure of nominal&#13;
tariffs to satisfy the constraint of equalization cf effective tariff&#13;
protection across subsectors. As a result, the switching effect by itself&#13;
will entail larger changes in the structure of output than in the previous&#13;
case, in addition to the change induced by the expenditure reducing effect.&#13;
The change in the structure of tradeables depends, as under ' 5&#13;
flexible exchange rate adjustment, on the tradeability characteristics of&#13;
individual sectors.  In the case of an import substitute, an increase in the&#13;
tariff rate will decrease the demand for imports of that good and increase the&#13;
demand for its domestic substitute.   In the extreme case of a complementary&#13;
good, (not present in the model), the demand for this good would not decrease&#13;
and the expenditure devoted to this good would be higher, at the expense of&#13;
other goods.&#13;
Changes in the level of tariffs will induce changes in tariff&#13;
revenue for the government, the direction of the change depending on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5 6-&#13;
relative volume and price effects. In turn, this change will induce a&#13;
proportionate adjustment in another iten of the govermnent budget, with the&#13;
net impact on the economy depending on the type of adjustment retained&#13;
(consumption, transfer, savings).&#13;
Contrary to a change in the level of tariffs, the introduction of an&#13;
across-the-board subsidy on export value added does not modify directly the&#13;
structure of domestic prices. The effects of the subsidy work through the&#13;
possibilities of arbitrage between domestic and export markets for producers&#13;
of manufactured goods. The value added subsidies make exports more profitable&#13;
and will therefore generate a shift of production towards export markets, at&#13;
the expense of domestic sales. This will be accompanied by a change in the&#13;
level of production since the net price for exporters increases. As production&#13;
increases, households' income and demand increase. The combined effects of&#13;
this change in production and demand will affect the domestic price structure.&#13;
The introduction of export subsidies also will induce a change in&#13;
government expenditures. As in the case of tariffs, this change induces a&#13;
proportionate adjustment in another item of the govermnent budget.&#13;
3. Analysis of the Experiments&#13;
In this section, we discuss the effects on the structure of the&#13;
economy of a tightening of the foreign exchange constraint under a fixed&#13;
exchange rate of regime, with the adjustment made through an across-the-board&#13;
tariff-cum-subsidy scheme in the industrial sector. First, we discuss the&#13;
results of the base experiment, in which the model is run under the assumption&#13;
that investment adjusts to available savings in the economy, with a central&#13;
set of estimates for the trade substitution and export supply elasticities.&#13;
We then turn to a discussioni of the sensitivity analysis experiments carried&#13;
out on these trade parameters. Finally, we present an alternative version of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 7-&#13;
the base experiment where real investment is maintained at its original level&#13;
in the reference year. As in the previous chapter, the experiments carried&#13;
out in this section pertain to a reduction in the overall balance of payments&#13;
deficit by one-half.&#13;
(i)  Base Experiment&#13;
Under the central set of estimates for trade substitution and export&#13;
supply elasticities, the balance of payments objective is achieved through an&#13;
increase in the average tariff level of 77.9% (corresponding to an average&#13;
nominal tariff rate of 33.8% compared to 19.1% before the adjustment), and&#13;
through the introduction of an across-the-board subsidy of 57.8% on export&#13;
value added which exactly offsets the effective protection rate obtained in&#13;
the industrial sector, At the same time, the equalization of the Corden&#13;
measure of effective tariff protection rates across industrial subsectors&#13;
results in substantial changes in the nominal tariff structure. Tariff rates&#13;
increase by more than 80% in sectors producing mainly intermediate goods, such&#13;
as chemicals (+117.2%), construction materials (88.2%), and engineering&#13;
industries (+158.8%), compared with relatively smaller increases in&#13;
consumption goods sectors, such as food processing (+7.4%) and textiles&#13;
(+31.6%).&#13;
The adjustment to the balance of payments target is acccmpanied by&#13;
an overall decrease of 2.1% of GDP, a substantial improvement in the public&#13;
finance situation, a decrease in household inccme and consumption, and&#13;
dramatic shifts in the structure of relative prices and external trade. Table&#13;
4-1 presents the main results of the experiment.&#13;

-5 9-&#13;
On the supply side, the decrease in GDP results from the sharp&#13;
decline in construction sector value added (-7.5%) and in services value added&#13;
(-3.6%), which contrast with the quasi-stagnation of agriculture (+0.1%) and&#13;
of the industrial sector (+1.1%). This change in the structure of GDP results&#13;
from the sharp decline of investment (-8.4%) that follows from the reduction&#13;
in the inflow of savings from the rest of the world. The combination of the&#13;
reduction in investment demand and of the sharp changes in the structure of&#13;
trade incentives results in substantial modifications in the structure of&#13;
industrial output. Output and exports expand significantly in food&#13;
processing, textiles, and construction materials. In textiles, the expansion&#13;
of exports and of output is accompanied by a marked increase in imports&#13;
following the removal of quantitative import restrictions. This suggests the&#13;
need for a drastic change in the composition of output inside this sector,&#13;
toward production lines that can compete on export markets with the subsidy&#13;
and away from those that were previously protected by the quotas. By&#13;
contrast, output declines in chemicals and in engineering products, following&#13;
the decline in domestic investment demand, despite the relatively higher&#13;
increase in effective tariff protection in these two sectors.&#13;
The public finance effect of the tariff-cum-subsidy schemes much&#13;
stronger than the effect obtained through the adjustment of the exchange rate,&#13;
and the resulting structure of public finances is also markedly different,&#13;
Government revenue increases by 19.7% as against 4.7% under the experiment&#13;
with exchange rate adjustment, as tariffs receipts increase by 67.8%   from&#13;
CFAF 158 billion to CFAF 266 billion. On the expend ture side, total utlays&#13;
for the export subsidy amount to CFAF 27 billion. As the other components of&#13;
public expenditure remain unchanged, this tznslates into a marked increase in&#13;
government savings, which amount to CFAF 161 billion after the tariff-cum-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 0-&#13;
subsidy adjustment, compared to CFAF 115 billion under the exchange rate&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
This sharp increase in government savings practically offsets the&#13;
decline in foreign savings, resulting in stable level of overall nominal&#13;
savings and investment after the adjustment.   Interestingly, a similar result&#13;
was also obtained when the adjustment was made through a change in the&#13;
exchange rate, although the relative weight of the public savings and of the&#13;
foreign savings adjustments was different in the latter case.   Under the&#13;
exchange rage adjustment, the relatively smaller increase in public savings&#13;
was compensated by a relatively smaller decline in foreign savings, as the&#13;
reduction of foreign savings in dollar terms was partly offset by the&#13;
devaluation. Under both types of adjustment, the decline in real investment&#13;
therefore results mostly from the increase in capital goods prices. Real&#13;
investment declines more sharply under the second type of adjustment, however,&#13;
(-8.4%  as compared to -6.6% under the exchange rate adjustment), as the&#13;
introduction of the tariff-cum-subsidy scheme results in a larger increase in&#13;
capital goods prices (+8.2% as compar,ed to +3.3% under the previous case).&#13;
This is because the nominal tariff on capital goods rises more than&#13;
proportionately with respect to the overall tariff increase in the industrial&#13;
sector as a result of the equalization of effective tariff protection across&#13;
subsectors.&#13;
The structure of sectoral net prices is substantially modified as a&#13;
result of the tariff-cum-subsidy adjustment. These modifications arise from&#13;
the demand and supply effects generated by the adjustment, as well as from the&#13;
change in the nominal tariff structure imposed by the equalization of&#13;
effective tariff protection rates across sectors. By comparison with the&#13;
results obtained under the exchange rate adjustment, changes in sectoral net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
prices ace generally more pronounced, with larger increases obtained for&#13;
textiles (+3.8% vs. +0.3%) and construction materials (+8.9% vs. +1.7%) and&#13;
larger declines obtained in the case of non-tradeable sectors. This is&#13;
because the non-tradeable sectors are negatively affected both by a relatively&#13;
sharper drop in domestic demand and by a relatively higher increase in the&#13;
price of their intermediate inputs, following the change in the structure of&#13;
tariffs, by comparison with the situation resulting from the exchange rate&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
Finally, the trade orientation of the economy is substantially&#13;
affected as a result of the tariff-cum-subsidy adjustment. Industrial exports&#13;
grow by 11.4%, by comparison with a 5.0% increase under the exchange rate&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
(ii) Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
This section presents a series of alternative experiments carried&#13;
out under different sets of trade and export supply elasticities. Experiments&#13;
1 and 2 have been realized assuming a high and a low export response,&#13;
respectively. Experiments 3 and 4 have been done with high and low trade&#13;
elasticities, keeping export elasticities constant. The results are presented&#13;
in Table 4.2 below.&#13;
As in the case of the experiments carried out with exchange rate&#13;
adjustment, the present sensitivity analysis shows the expected effects of the&#13;
assumptions on trade and export supply elasticities on the level of effective&#13;
protection and of expo't-' subsidy across sectors, on the increase in exports,&#13;
and on the decrease in imports.   On the other hand, the contraction of GDP&#13;
following the ad ! istment to lower inflows of foreigni savings is remarkably&#13;
similar across experiments.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
The balance of payments objective is achieved by an increase in the&#13;
average tariff level ranging from +56.6% to +88.0%, wiich results in an&#13;
average effective protection level and in a corresponding export subsidy&#13;
varying between 50.0% and 61.8%. The structure of foreign trade shifts in&#13;
accordance with the variations in the tariff-cum-subsidy scheme, with the&#13;
ratio of imports to domestic output varying between -3.5% and -6.8%, and the&#13;
ratio of exports to domestic output ranging from +3.0% to +5.5%.&#13;
The contraction of GDP following the adjustment to lower inflows of&#13;
foreign savings varies only slightly across experiments (from -1.5% to -2.4%),&#13;
and the corresponding reduction in investment, government consumption and&#13;
private consumption is also remarkably similar, leaving the structure of&#13;
expenditure relatively unchanged across experiments.&#13;
(iii) Tariff-cum-Subsidy Scheme with Constant Real Investment&#13;
The base experiment was carried out under the hypothesis that the&#13;
level of investment adjustments to available savings. In the following&#13;
experiment, we investigate the impact on the economy of a policy in which the&#13;
adjustment to the new balance of payments target is realized through changes&#13;
in tariffs and the i-ntroduction of an export subsidy while mainitaining real&#13;
investment constant,&#13;
By comparison with the base equipment, the adjustment to the new&#13;
balance of payment target is realized through similar changes in tariffs and a&#13;
similar import subsidy level.   The average effective protection level, and the&#13;
corresponding export subsidy level, is estimated at 58.9% compared to 57.8%&#13;
under the base experiment. By contrast, the contraction of GDP is slightly&#13;
less pronounced under this experiment (-1,7%) compared to the base run&#13;
(-2.1%). This is the direct result of the policy option retained in this&#13;
experiment, as maintaining real investment permits to avoid the drop in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 4-&#13;
construction sector obtained under the base experiment (+0.3% vs. -7.5%). In&#13;
turn, the contraction of the services sector is more pronounced under the&#13;
present experiment (-4.8% vs. -3.6%), as a direct result of the very sharp&#13;
decline in government consumption (-33.7%) required to generate the public&#13;
savings needed to sustain the level of public investment.&#13;
The increase in overall government revenue under the present&#13;
experiment is similar to the one obtained in the base run (+21.2% vs. +&#13;
19.7%), and the composition of government revenue remains practically&#13;
unchanged. By contrast, the structure of government expenditure is&#13;
fundamentally changed. Government investment, which represented 27.3% of&#13;
overall government expenditure under the base run, now increases its share to&#13;
37.9%. This implies a sharp increase in government savings, from CFAF 161&#13;
billion to CFAF 226 billion, which is obtained at the expense of a very sharp&#13;
cut in goverrnment consumption, who.se share in overall government expenditure&#13;
declines from 37.1% to 20.9% by comparison with 31.0% under the base run.&#13;
The trade orientation of the econcmy is also quite similar to the&#13;
one obtained under the base run, with the same expansion of exports and the&#13;
same contraction of imports obtained in both cases, while exports of&#13;
industrial products expand slightly more under the present experiment (+12.3%&#13;
vs. 11.4%)e&#13;

CHAPTER 5: QUANTITATIVE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS&#13;
In this chapter, we describe in section 1 the evolution of the&#13;
system of quantitative import restrictions in the Ivory Coast over the last&#13;
decade. In section 2, we briefly discuss the economic mechanisms involved.&#13;
Finally, we preserit in section 3 two experiments designed to estimate the&#13;
impact of the removal of quantitative import restrictions and of their&#13;
replacement by tariffs in a situation allowing for adjustments in the exchange&#13;
rate.&#13;
1. Background I!&#13;
Since the beginning of the sixties, Ivorian authorities have had&#13;
increasing recourse to various non-tariff protection measures, including&#13;
import licensing, import prohibition, and prior import agreements.&#13;
Import licensing and import prohibition were introduced on an ad-hoc&#13;
basis in the course of the sixties. In 1973, there were 86 industrial&#13;
product.s! under import licensing, and 8 others under import prohibition. The&#13;
first comprehensive list (established by Decree in 1975.) contained 310&#13;
industrial products, of which 23 were subject to import prohibition. The&#13;
principal sectors affected were food products, adhesives, textiles and&#13;
clothing, footwear, and certain products of the mechanical and electrical&#13;
industries. Products under import prohibition included coffee beans (except&#13;
arabia), roasted coffee, jute bags and electrical batteries.   By January 1982,&#13;
the number of industrial products under import licensing had grown to 426.&#13;
Using 1981 data as a reference, imports of industrial products under licensing&#13;
1/  See Noel [1982].&#13;
2/ Industrial products have been defined as the 6-digit customs code items&#13;
under the 1973 Customs Nomenclature belonging to branches 6 through 21&#13;
under the National Accounts Nomenclature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
represented CFAF 233.6 billion, or 38.4% of total imports in that same year.&#13;
Products under import licensing are in principle subject to a quota&#13;
by product and a subquota by importer, and the licenses issued until such time&#13;
as the quota is filled. In practice, product quotas are sometimes fixed at a&#13;
level higher than actual import requirements. Also, once an individual&#13;
importer uses up his subquota, an agreement can be reached in some cases with&#13;
the Ministry of Commerce to revise the subquota upward and provide new&#13;
licenses beyond the initial subquota.&#13;
Parallel to the import licensing system, the Ministry of Commerce&#13;
issues a list of products whose importation is subject to prior import&#13;
agreement. For the products belonging to that list, "import intentions" are&#13;
submitted to special import control commissions whose decisions have executive&#13;
force, but may be opposed by the Ministry of Commerce. In January 1982, the&#13;
number of industrial products subject to prior import agreement amounted to&#13;
140. Taking 1981 data as a reference, imports of industrial products under&#13;
prior agreement amounted to CFAF 53.2 billion, or 8.8% of total imports in&#13;
that same year.&#13;
The impact of quantitative import restrictions on nominal protection&#13;
to local manufacturing operations has been studied through the estimation of&#13;
nominal Protection coefficients (NPC) calculated on the basis of firm-level&#13;
data for coffee and cocoa pro;essing, textiles and clothing, and chemicals and&#13;
plastics subsectors in 1980 1/ Among the subsectors under study, the impact&#13;
of the restrictions was by far the highest in textiles and clothing, while an&#13;
average NPC on domestic sales of 1.72, or 60 percentage points higher than the&#13;
corresponding nominal tariff protection coefficient. In the food processing&#13;
1/ See Noel [1982].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
subsector, a high distortion between the NPC e,timate and nominal tariff&#13;
protection was found in the case of coffee processing. By contrast, processed&#13;
cocoa products remained unprotected. However, these findings were not&#13;
sufficient to infer an estimate of the wedge due to quantitative import&#13;
restrictions in this subsector. Finally, distortions remained quite low in&#13;
the chemicals and plastics sub3ector.&#13;
2. Economic Mechanisms&#13;
The imposition of quantitative import restrictions generates two&#13;
types of effects. First, it raises protection for local manufacturing&#13;
operations beyond the protection granted by tariffs. Second, it may result in&#13;
substantial modifications in the distribution of income.&#13;
The first effect generally reflects the objective pursued by&#13;
governments faced with pressures for rapid action to safeguard domestic&#13;
manufacturing operations from foreign competition.   However, goveranents do&#13;
not always recognize the costs involved in protecting local industry through&#13;
quantitative import restrictions. First, quotas are generally imposed on an&#13;
ad-hoc basis, resulting in substantial distortions in incentives and therefore&#13;
in the allocation of resources in the econony. Second, the administration of&#13;
the quotas system is itself costly. Third, parallel markets for import&#13;
licenses may develop, generating costs for private finns obliged to divert&#13;
real resources in order to obtain the licenses. Fourth, although the&#13;
imposition of quotas is generally presented as temporary, it generally becomes&#13;
very difficult to phase-out such a system, in particular due to the resulting&#13;
rents of situation.&#13;
The imposition of a quota system generally results in the private&#13;
appropriation of the revenue that would have been generated for the government&#13;
by its tariff equivalent. This is the incane distribution effect of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 8 -&#13;
quantitative import restrictions. In the case of the Ivory Coast, available&#13;
evidence shows that this effect was quite substantial in the case of textile&#13;
products. The wedge between domestic prices and world prices plus tariffs&#13;
resulting from the imposition of quotas in the textiles sector generated a&#13;
rent was estimated at CFAF 24 billion in 1980, or about 5% of government&#13;
revenue in that same year.&#13;
3. Analysis of the Experiments&#13;
In this section, we analyze the impact of the removal of quotas in a&#13;
situation where the exchange rate is allowed to adjust in response to a&#13;
tightening of the flow of foreign savings.   Two alternative experiments have&#13;
been carried out in this framework. The first experiment simulates the impact&#13;
on the economy of a reduction in the balance of payments deficit by one-half&#13;
when quotas in the textiles sector are replaced by import surcharges so as to&#13;
yield the same level of imports as in the situation with quotas. The second&#13;
experiment simulates this impact when quotas are removed in the textiles&#13;
sector without compensating import surcharges.&#13;
Under the first experiment, the real devaluation required to achieve&#13;
the balance of payments target is estimated at 10.9%, slightly above the level&#13;
obtained under the base experiment. The tariff surcharge needed to obtain the&#13;
same protective effect as the quota in the textiles sector is estimated at&#13;
34.6%, yielding an increase in the overall tariff rate from 35.6% to 70.2% in&#13;
that sector. This results in a 6.0% increase in overall tariff revenues for&#13;
the government, from CFAF 158.6 billion to CFAF 167.9 billion. This effect&#13;
combines with the increase in stabilization fund revenues induced by the&#13;
devaluation to yield a 7.0% increase in government revenue. As a result, the&#13;
contraction in overall investment is significantly less pronounced than under&#13;
the base case (-4.6% vs. -6.6%), and construction sector output declines only&#13;
&#13;

achieve the balance of payments target is estimated at 10.7%, which is&#13;
practically identical to the result obtained in the previous case. However,&#13;
the resulting contraction of GDPs significantly less pronounced by comparison&#13;
with the base experiment (-0.9% vs. -2.0%), as real investment is reduced by&#13;
4.2% as compared to 6.6% under the base case. This results in a slightly&#13;
lower reduction in the volume of private consumption (-4.0% vs. -4.8%).&#13;
At the same time, industrial exports expand more rapidly by&#13;
comparison with the base experiment (+6.8% vs. + 5.0%), while the decline in&#13;
imports is less pronounced (-5.8% vs. -6.9%). This results directly from the&#13;
removal of quotas in the textile sector, which triggers a sharp increase in&#13;
the ratio of imports to domestic output in the sector (+26.7%), or about 24&#13;
percentage points higher than under the base experiment. At the same time,&#13;
exports of textiles expand more rapidly than under the base case (+8.0% vs.&#13;
+ 5.4%).&#13;
The two experiments reveal the impact of the quotas on the&#13;
distribution of income in the economy. Under the first experiment, tariff&#13;
receipts by the government increase by 5.9%, from CFAF 159 billion to CFAF 168&#13;
billion, by comparison with an increase of only 2.5% under the base&#13;
experiment. At the same time, urban high incomes are reduced by 8.5%, from&#13;
CFAF 304 billion to CFAF 278 billion, compared to CFAF 288 billion under the&#13;
base experiment. A similar pattern of adjustment is observed under the second&#13;
experiment. In particular, the increase in tariff receipts is of similar&#13;
magnitude, as the absence of import surcharges is offset by the increase in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
imports following the removal of quotas in the textiles sector.&#13;
The removal of quotas in conjunction with the exchange rate&#13;
adjustment therefore appears to be beneficial for the economy as a whole,&#13;
although it would imply dramatic shifts in the structure of production in the&#13;
sector where quotas are removed, away from production lines which are not&#13;
competitive with imports towards production for exports. An important result&#13;
of this experiment is the significantly lower contraction of GDP and of&#13;
investment following the removal of quotas. This is explained by the higher&#13;
real devaluation required to achieve the balance of payments target. This, in&#13;
turn, is a direct consequence of the removal of quantitative restrictions, as&#13;
this generates in the first round a surge in the imports of the previously&#13;
rationed goods and therefore a larger balance of payments deficit which calls&#13;
for a larger adjustment of the exchange rate. This results in an increase in&#13;
stabilization fund revenues (+36.6% against +32.4% in the base experiment) and&#13;
in tariff revenues (+6.0% against +2.5%). Government savings increase by&#13;
38.3%, so that overall investment remains practically constant in nominal&#13;
terms. The drop in real investment (-4.2%) therefore results almost entirely&#13;
from the increase in capital goods prices (+3.8%), in sharp contrast with the&#13;
base experiment where overall investment contracted by an estimated 6% in real&#13;
terms after the exchange rate adjustment.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
After presenting an overview of the Ivorian economy, we have&#13;
examined the recent economic developments that have led to the present&#13;
financial difficulties and to two consecutive years of recession, and we have&#13;
discussed the main constraints bearing on the future growth of the Ivorian&#13;
economy. Among those constraints, the distortions in the system of incentives&#13;
have progressively hampered the growth potential of the country and have&#13;
reduced its capacity to adjust to rapidly changing external circumstances.&#13;
The acceleration in the rate of domestic inflation after 1975, and the sharp&#13;
deterioration in the terms of trade between 1978 and 1982 led to a substantial&#13;
overvaluation of the CFA Franc vis-a-vis the currencies of Ivory Coast's main&#13;
trading partners. Although major agricultural products withstood the&#13;
overvaluation, thanks to the margins provided by their considerable&#13;
comparative advantage, this was not the case in the industrial sector, where&#13;
these margins are much narrower. In particular, the potential of the&#13;
industrial sector has been affected by the strong discrimination of the system&#13;
of industrial incentives against exports, and by widespread distortions in the&#13;
system of tariff and non-tariff protection between the different branches of&#13;
activity and, within them, between the various stages of product processing.&#13;
This situation is particularly preoccupying, as the most obvious opportunities&#13;
for exports within the protected CEAO markets have already been exploited, and&#13;
as the Ivory Coast has to turn to non-regional markets to restore the growth&#13;
of its industrial base and to generate the foreign exchange earnings required&#13;
to stabilize its current account situation.&#13;
In this context, the policy simulations conducted in the framework&#13;
of the Ivory Coast CGE model take on a particular significance, as they&#13;
provide a strong basis for assessing the macroeconomic and sectoral impact of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-&#13;
major reforms envisioned by the Government in the framework of its structural&#13;
adjustment program.&#13;
Although the arrangements presently in force within the Franc Zone&#13;
prohibit the implementation of an independent exchange rate policy in the&#13;
Ivory Coast, the experiments carried out under conditions where the exchange&#13;
rate is allowed to adjust provide key insights into the magnitude of the&#13;
adjustments required in the economy following a tightening of its foreign&#13;
exchange constraint. In the short run, the devaluation does not induce too&#13;
large a decline in overall GDP, as the impact of the reduction in the net&#13;
inflow of foreign savings is compensated to a large extent by the sharp&#13;
increase in Stabilization Fund revenues and, to a lesser extent, by the&#13;
increase in tariff revenues. By contrast, the devaluation has a strong impact&#13;
on the structure of the economy. Driven by a spur of exports, output expands&#13;
in sectors like food processing, textiles and construction materials, xhile it&#13;
contracts sharply in sectors linked with investment (engineering industries,&#13;
construction) and in less tradeable sectors (utilities, services). Overall,&#13;
the devaluation induces a sharp change in the trade orientation of the&#13;
economy, with substantial increase in exports, especially of industrial goods,&#13;
and reductions in imports that permit to attain the required adjustment of the&#13;
overall balance.&#13;
The second set of experiments provide useful guidelines for the&#13;
design of a tariff-cum-export subsidy scheme as a second best measure to&#13;
achieve the required adjustment of the overall balance. As in the case of the&#13;
flexible exchange rate experiments, the CGE model permits to trace the effects&#13;
of the proposed measures throughout the economy. The experiments show that&#13;
the structure of net prices is substantially modified as a result of the&#13;
change in the nominal tariff structure imposed by the equalization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
effective tariff protection rates across sectors. Another interesting finding&#13;
is that the implementation of the tariff-cum-subsidy scheme results in a&#13;
positive fiscal impact in the short-run.&#13;
The third set of experiments show that the contractionary impact of&#13;
a policy of adjustment with an exchange rate change can be reduced to a&#13;
certain extent by implementing this policy in conjunction with the removal of&#13;
quotas. By contrast, the replacement of quotas by import surcharges does not&#13;
substantially affect the overall growth performance of the econamy. It does,&#13;
however, affect the adjustment required in the corresponding sector. In&#13;
particular, a policy of complete removal of quotas without corresponding&#13;
import surcharges involves dramatic compositional changes in the textile&#13;
sector, with sharp increases in both exports and imports.&#13;
Ultimately, the analysis of the policies envisaged in the above&#13;
experiments should be carried out from a medium to long-term perspective in&#13;
the framework of a dynamic general equilibrium model. Indeed, the timing of&#13;
the supply and demand responses in the economy, as well as the impact of the&#13;
various policies on investment, are rich in dynamic implications. However,&#13;
the investigation of the impact of these policies in a static general&#13;
equilibrium framework presents new and important insights for the policy&#13;
makers faced with the need to design far-reaching reforms in a complex system&#13;
of interdependent economic relationships.&#13;

5.  Final Demand&#13;

- hQusehold consumption demand of good i is, for household category k:&#13;
Cik = aik (1     k k  P                                (21)&#13;
where aik is a constant expenditure share and sk the savings rate of&#13;
household category k.&#13;
-    government consumption is derived in a similar way:&#13;
cGig =jg (1 -       Rg) R                               (22)&#13;
Investment and inventories&#13;
-    investment by sector of destination is:&#13;

public (central government plus public enterprises) and private&#13;
investment, and IPb and IPv the amounts of public and private investment&#13;
investment volume by sector of origin is then:&#13;

Z     Z i X                                              (25)&#13;
6. Equilibrum Conditions&#13;
Product markets&#13;
The equilibrium condition for a given sector i is:&#13;
i    id i  kik ' Cig + 'j Vij + Zi + Z      + E        (26)&#13;
where di is the "domestic use" ratio:&#13;
d1   1/h(Mi/Di,1)                                        (27)&#13;
where h is the CES trade aggregation function.&#13;
-    the equilibrating variable can be either the price or the export&#13;
volume whenever domestic prices are fixed (see chapter 2.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82-&#13;
Investment savings adequation&#13;
The equilibrium condition writes:&#13;
Pb   -=Pv                                               (8&#13;
I   + I   = ESk k + sgRg                                 (28)&#13;
The equilibrating variable is either the public investment level or&#13;
government savings according to the chosen closure rule (see chapter 2.3),&#13;
reflecting the fact that private investment and savings rates have been&#13;
assumed constant.&#13;
Labor markets&#13;
-    equilibrium on a given labor market k requires:&#13;
Lk -      k i                                            (29)&#13;
k&#13;
where Lk is the employed amount of labor of category k. In a full&#13;
employment situatiorn Lk = Lk&#13;
Since nominal wages are supposed constant,    Lk becomes endogenous, making&#13;
unemployment (Lk - L ) the equilibrating variable.&#13;
Balance of payments&#13;
-    the equilibrium equation on the foreign exchange market is:&#13;
.PWiMi - E PWEi Ei - F = 0                               (30)&#13;
where, according to the exchange rate iegime, either capital inflows F are&#13;
exogenous and the exchange rate adjusts in order to realize the&#13;
equilibrium or the exchange rate is exogenous and F is endogenous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83-&#13;
7. Equalization of Effective Rates of Protection&#13;
We use in this model a partial equilibrium concept of effective rate&#13;
of protection (see Chap. 3.3). In the absence of non-tariff barriers and&#13;
price control, the effective rate of protection in a given sector i is defined&#13;
as&#13;
c&#13;
P.  ~a..p&#13;
e  = -                       c                          (31)&#13;
i      P.        c    p&#13;
i   7j&#13;
l+tm    J  J   l+tm&#13;
where      ti  =  nominal tariff rate&#13;
c&#13;
a..  =  technical coefficient expressing direct plus indirect use&#13;
of traded intermediate input j (Corden method)!/&#13;
Given a certain set of values for the sectoral effective&#13;
protections, it is always possible to compute the implied set of nominal&#13;
tariffs by inverting the linear system defined by equation (31).2/ It is&#13;
therefore always possible to compute the set of tariffs which would equalize&#13;
effective protection at a given level.&#13;
The level at i.Jhich the effective rates of protection are equalized&#13;
derives from balance of trade considerations. Since, other things being&#13;
equal, imports are decreasing as effective protection increases, there is a&#13;
direct relationship between the level of protection and the balance of trade&#13;
1/  The Corden method assumes that the elasticity of supply of non-traded&#13;
goods is non-infinite, and includes indirect protection granted to non-&#13;
traded goods as a result of protecting a traded sector in the measure of&#13;
protection of this traded sector. The passage from the observed input-&#13;
output matrix to the adjusted input-output matrix used in (31) results&#13;
from these two assumptions.&#13;
2/ Note that the coefficients of the equation are fixed for a given input-&#13;
output matrix and that the solution is unique.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
deficit. Therefore, in this version of the model, the (uniform) level of&#13;
effective protection is adjusted to realize equilibrium on the foreign&#13;
exchange market, defined by (30). In turn, this level of protection is&#13;
implemented by a set of tariffs computed as described above.&#13;
Value added export subsidies are introduced and made equal to&#13;
effective protection. This additional condition does not change the nature of&#13;
the problem. Since exports are increasing in function of the rate of export&#13;
subsidy, the combination of the tariff and of the subsidy scheme tends to&#13;
reduce the trade deficit further.&#13;

            Short-term responses to trade and incentive
            policies in the Ivory Coast : comparative static simulations
            in a computable general equilibrium model
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Ivory Coast experienced a series of
            external shocks in the last seven years which led to a
            severe deterioration of its financial position and to
            negative growth since 1981. This occurred at a time when the
            growth potential of the country had declined and the ability
            of the economy to adjust was limited by distortions in the
            system of macroeconomic and sectoral incentives. To remedy
            this situation, the government has undertaken a program of
            stringent financial recovery and of structural adjustment,
            articulated around substantial policy reforms. This paper
            analyzes the short-term effects of various trade and
            incentive policies that can be envisaged within this
            program. The analysis is carried out through a series of
            comparative static experiments done in the framework of a
            computable general equilibrium model. Simulations are
            performed to assess the impact of exchange rate adjustments,
            tariff reform, the introduction of an export subsidy and,
            finally, removal of quantitative import restrictions.
