I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND HURRICANE MITCH&#13;
A.   Background&#13;
1.    Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean&#13;
Region, with income per capita of $410 in 1997, over half of its population in poverty,&#13;
one fifth in extreme poverty and weak social indicators. The Nicaraguan highlands cross&#13;
the country from the northwest to the southeast, with several mountain ranges cutting the&#13;
highlands from east to west. A chain of volcanoes, which contribute to earthquake&#13;
activity, rises between the Nicaragua and Managua Lakes and the Pacific coast. The four&#13;
principal rivers (San Juan, Coco, Grande and Escondido), empty into the Caribbean.&#13;
Like its neighbors in Central America, Nicaragua is prone to national disasters, especially&#13;
hurricanes and earthquakes. The most recent natural disaster that caused extensive&#13;
damage was the earthquake that hit Managua in 1972.&#13;
2.    On October 24, Tropical Storm Mitch was upgraded to a hurricane that quickly&#13;
developed into one of the strongest and most damaging storms to ever hit Central&#13;
America. At its height on October 26 and 27, Hurricane Mitch sustained winds of 290&#13;
kph and dumped heavy rains over Central America. Although the winds diminished as&#13;
the hurricane traveled inland over Honduras on October 30, the storm continued to&#13;
produce torrential rains. Mitch inflicted its greatest damage in Nicaragua through severe&#13;
rains that caused extensive flooding and landslides.  The northwestern corner of&#13;
Nicaragua bore the brunt of the storm and a side of the Casitas Volcano collapsed causing&#13;
a massive mudslide that buried ten communities at its base.&#13;
B.   Hurricane Damage&#13;
3.    The areas of Nicaragua most severely affected by the hurricane were the northern&#13;
and northwestern parts of the country, comprising the Departments of Le6n, Chinandega,&#13;
Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Madriz, Matagalpa and Jinotega, and along the Rio Coco in the&#13;
North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN). Severe damage also occurred along the&#13;
Rio Grande de Matagalpa in the South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS), and some&#13;
parts of Managua Department fronting the lake. Preliminary estimates indicate that about&#13;
870,000 people were affected (or almost one in five Nicaraguans), of which 45 percent&#13;
are children. According to the poverty maps prepared by the Social Investment Fund, of&#13;
the 58 poorest municipalities in Nicaragua, 40 are located in the hardest hit departments.&#13;
The departments in the Pacific and Central Regions with the most damage include the&#13;
coffee-growing heartland, and in the Pacific region, they coincide with the former cotton-&#13;
growing areas, which are characterized by extreme levels of deforestation and soil&#13;
depletion. Prolonged exposure to heavy rains renders the denuded hillsides especially&#13;
prone to mudslides-as witnessed most terrifyingly on the slopes of the Casitas Volcano&#13;
on the morning of October 30, when eleven communities were buried by a mudiside.&#13;
Numerous roads were washed out and bridges destroyed, including significant portions of&#13;
the Pan-American Highway, which is Nicaragua's main trunk road and connection to&#13;
neighboring countries. There were direct and indirect impacts on fishing, cattle ranching,&#13;
manufacturing, tourism, commerce and service industries. Another tragic effect of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
mudslides and floods is the washing away of land mines to undetermined areas, posing a&#13;
serious risk to people living in those areas.&#13;
4.    The Atlantic Coast also suffered from Hurricane Mitch, although the pattern of&#13;
damage was different.  About 38,000 people were affected and the damage to&#13;
infrastructure, except for housing, was comparatively light, in part because the region has&#13;
so little infrastructure compared to the rest of the country. The damage to crops,&#13;
however, is large since cultivation mainly takes place around the edge of rivers.&#13;
5.    Estimates of the damage are being prepared by teams of Government, donors and&#13;
UINTDP/ECLAC. Preliminary damage assessments are presented below:&#13;
*  The Human Cost. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 2,870 people died, 950&#13;
were reported missing and 390 injured. As a direct result of the hurricane, an&#13;
estimated 65,300 people were placed in temporary shelters, and 370,600 were&#13;
evacuated. People in the affected areas are also suffering psychologically due to the&#13;
loss of family members and social disruptions.&#13;
o  Transport.  Immediately after the storm, about 70 percent of Nicaragua's road&#13;
network was considered impassable. Several key trunk road connections (at Tipitapa,&#13;
Sebaco, Izapa, Guasaule and Ocotal) were completely cut off, paralyzing transport&#13;
and communications.  Preliminary estimates indicate that two bridges were&#13;
completely destroyed, 49 damaged, and 26 cut off. About 1,500 km of paved roads&#13;
and 6,500 km of unpaved roads were damaged to some extent and many small&#13;
villages, particularly in the north-central and northeastern part of the country,&#13;
remained cut off for over a month after the hurricane.&#13;
*  Water.  The water supply and sewerage systems, including 9 water works for&#13;
capturing superficial runoff, more than 33 km of water pipes, and 37,200 latrines&#13;
were damaged. About 288,600 houses were affected, and 79 potable water systems&#13;
and 9 sewer systems were damaged.&#13;
*  Energy and Telecommunications. Generation, transmission and distribution systems&#13;
were damaged, including 2 hydroelectric facilities, 10 transmission lines, and 381 km&#13;
of distribution lines. Substantial telecommunications infrastructure was also affected.&#13;
*  Education. Preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Education show that 315&#13;
primary schools were damaged and 255 are being used as temporary shelters. There&#13;
was also damage to school materials and books.&#13;
*  Health. Seven health centers and 250 health posts suffered major damage, with most&#13;
of the damage to facilities and equipment. Unsanitary conditions and the lack of safe&#13;
water are placing many people at risk of transmitted diseases such as dengue and&#13;
cholera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
*  Housing.  ECLAC estimates that about 369,000 people lost their homes, between&#13;
32,000 and 50,000 houses were destroyed, 112,600 were damaged, and 94,500&#13;
suffered minor damage.&#13;
*  Agriculture. The hurricane affected some of the most fertile areas of Nicaragua. A&#13;
large proportion of basic grains production was lost, severely impacting poor, small-&#13;
scale farmers. Other products also suffered extensive damage or their access to&#13;
markets was affected, including bananas, coffee, corn, sorghum, beans and shrimp.&#13;
*  Environment. Direct impacts on the environment from the storm include the loss of&#13;
fertile soil, mainly around watersheds, due to erosion, landslides and flooding around&#13;
river beds. Water was also contaminated due to toxins and agro-chemicals, overflows&#13;
of sewers and latrines, and decomposition of dead animals. The coastal zones have&#13;
been affected by flows from contaminated rivers, and there has been damage to stands&#13;
of trees and losses in reforested areas resulting in loss of habitat and biodiversity.&#13;
6.     Preliminary Estimates of Damage and Replacement Costs.  A preliminary&#13;
estimate prepared by UNDP and ECLAC (Table 1) suggests total direct and indirect&#13;
damage of $900 million (equivalent to 45 percent of Nicaragua's 1997 GDP). The costs&#13;
of replacing the damage to infrastructure and the productive sectors would amount to&#13;
$1.2 billion.&#13;

C.    Response to the Hurricane&#13;
7.     In responding to the hurricane emergency, the Government created a National&#13;
Emergency Committee (NEC) to coordinate relief efforts and assess damages,&#13;
particularly in terms of rescue efforts and emergency assistance to areas affected by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
mudslides and other isolated communities. Customs warehouses in Managua were used&#13;
to store incoming relief supplies and the private sector lent refrigerated facilities to store&#13;
perishables. NEC and Government teams worked with the UN system, the Red Cross&#13;
and emergency response teams from IDA and other donors to determine priorities,&#13;
channel immediate support and coordinate international assistance. The Government also&#13;
put in place mechanisms to provide food and emergency health care to thousands of&#13;
people in approximately 200 shelters, much of this with help from relief agencies, other&#13;
governments, and the private sector. In terms of transport infrastructure, the Pan-&#13;
American Highway and other key routes were reopened within a week using temporary&#13;
solutions (such as Bailey bridges). The Government is implementing a vaccination&#13;
carnpaign and working with the Pan-American Health Organization to rehabilitate basic&#13;
health services and implement a vector control program. As emergency needs subsided,&#13;
NEC was disbanded and the Governrnent set up six Sector Reconstruction Commissions&#13;
(Social, Cooperation and Finance, Infrastructure, Production and Services, Environment,&#13;
and Civil Society) to coordinate the longer-term reconstruction effort. The Commissions&#13;
are chaired by Government representatives, and also include representatives of political&#13;
parties and community members.&#13;
8.    The international community responded swiftly to the disaster.  The initial&#13;
response, especially relying on the UN system and the emergency response capability of&#13;
a number of countries, focused on rescuing communities, re-establishing communications&#13;
and transport links, distributing emergency food and medicines to affected communities,&#13;
and organizing shelters for displaced populations. IDA staff on the ground in Nicaragua&#13;
moved quickly to help the Government coordinate with other donors and conduct a&#13;
preliminary damage assessment. IDA also reallocated funds and restructured existing&#13;
operations, and quickly disbursed the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment&#13;
Credit ($15 million), which provided balance of payments support.&#13;
II. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HURRICANE MITCH&#13;
A.   Macroeconomic Framework Prior to the Hurricane&#13;
9.    Following a period of stagnation in the early 1990s, Nicaragua's economy had&#13;
been growing at a steady pace since 1994 and was heading toward a GDP growth rate of&#13;
around 6 percent in 1998 (Table 2). Unemployment had declined from over 20 percent in&#13;
1994 to less than 14 percent in 1997, while the annual inflation rate remained steady in&#13;
the neighborhood of 10 percent since 1994.  These positive developments were&#13;
underpinned by an ESAF agreement reached with the IMF in March 1998. The&#13;
macroeconomic mainstay of the ESAF arrangement was the fiscal adjustment program,&#13;
designed to reduce the overall public sector deficit (before grants) from almost 16 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1996 to 4 percent in 2000. The reduction in the fiscal deficit, in turn, was to&#13;
permit a rise in public savings from less than 2 percent of GDP in 1996 to 8 percent in&#13;
2000, thereby rendering the country's future growth less dependent of foreign savings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
10.   The ESAF arrangement is a key element of the HIPC process, for which&#13;
Nicaragua is eligible on the grounds of its low income level and extremely high external&#13;
debt burden. Until October 1998, the macroeconomic and structural reform program had&#13;
been on track, so that the decision point under the HIPC was tentatively envisioned for&#13;
late 1999. Following the passage of major fiscal reforms, the public sector deficit was&#13;
reduced to less than 10 percent of GDP in 1997 and was projected to drop to under 6&#13;
percent in 1998. Also, the current account deficit declined from 53 percent of GDP in&#13;
1994 to 32 percent in 1997, mainly due to the rapid expansion of non-traditional exports,&#13;
which grew at annual rates averaging 20 percent in both dollar and volume terms over the&#13;
last three years.&#13;
11.   Nicaragua's rapid economic recovery was accompanied by a resurgence of private&#13;
sector confidence, reflected in a more than doubling of private investment, from 7 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1994 to an estimated 17.5 percent in 1997. The rapid increase in private&#13;
investment levels, in turn, was accompanied by a modest decline in public investment,&#13;
reflecting the Government's commitment to private sector-led growth. Over the last six&#13;
years, Nicaragua had made significant progress in transforming itself from a centralized,&#13;
publicly managed to a private sector-owned economy through the divestiture of around&#13;
350 state-owned enterprises since 1991 and the closure of the largest state bank&#13;
(BANADES) in early 1998. Preparations are also well underway to privatize the second&#13;
largest public bank (BANIC), with IFC support, by early 1999 and the state&#13;
telecommunications company (ENITEL), by April 1999. Other reforms supported by&#13;
IDA include measures to strengthen the regulation and prudential supervision of the&#13;
financial system, improve the legal framework for private investment, downsize and&#13;
streamline the public sector while building up institutional capacity, and improve the&#13;
state's capacity to deliver social services.&#13;

B.    Economic Impact&#13;
12.   The assessment of damage to the economy are still being refined. Since the&#13;
damage occurred fairly late in the year, only part will be reflected in the macroeconomic&#13;
indicators for 1998, and much will be shifted to 1999. These will be some slowdown of&#13;
economic growth due to the loss of crops and indirect damages in the form of reduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
economic activity resulting from production bottlenecks arising from the damages to&#13;
infrastructure and other capital goods losses. These negative indirect effects are expected&#13;
to carry through into 1999, and will be partially offset by intensified reconstruction&#13;
activities, financed through additional foreign inflows from official and private sources.&#13;
The loss of domestic goods not easily replaced by imports also is expected to place&#13;
upward pressure on prices, so that inflation is expected to rise to 17 percent in 1998,&#13;
falling to 15 percent in 1999, compared with about 9 percent a year envisaged before the&#13;
hurricane.&#13;
13.   Preliminary 1998 estimates suggest that the hurricane would result in realtively&#13;
minor fiscal slippages compared to pre-hurricane projections. The 1998 combined public&#13;
sector savings would be about one percentage point, of GDP lower after the hurricane,&#13;
while the combined public sector balance (before grants) would increase by 1.5&#13;
percentage points of GDP to 6.7 percent in 1998. For 1999, the pre-hurricane scenario&#13;
had envisaged that the overall deficit would narrow to 6.1 percent of GDP. However, the&#13;
Government is discussing with the Fund, possible adjustments to the fiscal program&#13;
because of the needs associated with the reconstruction effort and additional social&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
14.   Permanent damage to the main export crop, coffee, was relatively light (less than&#13;
10 percent of production area was affected), but more extensive for bananas and sugar.&#13;
The heaviest damage occurred in the basic grains sector, which threatens to lead to food&#13;
shortages in isolated areas, and particularly affects small, subsistence farrners. There will&#13;
also be higher import levels associated with disaster relief, food imports and&#13;
reconstruction needs. As a result, preliminary estimates indicate that the current account&#13;
deficit could widen by about $60 million in 1998 (about 3 percent of GDP) and about&#13;
$200 million in 1999, compared with pre-hurricane projections. The current account&#13;
deficit would widen to 31.2 percent of GDP in 1998 (compared to 28.3 percent estimated&#13;
prior to Mitch) and 31.9 percent of GDP in 1999 (compared to 24.0 estimated prior to&#13;
Mitch). Rough estimates indicate a financing gap of about $150 million in 1999 (about 6&#13;
percent of GDP). The Government expects to fill the 1999 financing gap through the&#13;
reprogramming of credits (mainly from IDA and IDB), disbursements of new grants and&#13;
credits, emergency balance of payments support from IDA, a proposed augmentation in&#13;
the ESAF, and further debt relief, including disbursements under the recently-established&#13;
CAETF. reconstruction expenditures, and lower tax revenues in the wake of reduced&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
C. Government Measures&#13;
15.   The Government is taking steps to limit the macroeconomic effects of the&#13;
disaster, and set the stage for economic recovery. The Government has reiterated its&#13;
commitment to the policies and objectives of the economic program supported by the&#13;
current ESAF arrangement. Within this framework, the authorities are intensifying their&#13;
efforts to help finance part of the additional reconstruction and social programs through&#13;
expenditure and revenue measures. On the revenue side, the Government recently&#13;
submitted to the Assembly a reform to the tax system raising excises on cigarettes, liquor,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
and soft drinks, and is continuing efforts to improve tax administration.  On the&#13;
expenditure side, the Government plans to pursue efforts aimed at shifting resources from&#13;
lower priority areas to the reconstruction effort. In the structural reform area, the focus&#13;
will be on privatization, strengthening of the financial system, reform of the social&#13;
security system, and the strengthening of governance.&#13;
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.   IDA Strategy&#13;
16.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is consistent with the goal of&#13;
maintaining macroeconomic stability in the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for Nicaragua. The proposed Project is a key element of the three-part strategy to&#13;
assist Nicaragua respond to this natural disaster. The three-part strategy involves:&#13;
Emergency Financing, Macroeconom;- Assistance and Debt Relief.   The&#13;
Government has an urgent need for emergency financing to cover additional import&#13;
needs generated by the emergency, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The&#13;
proposed fast-track Hurricane Emergency Project (HEP) would help to meet this&#13;
immediate need. It complements actions by IDA in the two weeks following the&#13;
hurricane to release the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (all&#13;
conditions were met satisfactorily), which provided balance of payments support at a&#13;
critical juncture.  IDA staff have also been collaborating with the IMF on a&#13;
preliminary reassessment of Nicaragua" macroeconomic situation. Finally, at the&#13;
request of several governments, IDA has established a Central America Emergency&#13;
Trust Fund (CAETF) to which donor contributions are being channeled to support&#13;
hurricane-affected countries in Central America cover multilateral debt service&#13;
payments. As soon as conditions permit, IDA and the IMF, in consultation with the&#13;
IDB, will carry out a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis, as an input to&#13;
determining the appropriate timing for Niearagua's decision point under the HIPC.&#13;
* Short- to Medium-Term Rehabilitation. IDA staff are working with counterpart&#13;
Government agencies and other development partners to reprogram IDA operations&#13;
and/or process supplemental financing to provide for urgent rehabilitation of damaged&#13;
social and economic infrastructure. In view of the extent of the damage and the need&#13;
for quick support, IDA staff believe that reprogramming of the existing portfolio-as&#13;
opposed to designing a new, multi-sector hurricane rehabilitation project-is the&#13;
fastest and most flexible way to meet Nicaragua's short and medium-term&#13;
rehabilitation needs, given that speed is of the essence. Based on preliminary damage&#13;
estimates, we anticipate that 7 of the 10 ongoing IDA operations would be&#13;
restructured within existing credit amounts to finance about $70 million of&#13;
rehabilitation-related expenditures.  In addition, supplemental funding will be&#13;
proposed for an ongoing education project, in the amount of $13 million, and&#13;
supplemental financing of about $15 million for transport is under consideration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Longer-Term  Reconstruction.   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Nicaragua was discussed by the Board on April 9, 1998.  The emergency&#13;
Consultative Group for the countries affected by the hurricane in Central America on&#13;
December 10-1 1 discussed preliminary indications of needs for new assistance. Over&#13;
the next few months, the Government will be preparing a more detailed&#13;
reconstruction program, to be presented at a following Consultative Meeting in&#13;
Stockholm in the Spring. IDA will review its existing CAS in light of the&#13;
reconstruction program. We do not expect that this will require a major reformulation&#13;
of the CAS or its key priorities. If this is not the case, we would present a CAS&#13;
update to the Board in mid-1999. In addition, IDA is already exploring with the&#13;
Government and other donors ways to strengthen Nicaragua's institutional capacity&#13;
for disaster preparedness and management. As soon as conditions permit, we expect&#13;
to initiate preparation of either a freestanding technical assistance operation, or add a&#13;
component to an existing or future operation. This is consistent with the strong&#13;
emphasis already in the CAS on institutional development. In addition, we have been&#13;
exploring with the Government ways in which the National Integrity System&#13;
launched early this year with EDI support, can be adapted to support efforts by the&#13;
Government and civil society to ensure that rehabilitation and longer-term&#13;
reconstruction programs are appropriately and transparently handled.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
17.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is part of the first phase of IDA's&#13;
strategy to assist in the reconstruction of Nicaragua (para. 16). It would assist the&#13;
Government in implementing its program to maintain macroeconomic stability while&#13;
helping to finance import costs associated with rebuilding social and economic&#13;
infrastructure, and re-establishing production levels, in response to the damage caused by&#13;
Hurricane Mitch. The performance of the project would be measured by how well&#13;
Nicaragua maintains macroeconomic stability in 1999 and beyond, especially in terms of&#13;
the current account deficit, and the budget deficit (Attachment 2).&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
18.   The Hurricane Emergency Project will provide immediate, quick-disbursing&#13;
support to finance a positive list of imports needed for the rehabilitation program&#13;
supporting macroeconomic objectives. While the proposed credit would be entirely&#13;
quick-disbursing, it is only one part of an unbundled set of actions by the Bank Group to&#13;
respond to the effects of the hurricane. The project will, inter alia, provide assistance for&#13;
imports of: (i) construction materials and equipment, water, land and air transport&#13;
vehicles, petroleum, and fuel products that are needed for rehabilitation of physical&#13;
infrastructure; (ii) seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment, materials, machinery and fuel&#13;
needed to reestablish agricultural production; (iii) medical supplies and equipment&#13;
needed to replenish stockpile of hospitals, health centers, health posts and outreach&#13;
programs; (iv) school supplies and equipment for educational facilities that were&#13;
damaged or destroyed; and (v) machinery, spare parts and equipment for commercial and&#13;
industrial companies. No disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury goods or&#13;
military equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
19.   The size of the proposed credit at SDR 36.1 million ($50.0 million equivalent) is&#13;
based on the Government's request for emergency assistance and an assessment of the&#13;
adverse effects of Hurricane Mitch on the balance of payments after taking account of the&#13;
assistance expected from the IMF, IDB, and other donors.&#13;
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS/PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   Project Organization and Management&#13;
20.   Project implementation arrangements have been streamlined to conform to the&#13;
emergency nature of IDA's assistance. In addressing IDA's fiduciary responsibilities,&#13;
IDA has sought to ensure that: credit proceeds are administered prudently, and only used&#13;
to finance imports of items included on the positive list; required procurement,&#13;
accounting and auditing procedures are followed; and, appropriate retention of&#13;
documents is provided to allow for IDA supervision and independent audits.&#13;
21.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit&#13;
with the assistance of the Central Bank of Nicaragua.  The execution of an&#13;
Implementation Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, defining the assistance to be provided&#13;
by the Central Bank of Nicaragua is a condition of effectiveness. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Public Credit will provide the basic information on imports (based on&#13;
Customs Declarations) and the General Directorate of Customs will maintain the&#13;
respective supporting documentation.  The credit will finance 100 percent of the&#13;
delivered cost of eligible imports, excluding import duties and taxes, of a positive list&#13;
agreed with Government (Attachment 1).&#13;
B.    Procurement&#13;
22.   Credit proceeds would be made available to finance public and private sector&#13;
imports against documentation evidencing that the imported goods were both on the&#13;
positive list and procured following agreed procurement procedures. Imports financed&#13;
with credit proceeds would be limited to goods from eligible countries as per the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits, dated January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and September 1997).&#13;
No more than 50 percent of the credit would be used to finance the import of any&#13;
category of eligible imports on the positive list.&#13;
22.   The credit would be used to finance only imports procured in accordance with the&#13;
procedures presented in Table 3 below. All procurement of imports by the private sector&#13;
of $3 million or above will be based on Simplified International Competitive Bidding&#13;
Procedures subject to prior review by IDA. Imports by the private sector less than the&#13;
equivalent of $3 million will be acquired based on established commercial practices and&#13;
will not need the prior review of IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
23.   Public sector imports financed under this project would follow Simplified&#13;
International Competitive Bidding procedures, as provided under IDA's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (Clauses 2.63 and 2.64). Contracts let by the public sector of $1 million or&#13;
above and contracts awarded after June 30, 1999 will be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
However, to facilitate the speedy import of items required immediately for the recovery&#13;
effort, public sector imports of less than $1 million equivalent and awarded between&#13;
October 25, 1998 and June 30, 1999 may be made based on international shopping&#13;
procedures as per IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses 3.5 and 3.6). The Project&#13;
would finance the import of fuel and fertilizers by both private and public importers&#13;
through established international commodity markets, or through simplified procurement&#13;
procedures provided for under the IDA's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

C.   Disbursements&#13;
24.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the&#13;
delivered cost of imports, excluding imports duties and taxes, of the agreed positive list.&#13;
In order to avoid excessive transaction costs for IDA, public and private sector import&#13;
contracts of less than $20,000 would not be eligible for financing with credit proceeds.&#13;
With the exception of disbursement for goods procured by the public sector estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more, or after June 30, 1999, or of goods procured&#13;
by the private sector and estimated to cost $3.0 million equivalent or more, all&#13;
disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures for which supporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
documentation would be retained by the General Directorate of Customs and made&#13;
available for review by IDA financial management and procurement specialists and&#13;
project auditors. The project would be implemented over a one-year period and is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 31, 1999. The Closing Date for this credit would&#13;
be June 30, 2000.&#13;
25.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 7.22&#13;
million, 20 percent of credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred&#13;
before credit signing but after October 25, 1998, the approximate date of onset of&#13;
devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.&#13;
26.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar&#13;
Special Account to be established in the Central Bank of Nicaragua, with an initial&#13;
authorized allocation of $12.5 million, 25 percent of the total Credit amount. The Special&#13;
Account would be replenished as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of&#13;
funds to cover eligible imports.&#13;
D.   Financial Management and Monitoring&#13;
27.   The Central Bank of Nicaragua has in place an appropriate mechanism to monitor&#13;
and report on the financial transactions pertaining to this operation. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Public Credit would provide at all times adequate staff for managing the&#13;
Project and maintaining proper accounts and records. The quarterly financial reports will&#13;
reflect the total transfers of resources of the credit and show the total of eligible financed&#13;
imports based on the agreed positive list (corresponding to the lists of imports provided&#13;
by the General Directorate of Customs).&#13;
28.   Quarterly progress reports of monitoring indicators, the project's financial&#13;
transactions, and quarterly audits of project accounts, the Special Account and Statements&#13;
of Expenditures by an independent private accounting firm acceptable to IDA, will be&#13;
provided by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit within 30 days of the end of each&#13;
calendar quarter. The fourth quarter audit report will present the cumulative balances to&#13;
the end of the year. The retaining of an auditing firm acceptable to IDA is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
29.   The Project's monitoring indicators are described in Attachment 2. Reports on&#13;
the progress against these macroeconomic indicators will be prepared and sent to IDA&#13;
quarterly.&#13;

Monitoring Indicators&#13;
The objectives of the Hurricane Emergency Project is to assist the Republic of Nicaragua&#13;
to finance critical imports needed for the rehabilitation and rebuilding effort, while maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability. The following indicators would be used to monitor progress toward&#13;
achieving the Project's objective:&#13;
* The balance of payments current account deficit expected not to exceed 32.0 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1999.&#13;
* The combined public sector overall deficit expected not to exceed 11.0 percent of GDP in&#13;
1999.&#13;
Progress toward meeting these targets will be monitored quarterly and the indicators will&#13;
be adjusted, by agreement between the Borrower and IDA, as macroeconomic estimates and&#13;
projections are refined, in line with the Government's economic program and the Policy&#13;
Framework Paper.&#13;

            Nicaragua - Hurricane Emergency Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Hurricane Emergency Project assists
            Nicaragua in maintaining macroeconomic stability by
            financing imports associated with rebuilding social and
            economic infrastructure and by re-establishing production
            levels. It is an integral part of a broader set of the
            International Development Association's (IDA) efforts
            to help Nicaragua respond to the effects of Hurricane Mitch.
            The project provides immediate, quick-disbursing credit to
            support the purchase of 1) construction materials and
            equipment as well as water, land and air transport vehicles,
            petroleum, and fuel products needed for rehabilitating
            physical infrastructure; 2) seeds, fertilizers, and
            agricultural equipment along with materials, machinery, and
            fuel needed to reestablish agricultural production; 3)
            medical supplies and equipment needed to replenish
            stockpiles in hospitals, health centers, health posts, and
            outreach programs; 4) school supplies and equipment for
            educational facilities that were damaged or destroyed; and
            5) machinery, spare parts, and equipment for commercial and
            industrial companies.
