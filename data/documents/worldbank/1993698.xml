The Government of India has renewed&#13;
the Strategic Alliance with the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program-South Asia for a period of&#13;
three years to provide support to the Sector&#13;
Reforms Projects. An important activity of this&#13;
partnership relates to the organization of a&#13;
series of Jal Manthan workshops for spreading&#13;
the philosophy and principles of community&#13;
participatory and demand-responsive&#13;
strategies in these Sector Reforms Projects to&#13;
every nook and cranny of the country.&#13;

            Launching sector reforms : supporting the
            Government of India pilot demand-responsive approaches to
            rural water supply and sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Government of India has embarked on
            a program of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation 'sector
            reforms', to shift to more demand-responsive and
            participatory approaches by empowering local governments and
            community groups to fully manage their own services. The
            program is to be implemented in a phased manner and
            implementation will take place in batches. The primary
            actors will include the district institution, local users
            committees, and nongovernmental organizations. If
            successful, the sector reform pilots could lead the way for
            all rural areas in India in demand-responsive delivery of
            water supply and sanitation. The potential for strengthening
            local government and thereby opening the door for more
            effective delivery of other services is also vast. Although
            fully funded by the government, a role does exist for donors
            to support the process and assist in capacity-building.
