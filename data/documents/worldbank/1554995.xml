TRADE ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND&#13;
INCOME DISTRIBUTION IN THREE&#13;
ARCHETYPE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES&#13;
This paper explores quantitatively the macroeconomic and distribu-&#13;
tional impacts on non-oil producing, semi-industrial developing countries of&#13;
external shocks originating in the world economy -- in particular, rising&#13;
costs of imports and shrinking export markets. The empirical effects of the&#13;
same external shock are modelled for three different archetype economies:&#13;
a primary exporter, a manufacturing exporter, and a closed economy. Three&#13;
different policy-adjustment regimes are considered: devaluation, premium&#13;
rationing of imports (import licenses), and premium rationing in an environment&#13;
with a fixed real wage for unskilled labor. The results show that differences&#13;
in resource endowments and initial conditions strongly affect the impact of a&#13;
given adjustment policy on both the economic structure and the distribution of&#13;
income.&#13;
By making simple assumptions about the way socioeconomic groups&#13;
operate in the political process, the paper also examines how the struggle&#13;
between the gainers and losers is likely to affect the policy regime to be&#13;
chosen. An index of "political feasibility" is defined using -a variety of&#13;
weighting schemes reflecting different views of the relative political power&#13;
of different socioeconomic groups. The analysis provides a useful starting&#13;
point for analyzing the political, as well as economic, implications of&#13;
different economic policies.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
Changes in the international economy in the decade of the 1970's&#13;
have resulted in great structural changes in developing and developed eco-&#13;
nomies. In the two decades before 1973, world trade grew at an unprecedented&#13;
rate of 8 percent a year. Since 1973, the rate of growth has halved. 1/ The&#13;
reasons for this decline are clearly linked to the shocks that have occurred&#13;
in the world economy since 1973, including the recession in the developed&#13;
countries. These events, and the specter of growing restrictionist policies&#13;
in the developed countries, have compounded the uncertainty about the future&#13;
so that many developing countries have cut back investment in exporting&#13;
industries and their governments have shown an increasing unwillingness to&#13;
pursue outward-looking policies. If the trend growth in world trade is not&#13;
resumed, either through increased demand by the developed countries or through&#13;
increased trade among developing countries, then the role of international&#13;
trade as an engine of growth will be seriously impaired.&#13;
In addition to the relative decline in export markets, oil-importing&#13;
countries have been seriously affected by the increase in energy prices.&#13;
There has also been a general increase in the relative prices to developing&#13;
countries of other essential inputs such as capital goods as a result of&#13;
the general inflation experienced by developed countries. The shock of&#13;
increased prices of crucial inputs for which substitutes are not really&#13;
possible in the medium term has been especially severe for the developing&#13;
countries. The continuation into the future of these effects, on both&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the export and import sides, will face developing countries with the need&#13;
for further structural adjustments in their economies of the kind they&#13;
have experienced since 1973.&#13;
The nature of the structural adjustment required to restore external&#13;
and internal equilibrium after a shock involves significant changes in rela-&#13;
tive prices and incomes within the country. The first, and by no means least&#13;
painful, adjustment requires that aggregate expenditure be cut to reflect the&#13;
fall in the foreign terms of trade. Second, restoring equilibrium calls for a&#13;
reallocation of resources from the more exportable sectors towards the sectors&#13;
in which there is scope for import substitution. Finally, the real exchange&#13;
rate has to adjust to attain external and internal balance by means of a shift&#13;
of resources between sectors producing home goods and sectors producing&#13;
tradables. In market economies, these resource shifts are achieved through&#13;
changes in relative prices via the working of product and factor markets. In&#13;
turn, the changes in product prices, wages and profits alter the distribution&#13;
of income among socioeconomic groups. Finally, these distributional shifts&#13;
take place in an environment where different socioeconomic groups attempt to&#13;
maintain or improve their relative position in society thereby affecting the&#13;
choice of government policy.&#13;
This paper is inspired by the nature of the external shocks that&#13;
have hit developing countries after 1973 and by our perception that required&#13;
structural adjustments involve significant distributional shifts that have&#13;
an important impact on the choice of trade adjustment policies. Our intent&#13;
is to explore quantitatively the links between adjustment policies, economic&#13;
structure and the distribution of income. The analysis is carried out with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which provides a useful framework&#13;
to analyze how the workings of the market mechanism, in conjunction with&#13;
public policy, determine the returns to factors of production and the pur-&#13;
chasing power of income. 1/ Rather than basing the study on the historical,&#13;
political, and economic circumstances in a particular country, we have sought&#13;
to investigate how a common external shock and trade policy response might&#13;
have different effects in different environments. We create three representa-&#13;
tive, or archetype, economies and subject them to the same set of policy&#13;
reactions to an identical external shock. To keep the analysis and interpre-&#13;
tation of results manageable, we emphasize distinguishing characteristics of&#13;
our archetype economies and make them quite similar in other non-essential&#13;
aspects. How the data sets are constructed is described in Appendix A.&#13;
The approach followed here has some important implications for the&#13;
analysis of development policy. First, it provides limited, but systematic,&#13;
evidence of the extent to which differences in resource endowments and initial&#13;
conditions reflected in differing economic structures affect the impact of a&#13;
given economic policy. For instance, is an adverse movement in foreign terms&#13;
of trade likely to affect more adversely a closed or an open economy and, if&#13;
the economy is open, will it require a greater adjustment if it is a manufac-&#13;
turing exporter or if it is a primary exporter? One can also investigate&#13;
whether, in different economic environments, similar or different policies are&#13;
preferable from the point of view of their impact on the distribution of&#13;
income.&#13;
1/   The equations describing the model are given in Appendix B.     For a&#13;
further description of CGE models see Dervis, de Melo and Robinson (1981)&#13;
and for an application to income distribution see Adelman and Robinson&#13;
(1978) or de Melo and Robinson (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A second interesting set of questions relates to political-economy&#13;
issues. By investigating the effects of policies on the distribution of&#13;
income across a typology of countries, one can draw inferences about the&#13;
likely course of action policy makers will take on the basis of pressures&#13;
from the most influential groups in society. In a primary exporting economy,&#13;
for example, how the income of large landowners is affected may be more&#13;
important than in an economy that exports manufactures, in which the impact on&#13;
industrialists may well determine the political feasibility of a particular&#13;
policy choice.&#13;
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next&#13;
section considers recent external shocks which have had, and will continue&#13;
to have, an important impact on the growth prospects of developing coun-&#13;
tries. The need to adjust to these shocks and the difficulty of accomplishing&#13;
the adjustment due to structural rigidities are also discussed. Section III&#13;
describes the archetype economies chosen for the analysis, along with the&#13;
selected set of experiments. The following two sections describe how alterna-&#13;
tive adjustment mechanisms affect the distribution of income in each economy&#13;
and contrasts the effects of each policy response across the three representa-&#13;
tive economies. Section VI discusses how the political struggle among socio-&#13;
economic groups is likely to influence policy selection. Conclusions follow&#13;
in Section VII.&#13;

II. External Shocks and Macroeconomic Adjustment&#13;
Given the macroeconomic imbalance caused by recent external shocks,&#13;
what determines the extent of disequilibrium and what determines the ease&#13;
with which adjustment takes place? As we shall see below in sections V and&#13;
VI, how adjustment takes place depends, above all, on how the various socio-&#13;
economic groups will react to their perceived change in relative and absolute&#13;
income. In addition, the nature and extent of disequilibrium caused by these&#13;
shocks depends very much on the structure of the economy. Finally, the extent&#13;
to which the decline in absorption can be cushioned by timely external borrow-&#13;
ing and by the use of short term stabilization policies will affect the ease&#13;
with which the transition can be achieved.&#13;
To explore the range of possible adjustments, consider the standard&#13;
model with tradables and home goods. Prior to the shock, the economy satis-&#13;
fies its budget constraint and is in a state of external and internal balance.&#13;
Let the shock consist of a rise in the world price of imports, holding the&#13;
price of home goods constant. The shock reduces income measured in terms of&#13;
tradables, leading to a decline in income as a result of the decline in the&#13;
terms of trade, the size of which depends on the openness of the economy.&#13;
In the very short run, prior to the cut in expenditures and to the&#13;
reallocation of resources, consumers would attempt to move to substitute home&#13;
goods for tradables which would create excess demand for home goods. Even-&#13;
tually, resources would shift towards tradables in response to the rise in&#13;
import prices. However, unless by pure coincidence, the economy would not yet&#13;
have achieved macroeconomic balance as there would still be an excess demand&#13;
for home goods at the unchanged relative price of home goods for tradables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
The difficult task facing policy makers is to achieve a permanent change in&#13;
the real exchange rate so as eventually to reach macroeconomic equilibrium.&#13;
However, this is not an easy task and, if the price adjustment cannot be&#13;
maintained, perhaps because of sticky real wages, the economy may eventually&#13;
be forced to deflate. One could, for instance, imagine that wages rise with&#13;
the price of imports which in turn causes the price of home goods to rise,&#13;
and so on. 1/ The outcome then is permanent structural disequilibrium with&#13;
successive rounds of devaluation accompanied by domestic inflation. Assuming&#13;
that equilibrium is eventually reached, it is clear that both a reduction and&#13;
a switch in expenditures must be achieved if the economy is to avoid unemploy-&#13;
ment of resources. However difficult it may be to carry out expenditure-&#13;
switching policies, the costs of failure can be large in macroeconomic terms.&#13;
This is not to say that the distribution of income, broadly defined,&#13;
is only affected by the structural changes described above. The impact of&#13;
inflation on real wealth is also important and should be kept in mind in&#13;
discussing an adjustment of the magnitude required by the recent events in the&#13;
world economy. However, the recent external shocks suffered by developing&#13;
countries are structural rather than monetary and, in spite of their monetary&#13;
consequences, they call for structural adjustments in the economy. It is the&#13;
distributional consequences of these structural adjustments that we focus on&#13;
in this analysis.&#13;
Consider the following alternative structural adjustments. If&#13;
employed labor is sufficiently well organized, then real wages are sticky,&#13;
thereby reducing the role of expenditure-switching policies so that adjustment&#13;
1/   Findlay (1973), Chapter 12 presents a similar model where home goods&#13;
prices are determined on a mark-up basis and real wages are fixed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
takes place mostly by expenditure reduction.    Alternatively, if it is the&#13;
capitalists' interests that prevail, real wages will fall and the question&#13;
then is which capitalist group has the most political power. In an open&#13;
economy, devaluation would be favored by capitalists who would look forward to&#13;
the prospects of a greater volume of exports and to the possibility of import&#13;
substituting activities.   In a closed economy where import substitution is&#13;
already at an advanced stage, capitalists would attempt to protect their&#13;
present position. A system of import licenses issued directly to producers in&#13;
the case of intermediate goods and perhaps to wholesalers in the service&#13;
sector for consumer goods would be a likely policy outcome.&#13;
Of course, these are extreme alternatives and there are other impor-&#13;
tant considerations that will have an impact on the distribution of income.&#13;
Clearly the poor will suffer greatly from devaluation, and even more so&#13;
from a system of import licenses, in an economy which is a food importer&#13;
(for example, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Chile). For different reasons, devalua-&#13;
tion will benefit landowners in a primary exporting economy.      It is therefore&#13;
important in an analysis of the impact of adjustment policies on the distribu-&#13;
tion of income to capture differences in the structure of production and trade&#13;
and differences in the volume of trade as well as differences in the composi-&#13;
tion of consumption expenditures among socioeconomic groups.&#13;

III. The Three Archetype Economies&#13;
As discussed by Chenery (1979), the pattern of growth across&#13;
countries varies greatly.   An important source of the variation is the de-&#13;
gree of openness of the economy which is itself influenced by country size,&#13;
factor endowments and past government policies. In their work analyzing the&#13;
pattern of development across a large number of developing countries, Chenery&#13;
and Syrquin constructed a typology of developing countries based on trade&#13;
orientation and related to policy choLces of a country as well as on its&#13;
natural endowments. Much of our inspiration in the construction of the three&#13;
archetype economies described here comes from their work and more recent work&#13;
based on comparative input-output data for a number of countries. 1/&#13;
The three economies are all assumed to be "semi-industrial" countries&#13;
with an income per capita around $500 (1970 US$). Such-countries are in a&#13;
transitional phase with their economic structure closer to that of the indus-&#13;
trialized countries than to the very poor low income countries in which the&#13;
overwhelming bulk of economic activity is in the primary sector. Thus,&#13;
although the different patterns of international trade in the three countries&#13;
result in considerable variation in economic structure, they all generate well&#13;
over 20 percent of GDP in the manufacturing sector.&#13;
While they have quite different structures of trade, production and&#13;
employment, we have also assumed them to be similar in a number of important&#13;
respects. First, they are identical in size with the same total physical&#13;
output and size of the labor force. This simplification is particularly&#13;
1/   See Chener- and Syrquin (1975), Chenery (1979), Chapters 1 to 3, and&#13;
Kubo and Robinson (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
useful when comparing the number of people in poverty and various other&#13;
macroeconomic changes. Second, they share virtually the same technology. 1/&#13;
This assumption is common in cross-country comparisons where universal access&#13;
to a common technology is often assumed. The input-output coefficients differ&#13;
very little across the three countries, the capital structure (B) matrices&#13;
are identical and capital/output ratios are the same. We do assume different&#13;
labor endowments by skill categories which implies that labor/output and hence&#13;
capital/labor ratios udffer.&#13;
The final area in which we have imposed uniformity across the&#13;
archetypes relates to the choice of parameters describing consumer and&#13;
producer response to relative price changes. Trade elasticities, elas-&#13;
ticities of substitution in production, and income and price elasticities&#13;
of demand for consumption by socioeconomic groups are the same. Each socio-&#13;
economic group makes expenditure decisions according to the Linear Expenditure&#13;
System (LES). The parameters of the LES vary across socioeconomic groups,&#13;
but are the same for a given type of group across countries. 2/ To simplify&#13;
further, production functions are assumed to be Cobb-Douglas in capital and&#13;
labor, with fixed input-output coefficients for intermediate inputs. Finally,&#13;
the logvariances describing the distribution of income within socioeconomic&#13;
groups are the same for a given socioeconomic group in all three archetype&#13;
economies.&#13;
The model has eight sectors. The primary (1) sector includes&#13;
agricultural and mining while the food (2) sector includes processing and&#13;
manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco. Consumer Goods (3) might&#13;

also be called "light" industry and does involve some vertical aggrega-&#13;
tions; for example, textiles and clothing, wood and wood products. Interme-&#13;
diates (4) and capital goods (5) are demanded only by producers while con-&#13;
struction (6) is a pure investment good. Social overhead (7) includes&#13;
utilities, transportation and housing. Services (8) includes retail and&#13;
wholesale trade, government services, banking, insurance, etc. Furthermore,&#13;
we assume that (6) - (8) are pure non-traded sectors and that all government&#13;
non-investment expenditure is concentrated in services.&#13;
It is a difficult matter requiring compromise to come up with&#13;
a satisfactory definition of socioeconomic groups which is useful both&#13;
for economic and political analysis and is also closely related to the&#13;
variables generated endogenously by a CGE model. The socioeconomic classi-&#13;
fication described below represents one such compromise. Table 1 summarizes&#13;
the socioeconomic classification of households, the sectors from which their&#13;
income is derived and whether that income is wage or profit income. Finally,&#13;
it provides the assumed within-group logvariance of the distribution of&#13;
income within each socioeconomic group. 1/&#13;
By "farmers" we mean agricultural workers and small landowners&#13;
or "minifundistas" who own a plot of land that provides enough income to&#13;
support a family. What distinguishes them from marginal labor, besides&#13;
their slightly higher income, is that they are tied to the land and earn,&#13;
in addition to their wage income, a share of agricultural profits. Because&#13;
1/   The distribution of income within each socioeconomic group is given&#13;
by a lognormal distribution with an exogenously specified logvariance.&#13;
The overall distribution is derived by numerically aggregating the&#13;
witlhin-group distributions. The technique is described in Adelman&#13;
and Robinson (1978).&#13;

there is considerable variation in the size and quality of land owned by&#13;
smaller farmers, we have assumed this group has a fairly high within-group&#13;
logvariance. By contrast, marginal labor--the only group which is mobile&#13;
across all sectors--is fairly homogeneous. With an income a shade above&#13;
-half of the economy-wide mean income, they are the largest and poorest&#13;
group in society and their income is fairly equally distributed. Industrial&#13;
laborers, or organized labor, are employed in the manufacturing sector.&#13;
The smallest wage-earning group in society, they are fairly disparate in&#13;
composition and include white collar workers, clerical workers, technicians&#13;
and engineers. Their income is about 1.5 times that of marginal labor.&#13;
Service sector laborers include government workers and, finally, we have the&#13;
three capitalist groups who get their income from profits. Their number is&#13;
fixed exogenously with the income of the industrial capitalists about ten&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

times the economy-wide mean income and about 30 percent above that of agri-&#13;
cultural capitalists.   Service sector capitalists include a large group of&#13;
self employed (such as retail traders, etc.) and have an income about five&#13;
times the mean income. 1/&#13;
These groups whose incomes are determined by the model represent&#13;
the minimum necessary to capture the diversity of socioeconomic groups found&#13;
in semi-industrial countries.   Clearly there is considerable range of varia-&#13;
tion in mean inLome and, at this level of aggregation, a considerable degree&#13;
of heterogeneity within socioeconomic groups. The countries are characterized&#13;
by a fairly high degree of inequality, with Gini coefficients of approximately&#13;
0.50 (or overall logvariance of 0.60). 2/   About 45 percent of the overall&#13;
logvariance is due to between-group variation and corresponds to that part of&#13;
total inequality which is endogenous to the model.&#13;
We now come to the distinguishing characteristics built into the&#13;
production side of the three archetype economies. The distinctions introduced&#13;
into the otherwise similar structures fall under three categories. First, the&#13;
economies are distinguished by their volume of trade. Two of the economies are&#13;
open in the sense that the volume of exports as a proportion of GDP is large&#13;
(15 percent). Second, they are distinguished by their structures of production&#13;
and trade. Of the two open economies, one is a primary exporter and the other&#13;
is a manufacturing exporter. Accordingly, the structure of production is&#13;
biased toward the primary sector in the first and towards manufacturing in&#13;
1/   Group and economy-wide mean incomes in the base run are given in&#13;
Table 10 below0&#13;
2/   Gini coefficients of this magnitude are higher than those reported&#13;
for Asian countries where the distribution of land is fairly equal but&#13;
lower than those of most Latin American countries. See Jain (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the second.  The third distinguishing characteristic, which provides the basis&#13;
for the structural differences described above, are variations in factor&#13;
endowments, tariffs and subsidies that are assumed to account for the dif-&#13;
ferences in production and trade structures between the three economies.&#13;
There are thus three archetype economies: primary exporter (PE),&#13;
manufacturing exporter (ME) and closed economy (CL). 1/ They differ in:&#13;
sectoral structure of production, employment and capital; volume of trade;&#13;
sectoral composition of eAports and imports; skill composition of the labor&#13;
force; and past trade policies reflected in different sets of tariffs and&#13;
subsidies. These differences are summarized in Tables 2 to 4.&#13;
Table 2 compares the structure of production and trade in the&#13;
Base Run (prior to any shock) across the three archetypes. All of the&#13;
variation in structure comes from the relative sizes of the industrial&#13;
and primary sectors, and from variations within the manufacturing sector&#13;
itself.&#13;
The PE economy, with a larger primary sector (and hence a smaller&#13;
manufacturing sector), has a distinctively different gross output structure.&#13;
The differences between the CL and ME structures are less pronounced, although&#13;
the ME economy has a much larger consumer goods sector which provides its main&#13;
source of foreign exchange while the CL economy has larger primary and food&#13;
sectors to assure self sufficiency.&#13;
The overall export and import ratios (see also Table 3) indicate the&#13;
sharp difference in volume of trade between the closed and open economies.&#13;
1/   Note that the structure of imports describing the closed economy in&#13;
Table 2 corresponds more closely to that found in countries like&#13;
Mexico and Turkey than to that prevailing in larger countries like&#13;
Brazil or India.&#13;

Note that with world prices exogenous and equal to unity, the foreign capital&#13;
inflow is the same for all three economies and is maintained at its Base Run&#13;
level throughout the experiments. The variation in exports and imports is&#13;
most obvious at the 3-sector level of aggregation. The PE and ME economies&#13;
have opposite structures and the CL economy resembles the PE economy on the&#13;
importing side, while on the export side it has a balanced structure with half&#13;
of its exports originating from the primary sector. Within the manufacturing&#13;
sector, note that the CL economy is almost as dependent on imports of interme-&#13;
diates and capital goods as the other economies. 1/&#13;
TabLe 3 provides information on the sectoral trade orientation&#13;
of the three archetype economies. It is crucial for understanding how&#13;
the common external shock gets transmitted across sectors and across archetypes.&#13;
The most tradable sectors in the sense that the domestic price system is&#13;
closely tied to the exogenous world prices are the sectors which have high&#13;
ratios of imports to domestic supply and/or high ratios of exports to domestic&#13;
production. Note also that although there are three pure non-traded sectors.&#13;
in the economy, these are among the most import-dependent sectors due to the&#13;
high import content of total intermediate inputs.&#13;
1/   Accompanying, and responsible for, this foreign trade structure are&#13;
the following trade incentives: tariffs of 25 percent, 35 percent,&#13;
20 percent for consumer goods, intermediates and capital goods for&#13;
ME and PE; 15 percent across the board export subsidies for PE and&#13;
75 percent export subsidies for manufacturing in ME; no export sub-&#13;
sidies for CL and the following tariffs: consumer goods (75 percent),&#13;
intermediates (75 percent) and capital goods (20 percent). All three&#13;
economies have the following trade substitution elasticities: Primary&#13;
(3.0), Food (1.5), Consumer Goods (1.25), Intermediates (0.75), Capital&#13;
Goods (0.25).&#13;

The final distinction between the three archetypes relates to&#13;
factor e-xdowments which are given in Table 4. All three economies have&#13;
a total labor force of 10 million. As one would expect on the basis of&#13;
the factor endowment theory of international trade, the pattern of trade&#13;
is closely related to each archetype's factor endowments. Thus the PE&#13;
economy has the largest supply of farmers while the ME economy has the&#13;
greatest supply of marginal labor and especially of organized labor which&#13;
are intensively used in the manufacturing sector. As is the case with&#13;
most other indicators, the CL economy, which has the most balanced trade&#13;
and production structure, has a pattern of factor endowments in between&#13;
those of the two open economies.&#13;

IV. The Macroeconomic Impact of an External Shock&#13;
The external shock we impos'e on each of the archetype economies&#13;
has two components. On the import side, the exogenous world prices of&#13;
imports are raised by 25 percent across the board. On the export side,&#13;
physical exports are lowered by 25 percent in all sectors and are essentially&#13;
fixed to their new values. 1/ World prices of exports, however, remain fixed.&#13;
This experiment is intended to capture the essence of the trends evident&#13;
in the second half of the seventies; first, the increase in the purchase&#13;
price of developing countries imports spurred by the rise in energy prices and&#13;
compounded by the inflationary situation that developed in the industrialized&#13;
countries; and second, the world recession that led to restrictionist policies&#13;
in industrialized countries and the relative decline in world trade. We have&#13;
deliberately chosen to ignore any additional terms-of-trade losses that occur&#13;
because developing countries face downward sloping demand curves for their&#13;
exports.&#13;
In selecting the external shock, we have tried to facilitate&#13;
the comparison across archetypes by the following simplifications. First,&#13;
combining equal across-the-board rises in import prices with equal across-&#13;
the-board reductions in export ratios yields an undifferentiated external&#13;
shock for all three economies so that the impact effect depends only on&#13;
the total volume of trade in the economy. Second, by fixing the world&#13;
1/   In the model, it is convenient to cut exports by lowering all the&#13;
sectoral export supply ratios (see Table 3). This, however, does permit&#13;
a slight export supply response through changes in the sectoral com-&#13;
position and level of output. In the experiments, this effect is very&#13;
small.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
price of exports, the decline in the foreign terms of trade is the same&#13;
for all three economies so that the resulting income loss depends on the&#13;
initial volume of trade and not on its composition.&#13;
To study the interactions between adjustment policies and the&#13;
distribution of income, we compare the following three adjustment policies:&#13;
devaluation, premium rationing and premium rationing with a fixed real wage&#13;
for marginal labor. There are Important political as well as economic dif-&#13;
ferences between the three adjustment mechanisms. A policy of devaluation,&#13;
because of its fairly even spread across sectors, could be viewed as a poli-&#13;
tical compromise reflecting some minimal degree of consensus among socio-&#13;
economic groups. A policy of granting Import licenses giving rise to premia&#13;
reflects a situation where political power is concentrated in the hands of&#13;
the capitalists and would accentuate income concentration.     Finally, a&#13;
policy of premia on imports coupled with fixed real wages for marginal labor&#13;
reflects a situation where no socioeconomic group is firmly in control of&#13;
policymaking. Businessmen manage to appropriate the premia associated&#13;
with a system of import control by licensing but, on the other hand, workers&#13;
are sufficiently well organized to prevent a fall in real wages.&#13;
What then is the macroeconomic impact of alternative adjustments to&#13;
the external shock? Table 5 contrasts the magnitudes of changes in the major&#13;
components of GDP at constant prices across the three countries for each of&#13;
the alternative adjustment mechanisms. Consider first the case of devalua-&#13;
tion. At constant prices, the fall in real GDP ranges between 3.7 percent for&#13;
CL to 2.3 percent for PE. At first sight, this result seems counterintuitive&#13;
since the economy which trades the least is the most severely affected.&#13;
The result is due to the different structures of production and trade in the&#13;
&#13;

three economies. The CL economy has the highest ratio of intermediate input&#13;
requirements to total production and, moreover, its imports are concentrated&#13;
in the intermediate sector with a low trade substitution elasticity. After&#13;
the shock, the ratio of the value of intermediate inputs (both domestic and&#13;
imported) to total absorption rises the most in the CL economy (up to 4.9&#13;
percentage points compared to 4.2 and 2.9 for the PE and ME economies). The&#13;
result is that the adjustment is much more painful for CL than for the other&#13;
two economies. The required devaluation in the open economies is around 35&#13;
percent while in the closed economy it is over 60 percent.&#13;
With a real GDP lss of 3.2 percent, the ME economy is harder&#13;
hit than the PE economy. The reason is that PE has a production structure&#13;
biased toward the primary sector which, next to food, is the least import&#13;
dependent sector in the economy. Although the ratio of imported to total&#13;
intermediate inputs is about the same in the PE economy, the ratio of total&#13;
intermediate inputs to total production is lower. The PE economy thus depends&#13;
less on imported goods to maintain production levels.&#13;
It is also interesting to compare how the major final demand aggre-&#13;
gates are affected by the shock. Private consumption falls the least in the&#13;
PE economy which is what one would expect since agricultural and food exports&#13;
are now supplied to the domestic market, dampening the cut in aggregate&#13;
consumption expenditure. With a 7.5 percent decline, the fall in private&#13;
consumption expenditures is highest in the ME economy which has to bear the&#13;
brunt of higher prices for food imports. Government consumption rises by&#13;
approximately 10 percent across all three economies, largely because gov-&#13;
erinent domestic currency revenues from tariffs increase both because they&#13;
are levied on higher foreign prices and because the currency has devalued.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

While, under devaluation, the differences in adjustments between&#13;
countries are not great for exports and imports, they are quite significant&#13;
for investment. In the model, fixed savings rates are assumed for the gov-&#13;
ernment and for each socioeconomic group which implies that the model is&#13;
"ssavings driven." Foreign capital inflows are assumed to be part of savings.&#13;
To understand why real investment falls by more than 16 percent in PE but&#13;
only by 7 percent in ME we need more information about the composition of&#13;
investment and the sources of savings. First, note that one expects to find&#13;
variations in relative prices and hence differences in the prices of capital&#13;
goods.  Even the same nominal investment would, after the shock, yield dif-&#13;
ferent real investment. As can be seen from Table 6, the investment goods&#13;
price deflator varies widely across the three economies, changing least&#13;
for the ME economy (because of the increased availability of capital goods&#13;
on the domestic market).&#13;
There is also a second effect which can be seen by examining the&#13;
composition of savings (in current prices) provided in Table 6. The trade&#13;
deficit, measured in world prices, is identical and remains fixed across the&#13;
three economies and also is assumed to be part of savings. 1/ But this saving&#13;
takes place in domestic prices and hence varies with devaluation. The foreign&#13;
component of domestic savings--22 percent in the base run--rises dramatically&#13;
across all three economies with devaluation. And of course it rises most in CL&#13;
where devaluation is greatest. Thus real investment falls less in CL than&#13;
in PE, even though both economies experience essentially the same rise in&#13;
capital goods prices. 2/&#13;
1/   For further details see Appendix A.&#13;
2/   This effect, often referred to as the Hirschman (1948) effect, has&#13;
been noted and investigated in the context of developing countries&#13;
by, among others, Cooper (1971) and Krugman and Taylor (1978).&#13;

Whether and to what extent foreign capital inflows are channelled&#13;
into investment is an issue which has often been debated in the literature.&#13;
After having been much discussed in the context of two-gap models, the issue&#13;
has resurfaced in the debate on the role of alternative closure rules on the&#13;
distribution of income. 1/ As we have shown elsewhere, how investment is&#13;
determined may have a significant impact on the distribution of income. 2/&#13;
For example, had real investment been fixed, with increases in the prices of&#13;
capital goods from 6 to 19 percent, there would have been significant forced&#13;
savings which might have worsened the distribution of income, depending on the&#13;
nature of the forced-saving mechanism assumed.&#13;
Since exports are essentially fixed, the main difference between&#13;
adjustment by devaluation and adjustment by premium rationing is the income&#13;
transfer to capitalists. Also, devaluation has no inherent efficiency advan-&#13;
tage over a uniform import premium. In other experiments not reported here,&#13;
we allowed an export response to the policy shock by specifying logistic&#13;
export supply functions (see de Melo and Robinson (1980)). When compared with&#13;
adjustment by premium rationing, devaluation is more attractive in the case&#13;
where some export response is allowed than in the version adopted here.&#13;
Many of the differences in the pattern of adjustment between&#13;
the three economies remains when adjustment takes place by premium rationing.&#13;
It is interesting, however, to note that the GDP loss is slightly less than in&#13;
the case of devaluation for two economies, CL and PE. This effect is largely&#13;
1/ See Papanek (1972) and Taylor (1980).&#13;
2/ See Dervis, de Melo and Robinson (1980), chapter 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
due to the distortion-removing effect of adding premia to tariffs.    Thus&#13;
CL and PE, which have the most uneven tariff structures, end up with tariff&#13;
structures that are much more uniform as a result of the imposition of pre-&#13;
mia. 1/ Also note that the pattern of changes in real investment is now&#13;
almost entirely accounted for by the differential impact of the shock on&#13;
capital goods prices.&#13;
Premium payments as a percent of GDP range from 6.6 percent for ME&#13;
to 9.2 percent for CL. The potential rents accruing to the private sector&#13;
from a system of licenses can therefore be enormous and it is no surprise that&#13;
it is important what method of adjustment is used. Although more sensitivity&#13;
analysis would be needed before one could establish a correspondence between&#13;
devaluation and associated premia, these results are consistent with the&#13;
often-made observation that huge rents are commonplace in economies which&#13;
choose to maintain external balance with a system of import controls. 2/&#13;
Finally, we come to adjustment by premia combined with fixed&#13;
real wages. The fall in GDP due to the contractionary impact of the external&#13;
shock is,exacerbated by induced unemployment ranging from 1.6 percent for PE to&#13;
7.1 percent for ME. As a result, GDP falls substantially more, except in the&#13;
primary exporter. The PE economy is least affected for two reasons. First,&#13;
the cost of living rises less in the economies which export rather than import&#13;
1/   See Johnson (1960) for an analysis of the welfare effects of tariffs&#13;
which takes into account the variance of tariffs across sectors.&#13;
2/   Note that the premium rate is higher than the devaluation rate even&#13;
though the composition and volume of imports and exports are similar.&#13;
This is entirely because of the normalization rule which maintains&#13;
a weighted sum of composite prices constant. Thus the domestic cur-&#13;
rency price of exports does not rise in the case of premia rationing&#13;
whereas it does in the case of devaluation. It follows that to maintain&#13;
the same price level, the domestic prices of imports do not rise as&#13;
much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

food. This effect is important since the weight of food in the consumer&#13;
basket of marginal labor is about 60 percent. Second, the PE economy has the&#13;
smallest supply of marginal labor (see Table 4) so that, other things equal,&#13;
aggregate employment will not fall as much.&#13;
It is important to note that if we had instead made the short&#13;
run assumption that nominal rather than real wages remain fixed, the impact&#13;
of adjustment on the distribution of income would have been quite different.&#13;
Indeed, with real wages falling, the demand for labor would have increased.&#13;
Such an assumption is not justified in a medium-term model and, in any case,&#13;
would require an analysis of inflationary mechanisms which is beyond the&#13;
scope of the present analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
V. Policy Choice and the Distribution of Income&#13;
The impact of the external shock results in a decline in real&#13;
income and the extent of that decline depends on the choice of adjustment&#13;
policy. In addition, the composition of imports determines to a large&#13;
extent whether the burden of adjustment falls on consumption or on investment.&#13;
Thus for the ME economy which is a food importer, the consumption loss tends&#13;
to be high. For the CL and PE economies, which import capital goods, the&#13;
decline in GDP falls most heavily on investment. The rate of real investment&#13;
which is around 20 percent of GDP in the base run for the three economies&#13;
falls to 17 percent in both the CL and PE economies.&#13;
In addition to variations in real investment, the different policy&#13;
adjustments have important variations in incidence among socioeconomic&#13;
groups. Which groups bear the brunt of adjustment across the three economies&#13;
and is it the same groups that lose the most under both devaluation and&#13;
premium rationing? Can any group benefit in absolute terms and experience a&#13;
rise in real income? We explore these questions in this section.&#13;
Before examining the magnitudes of distributional shifts, it&#13;
is useful to review the various mechanisms whereby the external shock affects&#13;
the distribution of earned income. First, on the supply side the change in&#13;
relative net prices affects the distribution of value added between sectors&#13;
and, within sectors, the distribution of value added between wages and rents.&#13;
These shifts determine, after taxes, the distribution of earned nominal income&#13;
among the socioeconomic groups. Second, the distribution of income is affected&#13;
by differential changes in the cost of living across groups. The relevant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
prices are those of composite goods (which include imports). Third, the&#13;
distribution of income is affected by transfers which here arise from the&#13;
distribution of import licenses and hence premia.&#13;
Consider first the distributional shifts associated with changes&#13;
in net prices. As a first approximation, divide the economy into two sectors,&#13;
agriculture and manufacturing, and assume that labor is perfectly mobile&#13;
between them while capital is immobile. Furthermore, assume a fixed wage&#13;
differential, CD, between agriculture (A) and manufacturing (M). 1/ In&#13;
Figure 1, OOM represents the total labor force in the economy, the vertical&#13;
axes measure the wage of labor in the two sectors, and the two curves indicate&#13;
the marginal revenue product of labor. Prior to the shock, the equilibrium&#13;
distribution of the labor force is given by L0    with labor income given by the&#13;
two rectangles under the wage lines W    and W0 , and capitalists- income given&#13;
A      M   adcptlssicm               ie&#13;
by the triangular region between the wage lines and the respective marginal&#13;
revenue product (MRP) curves.&#13;
Now suppose that the external shock raises the net price agricul-&#13;
tural terms of trade, thereby shifting the MRP curve in agriculture. Clearly&#13;
capitalists in the manufacturing sector lose. On the other hand, the per unit&#13;
rents of capitalists in agriculture rise by more than the percentage increase&#13;
*in the agricultural net price. 2/   Finally,. the increase in the wage rate&#13;
0     1&#13;
(WA to WA) is less than the increase in the agricultural net price terms of&#13;
*1/  'This differential is-structural in that it is--assumed to be part of&#13;

trade, so that labor gains in terms of manufacturing but loses in terms of&#13;
agriculture. Hence, to determine what happens to labor's real income we must&#13;
consider its cost of living.&#13;
As can be seen from Figure 1, the magnitude of income changes&#13;
depends on the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital (a) in the&#13;
two sectors and on the intensity with which the two factors are used in both&#13;
sectors.  A large value for aA combined with a small value forcaM    and/or a&#13;
high labor share in agriculture and a low labor share in manufacturing would&#13;
lead to a flat MRPA and to a steep MRPM curve which in turn would imply that&#13;
labor's income in terms of agriculture would rise. Since we assume the same&#13;
(unitary) elasticities of substitution between capital and labor across all&#13;
sectors, it is only differences in labor intensity between sectors which&#13;
influence the distributional outcome. Introducing organized labor which&#13;
is mobile within manufacturing does not alter the above mechanisms except&#13;
that they share the manufacturing capitalists' losses, the extent of sharing&#13;
being inversely related to the elasticity of substitution between the two&#13;
labor catetgories (again assumed for simplicity to be everywhere unity).&#13;
Table 7 compares the impact of the external shock on selected&#13;
relative price indices for the three economies. Regardless of the selected&#13;
adjustment mechanism, the foreign terms of trade rises by 25 percent. The&#13;
impact on the net price agricultural terms of trade shows considerable&#13;
variation across economies and adjustment mechanisms. Not surprisingly,&#13;
it rises substantially in the ME economy (41 percent) which must replace&#13;
agricultural products which were previously imported. There is no change&#13;
for the PE economy while there is a 5 percent fall in the CL economy caused&#13;
by the increased intermediate input costs in agriculture which have a high&#13;

import cost component. The composite price agricultural terms of trade,&#13;
which is important in determining real income, follows the opposite course&#13;
of the capital goods price deflator. This movement explains why real con-&#13;
sumption falls so much in the ME economy.&#13;
While there is much variation in shifts in price indices which&#13;
contribute to shifts in the functional distribution of earned income,&#13;
relative shifts in cost of living indices between socioeconomic groups&#13;
are equally important in determining changes in real incomes across&#13;
socioeconomic groups. Table 8 provides ratios of cost of living indices&#13;
to their values in the Base Run for each socioeconomic group. The spread&#13;
across groups is quite wide. Thus, for instance, the cost of living of&#13;
farmers in the ME economy rises by 3 percentage points with devaluation&#13;
while that of capitalists falls by 9 percentage points.&#13;
Table 9 provides the group mean real incomes in the base run along&#13;
with the percent changes from the values in the base run. It thus indicates&#13;
which groups gain or lose in absolute terms. In turn, Table 10 provides&#13;
information on the relative distribution of incomes by giving changes in group&#13;
shares in total income. It is noteworthy that some groups gain in absolute&#13;
terms after the external shock in spite of the sizable fall in the economy-&#13;
wide mean income (see last row). Some striking patterns emerge: for the&#13;
manufacturing exporter, regardless of the adjustment mechanism, farmers&#13;
and agricultural capitalists always gain in absolute terms relative to the&#13;
Base Run. In the other two economies, no group gains significantly when&#13;
adjustment *is by devaluation. 1/ However, when there is adjustment by premium&#13;
rationing, industrial capitalists gain absolutely along with service sector&#13;
capitalists and, to a lesser extent, service sector labor.&#13;
1/   The only exception is the 0.7 percent increase for farmers in the PE&#13;
economy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
What emerges from these figures is that starting from a reasonable&#13;
spread in mean incomes among groups in the base run (see Table 9, columns&#13;
1-3), the distribution of premia, amounting to close to 10 percent of GDP,&#13;
raises the mean income of some recipient groups by up to 25 percent. No&#13;
wonder that the choice of policy instruments is such a politically sensitive&#13;
topic.&#13;
Consider, for example, service sector capitalists. They are&#13;
the largest and least well-off of the capitalist groups. With adjustment by&#13;
devaluation, even their relative position in society is likely to deteriorate&#13;
as a result of the increase in the relative price of traded goods. However,&#13;
when they receive the premia associated with the licenses they are granted for&#13;
importing consumer goods, their mean income rises by almost 10 percent in the&#13;
PE economy and by 7 percent in the CL economy. But in the ME economy, where&#13;
import substitution in the primary sector is assumed achievable in the medium&#13;
run, the farmers and agricultural capitalists appropriate these rents through&#13;
higher domestic agricultural prices. In that economy, service sector capital-&#13;
ists gain little from a system of import licenses since imports of consumer&#13;
goods become effectively replaced by domestic substitutes.&#13;
Finally, one can take a more aggregate view of the distribution of&#13;
income along broad functional lines and lump all capitalists together in one&#13;
group. Table 10 indicates that, taken as a group, capitalists always improve&#13;
their relative position when they get premia, but in the case of devaluation&#13;
they only improve their position in the SM economy. It would thus appear that&#13;
devaluation is not a pol.tically easy adjustment policy to implement.&#13;
The relative position of marginal labor, the largest labor group in&#13;
each of the economies, declines in virtually all instances. Again, the swing&#13;

in its relative position is most pronounced in the ME economy. As is typical&#13;
in developing countries, we assume that the employed support the unemployed by&#13;
direct income transfers. 1/ Struggling to maintain real wages leads the&#13;
marginal labor group as a whole (including the unemployed) to mitigate their&#13;
relative income loss (4.4-2.2=2.2% loss) compared to premium rationing (2.6%&#13;
loss). With or without fixed real wages, the alternatives facing the poorest&#13;
are gloomy indeed.&#13;
In these experiments, aggregate measures of income inequality&#13;
such as the Gini coefficient hide more than they reveal.    Even when the&#13;
share of marginal labor falls over 4 percentage points relative to capita-&#13;
lists, the Gini coefficient never changes by more than 3 percentage points.&#13;
More revealing from a distributional standpoint is an analysis&#13;
of the composition of poverty. The results are given in Table 11 which&#13;
shows the proportion of total population in poverty, as well as the group&#13;
composition of people in poverty. The cut-off point taken here is a mean&#13;
income of 1.5 which, in the Base Run, implies that 14 to 21 percent of&#13;
the population is in poverty. 2/   Consider the ME economy:   it starts out&#13;
with 15.6 percent of its population in poverty; after the adjustment, between&#13;
21.7 percent and 25.5 percent of its population is in poverty. Given a&#13;
-population of 10 million in each one of the archetypes, it is easy to see that&#13;
a large fraction of society can be adversely affected, even when aggregate&#13;
measures of the relative distribution show little variation. An examination of&#13;
1/   In this model, this is done through transfers so that the unemployed&#13;
receive half the mean income of the employed.&#13;
2/ This corresponds approximately to $150 per capita in 1970.&#13;

the bottom half of that table indicates that there is a considerable change in&#13;
the group composition of the poverty population as a result of the external&#13;
shock.  In the ME economy, in addition to a greater number of people in&#13;
poverty there is a large shift in the composition of poverty away from the&#13;
primary sector towards the urban sector. Although for all three economies&#13;
there is an increase in the number of people in poverty as a result of the&#13;
deterioration in the foreign terms-of-trade, the composition of poverty varies&#13;
depending on the selection of adjustment mechanism. Thus, under devaluation,&#13;
for both the CL and PE economies, the proportion of farmers among those that&#13;
are in poverty declines, while the opposite occurs under premium rationing.&#13;

VI. Class Conflict and Policy Choice&#13;
The picture that emerges from comparing the impact of alterna-&#13;
tive adjustment mechanisms on the distribution of income in different economic&#13;
environments is complex. There are certainly significant changes in the&#13;
relative distribution among socioeconomic groups, with some groups gaining in&#13;
absolute terms in spite of an overall decline in real income due to the&#13;
external shock. Differences in economic environment alone suffice to make&#13;
different groups gain or lose, even with the same adjustment policy. Different&#13;
adjustment policies also have quite different effects on the distribution.&#13;
The fact that the choice of policies has a significant impact&#13;
on the distribution of income leads to a number of political questions that&#13;
go beyond the usual economic analysis of policy choice. Given the changes&#13;
in the distribution of income among socioeconomic groups induced both by&#13;
the external shock and the policy response, how is the distribution of&#13;
political power affected? How will the political struggle between the gainers&#13;
and losers decide the final choice of policy? Finally, assuming that one can&#13;
analyze how policies are selected when there are conflicting group interests,&#13;
is it likely that the same policy will be selected in different economic&#13;
environments?&#13;
To explore these questions, we start from a number of simple assump-&#13;
tions about the way that the social and political systems are structured.&#13;
First, assume that each group realizes how its income would be affected under&#13;
each policy regime. Second, that socioeconomic groups are distinct and care&#13;
only about their own interests. We thus assume that we have partitioned the&#13;
society into the important or politically relevant power groups, each pursuing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
its own interests with perfect knowledge. Third, assume that the&#13;
intensity with which any group cares about a given policy change is measured&#13;
by the relative difference in its income between the two situations.    Define&#13;
Y (P) as the mean income of group i under policy regime P. In our experi-&#13;
ments, P can be the following: B (Base Run), D (devaluation), P (premium&#13;
rationing), and P,W (premium rationing with fixed real wage). For example,&#13;
the intensity with which group i is for (+) or against (-) devaluation compared&#13;
to premium rationing as a function of its relative change in income is defined&#13;
by:&#13;
Ri(D;P) = (Yi(D)   - Y (P))/Y (B)                 (1)&#13;
i     i         ~~~i   i&#13;
In order to evaluate the political feasibility of any policy choice,&#13;
we must be able to compare the gains and losses between groups according to&#13;
some measure of their relative political power. Thus, while a group may have&#13;
a large gain-or loss, and so care a lot about a particular policy choice, it&#13;
may have little political power and so be unable to affect the.final choice.&#13;
We need.some weighting scheme reflecting relative political power to aggregate&#13;
the gains and losses across different socioeconomic groups. There is certainly&#13;
little agreement about how to derive such weights, so we have specified three&#13;
different schemes which are consistent with different theories of the sources&#13;
of political power and which should provide a reasonable range of values.&#13;
.The analysis.is not concerned with the more fundamental and difficult issues&#13;
relating to the theory of how the political process works.    Rather, given a&#13;
political system, we are trying to capture in a stylized.manner some of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
the elements which are likely to determine the course of policy selection&#13;
by those who are already in power. The mechanisms by which political&#13;
power is exercised are not explicity considered.&#13;
The first scheme assumes that relative political power is given&#13;
by shares in total population - "one person, one vote." The second scheme&#13;
assumes that relative political power is measured by relative shares in&#13;
total income - "one dollar, one vote." The third scheme assumes that the&#13;
political system is dominated by the economic elite and hence that the&#13;
relative political power of different groups is measured by their share&#13;
in the elite. In this third case, we assume that the elite is defined&#13;
as the top 5 percent of the overall personal income distribution and that&#13;
relative political power is measured by the socioeconomic composition of&#13;
this group.&#13;
The first scheme is rather naive but appealing to utilitarian&#13;
welfare economists, if not to cynical political scientists. The second&#13;
scheme is a kind of "effective demand" theory of the distribution of poli-&#13;
tical power with groups able to buy influence in proportion to their shares&#13;
in total income. Large groups are still important, even if they have a&#13;
relatively low mean income. The third scheme is really a simple oligarchy&#13;
that corresponds reasonably well to a naive Marxist view of how a capitalist&#13;
society works. This last measure, though somewhat extreme, is intended to&#13;
provide a first approximation of how policy decisions are made in countries&#13;
where power is concentrated in the hands of the capitalist class. 1/&#13;
1/   Note that the choice of the top 5 percent of the overall distribution is&#13;
completely arbitrary. In general, the smaller the elite, the more&#13;
relative power is ascribed to capitalists. Given the way we generate the&#13;
overall distribution, it is a simple matter computationally to change the&#13;
definition of the elite. For a description of the tecinique, see Dervis,&#13;
de Melo and Robinson (1981), Chapter 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Table 12 gives the three measures of relative political power for&#13;
the different groups in the Base Run.   As one moves from group shares in&#13;
total population to shares in total income to shares in the elite population,&#13;
the relative power of capitalists increases. Of the other groups,.only&#13;
organized labor essentially maintains its relative share of political power&#13;
In all three measures.   All others lose, with marginal labor and service&#13;
sector labor having almost no representation in the elite in spite of their&#13;
large shares of the total population.&#13;
Under the three different policy regimes, population shares,&#13;
of course, do not change but there are significant changes in the relative&#13;
position of the different socioeconomic groups by the two other measures.&#13;
Table 12 also gives the average of the absolute values of change in group&#13;
shares for the different archetypes and different policy regimes. Except&#13;
in the ME economy, devaluation leads to much less change in group shares&#13;
-than either premium rationing or premium rationing with a fixed real wage.&#13;
The,two premia policy regimes have a similar impact on the relative position&#13;
of different groups.   One might argue that the average absolute:change in&#13;
group shares is a rough indicator of the,extent of social-and political&#13;
disruption caused by a particular policy since..socioeconomic groups can be&#13;
expected.to resist.any change in their relative.power in the polity.    Thus in&#13;
the CL and.-PE economies, devaluation is the policy regime that is-the least&#13;
disruptive of.the'existing political order.:Whether,this,'fact makes devalua-&#13;
tion more or less desirable is a question that cannot be answered without&#13;

considering the desirability of the existing order, an analysis well&#13;
beyond our scope. 1/&#13;
Given the "political power" shares in Table 12 and the informa-&#13;
tion on changes in the mean incomes of the socioeconomic groups, we can&#13;
undertake an analysis of the political feasibility of different policy&#13;
regimes.  Equation (1) defined Ri(Pi;P2) which measures the relative&#13;
gain or loss for group i between policy regimes PI and P2.      Expressions&#13;
for the average gain of the gainers and the average loss of the losers,&#13;
weighting by political power shares, are given by:&#13;
G(P1;P2)=£i WiRi(PI;P2)     iWi for all Ri &gt; 0          (2)&#13;
L(P 1;P 2)  EiwiRi(PI;P2) /  iWifor all Ri  &lt; 0&#13;
where&#13;
Pl,P2 are policy regimes,&#13;
W      is the relative power weight of group i, and&#13;
R      is the relative gain of group i from equation (1)&#13;
The average gain and loss functions reflect the intensity with&#13;
which different groups support or reject one policy compared to another.&#13;
The political feasibility of one policy compared to another depends, in&#13;
addition, on the relative political power of the gainers compared to the&#13;

political strains that accompany economic development. For an&#13;
entry into this literature, see Huntington and Nelson (1976).&#13;

losers. Given that we used relative political power weights in defining the&#13;
average gains and losses, G and L, the political feasibility of a particular&#13;
policy choice depends on whether the weighted difference between G and L is&#13;
positive or'negative.    We can thus define an index of political feasibility,&#13;
F, which is equal to this weighted difference. It is also just equal to the&#13;
weighted average of the relative gains, R1, over all groups, gainers and&#13;
losers:&#13;
F(P1;P2) = EiWiRi(PI;P 2))&#13;
Note that since we have three different political power weighting schemes,&#13;
there are three different feasibility indices for pairwise comparison of&#13;
policy regimes.&#13;
Table 13 presents the average gains and losses of the gainers&#13;
and losers, G and L, as well as the index of political feasibility, F,&#13;
for all pairwise comparisons of the three different policy regimes. In&#13;
each pairwise comparison of policies, the first"column gives the relative&#13;
political power of the gainers. We have already discussed which groups&#13;

tion of the gainers and losers does vary across archetype economies and&#13;
policy regimes. However, within each archetype and pairwise comparison,&#13;
the differences in G, L and F are due only to the different political&#13;
weighting schemes used.&#13;

Consider, for example, the comparison of devaluation with preniun&#13;
rationing. As the political weighting scheme goes from population shares&#13;
to elite shares--democracy to oligarchy--the relative power of the gainers&#13;
declines substantially. In the comparison of premium rationing with and&#13;
without a fixed real wage (the last four columns), the effect is reversed,&#13;
with the political weight of the gainers increasing with the more oligarchic&#13;
weights. In the first comparison, the gainers tend to be the small farmers&#13;
and laborers whose population share is high but whose representation in the&#13;
top 5 percent is small. In the last comparison, the gainers are everybody&#13;
but marginal and organized labor, so their weight is high under all three&#13;
schemes, but especially so for elite shares.&#13;
The average gains and losses, G and L, measure the intensity with&#13;
which the gainers and losers care about the outcome. For the first two policy&#13;
comparisons, with a few exceptions (six out of eighteen, given the different&#13;
weighting schemes and archetypes), the feasibility index indicates that those&#13;
who care the most will determine the policy choice. 1/ In the third pairwise&#13;
comparison, between premium rationing with and without a fixed real wage, the&#13;
opposite is the case in all three archetypes for the first two weighting&#13;
schemes. Even though the losers lose more than the gainers gain, their weight&#13;
is so low that the feasibility index is always positive.&#13;
Table 14 summarizes the ranking of different policies based on&#13;
the pairwise comparisons in Table 13. It is interesting to note that&#13;
the various pairwise comparisons never violate transitivity. That is,&#13;
if policy P1 is preferred to P and P   is preferred to P3. it is always&#13;
1/   Note, however, that the measures of intensity also reflect the relative&#13;
political power of different socioeconomic groups since they use the&#13;
political power weights in defining the average gains and losses.&#13;

true that the pairwise comparison shows that P1 is preferred to P3. as&#13;
would be predicted by assuming transitivity.&#13;
Across all three economies, devaluation is the most preferred&#13;
policy under the democratic weighting scheme while premium rationing is&#13;
the most preferred under both of the other weighting schemes. Indeed,&#13;
with one exception (PE economy, income share weights) devaluation is the&#13;
least preferred policy under the other schemes. It is interesting that&#13;
devaluation, which skews the distribution of income the least, always pre-&#13;
vails in a more democratic political system. Noting that historically&#13;
more democratic political processes tend to emerge in the more developed&#13;
countries, one might speculate that the Kuznets U hypothesis (that the&#13;
distribution of income first becomes worse and then improves as the process&#13;
of development unfolds) is at least partly related to changing policy&#13;
choices as political power shifts over time.&#13;
There is remarkable agreement in policy rankings, given the&#13;
choice of weights, across the three archetype economies. This is true&#13;
in spite of the fact that the particular groups which gain or lose, and&#13;
the magnitudes of their gains and losses, vary widely. Although our par-&#13;
ticular choices of policy regimes to compare were purposely made to enhance&#13;
their differences, it is tempting to conclude that there are generalizations&#13;
about the political feasibility of different policies that are valid for a&#13;
wide variety of economic environments0 The universal dominance of devalua-&#13;
tion under a democratic weighting scheme and of premium rationing under the&#13;
other schemes is certainly consistent with casual observation of a wide&#13;
variety of countries, although our three simple weighting schemes do not come&#13;
close to capturing adequately the wide variety of political systems repre-&#13;
sented in the world.&#13;

VII. Conclusions&#13;
This paper has attempted to capture the variety of ways in which&#13;
semi-industrial developing countries have been affected by the recent external&#13;
shocks. Caught between rising costs on the import side and a shrinking of&#13;
markets on the export side, these countries have had to achieve a major&#13;
adjustment to restore equilibrium.    By constructing three archetype economies&#13;
that cover a broad range of initial conditions--resource endowments, past&#13;
trade policies, and economic structure--one can get a feel for the quantita-&#13;
tive importance of initial conditions in adjusting to the external shock.&#13;
While all three economies suffered, a somewhat surprising result is&#13;
that for the particular external shock we simulate (a decline in export&#13;
markets and an adverse movement in the international terms of trade), the&#13;
closed, rather than the open, economy is the most severely affected. This&#13;
result is due to the relative importance of imported intermediate inputs in&#13;
the closed economy. These inputs are crucial and cannot be easily replaced&#13;
by domestically produced intermediates, so the economy has to bear the full&#13;
brunt of their rising costs.&#13;
The composition of imports determines to a large extent whether the&#13;
burden of adjustment falls on consumption or investment. For the manufacturing&#13;
exporter (a food importer), the consumption loss tends to be high. On the&#13;
other hand, for the closed economy and for the primary exporter (which both&#13;
import capital goods), the decline in GDP falls most heavily on investment.&#13;
The rate of real investment, which is around 20 percent of GDP prior to the&#13;
shock, falls to 17 percent in the closed and primary exporting economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
How the distribution of income among socioeconomic groups is&#13;
affected by the external shocks depends both on initial conditions and&#13;
on the choice of adjustment policy. In general,. the distributional shifts&#13;
are most pronounced for the manufacturing exporter where farmers and agri-&#13;
cultural capitalists gain regardless of the selected policy while all cate-&#13;
gories of labor lose. In the other economies the response is more varied&#13;
with industrial capitalist losing under devaluation but gaining under a&#13;
policy of premium rationing of imports. Finally, when real wages are fixed,&#13;
the contractionary effect of the external shock is more pronounced for the&#13;
manufacturing exporter, which experiences a 10 percent fall in mean income&#13;
along with an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent.&#13;
The picture that emerges from comparing the impact of alter-&#13;
native adjustment mechanisms on the distribution of income in different&#13;
economic environments is complex. In particular, the distribution&#13;
of premia, amounting to close to 10 percent of GDP, raises the mean income&#13;
of some recipient groups by up to 25 percent, in spite of a sizable decline&#13;
in overall mean income. With so much at stake, it is no surprise that the&#13;
choice of policy instrument is such a politically sensitive topic.&#13;
The fact that the choice of policies has a significant impact&#13;
on the distribution of income leads to a set of political questions that go&#13;
beyond the usual economic analysis of policy choice. The distribution of&#13;
political power is also affected by policy choice and hence the political&#13;
struggle between the gainers and the losers may well decide the final choice&#13;
of policy. By making quite strong assumptions about the way socioeconomic&#13;
groups operate in the political process, one can determine the policy most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
likely to be chosen. The analysis works with three different measures of&#13;
relative political power of socioeconomic groups, reflecting political&#13;
regimes ranging from democratic to oligarchic. While the simple assumptions&#13;
we have made do not do justice to the relevant theories of political and&#13;
economic conflict, we hope this study represents a useful first step and&#13;
indicates one important direction for future research in the application of&#13;
planning models for policy analysis.&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
Constructing Three Consistent Social Accounting Matrices&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
This appendix describes the method used to generate the three&#13;
archetype data sets used in the paper. Our approach is to work within&#13;
the framework of the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and to use a variety&#13;
of techniques to impose consistency at different stages of the gen-&#13;
eration of the data.-/  While the method is applied to archetypal,&#13;
made-up data sets based on "representative" countries, the approach&#13;
would also be useful in dealing with disparate data for a single country.&#13;
In assembling any economy-wide data base, whether real or&#13;
representative, inconsistencies emerge which require one to make decisions&#13;
about the relative reliability and accuracy of different data sources.&#13;
For example, it is usually the case that the national income and product&#13;
figures that emerge from input-output data are different from the official&#13;
national accounts. The foreign trade statistics in the input-output&#13;
accounts, the national product accounts, and the trade accounts are often&#13;
quite different.   Savings estimated from institutional flow-of-funds&#13;
data are often different from investment estimated from production accounts.&#13;
1/ For a description of a SAM see Pyatt and Thorbecke (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Finally, for example, the government flow-of-funds data are hard to&#13;
reconcile among the different accounts. Such inconsistencies are&#13;
sometimes due to variations in definitions among the different accounts&#13;
but, more often, they arise from differences in coverage and accuracy.&#13;
In practice, one is thus forced to assemble an economy-wide data base&#13;
in sequence, starting with what are considered to be the more reliable&#13;
data and forcing data assembled at later steps to be consistent with&#13;
control totals from former steps.&#13;
The method described below represents one such approach, with&#13;
a definite sequence of steps in which consistency is forced, applied to&#13;
constructing the data sets for the three archetype economies. There is,&#13;
however, nothing sacred about the particular sequence we have chosen&#13;
and one might well change it in particular applications. Also, in&#13;
practice, one generally iterates informally across the steps rather than&#13;
following a simple sequence. If data at a later step reveal glaring&#13;
inconsistencies, one often questions the reliability of the data at&#13;
earlier steps and goes back to reconsider them as well.&#13;
The flowcharts in Figures A-1 and A-2 present the adjustment&#13;
procedure in schematic form.-/     The steps are given by Roman numerals&#13;
and the additional data required at each stage are described in boxes at&#13;
the left of the figures. There are ten steps in all and forced reconciliation&#13;

in which inpuNt parametersiare changed is-done at three steps (indicated&#13;
by diamonds). The data which are distinctively different across the&#13;
three archetype economies are marked by an asterisk.&#13;
The adjustment is done in two distinct stages. First, in&#13;
steps I to IV in Figure A-1, the production accounts based on an&#13;
input-output table are reconciled.   Second, in steps V to X in Figure&#13;
A-2, the income and expenditure accounts are reconciled with the pro-&#13;
duction accounts. Thus, in this procedure, the input-output accounts&#13;
provide the starting point and are considered to be the controlling&#13;
data source.&#13;
2. Production Accounts&#13;
Starting from the input output accounts, steps I to III in&#13;
Figure A-1 generate the final demand columns and the total sectoral&#13;
value added row. Given total final demand and production by sectors,&#13;
the available supply of goods by sector for intermediate use is de-&#13;
termined as a residual. Given an initial set of input-output coefficients,&#13;
sectoral demand for intermediate goods is determined. Unless we&#13;
started with a consistent set of accounts, these demands will not&#13;
equal supply and some reconciliation procedure is required.&#13;
The procedure we use is called the "RAS" method and consists of&#13;
iteratively adjusting the rows and columns of the matrix of intermediate inputs&#13;

total supply of intermediate inputs by sectors, given the specified sectoral&#13;
production and final demand. The column control totals are total purchases&#13;

production minus sectoral value added.&#13;
If one started with a consistent input-output table, steps I to IV&#13;
would not be necessary. However, our intent was to build three distinctively&#13;
different data sets for three archetype economies. The major differences in&#13;
the three archetype economies are in their production, consumption, trade and&#13;
employment structures. Tables 13-1 to 13-3 in Chapter 13 indicate the major&#13;
differences. In addition to variations in the structure and volume of trade,&#13;
we also assuimpd that tariffs and subsidies differed, reflecting historical&#13;
differences in trade policies. We thus did not start with three sets of&#13;
consistent accounts. Instead, we started with the three different sets of&#13;

properties, see Bacharach (1970). The sum of the control colunn and&#13;
control row must be the same. In this case, the requirement is that total&#13;
value added equal total final demand (i.e., that national income equal&#13;
national product).&#13;

procedure s:immarized in Figure A-1 to create three consistent data s;ets. The&#13;
result is tha.. the input-output tables are slightly different between the&#13;
three economies.-/&#13;
The input variables which are significantly different across the&#13;
three archetype economies are marked by an asterisk. There was some adjustment&#13;
of input data required to achieve similar input-output structures and also to&#13;
achieve a similar balance of trade. Such adjustments were relatively minor,&#13;
but did provide a check of the "reasonableness" and consistency of the quite&#13;
different production and trade structures characteristic of the archetype&#13;
economies.&#13;
A.3. Income and Expenditure Accounts&#13;
Steps I to IV yield a consistent set of production and aggregate&#13;
income (value added) accounts. The next stage is to generate a consistent&#13;
set of disaggregated income and expenditure accounts. The procedure we use&#13;
is given in Figure A-2, Steps V to X and is essentially to generate the&#13;
functional, institutional and household distributions by disaggregating value&#13;
added. Receipt and expenditure balances are maintained for each account,&#13;
with forced adjustment required at two steps to ensure consistency with the&#13;
production accounts.&#13;
The total labor force is assumed to be the same across the three&#13;

been specified to give the control column totals.&#13;

economies and the shares of sectoral value added by different skill&#13;
categories of labor and by capital are also assumed to be the same.&#13;
However, the skill composition of the labor force and the sectoral&#13;
structures of employment differs across the economies, reflecting the very&#13;
different structures of production. The sectoral structure of employment&#13;
was adjusted informally so that wage differentials by skill categories and&#13;
sectors would be similar across the three economies. The result, in&#13;
Step V, is the functional distribution of income.&#13;
From the functional distribution, we move to the institutional&#13;
distribution in Step VI by generating the government and rest-of-the-world&#13;
accounts, in addition to the household and enterprise accounts. Tax&#13;
rates, both direct and indirect, are assumed to be the same. Given&#13;
the different tax bases, the total size of the government sector differs,&#13;
but not dramatically. Inputs for foreign remittances and capital inflows&#13;
are shown to indicate where they would enter, but they are assumed to be&#13;
zero in the three archetype economies.&#13;
The household distribution by socioeconomic groups is really&#13;
a reairanging of the "household" institutional distribution since, in&#13;
both, households are classified by source ofincome. The only new data&#13;
are the number of people in each household category. The labor households&#13;
correspond to employment by skill category, the numbers of farmers and&#13;
capitalists have been estimated so as to achieve sirmilar relative per&#13;
capita mean group incomes across the three economies.&#13;
In Step VIII, total savings are generated by applying fixed&#13;

Finally, in Step X, given average expenditure shares by&#13;
consuming groups, total demand for products by sector is calculated.&#13;
If this demand does not equal the sectoral supply of goods for consump-&#13;
tion computed in Step III, an adjustment prodedure is required. A rec-&#13;
tangular expenditure matrix is calculated with rows referring to sectors;&#13;

matrix of expenditures is then adjusted by the RAS procedure so that&#13;
it satisfies the column and row control, totals.-/ The results yield ne-'&#13;

The result of Step X is a set of average expenditure shares&#13;
by household groups such that consistency is achieved between the sec-&#13;
toral expenditures from the demand side and sectoral supplies of con-&#13;
sumer goods from the production side. If the RAS procedure yielded&#13;
dramatically different expenditure shares for the same socioeconomic&#13;
group across the archetype economies, the specification of the structure&#13;
of aggregate consumption in the production accounts would be suspect.&#13;
In fact, we did do some informal adjustment of the structure of con-&#13;
sumption in the production accounts so that there were no major dif-&#13;
ferences in the structure of demand by the same socioeconomic group&#13;
across the three economies.&#13;
4. Archetype Country Social Accounting Matrices&#13;
Tables 1 to 3 give the SAM's for the three archetype economies&#13;
(for the Base Runs described in the paper). Since production accounts&#13;
are discussed in some detail in the analysis, no sectoral disaggregation&#13;
is provided in the SAM's. Instead, the focus is on the institutional and&#13;
household accounts. To make the presentation more compact, various&#13;
accounts have been combined in the SAM's. Since capital income is all&#13;
assumed to accrue to "enterprises," there is no separate institutional&#13;
account for enterprises. Note that enterprise savings are shown as a&#13;

payment by the factor "capital" to the capital account (row 15, column&#13;
4). Also, in the factor account for "labor,", receipts by the four dif-&#13;
ferent skill categories have been aggregated. Separate wage payments&#13;
to different categories can be seen in the first four household cate-&#13;
gories which correspond to the four skill categories of labor. Similarly,&#13;
capital income in sectors has been aggregated in the factor accounts and&#13;
somewhat disaggregated in the household accounts. The "small farmers"&#13;
category of households receives a fraction (25 percent) of capital&#13;
income from agriculture which reflects the fact that they are landowners.&#13;
The "agricultural capital" category thus are larger farmers all of whose&#13;
incomes are assumed to come from land ownership.&#13;
Note that in the archetype economies, there are no remittances&#13;
or foreign capital inflows which accrue directly to households. Instead,&#13;
the balance of trade enters directly into the capital account and is thus&#13;
assumed to be saved. This treatment is simple, but is justified for our&#13;
purposes since we hold the balance of trade constant in the three econ-&#13;
omies and across all experiments in the paper.&#13;
A comparison of the three archetype SAM's indicates a number of&#13;
interesting contrasts. First, note that the price normalization rule&#13;
used in the CGE model is expressed in terms of composite good prices (see&#13;
Appendix B). However, since tariffs and export subsidies differ among&#13;
the three economies, so do domestic prices of imports and domestically&#13;
produced goods. The result is that although gross production is virtually&#13;

are different, being higher in the more open economies which have signi-&#13;
ficant export subsidies and hence higher domestic prices. The commodity&#13;
accounts (total absorption) follow a similar pattern.&#13;
Given their quite different production structures (and&#13;
slightly different relative prices) the three economies also have&#13;
different aggregate value-added ratios. The ratio is lowest for the&#13;
closed economy (CL) and highest for the primary exporter (PE) -- 54&#13;
percent and 60 percent, with the manufacturing exporter (ME) having a&#13;
ratio of 57 percent, in market prices. These differences, of course,&#13;
lead to significant differences in GDP among the three economies.&#13;
Columns 3 to 5 show the distributi6n of factor income to&#13;
households (rows 6 to 13). Table 4 gives the percent distribution of&#13;
nominal household income by socioeconomic groups. The quite different&#13;
structures of the three economies are clearly evident, with small&#13;
farmers and agricultural capitalists having small shares in the&#13;
manufacturing exporter (ME), followed by the closed economy (CL) and&#13;
primary exporter (PE). Industrial capitalists have by far the largest&#13;
share in the ME economy.&#13;
Columns 6 to 13 give the distribution of household income&#13;
among consumption, savings, and government (taxes). The aggregate rates&#13;
of direct taxation are similar across the three economies, being slightly&#13;
higher in the ME economy (12 percent; compared to 10 and 9 in the CL and&#13;

and PE economies). The aggregate household savings rates are essentially&#13;
the same in the CL and PE economies (11 percent), but are much lower&#13;
in the ME economy (8 percent). This result comes from the fact that&#13;
in the ME economy, government saving is much more important and hence&#13;
corporate saving and private saving, especially for capitalists, are&#13;
lower.   Government saving is 42 percent of investment in the ME&#13;
economy compared to 26 and 28 in the CL and PE economies.-/&#13;
Note finally that the different volumes of trade are evident&#13;
in the three SAM's by comparing the rest-of-the-world columns. The&#13;
volume of trade in the CL economy is about half that in the other two.&#13;
As noted above, the PE and ME economies have significant export&#13;
subsidies (shown as an entry from Government to Activities; row 1,&#13;
column 14). The average tariff rates are also quite different, more&#13;
than double in the CL economy compared to the other two.&#13;
5. Consumption: The Linear Expenditure System&#13;
In the construction of the three archetype SAM's, average&#13;
expenditure shares by the different classes of consumers were given&#13;
exogenously and then adjusted to achieve consistency with the production&#13;
1/   Government saving is higher because, given the larger capitalist&#13;
income in the ME economy, the direct tax take is higher (given that&#13;
the tax rate is highest on capital income). The effect is to shift&#13;
savings from capitalists and enterprises to government.&#13;
&#13;

accounts. The CGE model requires the.specification of a complete set&#13;
of expenditure equations-and-A variety of expenditure systems have&#13;
been used in various models. In the model used in this paper, we have&#13;
specified the Stone-Geary linear expenditure system (LES). For each&#13;
socioeconomic. group, consumer demand is given by (omitting a group&#13;
subscript).:&#13;
C=      + pi[Y_      p  y.]                                (1)&#13;
where Y is total nominal expenditure for the group, yi are the committed&#13;
expenditures of "subsistence minima" in physical terms and 61 are the&#13;
marginal budget shares which determine the allocation of supernumerarv&#13;
income (i.e., expenditure above that required for pur.:h:sing the sub-&#13;
sistence minima).I/&#13;
Given the average budget shares, there are a variety of ways&#13;
to esti,mate the parameters of the system depending on the exten. and&#13;
quality of available data. For our archetype data sets, we have cho-&#13;
sarn to compute the parameters of the LES for e-ach grc-.p --'en endogenous-&#13;

with   respect to income (often called the "Frisch parameter")&#13;
In the LES, the Frisch parameter is equal to the ratio of total&#13;
expenditure to supernumerary expenditure:&#13;
= -Y/(Y-S),   S = Z P. *Y                                  (2)&#13;
Given the average budget shares and expenditure elasticities,&#13;
the marginal budget shares are given by:&#13;
Bi = Ei ai                                                   (3)&#13;
where Li are the expenditure elasticities and cai are average budget&#13;
shares. Note that the marginal budget shares must sum to one which&#13;
is equivalent to imposing the condition, known as Engel aggregation,&#13;
that the sum of the expenditure elasticities weighed by average budget&#13;
shares must equal one.&#13;
The subsistence minima,        are related to the other&#13;
parameters according to the following equation:&#13;

Our estimates of the average budget shares, income elasticities,&#13;
and Frisch parameter are based on various cross-country studies, espe-&#13;
cially Lluch, Powell and Williams (1977).-1 They estimate that the Frisch&#13;
parameter rises from -7.5 to -2.0 as per capita income rises from $100&#13;
to $3,000 (in 1970 US dollars).-2    Our archetype countries are assumed&#13;
to have a per capita GDP of about $500 which, given the various group&#13;
mean incomes, implies that the Frisch parameter ranges from -5.0 to&#13;
-1.6. The estimates we have used are given in Table 5, along with the&#13;
average budget shares and income elasticities.&#13;
Given the parameters of the LES, the own and cross price&#13;
elasticities of demand can be computed from the following equations:&#13;
nii = -Cit (PiYt/Y)   ((5)&#13;
=i ECi (Y iYi /)(6)&#13;
In our eight-sector model, there is consumer demand for only&#13;
five sectors. No distinction is made between durables and non-durables.&#13;
The own price elasticities of demand for food range from -0.35 to -0.55&#13;
across the groups, while that for services range from -0.35 to -1.07.&#13;

Appendix B&#13;
The Equations of the Model&#13;
This appendix presents the complete set of equations&#13;
describing the model. All endogenous variables are denoted by&#13;
capital Roman letters; exogenous variables and parameters by capital&#13;
Roman letters with a bar ot Greek letters; and policy variables by&#13;
small Roman letters.    Subscripts i, q, and g refer to sectors,&#13;
labor categories, and socioeconomic groups. Superscripts m, d,&#13;
and e are used to distinguish imported, domestically produced, and&#13;
exported goods. An expanded version of this Appendix is available&#13;
on request.&#13;
1. Trade Aggregation Functions&#13;
The composite good in each sector is defined as a CES aggre-&#13;
gation of domestically produced (D ) and imported (Mm) goods.&#13;

4. Export Supply&#13;
d ...e .d&#13;
E  = S X&#13;

The export supply ratio, Si , is given exogenously.&#13;
5. Foreign Exchange Market&#13;
In equilibrium the excess demand for foreign exchange&#13;
must equal zero:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

e         0&#13;
£ wt *i - Zir1 Et ' 0&#13;
The exchange rate, R, is the endogenous variable which adjusts so&#13;
as to clear the market for foreign exchange. Imports are given by&#13;
d    e d&#13;
(3) and exports from (4) i.e., Ei = SiXi.&#13;
6. Production Functions&#13;
d    -_--ct  1-ct            iq&#13;
X    A iK i            = 1 Li iq&#13;
Technology is described by two-level Cobb-Douglas production functions.&#13;
Sectoral capital stocks are fixed. Intermediate goods are required&#13;
according to fixed input-output coefficients.&#13;
7. Net Prices&#13;

- 88 -&#13;
These equations deduct the fixed intermediate input costs to provide&#13;
the net receipts to the firm of selling a unit of output; Pi is the&#13;
price of a unit of the composite good and ti is the value-added sub-&#13;
d~~~~~~~~&#13;
sidy (or tax). Pi is the domestic price. The composite good price&#13;
equation is the cost function dual to the trade aggregation function,&#13;
equation (1).&#13;
8. Factor markets&#13;
The demand for labor of each skill category in each sector&#13;
is given by solving the first-order conditions for profit maximization:&#13;
W mp   .      : &#13;
iajLj&#13;
Where Li is the labor aggregate defined in equation (6). The aggregate&#13;
supply of labor in each skill category is assumed fixed. The average&#13;
wages, Wq, are determined endogenously so as to clear the labor mar-&#13;
kets; i.e., achieve zero excess demands:&#13;
E L     -  L   -   0&#13;
iq &#13;
unless the real wage is fixed in which case the above equation is&#13;
dropped and replaced by:&#13;
_         W&#13;
w    -  T v p   S&#13;
qi     q &#13;
where the Qi are weights in the price index that defines the real wage W&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
9. Income Distribution and Macro Balances&#13;
The average income of all groups -- different types of wage&#13;
earners, farmers and recipients of non-wage income -- are determined&#13;
endogenously. The distribution of income within each group is given&#13;
by a two-parameter lognormal distribution function. The logvariance&#13;
is exogenous and the logmean is a function of the endogenous group&#13;
mean income.  The equation is p   = log(Y ) - 1/2 G2   where Y  is group&#13;
mean income and a2 is the logvariance.&#13;
Aggregate investment is determined by applying fixed savings&#13;
rates to the income of the various institutions in the economy: enterprises,&#13;
households and government.   Foreign cap'tal inflow is also assumed to be&#13;
saved. The allocation of total investment to sectors is given exogenously.&#13;
The demand for investment goods by sector of origin, Zi, is calculated by&#13;
assuming a fixed composition of aggregate capital which differs across sectors.&#13;
10. Consumer Demand Equations&#13;
Consumer demands for composite goods are given by a separate&#13;
set 6f linear expenditure functions for each consuming group:&#13;
pi Cig      [Pi .ig + 6ig(Cg - 9  Pi Yjg)] Ng&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Where C   is aggregate group consumption and N       is the number of&#13;
people in each group.     y and ( are parameters of the system.&#13;
11. Product Markets&#13;
d&#13;
Domestic prices, Pi, are determined endogenously so as to&#13;
clear the product markets, making the excess demand for goods in each&#13;
market equal zero:&#13;
d     d _d&#13;
D  +E    - x   = &#13;
i     i    i&#13;
d     d    d     d    d&#13;
Where Di = F. + Ci + G     + Zi    The demands are solved behaviorally in&#13;
terms of composite goods. The ratios of domestic to composite goods,&#13;
d     d&#13;
ri =D.I/Q, are given by an equation analogous to (3).          Thus:&#13;
*  d       d   -     d    d       d        ;d    -    d Z     d  -    d.&#13;

12. Price Normalization&#13;
The normalization rule maintains a constant price level&#13;
measured by a wholesale price index:&#13;

Where Q iis base-year production weights.&#13;
Table Al summarizes the endogenous variables and the associated&#13;
equations. The exchange rate, wages and prices are determined so as&#13;
to clear the foreign exchange, labor, and product mar~kets. The system&#13;
can only determine relative prices, so an additional price normalization&#13;
equation is required to complete the system.&#13;

            Trade adjustment policies and income
            distribution in three archetype developing economies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper explores quantitatively the
            macroeconomic and distributional impacts on non-oil
            producing, semi-industrial developing countries of external
            shocks originating in the world economy - in particular,
            rising costs of imports and shrinking export markets. The
            empirical effects of the same external shock are modelled
            for three different archetype economies: a primary exporter,
            a manufacturing exporter, and a closed economy. Three
            different policy-adjustment regimes are considered:
            devaluation, premium rationing of imports (import licenses),
            and premium rationing in an environment with a fixed real
            wage for unskilled labor. The results show that differences
            in resource endowments and initial conditions strongly
            affect the impact of a given adjustment policy on both the
            economic structure and the distribution of income.
