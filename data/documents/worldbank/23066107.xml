Attachment 1&#13;
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative Charter&#13;
Adopted on July 6, 2007 and amended on July 11, 2013&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
1.     Introduction&#13;
1.1    The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") and the International&#13;
Development Association ("IDA") (collectively, the "Bank"), the International Monetary Fund ("IMF") and&#13;
all donors ("Donors") to one or more trust funds (collectively, the "Trust Fund") for the Financial Sector&#13;
Reform and Strengthening Initiative ("FIRST") have adopted the present charter (the "Charter").&#13;
1.2    Launched in 2002, FIRST is a collaborative arrangement providing for a technical assistance ("TA")&#13;
facility designed to support growth and poverty reduction in low- and middle-income countries by promoting&#13;
stable, deep and diverse financial sectors. The FIRST arrangement is built upon close collaboration between&#13;
the Bank and the IMF, both to leverage institutional expertise, and as the designated implementing agencies&#13;
for FIRST TA. This arrangement also seeks to promote collaboration among a wide range of institutions,&#13;
including other bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks.&#13;
1.3    The Charter sets out the governance arrangements of FIRST that encapsulate this collaborative&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
2.     Basic Principles&#13;
2.1    Following are basic principles that will guide FIRST (the "Basic Principles"):&#13;
2.1.1  A demand-driven approach with open access&#13;
FIRST aims to be demand-driven and open in its approach, as a strong advocate of financial sector&#13;
development, and seeks to identify effective new ideas and modalities in the delivery of TA. To this end,&#13;
FIRST accepts technical assistance requests from a wide range of sources for the benefit of client countries.&#13;
As the designated implementing entities, the Bank and the IMF will prepare funding proposals to be&#13;
considered for FIRST financing.&#13;
2.1.2 Additionality&#13;
FIRST seeks to ensure that it funds activities that are complementary to those being funded from other&#13;
sources and that its funding does not substitute for or displace more suitable or appropriate assistance&#13;
available from other sources. FIRST seeks to excel in efforts to promote learning and knowledge sharing in&#13;
the area of financial sector TA.&#13;
2.1.3  Harmonization, transparency, and accountability&#13;
FIRST promotes a model of partnership in line with the principles of: ownership, alignment, harmonization,&#13;
managing for results and mutual accountability. For FIRST, this involves introducing clear accountabilities&#13;
in program management, setting targets, assessing effectiveness, and monitoring results. FIRST's partnership&#13;
model also seeks to promote learning and knowledge sharing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
2.1.4  TA Beneficiaries&#13;
(a)    Beneficiaries of FIRST TA are policy makers, regulatory bodies, government agencies,&#13;
international financial institutions, and, under limited circumstances, quasi-public institutions (such&#13;
as self-regulatory organizations and industry associations).&#13;
(b)    Beneficiaries of FIRST assistance must be from either low- or middle-income countries at&#13;
the time project proposals receive final approval. "Low-income countries" are those defined by the&#13;
Bank as eligible to receive low or no interest credits or grants from IDA. "Middle-income countries"&#13;
are those defined by the Bank as eligible to receive IBRD financing.&#13;
3.     Objectives&#13;
3.1    FIRST's overall objective is to help strengthen financial systems in low- and middle-income&#13;
countries so that they make a strong and positive contribution to economic growth and help reduce poverty&#13;
and income inequality. FIRST's activities are currently only those financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    FIRST's specific areas of focus are to:&#13;
3.2.1  Finance TA in the areas of financial sector regulation, supervision and development in response to&#13;
country demands, provide support to countries to strengthen their financial systems or implement standards&#13;
and codes in advance of Financial Sector Assessment Programs ("FSAPs") or Reports on Standards and&#13;
Codes ("ROSCs"), and facilitate systematic follow-up of related recommendations.&#13;
3.2.2  Advise on the preparation and implementation of action plans, development programs and reforms in&#13;
the financial sector.&#13;
3.2.3  Promote coordination in the delivery of financial sector TA and capacity building, drawing&#13;
particularly on private sector expertise.&#13;
3.2.4  Support research on and the dissemination of best practices and useful tools related to financial&#13;
sector reform and development in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;
3.2.5  Work with international standard-setting bodies and other relevant partners to broaden the base of&#13;
providers supporting countries' efforts to implement standards and codes in accordance with FSAP and&#13;
ROSC recommendations and strengthen their financial systems.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;

the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;

2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;

3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2 %) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of eleven point seventy six percent (11.76%) of the total Contributions under all Administration&#13;
Agreements. The Donors acknowledge and agree that such costs will be approved each year on the basis of&#13;
annual budget amounts presented to the Governing Council.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;
to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Transfers to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall enter into a transfer agreement (the "Transfer Agreement") with the IMF to set forth&#13;
the terms and conditions of any Trust Fund funds transferred to them. Following the transfer of funds by the&#13;
Bank from the Trust Fund to the IMF (the "Transferred Funds"), IMF shall be responsible for the use of such&#13;
funds, and the Bank shall have no further responsibility with respect of such funds.&#13;
4.2    The Donors acknowledge and agree that the Bank has no responsibility, under the Administration&#13;
Agreement or otherwise for: (i) the use of the Transferred Funds; (ii) the implementing, monitoring,&#13;
supervising, evaluating, or providing quality assurance for activities financed by the Transferred Funds; (ii)&#13;
providing Donors with financial, progress, results or impact reporting for activities financed by the&#13;
Transferred Funds; and (iii) any misuse or misprocurement with respect to the Transferred Funds; or (iv)&#13;
pursuing any Donor interests or IMF undertakings with respect to the Transferred Funds.&#13;
4.3    The Donors further acknowledge and agree that any financial reports with respect to the Trust Fund&#13;
funds transferred to the IMF and the reports with respect to the progress of the implementation of IMF&#13;
activities are the responsibility of the IMF.&#13;

5.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts, disbursements&#13;
and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World Bank's Trust&#13;
Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and liabilities under the&#13;
Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to&#13;
receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be&#13;
made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
5.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;

comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors&#13;
concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's&#13;
external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
5.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;
such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such&#13;
external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
6.     Progress Reporting&#13;
6.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with annual reports on the progress of activities financed by the&#13;
Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank shall&#13;
furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six (6)&#13;
months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and&#13;
conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
7.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
May 31, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the&#13;
extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all&#13;
the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration&#13;
Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor&#13;
relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency&#13;
amounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-14-&#13;
7.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;

paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants&#13;
and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the&#13;
Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement; unless&#13;
otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
8.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
8.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;

Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such&#13;
related information.&#13;

claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
