            Afridev handpumps in Pakistan: developing
            private sector supply chains to deliver rural water technology
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Ten years ago, the Afridev handpump was
            relatively unknown outside of Africa. Today it is
            manufactured in three out of the four provinces of Pakistan
            and more than 80,000 locally manufactured Afridev handpumps
            have been installed in the region. This case study examines
            how this transformation occurred, and the effectiveness of
            the current supply chain for Afridev handpumps and spare
            parts in Pakistan. In particular, it focuses on the
            increasing importance of the private sector in a market that
            has been dominated by External Support Agencies (ESAs) and
            the local government.
