ESTIMATING TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH&#13;
IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY&#13;
This paper studies the sources of growth from the supply side in&#13;
Turkish manufacturing over the period 1963-1976. Primary factors and inter-&#13;
mediate inputs are explicitly included in both the theoretical framework&#13;
and the empirical analysis. The empirical analysis is based on data on&#13;
output and factor inputs, at the two-digit industry level including eighteen&#13;
manufacturing industries. The major findings are that: there is (1) a secular&#13;
declining trend in productivity growth over the period due perhaps to the&#13;
continuing reliance on an import-substitution development strategy, (2) periods&#13;
of especially low productivity growth are (roughly) those in which there were&#13;
especially restrictive foreign exchange controls, (3) the public sector had&#13;
a higher rate of total factor productivity than the private sector although it&#13;
was absolutely less efficient, and (4) there was no pronounced tendency for&#13;
import-substitution industries to have higher total factor productivity growth&#13;
than more traditional industries.&#13;

ESTIMATING TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY&#13;
ArLne 0. Krueger and Baran Tuncer*&#13;
In examining the growth performance of developing countries, a wide&#13;
variety of statistics have been collected and analyzed. Chenery has pro-&#13;
vided profiles, or norms, of a number of variables, such a,3 the extent&#13;
of import substitution, the share of manufacturing in GNP, exports as a&#13;
fraction of GNP, investment and savings as a fraction of national income,&#13;
capital inflows, and so on, as a function of size of country, per capita&#13;
incomes, and other variables. These data are descriptive statistics,&#13;
and do not directly yield insights into determinants of growth rates&#13;
or per capita income levels, or other variables of concern. Nonetheless,&#13;
they are highly useful as a starting point for analysis, and have received&#13;
wide attention in the literature. Analysts of individual countries have&#13;
frequently found an analysis of the deviations of their country from the&#13;
Chenery norms to be a valuable first step.&#13;
Surprisingly, there has been no examination of the behavior of total&#13;
factor productivity growth (TFPG) in any of this literature.   In part, the&#13;

neglect has probably stemmed from a paucity of data, but it undoubtedly&#13;
has been to a large degree self-perpetuating.&#13;
Failure to analyze TFPG has been so all-pervasive that there has been&#13;
little attention paid to it, either analytically or emnpirically, anywhere&#13;
in the development literature. Yet all the evidence, from both developed&#13;
and developing coutLtries, strongly suggests that increased quantities of&#13;
inputs per head of factors of production cannot explain differences in&#13;
output per head, or total factor productivity, between countries, and&#13;
especially between the North and the South.&#13;
This paper reports on an attempt to begin to fill in thit gap in&#13;
our knowledge. We do four things: 1) we provide estimates of total factor&#13;
productivity growth rates for two-digit manufacturing industries in Turkey&#13;
over the period 1963-1976; 2) in so doing, a number of methodological issues&#13;
that arise in estimating the behavior of TFPG are discussed; 3) the findings&#13;
are utilized to examine, at least in a suggestive way, some hypotheses about&#13;
the determinants of growth in the manufacturing sector in Turkey; and 4)&#13;
we explore both the uses and the limitations of analysis of TFPG by analyzing&#13;
the relationship between sectoral and aggregate TFPG rates and by examining&#13;
apparent differences in efficiency between public and private sector firms&#13;
in Turkey.&#13;
Estimates of TFPG rates are of interest in their own right as descrip-&#13;
tive statistics. It is of course hoped that they will be even more useful&#13;
as others undertake comparable estimates for other countries. Below, we&#13;
1.  See the seminal contribution by Solow, who first challenged the view&#13;
that capital accumulation had accounted for economic growth and rising per&#13;
capita income in the United States. For reasons discussed below, we dis-&#13;
tinguish between accumulating quantities of factors and improved qualities&#13;
of factors. It is at least possible, if it is not tautological, that all&#13;
output increments are attributable to either increased quantities or qualities&#13;
of inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
summarize available data on rates of TFPG for individual manufacturing indus-&#13;
tries (for which, to our knowledge, the only estimates available are for&#13;
developed countries). One can, however, imagine that some industries might&#13;
experience higher rates of TFPG than others, especially if "infant industry"&#13;
considerations are present.    In that case, "normal" rates of TFPG in&#13;
developed countries' manufacturing industries might exhibit a different&#13;
structure from that found in developing countries.&#13;
Of course, it is also possible that country-specific policies (such&#13;
as investment licensing, quantitative restrictions upon trade and import&#13;
prohibitions, price controls, and restrictions upon technical assistance&#13;
arrangements) might affect both the fortunes of individual industries&#13;
within countries and the overall rate of manufacturing TFPG observed in&#13;
those countries. While an.wers to these questions must await the provision&#13;
of estimates of TFPG for a variety of countries, the Turkish data provide&#13;
at least one observation that may be useful in that analysis.&#13;
In ad(ition, rates of TFPG are of interest if they themselves are a&#13;
function of other variables. For example, it has long been widely believed&#13;
that certain effects of restrictive trade and payments regimes adversely&#13;
affect productivity. In particular, delays incurred in obtaining imported&#13;
inputs or spare parts, the necessity to substitute inferior domestic products&#13;
for imports or to use items of the wrong specification from a bilateral-&#13;
payments-agreetinent trading partner, the monopoly position conferred upon&#13;
1. In addition to the estimates presented here, we were able to obtain&#13;
data for a number of Turkish firms. Some interesting questions arise about&#13;
links between rates of TFPG for firms and for industries. Those questions&#13;
are addressed in Krueger and Tuncer, and are not dealt with here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

domestic producers by the quantitative restrictions imposed on imports,&#13;
may result in higher inputs per unit of output (or slower growth rates of&#13;
output per unit of input) than would occur under a more liberalized trade&#13;
and payments regime.&#13;
Thus, it is a plausible hypothesis that productivity growth might&#13;
uniformly be more rapid during periods of relative liberalization of the&#13;
foreign trade regime than during periods of severe "foreign exchange&#13;
shortage." During the latter periods, one might expect that all industries&#13;
would be adversely affected, but that industries more dependent upon im-&#13;
ports (i.e., those with higher fractions oL their purchased inputs origi-&#13;
nating from abroad) might be relatively more adversely affected. The data&#13;
on Turkish manufacturing industries' rates of TFPG provide some sugges-&#13;
tive evidence with regard to this hypothesis, although there are too few&#13;
degrees of freedom for rigorous statistical testing.&#13;
One might also conjecture that countries with more liberalized trade&#13;
regimes experience higher rates of TFPG in their manufacturing industries&#13;
than do countries with restrictive trade regimes. Such a hypothesis is&#13;
not testable, even in suggestive terms, until data on TFPG rates become&#13;
available for a variety of developing countries. However, Turkey has had&#13;
a generally fairly restrictive trade regime and, as will be seen, her&#13;
overall rate of manufacturing TFPG has been fairly low, even in contrast&#13;
with rates estimated for developed countries.&#13;
We start, in the next section, with some background information on&#13;
the 'urkish economy and the Turkish manufacturing sector that is necessary&#13;
for interpretation of our findings. In Section II, we then discuss the&#13;
TFPG measure and the evidence on TFPG rates available from other studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
In Section III, estimates of rates of TFPG for Turkish manlfacturing indus-&#13;
tries are presented and the evidence with regard to the hypotheses discussed&#13;
above is evaluated. The fourth section then discusses the links between&#13;
aggregated, sectoral, and industrial rates of TFPG, and then illustrates&#13;
some of the limitation of TFPG measures by examining the relative efficiency&#13;
levels of public and private sector industries in Turkey. A final section&#13;
considers promising lines for future research.&#13;
I.  EVOLUTION OF TURKISH MANUFACTURING -&#13;
Like most developing countries, Turkey's initial development policies&#13;
and programs were formulated and carried out in the context of a predomi-&#13;
nantly rural economy. Starting in the 1930s, a good twenty years before&#13;
most other developing countries, government policy began consistently to&#13;
encourage the rapid growth of the industrial, and especially the manu-&#13;
facturing sector, although the instruments of policy have differed from&#13;
time to time and World War II interrupted the effort.&#13;
For purposes of understanding the environment in which inputs, outputs,&#13;
and productivity grew during the 1963-76 period, four facets of policy are&#13;
of particular importance: 1) the varying degrees of restrictiveness of the&#13;
trade and payments regime and the evolution of other policy instruments&#13;
which might conceivably impinge on the growth of efficiency of Turkish&#13;
industries; 2) the structure of protection accorded to Turkish manufacturing&#13;
industries and the incentives confronting producers; 3) the relationship&#13;
between public and private enterprises and policy toward them within the&#13;
manufacturing sector; and 4) the behavior of the real wage and the real&#13;
cost of using capital over the period covered by the estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Phases in the Trade Regime and Other Incentives&#13;
Until the 1950s, policies toward industrialization were undertaken&#13;
primarily through the establishment of State Economic Enterprises (SEEs)&#13;
which undertook various manufacturing (and other) activities. The trade&#13;
regime was itself fairly liberal, except to the extent that access to&#13;
foreign markets was cut off during World War II.&#13;
By the early 1950s, there were SEEs producing manufactured goods&#13;
primarily in light consumer goods. Implicitly, encouragement to these&#13;
industries was given through government financing deficits, rather than&#13;
via trade restrictions. Starting in 1953, however, Turkey began experi-&#13;
encing serious difficulties witlh her balance of payments, largely because&#13;
of the inflationary pressures resulting from deficit financing and the con-&#13;
sequent excess demand for imports. The mid-1950s, until 1958, were a&#13;
period of severe import restriction.   Imports wE&#142;ie strictly licensed, with&#13;
a purpose to rationing scarce foreign exchange. Naturally, licenses were&#13;
not granted for goods which were produced domestically. As a result, the&#13;
protection accorded to manufacturing industry in general increased.&#13;
A devaluation of 1958, followed by a sharp drop in the rate of inflation&#13;
and a liberalization of imports, resulted in fairly liberal trade policies&#13;
in the early 1960s. To be sure, import licensing mechanisms remained intact,&#13;
although their stringency diminished noticeably after the 1958 devaluation&#13;
and the accompanying reduction in domestic excess demand. Also in the&#13;
early 1960s, however, a State Planning Organization (SPO) was established,&#13;
and that body was given considerable influence in formulating development&#13;
plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
The SPO wished to encourage further import substitution, and also to&#13;
increase the rate of investment. As an instrument to encourage the establish-&#13;
ment of new industries domestically, the import licensing system was employed&#13;
to prevent imports of goods competing with domestic production. Once a pro-&#13;
ducer had installed industrial capacity, he could generally request that&#13;
the government remove the items he produced from the list of permitted im-&#13;
ports, and expect that his request would be granted.&#13;
Thus, the Turkish trade regime of the 1960s especially after about&#13;
1965, was one in which prohibitive protection was virtually automatically&#13;
granted to any new industry. This, of course, provided a powerful incen-&#13;
tive for the establishment of new industrial activities and created a&#13;
sizable bias toward producing for the highly sheltered domestic market,&#13;
rather than -xpanding production of existing lines for purposes of export.&#13;
Partly because of reemerging inflationary pressures as the 1960s&#13;
progressed, and partly because of the excess demand for imports generated&#13;
by the stepped-up rate of investment and the intermediate goods imports&#13;
needed to sustain the import-substitution activities, the restrictiveness&#13;
of the trade and payments regime intensified in the late 1960s. By 1968&#13;
and 1969, there were significant delays in obtaining import licenses even&#13;
for spare parts and machinery replacement, as well as for intermediate&#13;
goods employed in import substitution industries. Thus, the restrictive-&#13;
ness of the trade regime resulting from the prohibitive protection given&#13;
to import substitution industries was further intensified by the inability&#13;
of the government to finance even those imports deemed desirable for&#13;
development purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In mid-1970, a major devaluation (from TL 9 to TL 15 per U.S. dollar)&#13;
was carried out.   The following three years were ones of relative   ease&#13;
in import licensing, as workers' remittances from Germany and greatly&#13;
increased export earnings both contributed to an easy foreign exchange&#13;
situation. The ease persisted for several years despite the fact that the&#13;
authorities were unable to neutralize the iaflow of foreign exchange, and&#13;
the resulting increase in the money supply triggered a much.more rapid&#13;
rate of inflation than had occurred in the 1960s.   By 1974, however, the&#13;
combination of internal inflation (at a fixed exchange rate) of 40 percent&#13;
annually over the 1970-73 period, combined with higher oil prices and a&#13;
deterioration in Turkey's terms of trade, all resulted in a reemergence&#13;
of excess demand for foreign exchange. To some extent, the government&#13;
was able to buffer the domestic economy from the impact of    severe foreign&#13;
exchange difficulties by borrowing from abroad. Nonetheless, starting in&#13;
1974, import licensing once again became increasingly restrictive, and that&#13;
trend continued throughout most of the 1970s.&#13;
One other facet of policy also deserves mention. That is, in 1972-73,&#13;
the government decided to introduce a set of "investment incentives" in an&#13;
effort to speed up the rate of investment. Although there had earlier been&#13;
a number of "incentives," such as delayed payment of import duties, and a tax&#13;
1. There is widely believed to be a considerable volume of unrecorded (arnd&#13;
presumably illegal) trade in Turkey. To some extent, this trade arose in&#13;
response to the restrictiveness of the regime, but it nonetheless implies&#13;
that official figures overstate the extent to which foreign exchange earnings&#13;
declined in the late 1970s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
allowance, the 1972-73 measures went well beyond this in that they con-&#13;
tinued the former, increased duty deferments and exemptions, and provided&#13;
for low rates of interest on loans. The result was an investment boom&#13;
of major magnitude. The incentives, which were equivalent to 54% of the&#13;
cost of the investment, were probably large enough to encourage relatively&#13;
indiscriminate investment in all sorts of economic activities which would&#13;
not have been justified, had there been even minimal selectivity in their&#13;
application.1&#13;
As the above description indicates, there were four major periods of&#13;
trade policy during the 1963-76 period covered by our TFPG estimates. The&#13;
first period, from 1963 to about 1967, was one of relative ease of the import&#13;
licensing system except for goods competing with comestic production. The&#13;
second period, from 1967 to 1970, was one of stringency of the import regime.&#13;
The thi;rd period, 1970 to 1973, corresponds to the period of relative ease&#13;
followLag the devaluation, while the fourth period, from 1973-76 was one&#13;
of increased difficulties in obtaining import licenses and indiscriminate&#13;
investment incentives.&#13;
If stringency of the foreign trade regime (and indiscriminate invest-&#13;
ment incenitives) results in efficiency losses, the periods 1963-67 and&#13;
1970-73 should have witnessed relatively higher rates of TFPG than the&#13;
2&#13;
periods 1967-70 and 1973-76.   On the other hand, if continuing import&#13;

2. In the terminology of the National Bureau of Economic Research project&#13;
on Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development the periods 1963 to 1967&#13;
and 1970 to 1973 correspond roughly to Phase IV regimes, whiile 1967 to 1970&#13;
and 1973 to 1976 correspond to Phase II regimes. See Krueger for more de-&#13;
tails on the 1960s.&#13;
The regime became increasingly restrictive after 1976. If data were available,&#13;
we would hypothesize that the observed rate of TFPG would be evein lower in tle&#13;
1976-79 period than it was in the 1973-76 period. Lack of data prevents us&#13;
from testing this hypothesis, but a test may be possible at a later date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
substitution results in new resources being committed to ventures which&#13;
are less and less economically efficient, one sbluld observe a secular&#13;
decline in the rate of TFPG.&#13;
Protective Content of the Regime&#13;
As already mentioned, domestic production of import substitutes was&#13;
encouraged throughout the 1963-70 period by removal of *the goods from the&#13;
list of eligible imports once domestic production capability had been&#13;
established. Thus, protection was granted primarily through quantitative&#13;
restrictions, rather than through tariffs, making it necessary to estimate&#13;
the restrictive content of the regime through direct price comparisons,&#13;
rather than with the tariff schedule. Even then, difficulties arise once&#13;
it is recognized that the intent of the regime was not to permit any&#13;
imports if domestic production sufficed, su that price comparisons may fail&#13;
to capture quality and other differences.&#13;
Nonetheless, the disparities between import and domestic prices revealed&#13;
by direct comparison are so great that they provide a good indication of the&#13;
degree of restrictiveness of the regime. A 1968 survey of import prices,&#13;
landed costs, and wholesale prices, revealed that the ratio of wholesale&#13;
prices to landed costs ranged, among manufactured commodities, from a low&#13;
of 1.87 (for unplated pipes and methyl alcohol) to a high of 13.56 for&#13;
artificial fibers.&#13;
To gain some idea of the structure of protection across industries,&#13;
it is necessary to obtain estimates for individual manufacturing sectors.&#13;
For the period under consideration there is a compilation of estimates of&#13;
domestic resource costs, covering 90 individual manufacturing industries&#13;
grouped into fourteen sectors (which are not precisely comparable to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sectoral classification given below, as can be seen by comparison of the&#13;
industry categories in Table 1 with those of Table 2 below).    A simple&#13;
average of the DRCs in each sector was then takern to yield the estimates&#13;
given in Table 1, where DRCs are expressed relative to an estimated plausi-&#13;
ble cutoff point for economically efficient industries in the late 1960s,&#13;
which was taken to be a DRC of TL 15 per dollar.    Thus, food and beverages&#13;
had a DRC estimated to be an average of TL 14.10, thus equal to 94 percent&#13;
of the maximum economically efficient range, while plastic products had an&#13;
average DRC of 37.05, or 2.7 times as high as that of food and beverages&#13;
and 2.47 times the maximal estimated economically efficient level.&#13;
The data under "mean DRC" represent simple averages of estimates for&#13;
individual industries within the sector, and therefore may not give an&#13;
accurate representation of the entire industry's situation.   Nonetheless,&#13;
we believe that the averages are broadly representative of the situation of&#13;
individual industries in the late 1960s: food and beverages, textiles,&#13;
forest products, leather products, and stone, clay and glass products were&#13;
all "traditional" industries and received (or needed) relatively little&#13;
protection from the trade and payments regime. By contrast, paper products,&#13;
rubber products, plastic products, iron and steel products, machinery and&#13;
parts and transport equipment were all industries in which import substitu-&#13;
tion was being actively encouraged. The relatively low DRCs for chemicals,&#13;
basic metals, and other metal products reflect primarily the fact that&#13;
import substitution was just starting in the first two industries.   Other&#13;
1. Baysan estimated effective rates of protection for 1968, but had legal&#13;
rates of tariff protection and then added a factor to allow for the pro-&#13;
tective effect of quotas.&#13;
2. As already mentioned, the actual exchange rate was 9 TL per dollar, and&#13;
the 1970 devaluation increased it to 15 TL per dollar.&#13;

The right-hand column of Table 1 gives the estimated variance of&#13;
DRCs within each sector. Since these, too, are unweighted, they can serve&#13;
only to give some id.ea of the spread of DRCs within industry categories.&#13;
As can be seen, the variance of DRCs in some sectors was extremely high,&#13;
although that outcome was sometimes the result of the inclusion of one&#13;
or two industries subject to extremely high rates of effective protection.&#13;
This was especially the case within industries in which some import sub-&#13;
stitution had occurred while there were still some goods not domesitcally&#13;
produced and imported which were treated as capital goods or intermediate&#13;
goods subject to low rates of duty.&#13;
Public Sector and Private Sector Enterprises&#13;
As already mentioned, a number of State Economic Enterprises (SEEs)&#13;
were founded in the 1930s in various manufacturing (and other) activities.&#13;
They were the earliest import-substitution industries, as there were few&#13;
private-sector firms except in traditional industries, and factories under&#13;
public ownership were set up in such diverse fields as textiles, sugar&#13;
refining, iron and steel, and cement. SEEs have continued to be important&#13;
in the manufacturing sector, entering such fields as paper and products,&#13;
fertilizers, heavy chemicals, metal products, and machine tools in the&#13;
1960s and 1970s. Indeed, at; will be seen below (Table 3), there are only&#13;
three two-digit manufacturing sectors in which no SEEs are operating.&#13;
The relative importance of the public sector in the value of manu-&#13;
facturing output has fallen since the early 1960s, but as late as 1976,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
SEEs accounted for 30 percent of manufacturing value added, with considerable&#13;
variation in their relative weight among two-digit industries.&#13;
It is a virtually unanimously-held view in Turkey that SEEs are inefficient.&#13;
Some of the reasons are political, as managers have been constrained to&#13;
hire additional employees on political grounds even when they were not&#13;
needed for production, pay scales have been subject to civil service rules,&#13;
and location decisions have been mandated on political, rather than efficiency,&#13;
grounds.&#13;
Except for a period during the 1950s when SEE output prices were held&#13;
artificially low (as an "anti-inflationary" measure), SEE outputs of manu-&#13;
facturing enterprises have competed in the marketplace with outputs of the&#13;
private sector. However, some SEEs have incurred fairly substantial losses,&#13;
and rates of profit have generally been so low that rates of return on&#13;
capital have been negligible.   This has happened despite the facts that:&#13;
1) SEEs were widely believed to have favorable access to import licenses&#13;
and to avoid payments of duties on imported inputs; 2) SEEs were subject&#13;
to lower rates of interest on their borrowings than were their private&#13;
counterparts; 3) SEEs were able to obtain some of their domestically-&#13;
produced purchased inputs at lower prices than were their private com-&#13;
petitors (especially by avoiding payment of some taxes);2 and 4) in some&#13;
manufacturing industries, and especially in fertilizers (in the chemical&#13;
sector), there have been outright subsidies to production in public sector&#13;
firms.&#13;
1. It may even be the case that with proper depreciation accounting, rates&#13;
of return would have been negative.&#13;
2. There were also cases where the opposite is believed to have occurred:&#13;
some SEEs apparently paid high prices for some inputs because of social policy.&#13;
This may have been more important in nonmanufacturing concerns, howqever.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Thus, a question of considerable interest is how the growth of TFPG in&#13;
public sector manufacturing enterprises has compared with that of private&#13;
sector firms in the same industries. There are also interesting questions&#13;
about absolute efficiency levels, which are examined in Section IV below.&#13;
Relative Costs of Capital and Labor&#13;
Until the early 1960s, the Turkish labor market was relatively compe-&#13;
titive, and wages appear to have been flexible and market-determined.  In&#13;
the early 1960s, however, social insurance regulations, laws strengthening&#13;
the power of unions, and minimum wage legislation were enacted. As a con-&#13;
sequence, despite the fact that there was substantial immigration from&#13;
rural areas, and increasing open urban employment, the real wage rose&#13;
rapiciL,-.  If one takes data from the Social Insurance statistics (which&#13;
gives only that portion of wages covered by social insurance, but which is&#13;
fairly representative for Turkey) on nominal wages, and deflates them&#13;
by the Turkish price index of industrial products, the resulting estimate&#13;
of daily real wages rises from 16.24 TL in 1963 to 35.55 TL at 1963 prices&#13;
in 1976. This represents an average annual rate of increase in the real&#13;
wage of over 6 percent annually.2&#13;
1. Some of the pressure on the labor market was deflected by the demand for&#13;
Turkish workers in Germany and some other EEC countries. Howqever, Turkey&#13;
regulated the outflow of workers, and there was always considerable excess&#13;
demand to migrate to Germany. At its maximum, the percentage of workers abroad&#13;
was about 5 percent of the labor force.&#13;
2. There is no basis to believe that the average skill level of the indus-&#13;
trial labor force increased over the interval. All factory workers in Turkey&#13;
have a primary education, and few have any more. To be sure, experience of&#13;
the labor force may have increased, but that is probably offset by the fact&#13;
that the wages reported above are daily, and hours of work may have decreased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Simultaneously, several forces were operating on the costs of hiring&#13;
the services of capital. On one hand, some capital goods began to be pro-&#13;
duced domestically during the 1963-76 period. To that extent, the price of&#13;
capital goods probably rose for all potential purchasers. The real effective&#13;
exchange rate applicable to capital goods imports, however, probably fell&#13;
somewhat over the period, as tariff duties on imported capital goods were&#13;
first postponed and later completely suspended. While these factors may&#13;
have been offsetting, the most significant influence on the cost of using&#13;
capital undoubtedly arose not from the price of capital goods, but from&#13;
the interest rate at which capital goods purchases were financed. There&#13;
has been credit rationing in Turkey throughout the period under review;&#13;
interest rates have been held at artificially low levels, and credit has&#13;
been channeled toward the manufacturing sector at these low rates. In&#13;
general, the real rate of interest paid by firms was low in the early&#13;
1960s, probably close to zero in the mid-1960s, and then became negative&#13;
in the 1970s as the inflation rate rose much more sharply than did interest&#13;
rates.&#13;
Because different firms and industries were able to finance different&#13;
fractions of their machinery, equipment, and construction expenditures&#13;
by borrowing (and purchased different proportions of their capital goods&#13;
from abroad), it is not possible to provide precise estLimates as to the&#13;
trend in the cost of employing capital services.   However, it seems certain&#13;
that the real interest rate's sharp decline dominated other trends, and&#13;
that the cost of employing capital goods decreased somewhat over the 1963-76&#13;
period, at least for firms with access to domestic credit. M4ost import sub-&#13;
stitution firms, were, of course, in that pOSitiOn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Combining knowvledge that the real wages rose with the fact that borrow-&#13;
ing costs fell over the period on which we are focusing, suggests that pri-&#13;
vate entrepreneurs, at least, had significant incentives to resort to&#13;
increasingly capital-intensive techniques in the period under review. As&#13;
will be seen below, much of the capital accumulation in Turkish manufacturing&#13;
industries appears to have been designed to substitute for labor.&#13;
II.  MEASUREMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF TFPG&#13;
Estimates of TFPG are designed to provide an indication of the change&#13;
in output per unit of input. If output were homogeneous and there were&#13;
only a single homogeneous input (e.g., labor), estimation would be straiglht-&#13;
forward. The rate of growth of factor productivity would be the rate of&#13;
growth of output less the rate of growth of the input. That rate of FPG&#13;
would then indicate the rate at wqhich the real return to the single factor&#13;
(measured in terms of the single commodity) could grow.&#13;
An estimate of TFPG in the multi-factor, multi-commodity case provides&#13;
much the same sort of information. Although estimates of labor productivity&#13;
growth are useful, they fail to distinguish increases in output per worker&#13;
that arise from more inputs of other factors per worker from increases re-&#13;
sulting from improved efficiency, or technical progress. To make such a&#13;
distinction, TFPG is defined as the difference .between the rates of growth&#13;
of output and the rata of growth of inputs, appropriately weighted.   As always,&#13;
whenever weighting is involved, index number questions arise.&#13;
In this section, we first address the question of appropriate weighting&#13;
procedures for inputs. Next, the relationship between output growth rates&#13;
Lor individual industries and for economy-wide aggregates is considered.    Ln&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
light of that discussion, the interpretation of TFPG measures is considered,&#13;
and available estimates of TFPG growth rates for individual manufacturing&#13;
sectors in developed countries and for manufacturing sectors as a whole&#13;
in developing countries are briefly reviewed.&#13;
Weighting Inputs&#13;
Consider first the case of a single homogeneous output produced with&#13;
several inputs, subject to a production function of the form:&#13;
(1)       Xt = Atf (V1, ...    ..., V)&#13;
where Xt is output at time t, and the Vs denote the various factor inputs.&#13;
There has been considerable debate over whether a full accounting of all&#13;
inputs (in terms of both quantity and quality) would permit changes in&#13;
outputs over time to be fully explained. If so, then the change in output&#13;
could be written simply as the sum of changes in inputs times their respec-&#13;
tive partial derivatives of the production function, as the "A" term would&#13;
be a constant.&#13;
Alternacivrely, one can regard the A term as representing the "state&#13;
of the art" at time t.  In that form, At can be formally regarded as Hicks-&#13;
neutral technical change. Total factor productivity growth can then be&#13;
measured as:&#13;
dAt   d      dV1             dV.            dV&#13;
(2)                          - a -a                _&#13;
At    X    'V1       *      i  V '"   '    mVm&#13;
where the as are the elasticities of output with respect to the factors&#13;
denoted by the subscript and sum to unity.   If the elasticity of output&#13;
with respect to each input is constant over a considerable range, the under-&#13;
production function must be of Cobb-Douglas form.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
It is in the form of Equation (2) that estimates of TFPG are usually&#13;
made (see Nishimizu). WThen observations are gathered on rates of increase&#13;
of outputs and inputs and on factor shares, the resulting estimate of TFPG,&#13;
equal to dA/A, is derived directly. An important empirical problem is that,&#13;
as derived, dA!A is a residual, thereby rendering estimates sensitive to&#13;
errors of measurement in inputs and outputs (and factor shares).&#13;
In the short run, in a competitive environment where factors are paid&#13;
the value of their marginal products, the elasticity of output with respect&#13;
to a factor input is equal to the factor's share in the value of output. 1&#13;
The methodology for measuring total factor productivity growth has conse-&#13;
quently been to estimate the growth rate cf output less the weighted average&#13;
rate of growth of identified inputs, where the weights are the shares of&#13;
each factor in the value of total output. 2, 3&#13;
1. There are important questions about the treatment of indirect taxes in&#13;
the value of output. These are discussed in Section III.&#13;
2.  When shares change over time, using a Divisia index for estimating aggre-&#13;
gate inputs is ideal, as Nishimizu shows. We did not follow that procedure,&#13;
for reasons outlined below.&#13;
3. If firms do not face competitive factor markets (either because of a monopoly&#13;
return to capital or through monopsony power in the labor market), use of the&#13;
dA/A measure is biased.   Consider, for example, a Cobb-Douglas function,&#13;
a', 1-a                a'-1  1-a~                     a-aas&#13;
X  A   L K        If W = Xa At L    K    and r     (l-a) A   L K  , with X &lt;&#13;
&gt; 1, then using labor and capital shares will yield an estimate of TFPG,&#13;
dA, of                       dA = dX       dL            dK&#13;
A                            A&#13;
dA -      a     (1-A) L - (1-a) (1-) dK.  If X &gt; 1 and R &lt; 1, the first term is&#13;
A  A            L                 K&#13;
negative and the second positive, and vice versa for X &lt; 1 and &lt; &gt; 1. We use&#13;
this result below in interpreting TFPG estimates for SEEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Aggregating Outputs&#13;
Indices of real output (GNP, manufacturing real output, etc.,) have&#13;
been employed in estimating TFPG for the sector or economy under observation.&#13;
That procedure is followed here, for two-digit -anufacturing industries,&#13;
and for the entire Turkish manufacturing sector.&#13;
A relatively little-explored question pertains to the relationship&#13;
between TFPG rates in firms, industries, sectors, and economy-wide. Nishimizu&#13;
has already explored the relationship between rates of TFPG for real value&#13;
added and real output. In particular, she has shown that the economy-wide&#13;
rate of TFPG of real output will equal the rate of growth of real value&#13;
added times the ratio of output to value added. That is, there is a&#13;
7'multiplier"-term on increases in factor productivity in that productivity&#13;
increases in a supplying sector reduce the resources necessary to produce&#13;
a unit of final output in the receiving sector.   Thus, one must take care&#13;
to insure that estimated rates of TFPG are comparable, i.e., either in&#13;
output terms or in value added terms.&#13;
There are also important questions about links between economy-wide&#13;
rates of growth of factor productivity, and the behavior of individual&#13;
sectors. Consider, for example, a dual economy with an urban sector pro-&#13;
ducing manufactured goods and a rural sector producing food. Assume that&#13;
total factor productivity within each sector is constant over time, but&#13;
that output per unit of input is significantly higher in the urban than in&#13;
the rural sector. In such a circumstance, there will be zero TFPG for&#13;
each sector considered individually. If, however, resources are flowing&#13;
from rural to urban areas, the economy-wide rate of TFPG will be positive&#13;
as a consequence of the intersectoral shift.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
As this simple example shows, the economy-wide rate of TFPG is nct a&#13;
simple weighted average of sector, or industry rates, unless all sectors&#13;
and industries are equally productive in uses of inputs per unit of output&#13;
over the period of observation. Insofar as resources can be shifted from&#13;
less to more productive uses, there will be two sources of TFPG: that&#13;
observed within individual sectors and industries, and that achieved by&#13;
reallocating resources to sectors with above-average productivity.&#13;
What do TFPG Estimates Tell Us?&#13;
As mentioned above, in a single-commodity, single-factor economy,&#13;
the rate of TFPG is also the rate at which real returns to tne factor of&#13;
production can increase. In that context, the importance of TFPG is&#13;
evident. The significant question is how such a notion generalizes to&#13;
1) the multi-factor case; and 2) the interpretation of rates of TFPG for&#13;
individual industries.&#13;
Consider first the multi-factor case, with a single output. In that&#13;
circumstance, the rate of TFPG is the rate at which real incomes to all&#13;
factors of production can increase, consistent with unchanged factor shares.&#13;
A higher rate of TFPG is consistent with higher attainable growth rate of&#13;
real incomes for all factors of production.&#13;
Next assume a country producing many commodities with a single factor&#13;
of production, confronted by given world prices for all its produced goods.&#13;
In that circumstance, the rate of TFPG in each industry indicates the rate&#13;
at which real income to the single factor of production can increase in that&#13;
1. See Robinson for an estimate of the importance of intersectoral shifts&#13;
as a source of growth in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
industry.  If the single factor of production is perfectly mobile between&#13;
industries, one would expect that factors would rapidly shift out of&#13;
industries experiencing below-average rates of productivity growth (at&#13;
constant world prices) and into the industries with high rates.   Indeed,&#13;
carrying the assumption of constant world prices to its logical conclusion,&#13;
if one industry's rate of productivity growth were more rapid than any&#13;
others, one would expect all resources eventually to be allocated to that&#13;
industry, in which case real incomes would be able to grow at the rate of&#13;
growth of productivity of that industry.&#13;
Finally, consider the case in which world prices of all commodities&#13;
are given, but there are many outputs and several factors of production.&#13;
If TFPG rates were the same in all industries, with factors receiving&#13;
equal rewards in all occupations initially, the rate of TFPG would indicate&#13;
the rate at which real incomes could increase. Suppose, instead, that some&#13;
industries increase productivity more rapidly than others. If real returns&#13;
to factors remain equal across all industries, the industries with rapidly&#13;
rising productivity would expand, as the rate of increase of real factor&#13;
returns would fall short of their TFPG rates; industries with below-average&#13;
rates of TFPG would experience contraction. Stated another way, the economy-&#13;
wide rate of TFPG provides an indication of the rate at which real factor&#13;
return's can grow; the rate of TFPG in individual sectors, relative to that&#13;
economy-wide rate, indicates what is happening to the competitive position&#13;
of an individual industry given those world prices. Thus, an industry&#13;
experiencing a rate of TFPG equal to the economy-wide average would find&#13;
its competitive position unchanged as it increased payment to factors of&#13;
production within the industry at the average rate. It would have no&#13;
incentive either to expand or to contract production.'&#13;
1. The statement needs qualification insofar as relative factor prices are&#13;
changing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Thus far, nothing has been said about changes in the qualities of&#13;
factors of production. There is considerable evidence that a major&#13;
contributor to increases in output per unit of input (quality-unadjusted)&#13;
in the now-developed countries has resulted from increasing the quality of&#13;
the labor force. Consideration of TFPG in the developed countries has&#13;
attempted to measure the importance of quality improvements in factors of&#13;
production alongside quantitative increases in physical capital and other&#13;
inputs.&#13;
Such a procedure could be followed in developing countries as well.&#13;
However, to do so would require an altered interpretation of TFPG rates.&#13;
For, to the extent that the labor force increases its skills over time, real&#13;
wages can increase commensurate with the increase in efficiency units. If&#13;
the increase in skills is counted as an increase in the quantity of input,&#13;
then the natural interpretation of TFPG is lost.&#13;
Ideally, one could proceed to estimate TFPG as a function of quantities&#13;
of labor, capital, and other inputs only and then later to divide the&#13;
resulting estimate into components attributable to improved qualities of&#13;
factors of production, transfer of resources from less to more productive&#13;
sectors, and so on.&#13;
In this paper, TFPG is estimated as a function only of quantities of&#13;
inputs, and no quality adjustments are made. This is due to the unavaila-&#13;
bility of data with which to make such adjustments.&#13;
One other aspect of TFPG measurement deserves special notice, in part&#13;
because it plays a major role in our results below. Rates of total factor&#13;
productivity growth provide no clue as to absolute levels of efficiency.&#13;
Thus, the fact that TFPG is higher in one industry than another can, in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
straightforward way, be interpreted to mean that profitability is growing&#13;
more rapidly (or tllat losses are shrinking) in the former if world prices&#13;
(and the country's structure of protection) are constant. It cannot,&#13;
however, be used as an indication that efficiency, in the sense of total&#13;
use of inputs, is higher in the first industry than in the second. As&#13;
we discuss elsewhere (Krueger and Tuncer), one can in some circumstances&#13;
(such as the infant industry argument) use observations on TFPG rates to&#13;
reject certain types of hypotheses about the relative performance of&#13;
various sectors over time, but rates of TFPG can never confirm hypotheses&#13;
with respect to efficiency. As will be seen below, this shortcoming of&#13;
the measure proved initially to be particularly troublesome in understanding&#13;
our results with respect to public and private sector behavior in Turkey.&#13;
Estimates of TFPG Rates for Other Countries&#13;
Few estimates of rates of TFPG are available for developing countries,&#13;
and those that there are are normally economy-wide.    For the manufacturing&#13;
sector, there are even fewer estimates, and those that there are were under-&#13;
taken with differing methodologies, different definitions of the scope of&#13;
manufacturing, and cover manufacturing, however defined, only in the aggregate.&#13;
Chen estimated rate of manufacturing TFPG for Hong Kong, South Korea and&#13;
Taiwan for the period 1960-70 and for Singapore for 1957-70. He estimated&#13;
that the annual rate of manufacturing TFPG was 2.29 percent in Hong Kong,&#13;
3.75 percent in Singapore, 3.47 percent in South Korea and 3.59 percent in&#13;
Taiwan. Other available estimates include one for the Philippines for the&#13;
1. See Robinson for one attempt to estimate sources of growth in developing&#13;
countries. Robinson considers capital accumulation, labor growth, the transfer&#13;
of factors between sectors, and the availability of foreign exchange.&#13;
2. See the manuscript of Kelley and Williamson for a survey of such estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
short period 1965-69 of 1.89 percent by Ezaki, and an estimated rate of&#13;
4.00 percent by Lianos for Greece for 1958-68.&#13;
In some regards, all these estimates are surprising low, in that&#13;
estimated rates for the developed countries are generally as high if not&#13;
higher. Thus, estimated rates of manufacturing TFPG are 3.5 percent for&#13;
Norway (Ringstad); 3.66 percent for Japan (Hulten and Nishimizu), in excess&#13;
of 3.75 for Italy (Conti and Filosa) and 2.1 percent for the United States&#13;
(Kendrick).&#13;
When. it comes to estimated rates of TFPG for individual two-digit&#13;
manufacturing industries, the available data are even sparser. To our&#13;
knowledge, there are no estimates available on a two-digit basis for&#13;
developing countries. For developed countries, the best available set is&#13;
probably that of Ringstad for Norway. Although he found substantial evi-&#13;
dence of non-neutral technical change in some industries, he also presented&#13;
estimates of rates of shift of Cobb-Douglas production functions for most&#13;
two-digit industries (Ringstad, p. 139). Estimated rates of neutral techni-&#13;
cal change ranged from a negative 1.8 percent for printing and publishing&#13;
(the only negative observation) to 9.7 percent for miscellaneous manu-&#13;
facturing, with an average over all manufacturing industries of 3.5 percent.&#13;
Rates below two percent were recorded only for clothing, mineral products&#13;
and transport equipment (in addition to printing and publishing).&#13;
If rates of TFPG in developed countries' manufacturing sectors have&#13;
been in excess of two-three percent, it would suggest that any developing&#13;
country failing to achieve TFPG rates in excess of that range in its manu-&#13;
facturing sector would not be able both to maintain its competitive position&#13;
in its existing manufacturing industries and increase real factor incomes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
at a rate equal to the rate of TFPG. As will be seen, estimates for&#13;
Turkish manufacturing industry fall below the two percent level, a subject&#13;
that deserves further consideration after presentation of the estimates.&#13;
III. RATES OF TFPG IN TURKISH MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES&#13;
Sources and Methods&#13;
Details of the data and of procedures used to obtain the needed time&#13;
series - output, labor, capital and material inputs, and -factor shares,&#13;
are given in Appendix A and only a brief overview is given here.&#13;
Our data include: physical capital stock, number of workers, purchased&#13;
inputs, nominal value of output, and appropriate sector-specific price de-&#13;
flators for output and purchased inputs. Data were also available for&#13;
wage payments. Combining them with the value of purchased inputs, the&#13;
return to capital was estimated as a residual. There were no data available&#13;
with which to adjust for indirect tax payments.    While there are always&#13;
some data problems, checks of the data set for consistency and "reasonable-&#13;
ness" were highly satisfactory.&#13;
Essentially, for the period 1963-76, rates of TFPG were estimated based&#13;
upon regression equation estimates of (logarithmic) time trends for outputs&#13;
and inputs, and on average shares of three factors of production (capital,&#13;
labor, and purchased inputs). Use of time trends smoothed a great deal of&#13;
1.  See Appendix A for an estimate of the sensitivity of our results to the&#13;
failure to adjust for taxes. Essentially, the bias in our TFPG estimates&#13;
is downward, but must be less than .1 percent, given the range of tax rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
year-to-year variation in our data, and average shares were used for the&#13;
same reason: year-to-year observations fluctuated over extremely wide&#13;
ranges.&#13;
The fourteen year period covered by our estimates roughly corresponds&#13;
to the first three Five Year Developmant Plans, and thus to the period&#13;
of'planned development" of the Turkish economy. As already mentioned,&#13;
Turkish economic growth slowed drastically after 1976.&#13;
We also estimated rates of TFPG for the subperiods of interest because&#13;
of fluctuations in the trade regime. For those estimates, initial and&#13;
terminal year observations were employed to derive time trends, and the&#13;
average of the factor shares in the first year and last year of the period&#13;
under consideration was used. Finally, three-year moving averages of outputs,&#13;
inputs, and factor shares were computed, and employed as a further means&#13;
of analyzing behavior over time.&#13;
Data cover each two-digit manufacturiuig industry in Turkey except for&#13;
printing and publishing and miscellaneous manufacturing. The coverage is&#13;
for all firms with ten or more employees.   The printing and publishing and&#13;
miscelldneous manufacturing sectors were omitted for lack of a suitable&#13;
1. Appendix A provides some evidence that alternative specifications of&#13;
shares would not greatly affect the private sector results. For the public&#13;
sector, the labor share increased much more rapidly. Estimates of the effects&#13;
of using alternative estimates of shares are given in Section IV.&#13;
2. See Appendix A for data on the share of firms with less than ten employees&#13;

price deflator for their output. Since the State Institute of Statistics&#13;
collects data on public and private firms within each two-digit industry,&#13;
rates of TFPG were estimated separately for public and private sectors of&#13;
each industry, and also for the industry as a whole.1&#13;
Table 2 gives data on the characteristics of each two-digit manufact-&#13;
uring industry covered by the estimates (which include all two-digit manu-&#13;
facturing industries except for printing and publishing and miscellaneous&#13;
manufacturing for which no appropriate price deflators were available).&#13;
The first three columns give the labor, purchased input, and capital (defined&#13;
as the residual) shares of manufacturing output in 1968. The fourth and&#13;
fifth columns give the shares of labor and capital in value added. As can&#13;
be seen, labor, capital, and materials shares vary widely across industries.&#13;
The sixth column of Table 2 gives the share of 1968 manufacturing output&#13;
(public and private sector together) originating in finns with more than&#13;
ten employees in each two-digit industry. As can be seen, food processing,&#13;
tobacco, textiles, and petroleum and coal were the largest sectors in termis&#13;
2.&#13;
of value of output.   By contrast, the industries with the most rapid rates&#13;
of growth over the period were wearing apparel and footwear (probably re-&#13;
sulting from a growing number of firms passing the ten-employee threshold),&#13;
rubber products, chemicals, petroleum and coal, machinery (both electrical&#13;
and nonelectrical), and transport equipment. With the exception of wearing&#13;
1. Because public and private shares of labor, capital, and materials&#13;
differ, it occasionally happened that the observed rate of TFPG for the&#13;
entire sector lay outside the range for each component.&#13;
2. Exclusion of firms employing less than ten workers accounts for the&#13;
small share of apparel and footwear.&#13;

apparel and footwear, these industries (plus paper and products) have con-&#13;
stituted the main import-substitution sectors within Turkish manufacturing,&#13;
and have had high rates of effective protection, as discussed above.&#13;
The final columns of Table 2 give the estimated growth rates of labor&#13;
and capital inputs and output for each sector for the 1963-76 period. As&#13;
can be seen, for the large-scale manufacturing sector as a whole, output&#13;
grew at a continuous annual rate of 12.2 percent, while capital inputs&#13;
grew 12.8 percent and the number of employees at an annual rate of 6.3&#13;
percent. Thus, capital inputs grew roughly twice as rapidly as labor inputs.&#13;
This held in the aggregate, and for every sector considered individually&#13;
except for wearing appa el and footwear. While not definitive, these rela-&#13;
tive rates of increase, combined with knowledge that the real relative&#13;
cost of hiring labor was rising fairly rapidly, strongly suggests that&#13;
much Turkish investment in the manufacturing sector was devoted to sub-&#13;
stitution of capital for labor, rather than to expanding capacity.&#13;
Rates of TFPG&#13;
Table 3 gives estimated rates of TFPG for the two-digit industries indicated.&#13;
The numbers correspond to continuous annual rates as computed from regressed&#13;
time trends,while those in parentheses indicate the estimates that result from&#13;
using an average of the first two years and of the last two years as a basis&#13;
1&#13;
for estimating growth rates of inputs and outputs.&#13;
As can be seen, the overall rate of TFPG for Turkish manufacturing has&#13;
been a relatively low 2.10 percent, taking the trend line as best estimate.&#13;
This does not auger well for "closing the gap," when contrasted with the&#13;
1. Estimates based upon single and terminal years were even more volatile&#13;
than the two-year rates, but deviations from the trend rates were in the&#13;
same direction as the two-year based rates in all cases.&#13;

Note: All rates are continuous. Figures in parentheses are the rates com-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
rates of TFPG for other developing and developed countries reported in&#13;
Section II.&#13;
There is some variation in the estimates depending upon whether&#13;
trend rates or actual averages of the first two years and last two years&#13;
are used. Nonetheless, the correlation between them is fairly substantial.&#13;
Disparities of more than one percentage point are found only for public&#13;
beverages, private rubber products, private petroleum and coal (which, as&#13;
can be seen by examining the total column, is a relatively small component&#13;
of the sector and consists mostly of small firms fabricating coal products;&#13;
there is above-average reason to suspect that use of the same price index&#13;
as a deflator for public and private Lutput is especially unfortunate in&#13;
this sector), public machinery, public electrical machinery, and private&#13;
transport equipment. In no sector is the differential as large as two&#13;
percentage points.&#13;
In general, there does not appear to be any pronounced tendency for&#13;
import-substitution firms to have increased their output per unit of input&#13;
more rapidly than firms in more traditional sectors, such as wearing apparel&#13;
and footwear. While rubber products and metal products both show rates in&#13;
excess of two percent, basic metals shows a rate of TFPG of only .61 percent,&#13;
and paper and products only .50 percent.    Rubber products was a sector&#13;
in which tire manufacturing (as an import substitution activity) started in&#13;
1963 and 1964, with rapid increases in output starting only in 1965. The&#13;
high rate of TFPG for that sector may therefore in part reflect simply a&#13;
1. The public sector component of petroleum and coal products is dominated&#13;
by petroleum refining, which was also a major thrust of import substitution&#13;
policy. The rate of TFPG in that sector is also very low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
timing phenomenon (as is partially reflected in the higher terminal estimate&#13;
than in the trend-rate estimate).&#13;
It would be of great interest to examine estimated rates of TFPG for&#13;
other developing countries to find out if there is a standard, or normal,&#13;
profile of rates against which the estimates for Turkey could be judged.&#13;
Until a great deal more work is done, however, it will be difficult to&#13;
evaluate profiles of TFPG across industries within a country. In part,&#13;
this pinpoints a major difficulty of TFPG estimates: they are indicative&#13;
of rates of increase of output per unit of input (either because of quality&#13;
improvements of inputs or for other reasons), but they give no indication&#13;
as to the efficiency level. Thus, it is a plausible hypothesis that firms&#13;
with low rates of TFPG are those that are already efficient; it is at least&#13;
equally plausible that firms with high rates of TFPG are now efficient.&#13;
Further evidence with regard to the efficiency level issue is provided&#13;
below in evaluating the performance of public and private sector firms&#13;
within individual industries.&#13;
Variations over Time in TFPG Rates&#13;
As already indicated, the continued drive toward import substitution&#13;
and evident increasing costs of restrictive trade regimes led us to believe&#13;
that there would be something of a tendency for a secular decline in rates&#13;
of TFPG, and also that there would be fluctuations between subperiods re-&#13;
flecting inefficiencies associated with difficulties and delays in obtaining&#13;
imported raw materials, intermediate goods, and spare parts. To investigate&#13;
this, TFPG rates were estimated for four subperiods: 1963-67, 1967-70,&#13;
1970-73 and 1973-76.   Because of the shortness of the intervals, estimates&#13;
are necessarily based on first year-last year rates and are thus more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
volatile with respect to year-to-year fluctuations in outputs and inputs.&#13;
The resulting estimates are given in Table 4.&#13;
As is immediately evident, there has been something of a secular de-&#13;
cline in the average rate of TFPG across all industries, although the fortunes&#13;
of individual industries have varied. For all large-scale manufacturing,&#13;
the rate of TFPG is estimated to have been 3.2 percent annually over the&#13;
1963-67 period, to have fallen to 1.31 percent annually from 1967 to 1970,&#13;
risen to 2.51 percent over the 1970-73 period, and then fallen to -1.18&#13;
percent for 1973-76. Thus, even the average rate of 'TFPG of 2.1 percent&#13;
per annum is based largely on the relatively good performance of the mid-&#13;
1960s.  In the "sources of growth" context, only about 17 percent of manu-&#13;
facturing output growth is residual: 83 percent of manufacturing output&#13;
growth is "explained" by increases in inputs into the sector. Moreover,&#13;
the proportionate residual became smaller as time wore on.&#13;
The overall rate of TFPG for the individual subperiods also provides&#13;
some support for our hypothesis that periods of import stringency (1967-70&#13;
and 1973-76) would be associated with lower rates of TFPG. The rate fell&#13;
by more than half from 1963-67 to 1967-70, and it went from positive to&#13;
negative from 1970-73 to 1973-76.&#13;
If attention turns to individual industries, the picture is far less&#13;
clear. For the 1967-70 period, rates of TFPG were generally below those&#13;
of the preceding period, and there is some tendency for rates to have&#13;
fallen more drastically in the import-dependent industries (rubber products,&#13;
1. As already mentioned, in light of subsequent events in Turkey, with rising&#13;
rates of inflation, increased foreign exchange stringency, and other economic&#13;
difficulties, there is every reason to believe that data for the 1976-79 period&#13;
would show continued deterioration in rates of TFPG.&#13;

petroleum and coal, metal products, and transport equipment) than in&#13;
some of the more traditional industries. The same pattern reappears, but&#13;
not in quite as pronounced form, for the 1973-76 period. In that period&#13;
some of the more traditional industries appear also to have experienced&#13;
dimunition in TFPG rates: textiles, wearing apparel and nonmetallic&#13;
minerals are notable in that regard.&#13;
To further inveÂ§tigate the hypothesis that there were marked differences&#13;
in subperiods, we calculated three-year moving averages of inputs, outputs,&#13;
and factor shares. We then calculated rates of TFPG between pairs of&#13;
calculations. The results for a number of industries are reported in&#13;
Table 5.   The growth rate indicated for food products for the period&#13;
1963-66, for example, is the rate of growth of TFPG calculated by taking&#13;
the average values for 1963-65 and 1964-66 and estimating the growth rate&#13;
between them. While there is some tendency for retardation of TFPG rates&#13;
in the late 1960s, it is not as uniform as we expected, although there is a&#13;
pronounced downward trend in the estimate for all manufacturing. What does&#13;
emerge clearly again is the sharp deterioration in rates of TFPG in most&#13;
industries in the period after about 1973. Paper and paper products (whose&#13;
productivity is estimated not to have reattained the level of 1967 until&#13;
about 1975), rubber products, metal products, machinery, and electrical&#13;
machinery do not share the strong downward trend.&#13;
While there are too few observations and too much variability across&#13;
industries to draw firm conclusions with regard to the individual subperiods,&#13;
it nonetheless seems warranted to conclude that, not only was the average&#13;
rate of TFPG low for Turkish large-scale manufacturing over the 1963-76&#13;
1. Tobacco, wood and cork products, and furniture and fixtures are omitted&#13;
largely because those sectors rely heavily on domestic rawv materials.&#13;

period, but there was a tendency for that rate to diminish. Obviously,&#13;
these conclusions raise more questions than can immediately be answered,&#13;
but that in itself does not diminish the importance of the finding.&#13;
IV. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS&#13;
One of the surprising results of our estimates was that they showed&#13;
that public sector enterprises had higher rates of TFPG on average than had&#13;
their private counterparts. To be sure, some of this finding was attribu-&#13;
table to different weights attaching to different two-digit industries:&#13;
tobacco, for example, has a much higher weight in the public sector than&#13;
in the private sector and its hign rate of TFPG raises the public sector&#13;
average relative to the private sector by more than the differential in&#13;
TFPG rates. Likewise, the estimated large negative TFPG for petroleum and&#13;
coal may have been due in part to different product mixes in the two sectors&#13;
with different price behavior which was not captured by our use of a single&#13;
index. Nonetheless, the finding that public sector enterprises had more&#13;
rapid productivity growth than private firms remained puzzling. Our inter-&#13;
pretation of this result is of interest in its own right, and also illus-&#13;
trates both the uses and the limitations of analyzing rates of TFPG.&#13;
A first line of inquiry was whether there was any basis to believe that&#13;
prices confronting public sector firms had risen systematically more slowly&#13;
than those confronting private firms in the same industry. This would, of&#13;
course, have biased estimates of private sector output growth rates down-&#13;
ward and those of the public sector upward.   However, there is no evidence&#13;
of this sort of phenomenon. Likewise, there is no reason to believe that&#13;
there is any systematic difference in ways of estimating capital stock&#13;
growÂ¢th.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
A next question was whether public sector enterprises' outputs were&#13;
so different from their private-sector counterparts within individual&#13;
industries as to invalidate the assumption of a common price index.&#13;
Although, as already mentioned, there is some basis for believing that&#13;
this might be the case in petroleum and coal products (and also for beverages&#13;
and tobacco), there is no basis for such a belief in such sectors as textiles&#13;
and basic metals, and even then one would have to explain wqhy the deviations&#13;
appeared systematically in the way that they did.&#13;
Next, it is widely known that public enterprises were constrained to&#13;
hire more labor than was probably optimal from a viewpoint of produccive&#13;
efficiency. Using shares of expenses in the public sector was therefore&#13;
probably a biased procedure. To test the importance of this possible source&#13;
of bias, rates of TFPG were reestimated for public sector industries using&#13;
the shares of the private sector counterparts, on the rationale that those&#13;
-hares might more appropriately represent the outcome of cost-minimizing&#13;
behavior. The TFPG rates so computed, contrasted with the ones given in&#13;
Table 3 above are:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
As can be seen, there are differences in shares between public and&#13;
private sectors, and they do significantly affect estimates of public sector&#13;
TFPG growth. Especially for food processing, paper and products, machinery&#13;
(both electrical and nonelectrical) and transport equipment, use of private&#13;
sector shares significantly lowers the estimate of TFPG. However, in other&#13;
sectors, use of private sector shares raises it. This is because of the&#13;
fact that the capital share is usually given a higher weight in the private&#13;
sector, and capital was the more rapidly growing factor in those sectors.&#13;
In other sectors, however, the opposite result holds, as either the lower&#13;
weight attached to the growth of labor, or a changed weight on materials&#13;
inputs, outweighs whatever estimated reduction there is in TFPG. For the&#13;
manufacuring SEEs as a whole, use of private sector weights actually increases&#13;
the estimated rate of TFPG by two-tenths of one percent.&#13;
This exercise, however, pointed up another line of inquiry. If public&#13;
firms are earning less profit per dollar of output than private firms and&#13;
are implicitly subsidized in their costs of inputs (through subsidized&#13;
credit, failure to pay import duties and so on), then the costs in the&#13;
public and private sector are not comparable. It is possible directly to&#13;
estimate inputs per unit of output in the public and private sector, given&#13;
the availability of estimates of capital stock and number of employees.&#13;
The final step was to consider what the case would be if public sector&#13;
firms were indeed selling at a price below their economic costs and, in&#13;
particular, if input prices were subsidized. If public and private sector&#13;
firms within the same two-digit industry were using similar inputs, priced&#13;
differently, it is possible to estimate efficiency levels.&#13;
In particular, we examined :arefully the structure of inputs in the&#13;
public and private sectors, industry by industry.   It turned outt that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
in almost all cases, capital and labor per unit of sales price were sub-&#13;
stantially greater in the public sector than in the private, while raw&#13;
material costs per unit of sale price were substantially lowqer.   Indeed,&#13;
for manufacturing as a whole, in 1963, the public sector firms paid 59.7&#13;
liras on purchased inputs per 100 TL of sales, while private firms paid&#13;
72.0 liras per 100 TL of sales. For some subsectors, the discrepancy was&#13;
even more pronounced: for wearing apparel, SEEs paid 45.4 of TL and pri-&#13;
vate firms 68.8 per 100 TL of sales.&#13;
It seems plausible to believe that SEEs are not likely to use less&#13;
cloth per dress, or leather per pair of shoes than the private sector, while&#13;
simultaneously using more labor and capital, at least to the degree reported.&#13;
If anything, there is probably more vertical integration in the private&#13;
sector than in the public in comparable industries. It therefore seems&#13;
reasonable to assume that the true use of materials per unit of sales was&#13;
the same in both public and private sectors, industry by industry.    If&#13;
that assumption is accepted, it is possible to compute factor use per unit&#13;
of output in the public sector, relative to the private sector, and thus to&#13;
estimate differences in "efficiency." The estimates are presented in Table 6.&#13;
The ratio of capital input per unit of output in the public sector to that&#13;
in the private sector is given in column (1) for 1963, while that for 1976&#13;
1.  Recall that the unit of measure for labor was number of workers, while&#13;
that for capital is an estimate of the constant-price value of machinery,&#13;
equipment, buildings and so on.&#13;
2. That selling prices of outputs of public and private sector enterprises&#13;
must be much the same follows from the fact that the goods are competitive&#13;
in the market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
is given in column (4). For paper and products, for example, the SEEs&#13;
in the sector used just over twice as much capital per unit of output as the&#13;
private sector in 1963, and their capital utilization had increased slightly&#13;
more than that of the private sector by 1976. Meanwhile, in 1963, labor&#13;
utilization per unit of output in the public sector was slightly less,&#13;
while by 1976, public sector firms employed 1.31 times as many workers per&#13;
unit of output as did private firms.&#13;
To estimate the average efficiency of the public sector relative to&#13;
the private sector, the private-sector shares of value added for the years&#13;
in question were used, For paper and products, for example, the private&#13;
sector's labor share was 32.4 percent of value added in 1963 and 28.8 per-&#13;
cent of value added in 1976. Those weights were multiplied by labor utili-&#13;
zation ratios, to obtain an "average inefficiency"! measure. Comparison&#13;
of the direction of change of these ratios with the differential in TFPG&#13;
rates reported in Table 3 indicates that, in general, when the private&#13;
sector's TFPG rose more rapidly than the public sector (as with paper&#13;
and products), the measure of inefficiency increases.1&#13;
These estimates must be taken as approximations only. In some sectors,&#13;
as for example petroleum and coal products, the output mix of the public&#13;
and private sectors is so different that it seems evident that the use of&#13;
a common price index probably dominates the results. Interpretation of&#13;
1. There could be divergences between the two because the measure of TFPG&#13;
includes materials utilization. Thus if apparent utilization of materials&#13;
in the public sector rose less rapidly relative to output than in the private&#13;
sector, it is conceivable that the two measures would diverge. This happened,&#13;
for example, with food products, where the fraction of purchased inputs to&#13;
outputs in the public sector rose from .57 to .70 while that in the private&#13;
sector fell from .85 to .82 - apparently more efficient use of inputs accounts&#13;
for the private sector's higher estimated TFPG.&#13;

Because capital stock was presented jointly for textiles and wearing apparel&#13;

the data on beverages and tobacco products is subject to the same difficulty:&#13;
the public sector produces alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, while the&#13;
private sector produces mainly soft drinks and processes tobacco for export.&#13;
According to the estimates in Table 6, there are a number of&#13;
sectors in which public sector firms increased their relative efficiency:&#13;
food processing, textiles and wearing apparel, chemicals, and transport&#13;
equipment. There were also some where the opposite happened, as in wood and&#13;
cork products, nonfmetallic mineral products, basic metals, metal products,.&#13;
machinery, and electrical machinery.&#13;
Leaving aside beverages and tobacco products, where the output mix may&#13;
be different enough to make comparisons less than meaningful, there were two&#13;
public sector industries in 1963 that were apparently more efficient than&#13;
their private counterparts: nonmetallic mineral products, and nonelectrical&#13;
machinery. By 1976, only nonelectrical machinery was apparently more effici-&#13;
ent in the public sector, although the public sector as a whole had reduced&#13;
its relative inefficiency, using about 1.22 times as many resources per unit&#13;
of value added in 1976 (compared with about 1.60 in 1963).&#13;
It is of some interest that, during the 1973-76 period, the private&#13;
sector was engaged in substituting capital for labor as the real wage rose&#13;
(see growth rates of labor, capital, and output in Table 3). In 1963, the&#13;
public sector was employing higher capital-to-labor ratios in every industry&#13;
than their private counterparts except for beverages, tobacco products,&#13;
wood and cork products, and machinery, electrical machinery, and transport&#13;
equipment. On average, however, labor per unit of output was slightly&#13;
less in the public sector than in the private. By 1976, this had re-&#13;
versed; the public sector used about one percent more labor per unit of&#13;
output, and about 43.6 more capital per unit of output than the private sector.&#13;
These computations, which can at best be taken as approximate orders&#13;
of magnitude, nonetheless illustrate several points of significance. First&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
and foremost, it is not inconsistent to believe that the public sector&#13;
had a higher rate of growth of total factor productivity than the private&#13;
sector, and yet was absolutely inefficient. Indeed, our estimates of&#13;
inefficiency accord wi-th widely-held views about the public sector and&#13;
its comparative efficiency in Turkey. Thus, they point to the importance&#13;
of concern with levels of efficiency as much as with growth in factor&#13;
productivity: it is possible that investing in a transfer of resources&#13;
from public to private electrical machinery might have had a far greater&#13;
payoff than an equal investment in raising productivity within the private&#13;
electrical machinery industry. To be sure, if there are policies that simul-&#13;
taneously accomplish both, the payoff may be still greater yet.&#13;
V.   CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Estimates of TFPG for individual industiies, as well as economy-wide,&#13;
are of interest for a number of reasons. On one hand, there are significant&#13;
questions as to what a "normal" pattern of TFPG might be, and whether the&#13;
profile of rates across Turkish two-digit industries is similar to that in&#13;
other countries. Such a question cannot be answered until comparable esti-&#13;
mates are available for a variety of countries. On the other hand, there&#13;
are significant questions as to the determinants of rates of growth of&#13;
output per unit of input.   In the Turkish case- we hypothesized that Turkish&#13;
manufacturing would have experienced an overall slowdown in the rate of TFPG&#13;
as import-substitution policies pushed resources into increasingly inefficient,&#13;
high-cost, protected industries and also that periods of highly restrictive&#13;
exchange controls would have been periods of slower growtlh of factor pro-&#13;
ductivity than periods of relative liberalization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
While our observations have only one degree of freedom, they nonethe-&#13;
less provide some support for the notion that highly restrictive exchange&#13;
control regimes may result in lower rates of increase in output per unit&#13;
of input than more liberalized regimes. Also, there has been a fairly pro-&#13;
nounced tendency in Turkey for the rate of productivity growth to decel-&#13;
erate over the period in question.&#13;
Other important questions remain to be explored. There are interesting&#13;
questions as to the links between the growth of factor productivity in the&#13;
economay as a whole and in individual sectors. Further ahead, there are im-&#13;
portant questions as to the factors influencing rates of TFPG, and policies&#13;
that can (efficiently) accelerate it.&#13;
Finally, useful as estimates of TFPG may be, both in providing an esti-&#13;
mate of "other factors" to be explained by policy variables such as trade&#13;
regimes and domestic incentive systems, they do not permit any analysis of&#13;
absolute levels of efficiency. As illustrated by our efforts to interpret&#13;
data from the public and private sectors, estimation of productivity&#13;
differentials requires a means of estimating production functions, or a proxy&#13;
for them.&#13;

APPENDIX A.&#13;
DATA AND PROCEDURES FOR ESTITMATION&#13;
As examination of Equation (2) indicates, estimates of dA/A are a&#13;
residual, and as such, are extremely sensitive to errors of measurement.&#13;
To be sure, estimating the fraction of output growth attributable to fac-&#13;
tor accumulation is itself of interest, but the residual nature of the&#13;
TFPG estimates still warrants care.&#13;
Basic data at hand covered the period from 1963 to 1976. They origi-&#13;
nated from the Turkish State Institute of Statistics, which publishes both&#13;
a periodic Census of Manufacturing Industries and a yearly Annual Survey&#13;
of Manufacturing Industries. Those publications provide data by industry&#13;
on: value of sales; number of employees; value of purchases of inter-&#13;
mediate goods and raw material inputs; annual exper'ditures on assets for&#13;
plant and equipment; and wage payments. There was also available, from the&#13;
State Planning Organization, a time series on capital stock.2&#13;
1. There is, to be sure, one check: the upper bound rate of TFPG is the&#13;
difference between the rate of growth of output and the most slowly growing&#13;
input while the lower bound is output growth rate less most rapidly growing&#13;
inputs. Also, when errors in estimation of rates of growth of output and&#13;
of inputs are biased in the same direction (or better yet grow in the same&#13;
proportion), the impact on the residual is reduced.&#13;
2. At first, we tried to use the SPO's capital stock figures for 1965&#13;
and then to form our own capital stock estimates by subtracting depreciation&#13;
and adding new assets (after adjusting for price level changes) for later&#13;
years, and reversing the procedure for earlier years. The resulting figures&#13;
yielded implausibly low estimates of the rate of growth of capital stock in&#13;
manufacturing which has been the sector most encouraged by Turkish planners&#13;
and the trade regime. On investigation, it turned out that the Annual Surveys&#13;
cover investments of existing firms but do not record net asset acqtuisition&#13;
by newly-starting firms in years before production begins. Thus, total invest-&#13;
ment in industries is understated. It is perhaps reassuring that we could&#13;
infer what was wrong from the estimates we had.   See below   for an account&#13;
of the procedures we used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-2&#13;
Researchers focusing on other countries will be confronted with a dif-&#13;
ferent set of data and different problems.   Nonetheless, it is instructive&#13;
to record some of the difficulties wve faced and the procedures used to&#13;
resolve them, both to help others avoid some of our mistakes, and to&#13;
permit judgment as to the comparability of our results with those which&#13;
may be forthcoming fromv other countries. This is more conveniently&#13;
accomplished by discussing problems one by one than by describing pro-&#13;
cedures for forming each of the variables on the right hand side of&#13;
Equation (2).&#13;
Deflators for Output and Purchased Inputs&#13;
The SPO capital stock data were already in constant prices and&#13;
1&#13;
therefore needed no adjustment on that account.    For output and purchased&#13;
inputs, however, the data were in nominal terms and deflators were necessary&#13;
in order to adjust for price level changes. For output, this was readily&#13;
accomplished, as the Ministry of Commerce provided price data on a basis&#13;
comparable with the two-digit industries covered by the Census and Annual&#13;
Surveys. That using individual sectoral deflators is important can be&#13;
seen from the consideration that, in Turkey, the range of annual rates of&#13;
1. In attempting to construct our own capital stock series (as reported&#13;
in the preceding footnote), we did have separate "capital goods" price&#13;
deflators, and used them to deflate investment before adding it to the&#13;
(constant price) capital stock.&#13;
2. There were three exceptions. The index for "textiles and wearing apparel"&#13;
was used for both textiles and for wearing apparel and footwear; similarly,&#13;
the same index was used for both the machinery and the transport equipment&#13;
sectors.&#13;
For furniture and fixtures, the clothing and household goods component of&#13;
the Istanbul wage earners' cost of living index was used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-3&#13;
price increase is estimated to have been from 4.8 percent annually (for&#13;
rubber and plastic products) to 12.5 percent annually (for wood and cork&#13;
products). Had, instead, the price index for all manufacturing been&#13;
used, with an annual average rate increase of 9.4 percent, the rate of&#13;
growth of output for wood and cork products would have been overstated&#13;
by 3.46 percent.&#13;
For purchased inputs, choice of deflators was more difficult. At&#13;
first glance, it would appear that one might assign to purchased inputs&#13;
a price index based upon the major supplying sector. That this procedure&#13;
is unsatisfactory can readily be appreciated by noting that an industry&#13;
such as textiles uses both cotton and synthetics as major inputs. The&#13;
price movements of the two are extremely divergent over the period under&#13;
review. Choice of cotton price as a deflator will overestimate the rate&#13;
of growth of purchased inputs (as the price of synthetics rose much more&#13;
rapidly) while choice of synthetics prices would underestimate the rate&#13;
of growth of purchased inputs. The final solution was to use the 1973&#13;
input-output table, applying the weights from that tableI (of purchased&#13;
inputs) to the different price indices (including agricultural and mineral&#13;
commodities as well as other industrial sectors) to yield a composite&#13;
1. The input-output table is at market prices. It does not differentiate&#13;
non-competitive and competitive imports. Presumably, the price index refers&#13;
to the basket of goods, both domestic and imported, of a particular sector.&#13;
When producers received import licenses directly, the price index presumably&#13;
overstates their input cost for imported intermediate goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-4&#13;
index for each manufacturing sector representing its average price of&#13;
purchased inputs.&#13;
W4e could have, as an alternative, estimated TFPG for real value added,&#13;
rather than for output. Initially, we chose output as a base because it&#13;
was clear that the quality of purchased inputs varied with the fraction of&#13;
those inputs which were imported and over time. Analysis of the data&#13;
quickly revealed that there was another, perhaps more compelling, reason.&#13;
That is, much of the development of manufacturing industry in Turkey has&#13;
been a process of vertical integration within firms and industries. The&#13;
development of the textile industry, for example, has taken place in&#13;
1. We are grateful to Yuji Kubo of the World Bank for having the computations&#13;
performed. At a later date, the computations were rerun, using 1963, 1968,&#13;
and 1973 input-output tables and interpolating weights for intervening years.&#13;
Comparison of the constant-weight to interpolated weight estimates revealed&#13;
only very small differences in the indices, and then only for the middle&#13;
years, so that our final estimat2s were not affected for the 1963-76 meriod.&#13;
For only one sector - transport equipment - did any yearly deviation amount&#13;
to five percent, and even that deviation was reduced in subsequent years.&#13;
We therefore did not rerun our results using interpolated indices.&#13;
For researchers interested in how much varying weights affect estimated&#13;
prices, we note the following. There was no change (up to five digits) in&#13;
price indices for food, beverages, tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel&#13;
and footwear, wood products, furniture, and both machinery sectors.&#13;
Naturally, estimates for the years 1963 and 1973 to 1976 were unaltered.&#13;
The ratio of the interpolated to the constant-weight price indices for the&#13;
affected sectors was, for the years indicated:&#13;

large part through the purchase of progressively less processed materials,&#13;
and adding greater value to the raw materials in the domestic industry.&#13;
Output Elasticities&#13;
As indicated above, the value of wage payments and of purchases of raw&#13;
materials and intermediate goods was provided by the State Institute of&#13;
Statistics. Although the value of production taxes (an excise tax ranging&#13;
from 4-20 percent of value added imposed at the factory level) and other&#13;
indirect taxes are included in the value of output, data were not available&#13;
with which to correct for that.    Thus, the residual was used as the share&#13;
of capital for purposes of estimating TFPG. Failure to correct for the&#13;
production tax undoubtedly overestimates the share of capital. Since capital&#13;
was growing more rapidly than labor in most industries, there is something&#13;
of a downward bias in the estimate of TFPG.3&#13;
1. There is a close relationship between value-added and output-based TFPG&#13;
estimates.  As Nishimizu (p. 15) has shown, if Xi = Ait (Li, K.i Mi), (where&#13;
L, K, and M are inputs of labor, capital, and purchased inputs respectively),&#13;
failure to include M in estimating TFPG will result in an upward bias pro-&#13;
portionate to the purchased input share in the value of output. Under the&#13;
alternative specification of the production function (separability between&#13;
primary factors and purchased inputs with technological progress applying&#13;
only to the former), the bias is reversed. In the Turkish case, it seems&#13;
clear that output is the preferable basis for estimation.&#13;
2. The other indirect taxes significantly affecting gross output values&#13;
are important primarily for beverages, tobacco, and petroleum and coal&#13;
products. Fertilizer production (in the chemicals sector, and mostly in&#13;
the public sector),is subsidized.&#13;
3. There is no reason to believe that tax rates changed to any significant&#13;
extent over the 1963-76 period. The bias results from an overstatement&#13;
of the capital share throughout.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-6&#13;
To glean some idea of the importance of the resulting bias, assu-me&#13;
two industries, both with rates of growth of output of 12 percent, of&#13;
capital stock of ten percent, of labor of five percent, and materials of&#13;
11 percent. Assume that the observed share in output of labor was 25&#13;
percent in each'industry, while that of materials was 40 percent.    Failure&#13;
to adjust for production taxes would yield an estimate of TFPG of 2.85&#13;
percent. Assume now that the first industry had a production tax rate of&#13;
four percent on value added while the second had one of 20 percent. In&#13;
the first industry, the tax is four percent of 60 percent, so that the&#13;
"true" labor share is 25.6 percent, that of materials is 41 percent, and&#13;
that of capital is 33.4 percent. The revised TFPG estimate is 2.87&#13;
(compared with 2.85). In the second industry, with a tax of 20 percent&#13;
(on value added), the labor share is revised to 28.4 percent, the materials&#13;
share to 45.5 percent, and that of capital to 26.1 percent, and the TFPG&#13;
estimate is 2.97 percent. These numbers give some idea of the range of&#13;
bias imparted to our estimates: higher materials shares lower the scope&#13;
for bias, while higher capital shares raise it. In general, it does not&#13;
appear that failure to correct for the production tax could significantly&#13;
affect either the rank ordering of TFPG among industries, or the orders of&#13;
magnitude of our estimates. Under other circumstances, with taxes on&#13;
output (instead of value added) or higher tax rates, of course, the situa-&#13;
tion might be different.&#13;
A second problem also presented itself: as mentioned above, ideally&#13;
one should use a Divisia index of inputs, altering shares of each input&#13;
from year to year. After some experimentation, this procedure was not&#13;
followed for Turkish data because of th(J extreme volatility of the observed&#13;
factor shares from year to year. Indeed, there were even instances of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A- 7&#13;
reported negative returns to capital (as we computed the return), in which&#13;
case use of the Divisia index would have resulted in an assumed negative&#13;
share of capital for the affected industries for some part of the period.'&#13;
Extreme volatility of factor payments and of output also led us to&#13;
use trend values of outputs and inputs as computed by regressions of the&#13;
variables on time, rather than initial-year and terminal-year observa-&#13;
tions to estimate TFPG.    Of the surprises encountered when dealing with&#13;
the data, perhaps the greatest was the large short-run vQlatility of the&#13;
variables.&#13;
Ultimately, average factor shares were used in conjunction with time-&#13;
trend rates of growth of outputs and inputs to estimate TFPG.    No correc-&#13;
1. The use of negative elasticities gives meaningless results. In one&#13;
computer run, a sector which had experienced negative output growth while&#13;
accumulating capital with its workforce and materials inputs unchanged was&#13;
computed to have had rapid TFPG: the high rates of capital accumulation,&#13;
with its negative sign increased TFPG.&#13;
2. We also experimented with taking an average of the first two years&#13;
and then last two years and computing the average growth rate between those&#13;
two periods. Even the, the trend value estimates were deemed preferable,&#13;
because single-year fluctuations in the first or last two years still in-&#13;
fluenced the estimates unduly, in our judgment.&#13;
3. The range of possible TFPG estimates is bounded by highest and lowest&#13;
shares. To test the sensitivity of results, we examined sector 36, which&#13;
had an above-average change in input shares and above-average differences&#13;
in rates of growth of inputs within the public-and private sector. Labor&#13;
share was lowest in 1963 in both public and private sectors. For the private&#13;
sector it was highest in 1971 (but never reatta?ined that level) and second&#13;
highest in 1976. For the public sector it was highest in 1975 (at 21.'/&#13;
percent of the value of output) and was 21.0 percent in 1976.&#13;
The following estimates of TFPG are obtained:&#13;
Private          Public&#13;
First-year shares        .56              2.98&#13;
Average                  .62              2.53&#13;
Last-year shares         .67              2.01&#13;
In general, the private sector substituted more toward capital than did the&#13;
public sector, so that shares changed less. In sector 36, for example,&#13;
the labor share was the same (at 9.8 percent) in 1963. By 1976, the&#13;
private sector share had risen to 14.3 percent and that of the public sector&#13;
to 21.0 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-8&#13;
tion was possible for underutilization of capital stock and no&#13;
information was available to alter the observed "rnumber of employees" to&#13;
a more suitable measure such as man-hours (or to take account of any quality&#13;
changes in the labor force). Especially since strikes can affect indus-&#13;
tries for part of a year this latter omission may be at least as serious&#13;
as the former, although using time-trends reduces the likelihood that years&#13;
of extreme underutilization of capacity (which was not a prevalent phe-&#13;
nomenon in Turkey during the period under observation) or of part-year&#13;
work significantly affected the results.&#13;
Size Bias&#13;
The State Institute of Statistics and State Planning Organization&#13;
data cover only firms with ten or more employees. Insofar as data are&#13;
consistent, reporting all output and inputs for firms with ten or more&#13;
workers and no output or inputs for firms with less than ten employees,&#13;
estimated rates of TFPG are not affected. The reported rate of growth&#13;
of output and inputs do, however, overstate industry growth rates for&#13;
sectors where small firms become large enough to be enumerated. If,&#13;
however, prior investments of small firms are not included in capital&#13;
stock estimates when those firms expand to employ ten or more workers&#13;
(and other firms do not shrink their employment in offsetting fashion),&#13;
capital stock estimates will be understated. This in fact turned out.to&#13;
be the flaw in our effort to construct a capital stock series by per-&#13;
petual inventory methods.&#13;
For census years in Turkey, there has been a complete enumeration of&#13;
firms, so it is possible to draw some inferences about the relative import-&#13;
ance of small firms over time, and also their relative importance in dif-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-9&#13;
ferent sectors of the Turkish economy. Appendix Tables A-1 and A-2&#13;
give details.  As can be seen, in 1970 there were three sectors, wearing&#13;
apparel and footwear, wood and cork products, and furniture and fixtures,&#13;
in which firms with less than ten employees produced in excess of half of&#13;
industry output. This makes our data and estimates for those sectors in-&#13;
herently more unreliable than that for sectors where a very sizable fraction&#13;
of output was produced in firms covered by the Annual Surveys.&#13;
Table A-2 shows the diminishing role of smaller firms over time. Where-&#13;
as 51 percent of manufacturing employment was in firms employing less than&#13;
teni workers in 1963, only 39 percent of employment was in those firms in&#13;
19-0. In terms of value added, the share of small firms fell from 20 per-&#13;
cent in 1963 to 12 percent in 1970. That trend undoubtedly continued over&#13;
the 1970-76 period, although there are no further data available with which&#13;
to track the trend.&#13;
Interesting questions arise from examining the data in Tables A-1 and&#13;
A-2. If small firms are less productive than large firms, then the increas-&#13;
ing importance of firms with ten or more employees should itself constitute&#13;
a source of TFPG not covered by our estimates. If, on the other hand,&#13;
small firms concentrate on labor-intensive methods of production (while&#13;
not subject to social insurance laws, minimum wage provisions, and other&#13;
constraints on the employment of labor in the large-scale sector), in-&#13;
creasing concentration of output and value added in larger firms could&#13;
be a source of upward bias in our estimates to the extent that smaller&#13;
firms were more efficient in their use of inputs than larger ones.&#13;
This is an important question, but one on which the data available do&#13;
not provide a means to answer.&#13;

Perpetual Inventory Estimates of Capital Stock&#13;
For reasons stated in the text, we ultimately used SP0 estimates of&#13;
capital stock. Prior to doing so, however, considerable time and effort&#13;
was devoted to building our own perpetual inventory estimates. The pro-&#13;
cedures, and lessons we learned from them may be of value to other re-&#13;
searchers. Had our nominal investment data not been flawed, it is our&#13;
judgment that our procedure would have been satisfactory.&#13;
Estimates of capital stock were formed by depreciating existing&#13;
capital stock and adding new investment to it. A benchmark was provided&#13;
by assuming that the 1965 SP0 data were correct for the end of the year.&#13;
The estimates of investment from the Survey of Manufactures were then con-&#13;
verted to. 1963 prices, using the SP0 deflators. The missing data for 1969&#13;
were filled in by the following procedure. First, the average of 1968&#13;
and 1970 SP0 total investment figures was computed separately for public&#13;
and private investments. Then, these ratios were used to multiply the&#13;
average of individual sector (public and private separately) investments&#13;
for 1968 and 1970 to derive an estimated 1969 figure. The same procedure&#13;
was used for 1972 investments since the 1979 Annual Survey did not givie&#13;
any figures for investments.&#13;
The next step was to obtain estimates of economic rates of depreciation.&#13;
The SP0 has estimated that, in Turkey, the econor'. ife of a building is&#13;
2&#13;
33 years, while for machinery and equipment it is 15 years.   About two-thirds&#13;
1. Capital stock figures came from State Planning Organization, Turkiye&#13;
Imalat Sanayiinde Sermaye ve Isgucu (Capital and Labor in Turkish Manufactu-&#13;
ring Industry), December 1977. The estimates are for 15 sectors. We dis-&#13;
aggregated by taking the average shares of investment over 1963 to 1965&#13;
of 20 and 21 in "food and beverages," 23 and 24 in "textiles and clothing,"&#13;
25 and 26 in "wood products and furniture." We then prorated the SP0 esti-&#13;
mates over the appropriate subitems.&#13;
2. State Planning Organization, Turkiye Imalat Sanayiinde Sermaye ve Isgucu,&#13;
2op cit., p. 24.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-13&#13;
of total investment is in machinery and equipment and about one-third in&#13;
buildings and other construction. The economic life of buildings does&#13;
not appear to vary significantly across industries, but that for maclhin-&#13;
ery and equipment may. We therefore used estimates for economic life of&#13;
machinery and equipment in the United States, scaled so that the weighted&#13;
average was 15 years.   The length of life for machinery and equipment&#13;
so obtained is given-in Column (3) of Appendix Table A-3. We then muilti-&#13;
plied those estimates by two-thirds and added 11 (one-third times the&#13;
length of the life of buildings) to form the estimate of each sector's&#13;
depreciation rate.&#13;
Using those depreciation rates and the known rates of investment in&#13;
1965 prices, we were able to estimate capital stock.  For 1963 through&#13;
1965, we subtracted the investment in those years, and added back in&#13;
implied depreciation. For later years, we added investment and subtracted&#13;
estimated depreciation on a straight line basis. This was done in such&#13;
a way that it was assumed that investment in year t became a part of&#13;
operational capital stock in year t plus one. For example, 1967 capital&#13;
stock was formed by taking the appropriate depreciation rate for the 1965&#13;
capital stock (which was taken from SPO data to be.1966 capital because&#13;
it was an end-of-year figure) and adding to it .the SIS-reported 1966&#13;
investment.&#13;
1. Data were from W. R. Park, Cost Engineering Analysis, John Wiley arid Sons,&#13;
New York, 1973, p. 99, Table 26. To set the weighted average equal to that&#13;
estimated by the SPO, we took the share of each industry in output in 1968,&#13;
and multiplied that share times that industry's assigned depreciatiorn rate.&#13;
We then estimated the average length of life for all manufacturing, which&#13;
turned out to be 14.45 years.  We therefore multiplied the estimate for each&#13;
individual sector by 1.0376 to equate the weighted average to the SPO estim;it:e.&#13;

Although any such procedure is subject to errors, experimentation&#13;
with different rates of depreciation and different methods of depreciation&#13;
(other than straight line) did not appear to alter the estimates signi-&#13;
ficantly. It should be noted that insofar as the method was wrong by the&#13;
same factor for each sector, the ranking of industries in terms of total&#13;
factor productivity cannot be affected unless the time-stream of invest-&#13;
ment differed by much more than appears to have been the case over Turkish&#13;
industries.   The difference between a 12.5-year economic life and a&#13;
15-year economic life, for example, was about a percentage point difference&#13;
in the rate of growth of capital stock over the 13 year period.&#13;
1. If one industry had virtually no growth of capital stock and another&#13;
industry all new capital, while the first industry had a true straight-line&#13;
depreciation of capital and the second an economic life and then ceased to&#13;
function, we would understate the second industry's rate of growth of&#13;
capital stock relative to the first's. But there was no evidence that the&#13;
time path of depreciation differs significantly between industries-&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper studies the sources of growth
            from the supply side in Turkish manufacturing over the
            period 1963-1976. Primary factors and intermediate inputs
            are explicitly included in both the theoretical framework
            and the empirical analysis. The empirical analysis is based
            on data on output and factor inputs, at the two-digit
            industry level including eighteen manufacturing industries.
            The major findings are that: there is: (1) a secular
            declining trend in productivity growth over the period due
            perhaps to the continuing reliance on an import-substitution
            development strategy; (2) periods of especially low
            productivity growth are roughly those in which there were
            especially restrictive foreign exchange controls; (3) the
            public sector had a higher rate of total factor productivity
            than the private sector although it was absolutely less
            efficient; and (4) there was no pronounced tendency for
            import-substitution industries to have higher total factor
            productivity growth than more traditional industries.
