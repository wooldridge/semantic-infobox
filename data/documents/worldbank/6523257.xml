                                                      WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is an international partnership administered by The World Bank and&#13;
supported by more than 14 donor agencies, with a mission to alleviate poverty by helping poor people to gain&#13;
sustained access to improved water and sanitation services. WSP promotes dialogue and exchange of knowledge&#13;
on best practices on water and sanitation issues for capacity building and sector reform.&#13;
&#13;
WSP works through partnerships with and between governmental institutions, NGOs, private organizations,&#13;
and international development agencies in 19 countries in Africa, Latin America, East Asia and the Pacific and&#13;
South Asia. WSP is headquartered in Washington DC, and operates through four regional offices in India,&#13;
Indonesia, Kenya, and Peru.&#13;
&#13;
The focus and scope of WSP's work in Africa is reviewed periodically by the Regional Advisory Committee,&#13;
which brings together clients (policy makers and managers in national sector and sub-sector institutions) from&#13;
the countries where WSP-AF is active as well as representatives from funding partners, regional sector&#13;
organizations/programs and development partners.&#13;
&#13;
The RAC meets about every 18 months.&#13;
&#13;
The RAC meeting held in Nairobi in May 2004 endorsed WSP-AF focus on the WSS/MDGs and called for&#13;
extending WSP-AF support to other countries.&#13;
&#13;
This report covers proceedings of the RAC meeting held at the Hilton Hotel in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 3-4&#13;
May 2005. The meeting was attended by 40 people. They include: 11 client partners from six of WSP-AF's focus&#13;
countries; six funding partners; eight strategic partners; and, 15 WSP staff members and consultants. Martha&#13;
Solomon, Ministry of Water Resources, Ethiopia, was the overall chair of the meeting, while individual sessions&#13;
were chaired by RAC client members. The meeting agenda, evaluation and participants are annexed to the&#13;
report.&#13;

&#13;
3.     Proceedings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1    Opening Plenary&#13;
&#13;
Martha Solomon, Head of Policy, Development Cooperation and External Relations, Ministry of Water&#13;
Resources, Ethiopia, presided over the opening plenary. She welcomed the participants and set the tone for the&#13;
meeting by stressing its importance both to WSP-AF and to its stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Matar Fall, AFTU2, World Bank, welcomed the participants on behalf of the World Bank, the host agency of&#13;
the WSP. He stressed the importance of water and sanitation work and welcomed the involvement of civil&#13;
society and the private sector in it. He reiterated the World Bank's support for WSP, highlighting its work&#13;
linking knowledge to investment advice and on the MDGs. He thanked WSP's funding partners for their&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, WSP Program Manager, emphasised the importance of this RAC meeting to WSP-AF. He&#13;
noted that Africa is finally receiving more attention from the world community, and that the MDG reporting&#13;
process will draw attention to the problems faced in Africa. He described WSP's principles to focus on&#13;
individual countries while sharing experiences around the world, and the main themes for its work in FY2006,&#13;
including MDG roadmapping, sanitation and hygiene, rural work and the domestic private sector. He also&#13;
outlined the process for preparing and approving WSP's Business Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Abera Mekonnen, speaking on behalf of Minister Shiferaw Jarso, formally welcomed the visitors to Ethiopia. He&#13;
highlighted the importance of global partnerships to attain the MDGs everywhere and especially in Africa. He&#13;
briefly described some of the current issues in water and sanitation in Ethiopia, thanked WSP-AF for its support&#13;
to the Ethiopian Government, and officially opened the meeting.&#13;
&#13;
Dennis Mwanza, facilitator of this RAC meeting, conducted introductions for all participants, and invited them&#13;
to add their own expectations for the meeting. Jon Lane, director of this meeting, presented the objectives and&#13;
agenda of the meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2     WSP-AF's Overall Direction&#13;
&#13;
Overall Progress Report&#13;
&#13;
During plenary, Piers Cross presented a progress report covering WSP-AF's main activities since the last RAC&#13;
meeting in Nairobi in April 2004 and its plans for the coming year. After a brief introduction on the context of&#13;
water and poverty in Africa and WSP-AF's history to date, he covered the following points:&#13;
&#13;
The water and sanitation MDG challenge in Africa&#13;
&#13;
Lack of access to water and sanitation is a central element of poverty. Africa is the only continent currently not&#13;
on track to achieve the water and sanitation MDGs. The pace of service extension is too slow, and the number&#13;
of people unserved, especially with sanitation, is increasing. Major effort is needed to meet the MDG challenge&#13;
in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's mission and strategy&#13;
&#13;
WSP's mission is to help poor people to gain sustained access to improved water and sanitation services. It is a&#13;
global, field-based partnership that supports its country clients to reduce poverty through policies, innovative&#13;
solutions, best practices and the capacity to sustain access.&#13;
&#13;
The entry points for WSP-AF are the institutional reform currently ongoing in many African countries, the high&#13;
dependence on external funding, and the lack of capacity to implement programmes on the ground. Based on&#13;
those entry points, WSP-AF has a clear focus on particular countries based on criteria of impact and viability of&#13;
its work; its products include policy support, knowledge management and investment support. These contribute&#13;
to its goal of supporting its client governments' policies, strategies and capacities so that those clients can adopt&#13;
effective approaches at scale and thus enable poor people to attain sustained water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
The various external audits and evaluations carried out over the past year have confirmed that WSP-AF is&#13;
relevant, respected and has a special niche as a global, client-focused responsive sector agency.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's progress in moving to a regional water and sanitation MDG support program&#13;
&#13;
To date WSP-AF's work has covered a broad range of activities as indicated above. Now it intends to&#13;
concentrate its efforts principally on helping its clients to achieve the water and sanitation MDGs. Other&#13;
activities will continue but must contribute towards that specific aim.&#13;
&#13;
The main mechanism for the MDG support will be roadmaps: WSP-AF will help its clients to develop and&#13;
monitor roadmaps of their progress towards achieving the MDGs. This is not an imposed prescriptive process;&#13;
each roadmap will differ according to the country.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's work will revolve around these MDG roadmaps. In the last year, it has made major progress towards&#13;
this objective and much of its current work at country level is based on MDG roadmapping.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of what is new for WSP-AF in FY2006&#13;
&#13;
The two major features of WSP-AF's work are its emphasis on MDG roadmaps and its growth. WSP-AF's&#13;
budget and capacity to work is increasing rapidly, enabling it to work in more countries. In the current year&#13;
(FY05) its focus countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal and Uganda. In&#13;
FY06, DRCongo, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia will be added to this list, and in FY07 it intends to add Ghana,&#13;
Mauritius and Niger also.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's regional learning agenda will support its national MDG roadmap work, with an increasing focus on&#13;
implementing knowledge and lessons learned. It will develop specific new approaches in countries and parts of&#13;
countries that have particularly fragile social and political fabrics due to past conflicts: WSP-AF refers to these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
places as `fragile environments'. It will also support Africa-wide political dialogues such as AMCOW and&#13;
promote better external investment programs such as the AfDB's and EU's new funding mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
Participants' suggestions on WSP's overall direction&#13;
&#13;
The comments and suggestions made by participants, directly after this presentation and at various other times&#13;
during the RAC meeting, included:&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF is doing a good job and is appreciated by its client governments.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF should grow in order to help more countries. However, it should not overstretch and thus&#13;
         reduce its effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
    · The MDGs are the big political topics of our time and so WSP-AF's roadmap initiative is a good idea&#13;
         and must tie in with existing national planning mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
    · In the past, WSP-AF worked especially well at the regional level. It should maximise its emphasis on&#13;
         country-level work.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF's in-country activities (such as coordination among donors, linking donors to clients, linking&#13;
         knowledge and lessons to implementation and investment, analysing PRSPs, monitoring and working&#13;
         on indicators) are relevant and useful.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF should build on regional political visions and processes and its links to regional organisations.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF's influence is increased by its link to investments such as those of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
    · In concentrating its in-country support on the national government, WSP-AF should also monitor&#13;
         decentralisation processes and may need to work more with regional and local governments in future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3   WSP-AF's Country Plans&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's plans in its focus countries were discussed in small sub-regional groups of stakeholders. Naturally, the&#13;
main clients in each country are already familiar with its work plans, but this meeting format enabled them to&#13;
interact with clients in neighbouring countries and with other stakeholders. This interaction in turn benefits&#13;
WSP-AF's staff in their planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The main points derived from these discussions and fed back in plenary included:&#13;
&#13;
     Benin&#13;
&#13;
     Having identified that sanitation was lagging far behind water supply, WSP-AF is putting its efforts on&#13;
     sanitation. It is also working on handwashing promotion and on analysing financial flows in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
     Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF is working on the national MDG roadmap and also working on donor coordination and on&#13;
     national sanitation policy.&#13;
&#13;
     Democratic Republic of Congo&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF started work in February 2005 and is concentrating initially on urban sector reform, sector and&#13;
     donor coordination especially with the European Union and World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF's main work presently is supporting the government on developing a national sanitation policy.&#13;
     It also is supporting sector coordination and the MDG roadmap process. It provides good liaison with&#13;
     the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Kenya&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF has been prominent in sector reform for some years. It is also supporting the government on&#13;
     national sanitation policy and on the MDG roadmap. This is an example of WSP-AF taking reform&#13;
     forward to the next stage of implementation. In addition, WSP-AF's regional office and hub in Nairobi is&#13;
     supporting other country activities across the continent.&#13;
&#13;
     Malawi&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF has only a small presence, awaiting government's expression for more work in-country. It is&#13;
     contributing to sector coordination and channelling ideas and experiences between Malawi and other&#13;
     African countries, on,for example, waterpoint mapping.&#13;
&#13;
     Mozambique&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF is settling into its work in country, working mainly through CEDESA, a governmental&#13;
     thinktank. It is helping donor coordination and work towards the MDG roadmap. In addition, WSP-&#13;
     AF's hub in Maputo covers both Lusophone countries and Southern African countries and will&#13;
     coordinate its work with other sub-regional entities.&#13;
&#13;
     Niger&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF is helping the government's MDGs roadmap work and is advising the World Bank on its&#13;
     investment program.&#13;
&#13;
     Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
     WSP-AF is increasing its activity in country, mainly on rural sanitation, sector coordination and analysing&#13;
     financial flows in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
     Senegal&#13;
&#13;
     The water and sanitation sector is well-advanced, and the MDG roadmap complete. WSP-AF is&#13;
     supporting the government's work and carrying out a programme on handwashing promotion. In&#13;
     addition, WSP-AF's hub in Dakar covers West African countries and coordinates its work with other sub-&#13;
     regional entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Uganda&#13;
&#13;
       Sector reform is well-advanced so WSP-AF mainly helps the government on implementation and on the&#13;
       MDG roadmap process. It is also active in sector coordination and investment planning, for example for&#13;
       the World Bank. It will concentrate more on sanitation in future.&#13;
&#13;
       Zambia&#13;
&#13;
       WSP-AF has now established a permanent presence in country and is working mainly on donor&#13;
       coordination and MDG roadmap planning.&#13;
&#13;
Although WSP-AF does some work in Ghana, Mauritania, Nigeria, Tanzania and Yemen, they were not&#13;
discussed at this particular RAC meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4    WSP-AF's Main Thematic Activities&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's thematic activities were introduced by background papers and brief plenary presentations to highlight&#13;
the main feature of each thematic activity. It continued in the form of an open session in which all participants&#13;
could discuss these subjects individually in more detail with the Thematic Task Leaders.&#13;
&#13;
Urban work&#13;
&#13;
Alain Morel explained that currently, the main emphasis of WSP-AF's urban work is to take pro-poor practice to&#13;
scale by:&#13;
&#13;
    · reforming utilities;&#13;
&#13;
    · strengthening the local private sector;&#13;
&#13;
    · strengthening the voice of consumers.&#13;
&#13;
Rural work&#13;
&#13;
Joseph Narkevic emphasised that WSP-AF is doing many different activities on rural work. The problem is to&#13;
achieve large-scale impact. WSP-AF's current concept is FRUGAL, in which one contractor manages rural water&#13;
over a large area for several years.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation and hygiene&#13;
&#13;
Ousseynou Diop presented WSP-AF's main emphases in sanitation and hygiene as:&#13;
&#13;
    · promoting work on marketing of sanitation;&#13;
&#13;
    · improving professional contacts visa the AfricaSan meeting series;&#13;
&#13;
    · trying to link knowledge better to work on the ground&#13;
&#13;
Working in Fragile Environments&#13;
&#13;
Jean Doyen introduced this new activity for WSP-AF by describing the places where the social fabric is&#13;
disturbed or broken and emphasising the external support agencies' moral obligation to help them. He explained&#13;
that every such place is different. At present WSP-AF is concentrating on learning how to work effectively in&#13;
these places.&#13;
&#13;
Finance&#13;
&#13;
Meera Mehta reiterated that water supply and sanitation have failed to feature in many countries' PRSPs. WSP-&#13;
AF's main work on finance is therefore:&#13;
&#13;
    · moving on from analysing financial flows to developing strategies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    · monitoring the performance of the water and sanitation sector;&#13;
&#13;
    · encouraging new resources from new mechanisms (e.g. loans, communities).&#13;
&#13;
Communications and Knowledge Management&#13;
&#13;
Toni Sittoni described the three main elements of WSP-AF's communications and knowledge management&#13;
work as:&#13;
&#13;
    · strengthening WSP's knowledge value chain through improved production, dissemination and&#13;
        evaluation of knowledge and advocacy tools;&#13;
&#13;
    · communication support to meet the information and advocacy needs of WSP-Africa's country and&#13;
        thematic programs, and MDG advocacy;&#13;
&#13;
    · building country client capacity for strategic reform communication.&#13;
&#13;
MDGs planning&#13;
&#13;
Dennis Mwanza (who works closely with WSP-AF) described how all of the thematic activities relate to the&#13;
process of achieving the MDGs. WSP-AF is working specifically to help clients to develop roadmaps on how to&#13;
achieve the water and sanitation MDGs. These build on existing processes and systems. WSP-AF is also working&#13;
on indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.5   RAC Governance Session&#13;
&#13;
The main topics covered were governance, management and staffing (presented by Piers Cross) and finance&#13;
(presented by Hesbon Odhiambo).&#13;
&#13;
Governance&#13;
&#13;
WSP's Charter documents its governance system which comprises global governance by the Council, regional&#13;
governance through the RAC, and national governance through Strategic Cooperation Alliances with client&#13;
governments. Five SCAs have been signed with national governments so far. They will be complemented by an&#13;
appropriate form of steering group in each country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        7&#13;

                                                     WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management&#13;
&#13;
At the global level, WSP's Program Manager Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez works with a management team comprising the&#13;
four Regional Team Leaders. Within Africa, WSP-AF has its regional headquarters in Nairobi, three sub-regional&#13;
hubs in Dakar, Maputo and Nairobi, and country offices in two other countries, shortly increasing to seven.&#13;
Liaison offices will soon be opened in Tunis (for AfDB) and Kampala (for AMCOW). The structure is a matrix&#13;
of these geographical arrangements intersected by thematic teams.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF now plans to improve its managerial strength by:&#13;
&#13;
    · forming a regional management team;&#13;
&#13;
    · strengthening its administrative and human resources function;&#13;
&#13;
    · supporting its in-country work more closely through sub-regional teams.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's staff development strategy seeks to:&#13;
&#13;
    · maintain high quality of staff, through good recruitment processes;&#13;
&#13;
    · reduce costs by using consultants;&#13;
&#13;
    · encourage diversity of skills, ethnicity and gender.&#13;
&#13;
In FY06 WSP-AF will recruit liaison staff and sub-regional team leaders and technical staff, to strengthen the&#13;
managerial functions described above. This will increase its full-time staff numbers from 21 to 27.&#13;
&#13;
Finance&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's finances are strong. With some 15 donors, most on 2-3 year fiunding cycles, its annual budget is&#13;
growing from approximately $US5 million in FY05 to $US7-9 million in FY06. Of this, half will be spent in&#13;
countries and half on thematic activities management and training.&#13;
&#13;
The finance and administration staff in Nairobi now number six people, including one dedicated to human&#13;
resource development.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF's future financial emphases will be:&#13;
&#13;
    · to try to increase unrestricted funds as a proportion of its total income;&#13;
&#13;
    · to encourage longer-term commitment by donors;&#13;
&#13;
    · hence to increase the time horizon of its financial planning process (currently annual).&#13;
&#13;
Participants' suggestions on governance issues&#13;
&#13;
The presentations on these topics were well-received by the participants. They raised some specific governance&#13;
points both in this session and at various other times during the meeting:&#13;
&#13;
    · It is important, and appreciated, that WSP-AF involves its client governments in the strategic decisions&#13;
        about its work.&#13;
&#13;
    · Governance at the national level has varied in the past; so the SCAs are a welcome development. The&#13;
        steering committee to monitor and supervise WSP-AF's work against each SCA should, if possible, be&#13;
        an existing national group and not another new body.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF's emphasis on in-country work, and especially MDG roadmap work, should lead to increased&#13;
        staff numbers in the country offices as opposed to the regional office and sub-regional hubs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    · The sub-headings and relative allocations in WSP-AF's budget should correspond more clearly to those&#13;
         in its plans.&#13;
&#13;
    · WSP-AF should continue its progress towards fully bilingual working.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.6    Group Discussions and Open Session&#13;
&#13;
There were two group discussion sessions, subdivided according to geography and stakeholder type respectively,&#13;
and an informal open session for individual interactions. The main points raised in the geographical groups have&#13;
been included in section 3.3 above.&#13;
&#13;
During the stakeholder group discussions, it was expressed that WSP-AF is doing good work on the right&#13;
subjects. To improve the quality of its work and add value, they made the following suggestions to WSP-AF:&#13;
&#13;
    · Give more support to countries that have low water and sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
    · Work more on donor coordination in countries.&#13;
&#13;
    · Correlate its thematic work more closely with its country work.&#13;
&#13;
    · Improve its advocacy skills.&#13;
&#13;
    · Use its knowledge to influence donors' investments towards the good practice that it has identified.&#13;
&#13;
    · Disseminate its knowledge more widely.&#13;
&#13;
    · Be aware of the wider target groups for its products, services and collaboration (for example NGOs,&#13;
         private sector, resource centres).&#13;
&#13;
    · Improve its links with WSP's other regions around the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.7    Closing Plenary&#13;
&#13;
The meeting discussed the future frequency of RAC meetings. There was an even balance between the&#13;
arguments for annual and biennial meetings. Given the importance of the MDG roadmap planning work, it was&#13;
agreed to hold a meeting next year in Maputo, Mozambique principally about MDG roadmaps but probably also&#13;
incorporating the functions of the RAC meeting. By then, the RAC members will have agreed the frequency of&#13;
meetings after that one.&#13;
&#13;
Regarding a formal post of Chair of the RAC, Piers Cross explained the past tradition of the host country&#13;
chairing each meeting. He would appreciate the chair's occasional availability between meetings to give advice&#13;
and strategic support to himself as Regional Team Leader. On this basis, Rui Gonzales (Coordinator, CEDESA,&#13;
Mozambique) agreed to provide that support though not necessarily with the formal title of RAC Chair.&#13;
&#13;
The participants completed an end of meeting evaluation. (see Annex 2).&#13;
&#13;
Jon Lane, director of this RAC meeting, gave a brief verbal summary of the meeting, which covered the main&#13;
points now included in this written report.&#13;
&#13;
Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Chair of the closing plenary, on behalf of all the participants, thanked the Government of&#13;
Ethiopia for hosting the meeting. He thanked all the participants, the staff of WSP-AF, interpreters and venue&#13;
staff for all their help, and declared the meeting closed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
This was another successful and productive RAC meeting. It achieved the objectives set out in section 2 above.&#13;
&#13;
The meeting was supportive of the two major features of WSP-AF's current work, namely its growth and its&#13;
concentration on supporting national MDG roadmaps.&#13;
&#13;
The meeting endorsed the direction and content of WSP-AF's Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2006 and made&#13;
helpful suggestions for improving various aspects of WSP-AF's work. These suggestions have been listed above&#13;
in sections 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6 regarding overall direction, governance, and quality of work respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The participants' own evaluations of the meeting indicated the following:&#13;
&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
       · There was a appreciation of the workshop in general. More than three-quarters of the respondents&#13;
           found the workshop to be interesting, well paced, well-organized and relaxed. The overall rating&#13;
           assesses the RAC to have been a useful meeting for the participants. But the evaluation also points to&#13;
           some aspects that call for attention.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
There were mixed reactions whether RAC fully achieved its objectives:&#13;
&#13;
       · There was general consensus that the RAC had successfully provided a forum for frank consultation&#13;
           between WSP-AF and its main stakeholders; and facilitated stimulating discussion among and&#13;
           between staff and clients. More than two-thirds of the respondents found time to network and&#13;
           developed useful contacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      · But there was half-response whether the RAC was successful in focusing attention on MDG&#13;
         roadmap planning process in Africa; or that it provided clear guidance on the overall direction for&#13;
         WSP-AF's future work.&#13;
&#13;
      · About more than two thirds of the respondents either disagreed or were unsure whether or not the&#13;
         RAC had successfully reviewed WSP-AF's planned activities for FY06; nor that it presented&#13;
         opportunities for sharing lessons learnt from WSP and partner experiences. Fewer than half of the&#13;
         respondents found the RAC to be the forum that sufficiently challenges them to think in innovative&#13;
         ways and to consider new approaches to apply in their work.&#13;
&#13;
Sessions&#13;
&#13;
   · Except for the session on RAC governance, the thematic presentations and WSP-AF progress report&#13;
       session made least impression on the respondents. More than half the respondents indicated they were&#13;
       not too enthused by presentations on thematic or country work (including Sanitation and Hygiene,&#13;
       Urban work, Rural Water Supply, Fragile Environments, Sector Finance, MDG Planning, Knowledge&#13;
       Dissemination and Communications).&#13;
&#13;
Conference organization&#13;
&#13;
   · The general consensus gave a thumbs-up for conference facilitation, quality and availability of&#13;
       publications and conference materials. The host city/country, choice of venue, conference facilities,&#13;
       accommodation, food and services also received high ratings.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
What part of RAC did you find LEAST useful?&#13;
      · Country presentations could have been handled in more detail. (5)&#13;
      · Thematic presentations were too short (5)&#13;
      · Less time for informal discussions&#13;
      · The country work plan discussions in groups.&#13;
      · Thematic presentations were too many&#13;
      · Second set of group discussions&#13;
      · It was not clear what the expectations of WSP in the governance session were.&#13;

&#13;
What modifications or recommendations would you make in order to improve next year's RAC?&#13;
      · Make it a two year event ????&#13;
      · The questionnaires for the working groups on both Day 1 and 2 were too WSP centric and generally repetitive. The&#13;
         questionnaire should be more open and invite comments on specific topics.&#13;
      · More thematic/Strategic discussions (2)&#13;
      · Timely dissemination of conference documents (3)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                               WSP-Africa Regional Advisory Committee Meeting, 3-4 May 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       · Better Thematic focus (6)&#13;
       · MDG road map&#13;
       · Set up a country led steering committee to address specific issues and bring up strategic issues to the RAC.&#13;
       · Focus more clearly on the main theme and have a presentation on 2-3 key country experiences in some detail.&#13;
       · WSP impact is supposed to be felt at the country level but the RAC seemed to pay more attention to the thematic work. A bit&#13;
         more attention and time to country work could be beneficial.&#13;
       · Better briefing prior to the meeting.&#13;
       · Clearer guidance on what aspects of the BP are open to change or amending prior to presentation for endorsement. I assume&#13;
         the WSP council does this.&#13;
       · A shorter document instead of the complicated BP. Strategy rather than details. (3)&#13;
       · Better venue&#13;
       · WSP proactive ability in ensuring better client country representatives. (2)&#13;
       · Presentation of WSP programme and functioning at the beginning ( Piers's presentation was last)&#13;
       · More NGOs (there is plenty in Ethiopia)&#13;
       · More time in country activity discussions. (2)&#13;
       · You want to achieve too many objectives in 2 days. Expectation should go down and focus on fewer aspects but more in&#13;
         depth.&#13;
&#13;
Additional comments:&#13;
       · Good meeting and please keep the team for continuity. Any evaluation done for the RAC?&#13;
       · Thank you WSP for inviting me. (2)&#13;
       · Take note of various contributions, they are subjective depending on the background of each participant i.e. How do you&#13;
         address capacity gaps of donor partners?&#13;
       · Why aren't you asking USAID or the American Government or American Foundations to commit itself in WSP? You need&#13;
         to expand.&#13;
       · Donor support is geared towards support for donor country staff. How can WSP change this. Or is it that people who are&#13;
         poor cannot demand anything despite the talk?&#13;
       · Can WSP give us examples of how its involvement in supporting processes/policies/best practice articulation has translated&#13;
         into actual/sustainable service provision 2-3 years on?&#13;
       · Issue on how WSP takes on board the concerns and suggestions which come from the floor and discussion sessions.&#13;
       · As a network, it is important to have details of participants.&#13;
       · Well done&#13;
       · Involve clients in the early stages of the RAC.&#13;
       · An overview of the work plan rather than showing which theme is being addressed in which countries would be helpful.&#13;
