&#13;
NOTE 1 -- ORgANIZATION&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was established on&#13;
October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States. The Centre provides such&#13;
facilities for cases brought under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, or&#13;
where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission&#13;
on International Trade Law. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative Arrangements which were&#13;
effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre. The Memorandum of Administrative&#13;
Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may charge&#13;
the parties to proceedings, for fees and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions,Arbitral&#13;
Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities and services to the Centre, as&#13;
described in Notes 2 and 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 -- SIgNIfICANT ACCOUNTINg POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements have been&#13;
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America (US GAAP) and with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such financial&#13;
statements are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 117,&#13;
Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations (SFAS No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net&#13;
assets are classified in accordance with donor restrictions; however, the Centre has no net assets as of&#13;
June 30, 2008 and June 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP and&#13;
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts&#13;
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with the related disclosures as at the date of&#13;
the financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management estimates the amount of unbilled expenses incurred by arbitrators, and related revenues,&#13;
for ongoing cases at each year end.The nature of arbitration/conciliation cases handled by the Centre&#13;
involves input from arbitrators who charge fees for their service based on time spent on the cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 0 8     |    6 7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO fINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The determination of arbitrators' fees and expenses incurred for ongoing cases involves an estimation&#13;
process using information received from the arbitrators on unbilled time spent on the cases through&#13;
end of the fiscal year. In the event arbitrators do not provide information on the fees and expenses&#13;
in time for preparation of the financial statements, the determination of arbitrators' fees and expenses&#13;
incurred for ongoing cases is based on estimated time spent by the arbitrators in relation to the&#13;
progress of the case and the number of proceedings through to the end of the year.Actual results of&#13;
arbitrator fees earned but unbilled, and arbitration/conciliation case expenses incurred as at year end&#13;
may differ materially from management's estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share in Pooled Investments: The Centre's share in the pooled investments is reported at fair value.&#13;
Resulting gains and losses are reported as investment income due to parties to arbitration/conciliation&#13;
proceedings in statements of financial position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Due from Parties to the Arbitration/Conciliation Proceedings: Direct expenses incurred by arbitrators&#13;
in excess of advance payments made by the parties to the ongoing arbitration/conciliation proceedings&#13;
are recognized as due from parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings and are callable in&#13;
accordance withthe Centre's Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other assets: The Centre's other assets comprise of software purchased during the year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration/Conciliation Proceedings: The Centre's direct expenses&#13;
attributable to arbitration/conciliation proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the&#13;
Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations).These direct expenses are funded&#13;
by advances from parties, and include fees and travel expenses of arbitrators and the costs associated&#13;
with engaging meeting rooms and supporting services for conducting proceedings. In accordance&#13;
with these Regulations, the Centre's Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits&#13;
with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses. Accordingly, the Centre&#13;
recognizes revenues from these transactions during the period and to the extent expenses are incurred&#13;
related to arbitration/conciliation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to the parties: Investment&#13;
income earned on funds advanced from parties can be used for expenses related to arbitration/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
conciliation proceedings. After the completion of an arbitration/conciliation proceeding, if it is&#13;
determined that there is an excess of advances and investment income over expenditures for the&#13;
proceedings, the surplus is refunded to the parties in proportion to the amounts advanced by each&#13;
party to the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-kind Contributions: In accordance with Statement of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made,&#13;
the value of services provided by the Bank is determined by the estimated fair value of these services,&#13;
net of the Centre's reimbursements to the Bank and is recorded by the Centre as in-kind contributions&#13;
and also as expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
  (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
  (2) otheradministrativeservicesandfacilities,suchastravel,communications,officeaccommodations,&#13;

&#13;
Relevant Accounting and Reporting Developments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
InternationalAccounting Standards Board (IASB):On August 18,2005, the InternationalAccounting&#13;
Standards Board (IASB) issued a number of new standards and revisions to existing standards.&#13;
However, except for IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the revision to IAS 1, Presentation&#13;
of Financial Statements, none of the new or revised standards are relevant to these financial statements.&#13;
IFRS 7 has been adopted in these financial statements.The Centre is currently evaluating the impact&#13;
of IAS 1 which is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair&#13;
Value Measurements. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy and expands&#13;
disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after&#13;
November 15, 2007, which would be the year ending June 30, 2009 for the Centre.The Centre will&#13;
adopt FAS 157 in the year ended June 30, 2009 and is currently assessing the impact of this standard&#13;
on its financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO fINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The FairValue Option for Financial Assets and Financial&#13;
Liabilities, which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value measurement for&#13;
certain financial assets and financial liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. FAS 159 is effective&#13;
for all fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which would be the year ending June 30,&#13;
2009 in the case of the Centre.The Centre is currently assessing the impact of this standard on&#13;
its financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 -- SHARE IN POOLED INVESTMENTS&#13;
Amounts paid to the Centre, but not yet disbursed, are managed by the Bank, which maintains a&#13;
single investment portfolio (the Pool) for all of the trust funds administered by the Bank, the&#13;
International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency (the "World Bank Group"), and the funds of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the Pool's assets separate and apart from the funds of the World Bank Group.&#13;
The Pool is further divided into sub-portfolios to which allocations are made based on fund-specific&#13;
investment horizons, risk tolerances and other eligibility requirements set by the Bank. Generally, the&#13;
Pool is invested in liquid financial instruments such as money market instruments, government and&#13;
agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and other high-grade bonds. The Pool may also&#13;
include securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements with other counter parties.&#13;
Additionally, the Pool may include receivables from resale agreements for which it has accepted&#13;
collateral. Based on the Bank's investment strategy for trust funds, each sub-portfolio is invested in a&#13;
combination of these asset types consistent with the applicable risk tolerance for that sub-portfolio.&#13;
The Centre's funds are invested in a sub-portfolio of the Pooled Investments which invests solely in&#13;
cash and money market instruments with terms of three months or less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the investments on a pooled accounting basis.The pooled investments are&#13;
reported at fair value. Share in Pooled Investments represents the Centre's pro-rata share of the&#13;
Pool's fair value at the end of the reporting period.The fair value is based on market quotations,&#13;
where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on generally&#13;
accepted valuation techniques based on other observable market data. The corresponding&#13;
proportionate realized and unrealized gains/losses and interest income are accrued in the period&#13;
in which they occur.&#13;

are reported at fair value.The Centre share in the Pool is not traded in any market; however, the&#13;
underlying assets within the Pool are traded in the market and are reported at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at cost.Their carrying value is considered&#13;
to be a reasonable estimate of fair value because none of the instruments are considered to be&#13;
impaired and they are short-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 6 -- RISK ARISINg fROM fINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
The majority of the Centre's assets consist of its share in the Pool.The Pool is actively managed and&#13;
invested in accordance with the investment strategy established for all trust funds administered by the&#13;
World Bank Group.The objectives of the investment strategy are foremost to maintain adequate liquidity&#13;
to meet foreseeable cash flow needs and preserve capital and then to maximize investment returns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre is exposed to credit and liquidity risks. The risk management policies employed to&#13;
manage these risks are discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk ­ The risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and&#13;
cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Of the Centre's assets, the other assets are not subject&#13;
to credit risk.Therefore, the Centre's maximum credit exposure at the June 30, 2008 is equivalent to&#13;
the gross value of the remaining assets amounting to $16,986,216 (2007: $17,147,516).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO fINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank invests the Centre's share in pooled investments in money market deposits.The Bank is&#13;
limited to investments in Money market deposits issued or guaranteed by financial institutions whose&#13;
senior debt securities are rated at least A-.At the reporting date, approximately 100% of the Centre's&#13;
share of the investment portfolio is held in securities rated at least A+ and 92% is held in securities&#13;
rated at least AA-.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank defines the concentration of credit risk as the extent to which the pooled investments are&#13;
held by an individual counterparty. The concentration of credit risk with respect to the Pool of&#13;
investments is mitigated because the Bank has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to&#13;
any individual issuer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Amounts due from parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings result from ordinary course of&#13;
business.The amounts are neither past due or impaired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk ­ The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in raising liquid funds to meet its&#13;
commitments. ICSID regulations require parties to disputes to make advance deposits with the&#13;
Centre to meet anticipated expenses of arbitration/conciliation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 7 -- IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS&#13;
As described in Note 1, The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum)&#13;
provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may charge the parties to proceedings, for fees and&#13;
expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the&#13;
Bank shall provide facilities and services to the Centre.Therefore, in-kind contributions represents&#13;
the value of services provided by the Bank less amounts reimbursed to the Bank using proceeds from&#13;
non refundable fees and the sale of publications.&#13;

NOTE 8 -- RESTATEMENT&#13;
Subsequent to the issuance of the Centre's 2007 financial statements, the Centre's management&#13;
determined that expenses related to arbitration/conciliation proceedings of $2,658,668 recorded in&#13;
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, should have been recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.&#13;
As a result, the statement of activities and statements of cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2007&#13;
have been restated from the amounts previously reported to properly reflect these expenses and&#13;
related revenues from arbitration/conciliation proceedings.&#13;

            ICSID annual report 2008
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the annual report on the
            operation of the International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) required by Article 6(1) (g) of
            the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
            between States and Nationals of Other States. This annual
            report covers the fiscal year July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008.
            In fiscal year 2008, the number of pending ICSID cases rose
            by 12 percent year on-year and reached 145 cases, the
            highest yearly number ever administered by ICSID. Six other
            cases were administered under the Arbitration Rules of the
            United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
            (UNCITRAL). FY2008 witnessed a major set of reforms aimed at
            renewing ICSID's operational efficiency. Also in
            FY2008, the Republic of Bolivia's denunciation of the
            ICSID Convention marked the first withdrawal of a
            Contracting State from ICSID membership and reduced the
            number of the ICSID Contracting States to 143.
