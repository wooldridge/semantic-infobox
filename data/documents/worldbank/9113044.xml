            Doing privatization right
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A recent study examining privatization
            results in four Sub-Saharan African countries yielded two
            broad conclusions: First, privatization is not easy to do,
            and getting it right can be tough in low-income countries.
            Second, if privatization is done right and there is a little
            luck, it can lead to substantial welfare gains that are
            reasonably and equitably distributed across stakeholders,
            consumers, workers, governments, and owners or operators.
