(Grassroots Initiatives Association)&#13;
Beneficiary:        Targeted rural communities in Mopti and other regions, NGOs,&#13;
Observatory for Sustainable Human Development, National Statistical&#13;
Office (DNSI)&#13;
Poverty Category:    Poverty-targeted intervention&#13;
Credit Amount:       SDR 15.9 million (US$21.5 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard with 40 years maturity&#13;
Financing Plan:&#13;
IDA            : US$21.5 million&#13;
Government    : US$1.5 million&#13;
Project Objectives:&#13;
1.    The project objectives are: (i) to improve the living conditions of disadvantaged targeted&#13;
rural communities by responding to their priority needs; (ii) to strengthen capacity of&#13;
communities in identifying and ranking their priority needs and in planning, implementing and&#13;
supervising actions to respond to those needs, in partnership with NGOs and local authorities;&#13;
(iii) to strengthen institutional and policy-making capacity at the local and national levels in the&#13;
fight against hunger and poverty.&#13;
Project Description:&#13;
2.    The project has two components: (a) community development; and (b) policy and&#13;
institutional support to strengthen local and national decision-making on poverty issues. The&#13;
community development component is comprised of community-requested sub-projects,&#13;
accompanied by measures to strenghthen community development skills, IEC messages for&#13;
behavior change, and relevant training to ensure project sustainability and effective service&#13;
delivery. The policy and institutional support component will strengthen the effectiveness of&#13;
decision-makers at the national level by improving the quality and relevance of integrated&#13;
poverty data and data analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Project Benefits/Risks:&#13;
3.    The project would help reduce poverty in the most vulnerable rural communities in&#13;
Mopti and other regions. This would be achieved in the short term by financing sub-projects&#13;
identified by the communities themselves as having highest priority in improving their living&#13;
conditions. Direct beneficiaries of the sub-projects and capacity building activities are estimated&#13;
at roughly 130,000 persons. The training program will strengthen the managerial, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation skills of about 25 intermediaries, the communication skills and knowledge of&#13;
participatory methods and gender analysis of around 90 NGOs in community development&#13;
(NGO-CD) and 520 village animation agents; the organizational capacity of 130 village&#13;
management committees; and improve the collaboration of local technical services and&#13;
regional/local development committees. In addition, the project will indirectly touch neighboring&#13;
villages of the targeted villages. The Observatory and the DNSI will also benefit from the&#13;
institutional support component through strengthened capacity in data analysis and a stronger&#13;
poverty monitoring system.&#13;
4.    The first risk is the challenge in building and nurturing a new relationship between&#13;
communities, local authorities and the central Government. The GRIP is the first project which&#13;
explicitly supports a participatory process with targeted communities right from the beginning --&#13;
eliciting their participation in the identification of priorities, involving them in the implementation&#13;
and maintenance of investments responding to those priorities -- and which implicates local&#13;
authorities and technical services in the process. This support at the grassroots level is being&#13;
provided in advance of a national decentralization effort, now being planned and expected to be&#13;
implemented during 1998. Fostering the level of trust required ior this new relationship is part of&#13;
an extended process, supported by the project, which will begin slowly, accelerating with&#13;
experience and demonstrated results. The second risk is the extent to which the Government and&#13;
NGOs can manage to maintain an ongoing dialogue, and their willingness to collaborate and&#13;
compromise in order to implement programs at the community level. This is a new and&#13;
experimental partnership for both, one which will be tested throughout the project life. The&#13;
creation of an Association with beneficiary representatives on its Advisory Board and the&#13;
experience of the pilot phase in testing this partnership on the ground, all augur well for the&#13;
commitment of the two partners to continue this cooperative process. The third risk is linked to&#13;
institutional weaknesses, namely that project implementation may be hampered by limitations on&#13;
technical competence, absorptive capacity, and familiarity wi[th Bank procedures by service&#13;
providers. This concern has been addressed through clear selection criteria (especially of&#13;
intermediaries), inclusion of training to the community, training in community development to&#13;
the NGOS assisting communities during project intervention (NGO-CD) and training to&#13;
intermediaries on Bank procedures, and a system to monitor and evaluate performance outcomes.&#13;
Finally, project achievements may be constrained by difficulty in reaching communities,&#13;
transferring knowledge and improved practices, and sustaining community involvement in&#13;
maintenance of sub-projects. This risk is mitigated by ensuring the presence of an NGO-CD to&#13;
the community throughout the sub-project cycle, assisting comnnunities in defining relevant IEC&#13;
themes, providing appropriate training to respond to these community-identified themes, and&#13;
requiring community contribution to the sub-project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
Environmental Risk:&#13;
5.    The project is classified as category C in view of the size of the sub-projects to be&#13;
financed.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF MALI&#13;
GRASSROOTS INITIATIVES PROJECT&#13;
TO FIGHT HUNGER AND POVERTY&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Mali has requested IDA's assistance in financing a Grassroots&#13;
Initiatives Project to fight hunger and poverty. The main objectives of the proposed project are to:&#13;
(a) improve the living conditions of disadvantaged targeted rural communities by responding to&#13;
their priority needs; (b) strengthen capacity of communities in identififying and ranking their&#13;
development priority needs and in planning, implementing and supervising actions respond to those&#13;
needs, in partnership with NGOs and local authorities; and (c) strengthen institutional and policy-&#13;
making capacity at the local and national level in the fight against hunger and poverty.&#13;
1.2   The proposed Grassroots Initiatives Project to Fight Hunger and Poverty (GRIP) will be&#13;
IDA's first project of its kind in Mali and in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is an experimental intervention&#13;
that aims at strengthening three processes, namely the client consultation process (grassroots&#13;
participation in the decision-making process to fight poverty), the sub-project implementation&#13;
process (collaboration of stakeholders in responding to those needs), and the Government/NGO&#13;
partnership process (complementary roles of each partner to ensure more effective response to the&#13;
constraining effects of hunger and poverty).&#13;
2. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. THE ECONOMY&#13;
2.1    Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world with per capita income estimated at about&#13;
US$240 in 1996. Access to key social services, notably education, basic health, potable water and&#13;
sanitation is limited. Past growth performance was constrained by inappropriate economic policies&#13;
coupled with a long-term decline in competitiveness and terms of trade. Since 1987, the&#13;
Government of Mali has made fundamental changes in its economic development strategy, opting&#13;
for a market-oriented approach in place of the centrally-controlled system that existed before. It has&#13;
put in place important measures to correct distortions in the incentive and regulatory system,&#13;
liberalized domestic marketing and pricing, freed up international trade, and withdrawn from&#13;
participation in key economic sectors in favor of the private sector. It has improved fiscal&#13;
management and is continuing efforts to improve the efficiency of public resource use.&#13;
2.2    Macroeconomic performance in 1996 was impressive and prospects for 1997 are even&#13;
better. In 1996, the economy grew by 4% in real terms, the overall fiscal deficit was reduced to&#13;
7.9% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 10.5% in 1995, while the current account deficit fell&#13;
from 15% to 13.5% of GDP during the same period. Inflation was reduced from 12.4% in 1995 to&#13;
about 6.5%. Economic growth in 1997 was estimated at 6.7%. The reform measures put in place&#13;
and the devaluation of the CFA Franc (CFAF) in 1994, have helped boost Mali's medium-term&#13;
growth prospects. Real growth is projected to average about 5% per annum over the medium term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
allowing per capita income growth of about 2%. Agriculture will continue to be the main sector of&#13;
economic activity, though growth in sectors such as mining, construction, and textile, is expected to&#13;
be significant. The projected growth rates will have to be complemented by policies to help the poor&#13;
benefit from growth in order to achieve the Government's objective of poverty reduction. These&#13;
would include policies to improve access to education and health, support income-generating&#13;
activities, and improve basic rural infrastructure, particularly in disadvantaged rural communities.&#13;
B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL SECTOR PROGRESS&#13;
2.3    During the last ten years, the Government of Mali has gradually shifted public spending to&#13;
primary education and health services, and provided funding for protecting vulnerable groups.&#13;
Poverty is still widespread, however, a fact borne out by the country's extremely poor human&#13;
resource indicators (Annex I contains Selected Poverty/Social Indicators). Recent estimates for 1996&#13;
indicate that over 70% of the 10 million Malians were below the poverty line, many hungry and&#13;
malnourished. Poverty is most prevalent in the rural areas, where 93% of the poor live. There are&#13;
considerable regional disparities in the extent of poverty, with the northern regions generally worse&#13;
off than the southern regions. Mopti persistently ranks as the poorest region in Mali, with 90% of its&#13;
population below the national poverty line, a fact reflected in large number of food-deficit areas,&#13;
poor health status and low education levels. Food absorbs nearly two-thirds of the household budget&#13;
of the poor. Most recent (1995-96) data categorize 33% of Mali's children under 3 years old as&#13;
chronically malnourished. Roughly 49% of Malians have access ito safe water, (based on 20 liters&#13;
per day per person) and about 80% of them lack basic sanitation. In rural areas 70-80% of school-&#13;
age children do not go to primary school. Indeed, Mali is among the five countries in the world with&#13;
the lowest level of adult literacy (31 %) and one of the lowest prirnary education coverage (35% and&#13;
25% for girls), despite an improvement of 10% since 1987. Health coverage is poor, with life&#13;
expectancy of 50 years, and an infant mortality rate of 123 per 1000 live births. The 1997 UNDP&#13;
Human Development Report ranks Mali 171st out of 175 countries in terms of social indicators in&#13;
1994. With rapid population growth at 3.1 % annually, without measures that make use of all&#13;
available resources, conditions will further deteriorate. It should be noted that improving the quality&#13;
of poverty-related information is an essential part of strengthening the poverty monitoring system&#13;
that is being supported by the GRIP.&#13;

Democratization and Decentralization&#13;
2.4    The Government of Mali recognizes that public sector resources alone cannot reduce&#13;
poverty or hunger for its growing population. It acknowledges that Mali's development requires the&#13;
active cooperation of public and private partners to reach its widely diverse and dispersed&#13;
communities. The democratization and decentralization processes are the two most important&#13;
ongoing developments in moving towards greater participation and empowerment of the populations&#13;
at the grassroots level in the fight against poverty. The democratization process began in early 1991&#13;
with the fall of the previous regime. The Government mandated a decentralization reform in&#13;
February 1993 and approved the Code des collectivites territoriales in January 1995.&#13;
Implementation mechanisms have still to be defined, but it is expected that the Government will&#13;
adopt progressive implementation. This reforrn would radically rnodify the decision-making&#13;
development process. Implied in this program is the greater role of civil society in the design and&#13;
implementation of policies and programs. Increased dialogue with the populations is an integral part&#13;
of the decentralization process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
2.5   In the shadow of these developments, a Mali Hunger Workshop, organized by the NGOs in&#13;
coordination with the Govemment and the Bank, was held in June 1995 as a first step in beginning a&#13;
constructive dialogue between the Government, NGOs and Bank, and in moving towards a tripartite&#13;
partnership in the fight against hunger and poverty. The Mali Workshop, instigated by a Bank-&#13;
sponsored World Conference on Hunger in 1993, concluded that the community must be the focus&#13;
of the development process, and that, given the enormous challenge of poverty reduction in Mali&#13;
and the different competencies of each partner, a concerted effort by all partners in development is&#13;
required. To this end, complementary, systemic and institutional relationships need to be explored,&#13;
tested, and in due course, regularized. A tripartite "Steering Committee in the Fight against&#13;
Hunger", comprised of representatives of the Government, NGOs, and development partners, was&#13;
created to foster such experimentation.&#13;
Government Strategy in Poverty-related Sectors&#13;
2.6    The Government is committed to a broad-based strategy to fight the widespread prevalence&#13;
of poverty. Through its macroeconomic and sectoral policies, it is attempting to reach and respond&#13;
to the basic needs of the most vulnerable groups. Key sectoral policies linked to poverty reduction&#13;
are presented below.&#13;
2.7    Health: Government strategy emphasizes the improvement of coverage and quality of&#13;
primary health care services, including nutrition, through the provision of a package of preventive&#13;
and curative services, improved referral services, greater decentralization of the health care system&#13;
and greater community participation in the management and financing of primary health care service&#13;
delivery. Cost-recovery measures have been in place in both the health (visits and medicine) and&#13;
education (school fees, books and supplies) sectors for a number of years. The Government is&#13;
presently preparing a sectoral investment program to ensure greater coherence and coordination&#13;
among different policies and interventions.&#13;
2.8    Education: There are many important innovations occuring in the education sector.&#13;
Teaching in national languages, development of community schools and decentralization all have&#13;
the potential to increase study achievement and access to education. The Government has spent the&#13;
last year developing an ambitious 10 -year sector reform program, which will integrate these&#13;
interventions. Overall sector goals are to expand access to primary education, especially for girls,&#13;
while improving quality at all levels through improved management and use of sector resources;&#13;
enhance the quality and relevance of vocational education by promoting labor skills in line with&#13;
labor market needs and the promotion of private participation in the sector.&#13;
2.9    Agriculture: Despite rapid growth and productivity recorded in agriculture and in livestock&#13;
in the recent past, performance is still limited by the inadequacy of existing technology and&#13;
production systems and rapid degradation of the environment. In 1992, the Government prepared a&#13;
Rural Development Master Plan which sees agriculture as the engine for the country's growth. The&#13;
strategy emphasizes: (i) improved natural resources management to promote sustainable growth,&#13;
relying on greater community participation in the planning stages; (ii) further redistribution of&#13;
responsibilities from the public towards the private sector and rural communities; (iii) restructuring&#13;
the Ministry of Rural Development to increase efficiency; (iv) improved and expanded agricultural&#13;
extension and research services, with special attention to the needs and activities of women.&#13;
2.10   Natural Resources Management: Soil degradation is the greatest threat to sustainable&#13;
agricultural growth. The Government, in line with its decentralization and agriculture policy,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
supports a rational land use system which is expected to halt and eventually reverse the rapid&#13;
process of soil degradation. To this end, it has a community-based natural resources management&#13;
strategy which empowers communities to manage their own natural resources and builds capacity of&#13;
staff at the ministerial level who in turn advise villagers on these rnatters. The experience of the first&#13;
two years in implementing this approach has been positive, especially with regard to strengthening&#13;
community capabilities in collective decision-making.&#13;
2.11   Urban Employment and Local Capacity: Urban population is growing rapidly and with it&#13;
the demand for infrastructure and appropriate services. The Government supported the&#13;
establishment of a quasi-independent entity to respond to such needs, AGETIPE (Public Works&#13;
Executing Agency). The AGETIPE formula has demonstrated it can provide essential public works&#13;
and employment, even if temporary, to urban workers with little or no skills and can strengthen&#13;
capacity of small entrepreneurs in an efficient and timely manner.&#13;
2.12   Water Supply and Sanitation: These sectors are characterized by lack of systematic&#13;
community participation; little or no user contribution to the investment of village water systems; the&#13;
absence of local technical capacity; the ineffectiveness of sanitation and hygiene education&#13;
programs; and the total dependence on external resources. The Gcvernment's strategy in the rural&#13;
water supply and sanitation sectors is to maximize the impact of existing safe supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities and to ensure that the future development of the water and sanitation sectors will respond to&#13;
the demands of the population. The basic principles underpinning the strategy are: (i)&#13;
decentralization and beneficiary involvement in the decision-making process at all stages of the rural&#13;
water supply and sanitation project cycle; (ii) financial participation of communities toward initial&#13;
investment costs, based on their willingness to pay for a given level of service, and total community&#13;
responsibility for operating costs and maintenance; (iii) reduction of construction and maintenance&#13;
costs; (iv) systematic recourse to NGOs and private sector for construction, maintenance, and&#13;
operation of rural facilities, with emphasis on promotion of local capabilities and contractors; and&#13;
(v) improvement of hygiene.&#13;
2.13   Food Security: A national food stock program, designed by the Government and donors&#13;
under the Cereal Marketing Rehabilitation Program (PRMC) and managed by Office des Produits&#13;
Agricoles au Mali (OPAM), functions well. OPAM also distributes emergency food aid to targeted&#13;
populations, based on a monthly emergency food aid plan that relies on closely-monitored indicators&#13;
from the Marketing Information System (SIM) and the Early Warning System (SAP). The National&#13;
Agricultural Extension Program (PNVA), which aims at increasing agricultural productivity and&#13;
farmers' income through a "train and visit" approach, responds more directly to long-term food&#13;
security issues. It puts particular emphasis on labor-intensive agricultural techniques, on women&#13;
concerns, and on cultural practices.&#13;
D. ROLE OF THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATI:ONS (NGOs) SECTOR&#13;
2.14   Over 600 international and national NGOs engage in a wide range of relief, development&#13;
and policy-related activities. These numbers have grown rapidly since 1988, with many&#13;
organizations having less than five years experience in implementation or financial and project&#13;
management. It is generally acknowledged that roughly 150 NGOs are truly viable with proven&#13;
performance in food assistance, natural resources management, health, education, community&#13;
infrastructure, community organization and information. Increasingly better organized on specific&#13;
sectoral issues, their energy, extensive outreach capabilities and participatory experience are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
indispensable assets in achieving poverty and hunger reduction, in line with Government goals and&#13;
in harmony with its strategy and programs.&#13;
2.15   The relationship between NGOs and Government, defined under a 1959 law for the creation&#13;
of associations, has in practice been ad hoc, with mixed results and misperceptions on both sides. In&#13;
part this is because the role of NGOs participating in the new democratic society of Mali is evolving,&#13;
and the types of NGOS are growing at an accelerated pace since the end of the previous regime.&#13;
Some NGOs function as resource intermediaries, with or without specific policy, technical&#13;
assistance, and targeted intervention agendas. Others have modest human and financial resources,&#13;
excellent knowledge of local culture and conditions, are focused on a geographic area, ethnic or&#13;
religious group, or a specific sector issue. The Bank's NGO Capacity Assessment (October 1995),&#13;
which was commissioned as part of project preparation, reflects the varying character, experience&#13;
and capacity of 60 key NGOs operating in Mali, their constraints and perceptions of the working&#13;
environment, and prospects for successful tripartite collaboration with a Bank financed mechanism&#13;
(Annex II contains a Summary of the NGO Capacity Assessment). Malian NGOs have been trying&#13;
to modify the 1959 law governing them and their relations with Government since 1986. In 1996,&#13;
the Government agreed to consider amendments to the law and requested a draft text to be prepared.&#13;
In view of the proposed project's hope to foster Government/NGO partnership, the project will&#13;
support the dialogue between Government and NGOs in improving the legal framework under&#13;
which the NGOs operate in Mali.&#13;
E. LESSONS LEARNED FROM IDA's EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.16   Activities in health, education, agriculture, natural resources management, urban services,&#13;
and water supply provide relevant lessons for the project. Key lessons learned from Bank&#13;
operational experience with participatory approaches (Annex III) suggest:&#13;
*  need for community participation: community participation throughout the project cycle&#13;
fosters a greater sense of ownership and increases the chances for sustainable interventions.&#13;
It often enhances project design and improves trust among different stakeholders (the&#13;
Natural Resources Management Project (NRMP) and the Program for the Consolidation of&#13;
Farmers' Associations (PCAP) in Mali and the Program for Alleviation of Poverty and&#13;
Social Costs of Adjustment Project (PAPSCA) in Uganda);&#13;
*  community contribution:  mechanisms for community participation and beneficiary&#13;
contribution in project need to be designed in consultation with communities (10-25%&#13;
contribution appears feasible, depending on type of sub-project (NRMP, PCAP, Rural Water&#13;
Supply Project (RWSP));&#13;
*  sub-project maintenance: responsibility of maintenance clearly rests with beneficiaries;&#13;
agreement on this should be obtained with the community before sub-project selection, and&#13;
should be officialized in a contract between the community and the project implementation&#13;
agency. Training of beneficiaries in maintenance activities should be included in project to&#13;
assure sustainability of sub-project infrastructure (RWSP, PCAP, Village Infrastructure&#13;
Project (VIP) in Indonesia). In general, this task is assumed by a community management&#13;
committee organized at the beginning of micro-project preparation (NRMP);&#13;
*  manual of procedures: this manual, which establishes a clear and flexible framework for&#13;
project implementation, is a valuable instrument to ensure transparency. Procurement&#13;
procedures should be kept simple and avoid heavy bureaucracy (AGETIPE, NRMP, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Fund of Social Action for Family Education (FASEF) under the Population, Health and&#13;
Rural Water Supply Project, PAPSCA in Uganda, as well as in other countries ("World&#13;
Bank-Financed Projects with Community Participation" World Bank Discussion Paper No.&#13;
265).&#13;
*  avoiding duplication: village sub-project proposals need to be submitted at sub-regional&#13;
level for harmonization with regional development programs (NRMP, PCAP, VIP);&#13;
*  role of NGOs: the need for pre-qualification and selection procedures for NGOs on a&#13;
competitive basis (criteria to be clearly defined in the Manual of Procedures)to participate in&#13;
the project (Health Services Development Project, AGETIPE, PAPSCA, Grassroots&#13;
Iniativies Project in Togo);&#13;
*  monitoring system: project with significant community contribution should have in-built&#13;
monitoring system to assess community views on the efficiency of implementation and&#13;
project impact, and to allow timely modifications to project design (NRMP, PAPSCA, Aga&#13;
Khan Rural Support Program in Pakistan).&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVENMENT&#13;
2.17   The objectives of the proposed project are consistent with the development strategy of the&#13;
World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali, presented to the Board in February&#13;
1995, and that of the upcoming CAS under preparation (particularly its poverty focus), as well as&#13;
with the recommendations of the Evaluation of Living Conditions of June 1993. IDA's strategy to&#13;
assist Mali aims to achieve sustainable economic growth with equity and targeted poverty reduction.&#13;
Its central focus is: (a) to promote competitiveness in order to make the economy more responsive&#13;
and to create more opportunities for the private sector; (b) to complete structural reforms in&#13;
agriculture; and (c) to develop human resources by delivering essential services efficiently and&#13;
effectively. The CAS also advocates the strengthening of social safety net programs for the poor that&#13;
respond to basic needs and human resource development. Moreover, a central aspect of the Bank's&#13;
partnership with Mali, as endorsed in both the CAS and the Evaluation of Living Conditions, is the&#13;
strengthening of the quality of the dialogue with Government and civil society to enhance&#13;
participation and to facilitate internalization and ownership. The June 1995 Hunger Workshop in&#13;
Mali confirmed these findings and participatory approach. The proposed intervention is considered&#13;
a priority project in terms of its poverty-targeted interventions and its long-term focus on capacity&#13;
building and community ownership. It has drawn from lessons learned from similar projects, listed&#13;
above.&#13;
2.18  IDA is well positioned to support a broad-based poverty alleviation strategy because it&#13;
operates throughout Mali and has gained extensive experience from ongoing operations in natural&#13;
resources management, health, rural water supply, and education. The project will ensure linkages&#13;
with these operations. The categories of project interventions (health, agriculture, education, potable&#13;
water), reflect the combined best judgment of Government, NGOs and the Bank as to where poverty&#13;
is most likely to be improved on a sustainable basis, with a demand-driven, community-based&#13;
program. The Bank facilitates cooperation between NGOs and Government through its financial&#13;
resources and technical expertise in developing community participation projects, and by supporting&#13;
donor coordination in the program to fight poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN&#13;
3.1    The proposed project is a pilot operation that will test innovative participatory approaches to&#13;
tackle poverty in Mali. Its development objectives are:&#13;
*  to improve the living conditions of disadvantaged targeted rural communities by responding&#13;
to their priority needs;&#13;
*  to strengthen capacity of communities in identifying and ranking their development priority&#13;
needs and in planning, implementing and supervising actions to respond to those needs, in&#13;
partnership with NGOs and local authorities;&#13;
*  to strengthen institutional and policy-making capacity at the local and national levels in the&#13;
fight against hunger and poverty.&#13;
3.2    The proposed project is based on a set of guiding principles, namely that (a) a community&#13;
participatory approach is essential for sustainability in the fight against hunger and poverty; (b)&#13;
deepening the Malian Government/NGO partnership and community involvement is potentially&#13;
helpful in achieving the project objectives; (c) capacity building efforts must center around the&#13;
community, with efforts of other partners involved in project implementation; and (d) the&#13;
development impact of the project will be measured in terms of both process and performance&#13;
indicators.&#13;
3.3    The project reflects an iterative dialogue with beneficiaries, service providers and other key&#13;
stakeholders to address three complementary, inter-linked processes namely: (a) a community&#13;
participation process; (b) a sub-project implementation process; and (c) a GovernmentlNGO&#13;
partnership process. Annex IV presents the project's logical framework.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4    The project has two components: (a) community development; and (b) policy and&#13;
institutional support to strengthen local and national decision-making on poverty issues.&#13;
Community Development&#13;
3.5    The community development component comprises of (i) community-requested&#13;
infrastructure in targeted rural communities, and (ii) accompanying local capacity building measures&#13;
to strenghten community development skills, IEC messages for behavior change, and relevant&#13;
training to ensure project sustainability and effective service delivery. The project will finance&#13;
priority community infrastructure identified by the beneficiaries themselves in a number of sectors,&#13;
including water supply, education, health, and rural development (pilot phase experience indicates&#13;
that top priorities are wells, schools and land preparation for horticulture) (para. 3.12). Local&#13;
capacity building activities, envisaged throughout the project's presence in a community, will&#13;
involve key project stakeholders, especially communities. They will include: (i) training for the&#13;
community, NGOs recruited for community development activities, for intermediaries, and, where&#13;
appropriate, for local technical services, (ii) an Information, Education, Communication (IEC)&#13;
program tailored to community needs; and (iii) an information campaign to keep the public and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
interested partners abreast of project development, to share similar experiences, and to find solutions&#13;
to implementation problems.&#13;
3.6    The community participation process, starting with a participatory needs assessment, forms&#13;
the basis for the community development component, and is the anchor for the project. Beneficiary&#13;
communities will play a central role in the decision-making process throughout project intervention,&#13;
from identification through supervision of sub-project components. This will be done through a&#13;
community management committee which will lead and coordinate all activities at the community&#13;
level. The following steps/activities describe the iterative dialogue with key stakeholders under the&#13;
community development component:&#13;
targeting/selecting communities: The project will intervene in the region of Mopti and&#13;
other regions in a phased manner. It will focus its operaltions in the region of Mopti for the&#13;
first year, extending to a second region in the second year and to a third region in the third&#13;
year, as appropriate. Depending on the level of available information, thearrondissements&#13;
(the lowest administrative level in a region) will be classified by a composite index,&#13;
comprising of the revenue level, food security, access to water, health indicators, and&#13;
education/literacy rates (data will be provided by the Systeme d'Alerte Precoce (SAP) and&#13;
the National Statistical Office (DNSI)). The classification of villages within the selected&#13;
arrondissements will be based on the existence of socio-economic infrastructure. Details of&#13;
the targeting system are presented in the Manual of Procedures. A given number of the&#13;
poorest villages will be asked to express their interest and "demand" for Project financing.&#13;
Those indicating an interest will be classified according to evaluation criteria and a number&#13;
of them will receive financing based on the project's annual program.&#13;
delegating management of sub-project activities: Once communities have been selected for&#13;
Project financing, an intermediary will be contracted by the Project Management Office to&#13;
manage a batch of sub-projects in a number of the communities. This intermediary will be&#13;
an NGO or firm with a proven record in community development, strong managerial and&#13;
financial capacity, and physical presence in the area of intervention.&#13;
sensitizing/mobilizing selected communities: An NGO specializing in community&#13;
development (NGO-CD) will be recruited by the intermediary to implement capacity&#13;
building activities and facilitate/coordinate sub-project activities. The NGO-CD will place&#13;
and supervise a Community Development Agent (CDA) in the community throughout the&#13;
GRIP's intervention in the community. The continuous presence of the CDA in the&#13;
community will increase understanding of village life and permit direct contact to the project&#13;
for community members. The CDA's main tasks will be to sensitize villagers on the&#13;
Project, assist in the participatory needs assessment to identify community priorities,&#13;
facilitate the organization of a village management commiittee, assist in preparing sub-&#13;
project proposals, support the community in the bidding and selection process of enterprises,&#13;
assist it in negotiating and mobilizing its contribution to the sub-project, help in identifying&#13;
appropriate IEC themes, plan and implement IEC activities, and train a village animation&#13;
agent in these activities. Strong emphasis will be placed on including women in the village&#13;
management committee (the key decision-making body at the community level), and on&#13;
giving preference to women as animation agents.&#13;
identifying community priority needs and preparing sub-project proposal: The&#13;
participatory needs assessment, a key step in the community development process, will put&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
strong emphasis on getting the views of all segments of the community, particularly women,&#13;
on identifying community priorities and responding to them. These priorities will be&#13;
validated with the Local Development Committees (CLD) to ensure consistency with&#13;
national/regional programs and to avoid duplication. With the assistance of the CDA, the&#13;
community will set up or strengthen a village management committee, that will be the key&#13;
decision-maker during sub-project implementation (e.g. the preparation of sub-project&#13;
proposals, participation in the economic feasibility of the sub-project, definition of&#13;
community contribution (labor and/or materials) to the sub-project, the selection of&#13;
enterprises and service providers and signing contracts with them) and follow-up (especially&#13;
maintenance activities). (Annex V describes a participatory methodology to be tested during&#13;
the project.)&#13;
implementing sub-project activities: When a community's proposal is approved for&#13;
financing, the community and the intermediary will contract an enterprise to carry out the&#13;
infrastructure works and recruit a supervising engineer to ensure technical quality. The&#13;
execution of the works will be coordinated with regional technical services to ensure&#13;
consistency with standards and quality control. At this time, the CDA will also work with&#13;
the community, particularly with women groups, to identify community IEC themes that are&#13;
relevant to their needs and implement the program. Existing IEC materials and approaches&#13;
drawn from similar community level interventions will be used to the extent possible and&#13;
will serve as tools in IEC training. (Annex VI describes the IEC program.)&#13;
training of key stakeholders: Training will take place at different times during project&#13;
implementation and will include: (i) training at the village level in functional literacy and&#13;
basic management and financial skills for village management committee members, in&#13;
community development for the village animation agent, and in infrastructure maintenance&#13;
for selected village members; (ii) training for CDAs in community development, preparation&#13;
of technical proposals, gender in development, and IEC and facilitation techniques; (iii)&#13;
training in participatory methods/tools for the NGO-CD and CDA; and (iv) training for&#13;
NGO-CDs and intermediaries in the project's participatory monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system. The training of a village animation agent in community development skills is&#13;
envisaged as a way of ensuring sustainability of capacity building efforts, once the GRIP&#13;
leaves the village. Representatives of local technical services will also participate in certain&#13;
training sessions, as appropriate. The project will also provide training in financial/technical&#13;
areas related to the Project to those NGOs who submit proposals but are not selected as&#13;
either intermediaries or service providers. Training will encompass a wide range of&#13;
methodologies, techniques and materials (workshops, focus groups, mass media and local&#13;
IEC message delivery. (Annex VII discusses the training program.)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E): The project's M&amp;E system relies on a participatory&#13;
approach built on a common vision of project performance among key stakeholders (Section&#13;
5). To this end, project results will be presented regularly to beneficiaries, partners involved&#13;
in project implementation, administrative authorities and relevant CLDs and technical&#13;
services staff, with the aim of sharing experiences, receiving feedback on any&#13;
problem/conflict, and finding possible solutions.&#13;
3.7    The GRIP will finance grants for sub-projects (works) and equipment linked to the&#13;
community-requested infrastructure, consultant services for capacity building activities, the&#13;
intermediary role and surveys/studies. The pilot phase experience indicated that sub-project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
preparation required about one year, infrastructure construction about 6-8 months, and capacity&#13;
building activities about one year. Given these factors and the amount of available resources, it is&#13;
estimated that about 260 multi-sectoral sub-projects will be financed under the 5-year life of the&#13;
project: 30 the first year, 55, 80 and 95 in the following three years; no sub-project will be&#13;
committed in the last year, given the length of a sub-project cycle. It is expected that, with&#13;
experience, sub-projects will be processed more quickly and a greater number of them can be&#13;
supervised during a given period.&#13;
Policy and Institutional Development&#13;
3.8    The objectives of this component are to strengthen the efficiency of decision-makers at the&#13;
national level by improving the quality and relevance of integrated poverty data and data analysis,&#13;
and to support Government/NGO partnership at the national level. These objectives are to be&#13;
achieved principally by (i) support to the Observatory for Sustainable Human Development; and (ii)&#13;
support to the poverty monitoring system.&#13;
3.9    Support to the Observatoryfor Sustainable Human Development: The Observatory was&#13;
created in October 1996 under the Planning Commission (now under the Ministry of Economy, Plan&#13;
and Integration) to analyze existing socio-economic data and provide policy recommendations on&#13;
poverty-related issues. (Annex VIII provides a description of the Observatory). Specifically, the&#13;
Observatory will provide policy-makers with relevant information on (a) living conditions trends,&#13;
particularly poverty and social development indicators; (b) the impact of policies, programs and&#13;
projects related to the fight against poverty on vulnerable groups; and (c) ways to improve targeting&#13;
and planning of poverty-related policies and programs, in particular using techniques of the&#13;
Geographical Information System (GIS). It will produce an annual Report on Human Development,&#13;
which will present a diagnostic of the socio-economic situation and an analysis of policies and&#13;
recommendations on selected poverty issues. A study program will be reviewed annually or as&#13;
appropriate. In addition, the Observatory will strengthen the links between policy-makers and data&#13;
producers, relying on technical ministries, Malian research centers, NGOs, bilateral and multilateral&#13;
agencies and other actors, as appropriate. In this regard, the Observatory will work in close&#13;
collaboration with the National Statistical Office (DNSI). The project will equip the Observatory&#13;
and finance its program of activities, including the production and dissemination of the annual&#13;
report. The UNDP, which has participated in the appraisal of this component, will provide parallel&#13;
financing for the functioning of the Observatory.&#13;
3.10   Support to the poverty monitoring system. The Government of Mali, under the supervision&#13;
of the DNSI, began setting up a permanent monitoring system of living conditions under the&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program, with the help of the Bank, the European Union and the UNDP. The&#13;
system attempts to integrate information from different sources, particularly household budget&#13;
surveys (1988/89 and 1994), other multi sectoral surveys (e.g., the demographic and health survey&#13;
1996), and statistics collected by sectoral ministries. To deepen and continue these efforts, the&#13;
project will finance a national household survey around 1999. The r esults of this work will&#13;
contribute to the monitoring of poverty trends and the analytical work of the Observatory. The&#13;
project will also support the 1998 population census by financing a part of the cartography exercise&#13;
(carried out during project preparation), and data collection. Despilte the financial support of other&#13;
donors, a financing gap to carry out the census exists and the Government has requested IDA, as the&#13;
lender of last resort, to fill this gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
C. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.11   Project preparation has been carried out in a participatory manner with the Steering&#13;
Committee to Fight Hunger established in June 1995 (composed of Government and NGO&#13;
representatives) under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office. A Project Preparation Workshop&#13;
(using the ZOPP methodology) was held with all Committee members in October 1995. Agreement&#13;
was reached on project and long-term objectives, components, and a tentative plan of operations.&#13;
The participants of the Project Preparation Workshop emphasized the importance of increasing&#13;
community participation, of strengthening local capacity, of improving the quality of community&#13;
decision-making, and of ensuring community involvement in maintenance of sub-projects. The&#13;
results of that Workshop laid the groundwork for project preparation.&#13;
3.12   To test the institutional and organizational aspects of the project, a pilot phase was carried&#13;
out in the region of Mopti. A participatory needs assessment was carried out by a Malian NGO to&#13;
ascertain the priority needs of 31 communities in six cercles of the region and to identify the&#13;
NGOs/public agencies intervening in the villages. Pilot activities have been financed for 10 villages,&#13;
including four schools (three classrooms and latrines), five land preparation projects (including a&#13;
small dam and horticultural plots), and one feeder road. In each pilot village, a management&#13;
committee (or a parent/student association for the schools) has been put in place and functional&#13;
literacy training has been provided to committee members, as well as other villagers. IEC messages&#13;
linked to village needs have also been delivered. These activities have been implemented by local&#13;
contractors, local NGOs and supervised by three intermediaries (NGOs).&#13;
3.13   An evaluation of the pilot phase was conducted to assess the viability of project design,&#13;
implementation procedures, and institutional arrangements and to make adjustments as warranted.&#13;
In general, the evaluation found that (i) pilot activities reflected the priorities of the community; (ii)&#13;
the benefits of each activity extended beyond the village boundaries to at least three neighboring&#13;
villages, reaching about 20,000 persons; and (iii) the participatory and consultative processes&#13;
contributed to confidence-building and engendered a sense of partnership at the local level among&#13;
communities, authorities, technical services, and other partners. Project design has been modified to&#13;
reflect the lessons learned from the pilot phase, especially in regard to (i) increased community&#13;
participation by reinforcing the decision-making responsibilities of the community throughout&#13;
project intervention; (ii) local capacity building by making the village the focal point (e.g.,&#13;
organization of village management committee, training of village animation agents in community&#13;
development skills, adoption of a gender action plan for the village) and by intensifying training for&#13;
project stakeholders; (iii) simplified implementation procedures by standardizing bidding&#13;
documents, simplifying contracts and limiting the number of sub-project accounts required by the&#13;
intermediary; (iv) maximization of sub-project impact in a community by increasing the number of&#13;
interventions within a selected village, giving preference to sub-projects that have over-spilling&#13;
effects into neighboring villages; (v) lowering administrative costs by reducing dispersion of sub-&#13;
projects in a given area and opting to concentrate in one region for the first year of the project; and&#13;
(vi) adopting an "associative" institutional framework that promotes the tri-partite partnership&#13;
between communities, Government and NGOs. The pilot phase experience has also shown that&#13;
while sub-projects related to land preparation offer the best opportunities for increasing income, they&#13;
require substantial capacity building measures, particularly related to maintenance and management,&#13;
which the project will provide. The problem of sustainability of schools (the issue of recurrent&#13;
costs) also requires close monitoring and coordination with regional technical services. The&#13;
recurrent cost implications have been discussed with the education sector officials and will be&#13;
monitored under provisions of the Education Sector Investment Program, currently under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
preparation. The financing of teachers for the new schools will come under Government's new&#13;
teacher contract policy.&#13;
3.14   The pilot phase included (i) the opening of a roster of NGOs which could serve either as&#13;
intermediaries or service providers; (ii) the preparation and testing of a training module in&#13;
communication techniques; (iii) the completion of an inventory of IEC materials; (iv) a pilot phase&#13;
launch workshop in Mopti with key regional partners (regional/local administrations, technical&#13;
services, NGOs, donors) to present the project, exchange experiences on approaches and&#13;
implementing issues (e.g., community contribution); (v) elaboration of the project's monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system.&#13;
3.15   Other activities included: (i) the cartography exercise for the planned 1998 population&#13;
census, which provides a detailed inventory of physical and social infrastructure in all villages in&#13;
Mali (regional poverty maps), to be used for the targeting of beneficiary communities; (ii) a&#13;
participatory needs assessment in the two remaining cercles of Mopti. (Youvarou and Tenenkou) to&#13;
prepare for the next batch of sub-projects; (iii) drafting of the Observatory's first annual report.&#13;
3.16   A person responsible to manage the pilot phase and other preparatory activities, an&#13;
accountant, and a specialist in monitoring and evaluation have been recruited, as consultants.&#13;
Project preparatory activities have been financed by a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$ 1.4&#13;
million and a US$600,0000 grant from the Japanese PHRD Trust Fund. The first participatory&#13;
assessment and the NGO capacity study were financed by the Client Consultation Fund, the second&#13;
participatory assessment and the inventory of IEC materials by FIAHS funds, the Project&#13;
Preparation Workshop by the Dutch Trust Fund for poverty, and part of the office equipment of the&#13;
Observatory by the Finnish Trust Fund.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.17   Total costs for the proposed project, excluding customs but including local taxes, are&#13;
estimated at US$23.0 million. Base costs are estimated at US$20.5 million equivalent, and total&#13;
contingencies amount to US$2.5million equivalent (10.9% of total project costs). Foreign exchange&#13;
would account for US$9.2 million, or 40% of total project costs. (.Detailed cost tables are presented&#13;
in Annex IX.)&#13;
3.18   Physical contingencies have been calculated at 5% for equipment, vehicles and materials.&#13;
The following price contingencies have been included: (i) on foreign exchange expenditures 2.5%&#13;
for 1998, 3.1% for 1999, 2.9% for 2000, 2.8% for 2001, 2.7% for 2002, and 2.6% per annum&#13;
thereafter, and (ii) on local cost expenditures 2.5% from 1998 onwards.&#13;
3.19   Project costs by component, free of taxes and duties, are shown in Table 1. Community&#13;
development, including community-requested interventions and capacity building account for 76%&#13;
of base costs, the institutional support component 11% and operating costs 7%.&#13;

Financing&#13;
3.20   Of the US$23.0 million total project costs, IDA would finance US$21.5 million equivalent,&#13;
or 93% of total project costs, for the community development, policy and institutional development,&#13;
and operating costs (Table 2). The Government is expected to contribute US$1.5 million equivalent,&#13;
or 7% of total project costs, to cover a portion of grants for the community development component.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1    Overall Project monitoring will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy, Plan and&#13;
Integration. The Government of Mali has designated the newly-created Association d'Appui aux&#13;
Initiatives de Base (AIB) as the executing entity for the community development component of this&#13;
Project. Prior to negotiations, it will adopt the Statute of the AIB. ]Further, the signing of the draft&#13;
Convention between the AIB and the Government of Mali will be a condition of Credit effectiveness&#13;
(para. 7.2a). The AIB will be composed of an Advisory Board ancl a Project Management Office&#13;
(PMO).&#13;
4.2    The Advisory Board, composed of representatives of beneficiary communities and civil&#13;
society (representatives of other organisms may be invited as observers, when deemed necessary),&#13;
will serve principally an overall supervisory function, delegating operational responsibilities to the&#13;
Project Management Office, its technical and administrative arm. ][ts specific role will be to review&#13;
and modify the Manual of Procedures, as necessary, in agreement with IDA, approve the annual&#13;
work program and annual budget of the Project Management Office, ensure the preparation of&#13;
annual project reviews, and evaluate project management a posteriori, based on quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports and audit reports. It will be informed of sub-projects and, as necessary will have&#13;
representatives of key sectoral line ministries to ensure further coherence with quality and&#13;
maintenance standards during its regular meetings.&#13;
4.3   The Project Management Office will be responsible for managing the project within the&#13;
policy framework determined by the Advisory Board. This means the selection of sub-projects, the&#13;
recruitment of intermediaries and/or service providers of the selected sub-projects, the overall&#13;
technical supervision of sub-projects, provision of training, as required, and monitoring aggregate&#13;
project results. The PMO will be guided by a detailed Manual of Procedures (Annex X), which&#13;
defines criteria for geographic targeting, selection criteria for sub-projects and of partners involved&#13;
in implementation, outlines detailed procedures of project implementation, including model bidding&#13;
documents and sample contracts, and presents monitoring procedures and performance indicators.&#13;
The Manual of Procedures was finalized during negotiations (para. 7. la). A Project Implementation&#13;
Structure is presented in Annex XI.&#13;
4.4    The PMO will ensure broad dissemination of information on the Project, in the communities&#13;
selected for project intervention (to be proposed by the PMO and agreed upon by the Board) and to&#13;
the relevant regional and local authorities. It will ensure that participatory assessments will be&#13;
carried out by qualified NGOs/consultants to identify community priority needs and that the&#13;
economic feasibility studies of sub-projects will be developed with the help of qualified consultants&#13;
and local public technical services. Community sub-project proposals will be verified with local&#13;
authorities, namely the CRDs, CLDs, and the communes (when they are put in place) to ensure&#13;
consistency with national and sectoral policies and regional programs. In general, the PMO will&#13;
evaluate community requests, based on criteria defined in the Manual of Procedures, approve sub-&#13;
projects and inform the Advisory Board. A sub-project agreement defining the participation of the&#13;
beneficiary in the implementation and follow-up of the sub-project will be signed between the&#13;
community, the intermediary and the PMO, with the endorsement of the CLD. This agreement&#13;
would provide greater assurance that the desired impact of the sub-project is attained and that the&#13;
sub-project will be sustained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
4.5    For programming purposes, the Board will agree upon batches of sub-projects on an annual&#13;
basis. These lists of sub-projects will be sent to IDA for non-objection, as will sub-projects whose&#13;
infrastructure component exceeds an amount of US$ 100,000 equivalent. To facilitate the&#13;
preparation of the next round of sub-project implementation, during negotiations, the Governrmern&#13;
submitted a roster of eligible intermediaries acceptable to IDA (para. 7. Ic) and proposed the zon-es&#13;
of intervention for the first year ofproject implementation (para. 7. 1f).&#13;
4.6    The PMO will be based in Bamako during the first year of project implementation. This&#13;
arrangement will be reviewed at the end of the first year and modified, as necessary. The PMO will&#13;
be composed of a Director General, an accountant, three technical specialists (civil engineer,&#13;
community development expert, and a monitoring and evaluation specialist). During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were given that the Government of Mali will agree that at all times the Director General&#13;
of the Project Management Office will be acceptable to IDA (para. 7. 1g). The recruitment of the&#13;
Director General and the head of the administrative/financial unit of the PMO is a condition of&#13;
Credit effectiveness (para. 7.2b).&#13;
4.7    For the community development component, project implementation will involve the&#13;
beneficiary community and the intermediary, who delegates sub-project implementation to&#13;
enterprises and consultants. The beneficiary community is the focal point of the decision-making&#13;
process in the community development component.  With the assistance of the community&#13;
development agent and the intermediary, it will be responsible for (i) putting in place a community&#13;
management committee; (ii) identifying a priority sub-project, evaluating its economic feasibility&#13;
and preparing a proposal for financing in a participatory manner; (iii) ensuring its contribution to the&#13;
sub-project; (iv) participating in the recruitment of the contractor of works and the supervising&#13;
engineer; (v) participating in capacity building activities (including IEC); (vi) monitoring and&#13;
evaluating the output and impact of the sub-project. The PMO will contract out batches of sub-&#13;
projects to intermediaries (NGOs with strong managerial, financial and technical skills, or other&#13;
entities experienced in delegated contract management). Each sub-project is a package of activities&#13;
(infrastructure construction, works supervision, and capacity building activities). Intermediaries will&#13;
in turn be responsible to manage the implementation of sub-projects through contractual agreements&#13;
with service providers, such as local entrepreneurs, NGOs, and/or consultants; supervise all works&#13;
and services for technical quality; and ensure monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects, including&#13;
performance indicators. They will provide quarterly progress implementation reports to the PMO.&#13;
4.8    Using an intermediary under this project is considered necessary given the large number of&#13;
small contracts to manage in remote areas of Mali and as a way to ensure quick payment of works&#13;
and services. The rationale for relying principally on NGOs as an intermediary lies in the&#13;
experience of NGOs in community development, their capacity to reach populations at the&#13;
grassroots level, and the likelihood that they will remain in the area of intervention. Intermediaries&#13;
and service providers will be hired based on their competence, capacity, efficiency, and experience&#13;
in responding to community needs. The PMO will maintain an open roster of NGOs, consultants,&#13;
entrepreneurs who have expressed an interest in participating in the project either as intermediaries&#13;
or service providers. The PMO will also ensure the provision of necessary training to groups&#13;
involved in project implementation.&#13;
4.9    As to the policy and institutional development component, the Observatory for Sustainab le&#13;
Human Development, under the aegis of the Ministry of Economy, Plan and Integration, will bne&#13;
responsible to carry out its annual work program, as agreed between the Government, the UNDP&#13;
and IDA. The National Statistical Division (DNSI) will be responsible for the household budget&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
survey and the population census, while the PMO will approve all expenditures based on an agreed&#13;
upon budget with IDA.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.10   The Malian procurement code was revised in 1995 in consultation with the Bank and is&#13;
generally sound. In general, Mali's procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents&#13;
for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Mali allows IDA procedures to take precedence&#13;
over any contrary provisions in local regulations. IDA-financed Works and Goods will be procured&#13;
in accordance with Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised in&#13;
January and August 1996). National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with Mali's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA provided&#13;
that: (i) any bidder is given sufficient time to submit bids (three to fbur weeks); (ii) bid evaluation&#13;
and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no preference margin is&#13;
granted to domestic manufacturers; (iv) eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (v)&#13;
award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (vi) prior to issuing the first call for bids,&#13;
draft standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable. Consultant Services&#13;
contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the&#13;
Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrower published in January 1997.&#13;
4.11   The project will finance: (i) community-based civil works (US$ 1 1.0 million); (ii)&#13;
equipment, vehicles for the community-requested sub-projects, for ihe institutional and policy&#13;
component and for the PMO (US$1.6 million); (iii) service contracts for community development&#13;
services (US$ 1.1 million); consultant services, including work supervision, intermediaries and other&#13;
technical assistance (6.6 million); and (iv) operating costs for the PMO0 (US$ 1.3 million). Table 3&#13;
below summarizes the program elements by procurement category, their estimated costs and&#13;
procurement methods. Detailed procurement arrangements and plans for civil works, goods and&#13;
services to be procured during the first two years of project implementation are presented in Annex&#13;
XVI.&#13;

4.12      Civil Works and Goods. The majority of IDA-financed activities financed under the&#13;
Credit will be used to procure Civil Works, and Goods under NCB procedures. Because of the the&#13;
nature of investments which are small and scattered geographically, it is not expected to use ICB&#13;
procedures. Standard Bidding Documents to be used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will&#13;
be reviewed by IDA during negotiations.&#13;
4.13    Civil Works. Procurement arrangements for civil works, based on National Competitive&#13;
Bidding will amount to US$9.1 million equivalent. These works will be of a scale such that they&#13;
will not attract foreign contractors.&#13;
4.14    Contractsfor small works, estimated to cost less than US$30,000 per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.4 million, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors invited to bid&#13;
by way of discounts either on the total price or on the unit prices. The invitation shall include&#13;
reference unit prices established by an engineer, a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the&#13;
lowest price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates that he has the experience&#13;
and resources to complete the contract successfully.&#13;
4.15   Contracts for goods. Equipment, vehicles and materials will be grouped into bid packages&#13;
and those in excess of US$100,000 equivalent, if any, will be awarded on the basis of international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB), using World Bank standard bidding documents for Procurement of&#13;
Goods (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996), althouglh none are expected. NCB,&#13;
using procedures which have been found acceptable to IDA, would be used for procurement&#13;
involving contracts lower than US$100,000 equivalent but greater thlan US$30,000 equivalent, up to&#13;
a total of US$0.5 million equivalent over the life of the Project. Small quantities of goods such as&#13;
office supplies, consumable materials and spare parts, which are normally available off-the shelf at&#13;
economical prices and cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$30,000, would be procured&#13;
through prudent national shopping, based on price quotations obtained from at least three reliable&#13;
suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed US$ 1,000,000 over the life of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.16   Service delivery contracts. For the provision of service delivery contracts, procurement&#13;
procedures will be consistent with World Bank Guidelines for Consultant Services. It will represent&#13;
about 70-100 contracts (each averaging US$ 17,000) for community development services. The&#13;
procurement procedure for service providers of community development services will be done on&#13;
the basis of short-lists comprising only national consultants following local advertisements to get&#13;
expression of interest. Consultants meeting qualification/registration requirements would be invited&#13;
to bid and deliver services under the supervision of the intermediary. Those expected to bid for&#13;
community development services include primarily community groups (such as NGOs and&#13;
community/village associations).&#13;
4.17   Consultant Services will be procured according to IDA guidelines outlined in the&#13;
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997).&#13;
Consulting services financed by IDA will be normally selected through competition among qualified&#13;
short-listed firms in which the selection will be based on Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)&#13;
by evaluating the quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of services to be provided. For&#13;
audits of a standard nature, the Least-Cost Selection will be the most appropriate method -- the firm&#13;
with the lowest price will be selected, provided its technical proposal received the minimum score.&#13;
For the services of intermediaries, about 25 contracts, each averaging US$60,000, are expected --&#13;
procurement procedures by which the PMO will select intermediaries and award contracts are&#13;
simplified procedures consistent with the World Bank Guidelines for Consultant Services, and&#13;
outlined in details in the Manual of Procedures. Given the specific nature of these activities,&#13;
contracts will be awarded to organizations or consultants satisfactory to IDA through a selection&#13;
based on the consultants' qualifications, experience and competence relevant to the assignment. The&#13;
PMO will maintain a roster of intermediaries, NGOs specialized in community development. The&#13;
roster will be updated annually before the launching of the next project phase. Intermediaries,&#13;
mainly NGOs, will sign a convention with the PMO. Standard unit prices based on experience&#13;
during the pilot-phase for similar contracts will be used for the purpose of determining the amount&#13;
of the packages of activities delegated to intermediaries. The convention will stipulate that: (i)&#13;
intermediares would receive an advance of 30% of the estimated amrount corresponding to the&#13;
package of activities, upon submission of claim and a bank guarantee for equivalent amount -- valid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
until the delivery of services reaches the corresponding amount; and (ii) eligible expenditures would&#13;
be reimbursed against the provision of documentation justifying the expenses. Services for small&#13;
studies and seminars which can be delivered by Individual Consultants will be selected through&#13;
comparisons of qualifications among those expressing interest in the assignment or through direct&#13;
approach on the basis of work programs and terms of reference -- whenever possible in a&#13;
competitive way from a short-list of candidates drawn from the roster of individual consultants.&#13;
4.18   Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 may be comprised entirely of national&#13;
consultants if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive costs.&#13;
However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those contracts, they will not be excluded from&#13;
consideration. The standard Letter of Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Bank will&#13;
be used for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term&#13;
assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by firms or individual consultants. The&#13;
Government has been briefed and received additional clarification during negotiations about the&#13;
features of the new Consultants Guidelines, in particular with regards to advertisement and public&#13;
bid opening.&#13;
4.19   Prior Bank Review will be required for all works, goods, and service contracts valued at&#13;
more than US$ 100,000 equivalent and for consultant services contracts valued at more than&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Post review procedures will apply to&#13;
contracts for goods, works, and service contracts costing less than US$100,000 and to contracts for&#13;
consultant services estimated to cost less than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals.&#13;
However, this exception to prior review will not apply to the terms of references of such contracts,&#13;
to single-source hiring of firms, to assignment of a critical nature as determined by IDA, and to&#13;
amendment of contracts raising the contract value to US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000&#13;
or more for individuals. For consultant contracts estimated above US$200,000, opening the financial&#13;
envelopes will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's non-objection to the technical evaluation.&#13;
For contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000 and more than US$ 100,000 the borrower will&#13;
notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals.&#13;
Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the&#13;
borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions. The review process will&#13;
cover about 60 percent of the total value of the amount contracted for goods and 40 percent of the&#13;
amount contracted for civil works. Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold&#13;
levels will apply to about one in three contracts.&#13;
4.20   Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. Procurement will be&#13;
managed by the PMO, which could (i) recruit individual consultants and ad hoc short-term consultant&#13;
services for procurement assistance, as required; and (ii) obtain procurement training during the first two&#13;
years. During annual reviews, an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding procedures and&#13;
performance will be carried out as they relate to the program's procurement experience and, if&#13;
necessary, proposals of modifications to the current procedures that would accelerate procurement,&#13;
while still maintaining adequate control over contract awards and payments, would be made.&#13;
4.21   During negotiations agreement was reached on afinal Manualfor Procedures, acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para. 7. la), including the proper monitoring ofprocurement and standard bidding documents to&#13;
be used under NCB procedures for civil works and goods (para. 7.1 d). The Government gave assurance&#13;
at negotiations that it will: (a) use the Manual of Procedures; (b) use the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for ICB and the Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (c) apply the procurement procedures and&#13;
arrangements outlined in the above documents; and (d) review the procurement plan and arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
during the annual review with IDA. During implementation all bidding documents, bid evaluation&#13;
reports, and draft contracts transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the&#13;
procurement plan. Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a) prompt recording of contract award information by the Borrower; and&#13;
(b) semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Borrower indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for&#13;
individual contracts and the total program, including best estimates of allowances for&#13;
contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated procurement actions, including experience&#13;
with completion time and completion costs for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance&#13;
with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
The Government will give assurance at negotiations that it will take the necessary measures to ensure&#13;
that procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:&#13;
Procurement Phases               Maximum number of weeks&#13;
* Preparation of bidding documents   4 (12 for large contracts)&#13;
* Preparation of bids by bidders  4 (12 for ICB)&#13;
* Bid evaluation                 2 (4 for large contracts)&#13;
* Signature of contracts         2&#13;
* Payments                       4&#13;
c. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.22   The IDA Credit will be disbursed on the basis of expenditures, according to the categories&#13;
shown in Table 4. Disbursements from the IDA credit would be fully documented. However, the&#13;
borrower would be permitted to submit withdrawal applications on the basis of Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for goods and works,&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for consultant firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants.&#13;
To expedite disbursement and ensure that funds for the project are available when needed,&#13;
Government would open and maintain, in a commercial bank and ifor the duration of the project,&#13;
under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, a special account for IDA funds and a project&#13;
account for its own contribution. Both accounts will be managed by the Project Management Office.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government agreed to deposit its contribution for the first six months of&#13;
project implementation into the Project Account (para. 7. Ib). The establishment of the Special&#13;
Account and the deposit of the Government 's first-semester contribution in the Project Account is a&#13;
condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.2c). The special account would have an authorized amount&#13;
of US$1,000,000, equivalent approximately to six months estimated project expenditures.&#13;
Immediately upon credit effectiveness, IDA would make an initial deposit of US$500,000. Later, if&#13;
project execution and disbursements so justify and cumulative disbursements reach US$2,000,000,&#13;
the special account would be topped to its authorized amount of US$1,000,000. IDA would&#13;
replenish the account upon receipt of appropriate documentation satisfactory to IDA for incurred&#13;
eligible expenditures. Each replenishment request will be accompanied, as necessary, by the&#13;
required supporting documentation, an up-to-date Bank statement and a Reconciliation Statement.&#13;
Applications for direct payments can be submitted for amounts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
The IDA credit would be disbursed over a five-year period after credit effectiveness, and the closing&#13;
date would be January 31, 2004. The Disbursement Profile is shown in Annex XII.&#13;

D. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.23   The AIB, through the PMO, will ensure that the accounting and financial management&#13;
system, acceptable to IDA, will include internal control, accounting, budgeting and financial system&#13;
to safeguard project assets, ensure proper record keeping of all financial transactions in a format&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and provide accurate and timely managerial, financial and accounting&#13;
information regarding project activities. This system would include: (i) a Project Chart of&#13;
Accounts; (ii) mechanisms to classify expenditures by project components or activities, and&#13;
disbursements by categories and sources of funds, (iii) a record of monitorable physical and other&#13;
performance indicators for comparison with related costs; and (iv) procurement contract&#13;
management information. The putting in place of a financial and accounting system, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, will be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.2d)&#13;
4.24   The PMO will be responsible for the preparation of the project financial statements every&#13;
six months, including the Special Account (SA) statements and Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
These statements will be audited every six months in accordance with International Auditing&#13;
Standards by an independent, experienced and competent firm of auditors acceptable to IDA, on the&#13;
basis of terms of reference approved by IDA. The employment of independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA for the audit of project records, accounts andfinancial statements will be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 7.2d). The auditors will be appointed for a period of three years, renewable on a&#13;
yearly basis. Auditors will express separate opinions on project accounts, statements of&#13;
expenditures and special accounts. Audit reports and accompanying financial statements, including&#13;
SA statements and SOEs will be submitted to IDA for review no later than six months following the&#13;
close of each calendar year. Separate opinions on the SA and the SOEs will be in included in the&#13;
said report. During negotiations, assurances were given that the PMO will submit management and&#13;
financial audits every six months and technical audits every year (para. 7.1 e). The PMO will submit&#13;
to the Advisory Board and to IDA quarterly progress reports, covering: (i) a comparison of actual&#13;
physical and financial progress versus forecasts; (ii) updated six-month project forecasts; and (iii)&#13;
procurement status. It will also prepare an implementation completion report (ICR) within six&#13;
rnonths of the closing date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
E. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
4.25   The project will be supervised every four months. The necessary staff inputs for&#13;
supervision will be as follows: 40 staffweeks in FY99, 25 in FY2000, 30 in FY2001, 20 in FY2002,&#13;
20 in FY2003, 10 in FY2004 for a total of 145 staffweeks. A detailed supervision plan is shown in&#13;
Annex XIII. Given the need for close monitoring of the operation, there will be an evaluation at the&#13;
end of the first year during which an assessment of the participatoly process, the selection of&#13;
activities and project service providers, cost-effectiveness, and the implementation structure will be&#13;
undertaken. This evaluation would permit any necessary modifications to the Manual of&#13;
Procedures, institutional arrangements, and participatory approach in close coordination with all&#13;
concerned stakeholders. Another assessment will be held at the end of the project for purposes of&#13;
project evaluation and assessment of the participatory approach for future Bank operations.&#13;
4.26   The Bank will supervise the Project through a joint headquarters/Resident Mission team&#13;
approach. A headquarters-based Task Manager will have overall responsibility in meeting Bank&#13;
requirements and in leading supervision missions consisting of sec.tor and procurement specialists.&#13;
A staff member of the Resident Mission will be the Task Manager's back-up and ensure tracking&#13;
and monitoring of the project, and make periodic visits to the regions, project sites, and participating&#13;
communities.&#13;
4.27   During the first two years of project implementation an Annual Review will be conducted&#13;
by the Board in conjunction with a supervision mission (conceivably a mid-term review and second&#13;
annual review would be combined). Annual reviews will assess progress in community&#13;
development, identify key constraints and propose actions or research to address them, as well as&#13;
consider the annual program and budget.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.28   This project has been classified as category C in view of the size of the sub-projects to be&#13;
financed. The sub-projects, such as community infrastructure or the provision of potable water,&#13;
linked with a constant program of information, education, and communication, should have a very&#13;
limited, if any, negative impact on the environment. A major concern is to ensure that efforts to&#13;
improve hunger and poverty do not result in damage to the environment or in environmental health&#13;
hazards that exacerbate this vulnerability. To minimize this, the training program will include&#13;
training on the environmental management of sub-projects.&#13;
G. PROJECT OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES&#13;
4.29   The proposed project is a poverty-targeted intervention responding to the Government's&#13;
objectives of human resource development and poverty reduction. It meets this objective by&#13;
fostering improved collaboration among the concerned stakeholders, the community, NGOs, and&#13;
Government at every stage of the project process. By adopting this innovative participatory&#13;
approach to responding to community-requested priorities in the fight hunger and poverty in&#13;
disadvantaged areas of Mali, the project hopes to embrace the sustainability and ownership aspects&#13;
right from the start. By promoting this collaboration through a "working together approach", project&#13;
sustainability is further ensured by building local capacity of beneficiaries and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
H. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.30   The participatory approach embraced by the project is geared to ensuring sustainability.&#13;
From the outset, targeted communities will be involved in project design, implementation and&#13;
supervision. Community contributions and the set-up of village management committees further&#13;
reinforce community commitment and ownership. Given its experimental and capacity building&#13;
nature, the project will ensure that key stakeholders remain committed to the process, that feedback&#13;
on progress is communicated, that necessary adaptations are made to adjust to operational realities,&#13;
and that relevant training is provided to the community and key partners. In this regard, the Manual&#13;
of Procedures is seen as a living document, to be modified over time. Program implementation and&#13;
outcomes will be regularly supervised, monitored and evaluated by the Government and NGOs.&#13;
5. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.1    The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system will monitor the implementation process of&#13;
the project, the output produced and the progress on achieving its three main objectives, namely in&#13;
improving living conditions of targeted rural communities, strengthening local capacity (mobilizaton&#13;
and planning capacities of communities and NGO/Government partnership) and strengthening&#13;
policy decision-making and institutional capacity at the local and national level. Using a&#13;
participatory approach, the M&amp;E system is designed as a perennial assessment and adjustment&#13;
process, based on common information management tools made available to all stakeholders&#13;
(communities and their private and public partners) at the local, regional and central levels of&#13;
decision-making. This new approach to M&amp;E aims at enhancing Project overall performance,&#13;
increasing conditions for sustainability of activities, and improving effectiveness of project&#13;
resources and management of risks and difficulties.&#13;
5.2    A reference framework of basic indicators related to poverty reduction, capacity building&#13;
and efficient project implementation has been identified in consultation with key stakeholders at the&#13;
central and regional levels (Table 5). The participatory nature of the M&amp;E system provides&#13;
communities the opportunity to identify indicators relevant to their activity from this framework.&#13;
Tools to gather, synthesize and store the information into a data base have been designed for the&#13;
different levels of project management (local/community, regional/intermediaries, national/PMO).&#13;
Analysis and feedback mechanisms have also been identified and integrated into the detailed&#13;
planning process of the Project activities.&#13;
5.3    Six implementation (input/output) indicators are used to monitor the project output in&#13;
physical and human terms, and the efficiency of the implementation process. The monitoring of&#13;
these indicators will help improve the cost-effectiveness of Project inputs, as well as the replicability&#13;
of the approach adopted. These indicators are designed to: (a) keep track of proposals received,&#13;
reviewed and approved; (b) track implementation and disbursement progress throughout the&#13;
implementation cycle; (c) analyze sector content and evolution of the portfolio; (d) analyze the&#13;
extent and type of participation of community groups, NGOs, and others; (e) compile a summary of&#13;
physical achievements; (f) analyze delays, conflicts, difficulties encountered in the implementation&#13;
process; (g) monitor the amount of technical assistance provided by the Project; and (h) calculate&#13;
unit costs of project activities and compare them to the benefits encountered and perceived.&#13;

coordinated by the specialist in M&amp;E of the PMO, who is responsible for synthesizing all&#13;
information gathered through the system on a quarterly and annual basis, supervising the&#13;
implementation of the M&amp;E system at all levels, providing feedback (seminars, reports, reference&#13;
documentation) to stakeholders on results and lessons leaned, and training them in managing their&#13;
own M&amp;E information system in relation to the Project's M&amp;E system. The M&amp;E system will&#13;
assist the PMO in: (a) identifying priority IEC and training activities; (ii) identifying and carrying&#13;
out operational studies and analysis to improve results; and (iii) assessing Project outcomes against&#13;
Performance Indicators. A mid-term review will be carried out to assess lessons learned and&#13;
identify necessary adjustments to project approach, mechanisms anid modalities.&#13;
5.6    The M&amp;E system is linked to operational research to: (i) hlelp identify data aggregation&#13;
mechanisms between qualitative feedback from project beneficiaries and quantitative information;&#13;
(ii) harmnonize scientific and pragmatic data; and (iii) carry out timely studies in a number of&#13;
communities to analyze the evolution of selected indicators, the effectiveness of project strategies&#13;
compared to other approaches implemented in Mali, or any other questions raised throughout project&#13;
supervision. (Annex XIV provides details of the M&amp;E information system and a list of key&#13;
indicators.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
6.  BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1    For sub-projects, economic analysis can be done, but since the community-requested&#13;
interventions will be chosen during the course of the project life, economic analysis will be based on&#13;
(i) minimum criteria, including a rate of return of 10% using a simplified methodology and (ii)&#13;
subsequent evaluations of a random sample of 10% of sub-projects in a particular category. A&#13;
descriptive methodology is presented in Annex XV for two typical sub-projects expected to be&#13;
requested by communities, namely wells and the construction of classrooms. The economic&#13;
justification of other activities, such as the IEC program, cannot be expressed in quantitative terms.&#13;
However, evidence has shown the importance of building capacity of local institutions and of&#13;
promoting participatory approaches in decision-making to ensure stronger ownership and eventual&#13;
sustainability of investments. Justification for the Observatory lies in the fact that despite the amount&#13;
of resources spent on social sectors and conducting different surveys, there is neither capacity at the&#13;
national level to monitor the poverty focus of these investments nor to analyze the large amount of&#13;
information resulting from surveys.&#13;
6.2    There will be very little fiscal impact, except for the Observatory that will require roughly&#13;
$60,000 a year in recurrent costs. It is expected that the fiscal impact of better-focused public&#13;
expenditures to poor populations, though not quantifiable, can only be positive.&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.3    The project would help reduce poverty in the most vulnerable rural communities in Mopti,&#13;
and other regions. This would be achieved in the short term by financing sub-projects identified by&#13;
the communities themselves as having highest priority in improving their living conditions. Direct&#13;
beneficiaries of the sub-projects and capacity building activities are estimated at roughly 130,000&#13;
persons. The training program will strengthen the managerial, monitoring and evaluation skills of&#13;
about 25 intermediaries; the communication skills and knowldege in participatory methods and&#13;
gender analysis of around 90 NGOs in community development and 520 village animation agents;&#13;
the organizational capacity of 130 village management committees; and improve collaboration of&#13;
local technical services and regional/local development committees. In addition, the project will&#13;
indirectly touch neighboring villages of the targeted villages (during the pilot phase the benefits&#13;
from a pilot sub-project reached an average of three neighboring villages). The Observatory and the&#13;
DNSI will also benefit from the institutional support component through improved capacity in data&#13;
analysis and a stronger poverty monitoring system.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
6.4    The first risk is the challenge in building and nurturing a new relationship between&#13;
communities, local authorities and the central Government. The GRIP is the first project which&#13;
explicitly supports a participatory process with targeted communities right from the beginning --&#13;
eliciting their participation in the identification of priorities, involving them in the implementation&#13;
and maintenance of investments responding to those priorities -- and which implicates local&#13;
authorities and technical services in the process. This support at the grassroots level is being&#13;
provided in advance of a national decentralization effort, now being planned and expected to be&#13;
implemented during 1998. Fostering the level of trust required for this new relationship is part of an&#13;
extended process, supported by the project, which will begin slowly, accelerating with experience&#13;
and demonstrated results. The second risk is the extent to which the Government and NGOs can&#13;
manage to maintain an ongoing dialogue, and their willingness to collaborate and compromise in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
order to implement programs at the community level. This is a new and experimental partnership&#13;
for both, one which will be tested throughout the project life. The creation of an Association with&#13;
beneficiary representatives on its Advisory Board and the successful experience of the pilot phase in&#13;
testing this partnership on the ground, all augur well for the commitment of the two partners to&#13;
continue this cooperative process. The third risk is linked to institutional weaknesses, namely that&#13;
project implementation may be hampered by limitations on technical competence, absorptive&#13;
capacity, and familiarity with Bank procedures by service providers. This concern has been&#13;
addressed through clear selection criteria, inclusion of training to the community, training in&#13;
community development to the NGO-CD and training to intermediaries on Bank procedures, and a&#13;
system to monitor and evaluate performance outcomes. Finally, project achievements may be&#13;
constrained by difficulty in reaching communities, transferring knowledge and improved practices,&#13;
and sustaining community involvement in maintenance of sub-projects. This risk is mitigated by&#13;
ensuring the presence of an NGO-CD and the CDA in the community throughout the sub-project&#13;
cycle, assisting communities in defining relevant IEC themes, providing appropriate training to&#13;
respond to these community-identified themes, and requiring community contribution to the sub-&#13;
project.&#13;

NGO Capacity Assessment Summary&#13;
The NGO Capacity Assessment, conducted during September/October 1995, surveyed 60&#13;
international and national NGOs, including the four thematic Pivot Groups (natural resources&#13;
management, primary education, health and child care, and small enterprises) and the coordinating&#13;
NGO bodies (CCA-ONG and SECO-ONG). The study focused principally on NGOs meeting the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
(i) administrative aspects: legal statute in order with the Administration and respect of&#13;
regular reporting requirements;&#13;
(ii) active participation in NGO coordinating groups: payment of membership dues,&#13;
availability of information;&#13;
(iii) NGO operations: minimum 5 year experience, responsible for a variety of&#13;
projects/programs;&#13;
(iv) areas of intervention with high prevalence of hunger and poverty: Mopti, Kayes,&#13;
Gao.&#13;
Principal Results&#13;
The study notes that since 1969 there has been a positive development towards greater&#13;
technical professionalism and management of both national and international NGOs. This trend,&#13;
fully supported by donors, is leading to increased accountability of the staff of NGOs and favors a&#13;
participatory management style.&#13;
As to national NGOs surveyed, the main findings of the study were:&#13;
*  Areas of intervention: Since most NGOs intervene in the same sector, namely natural&#13;
resources management, community development, health/child care,&#13;
education/training/literacy, support to productive activities (cereal banks, vegetable&#13;
gardens), water supply, and micro-enterprise support (credit, processing), it is often&#13;
difficult to know their area of specialty. This is often the case because NGOs go where&#13;
the funds are. Specialization is, however, beginning to take hold, as seen by the positive&#13;
coordination impact of sectoral Pivot Groups. Geographically, NGOs intervene&#13;
throughout Mali, though there is a large concentration in the drought-stricken regions of&#13;
Tomboctou, Gao and Mopti;&#13;
*  Projectplanning: NGOs use a planning-by-objective approach to design and prepare&#13;
projects, and have competent staff for project implementation. Participatory methods&#13;
are widely used, especially the MARP (Methode Active de Recherche et Planification&#13;
Participative -- Participatory Rural Appraisal). Principal constraints are logistic&#13;
problems and delays in availability of funds;&#13;
*  Relationship with partners: contractual partnership with community organizations;&#13;
information-sharing with other NGOs (collectives, coordinating bodies, thematic pivot&#13;
groups);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
Annex II&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
*  Institutional aspects: All NGOs have legal statute and documented internal procedures.&#13;
Regular payment of membership dues is problematic for about half of the NGOs. In&#13;
three-quarters of the cases, the general accountant is also a member of the NGO Board,&#13;
possibly leading to problems of rigor and transparency. NGOs generally respect&#13;
internal procedures, and one-third have manuals of procedures for administrative,&#13;
accounting and financial management, while another third are in the process of&#13;
preparing them;&#13;
*  Personnel: personnel manuals are very rare; on average there are 2-3 permanent high-&#13;
level staff; rarely have expatriates; staff mainly consists of unemployed graduates,&#13;
pensioners, or laid-off employees, who often have good technical skills, but lack&#13;
management experience;&#13;
*  Financial and accounting management: three-quariters of NGOs rely on project-&#13;
specific funding; major confusion in functions, namely in the roles and responsibilities&#13;
between supervisor and implementor and between manager and accountant; all NGOs&#13;
have bank accounts with the system of "double signal:ures"; financial analysis is rarely&#13;
done; on average operating costs represent 10-15% of total budget, but probably higher&#13;
due to fuzziness between investment and operating costs;&#13;
*  supervision and audit: technical and financial reports are provided 2-3 times annually;&#13;
internal supervision done monthly or quarterly; external supervision done by donors;&#13;
only financial audits are done (external audits done for large amounts of financing on&#13;
the insistence of donors).&#13;

Lessons from Projects using Participatory Approaches&#13;
The Grassroots Initiatives Project to Fight Hunger and Poverty has incorporated lessons&#13;
from a number of programs/projects in Mali and elsewhere that have relied on a participatory&#13;
approach to meet development community needs. In Mali these programs/projects include: (i) the&#13;
Natural Resources Management Project (NRMP); (ii) the Programme de Consolidation des&#13;
Associations Paysannes (PCAP); (iii) Fonds d'Investissement Local (FIL) of the French&#13;
Cooperation; (iv) Micro-projects Program of the European Union; (v) the Fund for Family&#13;
Education of the Health, Population and Rural Water Supply Project (FASEF), supported by the&#13;
World Bank; (vi) completed Rural Water Supply Project (RWSP) financed by the World Bank; (vii)&#13;
Public Works and Capacity Building Project (AGETIPE), financed by the World Bank. Experience&#13;
from other Bank operations outside Mali also taken into account in project design include: the&#13;
Program for Alleviation of Poverty and Social Costs of Adjustment Project (PAPSCA) in Uganda,&#13;
Private Sector Competitiveness Project in Uganda, the Grassroots Initiatives Project in Togo, the&#13;
Village Infrastructure Project (VIP) for Java in Indonesia and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program&#13;
in Pakistan.&#13;
The principal lessons learned from the above operations regarding community participation&#13;
are:&#13;
*  needfor community participation: community participation throughout a project cycle&#13;
fosters a greater sense of ownerhsip and increases the chances for sustainable&#13;
interventions. It often enhances project design and improves trust among different&#13;
stakeholders (NRMP, PCAP, FIL, PAPSCA);&#13;
*  sensitization program: promotion and dissemination of informnation on the project is&#13;
necessary before project implementation (village contract). This program should be&#13;
very clear on project objectives, responsibilities of each partner, project outputs, and&#13;
follow-up required (NRMP, PCAP, RWSP);&#13;
*  community contribution: mechanisms for community participation and beneficiary&#13;
contribution in project need to be designed in consultation with communities (10-25%&#13;
contribution appears feasible) (NRMP, FIL, PAPSCA);&#13;
*  identiflcation of community priorities: effective implementation requires involvement&#13;
of relevant stakeholders in project design, which entails considerable groundwork,&#13;
preparation and consensus building. During this process it is also important to ensure&#13;
that viewpoints of different groups are taken into account and not only those of an&#13;
individual or individual group (NRMP, PCAP, FED, PAPSCA);&#13;
*  institutional arrangements: village management committees (members elected or&#13;
accepted by the beneficiaries) serve as good spokepersons for the community during&#13;
project implementation and as the pivot group for project maintenance in the future&#13;
(NRMP, PCAP, FIL, Aga Khan);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
Annex m&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
*  manual ofprocedures: such a manual, which establishes clear and flexible framework&#13;
for project implementation, is a valuable instrument to ensure transparency.&#13;
Procurement procedures should be kept simple and avoid heavy bureaucracy&#13;
(AGETIPE, NRMP, PCAP, PAPSCA);&#13;
*  fle-xibility: participatory approach should be flexible, namely be based on innovation,&#13;
testing and adjustment as experience is gained (NRMP, Aga Khan);&#13;
* role of NGOs: NGOs can be effective facilitators in community-based development.&#13;
However, they must be pre-qualified and selected on a competitive basis (selection&#13;
criteria and procedures to be clearly defined in the mranual of procedures) (Health&#13;
Services Development Project, AGETIPE, PAPSCA, Grassroots Initiatives Project in&#13;
Togo);&#13;
-  supervision of works: independent supervision of infrastructure works is essential&#13;
(Grassroots Initiatives Project in Togo);&#13;
*  monitoring system: project with significant community participation should have in-&#13;
built monitoring system to assess the views of community on the efficiency of&#13;
implementation and to allow timely modifications to project design (NRMP, PAPSCA,&#13;
Aga Khan);&#13;
*  sub-project maintenance: responsibility for maintenance clearly rests with&#13;
beneficiaries; agreement on this should be obtained with the community before sub-&#13;
project selection, and should be officialized in a contract between the community and&#13;
project implementing agency. Training of beneficiaries in maintenance activities should&#13;
be included in project to assure sustainability of sub-project infrastructure (RWSP,&#13;
PCAP, FED, VIP);&#13;
* future sub-projectfinancing: villagers generally accept the principle that the financing&#13;
of other sub-projects within their community depends on the commitment they have&#13;
shown with the first sub-project (PCAP, FIL);&#13;
*  avoiding duplication: village proposals need to be submitted at sub-regional level for&#13;
harmonization with regional development programs (NRMP, PCAP, VIP).&#13;

Methodologie D'une Approche Participative&#13;
Introduction&#13;
L'utilisation d'une approche participative dans le PAIB s'impose a la fois comme exigence&#13;
et condition de reussite. C'est une exigence en ce sens qu'un objectif cle du projet est de "renforcer&#13;
la capacite des communautes A participer dans l'identification de leurs besoins prioritaires, la&#13;
conception, 1'execution et le suivi-evaluation des actions qui repondent a ces besoins, en partenariat&#13;
avec les ONG et les autorites locales". C'est une condition de reussite, d'abord parce que 1'evidence&#13;
montre qu'aucune action de developpement ne peut reussir, combler les espoirs escomptes sans la&#13;
participation volontaire et responsable des int6resses, tant il est vrai qu'on ne d6veloppe pas un&#13;
absent. Plus un programme/projet de developpement fait appel aux acteurs concernes et leur profite,&#13;
plus le milieu social pourra assurer le maintien des realisations. C'est enfin, une condition de&#13;
reussite en ce sens que le PAIB met en relation divers acteurs qui doivent se consulter, se concerter&#13;
pour d6cider et choisir ensemble . C'est donc un veritable partenariat qu'il faut instaurer entre les&#13;
differents acteurs qui sont: les populations, les autorites locales (organisations villageoises, inter-&#13;
villageoises, comit6s locaux de developpement), les autorites regionales (CRD), les services&#13;
techniques gouvernementaux et les ONG.&#13;
Cet annexe presente la methodologie que nous proposons pour demarrer le PAIB. Cette&#13;
methodologie concerne surtout la participation des populations aux differentes etapes des actions qui&#13;
seront entreprises a leur intention.&#13;
Definition&#13;
Le PAIB adopte la definition que I'OCDE (Organisation de Cooperation et Developpement&#13;
Economiques) donne au developpement participatif: " un processius par lequel la population, les&#13;
collectivites et les pays parviennent a faire entendre leurs voix et accroissent leur autonomie,&#13;
passant d'un 6tat de passivit6 ou de soumission a une action fond6e sur la n6gociation. Le&#13;
developpement participatif fait partie integrante du processus de developpement durable".&#13;
Principes Directeurs&#13;
La participation est une maniere de vivre qui s'exprime a travers un ensemble de&#13;
comportements et d'attitudes. Pour reussir le processus participatif, il faut necessairement adopter&#13;
de nouveaux comportements et attitudes dont les plus importants dans le cadre du PAIB sont les&#13;
suivants:&#13;
respect des populations et de leur culture: Les populations, collectivit6s et&#13;
organisations locales doivent etre consid6rees comme des acteurs et partenaires 6gaux A&#13;
part entiere. Ce qui revient a dire qu'il faudra faire confiance et respecter leurs savoirs,&#13;
savoir-faire et savoir-etre; leurs valeurs et perceptions; et chercher A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
Annex V&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
comprendre ces valeurs. Pour les intervenants exterieurs, il s'agira surtout de chercher A&#13;
comprendre les priorites locales et non les leurs; d'amener les populations A avoir&#13;
confiance en elles-memes en leur expliquant qu'elles ont un r6le primordial A jouer dans&#13;
la resolution de leurs propres problemes et qu'elles en sont capables. Cet attitude est&#13;
surtout important si le projet cherche un changement de comportements suite aux&#13;
activites d'information/educationlcommunication (IEC);&#13;
* stimulation et renforcement de la dynamique interne des collectivites: Le&#13;
processus de d6veloppement s'agit surtout d'accompagner les populations locales dans&#13;
leur recherche de moyens leur permettant de resoudre leurs problemes;&#13;
* promotion de I'appropriation des actions et durabilite: Pour achever l'appropriation&#13;
et la durabilite, les activites devraient repondre parfaitement aux besoins des&#13;
populations; etre adaptees a leurs competences et contraintes financieres; et etre&#13;
progressivement maitris6es et appropriees par celles-ci. De facon plus precise,&#13;
appropriation et durabilite s'obtiennent A travers un renforcement des capacites&#13;
institutionnelles, techniques et financieres de la communaute;&#13;
* promotion de la participation des femmes et autres groupes defavorises: pendant&#13;
l'enquete participative et durant tout le processus d'une action du PAIB dans une&#13;
communaute, une attention particuliere sera portee aux interets des femmes et autres&#13;
groupes d6favorises en vue d'assurer leur pleine participation aux activites identifiees.&#13;
Demarche Operationnelle&#13;
Cette section decrit comment il faut concretement s'y prendre sur le terrain avec les&#13;
populations et collectivites ciblees.&#13;
Manifestation de la volonte villageoise a adherer au PAIB&#13;
Avant l'intervention directe du PAIB dans une commnunaute, une campagne de&#13;
sensibilisation et d'information sera organisee aupres des populations et autorites locales des&#13;
villages eligibles. Lors des cette campagne, on expliquera la philosophie, l'orientation et la&#13;
methodologie du projet au cour d'assemblees generales et de reunions de groupes restreints. A la fin&#13;
de ces discussions, une Demande d'Appui (voir Manuel de Procedures) sera remise au village qui la&#13;
remplira et l'enverra au PAIB pour lui manifester son desir d'adhesion. En plus des reunions&#13;
villageoises, des emissions aux radios privees locales seront utilisdes lors de la campagne&#13;
d'information sur le projet.&#13;
Recrutement de l'ONG executante&#13;
Le PAIB recrute une ONG en developpement communautaire pour les villages ayant&#13;
exprime leur adhesion au projet. Cette ONG, qui constituera la presence du PAIB dans le village,&#13;
recrutera un agent en developpement communautaire qui assurera la continuite d' information sur le&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

projet et facilitera/coordonnera les activites du PAIB dans le villages. Une des taches clees de cet&#13;
agent est de former des animateurs(trices) villageois(es) pour assurer la releve.&#13;
Enquetes participatives et etudes de faisabilite dans la communaute ciblie&#13;
L'enquete participative, une etape clee dans le processus de developpement communautaire,&#13;
vise essentiellement A identifier a la fois les besoins et actions prioritaires de developpement du&#13;
village ainsi que les capacites, attitudes et pratiques des populations.&#13;
Premiere itape: Une premiere assemblee generale, regroupant toutes les couches sociales&#13;
(hommes/femmes, jeunes/vieux, riches/pauvres, nobles/castes, categories sociales), sera organis6e&#13;
pour une reconfirmation publique de l'intention du village. On y presente les buts et objectifs de la&#13;
mission ainsi que la methodologie de travail et le calendrier. La philosophie, I'orientation et la&#13;
methodologie du projet sont reexposees lors de cette premiere assemblee sans engager de&#13;
discussions.&#13;
Ensuite, on procede aux discussions de groupes sur la phiilosophie, l'orientation et la&#13;
methodologie du projet. Au cours de ces discussions, on s'attachera A determiner la comprehension&#13;
qu'a chaque groupe de la faim et de la pauvrete; les explications qu'il donne des causes,&#13;
manifestations et consequences de la faim et pauvrete, la proportion de la population qu'il estime&#13;
Otre touchee et le groupe social qui lui semble le plus affect6. Le nombre des groupes de discussion&#13;
sera fonction du nombre de categories sociales pertinentes dans Il localite et leur constitution sera&#13;
faite selon le procede de l'echantillonnage intentionnel (c'est-A-dire, un nombre egal de repondants&#13;
pour chaque sexe et ayant le plus de chance de fournir les renseignements voulus). Cependant dans&#13;
chaque localite, en plus des groupes selon la catdgorie sociale, on tachera de constituer&#13;
specifiquement un groupe d'informateurs qualifies (de nombre egal pour chaque sexe) pour recenser&#13;
les evenements importants de famine et pauvrete ayant marque l'histoire du village, les groupes les&#13;
plus affectes, les strategies appliquees et leur efficacite.&#13;
Apres les discussions de groupes, 1'equipe procede A la synthese de toutes les informations&#13;
collectees et les presente A une deuxieme assemblee generale pouIr validation. A l'issue de&#13;
l'assemblee generale de restitution, 1'equipe s'enquiert de la volonte de la communaute A confirmer&#13;
son adhesion a la philosophie, orientation et methodologie du projet. Si la communaute declare son&#13;
adhesion au projet, 1'equipe lui expose alors les objectifs, methologie et calendrier de la deuxieme&#13;
etape de l'enquete.&#13;
Deuxieme etape: Cette etape consiste a collecter et analyser avec les populations les&#13;
donnees relatives a leurs conditions de vie en vue d'identifier les problemes, hierarchiser les besoins&#13;
de developpement, choisir les solutions, planifier les activites et elaborer une charte des&#13;
responsabilites (confere en annexe la fiche standard des informaticins de base a collecter).&#13;
Lors des enquetes participatives, 1'equipe veillera a organiser des sessions avec un&#13;
echantillonnage representatif de toutes les categories sociales, a la fois individuellement et&#13;
collectivement, en vue de leur permettre d'exprimer leurs preoccupations. Cette deuxieme etape&#13;
s'acheve par une assemblee generale de synthese qui adopte les decisions quant aux besoins et&#13;
actions prioritaires ainsi qu'aux capacites, attitudes et pratiques. Au cours de cette pleniere,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1'equipe de chercheurs informe la communaute de l'importance pour elle de participer a l'execution&#13;
et a la gestion des sous-projets et aussi de la necessite de constituer un comite de gestion du village,&#13;
responsable pour la gestion de I'action retenue. Elle indique les criteres de choix des membres du&#13;
comite de gestion, rappelle les objectifs et calendrier de la mission et annonce le demarrage de&#13;
1'etude de faisabilite.&#13;
Les enqu8tes participatives seront menees par une equipe pluridisciplinaire de cinq (5)&#13;
chercheurs dont deux femmes et provenant (si possible) du monde ONG. L'equipe devra inclure les&#13;
competences suivantes: en approche participative; en analyse du genre; en analyse sociologique; en&#13;
analyse economique; en techniques des ressources naturelles; en demographie ou g6ographie.&#13;
L'equipe des chercheurs pourrait &amp;re assistee par deux (2) enqu&amp;eurs tous locuteurs de la langue du&#13;
milieu et maitrisant les methodes de recherche participative.&#13;
Troisieme etape: L'action retenue par la communaute sera verifier aupres des autorit6s&#13;
locales (commune/arrondissement, cercle et region), afin d'assurer la conformite et la coherence du&#13;
sous-projet avec les programmes de developpement local existants (carte scolaire, carte sanitaire,&#13;
etc).&#13;
Quatrieme etape: L'etude de faisabilite demarre immediatement apres verification de la&#13;
conformite des actions prioritaires choisies avec les programmes de developpement local. Elles est&#13;
executee, en collaboration avec les villageois, par la m8me equipe de chercheurs qui se ferait&#13;
adjoindre les personnes ressources necessaires (par exemple des techniciens des services publics&#13;
regionaux ou locaux). L'etude de faisabilite doit fournir des informations precises (comme la&#13;
faisabilite technique, la rentabilite economique, le cout global estimatif, le niveau estimatif de la&#13;
participation villageoise, le niveau d'organisation villageoise souhaite) permettant a la population de&#13;
faire des choix pertinents.&#13;
Le maximum de temps a utiliser pour les enqu8tes participatives et les etudes de faisabilite&#13;
dans les communautes est de quinze (15) jours dont: 10 jours pour les enqu8tes participatives (trois&#13;
jours pour la premiere etape; six jours pour la deuxieme etape et un jour pour la troisieme etape) et 5&#13;
jours pour les etudes de faisabilite.&#13;
Mise en place d'un comite de gestion du village&#13;
Ce comite de gestion du village, soit qu'il existe deja ou qu'il doit 8tre cre6e, constituera&#13;
l'interface entre le PAIB et la communaute. Il pourra 8tre un comite de coordination de plusieurs&#13;
groupes sociaux de la communaute. Dans tous les cas, il devra 8tre mandate par la communaute pour&#13;
gerer les activites realisees dans le cadre du sous-projet.&#13;
Mais sa mise en place exige une connaissance plus approfondie du contexte social de la&#13;
communaute. L'agent en developpement communautaire, qui est responsable de la mise en place du&#13;
comite de gestion du village, discutera avec les populations pour identifier des personnes fiables&#13;
(hommes et femmes) devant &amp;re membres de cette structure et evitera qu'elle ne soit rdcup6ree par&#13;
les privilegies du milieu. Les premieres seances de discussion au sujet du comite de gestion du&#13;
village auront lieu au moment des enqu8tes participatives . Les discussions se poursuivront apres&#13;
l'enquete participative par l'agent en developpement communautaire et aussi en equipe lors des&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Annex V&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
etudes de faisabilite . Aprbs la mise en place du comite de gestion, I'agent en developpement&#13;
communautaire aidera a identifier de maniere participative les besoins de formation du comite&#13;
(alphabetisation fonctionnelle, gestion comptable, tenue des documents et registres, organisation de&#13;
reunions, circulation de l'information, capacites de negociation,etc.).&#13;
Planification/programmation des activites du sous-projet&#13;
L'enqu8te participative doit aboutir A l'identification des besoins, au choix d'une action&#13;
prioritaire et a l'identification des themes pertinents aux populations vises A un changement de&#13;
comportement. Apres ce choix, intervient l'etude de faisabilite aua cours de laquelle les populations&#13;
et l'equipe procedent d'une part, A la planification de toutes les principales activites concernant&#13;
l'execution, la gestion et le suivi-evaluation du sous-projet et d'aujtre part, A l'identification des&#13;
responsables de chaque activites. Evidemment certains aspects de cette planification seront precises&#13;
ou revus quand d'autres intervenants entreront en action (comme les entrepreneurs).&#13;
Signature d'un contrat de partenariat entre la communaute et le projet&#13;
La signature d'un accord entre la communaute et le projeit intervient apres la selection du&#13;
sous-projet par le Bureau de Gestion du Projet(BGP). Cette signature doit s'effectuer lors d'une&#13;
seance publique A laquelle participent les representants de la communaute, des autorites locales , de&#13;
l'ONG en developpement communautaire, de l'intermediaire et du projet. Elle est publique et reunit&#13;
toutes ces personnalit6s parce qu'il faut lui donner un caractere officiel et solennel, choses&#13;
auxquelles les populations sont sensibles.&#13;
Execution des activites identifiees&#13;
Pendant toute l'execution des activites, la participation des communautes sera encouragee et&#13;
soutenue a travers les programmes de formation necessaire.&#13;
Suivi et 6valuation&#13;
Les populations seront impliquees dans l' identification des indicateurs de performance et&#13;
d'impact des activitds, A la collecte des informations relatives a ces indicateurs, a l'analyse des&#13;
resultats et A la prise des decisions subsequentes (voir Annexe XIV). Ces activites de collecte et&#13;
d'analyse de l'information avec les populations peuvent debuter lors des enqu8tes participatives&#13;
mais seront poursuivies et finalisees pendant la periode de l'etude de faisabilite. Elles pourraient se&#13;
r6aliser a travers les dtapes suivantes:&#13;
Etape 1: Invitation des habitants du village a une reunion sous l'arbre pour faire le point&#13;
sur l'activit6 identifide. Lors de cette reunion il faut prendre soin de bien identifier les&#13;
differents groupes auxquels appartiennent les participants: membres du conseil villageois,&#13;
femmes, jeunes, vieux, agriculteurs, eleveurs, animateurs d'alphabetisation, agent en&#13;
developpement communautaire, agents des services techniques au niveau local.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
Annex V&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
Etape 2: On engage alors la discussion sur les aspects de realisation du sous-projet: quel&#13;
groupe est responsable de quoi dans la mise en oeuvre, les couts, la duree et la date&#13;
d'execution des activites, la contribution du village, celle du PAIB, autres sources de&#13;
financement.&#13;
Etape 3: Identification des benefices a tirer du sous-projet, en ayant en tete le cadre de&#13;
reference de I'analyse d'impact: I'acces aux infrastructures apportees par le sous-projet,&#13;
reduction de temps apporte par l'infrastructure (cas d'un puits), type d'am6lioration des&#13;
conditions de vie, organisation du travail pour la construction et la gestion de&#13;
l'infrastructure, comite de gestion pour 1'entretien, alphab6tisation fonctionnelle pour la&#13;
tenue des documents (comptables et administratifs), constitution d'un fonds villageois&#13;
(capacite des villageois), montant de la redevance a payer par les usagers de l'infrastructure,&#13;
partenaires locaux dans la gestion (capacite institutionnelle).&#13;
Etape 4: Identification des resultats des activites et mesures disponibles au village:&#13;
nombre des retardataires dans le paiement des redevances, niveau de satisfaction des besoins&#13;
de la localite par l'infrastructure , nature et importance des problemes crees par le sous-&#13;
projet. Le suivi-evaluation doit maintenir les donnees pertinentes pour l'analyse et la&#13;
comparaison. DMs que ces donnees sont collectees, plusieurs analyses sont possibles:&#13;
pourquoi un si grand nombre de retardataires? Que faire pour resoudre les problemes&#13;
engendres par le sous-projet?&#13;
Etape 5: Examen des supports d'information au village: mallette renfermant le diagnostic&#13;
et le schema en francais et en langue locale, cahiers de suivi de la redevance, cahier des&#13;
visiteurs, documents de gestion comptable et administrative. Analyse de leur tenue, de leur&#13;
contenu, du mode d'organisation et de prdsentation de l'information, de l'utilite de la saisie&#13;
de ces donnees.&#13;

Community-level Social Mobilization and&#13;
Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
Programs&#13;
This section describes the social mobilization and IEC approaches which the NGO&#13;
specializing in community development (NGO-CD) and the community development agent (CDA)&#13;
will draw on to accompany the infrastructure development sub-projects.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Social Mobilization/IEC programs are to:&#13;
*  assist selected communities identify their priority needs and participate in meeting them;&#13;
*  foster positive behavioral practices linked to improved food availability, water&#13;
resources, health and educational facilities.&#13;
Issues&#13;
Four major issues will substantially affect the design and likely success of the Social&#13;
Mobilization/lEC programs:&#13;
Cultural Diversity and Dispersion of Sub-Projects&#13;
-  The diversity of linguistic/cultural groups requires that information be developed and&#13;
disseminated in multiple languages, with customized messages and visual images for&#13;
each ethnic group if different behaviors are to be promoted&#13;
*  Flexible, cost-effective strategies will be required for training and support of CDAs.&#13;
The project will emphasize the elaboration of self-contained communication modules&#13;
that are easily replicable from one village to another.&#13;
Regional Characteristics and Communications Infrastructure&#13;
* The type of agro-climatic zone will affect cropping patterns and the foods consumed.&#13;
For certain sub-projects and the behavior change activities that will be linked to them&#13;
(gardens, dietary diversification, food processing and preservation), it will be necessary&#13;
to work out "best practices" for the agricultural zone, as well as each technical area.&#13;
*  Communication infrastructure (written press, local radio stations, national radio,&#13;
television, and portable video equipment) in Mali is not strong. Yet, the situation is&#13;
evolving rapidly. Since 1991 the number of private radio stations and vernacular press&#13;
offerings has mushroomed. Solar-powered television and wind-up radios are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Annex VI&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
also making inroads. Mobile TV (plugged into a generator) is now available in Mopti.&#13;
Inter-personal, traditional and entertainment communication which can motivate and&#13;
present action messages in a culturally appropriate way, will be given a primary role.&#13;
(The Strategie national dI'EC adopted by the Direction Nationale de Planification in&#13;
1994 recommends giving special emphasis to traditional channels.) Local radio will be&#13;
used whenever feasible, given its proven effectiveness with low-literacy audiences in&#13;
Mali.&#13;
*  Technical, extension and "sensibilization" staff from Government agencies are an&#13;
important source of information on new practices for villagers. The CDAs' activities&#13;
need to complement or be complemented by those of the ministries of rural&#13;
development, health and education -- this coordination is crucial to success.&#13;
*  Technical agencies with food production/consumption responsibilities often act in&#13;
isolation from each other. Focusing disparate food security and nutrition efforts of&#13;
concerned technical agencies on a few key behavior change targets holds promise, if&#13;
they cooperate with one another. Tentative efforts to bring concerned partners involved&#13;
in the chain of food production to consumption (ministries of Agriculture, Health and&#13;
Social Action, NGOs and women associations) together, both at the national level and in&#13;
Mopti, have recently been initiated by UNICEF. The CDAs should be kept advised of&#13;
developements in this regard..&#13;
State-of-the-Art Communication Methodologies&#13;
Most new ideas and practices are introduced into the villages training and face-to-face&#13;
"animation" by specially-hired field staff. As the National Nutrition Plan of 1995 observes, this&#13;
results in a limited audience and impact; for example, the health talk monologue typically given to a&#13;
group of mothers rarely results in modifying behavior. Introducing other mutually-supportive&#13;
channels and communication techniques can be expected to significantly increase the impact of&#13;
existing education efforts. Including appropriate Government service staff in the training of the&#13;
NGO-CD, who supervises the CDA, will increase the likelihood of project impact.&#13;
Availability of IEC Materials&#13;
* A national inventory and critical assessment of social sector IEC materials was prepared&#13;
during project preparation. Well-designed and audience-tested materials exist for a&#13;
limited range of topics, including: family planning, AIDS prevention, infant feeding&#13;
and breastfeeding, immunizations, and oral rehydration therapy (ORT).&#13;
Approach&#13;
Successful programs have been characterized by a number of key elements: social&#13;
mobilization, social marketing, rigorous planning and good program management, market research,&#13;
and mixed media. This approach has been used successfully in Mali in a number of sectors,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

namely family planning by the AMPPF, the contraceptive marketing effort, ORT and breastfeeding&#13;
campaigns coordinated by CNIECS, and the Nutrition Communication Project funded by USAID&#13;
and now supported by UNICEF. Evaluation of these efforts, each with different audiences, different&#13;
behavior change objectives, and using different mixes of media have documented positive changes&#13;
in behavior. All have used a consumer-oriented planning approach based on social marketing&#13;
principles. A brief discussion of the principal elements with underlie these part efforts and which&#13;
will guide the project follows:&#13;
Social Mobilization: This is a process of generating interest, demand and support for program&#13;
activities. To be effective, social mobilization must involve a wide range of people and&#13;
institutions, including local political and religious leaders and health and education officials,&#13;
the media, development agencies working with the population, private sector institutions and&#13;
community leaders (including leaders from the community mnost affected by the program&#13;
activities). Social mobilization tends to work best when handled by individuals who know the&#13;
local situation and can effectively link into existing local communication and authority&#13;
networks. Often, social mobilization entails building the capacity of local leadership.&#13;
Social Marketing: This is an audience-based approach which applies commercial marketing&#13;
principles to social products and/or ideas. The underlying pirinciple is that individuals will&#13;
adopt new practices, such as an improved pesticide to contrcl crop pests, modify dietary&#13;
practices to include more vegetables from commercial gardens; use improved seeds; introduce&#13;
new crop varieties; or apply a new technology such as solar drying to preserve vegetables, if&#13;
certain conditions are right. The product must be perceived as useful, and its benefits clearly&#13;
established. The price, in both cash, time and effort must be affordable. The distribution&#13;
system needs to provide easy access to the products promoted or materials required to put the&#13;
action in place. And useful, credible and attractive information must be available in a form&#13;
easily understood.&#13;
Rigorous Planning: There are six important steps to assure a behavioral change program&#13;
which is relevant to the needs and perceptions of the audienc.e and which penetrates deeply&#13;
and extensively into the community: (i) adequate research to understand the socio-cultural and&#13;
economic context which new ideas will be introduced; (ii) communication planning - the use&#13;
of research results to set objectives and plan an approach; (iii) materials development; (iv) pre-&#13;
testing behavior change concepts, practices and materials conveying these ideas; (v)&#13;
implementation of training for inter-personal programs and clissemination of materials and&#13;
information; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation to track perlormance and make corrections if&#13;
messages are not understood or are not reaching their intended user.&#13;
Market Research: Research is the key to understanding the audiences' beliefs, attitudes and&#13;
practices so that a few, doable actions are identified for promotion; so that the right mix of&#13;
media (traditional, inter-personal and mass) is used to get the message out; and so that this&#13;
information is directed to the most appropriate people -- not always the mother for health&#13;
messages, or males on agricultural topics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Annex VI&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Mixed Media: The hallmark of successful communication programs has been their balanced&#13;
use of mass media, inter-personal communication, support media and traditional media. A&#13;
mix enables a program to reach large numbers of people, with sufficient frequency and&#13;
personal relevance. Touching the target audience at different moments over the course of the&#13;
day with different types and levels of information is an important aspect.&#13;
Description of Project Activities&#13;
Social Mobilization Strategy&#13;
Communities: The project's core premise and main objective is the mobilization of&#13;
communities as partners in development. A dialogue about the project will be part of the initial&#13;
discussions with selected villages. Understanding community's responsibilities for the sub-project&#13;
and that further project investments in their community is contingent on how well the first&#13;
investment is managed will be key. These are new concepts in a country beginning to build the&#13;
foundations for a civil society. While hard to generalize, at least three separate discussion-phases&#13;
would be appropriate. This initial "needs assessment phase" will be conducted by a consultant,&#13;
selected on the basis of its experience in participatory methods and prefereably in the region. A&#13;
methodology and objectives for these assessments is presented in Annex V and will be adapted with&#13;
experience.&#13;
Actors in project implementation: The Manual of Procedures developed for the project&#13;
details the system of competitive bidding that will be used to select intermediaries and service&#13;
providers (including the NGO-CD) for the various elements of the sub-projects and accompanying&#13;
interventions. The project will put in place an information dissemination system to assure that&#13;
eligible groups are informed about the project and aware of opportunities to bid. It will rely on the&#13;
most widely-used communication media to elicit as broad a response as possible; special focus will&#13;
be given to reaching organizations already working in the region of intervention. This aspect of the&#13;
project will test communication mechanisms based on publicity strategies of ongoing programs (e.g.&#13;
of AGETIPE and the Education Pivot Group), namely: (a) press: announcements in the major&#13;
newspapers; (b) radio: announcements over Radio Television du Mali's "Avis de Communiques" or&#13;
similar programs of local radio stations; (c) NGO newsletters; and (d) communications to bilateral&#13;
agencies who support local NGOs and maintain regular contact with them.&#13;
Government regional technical staff (teachers, agricultural extension agents, health care&#13;
workers): Strategies will include briefings by the NGO-CD at the arrondissement level and periodic&#13;
updates on project results. They will receive progress reports on key indicators in their area of&#13;
responsibility, along with a reminder about their role in improving the trend and what they could do.&#13;
NGO community: NGOs are key actors in mobilizing communities for action. It will be&#13;
important to keep NGOs (both regionally and nationally) abreast of project progress through the&#13;
various coordinating bodies (CCA-ONG, SECO-ONG, the four Pivot Groups). The Project&#13;
Specialist in Community Development will prepare short communiques for various NGO&#13;
newsletters and bulletins.&#13;

Behavior Change (IEC) Strategy&#13;
The project offers an opportunity to address poverty; food insecurity and malnutrition in a&#13;
concerted fashion. Construction of basic infrastructure and investment in productive activities can&#13;
be linked with messages of a social benefit nature. The IEC behavior change program will have as&#13;
one of its long-term goals to encourage these synergies. For example, construction of wells and&#13;
development of vegetable gardens are opportunities for introducing changes related to hygiene and&#13;
dietary diversification. Behavioral change messages will be defined within the context of selected&#13;
villages by the community with the help of the CDA and NGO-CD. Given the current practices and&#13;
attitudes of the village, the NGO-CD will (i) explore with the population what kinds of actions are&#13;
doable in the given environment to bring about the desired improvements; (ii) identify specific&#13;
behaviors and practices to be promoted by the Project by target groups; and (iii) conduct short&#13;
"trials" of the proposed behaviors by households and the community. Based on two needs&#13;
assessment in Mopti during project preparation, an indicative list of behavior change areas are&#13;
shown below, with the intervention category they are linked to:&#13;
wells               hygiene&#13;
diarrheal disease control/ORT/excliLsive breastfeeding&#13;
water-borne disease prevention&#13;
chlorinization of drinking water&#13;
irrigation/water    malaria control&#13;
management         water-borne disease prevention conservation practices&#13;
vegetable gardens   dietary diversification and infant feeding practices&#13;
food security:      improved agricultural and animal husbandry practices, food&#13;
processing and preservation techniques&#13;
health facilities   breastfeeding&#13;
ORT and household hygiene&#13;
immunizations&#13;
family planning and other health topics&#13;
education/literacy  all above items&#13;
cereal banks        infant feeding practices; maternal nutrition&#13;
The IEC behavior change interventions will continue after completion of sub-project&#13;
construction activities. The NGO-CD will provide beneficiary villages with IEC messages for a&#13;
maximum of 18 months, based on a work plan it submits to the PMO. The supervision for the&#13;
period post-construction will either be handled by the NGO-CD, the intermediary, the PMO or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;

some other mechanism, as the situation warrants. Because sub-projects will be initiated at different&#13;
periods, different batches of projects will have different time frames for their IEC&#13;
activities. The last batch of sub-projects will, it is assumed, be launched no later than 12 months&#13;
before project completion. This should be long enough to begin shifting behaviors for the last set of&#13;
villages, given the fact that the IEC modules will have been tested and revised and ready for&#13;
immediate use. Annual knowledge, attitudes and practices surveys will allow for IEC feedback, and&#13;
opportunities to modify specific programs.&#13;
A master behavior change strategy will be developed by the Project's Specialist in&#13;
Community Development, with the assistance of an IEC advisory group (consisting of practitioners&#13;
from NGOs and public technical services) for each of the above mentioned topical areas. This will&#13;
include identification of: (i) priority behavior change objectives and messages; (ii) key decision-&#13;
makers for each topic and those who influence them; and (iii) a mix of communication channels to&#13;
effectively and efficiently reach each decision-making group in the population. Appropriate visual,&#13;
graphic and other culturally appropriate support materials will be identified and kept on the "shelf'&#13;
for use in whatever combination is needed&#13;
IEC Topics and Materials&#13;
The project will initially rely on behavior change strategies and IEC materials already&#13;
developed and used by others. Relevant materials are available on infant and maternal feeding&#13;
practices, diarrheal disease control, family planning, and AIDS prevention. These include flip&#13;
charts, counseling cards, booklets for new literates, as 20-part radio series on feeding practices.&#13;
It is anticipated that 2-3 new behavior change topics, with accompanying IEC materials and&#13;
messages, will be either significantly improved or developed over the course of the Project. Given&#13;
the high level of community demand for well construction, and water management/irrigation&#13;
activities, priority attention will be given to practices tied to: hygiene, prevention of diarrhea&#13;
(including promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and use of ORT), malaria and water-borne&#13;
diseases. These are areas for which considerable formative research, materials development and&#13;
testing have already been done by the Ministry of Health and NGOs. There is also a considerable&#13;
body of international and Bank experience in this sector which the project will draw upon.&#13;
Based on initial community demand studies, the agricultural sector (especially cereal banks,&#13;
vegetable gardens and irrigated perimeters) is another priority area for IEC. Although the&#13;
agricultural sector has depended primarily on extension and demonstration as vehicles for improving&#13;
practices, an end-user-driven approach is being tried in some parts of the extension system. New&#13;
extension "messages" will be designed to respond to perceived farmer problems, and agricultural&#13;
agents from project areas will transmit these messages to appropriate village audiences. The PAIB&#13;
'will coordinate closely with the PNVA regarding its IEC program and choice of communication&#13;
channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Annex VI&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
Any improvement in food production will need to give attention to ways of supporting&#13;
female farmers and the special problems that confront them. The Rapport national sur la situation&#13;
desfemmes au Mali (Commissariat a la Promotion des Femmes, 1995) estimates that&#13;
70% of the country's food is produced by women. Women work on family and community plots as&#13;
well as have responsibility for their own parcels -- and they are responsible for much of vegetable&#13;
production. Extension services directed to women have lagged as has agricultural research to&#13;
develop practices and equipment suitable for application on small parcels, often cultivated by&#13;
women. IEC interventions will work with agricultural specialists arid women farmers to develop&#13;
practical advice geared to their needs. Experience of the Bank-funded PCAP provides a point of&#13;
departure.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation: IEC message delivery should be monitored and evaluated in&#13;
terms of performance. Learning what works, what does not work, and why is especially important&#13;
during the first phases of the project. For example: Is the agricultural extension agent a credible&#13;
source of information on food consumption? Are the hygiene support materials easy to use and&#13;
appropriate in the normal routine? What suggestions do CDAs have for improving the product?&#13;
Evaluation criteria have been built into the project's M&amp;E system. They are designed to measure&#13;
changes in Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices, as well as exposure of the population to the&#13;
intervention.&#13;
In the early stages of the project, there will be more intensive IEC monitoring. The&#13;
Specialist in Community Development in the PMO will devote one week each calendar quarter&#13;
during the first year to provide feedback on IEC interventions. (This is in addition to the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation activities detailed in Annex XIV.) Observation, focus group discussions, and other&#13;
rapid appraisal methods will be used to obtain qualitative information about the communication&#13;
activities at the village level. A journal of findings and observations will be kept. Recommendations&#13;
for corrective action will be made to the Director General of the PMO.&#13;
Operations Research&#13;
Given the importance of the participatory methodology employed, consideration should be&#13;
given to continuous experimentation with different approaches. Experience in villages will&#13;
determine approach for subsequent areas; the process will be refined over time. Such work will be&#13;
conducted by a group with experience in operations research in collaboration with those operating in&#13;
the area and who are willing to test methodologies other than their own.&#13;

Training Program&#13;
Introduction&#13;
As part of the effort to build local capacity to combat poverty and hunger, the project plans&#13;
to: (i) improve skills, and management capabilities of beneficiary groups; and (ii) train service&#13;
providers to professionalize the support they provide at the community level. The project will also&#13;
promote close working relationships among NGOs and Government technical services in the field&#13;
by involving the latter, especially those in services dealing with health, rural development, education&#13;
and infrastructure, in relevant training activities, such as participatory techniques and IEC methods.&#13;
In light of the ongoing decentralization process, the project will enhance the coordination and&#13;
monitoring capacity of the CLDs and CRDs in sub-project implementation. The following is a brief&#13;
synopsis of the functional role of the two key project stakeholders and an assessment of their&#13;
training needs (details of the training program are found below):&#13;
-  Beneficiary communities. As the beneficiary community will play a critical role in the&#13;
decision-making process throughout project intervention, the project will provide the&#13;
following training: (i) skill-training related to the operation, maintenance and utilization&#13;
of the end-products of the various infrastructure; (ii) capacity building in functional&#13;
literacy and management for member of the village management committee; and (iii)&#13;
training of a village animation agent in community development, particularly in the&#13;
delivery of IEC messages;&#13;
-  NGO-CD and CDAs. The project will rely on local NGOs to sensitize village&#13;
beneficiaries on the Project, conduct participatory assessments to identify priority needs;&#13;
facilitate village management committees; help frame and implement sub-projects;&#13;
conduct long-term IEC activities to support the community-requested interventions; and&#13;
train the village animation agent in community development. The NGO Capacity&#13;
Assessment found a varied range of technical capacity among the more than 600&#13;
national NGOs and a keen interest in professionalizing their operations (Annex 11). As&#13;
expected, the gap in terms of funding, experience and management capacity is wide&#13;
between national and international NGOs and among the national NGOs themselves.&#13;
The project's initial focus will be to upgrade skills of the most viable local NGOs -- the&#13;
estimated one-third that have more than five years project implementation experience,&#13;
and that are, thereby, eligible to provide services under the project. Generic training&#13;
needs identified as high priority include project planning and proposal writing;&#13;
management; project monitoring and evaluation; participatory community assessment&#13;
and planning; and training methodologies based on adult learning principles. To&#13;
implement sub-projects at the community level, local NGOs will also need training in&#13;
use of "Best IEC Practices", as well as proven techniques for improving management&#13;
skills of beneficiary groups.&#13;
&#13;

Training Activities&#13;
The training program must find a way to effectively deal with (i) different levels of trainees;&#13;
and (ii) the variety of subject areas covered by the project. The main categories of trainees include&#13;
the communities, NGOs specializing in community development (NGO-CD), and community&#13;
development agents (CDAs). Intermediaries will also receive brief training in the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system and the preparation of bids/contracts according to Bank requirements. The&#13;
broadly different training requirements calls for expertise in multiple subject areas, including topics&#13;
as diverse as functional literacy, pump maintenance, inter-personal communication skills, proposal&#13;
writing techniques, and behavioral change techniques. The Specialist in Community Developement&#13;
in the PMO will be responsible for synthesizing identified training needs, organizing Training of&#13;
Trainers Workshop for the NGOs-CD drawing on resource persons from public and private&#13;
institutions in Mali, and monitoring training activities at all levels. The PMO will also develop a&#13;
series of training modules on: (i) general presentation of the project; (ii) community development,&#13;
including inter-personal communications techniques, community organizational methods, and&#13;
gender analysis; (iii) participatory methods; (iv) IEC message delivery; and (v) module on&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the sub-projects.&#13;

Observatoire du Developpement Humain Durable&#13;
Presentation et justification&#13;
La lutte contre la pauvrete, reconnue comme l'axe central de la politique de developpement&#13;
au Mali, a besoin d'un systeme d'analyse et de suivi des conditions de vie des menages pour aider&#13;
directement les decideurs a la definition des politiques, a l'allocation des ressources et a l'evaluation&#13;
de l'impact de ces politiques. Les informations pertinentes existent pour la plupart: elles proviennent&#13;
de la Direction Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Informatique (DNSI), des services des Ministeres&#13;
techniques (Sante, Education, Developpement rural, etc.), des services specialises comme le SAP, le&#13;
SIM, l'Observatoire de la main-d'oeuvre et de 1'emploi, les ONG, etc. Ce sont des informations&#13;
statistiques provenant d'enquetes representatives aupres des menages comme l'EBC, I'EMCES ou&#13;
l'EDS, ou de systemes administratifs comme les ministeres techniques ou des informations&#13;
qualitatives. Elles ont trait aux revenus, au depenses, a l'emploi, a la sante, a l'education, aux&#13;
variables demographiques, aux conditions de la femme, a l'environnement, a l'acc&amp;s a l'information,&#13;
etc. Par le passe, un effort pour analyser et synthetiser ces informations a et6 fait, comme, par&#13;
exemple, I'Evaluation des conditions de vie au Mali par la Banque mondiale en 1993, le Profil de la&#13;
pauvrete en 1993 avec l'appui du FED ou le Bilan-diagnostic de la situation du developpement&#13;
humain au Mali r6alise par la DNSI en 1995 sur financement UNICEF/PNUD dans le cadre de&#13;
l'elaboration d'une strategie et d'un Plan d'action de lutte contre la pauvrete et la preparation de la&#13;
Table ronde sur la pauvrete. Cependant, il n'y a pas de mecanisme permanent pour assurer la&#13;
publication reguliere de ce type de rapport, et pour assurer le suivi de la situation sociale et des&#13;
conditions de vie des populations maliens pour fournir aux decideurs l'information dont ils ont&#13;
besoin sous la forme appropriee et dans les delais requis.&#13;
Dans l'Evaluation des conditions de vie, il avait ete propose la creation d'une "Unit6 de&#13;
suivi et d'analyse de la pauvrete" pour pallier ce manque d'analyse et de suivi permanent. De&#13;
meme, dans le Plan d'Action pour l'operationalisation du concept de Developpement Humain&#13;
Durable (DHD), il a et6 retenu la mise en place d'un Observatoire du DHD. A la suite des r6unions&#13;
avec les cadres du Commissariat au Plan et du PNUD, un document de presentation de&#13;
l'Observatoire a e  redige et approuve. En octobre 1996, l'Observatoire a ete cree par Decret&#13;
96/273/PM-RM et les modalites de son fonctionnement et de son organisation ont ete fixees par&#13;
decret 96/274/PM-RM. Cette annexe presente les principaux caracteristiques de l'Observatoire du&#13;
developpement humain au Mali.&#13;
Objectifs de l'Observatoire&#13;
Le principal objectif de l'Observatoire du developpement humain au Mali est d'analyser les&#13;
informations existantes en vue d'ameliorer la d6finition, la mise en oeuvre et l'evaluation des&#13;
politiques, des programmes et des projets centres sur la lutte contre la pauvrete. L'Observatoire&#13;
fournira aux decideurs des informations fiables et pertinentes et sous une forme appropriee pour leur&#13;
permettre:&#13;
* de suivre dans le temps l'evolution des conditions de vie des populations relativement a&#13;
la pauvrete et au developpement social;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
Annex VIII&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
* de mesurer l'impact des politiques, des programmes et des projets en cours relatifs A la&#13;
lutte contre la pauvrete sur les conditions de vie des populations;&#13;
*  de definir, de cibler et de planifier les politiques, les programmes et les projets relatifs A&#13;
la lutte contre la pauvrete et d'en prevoir les consequences probables sur les conditions&#13;
de vie des populations.&#13;
Activites de l'Observatoire&#13;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, l'Observatoire accomplira les taches suivantes:&#13;
*  reunir, valider et faire la synthese de l'information existante, quantitative comme&#13;
qualitative relative aux conditions de vie des populations et produire une serie&#13;
d'indicateurs relatifs a la pauvrete et au developpement humain;&#13;
*  faire la synthese des analyses existantes; conduire des analyses complementaires&#13;
relatives en particulier aux determinants de la pauvrete et des mecanismes d'exclusion&#13;
qui seront regroupees dans un Programme bi-annuel d'etudes;&#13;
*  traduire ces analyses en termes operationnels pour orienter la prise de decisions, pour&#13;
evaluer l'impact des politiques, et prevoir les consequences des mesures envisagees;&#13;
*  mener des analyses en utilisant la methodologie des systemes d'informations&#13;
geographiques, afin d'aboutir A un systeme de ciblage geographique A proposer aux&#13;
utilisateurs;&#13;
*  proposer un programme d'etudes et d'enquetes qualitatives et quantitatives aux&#13;
diff6rents producteurs d'informations pour ameliorer le suivi et l'analyse de la pauvretd&#13;
et du developpement humain;&#13;
*  diffuser les resultats de la maniere la plus large et la plus adaptee possible;&#13;
*  produire et publier chaque ann6e, A date fixe, le Rapport sur le developpement humain&#13;
au Mali. Ce rapport se situe dans la suite de 1 'Evaluation des conditions de vie au Mali&#13;
(1993), du Profil de la pauvrete (1993) et du Bilan-diagnostic de la situation du&#13;
developpement humain au Mali (novembre 1995). Le Rapport se composera d'une&#13;
partie descriptive de la situation socio-economique qui sera mise ajour chaque annee,&#13;
d'une partie qui regroupera les analyses et les recomnnandations en terme de politiques&#13;
axdes sur un ou plusieurs themes et une annexe statislique. La date de publication du&#13;
Rapport sera fixee en fonction de la disponibilite des donnees et de leur utilisation&#13;
potentielle comme la mise au point du budget de l'Etat par exemple;&#13;
*  publier en cas de besoin des etudes sur des sujets specifiques dans le cadre du&#13;
Programme bi-annuel d'etudes.&#13;
L'objectif de l'Observatoire etant d'apporter aux decideuirs une information pertinente,&#13;
I'utilisation effective des donnees dans la definition des politiques, programmes et projets fera&#13;
l'objet d'une evaluation particuliere A chaque presentation du rapport.&#13;

Programme bi- annuel d'etudes&#13;
En plus de la synth&amp;se des analyses existantes, I'Observatoire conduira un programme&#13;
d'etudes charge de mieux comprendre les mecanismes de la pauvrete. Ce programme sera presente&#13;
au&#13;
Comite d'orientation du DHD et de lutte contre la pauvrete pour approbation. II sera bi-annuel pour&#13;
assurer une coherence et un fil directeur dans les etudes.&#13;
Cadre institutionnel&#13;
L'Observatoire est un service rattache au Ministere de I'Economie, du Plan et de&#13;
l'Integration. Pour lui permettre de mener a bien sa tache et dans le cadre d'une etroite&#13;
collaboration, la Direction Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Informatique (DNSI) lui fournira les&#13;
informations disponibles et necessaires a la bonne execution de ses missions. A cet effet, le&#13;
Ministere de l'Economie, du Plan et de l'Integration en tant qu'organe de supervision des deux&#13;
entites organisera au terme d'un texte interne leurs relations. L'Observatoire entretiendra egalement&#13;
des relations de travail et de collaboration avec la Direction Nationale de la Planification (DNP) et&#13;
avec les autres producteurs d'informations. Le pilotage de l'Observatoire est assure par les ComitMs&#13;
d'orientation et de Suivi du DHD et de lutte contre la pauvrete aupres de la Primature.&#13;
L'Observatoire soumettra officiellement le Rapport sur la situation socio-economique au Mali aux&#13;
Comites d'orientation et de suivi. L'Observatoire pr6sentera au Comite d'orientation pour&#13;
approbation le plan du Rapport de l'annee suivante ainsi que le programme d'etudes. L'Observatoire&#13;
est appuye egalement par un Reseau de partenaires.&#13;
Organisation et fonctionnement&#13;
L'Observatoire comprend un Directeur, de formation economiste, qui est responsable de: (i)&#13;
la r6alisation du Rapport annuel; (ii) la qualit6 et de la pertinence des travaux de l'Observatoire; (iii)&#13;
des relations avec les producteurs d'information et les utilisateurs des travaux de l'Observatoire; (iv)&#13;
la diffusion des travaux de l'Observatoire; (v) la coordination des travaux effectues par les agents de&#13;
l'Observatoire; et (vi) la saine gestion et la bonne march de l'Observatoire. Un sociologue, un&#13;
informaticien et un documentaliste completent l'equipe. Le personnel de l'Observatoire renforcera&#13;
sa competence en effectuant des voyages d'etudes et en suivant des formation specialisees aupres&#13;
d'organismes internationaux.&#13;
En outre, I'Observatoire recrute pour des periodes limitees des consultants nationaux ou&#13;
internationaux afin de realiser les etudes du Programme bi-annuel d'etudes et d'apporter a&#13;
l'Observatoire l'assistance requise en matiere de methodologie d'analyse economique et sociale en&#13;
vue d'assurer la qualite scientifique des travaus de l'Observatoire. Ces consultants peuvent etre&#13;
detaches des ministeres techniques ou autres parties de l'administration. Ils sont remuneres par&#13;
l'Observatoire durant leur periode d'affectation.&#13;

Reseau de l'Observatoire&#13;
L'Observatoire pourra b6neficier selon les besoins, d'appuis ponctuels ou permanents&#13;
d'experts qui seront charges de lui apporter l'assistance requise en matiere de methodologies&#13;
d'analyse economique et sociale, et pour la revision des rapports que produira l'Observatoire en vue&#13;
d'en assurer la qualite scientifique.&#13;
Comme l'Observatoire utilisera les informations recueillies par d'autres institutions ou&#13;
organismes, la bonne qualite des relations avec ceux-ci est fondainentale pour le succes de&#13;
l'Observatoire. De meme, les d6cideurs sont l'audience privil6giee de l'Observatoire. Ces deux&#13;
interlocuteurs de l'Observatoire seront organises en un Reseau de l 'Observatoire qui comprendra&#13;
des membres de I'Administration et ses services specialises, des ONG, des instituts de recherche, de&#13;
la societe civile, du secteur prive, des institutions regionales (comme I'AFRISTAT), etc.&#13;
Le Directeur de l'Observatoire s'attachera tout particuliirement a la reussite de cette&#13;
collaboration qui est un lieu de dialogue entre producteurs et utilisateurs des donnees. Les&#13;
partenaires situes dans les regions feront egalement l'objet de relations suivies. Le Reseau de&#13;
l'Observatoire se reunira deux ou trois fois par an pour evaluer l'etat d'avancement des travaux, et&#13;
discuter et resoudre les eventuels problemes.&#13;

Diffusion&#13;
La diffusion des publications de l'Observatoire sera particulierement large: Gouvernement,&#13;
societe civile, ONG, bailleurs de fonds, secteur prive, instituts de recherche, universite, etc. A partir&#13;
du Rapport, differents produits seront crees et adaptes aux differents utilisateurs: resumes,&#13;
presentation informatique (de type PowerPoint), disquettes, articles, cartes, etc. Des seminaires de&#13;
presentation seront organises, au niveau national et regional. Un cadre de l'Observatoire sera&#13;
particulierement responsable de cette activite.&#13;
Sources de donnees&#13;
L'Observatoire n'a pas la vocation de conduire lui-meme des enquetes, mais aura pour tache&#13;
de synth6tiser les donnees existantes. Cependant, il pourra recommander la realisation d'enqu8tes&#13;
qualitatives et quantitatives dans des domaines precis, ou des modifications dans la collecte des&#13;
statististiques venant de l'Administration&#13;
Programme indicatif annuel de travail&#13;
Le programme indicatif de travail de l'Observatoire comprendra d'une maniere generale les&#13;
activites suivantes:&#13;
*  Elaboration de plan du Rapport sur le developpement humain du Mali;&#13;
*  Elaboration du Programme bi-annuel d'etudes;&#13;
,  Presentation du Programme bi-annuel d'etudes et du plan du Rapport de l'annee en&#13;
cours au Comite d'Suivi pour approbation;&#13;
*  Realisation des etudes et redaction du Rapport provisoire;&#13;
*  Revue et commentaires des membres du reseau et du Comite du Suivi;&#13;
*  Redaction du Rapport final;&#13;
*  Presentation du Rapport annuel au Comite d'Orientation;&#13;
*  Tenue de seminaires nationaux et regionaux de presentation du Rapport et diffusion.&#13;
Etudes de base&#13;
Dans le but de mieux definir le programme d'activites de l'Observatoire, il est prevu de&#13;
lancer trois etudes preparatoires en liaison avec la DNSI:&#13;
* Evaluation des besoins des utilisateurs et les indicateurs ai suivre: cette evaluation&#13;
permettra de mieux pr6ciser les besoins des differents utilisateurs et de proposer une&#13;
serie d'indicateurs socio-economiques que l'Observatoire suivra d'une maniere&#13;
permanente, en particulier ceux relatifs a l'indice du developpement humain durable.&#13;
Inventaire des sources d 'information qualitatives sur la pauvrete: cette etude vise a faire&#13;
l'inventaire des sources d'information qualitatives sur la pauvrete y compris les services&#13;
gouvernementaux, les ONG, les instituts de recherche, la societe civile, etc.&#13;
&#13;

Budget et plan de financement&#13;
Le budget de l'Observatoire comportera le cofit du personnel, I'eventuelle refection de&#13;
locaux, les dquipements, la diffusion et les frais de fonctionnement ainsi que le financement du&#13;
programme bi-annuel d'etudes. II est co-finance par le PNUD et la Banque mondiale.&#13;
Au fur et A mesure que l'Observatoire produira l'information demand6e, les autres bailleurs&#13;
de fonds pourront apporter leur contribution A son financement. Le but ultime est que l'Observatoire&#13;
fasse preuve de son efficacite et soit finance ulterieurement par le budget regulier du Gouvernement.&#13;
Evaluation et perennite de l'Observatoire&#13;
Une evaluation du travail de l'Observatoire et de la perfirmance de ses cadres aura lieu&#13;
chaque annde. De plus, une evaluation technique de son impact sera conduite A mi-parcours par un&#13;
organisme independant au regard de l'utilisation effective par les decideurs des donnees produites&#13;
par l'Observatoire. A l'issue de cette evaluation, une decision sera prise sur les modalites&#13;
d'institutionnalisation de l'Observatoire, sa taille et son mode de financement.&#13;
Avantages et risques&#13;
L'Observatoire permettra de valoriser les informations existantes en favorisant leur&#13;
utilisation systematique par les decideurs; il remplira le r6le de lien entre producteurs et utilisateurs&#13;
de donnees en mettant I'accent sur la demande de l'information. II est A craindre cependant que son&#13;
champ de competence soit elargi au suivi de phenomenes non directement lies a la pauvrete.&#13;
La creation de l'Observatoire ne devra pas etre cependant vue comme le palliatif A tous les&#13;
travaux d'analyse faits dans les autres institutions du pays. Au contraire, il devrait etre percu&#13;
comme leur "vitrine". Les relations entre ces institutions et l'Observatoire seront le point critique du&#13;
fonctionnement de l'Observatoire et tous les partenaires devront renforcer ce lien.&#13;

PREAMBULE&#13;
Le present Manuel de Procedures est partie integrante du Projet d'Appui aux Initiatives de Base&#13;
dans la Lutte contre la Faim et la Pauvrete (PAIB) mis en oeuvre par le Gouvernement de la&#13;
R6publique du Mali avec la contribution des Communautes villageoises associees au Projet et le&#13;
financement complementaire de I'Association Internationale de Developpement (IDA), Groupe de la&#13;
Banque Mondiale.&#13;
Ce Manuel de Procedures est prepare par le Gouvernement et s'articule autour de cinq sections:&#13;
Section I:    contexte du Projet&#13;
Section 11:   les acteurs du Projet&#13;
Section III:   les phases de deroulement des sous-projets&#13;
Section IV:   les procedures administratives et financieres&#13;
Section V:    les procedures de passation et de gestion des marches&#13;
Ces sections decrivent respectivement les modalites et les procedures de gestion du Projet, de telle&#13;
sorte que chaque acteur dans le projet - qu'il appartienne aux instances centrales ou deconcentrees&#13;
du gouvernement ou A la societe civile (ONG et Communautes villageoises) -- dispose d'une&#13;
description detaillee de son r6le dans le Projet.&#13;
Du fait de la nature participative du Projet, la preparation de ce Manuel a fait l'objet de discussions&#13;
approfondies entre le gouvernement et les ONG et sa version provisoire a ete testde pendant la&#13;
periode 1996-1997 A l'occasion de la phase pilote du Projet. La version finale, qui comprend des&#13;
ameliorations r6sultant des lecons apprises au cours de la phase pilote, a e  approuvee par le Comite&#13;
de Pilotage du Projet (comportant des representants du gouvernement et des ONGs).&#13;
Les dispositions contenues dans ce Manuel ont et6 egalement approuvees par l'IDA et sont incluses&#13;
dans I'Accord du Credit que l'lDA octroie au Gouvernement du Mali pour le financement du PAIB.&#13;
Pour cette raison, toute modification au present Manuel de Procedures de la part du Gouvernement&#13;
requiert la non-objection prdalable de l'IDA.&#13;

SECTION I: CONTEXTE DU PROJET&#13;
1.1.   Resume des objectifs du Proiet. Les objectifs du Projet d'Appui aux Initiatives de Base&#13;
dans la Lutte Contre la Faim et la Pauvret6 (le Projet) sont: (a) I'amnlioration des conditions de vie&#13;
des communaut6s rurales ciblees les plus defavorisees en apportant une reponse a leurs besoins&#13;
prioritaires; (b) le renforcement des capacites des communautes pour accroitre leur participation&#13;
dans la preparation et la realisation des actions appropriees pour r6pondre a ces besoins ; (c) le&#13;
renforcement du partenariat entre les communautes, les ONG et le Gouvernement par une&#13;
collaboration a la base dans la lutte contre la pauvrete ; (d) le renforcement des capacites&#13;
institutionnelles et les mecanismes de prise de decision aux niveaux local et national en ce qui&#13;
concerne la lutte contre la faim et la pauvrete.&#13;
1.2.   Resume des activites du Projet. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, le Projet finance deux&#13;
composantes: (a) le developpement communautaire dans des zones rurales ciblees et (b) un appui&#13;

Ce Manuel se concentre sur la premiere composante, qui inclut des Sous-Projets, identifies,&#13;
proposes et mis en oeuvre par les Communautes rurales ciblees. Pour etre finances par le Projet, les&#13;
sous-projets doivent repondre aux besoins consideres prioritaires par ces Communautes.&#13;
1.3.   D6finition d'un Sous-Projet. Un Sous-Projet est constitue d'un ensemble d'interventions&#13;
comprenant generalement un investissement physique et des actions d'accompagnement permettant&#13;
aux communautes villageoises d'utiliser et d'exploiter efficacement l'investissement physique. Un&#13;
Sous-Projet n'est pas seulement une operation d'infrastructure.&#13;
1.4.   Strategi . La strategie du Projet se base sur une approche participative qui met la&#13;
communaute au centre de tous les efforts. Elle consiste a: (a) appuyer les initiatives prises par les&#13;
communautes de base dans les villages pauvres et (b) utiliser pleinement, coordonner et&#13;
eventuellement renforcer les capacites des differents partenaires des communautes de base. Pour&#13;
cela, le projet s'appuiera sur les trois processus suivants:&#13;
*  le processus de participation des communautes beneficiaires dans l'identification, la mise en&#13;
oeuvre et le suivi des sous-projets visant a lutter contre la pauvrete au niveau de leur&#13;
communaute;&#13;
*  le processus de mise en oeuvre des sous-projets visant a renforcer les capacites des&#13;
communautes dans l'execution des sous-projets;&#13;
*  le processus de collaboration communaute's/ONG/Gouvernement aux niveaux  local,&#13;
regional et national dans la mise en oeuvre du Projet.&#13;
1.5    Domaines d'intervention. Les domaines d'intervention du Projet resultent des priorites&#13;

2.12   PRINCIPES DEONTOLOGIQUES.&#13;
Collegialement et individuellement, les membres ou personnels du CP, des comites locaux, du BGP,&#13;
et des intermediaires, sont appeles A exercer leur jugement en reference aux principes de reference&#13;
suivants:&#13;
*  Independance: Seul le BGP est habilite A decider des choix de sous-projets et actions; le&#13;
BGP ne peut contracter que des actions conformes A l'Accord de Credit;&#13;
* Impartial it: dans leurs relations avec les tiers, qu'il s'agisse des beneficiaires du Projet,&#13;
des fournisseurs et prestataires de services du Projet, ou de toute personne ou institution&#13;
interessee A quelque titre que ce soit au projet ou A ses resultats, I'AIB, les comites locaux,&#13;
le BGP, et les intermediaires pour ce qui les concerne, ne pratiquent aucune forme de&#13;
discrimination ou de traitement preferentiel; ils appliqueront exclusivement les procedures&#13;
de decision et de choix decrites dans le present Manuel;&#13;
*  Efficacite: la recherche de I'efficacit6 maximale par rapport aux objectifs generaux, decrits&#13;

83&#13;
SECTION III&#13;
LES PHASES DE DEROULEMENT DES SOUS-PROJETS&#13;
3.1.   SELECTION DES COMMUNAUTES BENEFICIAIRES&#13;
a)     Methode de classement et de ciblage. Le ciblage des villages repose sur deux classements&#13;
successifs. Tout d'abord, on classe les arrondissements du plus pauvre au moins pauvre selon un&#13;
indice de ciblage qui combine des indices concernant la sante, la malnutrition, I'education, I'acces a&#13;
l'eau potable, le risque alimentaire, et les depenses de consommation. On attribue ensuite A chaque&#13;
village un score selon l'acces pour la population du village A certaines infrastructures de base. Les&#13;
villages les plus pauvres sont ceux qui appartiennent aux arrondissements les plus pauvres et qui ont&#13;
le score le plus faible. Ce classement sera realise par la Direction nationale de la statistique et&#13;
l'informatique (DNSI) et le Systeme d'alerte precoce (SAP). Les details de la methode figurent en&#13;
Annexe 1. La methode est approuvee par le CA sur proposition du BGP et pr6sentation par la DNSI&#13;
et le SAP&#13;
b)     Villages cibles par le PAIB. Pour le PAIB, le ciblage des villages parmi les villages les plus&#13;
pauvres dependra d'autres facteurs relatifs A l'execution des sous-projets du PAIB. Ces facteurs&#13;
additionnels prendront en compte, par exemple, la proximite des villages entre eux, leur&#13;
accessibilite, 1'existence d'autres projets, etc. Le nombre des villages d'intervention ddpendra&#13;
egalement du programme annuel du PAIB, qui sera propose annuellement par le BGP et approuve&#13;
par leCA.&#13;
c)     Sensibilisation des villages cibles et Demande d'appui. Des la selection des villages cibles,&#13;
ceux-ci recoivent une visite d'information du BGP sur: (i) 1'existence du projet, (ii) ses objectifs,&#13;
(iii) le type d'appui qu'il est susceptible de leur apporter, (iv) la fa,on de demander l'appui, (v) les&#13;
crit6res et les modalites d'evaluation et d'approbation des Demandes d'Appui pour un Sous-Projet&#13;
(DASP). La diffusion de l'information - comprend, A chaque phase, la remise A toutes les&#13;
Communautes cibles d'un modele standard de DASP conforme au modele figurant en Annexe 4.&#13;
Cette etape est sous la responsabilite du BGP qui s'appuiera localement sur les CRD et les CLD&#13;
concernes.&#13;
d)     Preparation et soumission des Demandes d'Appui. Les DASP sont preparees par les&#13;
communautes des villages cibles et sont transmises au BGP. Les communautes qui expriment un&#13;
interet pour l'appui du PAIB et presente un DASP feront l'objet d'une enquete participative (dont&#13;
les objectifs et methodologies sont definies en annexe no 2).&#13;
3.2.   MISE EN PLACE DU SYSTEME DE GESTION DES SOUS-PROJETS&#13;
a.    Identification des Maitres d'Ouvrage De16gues (MOD) potentiels. Au debut du projet, le&#13;
BGP constitue un registre des organismes interesses et competents susceptibles d'assurer la fonction&#13;
de MOD dans le Projet. Pour cela, il publie un Appel d'Expression d'Interet (AEI) sur la base du&#13;
modele figurant en Annexe no 7, qui d6finit les missions confi6es a un MOD et les criteres des&#13;
qualifications requises pour les assurer. Parmi les reponses re,ues, sont retenus dans le registre les&#13;
organismes dont les capacites techniques et financieres repondent aux criteres. Celles-ci sont&#13;
evaluees par une Commission comprenant des representants du BGP, du Ministere du tutelle et de&#13;
personnes ressources specialistes de l'analyse des capacites financieres et de gestion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
b.     Decomposition en lots des missions de MOD. Apres reception des Demandes d'Appui, le&#13;
BGP regroupe les villages potentiels en lots sur une base geographique ou sectorielle. En fonction&#13;
du nombre de sous-projets A financer, il recrute un ou des TMODs pour gerer les contrats de&#13;
prestation de service et de travaux de ces lots.&#13;
c.     Procedure de recrutement. Les MODs sont recrutes par competition en utilisant la procedure&#13;
de Selection Basee sur la Qualite et le Cout (SBQC) mise en oeuvre par le BGP. La Lettre&#13;
d'Invitation (LDI), conforme au modele standard de l'IDA, est transmise par le BGP A une liste&#13;
restreinte d'organismes etablie A partir du registre des MOD prealablement constitue et mis a jour&#13;
par le BGP comme indique ci-dessous en 3.3.a. Les Termes de Reference du MOD precisent le&#13;
nombre indicatif de sous-projets et le type de contrats (ONG-DC, MO et entreprises) A gerer. Le&#13;
montant des contrats dont la gestion est deleguee au MOD est estime par le BGP sur la base des&#13;
couits moyens des phases precedentes du projet (y compris la phase pilote). Les candidats A la&#13;
fonction de MOD feront une offre technique et une offre financiere pour leurs honoraires. Les&#13;
offres financieres superieures A 10% du montant des contrats A gerer seront ecartees.&#13;
d.     Evaluation des offres. Les offres sont evaluees conibrmement aux procedures et de&#13;
passation des marches de services de consultant prescrites dans 5.1.c par un Comite Technique&#13;
d'Evaluation comprenant des representants et du BGP de l'Auditeur en qualite d'observateurs, et en&#13;
cas de besoin avec l'assistance de personnes ressources. Les offres techniques seront evaluees en&#13;
premier lieu; puis les offres financieres. Au terme des travaux de la commission, l'auditeur&#13;
soumettra au BGP un rapport sur la regularite et transparence de l'evaluation des offres.&#13;
e.     Revue prealable de l'IDA. Dans la mesure ou les documents de consultation sont standards,&#13;
la proc6dure de s6lection n'est revue par l'IDA qu'aux etapes de (i) la liste restreinte; (ii)&#13;
l'evaluation des offres techniques ; (iii) 1'evaluation combinee (olfre technique et offre financiere) et&#13;
la selection du candidat. Aprbs non objection de l'IDA sur ces etapes, le Directeur General du BGP&#13;
signe des conventions de MOD avec les soumissionnaires retenus, comformement au modele&#13;
figurant en Annexe 13. Cette Convention sera completee par les Accords de Sous-Projets signes&#13;
entre les communautes beneficiaires et le BGP, et vises par le CLiD.&#13;
3.3. MISE EN PLACE DES ONG-DC AUPRES DES COMMUNAUTES&#13;
a.     Recrutement des ONG-DC. Le BGP etablit un registre des ONG-DC ayant exprime leur&#13;
interet pour une mission de Developpement Communautaire dans le projet, sur la base des reponses&#13;
a un Appel d'Expression d'Interet (AEI) publie dans la presse nationale, conforme au modele en&#13;
Annexe 9A, et definissant les criteres de qualification requis. La liste est mise A jour chaque ann6e&#13;
par le BGP par re-publication de l'AEI. Les competences techniques des ONGs sont evaluees par&#13;
une Commission comprenant des representants du BGP et des MOD potentiels. Le MOD procede au&#13;
recrutement d'une ou de plusieurs ONG-DC pour les services decrits dans les Termes de Reference&#13;
en Annexe 11, que les ONG-DC devront assurer aupres des communautes dont les sous-projets&#13;
constituent le lot pour lequel le MOD a ete recrute. Les ONG-DC sont recrutees par comp6tition en&#13;
utilisant la procedure de Selection Basee sur la Qualite et le Cout (SBQC) mise en oeuvre par le&#13;
MOD. La Lettre d'Invitation (LDI), conforme au modele standard de l'IDA, est transmise par le&#13;
MOD A un nombre restreint d'ONG, dont la liste est etablie a partir du registre des ONG-DC&#13;
prealablement constitue et mis A jour par le BGP comme indique ci-dessus.&#13;
b.     Evaluation et approbation des offres. Les offres sont evaluees par un Comite Technique&#13;
d'Evaluation (CTE) comprenant des representants du MOD conformement aux procedures de&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85&#13;
passation et de gestion des marches de services de consultant decrites dans la 5.1.c. Le rapport du&#13;
CTE est soumis A l'approbation du Directeur General du BGP.&#13;
c.     Revue pr6alable. Dans la mesure ou les documents de consultation sont standards, la revue&#13;
prealable de l'IDA ne portera pas sur les LDI ni les TDR, mais sur les listes restreintes et les&#13;
rapports d'evaluation des offres pour la premiere annee du projet dans la limite des seuils indiques&#13;
(fans l'Accord de Credit. En fonction du resultat de cette premiere annee, la revue prealable de l'IDA&#13;
pourra etre convertie en revue a post6riori.&#13;
d.     Mise en place de l'Agent de Developpement Communautaire (ADC). Des signature de son&#13;
contrat, chaque ONG-DC recrute un ADC qui aura la responsabilite d'assurer un appui permanent&#13;
aupres des Communautes tout au long de 1'execution de leur sous-projet, conformement aux taches&#13;
prescrites par les TDR de l'ONG-DC figurant en Annexe no 11.&#13;
3.4. IDENTIFICATION ET PREPARATION D'UN SOUS-PROJET&#13;
a.     Evaluation participative des besoins prioritaires. La premiere etape de la preparation de&#13;
chaque Sous-Projet est l'identification des actions prioritaires que le PAIB financera. A cet effet, le&#13;
13GP recrute immediatement apres la selection des communautes cibles, un consultant (ONG ou&#13;
]3ureau d'etudes) pour les assister A identifier leurs besoins prioritaires. L'ONG-DC participe A cet&#13;
exercice, dont la methodologie figure en Annexe 2.&#13;
b.     Etude de Faisabilite. L'evaluation de la faisabilite technique economique et sociale du sous-&#13;
projet identifie est effectuee par la Communaute dans le cadre de l'enquete participative, avec&#13;
I'appui de l'ONG-DC et le conseil des Services Techniques regionaux et locaux de l'Administration.&#13;
Cette evaluation est conduite A I'aide de Fiches types d'Evaluation de Faisabilite (FEF) mises A la&#13;
disposition du consultant par le BGP. Pour chaque type de sous-projet, une FEF specifique fournit&#13;
les differentes carateristiques d'un ouvrage standard et des mesures d'accompagnement pouvant &amp;re&#13;
associees, et les criteres de faisabilite: (i) institutionnelle, par exemple, les criteres de la carte&#13;
scolaire ou de la carte de sante pour l'implantation d'un nouvel equipement; (ii)technique, par&#13;
exemple, les conditions de site, la nature des sols requise, les quantites de materiaux et de main&#13;
d'oeuvre qualifiee et non qualifiee exigees par unite (s'il s'agit d'un barrage ou d'une piste, il s'agit&#13;
d'unite de longueur); (ii) financiere, c'est A dire le cout total de l'operation, sa decomposition entre&#13;
materiaux locaux et non locaux, main d'oeuvre qualifiee et non qualifiee et la repartition possible de&#13;
ces couts entre la Communaute (sous forme de travail ou de materiaux) et l'entreprises;&#13;
(iii) economique, en particulier les benefices escomptes et les charges recurrentes nouvelles&#13;
generees par le fonctionnement du nouvel equipement; et (iv) sociales, notamment la faisabilite de&#13;
l'effort de la communaute, liee en particulier aux calendriers agricoles. Ces fiches, validees par les&#13;
ministeres techniques concernes, sont utilisees par leurs services deconcentres pour la validation des&#13;
investissements physiques prevus dans les sous-projets.&#13;
c.     Requete des communautes. Le sous-projet considere prioritaire par une communaute et dont&#13;
la faisabilite est 6tablie par rapport aux criteres FEF fait l'objet d'une requete par cette communaute&#13;
qu'elle soumet au BGP avec les rapports des etudes de faisabilite.&#13;
d.     Procedure d'Approbation. Une Commission Technique d'Evaluation (CTE), composee des&#13;
MOD et du BGP, se reunit pour selectionner les sous-projets soumis, qui repondent aux criteres&#13;
d'e6igibilite figurant en Annexe 17. Les sous-projets retenus par la CE sont approuv6s par le BGP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
sous reserve des resultats de l'etude technique et des disponibilit6s financieres. Pour ces sous-projet,&#13;
le MOD procede alors au recrutement du Maitre d'Oeuvre (voir para 3.6). Pour les sous-projets non&#13;
retenus, la CE formule des commentaires et recommandations A l'attention de la Communaute.&#13;
e.     Calendrier. Les decisions d'approbation des sous-projets par le BGP sont prises au plus tard&#13;
30 jours pour compter de la date de reception par le BGP, d'une requ8te de financement soumise par&#13;
la communaute concernee et validee par le CLD. Le modele de cette requete figure en annexe no 5.&#13;
3.5    MISE EN PLACE DES MAITRES D'OEUVRE&#13;
a. Recrutement des Maitres d'Oeuvre. Le BGP etablit un registre des BET competents dans les&#13;
differents secteurs susceptibles d'interesser le Projet et ayant exprime leur inter8t pour une mission&#13;
de Maitrise d'Oeuvre dans le projet, sur la base des reponses A un Appel d'Expression d'Inter8t&#13;
(AEI) publie dans la presse nationale, conforme au modele en Annexe no 9 et definissant les criteres&#13;
de qualification. La liste est mise A jour chaque annee par le BGP par re-publication de l'AEI. Les&#13;
competences techniques des BET sont evaluees par une Commission comprenant des representants&#13;
du BGP assistes, autant que de besoin, par des personnes ressources competentes dans les secteurs&#13;
consideres. Le MOD procede au recrutement d'un ou de plusieurs MO pour les prestations dans les&#13;
Termes de Reference figurant en Annexe 16. Les MO sont recrutes par competition en utilisant la&#13;
procedure de Selection Basee sur la Qualite et le Cout (SBQC) mise en oeuvre par le MOD. La&#13;
Lettre d'Invitation (LDI), conforme au modele standard de l'IDA, est transmise par le MOD A un&#13;
nombre restreint de BET, dont la liste est etablie de preference A partir du registre des BET&#13;
prealablement constitue et mis A jour par le BGP.&#13;
b.     Evaluation et approbation des offres. Les offres sont evaluees par un Comite Technique&#13;
d'Evaluation (CTE) comprenant des representants du MOD conformement aux procedures de&#13;
passation et de gestion des marches de services de consultant decrites dans 5.2.c. Le rapport du&#13;
CTE est soumis A l'approbation du Directeur G6neral du BGP.&#13;
c.     Revue prealable. Dans la mesure oa les documents de consultation sont standards, la revue&#13;
prealable de l'IDA ne portera pas sur les LDI ni les TDR, mais sur les listes restreintes et les&#13;
rapports d'evaluation des offres pour la premiere annee du projet dans la limite des seuils indiques&#13;
dans l'Accord de Credit. En fonction du resultat de cette premiere annee, la revue prdalable de l'IDA&#13;
pourra 8tre convertie en revue a posteriori.&#13;
3.6.   ETUDE TECHNIQUE DETAILLEE&#13;
a. Objectif de l'Etude Technique Detaillee. L'etude technique detaillee des travaux d'un sous-&#13;
projet inclut autant que de besoin les 6tudes d'environnement cle l'ouvrage (resistance des sols,&#13;
pedologie, topographie, hydrologie, etc.), les 6tudes architecturales et d'ingenierie de l'ouvrage&#13;
(r6sistance des materiaux, etudes de b6ton, etc). Elle calcule en detail les quantites de materiaux,&#13;
6quipement et travail, elle estime les couts previsionnels et planifie le calendrier previsionnel des&#13;
travaux en fonction des differentes contraintes de personnel et d'approvisionnement des materiaux.&#13;
En particulier, elle etudie en detail la repartition des taches entre la, Communaute et l'entreprise pour&#13;
eviter, autant que possible, les chevauchements et l'imbrication des deux (par exemple, s'il est&#13;
prevu que la communaute fournisse des materiaux, elle le fait avant l'intervention de 1'entreprise).&#13;
La partie concernant la contribution villageoise estime en detail le nombre de personnes xjour etlou&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
les quantites, qualite et localisation des materiaux a fournir, et planifie le calendrier en fonction des&#13;
autres activites de la Communaute.&#13;
b.     Approbation de l'Etude Technique. L'etude technique, y compris 1'estimation financiere des&#13;
travaux est soumise au cas ou la legislation nationale l'exige, au visa des Services Techniques&#13;
deconcentres des Administrations competentes. Elle est ensuite transmise au BGP, pour approbation&#13;
finale du sous-projet.&#13;
c.     Accord de sous-projet. Un accord de sous-projet est signe par la communaute et le BGP,&#13;
vis6 par le CLD pour les sous-projet approuves, conforme au modele figurant en Annexe 6.&#13;
d.     Revue pr6alable. Tous travaux d'un montant estime superieur au seuil indique dans l'Accord&#13;
de credit seront soumis a la non objection prealable de l'IDA avant d'etre definitivement acceptes.&#13;
3.7.   REALISATION DES INVESTISSEMENTS PHYSIQUES&#13;
a.     Objectif de la realisation des travaux. L'entreprise a pour mission de realiser les travaux&#13;
prevus dans le sous-projet dont la technicite, le volume et la complexite ne sont pas a la portee de la&#13;
Communaute. Ces travaux sont decrits par les plans et les specifications techniques du Dossier&#13;
d'Appel d'Offres (DAO) prepar6 par le MO, selon les regles de l'art et un modele qui sera approuve&#13;
par ]'IDA et annexe au present manuel.&#13;
b.     Recrutement de l'Entreprise. Les DAO resultant des etudes techniques d6taillees sont&#13;
prepares par les MO pour l'ensemble des ouvrages a construire d'un meme type ou des&#13;
amenagements a realiser de meme nature. Chaque DAO groupe les travaux en Lots, en fonction de&#13;
leur proximite geographique.&#13;
c.     Revue pr6alable. Tout marche d'un rnontant superieur au seuil indique dans l'Accord de&#13;
credit est soumis a la non-objection de l'IDA avant sa signature par le MOD.&#13;
d.     Realisation des travaux. Les travaux de la communaute sont fournis par celle-ci&#13;
conformement aux specifications de l'etude technique, ainsi que le stipule l'Accord de Sous-Projet.&#13;
L'organisation des travaux est discutee et arretee par le Comite de Gestion du Projet de la&#13;
communaute avec I'ADC et le MO. Les travaux de l'entreprise sont executes conformement au&#13;
marche de travaux entre l'entreprise et le MOD.&#13;
e.     Suivi des travaux. Les travaux de la communaute sont suivis, sur le plan technique par le&#13;
MO avec la collaboration de 1'ADC. Les travaux de l'entreprise sont suivis par le MO et le&#13;
representant la communaute designe pour cela par son Comite de Gestion du Projet. La conformite&#13;
des travaux de l'entreprise avec les specifications techniques du DAO et la qualite de leur execution&#13;
sont contr6les par le MO au cours de reunions de chantier hebdomadaires. Le MO certifie la&#13;
conformite des ouvrages avec les specifications techniques et 1'exactitude des decomptes de travaux&#13;
etablis par 1'entreprise pour paiement par le MOD.&#13;
f.     Reception des travaux. Apres leurs receptions provisoires, les ouvrages sont remis a la&#13;
communaute par le BGP. Le delai de garantie des travaux par l'Entreprise est de 12 mois. Les&#13;
receptions provisoires et definitives sont prononcees par le MOD en presence de la communaute, du&#13;
BGP, du CLD et des repr6sentants des services techniques deconcentres concernees, qui signent&#13;
leurs proces-verbaux.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88&#13;
g.     Supervision. La supervision de I'avancement du programme de travaux est assure par le&#13;
MOD dans le cadre de sa convention avec le BGP. De son cete, le BGP assure egalement une&#13;
supervision generale de l'avancement de l'ensemble des programmes delegu6s aux MOD.&#13;
3.8.   SUIVI ET EVALUATION&#13;
a.     Objectif et outils&#13;
Le suivi/evaluation consiste a (i) arreter de facon participative une liste d'indicateurs en fonction des&#13;
besoins en information de tous les acteurs ; (ii) collecter des donnees en vue de calculer les valeurs&#13;
de ces indicateurs ; (iii) analyser ces valeurs pour:&#13;
*   mieux fixer les objectifs aussi bien pour les sous-projets que pour le projet,&#13;
et mesurer leur degre d'atteinte&#13;
*   analyser les forces et faiblesses des modes d'execution pour prendre des mesures&#13;
d'amelioration de la mise en oeuvre des actions,&#13;
* adapter l'execution des sous-projets aux circonstances et contextes particuliers.&#13;
- tirer des enseignements enrichissant pour leur lar,ge diffusion aupres des&#13;
beneficiaires et de tous les intervenants dans les initiatives des base.&#13;
Le suivi/lvaluation est conduit a tous les niveaux, a l'aide d'un ensemble de fiches permettant de&#13;
collecter les donn6es et informations necessaires au calcul des indicateurs:&#13;
*   fiches de suivi-execution reparties en fiches journalieres et hebdomadaires de&#13;
collecte et en fiches mensuelles d'agregation des donnees sur les activites de&#13;
mise en oeuvre des sous-projets,&#13;
* fiches de suivi-impact pour cerner la situation socio-economique des&#13;
beneficiaires, les capacites des differents partenaires avant et apres les sous-&#13;
projets.&#13;
b.     Mode d'execution&#13;
Le mode operation s'articule autour de 3 etapes:&#13;
Etape 1: Mise en place du systeme au niveau local&#13;
Les ADC une fois installes dans les villages, exposent aux populations les objectifs, la&#13;
methodologie, l'importance du suivi-evaluation, ainsi que la signification et l'interet de&#13;
chacun des indicateurs. Ils les assistent dans la selection d'un nombre limite d'indicateurs&#13;
dont les modes de calcul sont simples et qui sont adaptes au contexte de la communaute, a la&#13;
nature de son sous-projet, et susceptibles d'etre compris aisement en langue locale. Les&#13;
ADC forment ensuite les Animateurs Villageois de Develappement (AVD) et les&#13;
responsables des travaux dans l'utilisation des outils (remplissage des fiches, methode de&#13;
calcul et d'agregation des indicateurs, methode d'analyse et de restitution des tendances&#13;
observees, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89&#13;
Etape 2: Collecte et traitement preliminaire des informations&#13;
Les fiches hebdomadaires de collecte sont remplies par les ADC avec l'assistance des AVD,&#13;
des responsables des travaux, les membres competents des comites de gestion. Chaque fin&#13;
du mois, les donnees des fiches hebdomadaires sont a leur tour agregees.&#13;
Les tendances resultant de ces agregations sont discutees hebdomadairement et&#13;
mensuellement avec les intervenants, les AVD, les representants des communautes pour&#13;
identifier les points forts et les points faibles des activites menees et arreter les mesures&#13;
correctives eventuelles. Les ADC ajustent leurs analyses en fonction des resultats des ces&#13;
discussions et elaborent des rapports preliminaires qu'ils soumettent aux responsables&#13;
competents de l'ONG-DC pour approfondissement.&#13;
Etape 3: Centralisation, traitement et diffusion&#13;
*  Par programme del6gue: Pour chacun des lots, le MOD centralise et analyse les&#13;
rapports mensuels des ONG-DC, procede aux verifications et corrections necessaires,&#13;
discute de ses constats et propositions de mesures avec l'ONG-DC, elabore un rapport&#13;
de synthese couvrant tous les sous-projets du lot qu'il soumet au BGP.&#13;
-  Pour l'ensemble du projet: Les informations fournies par les MOD sont saisies et&#13;
centralisees dans la base de donnees informatisees du BGP qui contient par ailleurs les&#13;
donnees sur la gestion financiere, et en particulier sur la gestion des conventions et&#13;
contrats. Le specialiste en Suivi-evaluation du BGP procede au rapprochement de ces&#13;
donnees avec les indicateurs d'activites operationnelles, et a un rapprochement des&#13;
indicateurs des differents sous-projets pour 6laborer un rapport portant sur l'ensemble&#13;
des activites du projet, assorti des mesures d'ameliorations. Ces mesures, une fois&#13;
approuvees sont communiquees aux responsables et intervenants concernes en vue de&#13;
leur application. Trimestriellement, le specialiste en Suivi-evaluation elabore un rapport&#13;
beaucoup plus axes sur les enseignements permettant d'ameliorer l'execution des&#13;
programmes delegues. Ces enseignements sont diffuses a travers un bulletin&#13;
d'information que le BGP publie periodiquement.&#13;
&#13;

SECTION IV - PROCEDURES ADMINISTRATIVES ET FINANCIERES&#13;
4.1. AU NIVEAU DU BGP&#13;
a.     Gestion. La gestion financiere des fonds du Projet: c'est A dire des fonds du Gouvernement&#13;
au titre de la contrepartie de celui-ci au financement du Projet et du Credit de l'IDA (A l'exclusion des&#13;
apports des communaut6s), est assuree par le Directeur General du BGP. Les fonds de contrepartie&#13;
sont g6res selon les regles de la comptabilite applicable au Mali et conformement aux dispositions du&#13;
Pr6sent Manuel des Proc6dures. Les fonds de l'IDA sont geres ccnform6ment A l'Accord de Credit, au&#13;
Rapport d'Evaluation du Projet, au Manuel de Comptabilite Generale Information Financiere et Audit&#13;
(FARAH), premibre 6dition Janvier 1995.&#13;
b.     Ressources financibres du BGP. Pour financer les activites du PAIB, le BGP dispose des&#13;
fonds de contrepartie du Gouvernement dans le projet -- dont le volume annuel est determine dans le&#13;
Rapport d'Evaluation du Projet (REP) -- ainsi que du Credit de [" IDA.&#13;
*  Les fonds de contrepartie du Gouvernement pour le PAIB sont geres par le BGP qui ouvrira&#13;
un compte (CP) dans une banque commerciale dans leqiiel le Gouvernement transferera par&#13;
tranches les fonds de contrepartie au debut de chaque sernestre.&#13;
*  Les fonds du Credit de l'IDA pour le PAIB sont geres par le BGP. Le BGP ouvrira un&#13;
Compte Special (CS) dans une banque commerciale. A la mise en vigueur du Credit, l'IDA&#13;
d6posera dans le CS un montant initial de 500.000 dollars qui pourra etre port6 A 1.000.000&#13;
dollars EU, correspondant A environ 6 mois des depenses du Projet, dbs que les montant des&#13;
decaissements sur le CS auront atteint 2 millions de dollars.&#13;
c.     Decaissements au niveau central A partir du CP et du CS. Le BGP effectuera, A partir du CP&#13;
et/ou du CS ou par Demande de Paiement Direct (DPD) a l'IDA, les decaissements pour:&#13;
*  le financement des Conventions de Maitrise d'Ouvrage Delegu6e pour la realisation des&#13;
sous-projets selon le principe du "compte roulant" decrit au paragraphe 4.2. A chaque&#13;
paiement, le BGP transferera les fonds necessaires A partir du CS pour la fraction des&#13;
d6penses financees par l'IDA, et A partir du CP pour la ifraction des depenses financees par&#13;
le Gouvernement;&#13;
*  les paiements des honoraires des Maitres d'Ouvrage Delegu6s pour leurs services de gestion&#13;
des contrats qui leurs sont d6legues (finances A 100% par l'IDA);&#13;
*  les paiements de toutes les depenses eligibles pour la coniposante Appui Institutionnel.&#13;
*  le financement des Recherches Op6rationnelles.&#13;
d.     Modalites de decaissement. Les paiements des depenses eligibles au financement du Credit&#13;
de l'IDA seront effectu6s a partir du CS pour les contrats d'acquisition des biens d'un montant&#13;
inferieur A l'equivalent de 100.000 dollars EU et pour les contrats de consultants individuels d'un&#13;
montant inferieur A 50.000 dollars. Au-dela de ces montants, le BGP fera effectuer les paiements sur&#13;
le Cr6dit directement par l'IDA (par la procedure de demande de paiement direct).&#13;
e.     Reapprovisionnement du Compte Sp6cial. Chaque mois, le BGP transmettra A l'IDA une&#13;
demande de r6alimentation du Compte Special sur la base du modble standard de l'IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
91&#13;
4.2.   AU NIVEAU DES MAITRES D'OUVRAGE DELEGUES&#13;
a.     Gestion financiere. Les MOD ont, par del6gation du BGP, la gestion des fonds destin6s au&#13;
paiment des contrats dont ils assurent la gestion (contrats d'ONG-DC, d'Entreprises et de ma1itres&#13;
d'Oeuvres). Pour gerer ces fonds, les MOD ouvriront un compte dans une banque commerciale,&#13;
distinct (du) des autres comptes bancaires du MOD.&#13;
b.     Ressources initiales. Au moment de la signature de la Convention par laquelle le BGP&#13;
delegue au MOD la gestion d'un ensemble de contrats de travaux et de services correspondant A un&#13;
programme determine de sous-projets, le BGP transf&amp;re au MOD une avance de fonds&#13;
correspondant A 30 % du montant total previsionnel de 1'ensemble des contrats du programme dont&#13;
le MOD assurera la gestion. Cette avance sera versee par le BGP contre presentation par le MOD&#13;
d'une caution bancaire couvrant 100 % du montant de l'avance, ou d'une garantie 6quivalente&#13;
acceptable par l'IDA. Pour les avances de demarrage d'un montant ne depassant pas 10% du&#13;
montant du programme delegue, le MOD est dispense de la presentation de la caution bancaire.&#13;
Dans ce cas et lorsque le montant des demandes de paiement des executants d6passe le solde du&#13;
compte du programme delegue, le BGP, apres avoir v6rifi6 la regularite des depenses dejA effectuees&#13;
par un rapprochement bancaire, peut transferer au MOD le montant des demandes de paiement&#13;
certifiees par le MOD pour les maitres d'oeuvre et les ONG-DC et par le MO pour les entreprises.&#13;
c.     Paiements des Contrats. Les MOD assurent le paiement des contrats dont ils assurent la&#13;
gestion dans le cadre de leur Convention de Maitrise d'Ouvrage Deleguee avec le BGP, selon les&#13;
regles suivantes:&#13;
les paiements des services de chaque ONG-DC sont effectues mensuellement par le MOD&#13;
sur la base des factures de l'ONG-DC accompagnees du rapport mensuel d'activit6 de&#13;
l'ONG-DC pour la periode consideree, et des fiches de suivi et evaluation visees par le&#13;
representant de la Communaute. Prealablement au paiement, le MOD s'assure que le rapport&#13;
d'activite rend compte de prestations effectivement realisees par l'ONG-DC. Les activites&#13;
figurant dans le rapport et effectivement realisees seront comparees par le MOD aux&#13;
activites prevues dans le contrat pour la periode couverte par la facture. En cas de difference&#13;
constatee dans l'activit6 de l'ONG-DC, le montant des paiements sera ajuste en consequence&#13;
par le MOD de facon A ce que les paiements correspondent aux services effectivement&#13;
rendus par l'ONG-DC.&#13;
*  Les paiements des travaux de chaque Entreprise sont effectues mensuellement par le MOD&#13;
sur la base d'un d6compte mensuel de travaux presente par l'Entreprise chiffrant les travaux&#13;
realises, certifie par le Maitre d'Oeuvre, avec l'avis du representant de la Communaute&#13;
charge du suivi des travaux.&#13;
*  Les paiements des services de chaque Maitre d'Oeuvre (MO) sont effectues au prorata de&#13;

Le systeme de Suivi &amp; Evaluation (S&amp;E)&#13;
I.     Introduction&#13;
Le Gouvernement du Mali s'engage dans un important programme de lutte contre la&#13;
pauvrete et la faim associant les communautes de base, les organisations non-gouvernementales&#13;
(ONG) et l'Etat. Ce programme s'inscrit dans une nouvelle demarche caracterisee par une&#13;
planification partant de la base, des relations partenariales et contractuelles entre tous les&#13;
intervenants, une etroite complementarite entre des investissemeiits concrets et des actions visant le&#13;
renforcement des capacites organisationnelles et enfin, une decentralisation de la maitrise d'ouvrage&#13;
confiee a des intermediaires. Testes au cours d'une phase pilote, ces divers mecanismes ont mis en&#13;
lumiere la necessite de disposer d'un systeme regulier et continu de suivi &amp; evaluation (S&amp;E) pour&#13;
informer promptement et en temps reel les decideurs responsables aux differents palliers, de&#13;
l'avancement d'un processus tres decentralise et deconcentre vers l'atteinte des objectifs vises.&#13;
Concevoir et mettre en oeuvre un systeme de S&amp;E , comme un systeme d'information utile A&#13;
la decision, fluide, accessible, dynamique est un defi. Les habitudes de travail sont longues et&#13;
difficiles A changer, la technologie liee A la gestion de I'information est nouvelle, le PAIB fait appel&#13;
a une multitude d'acteurs (ONG, Etat, menages, structures sociales traditionnelles, prives) et&#13;
partenaires, motives par des interts differents et dispers6s sur le l:erritoire. Par ailleurs, les systemes&#13;
classiques de S&amp;E, tout comme les services nationaux de statistiques, ont rarement contribue A la&#13;
prise de decision des acteurs de terrain. De nouvelles avenues sont proposees dans le systeme de&#13;
S&amp;E du PAIB.&#13;
II.    Definition et description du systeme de S&amp;E&#13;
Le systeme de S&amp;E con,u pour le PAIB structure et systematise la gestion de l' information,&#13;
en tant qu'outil de prise de decision pour les differents acteurs associ6s au Projet. Un tel systeme&#13;
d'information vise trois objectifs:&#13;
* ameliorer la performance globale des acteurs associes au Projet, A la fois en terme&#13;
d'efficacite dans la preparation et l'execution des activites et dans I'atteinte des objectifs&#13;
developpementaux vises&#13;
* perenniser les actions entreprises par les communautes&#13;
* capitaliser les connaissances acquises de maniere A accelerer le processus de&#13;
developpement initie par le Projet.&#13;
Integre A chacune des etapes clefs du processus de decision, il permet d'identifier clairement&#13;
et systematiquement les informations utiles, et d'assurer la collecte, I'analyse, le traitement et la&#13;
circulation de ces informnations en fonction des besoins specifiques des differents acteurs concernes&#13;
pour orienter leurs decisions vers le succes des actions. Ces informations s'inscrivent dans une&#13;
demarche d'evaluation et d'ajustement continus pour atteindre les resultats escomptes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
103&#13;
Annex XIV&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
Types de suivi&#13;
Pour concevoir le systeme de S&amp;E du PAIB , une premiere distinction s'est averee fort utile,&#13;
celle de definir deux grands types de suivi, chacun correspondant A ce que sous-entend la&#13;
performance d'un projet de developpement:&#13;
(i) le suivi d'execution: I'efficacite dans la mise en oeuvre de realisations concretes&#13;
(ii) le suivi d'impact: l'importance des changements dans le milieu suite A ces r6alisations&#13;
Chacun de ces types de suivi est distinct et fait appel A des variables specifiques, mais ils&#13;
s'inscrivent dans un processus continu de collecte, analyse, evaluation d'informations liees aux&#13;
decisions A prendre A chaque etape du cycle de gestion du Projet.&#13;
En tant qu'outil interne de gestion axe sur les resultats, ils seront realises systematiquement&#13;
par les principaux acteurs du PAIB: les communautes appuyees par l'agent de developpement&#13;
communautaire, les intermediaires, le Bureau de gestion du projet.&#13;
Un suivi externe sera aussi realise par l'IDA, le Ministere de tutelle, ou des etudes&#13;
ponctuelles pour contr6ler effectivement la rigueur des procedures, la transparence et la qualite dans&#13;
l'information qui circule et verifier concretement sur le terrain les realisations et les perceptions des&#13;
beneficiaires sur les changements observes. Ce contr6le peut se faire sur simple echantillon.&#13;
Les indicateurs du sysMime de Suivi &amp; Evaluation: un cadre commun&#13;
Pour mesurer la performance d'un projet comme le PAIB, associant plusieurs intervenants&#13;
responsables, partenaires et motives par des interets differents, divers indicateurs seront requis.&#13;
Mais une longue liste d'indicateurs se revele souvent peu utile si elle ne permet pas d'organiser les&#13;
informations entre elles, de lier les differents elements qui composent un projet, de repondre aux&#13;
attentes des divers intervenants et de tisser un lien commun entre eux pour leur permettre de&#13;
connaitre leurs limites et potentialites individuelles et d'apprecier leurs partenaires.&#13;
A l'instar des deux grands types de suivi identifi6s dans le systeme de S&amp;E, deux grandes&#13;
families d'indicateurs sont definies: (i) les indicateurs d'execution et (ii) les indicateurs de&#13;
developpement (impact), formant un cadre commun, global, systematique, structure permettant aux&#13;
differents acteurs de parler et comprendre le meme langage. Les dix indicateurs cles qui permettent&#13;
une supervision systematique annuelle de 1'ensemble de la performance du PAIB sont les suivant&#13;
(Tableau I presente en sommaire de ces indicateurs):&#13;
(i) Les indicateurs d'execution sont ceux relatifs:&#13;
* aux ressources apport6es par les differents intervenants au projet (input):&#13;
* aux biens et services produits par les differentes activites r6alisees (output) et&#13;
* A l'efficacite des procedures adoptees (processus).&#13;

Indicateurs de processus:&#13;
1. Performance des procedures: il s'agit de donnees qualitatives portant sur le type de retard&#13;
rencontrds dans la mise en oeuvre des differentes activites, et les types de problemes&#13;
rencontres: difficultes, litiges ou conflits dans les partenariats (nature et nombre). La dur6e&#13;

2. Degre de satisfaction des partenaires a I 'approche participative du PAIB: L'approche&#13;
participative souleve beaucoup d'espoirs et vehicule diffirentes valeurs: equite, confiance,&#13;
consensus, satisfaction sur le processus et sur le produit, itransparence, sensibilite aux&#13;
differences culturelles, responsabilit6 de chacun. S'il estl pratiquement impossible de&#13;
mesurer une valeur, il est toutefois envisageable de se pencher sur la portee des differentes&#13;
valeurs vehiculees par le concept pour s'assurer du bon o a mal fonctionnement de cette&#13;
approche. Par exemple, il est possible de demander aux principaux acteurs leur perception&#13;
(echelle de I a 3) du niveau de leur propre satisfaction relativement A l'une ou l'autre des&#13;
valeurs rattachees au concept de participation. Une telle evaluation par les acteurs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

permettrait de corriger la demarche globale du projet, que ce soit au niveau des procedures A&#13;
revoir, de ]'information A diffuser plus largement, des mesures incitatives ou sanctionnantes&#13;
A prevoir, etc.&#13;
Indicateurs d'output:&#13;
1. biens et services produits et taux de realisation (en terme de quantite et qualite appreciee par&#13;
les beneficiaires). Chaque activite realisee dans le cadre du Projet est sous la responsabilite&#13;
d'un acteur specifique et vise A produire un bien ou service quelconque: l'output du Projet.&#13;
Preciser les activites, c'est aussi preciser les realisations reelles du projet, et le p6le de&#13;
responsabilite, ce qui renforce I'acceptation par les divers acteurs que l'obtention de&#13;
resultats fait partie de leurs responsabilites. L'activites est l'unite de base de tout le systeme&#13;
de S&amp;E.&#13;
2. bgnefzciaires touches: le rayonnement du Projet par rapport aux ressources affectees est un&#13;
indicateur clef: ratio utile pour comparer l'opportunite ou la performance de divers types&#13;
d'investissement, en termes sociaux. Les donnees utiles A ce niveau sont les types de&#13;
boneficiaire (individu, institution, communaute, ONG, secteur prive), les groupes socio-&#13;
economiques auxquels ils appartiennent et l'importance relative des femmes.&#13;
(ii) Les indicateurs de developpement (impact), ou de developpement, sont ceux relatifs&#13;
aux changements dans le milieu, induits par les actions r6alis6es dans le cadre du Projet et attendus&#13;
par les differents acteurs concernes. Ils correspondent aux objectifs developpementaux vis6s. Ces&#13;
variables se retrouvent dans les diagnostics de depart et sont generalement evaluees, avec de&#13;
nombreuses difficultes et subjectivites, plusieurs annees apres, par des equipes externes, au moment&#13;
de l'achevement du projet. Une nouvelle avenue tracee par le systeme de S&amp;E est d'introduire dans&#13;
les plans d'activites annuels des principaux acteurs du projet, le suivi et la mesure des changement&#13;
apportes par leurs activites realisees pour leur permettre de ddcider de consolider, modifier, ou tout&#13;
simplement cesser l'activite selon le nombre de benefices observes et de beneficiaires concernes.&#13;
Les indicateurs d'impact identifies au cours de la preparation du Projet sont regroupes&#13;
autour des quatre piliers de la strategie de lutte contre la pauvrete adoptee par le PAIB:&#13;
* amelioration des conditions de vie des communautes rurales pauvres&#13;
* renforcement de leurs capacitds A se mobiliser et A lutter contre la pauvrete&#13;
* promotion de l'association ONG / Gouvernement&#13;
* prise de conscience elargie de la pauvrete et renforcement des capacites de l'Etat A y&#13;
repondre au niveau politique et institutionnel.&#13;
Pour chacun de ces piliers, un ensemble d'indicateurs (au sens de variables permettant de&#13;
mesurer un etat, une evolution ) a ete identifie et dresse une toile de fond commune, globale,&#13;
systematique et articulee des objectifs ddveloppementaux vises par le Projet, mettant en lumiere les&#13;
attentes differentes des acteurs et l'importance des activites venant renforcer les capacites des&#13;
ressources humaines.&#13;

L'analyse de performance du PAIB en matiere d'achevement des objectifs developpementaux vises&#13;
couvrira globalement chacun de ces indicateurs, mais selon une approche participative, c'est -A- dire&#13;
que chaque acteur identifiera les indicateurs qui concernent son activite, A partir de ce cadre de&#13;
ref6rence et determinera les mesures specifiques telles qu'il les percoit. Les indicateurs d'impact ci-&#13;
dessous sont suivis par des exemples illustratifs des donnees identifiables avec les communautes ou&#13;

production, investissement dans restauration des ressources naturelles)&#13;
Indicateurs de renforcement des capacite's locales&#13;
I. organisations fonctionnelles et representatives (ex. nb. de femmes participant aux decisions&#13;
communautaires, nombre d'activites gerees d'une maniere communautaire)&#13;
2. capacites de gestion des conflits et des relations partenariales (ex. nb. d'ententes&#13;
partenariales horizontales avec d'autres collectivites et verticales avec des partenaires au&#13;

III.   Modalites de mise en oeuvre du S&amp;E&#13;
11 existe trois niveaux d'analyse et de decision ou se rencontrent les acteurs du PAIB, et&#13;
pour lesquels des besoins specifiques en information sont identifies: les niveaux local, regional et&#13;
national. A chaque niveau, le systeme de S&amp;E propose de systematiser la gestion de l'information&#13;
par des: (i) fiches syntheses de l'information, (ii) mecanismes d'analyse, de decision et de&#13;
circulation de l'information et (iii) personnes-cles dans la gestion de l'information. Le Tableau 2&#13;
pr6sente une synthese du systeme de S&amp;E. Un outi I participatif sous forme de schema a e&#13;
developpe pour faciliter l'analyse d'impact. Ce meme outil se presente sous une forme accessible&#13;
aux logiciels d'analyse statistique (EXCEL - analyse radar ou "spider web"), et sera incorpore au&#13;
niveau regional, dans la base de donnee S&amp;E du PAIB. Un exemple est presente ici pour un barrage&#13;

IV.   Gestion du systeme de S&amp;E&#13;
Agent de S&amp;E&#13;
L'agent de S&amp;E du PAIB est responsable du developpement et de la mise en oeuvre du&#13;
systeme de S&amp;E pour le Projet. Dans cet esprit, il fait partie d'un reseau informel de responsables&#13;
S&amp;E ayant adopte les memes e'lments de base, ce qui lui permettra de se former aupres de&#13;
collegues vivant les memes preoccupations, de prendre connaissance des resultats obtenus dans&#13;
d'autres projets, et d'enrichir le systeme de S&amp;E. II a pour mandat:&#13;
* de conseiller et former les intermediaires A la gestion de l'information pour axer leurs&#13;
activites sur l'atteinte d'une performance tant au niveau de l'execution que de&#13;
l'impact developpemental vise.&#13;
- de superviser la mise en oeuvre du systeme d'information, en verifiant sur le terrain,&#13;
par echantillonnage, la qualite des donn6es, des analyses et des divers outils utilises&#13;
pour assurer la collecte, I'analyse et la circulation de I'information&#13;
- d'animer le processus de d6veloppement du systeme de S&amp;E: harmonisation&#13;
progressive des unites de mesures identifiees par les communautes pour chacun des&#13;
indicateurs de reference, definition d'une nomenclature commune avec le systeme de&#13;
comptabilite analytique, identification des donnees les plus pertinentes et des analyses&#13;
les plus utiles pour la decision des acteurs; reconciliation des donnees issues du&#13;
terrain avec les donnees provenant des statistiques nationales et des etudes&#13;
scientifiques.&#13;
Les types d'activites que l'agent de S&amp;E est appeIl A realiser sont:&#13;
1. preparation de materiel didactique en S&amp;E&#13;

Methodologie Pour L'analyse Economique Et Financiere Des Sous Projets&#13;
La methode la plus appropriee et la plus utilisee pour I'analyses des sous-projets est&#13;
celle&#13;
qui repose sur le taux de rentabilite interne (TRI) des projets. Cette rentabilite economique,&#13;
lorsqu'elle est mesurable, doit etre le critere financier fondamental pour le choix des&#13;
operations A proposer. Lorsqu'il est impossible de la mesurer, d'autres indicateurs peuvent&#13;
permettre de faciliter le choix (les criteres sociaux ou socio-economiques).&#13;
Methode de calcul du VNA (Valeur Nette Actualisee) et du TRI (Taux de Rentabilite&#13;
Interne)&#13;
Signification economique:&#13;
* La Valeur Nette Actualisee (VNA) est la somme de tous les flux annuels&#13;
actualises du projet, c'est-A-dire les benefices actualises du projet moins les coits&#13;
actualises du projet.&#13;
* Le Taux de Rentabilite Interne (TRI) est le taux d'int6r8t de largent investi&#13;
dans un projet donne.&#13;
Les etapes de calcul&#13;
Etape 1: l'evaluation des cofits et avantages economiques generes par le projet:&#13;
Dans la pratique, on est souvent ramene A deux options: situation avec projet et&#13;
situation sans projet. Pour chaque cas, on quantifie les cofits, benefices et les flux&#13;
par annee, pendant la duree du projet. Ce qui nous permet d'ecrire:&#13;
Cofit du projet      =      Cofit avec projet - Cofit sans projet&#13;
Benefice du projet    =     Benefice avec projet - Benefice sans projet&#13;
Flux annuel du projet =     Benefice du projet - Cofit du projet&#13;
Les couts de la situation sans projet sont souvent nuls. Par contre les avantages&#13;
economiques gen6res par un projet sont A la fois les economies realisees par rapport&#13;
A la situation avec et sans projet.&#13;
Couits du projet: Les estimations des cofits des projets sont souvent basees sur des&#13;
ratios tires A partir d'une exp6rience recente sur le terrains (moyenne des appels&#13;
d'offres recents pour le meme type de projet) ou (la somme des produits 'prix&#13;
unitaire * quantite') si ceux si sont disponibles et actualises. A cela on ajoute en&#13;
general une "provision pour imprevus physiques" de l'ordre de 10 % et les cofits&#13;
d'entretien des ouvrages realises : generalement de l'ordre de (1% par an) par&#13;
rapport au cofit du projet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112&#13;
Annex XV&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
Benefices du projet: L'evaluation des benefices econoniiques generes par un projet&#13;
sont: (i) soit des recettes directes; (ii) soit des depenses evitees par rapport a la&#13;
situation sans projet.&#13;
Etape 2: Actualisation: La valeur d'un montant aujourd'hui n'est pas forcement sa&#13;
valeur dans 3 ou 10 annees futures. En effet, les gains futurs d'une operation sont&#13;
deprecies par rapport aux couits presents. Le taux de conversion est appele taux&#13;
d'actualisation, qui est le taux qui donne la valeur actuelle d'une somme future.&#13;
Dans le cadre des projets finances par la Banque Mondiale, un taux intersectoriel de&#13;
rentabilite minimum est souvent indique. Ce taux dans les pays d'Afrique&#13;
Sahdlienne, est de l'ordre de 10%. Ce taux ne doit pas eb^e confondu avec l'inflation&#13;
: il ne traduit pas seulement une depreciation de la monnaie, mais surtout une&#13;
preference pour I'argent present par rapport a I'argent futur.&#13;
Intirkt economique d'une operation: Un projet est interessant dconomiquement si&#13;
les benefices actualises qu'il genere sont plus importants que ses couits actualises.&#13;
Cette definition appelle les remarques suivantes:&#13;
-  pour la majorite des investissements, les coOts sont mesures aujourd'hui et les&#13;
benefices dans le futur. La determination de P'inter&amp;  economique et&#13;
I'actualisation sont donc lides. C'est ainsi que I'actualisation apparait comme un&#13;
outil permettant de mesurer l'inter8t economique.&#13;
-  L'int6r8t economique d'une operation depend a la fois des flux economiques&#13;
qu'elle gdnere et du taux d'actualisation choisi.&#13;
Pour mieux comprendre ces aspects 1'exemple suivant illustre bien l'importance du&#13;
taux d'actualisation et son effet sur l'investissement initial dans le temps:&#13;

Etape 3. Calcul des indicateurs VNA et TRI&#13;
Valeur Nette Actualisee (VNA): formule d'actualisation: Soient f(0), f(2), ..., f(n)&#13;
des flux (positifs ou n6gatifs) correspondants aux annees 0, 1, 2,..., n. Soit i le taux&#13;
d'actualisation.&#13;
Alors: VNA(i, f(k)) = f(k) / (1+i)k                                 (1)&#13;
C'est la valeur nette actualis6e (VNA) du flux de l'annee k, c'est a dire la valeur&#13;
aujourd'hui, en monnaie d'aujourd'hui, du flux de l'annee k.&#13;
On en deduit, par simple sommation des flux actualises que:&#13;
VNA(i, f(O), ... , f(n)) = Somme ( f(k) / (l+i)k )                  (2)&#13;
Donc c'est la somme de tous les flux annuels actualises du projet, c'est-A-dire les&#13;
benefices actualises du projet moins les couts actualises du projet.&#13;
Exemple simple d'un projet P:&#13;
- Investissement initial: 100 M FCFA&#13;
- B6nefices du projet: 60 la premiere annee, 56 la deuxieme annee.&#13;
- Taux d'actualisation choisi: 10 %.&#13;
- les benefices actualises du projet sont donc : 60 la premiere annee, 51 la deuxieme&#13;
annee (56 / 1.1 0);&#13;
ce qui donne un total: 60 + 51 = 111 M FCFA&#13;
- La Valeur nette actualisee (VAN) est done = 111 - 100 = 11 M FCFA&#13;
L'investissement est rembourse et rapporte un supplement de 11 M FCFA.&#13;
Taux de rentabilite Interne TRI: Soient f(0), f( 1), f(2), ... , f(n) des flux(positifs ou&#13;
negatifs) correspondants aux annees 0, 1, 2,..., n. Le Taux de Rentabilite Interne&#13;
(TRI) associe a ces flux est le taux d'actualisation qui verifie:&#13;
VNA (TRI, f(O), f(1),..., f(n)) = 0&#13;
Exemple:&#13;
J'investis 100 Millions de francs (aujourd'hui) dans l'achat d'une maison. Au bout&#13;
d'un an je revends la maison.&#13;
(i)    si je la revends 120 Millions de francs (annee 1), mes flux sont:&#13;
f(0) = -100 (je depense 100 MF), et la deuxieme annee f(l)  + 120 (je re,ois 120&#13;
MF)&#13;
Le TRI est donc le taux qui annule la fonction VNA (valeur nette actualisde) donne&#13;
par:&#13;
VAN (TRI, f(0), f(l))   -100 +120/(l+TRI) = 0, soit: TRI = (120-100)/100 = 20%,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114&#13;
Annex XV&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
Le TRI de l'operation est donc 20%, ce qui signifie que l'operation me rapporte&#13;
20%.&#13;
(ii)   si je la revends 105 Millions de francs (annee 1),&#13;
de la meme facon: VAN (TRI, f(0), f(l)) = -100 +105/(l+TRI) = 0. et: TRI = (105-&#13;
100)/100 = 5%&#13;
De facon generale: Une operation est rentable seulement si son TRI est superieur au&#13;
taux d'actualisation.&#13;
Typologie des projets a financer dans le cadre du PAIB&#13;
Conformement aux objectifs du projet, il a e  propose, en plus des actions de&#13;
formation et de sensibilisation, de concentrer le programme de lutte contre la pauvrete&#13;
autours des axes principaux comme:&#13;
Les 6coles de base:   La construction, 1'extension ou la rehabilitation de salles de&#13;
classe, bureau et bloc de latrines scolaires. La fourniture des equipemnents necessaires pour&#13;
assurer la scolarisation des enfants et les cours d'alphabetisation au niveau des villages.&#13;
Les centres de sante: La construction, l'extension ou la rehabilitation et&#13;
cquipement de centres de sante primaire et bloc de latrines publiques.&#13;
Les puits:    I'approvisionnement en eau potable en creusant des puits ou par la&#13;
realisation des forages equipes ou par des pompes manuelles.&#13;
Les pistes rurales:   I'amrnagement des pistes rurales pour desenclaver les&#13;
villages et ameliorer l'activite commerciale et agricole.&#13;
Les micro-barrages:  Dans le but d'assurer une securite alimentaire et lutter&#13;
contre la faim, des petites retenues d'eau, des ouvrages anti-erosifs et des amenagements de&#13;
plaines seront r6alises.&#13;
HYPOTHESES DE CALCUL POUR LES INDICATEliRS (TRI, VNA)&#13;
Ce chapitre presente pour des cas typiques de sous-projets: (i) une liste des avantages&#13;
attendus; (ii) la quantification des avantages economiques si possible (a l'exception des&#13;
projets sociaux); (iii) le calcul des indicateurs economiques (TR] et VNA) A partir des&#13;
donnees chiffrees.&#13;

ETUDES DE CAS:&#13;
Rehabilitation un batiment a usage collectif (Salle de classe ou Centre de sante)&#13;
Un bitiment est degrade. Sa duree de vie avant 1'effondrement est estimee A 5 ans. Le&#13;
beneficiaire se demande s'il doit proceder ou non a une rehabilitation.&#13;
Le prix de la construction d'un batiment neuf similaire s'6leve A: 10 M FCFA.&#13;
Le montant des travaux de rehabilitation est estime A: 3 M FCFA.&#13;
Les frais d'entretien sont de l'ordre de 1% par an.&#13;
Les deux options sont donc les suivantes:&#13;
(i) rehabilitation et entretien annuel du batiment; et&#13;
(ii) Pas de travaux effectues, puis reconstruction dans 5 ans, lorsque le batiment sera&#13;
inutilisable.&#13;
Analyse des benefices et des cofits engendres par chaque option:&#13;
(i)    rehabilitation et entretien annuel du Batiment: les cofits sont 3 M FCFA pour la&#13;
rehabilitation, et 0.1 MFCFA par an pour l'entretien. II n'a pas de revenus directs.&#13;
(ii)    pas de travaux: le couit est celui de la reconstruction de d'un batiment neuf: 10 M&#13;
FCFA dans 5 ans. Ce cout est evite si les travaux sont effectues. Ainsi, le cofit de la&#13;
reconstruction evite apparait comme un gain dans notre analyse.&#13;
11 est impossible de comparer ce gain exprime en monnaie future au coat exprime en&#13;
monnaie prWsente sans tenir compte de I'actualisation. Le calcul du TRI est presente dans le&#13;
tableau 1 en annexe.&#13;
Construction d'un batiment neuf a usage collectif (Salle de classe ou Centre de sante)&#13;
Contrairement au cas de la rehabilitation, les constructions neuves des batiments sociaux n a&#13;
pas de justification economiques directe, malgre l'interet socio-economique indeniable.&#13;
Dans ces cas on se contente generalement du respect des criteres socio-economiques et de la&#13;
politique sectorielle en la matiere.&#13;
Pour le cas d'une ecole, nous avons les criteres socio-economiques suivants: taux de&#13;
scolarisation, taux de scolarisation des filles, taux d'alphabetisme. Un exemple typique&#13;
serait de construire une ecole de 3 Salles de classe, I bureau et I bloc latrine.&#13;
- CoOt globale du projet:                   46.591.585 FCFA&#13;
- No. de menages ayant un membre non alphabetise:    200&#13;
- No. d'enfants A scolariser:               120 (40 eleve par classe)&#13;
- Taux de filles A scolariser:              60 %&#13;

Micro-barrage et amenagement de plaines&#13;
Ces op6rations sont en gen6ral tres rentables, du fait que I'activite agricole est la&#13;
principale source de revenu pour les villageois. Les avantages sont essentiellement&#13;
I'augmentation de la production agricoles au niveau des menages. (Dans les 3 cas suivants,&#13;
les estimations dans les calculs suivants ont ete utilisees pour la phase pilote.)&#13;
Micro-barrage&#13;

(i)    Le couit du barrage est de: 14.459.710 FCFA (dont travaux: 5.013.602)&#13;
(ii)   Le cout annuel de 1'entretien est estime a: 5% du couit projet,&#13;
(iii)   Le nombre de menages concernes: 200&#13;
(iv)   Augmentation de revenu annuelle estimee par menage: 130.000 F CFA.&#13;
Espace rizicole&#13;

(ii)   Le couit annuel de 1'entretien est estime a: 5% du couit projet,&#13;
(iii)   Le nombre de menages concernms : 60&#13;
(iv)   Augmentation de revenu annuelle estimee par menage: 58.800 F CFA.&#13;
Perimetre&#13;
Hypotheses de calcul&#13;
(i)    Le cout du barrage est de: 18.661.408 FCFA (dont travaux: 6.935.000)&#13;
(ii)   Le cout annuel de 1'entretien est estim6 A: 5% du coat projet,&#13;
(iii)   Le nombre de menages concernes : 48&#13;
(iv)   Augmentation de revenu annuelle estimee par menage 143.000 F CFA.&#13;
Pour ces trois cas, les calculs sont presentes dans le tableau 2 en annexe.&#13;
OUTIL INFORMATIQUE UTILISE:&#13;
Les tableurs (Lotus, EXCEL, etc.) constituent un outil particulierement adapte, et&#13;
d'utilisation facile pour le calcul et I'actualisation des flux. Les fonctions economiques&#13;
n6cessaires (VNA et TRI) sont incluses dans la plupart de ces logiciels. Dans notre cas nous&#13;
avons utilise EXCEL 5 pour effectuer les calculs.&#13;

            Mali - Grassroots Intiatives to Fight
            Hunger and Poverty
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Grassroots Initiatives to Fight
            Hunger and Poverty Project seeks to: i) improve the living
            conditions of disadvantaged targeted rural communities by
            responding to their priorities; ii) strengthen capacity of
            communities in identifying and ranking their priority needs;
            and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
            and local authorities, to plan, implement, and supervise
            actions to respond to those needs; and iii) strengthen
            institutional and policy-making capacity at the local and
            national levels in the fight against hunger and poverty. The
            project has two components: a) Community development will
            include training for the community and for the NGOs
            recruited for community development activities; an
            information, Education, Communication (IEC) program tailored
            to community needs; and an information campaign to keep the
            public abreast of project development. b) Policy and
            institutional development will strengthen local and national
            decision-making on poverty issues. This component will
            finance the activities of the Observatory for Sustainable
            Human Development, created to provide policy-makers with
            information on poverty issues. This component will also
            support a permanent poverty monitoring system.
