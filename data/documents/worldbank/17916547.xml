            This is a joint meeting of the Executive
            Directors of International Bank for Reconstruction and
            Development (IBRD) and International Development Association
            (IDA), to the recommendation loan to Nigerian for an third
            education project. The post-war rehabilitation and economic
            recovery was virtually completed in Nigeria and that its
            balance of payments was strong thanks largely to the rapidly
            increasing oil revenues. The Government has recently decided
            to purchase, for cash, equity in the oil companies operating
            in Nigeria and there are proposals for investment in
            petroleum based industries, particularly in natural gas. The
            education project, which covers the secondary schools
            enrollment, is less than two percent-one of the lowest in
            the world-will provides about 30,000 additional places in
            secondary schools and bout 6,000 places in primary teachers
            training schools.
