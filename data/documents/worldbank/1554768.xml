FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report. The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.     They  include  several  country  and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis  and  research,  and  on reports   of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
From data on population program expenditures in 46 countries,&#13;
estimates are derived for total expenditures in the major regions of the&#13;
developing world in 1980. In all, about $2 billion was spent by external&#13;
donors and developing country governments on population programs: $1.2&#13;
billion in East and Southeast Asia, $300 million in South Asia, $200 million&#13;
in Latin America and the Caribbean, and $100 million each in the Middle East&#13;
and North Africa and in sub-Saharan Africa. Private family planning&#13;
expenditures, estimated from data on the cost of different contraceptive&#13;
methods and on nonprogram contraceptive use, added over $500 million to the&#13;
total.&#13;
Future resource requirements up to the year 2000 are estimated&#13;
assuming constant costs per contraceptive user, with number of users derived&#13;
from alternative population projections. Contraceptive users will have to be&#13;
2.2 times as numerous in 2000 as in 1980 if the World Bank's standard&#13;
population projection, which builds in some decline in fertility rates, is to&#13;
be met. Users will have to be 2.6 times as numerous to achieve the faster&#13;
"rapid fertility decline" built into the alternative, more optimistic&#13;
projection described in the World Development Report 1984. Resource&#13;
requirements increase proportionally. For the developing world as a whole,&#13;
public expenditures will have to grow at a constant 5 percent a year in the&#13;
standard projection to $5.6 billion in 2000. To achieve a more rapid&#13;
fertility decline, expenditures will have to grow at 7 percent a year to $7.6&#13;
billion in 2000. More than in other regions, expenditures will have to grow&#13;
at a faster rate in sub-Saharan Africa: 10 percent annual growth for the&#13;
standard projection, 16 percent for rapid decline. The projected increases in&#13;
private spending are roughly proportional.&#13;
Alternative estimates are provided under different assumptions: that&#13;
contraceptive-use effectiveness is higher (and that less contraceptive use is&#13;
therefore needed to achieve particular fertility targets); that the total&#13;
unplanned fertility rate (a rate calculated to include all factors except&#13;
contraception) follows a particular time path in each country; and that&#13;
private costs vary in relation to number of users or are equal to program&#13;
costs. The results do not vary greatly from the base projections.&#13;
Acknowledgments&#13;
Nancy Birdsall asked some key questions; Nicholas Prescott did some&#13;
initial work, including estimating expenditures in China, and served as a&#13;
sounding board; Bryan Boulier provided useful advice; and Gayl Ness and his&#13;
associates permitted the use of their data on Asian family planning&#13;
programs. Neither they nor the World Bank is responsible for the conclusions&#13;
drawn, nor for any errors of omission or commission.&#13;

Condense&#13;
A partir de donn6es sur les depenses consacr6es aux programmes&#13;
de population dans 46 pays, on a estime les depenses totales faites a ce&#13;
titre dans les grandes r6gions du monde en d6veloppement en 1980. En&#13;
tout, les donateurs exterieurs et les pays en d6veloppement ont d6pens6&#13;
environ 2 milliards de dollars pour des programmes de population :&#13;
1,2 milliard en Asie de l'Est et du Sud-Est, 300 millions de dollars en&#13;
Asie du Sud, 200 millions de dollars en Am6rique latine et aux Caraibes,&#13;
100 millions de dollars au Moyen-Orient et en Afrique du Nord et egalement&#13;
100 millions de dollars en Afrique au sud du Sahara. Les depenses privees&#13;
de planning familial, calculees d'apres des donnees sur le coat de&#13;
differentes methodes de contraception et sur l'emploi de contraceptifs non&#13;
fournis par les programmes officiels, ajoutaient plus de 500 millions de&#13;
dollars au total.&#13;
On a estime les ressources necessaires au planning familial&#13;
jusqu'en l'an 2000 sur la base de coats constants par utilisateur, le&#13;
nombre d'utilisateurs 6tant calcule dans diverses hypotheses demogra-&#13;
phiques. Pour que l'hypothese type de la Banque, qui projette une&#13;
certaine baisse des taux de f6condit6, se r6alise, il faudra que ces&#13;
utilisateurs soient 2,2 fois plus nombreux en l'an 2000 qu'en 1980; ce&#13;
chiffre passe a 2,6 fois dans lthypoth6se plus optimiste d'une "baisse&#13;
rapide de la fecondit6" decrite dans le Rapport sur le d6veloppement dans&#13;
le monde 1984, et les ressources necessaires augmentent proportionnel-&#13;
lement. Pour l'ensemble du monde en d6veloppement, il faudra que les&#13;
d6penses publiques progressent de 5 % par an en prix constants dans&#13;
l'hypothese type, atteignant 5,6 milliards de dollars en l'an 2000, et&#13;
de 7 % par an pour passer a 7,6 milliards de dollars en l'an 2000 dans&#13;
l'hypoth6se d'une baisse rapide de la f6condit6. C'est en Afrique au sud&#13;
du Sahara que ces depenses devront augmenter le plus vite, de 10 % par an&#13;
dans l'hypothese type et de 16 % par an dans 19hypothese d'une baisse&#13;
rapide de la f6condit6. Les hausses projetees des depenses privees sont&#13;
en gros proportionnelles.&#13;
Des estimations sont faites dans diverses hypotheses - oui l'uti-&#13;
lisation des contraceptifs serait plus efficace (et oU, par cons6quent, il&#13;
faudrait moins de contraceptifs pour atteindre un objectif donne de fecon-&#13;
dit6); oiu le taux naturel de fecondite (taux qui comprend tous les fac-&#13;
teurs sauf la contraception) suivrait une tendance donnee dans chaque&#13;
pays; et oii les coats prives varieraient en fonction du nombre d'utilisa-&#13;
teurs ou seraient egaux aux coats des programmes officiels. Les resultats&#13;
ne varient pas sensiblement par rapport aux projections de base.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
De los datos disponibles sobre los gastos en programas de pobla-&#13;
ci6n en 46 paises se derivan estimaciones de los gastos totales efectuados&#13;
en las principales regiones del mundo en desarrollo en 1980. En total,&#13;
los donantes externos y los gobiernos de los paises en desarrollo gasta-&#13;
ron en programas de poblaci6n unos US$2.000 millones: US$1.200 millones&#13;
en Asia Oriental y Sudoriental, US$300 millones en Asia Meridional,&#13;
US$200 millones en America Latina y el Caribe, US$100 millones en Oriente&#13;
Medio y Norte de Africa, y US$100 millones en Africa al Sur del Sahara.&#13;
Los gastos privados en planificaci6n familiar, estimados a partir de datos&#13;
sobre los costos de diferentes m6todos anticonceptivos y sobre el usc de&#13;
anticonceptivos independiente de los programas, agrega mas de US$500 mi-&#13;
llones al total.&#13;
Las necesidades de recursos hasta el aiio 2000 se calculan par-&#13;
tiendo del supuesto de unos costos constantes por usuario de anticoncepti-&#13;
vos, derivandose el n6mero de usuarios de distintas proyecciones demogra-&#13;
ficas. Para que se cumpla la proyecci6n demografica estandar elaborada&#13;
por el Banco Mundial --que incorpora cierta disminuci6n de las tasas de&#13;
fecundidad--, en el anio 2000 los usuarios de anticonceptivos tendran que&#13;
ser 2,2 veces mas numerosos que en 1980. Para alcanzar la "declinaci6n&#13;
rApida de la fecundidad" incorporada en la proyecci6n alternativa, mas&#13;
optimista, que se describe en el Informe sobre el Desarrollo Mundial 1984,&#13;
los usuarios tendran que ser 2,6 veces mas numerosos. Las necesidades en&#13;
materia de recursos se incrementan en forma proporcional. Para todo el&#13;
conjunto del mundo en desarrollo, los gastos publicos tendrin que aunentar&#13;
en un 5% anual constante en la proyecci6n estandar, hasta un monto de&#13;
US$5.600 millones en el aiio 2000. A fin de lograr una declinaci6n mAs&#13;
rapida de la fecundidad, los gastos tendran que incrementarse en 7% al&#13;
ano, hasta US$7.600 millones en el anio 2000. En Africa al Sur del Sahara,&#13;
mAs que en cualquier otra regi6n, esos gastos deberan aunentar a un ritmo&#13;
ain mas rapido:   en un 10% anual para lograr la proyecci6n estAndar y en&#13;
16% para alcanzar la disminuci6n rapida de la fecundidad. Los incrementos&#13;
de los gastos del sector privado indicados por las proyecciones son apro-&#13;
ximadamente proporcionales.&#13;
Se ofrecen estimaciones alternativas bajo diferentes supuestos,&#13;
a saber: la eficacia en el uso de los anticonceptivos es mayor (y, por lo&#13;
tanto, es menor el uso de anticonceptivos necesario para alcanzar una&#13;
determinada meta en materia de fecundidad); la tasa de fecundidad total no&#13;
planeada (tasa calculada de modo que incluya todos los factores, excepto&#13;
practicas anticonceptivas) sigue una senda cronol6gica particular en cada&#13;
pais, y los costos privados varian en relaci6n con el nuimero de usuarios o&#13;
son iguales a los costos de los programas. Los resultados no muestran&#13;
grandes diferencias respecto de las proyecciones de base.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
This paper provides estimates of population program expenditures as&#13;
well as private expenditures on family planning in the major regions of the&#13;
developing world and projections of future requirements to the year 2000.&#13;
Current expenditures are relatively small compared with expenditures in other&#13;
sectors, such as education and health. Across 13 countries, active family&#13;
planning programs take up only 10 percent of the combined health-family&#13;
planning budgets and less that 0.5 percent of total government budgets&#13;
(Nortman, 1982:59-60). Exact levels of expenditures are, however, difficult&#13;
to ascertain, and various indirect approaches will be used.&#13;
The focus is on population program expenditures generally and not&#13;
solely on family planning. A large part of population spending is for&#13;
delivering contraceptive supplies and services (almost 80 percent of&#13;
population assistance in fact goes for this specific purpose; Office of&#13;
Technology Assessment, 1982) but other activities like training, institutional&#13;
development, and data collection are also supported. A key issue is how to&#13;
allocate joint expenditures, for health and family planning, for instance, or&#13;
for demographic data collection serving several purposes. This issue is not&#13;
directly addressed here, since cross-national data collected by others are&#13;
used and no attempt is made to investigate expenditures in any particular&#13;
country. In the absence of a detailed study, the allocation of expenditures&#13;
to population programs as reported in other sources will be accepted here.&#13;
The developing-country regions covered are: sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
stretching from Mauritania and the Sudan to South Africa; the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa, defined to include, among other countries, Iran, Israel, Turkey,&#13;
Cyprus, and Malta; South Asia, which includes Afghanistan; East and Southeast&#13;
Asia and the Pacific, including Burma and Mongolia and excluding Japan,&#13;
Australia, and New Zealand; and Latin America and the Caribbean, including&#13;
territories like Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, and Martinique.&#13;
Estimates and projections will be made country by country, relying&#13;
partly on equations and relationships estimated across those countries with&#13;
some data. The focus here is on regions rather than countries, but country by&#13;
country estimates should provide more reliable regional numbers, because more&#13;
detailed country information can be incorporated where available and also&#13;
because errors in country estimates may occasionally cancel out. The country&#13;
estimates themselves, in many cases, should have large amounts of error and&#13;
will not be reported.&#13;
Current Public Expenditures&#13;
Data sources&#13;
Three sources give population program expenditures for a number of&#13;
countries: a paper by Speidel (1983), prepared for a workshop on cost-&#13;
effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis in family planning programs; Nortman's&#13;
factbook, Population and Family Planning Programs (Ilth edition, 1982); and a&#13;
data file prepared by Ness and his associates for Asian countries (Ness,&#13;
Johnson, and Bernstein, 1983). Speidel provides 1980 data for 37 countries or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
territories, Nortman for 22 (in ten cases for earlier years), and Ness for 14&#13;
(in three cases for earlier years). Some 1981 data is available Ercm these&#13;
sources9 but because they are relatively sparse only the 1980 date will be&#13;
considered.&#13;
Speidel obtained his information from U.S. Agency for International&#13;
Development (USAID) sources, including reports from missions, and from United&#13;
Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) reports0 He breaks down&#13;
expenditures by source, distinguishing "host country" inputs, USAID bilateral&#13;
funding, USAID central funding, and support from other organizations0&#13;
Nortman's data come from questionnaires distributed by the Population Council&#13;
to appropriate informants, such as family planning program administrators and&#13;
Council field staff. Ness's data come from country by country studies of&#13;
available reports, and are based largely on government statistics. Table 1&#13;
gives per capita expenditures obtained or computed from these three sources&#13;
(using World Bank population estimates where necessary) as well as additional&#13;
data (in the columns headed "Ness(b)" and "Prescott") to be discussed&#13;
shortly. Amounts are in 1980 dollars; figures for earlier years were inflated&#13;
to 1980 values to facilitate comparison. (Appendix Table 1 gives total&#13;
expenditures, government shares of total expenditures, and expenditures per&#13;
contraceptive user provided by or calculated from these sources.)&#13;
The figures reported by Speidel are consistently and often&#13;
substantially higher than the figures from the other two sources0 To attempt&#13;
to resolve the discrepancies, Prescott and Armstrong (1983) independently&#13;
collected expenditure data on a few countries, partly from World Bank reports&#13;
and partly from country sources0 These figures, reported in the "Prescott"&#13;
column, do not clearly support any of the other sources and therefore do not&#13;
resolve the discrepancies. Besides collecting data from internal country&#13;
reports, Ness and his associates also obtained external assistance figures&#13;
from international donors and other outside sources0 Replacing cczntry&#13;
reports with these donor reports leads to substantially higher estimates of&#13;
expenditures (in the "Ness (b)" column)o Ness and his associates now report&#13;
their belief that the higher numbers are more likely to be accurate, because&#13;
recipient governments are seldom fully aware of all the population. assistance&#13;
they receive (Ness and others, 1984).&#13;
Lacking a definitive set of figures, this analysis will rely on&#13;
Speidel's data, supplemented where lacking with the higher figures drawn from&#13;
the other sources. This choice of generally higher numbers is consistent with&#13;
Ness's argument about the incompleteness of most country reports, and also&#13;
allows us to use a single source for the majority of countries0&#13;
The figure for China of $1 per capita estimated by Prescett (using&#13;
Chen, 1982; Chen and Kols, 1982) and adopted here requires special commento&#13;
The amounts spent by all layers of government in China-central, provincial,&#13;
prefectural and county--for contraceptive supplies, provider training,&#13;
informational and motivational material, and service fees for sterilization,&#13;
abortion, and IUD insertion total $213 million annually (about $0.21 per&#13;
capita)0 On top of this, the rural collective system finances the family&#13;
planning staff at the commune or brigade level (at an estimated cost of $0.34&#13;
per capita) and pays incentives, in the form of food supplements and travel-&#13;
cost reimbursement, to holders of one-child certificates ($0o25 per capita)&#13;

and to individuals undergoing steril½zatiop ($0015 per capita). Pinally,&#13;
barefoot doctors spend a small amourt of addit_fonal time on fam&#143;.iLy plannilng&#13;
work; in Shandong Province they allocate ar average of 105 percent of their&#13;
time to family planning, valued at app:ox±mately $3 milliono Health workers&#13;
and midwives probably spend more time on family planning. All tnese&#13;
contributions total approximately $1 per capl'ta.&#13;
Estimating per capita spending&#13;
The sum of public expenditures in 1980, for those countries listed ln&#13;
Table 1, is $1,786 milliono This sum 4ncludes the five largest countries in&#13;
the developing world and eight of the ten largesto To obtain an, estimate for&#13;
the developing world as a whole, one night assUtic  that per capita spending in&#13;
the countries not covered is at roughly the 'evels shown in TabRe lo This&#13;
assumption is questionable, however, because tte sources consulted are much&#13;
less likely to have reported on countries that spend little or iAothirg on&#13;
population programs. The alternative assumption, that countries left out of&#13;
Table 1 spend nothing, moves too much to the other eytreme. hThat will be done&#13;
here instead is to estimate an equation for public spending an, use t0is to&#13;
predict spending in countries with nc other information0    This 4x much less&#13;
satisfactory than having even general repc-ts on expenditures, 'nd is&#13;
unacceptable if one needs information on specific countries; ho2,aver, the&#13;
interest here is mainly with regional aggregates0 For this pur.oose, this&#13;
procedure should be superior to the al.ternatives if a satisfact(ry equation is&#13;
estimated.&#13;
These variables were used to predict per capita public expendi-&#13;
tures: the inverse of population, per capita ONP, adult literacy, infant&#13;
mortality, population per physician, per capite lealth spending, the duration&#13;
of the population program, and family planni.mg prcgram effort scores&#13;
(expressed as percentages of maximum possible scores) as of 1972 and as of&#13;
19820  If population programs involve some fi2sd costs, regardless of program&#13;
size, the coefficient of the inverse of populatlon size should reflect these&#13;
costs0  GNP, literacy, and infant mout.1ity uerc '.ncluded on the assumption&#13;
that expenditures change with development level, probably risins, though the&#13;
reverse argument might also be made LhaZ poorrer countries must oBpend more to&#13;
provide absent infrastructure and to supplement more limited private funds.&#13;
An additional reason for using infant mortality, and the reason for using&#13;
health resources, is that health speading and its effects proba'ly covary with&#13;
spending on family planning0 Program duration and ratings of program effort,&#13;
finally, should be closely tied to program spending.&#13;
Measures of the first four variables as of 1980 were oatained from&#13;
World Bank files; population per physician is from World Bank (;980.79-82);&#13;
per capita national health budgets (at purchasing power parity, as of 1976)&#13;
from de Ferranti (1983); family planning program dates from NorLman (:982),&#13;
Watson (1982), or United Nations (1982); 1972 family planning scores from&#13;
Mauldin and Berelson (1978); and preliminary 1982 scores from lapham and&#13;
Mauldin (1984).&#13;
Table 2 reports the results of stepwlse regressions0    An R2 of 0067&#13;
was obtained using five variables. The signs for four of the hive predictors&#13;
were in the expected direction0   As predicted, the coefficient tor the inverse&#13;
of population was highly significant, indlcating an important f:ed-cost&#13;

Note:  Expenditures are in U.S. cents.    Standard errors are in parentheses.    The&#13;

four, and five variables. Other variables that did not enter into the regression&#13;
were adult literacy, population per physician, duration of population program, and&#13;
program effort in 1972. Equations 6 and 7 were estimated separately.&#13;

component. Program effort and health spending both relate posit:^vely to&#13;
population spending, whereas infant mortality relates negatively0 The&#13;
coefficient for GNP is negative but nevertheless significant, sLggesting that,&#13;
when the other factors are taken into account, lower levels of cevelopment&#13;
actually require higher spending.&#13;
This equation was used to assign expenditure estimates to countries&#13;
without data. (Countries under a million were assumed to have populations of&#13;
one million for purposes of calculatlng the inverseo)   For countries, mainly&#13;
smaller ones, that also lack data on these predictors, two additional&#13;
equations were estimated using fewer predictors (Table 2). A handful of the&#13;
smallest countries do not even have this much information, and 'n these cases&#13;
regional means (after values had been assigned for other countrles) were&#13;
used. Table 3 classifies countries by the source of the expend-ture&#13;
estimateso Those with actual data are about a third, but if only countries&#13;
larger than a million are considered, the proportion rises to almost a halfo&#13;
With the results from using the first equation, 85 percent of countries with&#13;
populations over a million are covered.&#13;
Regional means of these estimates are sho-n in Table 4, which also&#13;
provides means based solely on the original data in Table 10 Per capita,&#13;
public expenditures on population programs average $0 88 if only the original&#13;
data are used0 Weighting countries by population reduces the mean to $0.67;&#13;
smaller countries spend proportionally more, perhaps partly because of fixed&#13;
costs0  The estimating procedure produces a higher unweighted mean of $1oO6,&#13;
because more small countries are included, and a lower weighted mean of&#13;
$0o62o Expenditures vary by region0 In the orlginal data, weighted per&#13;
capita expenditures are highest in the Middle East and North Africa; the&#13;
estimation procedure reduces this figure considerably, but leaves the other&#13;
weighted regional averages essentially unchangedo In most comparisons, sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa and South Asia clearly spend much less per capita than other&#13;
regions on population programs0 Across the income groups used by the World&#13;
Bank (1983), per capita spending does not vary greatly0 The 34 low-income&#13;
economies spend $0o63 per capita; the the 39 lower middle-!ncome economies&#13;
$053 per capita; and the 21 upper middle-income economies $0.6O per capitao&#13;
These are weighted averages, and the slightly higher rate for lci--income&#13;
economies has partly to do with the contribution of China0&#13;
Estimated total public expenditures on population programs in the&#13;
developing world are $2.016 billiono   Since expenditures in China are&#13;
estimated at close to $1 billion, this figure is remarkably co-s4stent with&#13;
Speidel's estimate of $1 billion in the developing world outside China0   The&#13;
estimation process used here suggests that almost 90 percent ol all&#13;
expenditures are in the countries listed in Table 10   Only $23C mIllion is in&#13;
countries with no data0&#13;
Contraceptive prevalence and cost per user&#13;
It is instructive to relate costs to contraceptive usCs'Ts  Costs&#13;
might be related to new contraceptive acceptors within a given year or to all&#13;
current users; they might be related to acceptors or users whose source is the&#13;
government program, or to all acceptors or users regardless of source of&#13;
supply. The focus here will be on costs in relation to all curent users,&#13;
regardless of date of initial acceptance or supply source. This is the&#13;

easiest to calculate, because total contraceptive prevalence is &amp;'ten&#13;
available from reliable surveys0   Theoretically, this also appea7- to be the&#13;
appropriate ratio, for two reasons. First, public expenditures often&#13;
facilitate contraceptive use in the pcivate sector by legitimiz-iing its&#13;
practice and removing administrative and social obstacles. Thus it appears&#13;
reasonable to spread public spending over &amp;1l users, as long as pzivate&#13;
spending is also calculated. Second, the proper concern of ferttIity&#13;
reduction programs is not new acceptors alone but both new and continuing&#13;
users. Total prevalence is more directly relevant for fertility targets than&#13;
new acceptors or public-sector prevalence by themselves0&#13;
Contraceptive prevalence rates for 53 countries or terr:.tories for&#13;
various years are given in Appendix Table 20 To predict prevalence in&#13;
countries with no data, these rates were regressed on per capita ENP, adult&#13;
literacy, infant mortality, per capita health expenditures, popucation per&#13;
physician, and family planning program effort scores in 1972 and 1982o The&#13;
first three predictors are general development measures and the last four are&#13;
meant to reflect population program activities0 Program duration was&#13;
initially included as a predictor, but was deleted w^hen it entered with a&#13;
negative sign0 Although this may reflect a true relationship among countries&#13;
with data, using program duration in a predictive equation w^ould lead to&#13;
overestimates of prevalence in countrfes with very recent or no ?rograms0&#13;
With four variables in the equation, the stepwise resul'ts in Table 5&#13;
show an R2 of 00870 Program effort in 1972 has a positive effect on&#13;
prevalence, as do literacy and per capita GNP; population per physician has a&#13;
negative effect0 All these effects are in the expected directioca0 This&#13;
equation was used to predict prevalence. As i^rith costs, a second equation&#13;
using only 1972 program effort and infant mortality w^7as used as an alternative&#13;
for countries lacking datao (A few negative predicted values were changed to&#13;
zero)0  For the remaining countries, w^Jhich mostly have populations under one&#13;
million, prevalence was computed from the total fertility rate, applying mean&#13;
regional values in a procedure to be described further below0    Table 6 shows&#13;
the distributiork of countries by source of the prevalence estimateo   Half of&#13;
the countries over one million have actual prevalence data, and for most of&#13;
the remainder estimates were based on the four-variable equation.&#13;
Regional means for contraceptive prevalence appear in 'Lable 7.&#13;
Weighted means were obtained by summIng up contraceptive users across&#13;
countries and dividing by total number of married women of reproductive age,&#13;
assumed to be 15 percent of the po2ulation in each country0 Means using the&#13;
estimation procedure are close to those using the original data only0 Across&#13;
countries, prevalence averages 25 percent, but if proper weight is given to&#13;
China and other large countries, the averagge rises close to 40 percent0&#13;
Region by region, these prevalence estimates are close to, though slighly&#13;
below, those estimated by the United Nations Population Division (1984), using&#13;
a different methodology and slightly different basic data and regional&#13;
groupings.&#13;
These figures for prevalence were used in calculating costs per user&#13;
(Table 8)o With the original expenditure and prevalence data, costs per user&#13;
average $21 across countries0 Including estimated values raises the average&#13;
to $26, because more small countries with costs estimated to be relatively&#13;
high are included0 Weighted averages, obtained by summing costs across&#13;

Note:  s.d. stands for standard deviation and (n) for number of countries. For the&#13;
weighted columns, country costs are weighted by number of users. All current users&#13;
are in the denominator, regardless of source of supply. In calculating the last&#13;
four columns, a country was excluded if it had zero expenditures; its contraceptive&#13;
prevalence was 5 percent or less; or its contraceptive prevalence was not available&#13;
and could not be predicted (and the regional mean was therefore assigned)o&#13;

countries and dividing by total users, are often lower than unweighted&#13;
averages, especially when estimated values are included, because these small&#13;
countries are given less weight and the relative efficiency of large programs&#13;
like that of China receives more weight.&#13;
Whichever measure is used, regional public costs are lowest in East&#13;
and Southeast Asia, and on three out of four measures they are highest in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa.   The ranking among the other three regions depends on the&#13;
measure used. The spread across regions is wide; with the original data, cost&#13;
per user is $9 in East and Southeast Asia, $30 in sub-Saharan Africa. Adding&#13;
estimated values, the range is from $18 in East and Southeast Asia to $42 in&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa. Within regions, the variance is also large. Among the&#13;
five South Asian countries, the range is from $7 in Sri Lanka to $69 in&#13;
Nepal. Such intraregional variance suggests the inadequacy of relying on&#13;
regional averages and the need to consider each country separately.&#13;
Government and foreign donor expenditures&#13;
Among the countries with original data, the reported government&#13;
contribution to program expenditures averages 44 percent. The government&#13;
contribution is highest in East and Southeast Asia (72 percent), about equal&#13;
in South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa (46 and 45 percent), and&#13;
lower in Latin America and the Caribbean (38 percent) and sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
(27 percent). Governments often perceive their contributions to be&#13;
proportionally larger because, as pointed out by Ness and others (1984), they&#13;
often underestimate foreign contributions coming into the country through a&#13;
variety of channels. The proportion government contributes tends to rise with&#13;
program duration: the mean for four countries with programs less than five&#13;
years old is 8 percent, as opposed to 55 percent among nine countries with&#13;
programs at least 15 years old.&#13;
If expenditures are pooled across countries, the domestic contri-&#13;
bution appears much higher, at 83 percent, because the Chinese program is&#13;
entirely and Indian program largely locally financed.&#13;
Foreign donor contributions are regularly reported by UNFPA. Table 9&#13;
gives external assistance in this area between 1971 and 1981. The 1980 figure&#13;
is $476 million, or 24 percent of total estimated expenditures of $2,016&#13;
million. For this figure to be consistent with the estimates here, it must be&#13;
assumed--not unreasonably--that donor contributions are proportionally much&#13;
greater (73 percent of expenditures) in countries with no expenditure data in&#13;
Table 1. Then donor expenditures would be divided into $309 million in the&#13;
countries listed in Table 1 and $167 million in all other countries, and&#13;
government expenditures into $1,477 million in the countries in Table I and&#13;
only $63 million elsewhere.&#13;
Table 9 also suggests that external assistance was rising at a&#13;
respectable rate (in constant dollars) up to around 1979. The two succeeding&#13;
years showed drops in external assistance; UNFPA projections of their own&#13;
assistance for 1984-87 indicate growth of no more than 1 percent a year. Per&#13;
person in the developing countries, donor expenditures also grew in the&#13;
earlier period, but more modestly, and the decline in 1980 and 1981 was&#13;
sharper.&#13;

Current Private Expenditures&#13;
Private expenditures on family planning are much more difficult to&#13;
determine. The only previous estimate in the literature appears to be&#13;
"roughly $100 million" (Lewison, 1983), based on a personal communication and&#13;
otherwise undocumented, and very possibly well off the mark. The basic&#13;
approach that will be taken here is to compute expenditures from method-&#13;
specific contraceptive costs and method prevalence among users who rely on&#13;
nonprogram sources. Such data are relatively rare, and values will have to be&#13;
assigned, this time, to a larger number of countries. Only commodity and&#13;
service costs, and not travel or time costs, will be covered.&#13;
Data on method costs and nonprogram prevalence&#13;
Schearer (1983) has recently reported private-sector costs for&#13;
contraceptive methods in 21 countries. These were obtained in 1980-81 with&#13;
the voluntary assistance of 29 professional staff members of the Population&#13;
Council, UNFPA, the Ford Foundation, and USAID stationed in different&#13;
countries, who were requested to obtain data from local pharmacies,&#13;
physicians, and family planning service outlets.&#13;
Table 10 provides these data. Schearer notes that the costs for&#13;
pills and injectables are supply costs only; in both cases, prescription fees&#13;
and examination costs are not included. The costs for IUDs do include&#13;
insertion, however, and the sterilization figures cover all costs.    Schearer&#13;
does not give costs for vaginal methods; these were assumed to equal the&#13;
average of the cost of spermicides and diaphragms. The latter was computed&#13;
from Schearer's data as the sum of the cost of an initial fitting, one follow-&#13;
up visit, and 18 months of spermicide use, divided by expected two-years'&#13;
continuation. Nonsupply methods--rhythm, withdrawal, abstinence, and&#13;
traditional methods--are assumed here to be costless.&#13;
Regional averages are also given in Table 10. Method costs generally&#13;
are much higher in sub-Saharan Africa, lower than average in Asia. The&#13;
variation appears to be greater across regions than within regions across&#13;
methods.&#13;
Data on nonprogram contraceptive prevalence by method (Table 11) were&#13;
obtained from country reports on recent Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys and&#13;
from Nortman (1982). Specific methods are not always clearly distinguished.&#13;
Vaginal method figures in Table 11 include diaphragms, spermicides, and&#13;
douches, and nonsupply method figures include rhythm, withdrawal, abstinence,&#13;
and traditional methods. In some cases, the "other" category has been&#13;
arbitrarily divided between vaginal and nonsupply methods, and the&#13;
sterilization category between female and male sterilization, giving much more&#13;
weight to female sterilization. The program-nonprogram distinction is often&#13;
difficult to make where both sectors are important. In the few cases where&#13;
they were distinguished in these reports, users who relied on private but&#13;
government-subsidized programs were considered to be program users.&#13;
Eight of the countries with nonprogram prevalence data also have&#13;
method cost data. For the remaining countries, mean regional method costs can&#13;
be applied instead. The resulting estimates of private expenditures per&#13;

capita and per user are in Table 120   Among the eight countries ulth both cost&#13;
and prevalence data, per capita private spending ranges from $008 to $0O76o&#13;
The range is wider among the countries for which regional method costs were&#13;
used, the maximum being $1.45. Given the failure to include initiai medical&#13;
fees for two methods, these estimates are likely to be slightly ;ielow actual&#13;
costs. Overall, private spending is less than public spending, not reaching&#13;
60 percent of the latter in two-thirds of the countries. However, private&#13;
spending is greater than public spending in a few places: Colombia, the&#13;
Dominican Republic, Peru, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, China.&#13;
Of the per user figures in Table 12, the most useful is the most&#13;
specific. the annual cost per private or nonprogram user of supply methods&#13;
only. Among the countries with both cost and prevalence data, the range is&#13;
from $8 in Egypt to $29 in the Dominican Republic; Mauritius is _lsted even&#13;
higher, at $50, because of the high method costs in the sub-Saharan countries&#13;
with data.&#13;
Estimating private spending&#13;
Obtaining an estimate of total private spending requires generalizing&#13;
from these limited data. The number of nonprogram users of supply methods in&#13;
each country was estimated, and average costs per nonprogram supply user&#13;
applied .&#13;
Estimating users involved three steps. First, prevalence of&#13;
nonsupply methods was determined from survey reports; data were available for&#13;
47 countries (see Table 18 below)0 For the other countries, regional means&#13;
for the percentage of users on nonsupply methods were multiplied by the&#13;
previously determined estimates of total contraceptive prevalenceo Second,&#13;
the proportion of nonprogram users among those on supply methods only was&#13;
determined for the 20 countries with nonprogram method prevalence data (see&#13;
Appendix Table 2), and regional means for this proportion applied elsewhere.&#13;
(China was assumed to have no nonprogram prevalence; since the single country&#13;
for sub-Saharan Africa showed an unusually low value of .073, the overall mean&#13;
of o380 was used instead for this region0) Third, the number of nonprogram&#13;
supply users was calculated from these proportions, the estimated prevalence&#13;
rate, and the number of married women of reproductive age, assumed to be 15&#13;
percent of the population0&#13;
The cost for each of these nonprogram supply users was derived from&#13;
Table 12; for countries not listed, regional averages from this table were&#13;
used0 These regional averages are generally reasonable. The fI°gure for sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, which is rather high, depends only on Mauritius, an atypical&#13;
country, but its cost estimate is based on high reported costs In four other,&#13;
larger countries: Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, and Zaire0 Table 13 summarizes&#13;
the procedure by providing the regional means for each key variable0&#13;
An alternative estimate of cost per nonprogram supply user wyas&#13;
obtained by assuming that cost is simply a function of number of nonprogram&#13;
supply users0 Regressing cost (in dollars) on users (in 100,000's) for the&#13;
countries in Table 12 gave the equation:&#13;

(3.06) (1.27)        (.0849)&#13;
with both terms significant and R2 being 037 (standard errors ln&#13;
parenthesis)0 Costs decline as nonprogram users increase, this equation&#13;
indicates, until minimum cost is reached at close to one million -asers.&#13;
Beyond that point, costs rise againo This equation was used to assign an&#13;
alternative figure for cost per nonprogram supply user to each co-antry0 To&#13;
prevent the cost estimates from rising too high in large countries, costs were&#13;
assumed to be constant beyond 107 million users (about the maximum for the&#13;
data on which the equation was estimated), at which point costs equal the mean&#13;
across all countries with data.&#13;
A second alternative estimate was based on the assumption that cost&#13;
per nonprogram supply user equals cost per program usero The latter was&#13;
calculated country by country using previously estimated public expenditures&#13;
and program prevalence (obtained as a residual from estimated total&#13;
prevalence, excluding nonsupply and nonprogram users)0 Where prevalence was&#13;
under 5 percent or public expenditures were zero, a country was assigned the&#13;
regional (unweighted) mean0 Regional averages (also in Table 13) are&#13;
considerably different depending on whether they are weighted or not0 The&#13;
unweighted numbers are well above costs per nonprogram supply user: the mean&#13;
across all countries is $83o98 per program user, as compared to a figure of&#13;
$21.73 per nonprogram supply user0 Weighted figures, on the other hand, are&#13;
slightly below, though generally close to, costs per nonprogram supply user;&#13;
the overall weighted mean is $16.10 Only for the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa do program and nonprogram costs diverge greatly after weighting: the&#13;
cost per program user in this region is three times the cost per nonprogram&#13;
supply user0&#13;
Table 14 reports the resulting estimates of total priva:e&#13;
expenditures, region by region0 The base estimates indicate total private&#13;
spending of $548 million, slightly less than half from Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean, where nonprogram supply prevalence is estimated to be at least&#13;
three times that for any other region0 Making costs per user de?endent on&#13;
number of users reduces the estimated total to $490 million, mainly because of&#13;
reductions for Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa0 Assuming instead that&#13;
private costs equal program costs raises the estimated total to $663 million,&#13;
mainly because of increases for Latin America and Africa0&#13;
Which are the best estimates? Since the first set is thte most&#13;
directly data-based, and is bracketed by the latter two, it might be&#13;
considered a set of medium estimates0 However, as earlier noted, it includes&#13;
underestimates for two methods, and a slightly higher figure might be&#13;
preferable0 These estimates also appear less reliable than the public&#13;
expenditure estimates, not only because of the limited cost data but also&#13;
because nonprogram prevalence is measured more poorly than total prevalence.&#13;
The base estimates imply that private expenditures are 21 percent of&#13;
all expenditures (public plus private) in developing countries. The&#13;
percentage of nonprogram users, out of all users of supply methcds, is higher&#13;
(38 percent), sugggesting that private users are more numerous e^ilere private&#13;
costs are below program costso The proportion of total expenditures taken up&#13;

by private spending varies considerably across regions. It is 8 percent in&#13;
East Asia; 15 in the Middle East; 25 in South Asia; 38 in sub-Saharan Africa;&#13;
and 53 in Latin America. In comparison to health spending, population&#13;
spending involves a smaller private component. Private expenditures average&#13;
50 percent of all health expenditures across 19 developing countries (de&#13;
Ferranti, 1983:20), though this proportion also varies widely, from around 10&#13;
to around 90 percent.&#13;
Future Contraceptive Users&#13;
Resource requirements for the future depend on future fertility and&#13;
related contraceptive prevalence levels. These levels will be set in three&#13;
ways. First, one immediate target will be defined as filling all unmet need&#13;
for contraception, defined as the proportion of exposed married women of&#13;
reproductive age not using contraception despite a desire to terminate&#13;
childbearing.&#13;
Second, fertility targets up to 2000 will be defined as simply&#13;
meeting the World Bank standard projections. These projections are based on&#13;
judgments about the most likely future paths of fertility, mortality, and&#13;
migration in each country. Total fertility is projected by first selecting a&#13;
future year, between 2000 and 2050, for the attainment of replacement&#13;
fertility. Then curves are fitted for the course of total fertility up to the&#13;
replacement year, the curves being chosen to provide slower decline in the&#13;
earlier period (in some cases after a few years of constant fertility), more&#13;
rapid decline thereafter, and constant fertility after reaching replacement.&#13;
A similar process is involved for the mortality and migration assumptions.&#13;
Projections are available country by country (Vu, 1983).&#13;
Third, targets to 2000 will be defined by the rapid fertility decline&#13;
pattern described by Bulatao and Elwan (1984). This pattern involves a linear&#13;
decline in total fertility of 0.216 points a year till replacement is&#13;
reached. The pattern corresponds to the average experience of 11 developing&#13;
countries with rapid decline in the postwar period.&#13;
Estimating unmet need&#13;
Boulier (1984) provides estimates of the unmet need for contraception&#13;
for limiting births in 35 countries, based on World Fertility Survey and&#13;
Contraceptive Prevalence Survey data. The estimates range from 1 percent in&#13;
Cameroon to 25 percent in Bangladesh (see Appendix Table 2).&#13;
Stepwise regressions were run to predict unmet need from these&#13;
variables: per capita GNP, adult literacy, infant mortality, per capita&#13;
health spending, population per physician, duration of population program,&#13;
1972 and 1982 family planning effort scores, contraceptive prevalence, and&#13;
contraceptive prevalence squared (Table 15). Contrary to expectation,&#13;
contraceptive prevalence had neither a linear nor a quadratic relationship to&#13;
unmet need. Program effort in 1982 was positively related to unmet need, more&#13;
likely as a consequence than a cause. Adult literacy contributed to lower&#13;
unmet need, health spending to higher need.&#13;

The three-variable equation (R2 = 0.38) was used to assign unmet need&#13;
values to 43 additional countries, almost all of them larger than one&#13;
million. Regional means were assigned in the remaining 66 cases, almost&#13;
three-fourths of them small countries under one million. Regional levels of&#13;
unmet need are essentially unaffected by adding these assigned values, except&#13;
that sub-Saharan levels are slightly raised (Table 16). Across all countries,&#13;
unmet need is 11 percent whether or not predicted values are incorporated, or&#13;
14 percent with weighting. Unmet need is fairly equal across regions, except&#13;
for South Asia, where it is 50 to 100 percent higher than elsewhere.&#13;
Deriving prevalence from total fertility&#13;
Future contraceptive prevalence levels could be derived from the&#13;
predicted total fertility rates, under standard and rapid fertility decline,&#13;
using an appropriately estimated regression equation or set of equations.&#13;
This procedure would, however, force any countries that are currently&#13;
outliers, as far as the fertility-prevalence relationship is concerned, toward&#13;
the mean. In effect, women in countries with unusually long or unusually&#13;
short breastfeeding durations would be assumed to breastfeed shorter or&#13;
longer, or women in countries with relatively early or relatively late&#13;
marriage to marry in the future at developing-world average ages.&#13;
The procedure used here instead allows the incorporation of&#13;
information about the current relationship in each country between prevalence&#13;
and fertility, as well as information about contraceptive use-effectiveness.&#13;
Bongaarts (1978) has shown that the total fertility rate (TFR) can be&#13;
represented as the product of the total fecundity level (TF) and separate&#13;
factors representing the effects of marriage (Cm), contraception (Cc), induced&#13;
abortion (Ca), and postpartum infecundability (Ci):&#13;
TFR = Cm Cc Ca Ci TF.&#13;
The contraception index, in turn, depends on contraceptive prevalence or use&#13;
(u) and average use-effectiveness (e):&#13;
Cc = 1 - 1.08 u e,&#13;
where 1.08 is a correction for sterile contraceptors.&#13;
A new total fertility rate can be defined to represent what fertility&#13;
would be if no contraception were practiced. This will be called the total&#13;
unplanned fertility rate (or TUFR, where "unplanned" refers to the absence of&#13;
any family planning; it might be called the total natural fertility rate&#13;
instead, except that it includes abortion effects). This rate should&#13;
represent the level of fertility in each country produced solely by the total&#13;
fecundity level and the combination of marriage, breastfeeding, and abortion&#13;
practices. It can be calculated from current total fertility and current&#13;
prevalence using the equation&#13;
TUFR = TFR / (1 - 1.08 u e)&#13;
as long as use-effectiveness can be determined. If it is then assumed that&#13;
the TUFR stays constant in each country over time--in other words that&#13;
marriage, breastfeeding, abortion, and fecundity do not change, or that any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24 -&#13;
changes in them are exactly offsetting in their fertility effects--future&#13;
prevalence can be calculated directly from future total fertility, given some&#13;
assumption about future use-effectiveness.&#13;
How reasonable is the assumption of a constant TUFR over a 20'year&#13;
period? Bongaarts (1982) has argued that the fertility effects of marriage&#13;
and breastfeeding over the fertility transition are largely offsetting. He&#13;
shows the effect of induced abortion to be relatively small overa.10 He makes&#13;
no generalizations about fecundity; it could rise substantially in those&#13;
countries, mainly sub-Saharan, where infertllity is common, but h's sample of&#13;
31 countries includes only one sub-Saharan country, and none with a serious&#13;
infertility problem0&#13;
Bongaarts provides a quantitative summary of the behavior of the&#13;
proximate determinants in fertility transition, obtained by averaging across&#13;
countries at different fertility levels0 MTr.en TUFRs are calculated from his&#13;
data, the pattern across the four phases of the transition is this:&#13;
Phase     TFR       TUFR       Prevalence&#13;
I         7.03      7.71       10&#13;
II        5.03      7038       35&#13;
III       3o88      6.16      40&#13;
IV        2.06      6o84       69&#13;
In the course of the transition, later marriage and less breastfeeding&#13;
initially produce falling TUFRs, followed eventually by a slight rebound.&#13;
Prevalence and TUFRs appear to move together, with TUFRs falling as prevalence&#13;
rises and then rising again0 An attempt was made to estimate this&#13;
relationship using Bongaarts' initial data. it was unsuccessful; with linear,&#13;
quadratic, and cubic terms for prevalence as predictors, barely 10 percent of&#13;
the variance in TUFRs was explained. Similar regressions were run using&#13;
alternative data, from World Fertility Surveys on developing countries,&#13;
provided by Casterline and others (1983). Even less of the variance was&#13;
explained, and using the Cc index as a predictor instead produced still weaker&#13;
results0 TUFRs may be so culturally specific, and subject to such diverse&#13;
influences, that such simple analysis is not adequate0&#13;
Because there appears to be no convincing way to project TUFRs,&#13;
constant TUFRs will be assumed for the base projection0 This also avoids&#13;
another complication: changes in the factors involved in TUFRs are probably&#13;
not costless, but no way exists at present to assign some cost to them0&#13;
To provide an alternative, changing TUFRs will be assigned to&#13;
countries in a rough fashion, using the summary table above0   These&#13;
assumptions were made: (a) the figures in the summary table are taken to&#13;
represent the midpoint of each phase, wi-th prevalence and TUFR changing&#13;
linearly between midpoints; (b) the time required to move from tne midpoint of&#13;
each phase to the following midpoint is 15 years under the standsrd&#13;
projection, seven years under the rapid decline projection; and (c) prevalence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
prior to Phase I is zero, and TUFR prior to Phase I is constant at the Phase I&#13;
value, and after Phase IV constant at the Phase IV value. Then, from each&#13;
country's current prevalence, its position in relation to these four phases&#13;
was determined, and the expected TUFR at that point calculated. It was&#13;
assumed that, whatever a country's current TUFR, within ten years its TUFR&#13;
would equal that defined by this pattern, and would change in accordance with&#13;
the pattern thereafter. This process effectively assigned a uniform&#13;
progression of TUFRs to each country, with each starting at a slightly&#13;
different point in the progression. This progression represents Bongaarts'&#13;
conception of the changes in proximate determinants in the fertility&#13;
transition, but not too much confidence should be placed in it because of the&#13;
weakness of the relationship between prevalence and TUFRs.&#13;
The procedure outlined for deriving prevalence from total fertility&#13;
is essentially that recommended by Bongaarts (1983), who does not, however,&#13;
explicitly calculate TUFRs. Focusing on them here is useful in encouraging&#13;
speculation about likely trends in noncontraceptive factors affecting&#13;
fertility and their potential impact.&#13;
Estimating use-effectiveness and TUFRs&#13;
Computing TUFRs requires data on contraceptive use-effectiveness.&#13;
Current levels can be estimated given some assumptions, but insufficient&#13;
information exists for making firm judgments about future trends. One might&#13;
expect improvements in use-effectiveness, but again these would very likely&#13;
involve some unknown increase in unit costs, for more research into improved&#13;
contraceptives, greater method availability, better user education, or some&#13;
similar factor. In all the projections, constant use-effectiveness will be&#13;
assumed, but alternative use-effectiveness levels will be introduced.&#13;
Extrapolating from a Philippine study by Laing (1978), Bongaarts&#13;
(1982) assigns these use-effectiveness rates to different methods:&#13;
sterilization, 1.00; the pill, 0.90; the IUD, 0.95; and other methods, 0.70.&#13;
These rates are used here, with the figure of 0.70 for other methods applied&#13;
similarly to condoms, vaginal methods, and nonsupply methods. Injectables&#13;
were arbitrarily assigned a rate of 0.88.&#13;
A higher set of rates was derived through a roundabout method.&#13;
Goldman and others (1983) have recently calculated contraceptive failure rates&#13;
from World Fertility Survey data for five Latin American countries. Their&#13;
rates include failures after discontinuation; it is argued that frequent&#13;
discontinuation is itself a drawback of a method, and subsequent pregnancies&#13;
should also be attributed to it. From their cumulative one-year failure rates&#13;
per method, "extended" use-effectiveness was calculated using a formula&#13;
provided by Bongaarts and Potter (1983:75) and assuming natural fecundability&#13;
to be 0.14. These rates were: the pill, 0.95; injectables, 0.92; the IUD,&#13;
0.97; condoms, 0.92; other female scientific methods, 0.90; douches and&#13;
unclassified methods, 0.90; abstinence, 0.94; withdrawal, 0.89; and rhythm,&#13;
0.88. Despite including discontinuation, the rates for modern methods are&#13;
slightly above those used by Bongaarts, and the rates for other methods&#13;
considerably higher, essentially comparable to use-effectiveness rates in the&#13;
U.S. Goldman and others note that the failure rates they obtained could have&#13;
been suppressed by undetermined periods of postpartum amennorhea, and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
failure rates for ineffective methods were probably further suppressed by&#13;
unreported method switching.&#13;
Whatever the proper explanation, it Wll be assumed fer this exercise&#13;
that these extended use-effectiveness rates set an upper limit on actual use-&#13;
effectiveness in developing countries. Alternative projections will be&#13;
reported using these rates (to be referred to as "high0 use-effectiveness, to&#13;
contrast with the "normal" use-effectiveness rates based on Bongaarts)0 These&#13;
rates were supplemented with a sterilization figure of i°OO; vzg±nal methods&#13;
were assigned a rate of 0.90 and nonsupply methods a rate of OC880&#13;
Table 17 provides method distribution data for 47 countries and mean&#13;
use-effectiveness rates. Use-effectiveness ranges from 073 tc Oo96 across&#13;
countries, with a mean of Oo85; "high"' use-effectiveness ranges from 089 to&#13;
00999 with a mean of Oo94o Regional averages are reported in Table 19 (and&#13;
were applied to the other countries without data)0 Average use-effectiveness&#13;
is similar in Latin America, East Asia, and South Asia, lower in the Middle&#13;
East, and lowest in sub-Saharan Afrlcao   These averages are lower than&#13;
regional averages estimated by Bongearts (1984), because the Urnited Nations&#13;
(1984) method distribution data he relies on assume greater use of&#13;
sterilization and IUDs and less use of nonsupply methods in most regions0&#13;
However, Bongaarts' (1984) averages fall below the averages fox' high use-&#13;
effectiveness0&#13;
TUFRs were calculated given the use-effectiveness rates, and Table 18&#13;
also reports regional means0 (The regional mean based on norme.1 use-&#13;
effectiveness rates were assigned to countries for which prevalence was not&#13;
available and could not be predicted, and prevalence calculated from them and&#13;
from country-specific total fertility rates0) High use-effectiveness rates&#13;
translate into higher TUFRs, averaging 7.7 as opposed to 7.3 from the normal&#13;
rates0 The lowest TUFRs appear for South Asia (6o5 to 6.7); the highest,&#13;
using normal use-effectiveness rates, appear for the Middle East (7.5), but&#13;
using high use-effectiveness rates East Asia is higher (8o2). Foor comparison,&#13;
TUFRs were calculated from Casterline and others' (1983) cross--national&#13;
analysis of World Fertility Survey data on proximate determinants. The same&#13;
pattern across regions appears in the TUFRs calculated here as ,7.n&#13;
Casterline's, the only discrepancy being the ranking of East Asia based on&#13;
high use-effectiveness0 However, TUFRs calculated here appear slightly lower&#13;
overall, and are less extreme, possibly because of the use of some regional&#13;
averages in their calculation0&#13;
Projecting contraceptive users&#13;
Table 19 gives population projections and parallel projections of&#13;
contraceptive users following the methodology just outlinedo Under the&#13;
assumptions adopted here, filling all unmet need would mean 64 million more&#13;
contraceptive users throughout the developing world, an increase of 33&#13;
percento The increase would be proportionally greatest in sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
and South Asia, where users would double or almost double0 For every region,&#13;
filling unmet need in 1980 would lead to almost as many, If not clearly more,&#13;
users than there would be by 1985 under standard fertility decline0   For sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, the number of users if unmet need were filled would not in&#13;

fact be attained until after 1990 under standard decline. Filling unmet need&#13;
is, therefore, a fairly ambitious target for this region0 On the other hand,&#13;
in every region, the number of users with unmet need filled is less than that&#13;
for 1985 given rapid fertility decline. The implication is that filling unmet&#13;
need is consistent with rapid decline, and that, for rapid decl,ne to be&#13;
maintained, generating more contraceptive demand will be essentlal.&#13;
Under the standard projection, the table shows developing-country&#13;
population rising 50 percent, from 3.3 to 4.9 billion, between 1980 and 2000;&#13;
under the rapid decline projection, the rise is to 4o5 billion. GrowTth is&#13;
most rapid in sub-Saharan Africa; population almost doubles in this period&#13;
under the standard projection. (Population is actually margina;ly greater in&#13;
some periods in East and Southeast Asia in the rapid decline than in the&#13;
standard projection because below-replacement fertility is not allowed under&#13;
rapid decline.)&#13;
For standard decline to be realized, contraceptive users by 2000 in&#13;
the developing world as a whole must be 2.2 times as numerous as in 1980. In&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa, they must be 4.5 times as numerous by 2000 Rapid&#13;
fertility decline, on the other hand, will imply 2.6 times as many&#13;
contraceptive users in 2000 as in 1980 in the developing world, but 1 06 times&#13;
as many in 2000 as in 1980 in sub-Saharan Africao&#13;
Some comparisons can be made between the standard decline projections&#13;
and projections by Bongaarts (1984)D which depend on the same m2thodology for&#13;
deriving prevalence from fertility targets. Several differences between that&#13;
exercise and this are important: (a) Bongaarts' basic data are different--he&#13;
relies on United Nations (1984) for current prevalence and on the United&#13;
Nations medium projection for population and future fertility rates; (b) he&#13;
groups countries differently, treating all of Africa as one region and&#13;
including Southeast Asia in South Asia, whlch as a consequence is 50 percent&#13;
larger; (c) he calculates users region by region, rather than aggregating&#13;
country projections; and (d) his projections start in 1984 rather than in 1980&#13;
(and go on to 2025). For the year 2000, he estimates contraceptive users in&#13;
the developing world at 462 million, slightly above the 425 mil.l.ion given in&#13;
the standard projectiono He reaches this number with a slightly higher&#13;
initial number of users (256 million in 1984, as opposed to 243 million in&#13;
1985 in the standard projection) and slightly slower growth in usage (3.8&#13;
percent annually between 1984 and 2000, as opposed to 401 percent annually&#13;
between 1980 and 2000 in the standard projection)o Region by region&#13;
comparisons of numbers of users are complicated by the difference in&#13;
groupings; growth rates are easier to compare. The standard pTojection and&#13;
Bongaarts both agree in assigning fastest growth in contraceptive use to&#13;
Africa (7.8 percent annually in the standard projection, 7.3 according to&#13;
Bongaarts) and slowest growth to East Asia (2.4 percent annual growth and 2.0&#13;
percent annual growth, respectively)o Gro-wth rates in contraceptive use for&#13;
Latin America diverge slightly more (4.5 percent in the standard projection,&#13;
3.7 percent for Bongaarts), and for South Asia still more (7.0 versus 5.4&#13;
percent), because of the differences in regional definitiono Overall,&#13;
however, taking the contrasts in methodology and the great amount of&#13;
uncertainty in such projections into account, these differences do not seem&#13;
excessive.&#13;

Future Resource Requirements&#13;
Assessing changes in public costs&#13;
It was observed earlier that private costs per user bear some&#13;
relationship to the number of nonprogram supply users. Whether some similar&#13;
relationship exists for public sector costs, and whether they can be expected&#13;
to rise or fall in the future, is an essential question to ask. This cannot&#13;
be decided a priori. Because of scale economies, because higher levels of&#13;
socioeconomic development and increasing numbers of satisfied users might&#13;
generate rising interest in family planning, and because previous acceptors&#13;
may need less follow-up and an increasing number may choose permanent methods&#13;
like sterilization, public costs per user could fall as a program develops.&#13;
On the other h3nd, expanding a family planning program may require reaching&#13;
progressively more isolated areas and using increasingly expensive appeals;&#13;
personnel and other costs may rise with development; or clients may demand&#13;
services of better quality. Each of these circumstances would imply rising&#13;
rather than falling user costs.&#13;
To test the relationship between user costs and number of users, the&#13;
former was regressed on the latter across countries (leaving out countries for&#13;
which these values were estimated). Regressions were also run for public&#13;
costs per public user and number of public users, for the smaller set of&#13;
countries for which public and private users were reliably distinguished.&#13;
With linear and quadratic terms in the equation, R2 was only 0.09 in the first&#13;
case, 0.07 in the second, and the coefficients were not significant. No trend&#13;
in user costs is indicated.&#13;
For trends in user cost within countries, Gillespie and others (1981)&#13;
summarize the results of a number of studies. They show costs per couple year&#13;
of protection or costs per birth averted falling over time in six studies; in&#13;
six other studies, however, costs rise, stay constant, or show contradictory&#13;
trends.&#13;
This issue can be further investigated with Ness's data on Asian&#13;
countries, which include not only 1980 expenditures but also estimates for&#13;
previous years. Program prevalence is also given, year by year, mainly from&#13;
service statistics, though total prevalence is available only for a few years&#13;
(Ness and others, 1983). User costs dropped sharply, in a number of cases, in&#13;
the first few years of the family planning program. Between 1969 and 1970 in&#13;
Indonesia, for instance, Ness's data indicate that the cost per program user&#13;
fell from $166 to $34 (in 1980 dollars). The trend after the initial period&#13;
is less clear across countries, with some showing rising, some falling, and&#13;
some fluctuating user costs, though changes are always small relative to&#13;
changes during the early program years.&#13;
As a rough means of determining any trend, cost per program user was&#13;
regressed on number of program users and the square of number of program users&#13;
for each country separately. To prevent initial changes from swamping the&#13;
results, observations were left out if a population policy had been in effect&#13;
less than three years or if estimated total prevalence was under 3 percent.&#13;
Table 20 reports the results for a dozen countries. Great variability is&#13;
evident, and in the majority of cases the coefficients are not statistically&#13;

significant. For four countries, however, significant results were&#13;
obtained. The equations for Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Taiwan each&#13;
indicate falling costs per program user up to a point varying between half a&#13;
million to three million users, and rising costs thereafter. In three of&#13;
these cases, the number of users had passed the minimum-cost point by 1980,&#13;
and costs were therefore rising.&#13;
Another approach to this issue is to ask whether the effect of&#13;
expenditures on contraceptive prevalence rises or falls with level of&#13;
socioeconomic development. Some such trend in the effect of expenditures&#13;
might allow one to anticipate changes in future costs. To detertrne any&#13;
trend, regressions were run using the pooled time-series data for the Asian&#13;
countries. In alternative specifications, either program or estimated total&#13;
prevalence was the dependent variable, all variables were represented by&#13;
levels or by three-year changes, and alternative measures of development were&#13;
used. The results were uneven. In a few specifications, interactions between&#13;
expenditures arid development indicators were significant, but in others they&#13;
were not. The significant interactions, in addition, worked in opposite&#13;
directions: expenditure increases were related to larger increases in program&#13;
prevalence when literacy was rising more rapidly, but to smaller increases&#13;
when infant mortality was falling more rapidly.&#13;
Although there are hints in these different analyses that user costs&#13;
are occasionally dependent on number of users or on development, no consistent&#13;
pattern of relationships emerges.&#13;
Projecting public expenditures&#13;
In the absence of a clear alternative, future public costs per user&#13;
will be assumed to stay at their current levels in each country. However,&#13;
user costs in those countries with current prevalence of 5 percent or less may&#13;
be assumed to be too high, and regional mean public costs per user will be&#13;
applied instead in these cases. Countries with no current expenditures were&#13;
also assigned these regional means.&#13;
The assumptions underlying the base expenditure projections may&#13;
therefore be summarized: (1) costs per user stay constant at current country&#13;
by country levels; (2) average use-effectiveness, as defined by Bongaarts'&#13;
rates, also stays constant; (3) TUFRs stay constant, because of some&#13;
combination of unchanging underlying factors (marriage, breastfeeding,&#13;
abortion, and fecundity) and the fertility effects of changes in these factors&#13;
cancelling out; (4) married women of reproductive age are a constant 15&#13;
percent of the population; and (5) prevalence targets are defined by unmet&#13;
need, and alternatively fertility targets are defined by standard and rapid&#13;
decline projections.&#13;
The results of the base expenditure projection are in Table 21.&#13;
Public expenditures will have to rise 50 percent to satisfy current unmet need&#13;
for contraception. The proportional increase required is much larger in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa and South Asia than elsewhere. The absolute increase required,&#13;
on the other hand, is largest in South Asia and East Asia. The assumption of&#13;
constant cost per user is very likely inaccurate in relation to unmet need,&#13;
since these women are probably harder to motivate or supply than current&#13;
users. No information exists, however, on how much more expensive this should&#13;

Note: All means are weighted by population as of the given date, The 1980 figures under&#13;
"standard decline" are the previously calculated estimates of actual fertility rates and&#13;
expenditures. The 1980 figures under "rapid decline" are rates and expenditures required&#13;
to fill all "unmet need" for contraception. Country by country population projections&#13;
were used for the standard fertility decline scenario, For rapid fertility decline,&#13;
country by country total fertility rate projections were also generated, but the future&#13;
population numbers were derived by applying implied growth rates from regional projections&#13;
to each country.&#13;

be. Where unmet need is concerned these estimates should probably be regarded&#13;
as a lower limit.&#13;
For standard fertility decline, expenditures should be $5.6 billion&#13;
(in 1980 dollars) by 2000; for rapid decline, expenditures should be $7.6&#13;
billion. Expenditures will have to grow an average of 5 percent a year to&#13;
meet the first target, 7 percent a year to meet the second (Table 22). More&#13;
rapid expenditure growth will be necessary in sub-Saharan Africa: 10 percent&#13;
growth is necessary to reach the standard 2000 target, 16 percent for the&#13;
rapid decline target. Expenditures will also have to grow fairly rapidly in&#13;
the Middle East and South Asia, and even for Latin America 5 percent growth&#13;
will be needed. These are average growth rates; more rapid expenditure growth&#13;
will actually be needed during the 1980s than during the 1990s. The exception&#13;
to this statement is the standard projection for sub-Saharan Africa, because&#13;
this projection assumes that fertility decline in this region will be&#13;
relatively tardy.&#13;
Another way to look at the numbers is to note the share of each&#13;
region in developing-country expenditures. For 1980, 61 percent of public&#13;
expenditures are in East and Southeast Asia. If each region experiences&#13;
standard fertility decline, this share will be only 36 percent by 2000.&#13;
Shares will roughly double in sub-Saharan Africa (6 to 14 percent), the Middle&#13;
East and North Africa (7 to 13 percent), and South Asia (16 to 27 percent),&#13;
and drop marginally in Latin America and the Caribbean (10 to 9 percent).&#13;
The largest increase in expenditures between 1980 and 2000 will have&#13;
to be in the countries that are currently low-income (by the World Bank's&#13;
definition). Expenditures would have to increase by $1.9 billion in these 34&#13;
countries, in the standard projection. In currently lower middle-income&#13;
countries, the required increase would be about $1.0 billion, and in currently&#13;
upper middle-income countries $.5 billion. For rapid fertility decline, the&#13;
increases will have to be roughly 50 percent greater in low-income and lower&#13;
middle-income countries, but only slightly greater in upper middle-income&#13;
countries. Proportionally, however, expenditures will have to grow fastest in&#13;
lower middle-income countries, which currently spend slightly less than the&#13;
other groups per capita.&#13;
Alternative projections to this basic set using high use-&#13;
effectiveness rates are given in Table 23. These projections do not imply&#13;
rising use-effectiveness; rather, they assume high use-effectiveness both at&#13;
present and in the future. Slightly lower prevalence is required in these&#13;
projections: instead of 58 percent across all countries by 2000 for standard&#13;
decline, 55 percent will be required. Instead of 72 percent for rapid decline&#13;
by 2000, 67 percent will be required. Expenditure requirements are&#13;
correspondingly lower, by about 5 percent under standard decline and about 8&#13;
percent under rapid decline.&#13;
A second set of alternative projections using a progression of TUFRs,&#13;
calculated following the procedure outlined above, is provided in Table 24.&#13;
These projections diverge more from the base projections than the previous&#13;
alternative. Projected prevalence by region is, most of time, no more than 10&#13;
percent above or below the base figures in Table 21. Prevalence is&#13;
distributed differently across countries, however, and costs therefore vary&#13;
more. Under standard decline, costs are 9 percent lower in 1990 in this&#13;

alternative than base costs, 22 percent lower in 2000. Under rapid decline,&#13;
costs are 12 percent higher in 1990, 10 percent higher in 2000. Cost&#13;
requirements region by region are similarly all lower than base estimates&#13;
under standard decline, higher under rapid decline. Part of the explanation&#13;
is probably this: under standard decline, more (or larger) countries move&#13;
into Phases II and III of the fertility transition model, where fertility is&#13;
low even without contraception, and less contraception is therefore needed to&#13;
meet fertility targets. Under rapid decline, with countries assumed to be&#13;
undergoing faster changes, more countries have moved into Phase IV, where the&#13;
fertility-suppressing effect of breastfeeding has largely disappeared, and&#13;
more contraception is therefore needed.&#13;
These sets of alternative projections suggest that the results are&#13;
sensitive to assumptions about TUFR, and somewhat less sensitive to&#13;
assumptions about use-effectiveness. Required overall growth rates for&#13;
expenditures are not greatly changed in these alternative projections,&#13;
however. Constant 4 to 5 percent growth in still required to meet standard&#13;
decline projections, 6 to 7 percent growth required to meet rapid decline&#13;
projections.&#13;
Finally, it is interesting to ask how different the results would&#13;
have been if the projections had been done region by region instead of country&#13;
by country, using means from actual data and avoiding the need to estimate&#13;
missing values. Consider only the standard projection for 2000. The&#13;
necessary regional data (weighted means are preferable) can be assembled from&#13;
previous tables: regional mean total fertility rates for 2000 from Table 21;&#13;
current mean TUFRs and use-effectiveness rates from Table 18 (the TUFRs are&#13;
based on some estimated values, however); population figures from Table 19;&#13;
and costs per user from Table 8. Total 2000 expenditures, using these&#13;
regional means, would be $5,677 million, only 2 percent above the base&#13;
projection in Table 21, coming remarkably close. The regional projections&#13;
carry a different message. The estimate for sub-Saharan Africa is virtually&#13;
identical to the base projection, and the estimate for East Asia only 3&#13;
percent lower. However, the estimate for South Asia is 18 percent lower, for&#13;
the Middle East 27 percent higher, and for Latin America 51 percent higher.&#13;
Projecting expenditures country by country has in fact made an important&#13;
difference at the next higher level of aggregation.&#13;
Projecting private expenditures&#13;
To project private expenditures, assumptions similar to those for&#13;
public expenditures must be made. In addition, it will be assumed that (1)&#13;
the proportion of contraceptive users served by nonprogram sources stays&#13;
constant and (2) costs per nonprogram supply user either stay constant or bear&#13;
a constant relationship to number of users. Also, only the normal use-&#13;
effectiveness rates and constant TUFRs will be used here. Calculations then&#13;
are fairly straightforward.&#13;
Private expenditures should rise from $548 million in 1980 to $1,577&#13;
million (in 1980 dollars) in 2000 under standard fertility decline, and to&#13;
$2,131 million under rapid decline (Table 25). Growth rates in private&#13;
expenditures are very similar to the rates for public expenditures. Private&#13;
expenditures are therefore an essentially constant proportion of all&#13;
expenditures: 27 to 29 percent in the developing world as a whole. As&#13;

earlier observed, this percentage varies considerably across regions; however,&#13;
it appears largely constant within regions across periods, except in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, where it falls from 38 to 25 percent.&#13;
The alternative expenditure projections assuming that private costs&#13;
depend on number of users (Table 26) provide lower figures, whereas the&#13;
projections with private costs equal to program costs (Table 27) provide&#13;
higher figures. Over time, however, private expenditures are a relatively&#13;
constant proportion of all expenditures in both these alternatives, again with&#13;
the exception of sub-Saharan Africa in the first alternative.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
Total expenditures on population programs and family planning in the&#13;
developing world in 1980 are estimated to have been $2.6 billion. About 20&#13;
percent of this was private spending. This estimate relies on varied&#13;
expenditure data from different sources for different subsets of countries and&#13;
on similarly selective information on contraceptive use. From estimated 1980&#13;
expenditures in each country, per user costs were calculated and employed in&#13;
the projection of future resource requirements. By 2000, $7.1 billion will be&#13;
needed to achieve the standard fertility decline contained in the World Bank&#13;
population projections; $9.7 billion will be needed to achieve rapid fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;
Better data on expenditures would obviously have led to better&#13;
estimates. Apart from comparing figures from different sources, no attempt&#13;
has been made here to determine the soundness of the basic expenditure data.&#13;
An attempt to reconcile different figures for particular countries and to&#13;
determine how the money is actually spent would probably provide insights that&#13;
could alter the estimates.&#13;
Some analysis was directed to determining how user costs might change&#13;
in the future.   Inconsistent results were obtained, however, and further&#13;
detailed work to determine when and why user costs change is essential. The&#13;
financial implications of changes in the contraceptive mix need study, as do&#13;
the implications of variations in program structure, such as basing programs&#13;
within communities and integrating them with health or other social programs.&#13;
The estimate of the private share of family planning expenditures is&#13;
probably less reliable than the estimate of the public share. Data on private&#13;
costs and on private contraceptive use are more sparse. Similarly,&#13;
understanding is lacking of the reasons why the private share is larger or&#13;
smaller. Consequently this share has been assumed to be constant, although it&#13;
is unlikely to be constant in the future. This assumption affects only the&#13;
private cost estimates and not the public costs estimates, which are based on&#13;
all users.&#13;
Resource requirement projections depend on projections of&#13;
contraceptive users. These projections were made in more detail--country by&#13;
country--and with more initial data than other similar projections. Further&#13;
refinement is certainly possible, however, and three areas for improvement&#13;
might be noted. First, the assumption that married women of reproductive age&#13;

are a constant proportion of the populatilon could be replaced tyith specific&#13;
estimates in each country based on age structure and proporticos marrying at&#13;
each age. Second, the use-effectiveness estimates could be reined, and&#13;
anticipated changes in use-effectiveness taken into account. "h-!rd, a better&#13;
understanding of the total unplanned fertility rate (TUFR) migh.t allow better&#13;
prediction of its future courses in contrast to the crude pattern applied in&#13;
an alternative projection here.&#13;
Taking the resource projections at face value leads to the question&#13;
of whether resources on the scale required will be availableo The trend in&#13;
international donor support for population activities is not erncouraging, but&#13;
whether the trend will continue over the next decade is not knoun0&#13;
Expenditures by developing-country governments will probably rlse0 An&#13;
increasing number are setting specific fertility targets, often, fairly&#13;
ambitious ones0 To the extent these are taken seriously, substantial&#13;
subsequent financial commitments might be expected0 Nevertheless both&#13;
commitment and funding may be inadequate in many areas0    Hill rivate spending&#13;
make up the gap?  This might be possible In some more advanced developing&#13;
countries, though the government stimulus is probably essentdal0 Creative&#13;
ways to recover some costs from clients, without discouraging ootential users&#13;
or burdening those least able to pay, may be needed0 In the least developed&#13;
areas, government and foreign donor funding of population programs vill&#13;
continue to be essential0 Should subsequent funding fall shorc of&#13;
requirements, possibilities for running programs more cheaply and wore&#13;
efficiently will receive increasing attention0&#13;
Even with adequate funding, some sub-Saharan and Sout&gt; Asian&#13;
countries will probably still face considerable problems0 Where public&#13;
acceptance of and political commitiaent to fertility control is lacking and the&#13;
administrative capacity to run programs efficiently does not exist, it may be&#13;
difficult to absorb additional funds and utllize them effectively. Limits to&#13;
absorptive capacity are not of course fii£edo Over time, public acceptance can&#13;
spread; political commitment to providing services may be nurt-.red; management&#13;
styles can adapt; and infrastructure can gradually be put in placeo The focus&#13;
on financial requirements in this paper should not obscure the fact that other&#13;
social changes are needed too for current population projectiocs to be met0&#13;

a/ Considered nonsupply methods are abstinence, rhythm, withdrawal, and&#13;
traditional methods.&#13;
b/ Women who are pregnant, who consider themselves or their partner infecund,&#13;
or who are breastfeeding a child under one year old are considered not&#13;
exposed. Only unmet need for limrLting births, and not for spacing, is&#13;
considered.&#13;

            Expenditures on population programs in

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            From data on population program
            expenditures in 46 countries, estimates are derived for
            total expenditures in the major regions of the developing
            world in 1980. In all, about $2 billion was spent by
            external donors and developing country governments on
            population programs: $1.2 billion in East and Southeast
            Asia, $300 million in South Asia, $200 million in Latin
            America and the Caribbean, and $100 million each in the
            Middle East and North Africa and in Subsaharan Africa.
            Private family planning expenditures, estimated from data on
            the cost of different contraceptive methods and on
            nonprogram contraceptive use, added over $500 million to the
            total. Future resource requirements up to the year 2000 are
            estimated assuming constant costs per contraceptive user,
            with number of users derived from alternative population
            projections. Resource requirements increase proportionally.
            For the developing world as a whole, public expenditures
            will have to grow at a constant 5 percent a year in the
            standard projection to $5.6 billion in 2000. To achieve a
            more rapid fertility decline, expenditures will have to grow
            at 7 percent a year to $7.6 billion in 2000. More than in
            other regions, expenditures will have to grow at a faster
            rate in Subsaharan Africa.
