Abstract&#13;
This paper develops an analytical framework to examine the Brazilian&#13;
economy. A macro economic projection model is developed based on a consis-&#13;
tency framework for 1980.&#13;
After 1980 the Brazil economy began to show many serious weaknesses,&#13;
unemployment rose rapidly, the current account deteriorated, and the external&#13;
debt rose to over US$90 billion by 1983.&#13;
The projections suggest that even relatively strong growth rates of&#13;
around 6 percent per annm although large enough to support the absorption of&#13;
increases in the labor force will not be sufficient to reduce the pool of&#13;
unemployed that has accumulated during the recession.&#13;
It seems that the development strategy or the sixties and seventies&#13;
and the concomitant technology is no longer adequate. On the external side&#13;
the recent performance in the merchandise balance by Brazil has been quite&#13;
strong but it is essential to maintain this highly favorable balance ir the&#13;
current account, and the debt servicing required is to remain within accept-&#13;
able limits. This in turn implies that Import expansion should be strongly&#13;
conditioned by a favorable export performance. The multi-sectoral nature of&#13;
the model provides considerable insight into analyzing which sectors may be&#13;
most appropriate for various initiatives and where one may expect unfavorable&#13;
consequences.&#13;
A viable policy package to lower unemployment, maintain domestic&#13;
balance and curb debt accumulation will require a careful blending of&#13;
policies. The paper indicates which policy instruments may be appropriate for&#13;
various goals but the choice and blend will in the end be a polltical&#13;
decision.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
This paper seeks to Investigate the likely impact of alternoate policY&#13;
initiatiL yes on the Brazilian econcuy over the near to edium term. Inevitably&#13;
the business of projecting macroeconomic variables is precarious at the best&#13;
of times, but im Brazil it is even more so. The delicate economic balance is&#13;
further eomplicated by major changes in the political situation.&#13;
In the last three years, Brazillans have suffered sore eresion of&#13;
their real ineomes on a per capita basis than dwring the Great Depression.&#13;
This has wiped out much or the gains of the miracle years 1968-73. The&#13;
increased expectations of those years have evolved ir.to deep rrustration and&#13;
disillusionaent for most of the population. Many observers seen surprised&#13;
that manifestations of social mnrest have been rather limited but thin may be&#13;
due in part to the promise of a new political regime.&#13;
The econmic situation is particularly complicated by an external&#13;
debt estimated at close to US$100 billion in 1984. Policy making and attempts&#13;
at rescheduling the debt are crrently lnflaenced by IMF assessmnfts.  The&#13;
goals for monetary expansion, public deficit, and to a lesser extent, incomes&#13;
policy of that institution are identified with the generally contractlonary&#13;
measures adapted in the last few years. Attempts to tilt prices in favor of&#13;
the export sect~or have resulted in a major improvement in the merchandise&#13;
balance which is estimated at over US$13 biLlion for 1984. However, much or&#13;
the remainder of the economy is still flat especially those sectors rct able&#13;
to benefit from the strong export perfonmance.  This In turn poses a maor&#13;
unemployment problem. The general eoomic problem racing the av adinis-&#13;
tration ia finding a way to get- unemployment down, restore real inomes and&#13;
control inflation (currently over 200 percent per annun). The high lvels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2&#13;
both external and internal debt pose difficult constraints so that some&#13;
obvious political judgements will be needed on the various trade-offs&#13;
involved.&#13;
This paper seeks to make a contribution to indicGaing what some of&#13;
these trade-otfs night be and What aacroeconomic repercussions could be&#13;
expected from selective policy initiatives.  In the next (second) section of&#13;
the paper some recent policies are discussed, in particular, the response to&#13;
the second (1979) oil shock. In section three, the external sector is&#13;
reviewed and then the debt situation is considered. Section four provides the&#13;
analysis framnewcrk. There are two phases. In the first, a consistency&#13;
rraework is developed. For convenience, this is called a social accounting&#13;
structure.  It see.s to reconcile the principal accounts for 1980 and fors&#13;
the base year for a model used to make the projections. The model seeks to&#13;
incorporate most of the salient issues of interest. Among its features are&#13;
eight production sectors and separate accounts for the private, federal&#13;
enterprises and governrent sectors. There- is also an elaborate debt modiule&#13;
which facilitates the testing of alternate debt scenarios. While the model is&#13;
primarily Keynesian, there are some supply side features such as the likely&#13;
response of the economy to changes in the OECD growth rate. The model is&#13;
quite flexible and may be expanded as deemed necessarr. in particular it&#13;
would seem desirable that later versions might elaborate the cirrent, rather&#13;
crude, employment module and it would seem desirable to, at least, attempt to&#13;
endogenize the inflation rate.&#13;
Section five discusses a selection of policy runs. First a set of&#13;
'plausible' asumptions are made to generate a base case. Then a number of&#13;
-variants are eamerated to give some indication of the likely Impect of changes&#13;
in investment, taxation, OrCD growth, debt -escheduling. In eact: case the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
scenarios are projected to 1995. This is not because of any strong convictLon&#13;
that one can predict the economy that far, least of all that of Brazil, but&#13;
rather that many options take a number of years to show their true colors.&#13;
Thus a rescheduling with a five year grace period can look particularly&#13;
attractive if one limits ones horizon to 1990.&#13;
Finally, section six seeks to synthesize some of the reatures of&#13;
these runs and provide tentative guidelines for policy.&#13;

II. Recent Macroeconodic DevelopEents&#13;
2.1 The "Brazil Model"&#13;
In tne nineteen sixties and seventies, the Brazilan economy achieved&#13;
one of the highest growth rates in the world. The annual growth rate of GNP&#13;
on a per capita basis averaged close to 5 percent during this period. There&#13;
is an extensive literature on the 'Brazil model' for development, not only on&#13;
its impact on various groups in the Brazil experience, but also on whether&#13;
either the whole approach or part of it night be suitable for other developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
There is some debate on the extent to which the initial surge in&#13;
growth in the early sixties may be attributed to an enlightened policy regime&#13;
or simply the successful utilization of the excess capacity available at the&#13;
beginning of the decade. In any case by the late sixties and thereafter, very&#13;
large investments were required to sustain the growth, particularly in infra-&#13;
structure, power, transportation. A complex array of state and parastatal&#13;
organizations evolved to carry out this work. t/ Much of the financing for&#13;
these projects was facilitated by the availability of relatively cheap (in&#13;
real terms) foreign money. Up to the early seventies external balance was&#13;
achieved by a judicious mixture of incentives for export promotion together&#13;
with protective measures to stimulate domestic industry.&#13;
I/    For exaomle MNDES devoted most of its resources to infrastructure and&#13;
heavy industry. Knight et al. (1983) estimate that in 1978 BNDES&#13;
accounted for -40 percent of gross fized capital formation in the&#13;
industrial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
2.2 First Oil Shock&#13;
The euphoria of the miracle years was checked by the impact of the&#13;
oil shock of 1973. Brazil's dependence on imported oil induced a major&#13;
deterioration in the merchandise balance. The policy response in retrospect&#13;
seems to have been poorly conceived. Little domestic adjustment effort was&#13;
made either to curb the rapid growth of external debt or curb domestic oil&#13;
corisumption through adequate price adjustment.  The value of some of the&#13;
macroeconomic aggregates are given in Table 2.1. Even though GDP growth did&#13;
slow somewhat the planners choose to push ahead with a strong investment&#13;
progran. The deterioration in the balance of payments was further compounded&#13;
by increasing reliance on externai financing. The result was that debt grew&#13;
rapidly to reach over US$ 51 billion by 1979 while the ratio of debt&#13;
outstanding to GNP climbed rapidly to close to sixteen percent in that year&#13;
from 9.1 percent only six years earlier. At the same time the deficit on the&#13;
current balance exceeded US$ 10 billion. The failure to come to grips with&#13;
the external situation was matched by an inept performance on the domestic&#13;
balance. While govermuent deficits grew (consolidated governaent) there was&#13;
little effort to increase revenues but rather an undue relianoe on the&#13;
printing press.  This in turn led to a surge in inflation.  The consuner price&#13;
index in Rio, given in Table 2.1 as one measure of inflation, increased at an&#13;
average annual rate of around 20 percent over the decade 1965-75. This annual&#13;
rate swrged to 75.9 percent in 1979 and by 1984 grew to over 200 percent.&#13;
The "Brazil model" has also been subjected to considerable analysis&#13;
on equity grounds. During the decade of the seventies, average annual&#13;
population growth rate was about 2,5 percent while estimates- based on the&#13;
demographic census by Morley (1984) suggest that the population economically&#13;
active (10 years and older) grew at an annual rate or 3.7 percent largely&#13;

because of the increase in participation rates for wcmn. During the decade&#13;
real output grew at an annual rate or 8.6 pereent. This susaets an estimate&#13;
of 0.43 for the elasticity -r employment with respect to GDP. In the current&#13;
climate of much lower potential growth rates this "historical" elasticity&#13;
figure requires special consideration as one seeks to improve the employment&#13;
situation. 1  Indeed to the extent that the figure reflects a style of&#13;
development one must question whether drastic changes are needed in the&#13;
overall style to reduce unemployment levels.&#13;
2.3 The Second Oil Shock&#13;
In 1979 the Brazilian economy was in a rather delicate balance. Debt&#13;
had increased dramatically. The large Federal Enterprises which had proven&#13;
relatively successful in setting up the Infrastructure had come to assume an&#13;
ever increasing share in the economy. Many of their investments had long&#13;
gestation periods so that as a group they ran ever increasing deficits on&#13;
their current accounts. The style of development had a strong capital&#13;
intensi-e bias so that a rapidly growing work force could only be absorbed by&#13;
maintaining GDP growth rates of the order of eight percent.&#13;
This precarious economic situation was buffetted by a series of&#13;
adverse shocks. These included the seoond oil shock which saw oil prices in&#13;
1979-80 increase by a factor of two and one-half, slowdown in the world&#13;
economy after 1978, rise in interest rates starting in late 1978 and a&#13;
softening of commodity prices in 1981. The combined effect of these shocks on&#13;
Brazil has been estimated by Balassa and McCarthy (1984) as equivalent to 5.7&#13;
percent of Its-GNP over the-period t979-82. Two-thirds of this deterioration&#13;

estimates corresponding elasticities by sector.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

may be attributed to terms of trade losses with increased interest rate&#13;
changes accoumting for much of the remainder.&#13;
The policy response to this second oil shock suggests that not many&#13;
lessons had been learned from the dissapointing outcome of the policies&#13;
adopted for the first oil shock. For the second shock the economy was in a&#13;
much weaker position and less amenable to the vacillation which ensued. A&#13;
number of these policy variables are suomarized in Table 2.2. It is&#13;
interesting to compare the policies adopted in other countries when faced with&#13;
similar external shocks. Balassa and McCarthy suggest that countries which&#13;
did not seek the relatilely easy option (in the short term) of Increased&#13;
external borrowing tended to do better.&#13;
A stabilization program was first introduced, to counter the second&#13;
oil shock. The new government took office in early 1979. A faw months later a&#13;
new eoonomic team opted for expansionary measures. This allowed high economic&#13;
growth rate to continue to 1980. However, the price for this misguided policy&#13;
was hiher inflation and a further acceleration of foreign borrowing. By late&#13;
1980 It became evident that the policy was not sustainable. For 1980 the&#13;
inflation rate was 100.2 percent, medium and long term debt exceeded US$ 56&#13;
bil'7ion while the current account balance was US$ 12.8 billion. Real per&#13;
capita consumption reached its peak at 132 in 1980 (base year 1973.100).&#13;
Adjustment measures were introduced in late 1980. Monetary policy&#13;
becate highly restrictive. Domestic energy prices were increased and this&#13;
coupled with an active domestic production policy helped curb oil imports.&#13;
This led to an absolute decline of GNP. Domestic credit was tightened and&#13;
this in turn pushed up interest rates.. This was followed in 1983 by further&#13;
attempts to rein in the seemingly autonomous expenditure practices of the&#13;
federal enterprises. In 1983 wages adjustment was indexed to about 85 percent&#13;

or the CPI change in an attempt to curb inflation but this was partially&#13;
offset by increases in various public service charges to improve govermuent&#13;
finances.&#13;
On the trade side, the overall thrust now favored the export sector,&#13;
with the real effective exchange rate depreciating to 149.1 (frcm a base level&#13;
average of 100 for 1976-78). Exports (current $US) increased by 8.5 percent&#13;
in 1983 and a further 23.3 percent in 1984. This was coupled with import&#13;
limitation on many items, so that the merchandise trade surplus reached&#13;
US$ 13.2 billion in 1984. But as exports account for less than 10 percent of&#13;
GNP in Brazil, even such a remarkable performance does not seem capable of&#13;
pulling up the rest of the economy very quickly. In view of the rising&#13;
expectations it is not evident that another year of recession will be pol-&#13;
itically acceptable. The imposed 3-year recession has achieved little on the&#13;
inflation front while the export success is largely consumed by mounting&#13;
charges on the external debt.&#13;
The challenge facing policy makers is how to return the economy to a&#13;
viable gowth rate, reduce the pool of unemployed which accummu'-ated during&#13;
the last three years, and restore the standard of living which has eroded&#13;
during the recession. The question is how this should be done while keeping&#13;
the debt situation tractable and preferably improving, or at least not&#13;
exacerbating inflationary pressures. Before proceeding to a macroeconomic&#13;
study of these issues we first consider two.of the critical areas -- the&#13;
external sector and the debt situation.&#13;
&#13;

III. External Sector&#13;
3.1   Exports/Imports&#13;
The external sector in Brazil has played a nunber of roles in reoent&#13;
years. In the 1960s the import substitution strategy in a number of sectors&#13;
resulted in merchadise exports being dominated by agricultural goods. In 1970&#13;
total exports to GDP ratio was a rather modest 5.2 percent with agriculture&#13;
accounting for about two thirds of these. As Brazil moved towards a more&#13;
export oriented strategy this ratio rose to 7.9 percent in 1980 and even&#13;
further to 8.4 percent in 1984.  Even more pronounced has been the&#13;
diversification of exports with agriculture falling to a third in 1984 as&#13;
exports of manufactures increased. These composition changes are summarized&#13;
in Table 3.1.&#13;
On the other hand, Import merchandise grew from 5.5 percent of GDP in&#13;
1970 to 9.0 percent in 1980. Capital goods accounted for 36 percent of&#13;
imports in 1970 as the share had fallen to 20 percent by 1980. The share for&#13;
internediate goods went from 38 percent in 1970 to 25 percent in 1980. Under&#13;
the contractionary pressures of the last few years import were again cut back&#13;
to reach 5.3 percent of GDP in 1984.&#13;
Thus the external sector in';eracts with the overall macroeconomic&#13;
situation in a number of ways. Exports obviously contribute to aggregate&#13;
demand but being only 10 percent or less of GNP account for only a small&#13;
portion of the labor force. Imports provide various critical inputs to&#13;
production for both domestic and external markets. There has been some&#13;
discussion I' in the literature on what a critical level for imports would&#13;
be.  If one postulates a fixed coefficient type of production function then&#13;

the import share in production becomes critical. In the analysis developed&#13;
here the import share coefficient is different tor each sector and sensitirity&#13;
analysis is used to investigate the repercussions of possible changes. This&#13;
approach seems preferable to estimating the coefficient over time since the&#13;
Brazilian economy has undergone so much structural change in the last few&#13;
years.&#13;
Besides the roles of exports in effective demand and that of imports&#13;
in providing critical inputs for production there is also the requirement to&#13;
generate net foreigi- exchange to meeT debt obligations. During the develop-&#13;
ment phase of the seventies the merchandise balance was negative but this&#13;
changed dramatically by 1984 it reached a level of $13.1 billion. This was&#13;
achieved partly by reducing imports through a lower level of economic activity&#13;
and various rest-ictions but primarily by a stronger export performance.&#13;
There are many reasons which may account for their strong export perfor-&#13;
mance. These range from conventional reasons such as the atrong OECD growth&#13;
performance, more favorable exchange rate policy to a theory of extraction at&#13;
unfavorable terms. t/ Proponents of the latter suggest that producers faced&#13;
by lower and lower levels of capacity utilization have become willing to dump&#13;
their output abroad even under highly unfavorable prices. Regression&#13;
estimates for exports are given in Table 3.2. 2/&#13;
1/    Ciine's studies of 19 maJor debtors (1983-1984) estimates elasticity for&#13;
Brazil manufactures and oommoditles with respect to OECD growth at 2.0&#13;
and 1.0 respectively. Dornbusch and Fischer (1984) estimate the&#13;
elasticity for non oil exports at 1.15 but also have a trend term of 4.3&#13;
percent- The Morgan Guaranty model (Filatov 1985) estimates the&#13;
elasticity for manufacturers at 2.4 with coinodities at 1.80.&#13;

export projections do use the elasticity estimates for xindustrial&#13;
country groith.&#13;

It is interesting to :iote that the elasticity for real exports (in&#13;
real terms) with respect to OECD GDP is 2.74. The corresponding level for&#13;
exports in value terms would be somewhat less due to soae deterioration in the&#13;
terms of trade. The coefficients obtained for the capacity utilization&#13;
variable - are quite interesting. In the aggregate regression the elasticity&#13;
is -0.91 suggesting that deteriorating capacity utilization is associated with&#13;
increased exports. This is also true for the capital manufactures sector&#13;
which was particularly hard hit by the recession. The sector specific real&#13;
effective exchange rate is most significant for agricultural exports.&#13;
Thus in siumary it is noted that real exports can be expected to&#13;
increase by about US$750 million for each 1 percent increase in OECD GDP.&#13;
These equations are incorporated into the modelling framework.&#13;
Prices for exports and imports are entered exogenously. These price&#13;
forecasts were developed by the World Bank commodities division fram their&#13;
global analysis. 2J   Short s-mmaries are provided in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 for&#13;
exports and imports respectively. On the export side these projections&#13;
suggest that among agricultural commodities there is modest optimism for&#13;
coffee and non-traditional crops. Even over the long term the prospects for&#13;
any significant recovery for sugar prices are poor while those for cocoa are&#13;
only slightly better. Semi-processed goods and manufactures seem to offer&#13;
better prospects.&#13;

Turning to the import side, the shifts in import prices leading to&#13;
the deterioration in the terms of trade can be seen. In particular, oil&#13;
prices (see Table 3.4) are expected to more than double (in real terms) by&#13;
1995 from their 1984 base value and capital goods prices should more than&#13;
equal ttat increase. The sharp price increases for metals and fertilizers are&#13;
not as worrying as Brazil can be expected to offset much of the metals&#13;
(primarily copper) imports by that time. Similarly as additional domestic&#13;
production of phosphate and potassiUm based fertilizers comes on line, the&#13;
importance or the increase in fertilizer import prices will diminish. The&#13;
case for capital goods imports is more complex. Domestic policy initiatives&#13;
may seek to offset some of the projected Import demand. However, the effects&#13;
of such Dolicies on efficiency and growth are uncertain.&#13;
In closing this section it should be noted that while Brazil's trade&#13;
performance has been excellent of late, the share of trade in its economic&#13;
activity is small ccapared with such outward oriented economies as Korea,&#13;
Taiwan or Singapore. Thus, at least for the near term, good performance in&#13;
this area alone will not be sufficient to drive total domestic activity. On&#13;
the other hand, Brazil's market share is sizable for many export commodi-&#13;
ties. Thus the assunption that Brazil is a price taker must be viewed with&#13;
caution in the interpretation of its trade figures.&#13;
3.2   External Debt&#13;
Brazil has the dubious honor of having one of the highest external&#13;
debts among developing oountries. The expansionary policies which Brazil&#13;
sought to pursue following the first oil shock required massive increases in&#13;
foreign borrowing. The data are simnarized in Table 3.5.&#13;

Most of the increased external borrowing was either public or&#13;
publicly guaranteed. Thus, while non-guaranteed medium and long term debt&#13;
rose from US$5.2 billion in 19T3 to US$23.1 billion in 1982, public/publicly&#13;
guaranteed debt rose from US$7.5 billion to US$47.6 billion during that same&#13;
period (see Table 3.5). Private creditors provided all but US$9.1 billion of&#13;
this additional mediun and long term lending. The average terms of this debt&#13;
changed from an interest rate of 8.6 percent and maturity of 13.3 years in&#13;
1973 to 13.0 percent interest and 11.2 years maturity in 1982. While this&#13;
movement in terms was obviously detrimental from the Brazilian perspective, it&#13;
should be noted that the maturity structure was not quite as bad as in many&#13;
other countries, e.g., Mexico before the current rescheduling.&#13;
By 1983 Brazil's total outstanding foreign debt is estimated to have&#13;
reached US$91.6 billion. This included arrears of US$2.3 billion and an IMF&#13;
disbursement of US$2.6 billion. The medium and long term component of 1983&#13;
debt is estimated as being US$81.3 billion, of which, US$4.1 billion was&#13;
refinanced amortization. It is estimated that in '983 about 80% of the medium&#13;
and long term debt was either floating or variable rate. In 1984 the total&#13;
debt increased further but much of this increase was offset by an improvement&#13;
in reserves.&#13;
In this exercise the currently existing disbursement-service pipeline&#13;
for foreign financing is taken as an input. The source for this data is the&#13;
World Bank Debt Division based on data from the Debt Reporting System. This&#13;
pipeline includes data from official lending sources (i.e., World Bank, IMF,&#13;
Paris Club, Inter-American Development Bank, bilateral goverrment) as well as&#13;
private sources (suppliers credits, guaranteed and non-guaranteed debt). This&#13;
exercise has the capability of generating flows and stocks for new loans in each&#13;
source category, with the resulting output entering the model solution process.&#13;

Among the is5ues considered in this analysis is the impact or changes&#13;
in interest rates. In 1984 about US$8 billion in interest payments was made&#13;
on variable rate obligations. This suggests that a I percent fall in interest&#13;
rates w,ould result In a saving of around US$800 million for Brazil. Thus one&#13;
is faced with an interesting policy question. Would Brazil be better off with&#13;
strong OECCD growth perfornance even at the cost of higher interest rates? The&#13;
analysis would provide scane insight on this question and estimate Just what&#13;
the tradeoffs are.&#13;

IV. Macroeconomic Framework&#13;
In this section we develop a framework to provide projections of the&#13;
economy under alternate macro assumptions. The approach adopted is to first&#13;
develop a unified data base. This is done in the form of a social accounting&#13;
structure for 1980. A model is tren developed which seeks to incorporate most&#13;
of the salient variables. This is tuned using available data for 1981, 1982,&#13;
1983, and to a lesser extent 1984. 1/ Finally a set of projections are&#13;
developed under various assumptions.&#13;
4L1   Social Accounting Structure (SAM) 1980&#13;
The data set used in this analysis is based on the principal accounts&#13;
for 1980. These accounts are given in Appendix A, while the extended data&#13;
base termed a SAH is given in Table 4.1.  The details of how the SAM was cons-&#13;
tructed are given in Appendix D. Inevitably there are the usual trade-offs ir&#13;
designing a SAM.  In this instance, the primary function of the SAM is to&#13;
provide a consistent framework to serve as a data base for making the macro&#13;
projeCtions.  It was considered desirable to be able to investigate alternate&#13;
export growth rates, changes in import intensities, various investment scen-&#13;
arios for private, federal enterprises and goverrnment, and modifications in&#13;
tax levels. The one major area of interest that is not adequately modelled at&#13;
this stage is the role of inflation. For the moment factor prices enter&#13;
exogenously but since there are eight producing sectors, one can experiment&#13;
with alternate intersectoral relative factor prices. The financial sector is&#13;
1/    The appropriate type of social accounting requires the usual considera-&#13;
tions of trade otf between complexity, data availability, and time and&#13;
manpower available to carry out the exercise. For an introduction to&#13;
social aceounts see Pyatt 1976. Examples of the use of SAMs in model&#13;
building are given in Taylor 1979.&#13;

The basic SAM structure as shown in Table 4.1 has the following&#13;
principal features:&#13;
8 sectors          -    agriculture, agro-processing, construction,&#13;
manufactures of capital goods, other&#13;
manufactures, electricity gas water transport and&#13;
ocmmunication, financial intermediaries and&#13;
realtors, other services.&#13;
3 institutions     -    private&#13;
federal enterprises I/ (the ten largest),&#13;
govermnent (central, state and municipal)&#13;
3 capital accounts -    private, federal enterprises, government&#13;
2 financial accounts    -domestic, foreign.&#13;
The framework Is quite flexible and may be modified relatively&#13;
easily. It is to be emphaized that the model is primarily designed to provide&#13;
projections and thereby Illuminate likely outcome of various policy options.&#13;
If additional information on other economic variables of interest such as&#13;
employment or inflation become available then this may be incorporated.&#13;
However, In many instances the current data availability situation and recent&#13;
sharp changes in economic and political structures make it difficult if not&#13;
unwise to seek very elaborate econometric estlaates of some of the variables.&#13;
A number of extensions have been made to the current framework these&#13;
include -r(dules for employment and factor markets. Employment projections are&#13;
made for each of the eight sectors based on the elasticity of employment with&#13;
respect to sectoral value added. Factor markets are analyzed by adding a non-&#13;
linear algorithm. This allows one to develop a series of prices in four markets&#13;
for labor and capital under market clearing and disequtlibrium conditions.&#13;
1f   These are:  ELECTROBRAS, SIDERBRAS, TELEBRAS, RFFSA, ACESITA, ITAIPU,&#13;
PETROBRAS, CVRD, NUCLEBRAS, and PORTOBRAS.&#13;

4.2 How the Model Works&#13;
This SAM served as the basis for a model. The structure is primarily&#13;
Keynesian to reflect the current economic climate in Brazil. However a number&#13;
of supply side effects are added to analyze the situation in the mediun term&#13;
when the economy is projected to become more buoyant. A formal statement of&#13;
the model is given in Appendix B. A highly simplified schematic is given in&#13;
Table 4.2. In this particular schematic closure is affected by assuming that&#13;
the short term financing will be forthcoming to close the current account&#13;
although other closures can be accommodated by the model. In other work some&#13;
other closures are considered to examine the consequences of limited&#13;
availability of external resources.&#13;
4.3  Consumption&#13;
Consumption is determined endogenously.  Coefficients for a linear&#13;
expenditure system were estimated by Williamson (1981). In the current highly&#13;
inflationary climate there is a strong tendency to consume out of wealth so&#13;
that changes in consumption through the wealth effect may be Lunderestimated.&#13;
The various consumption categories are mapped into the eight sectors given in&#13;
the SAM.&#13;
4.4  Final Demand&#13;
For each of the eight sectors, exogenous estimates are provided for&#13;
current oonsumption by goverruent together with investment demand by private,&#13;
federal enterprises and governrent. This is then combined with private&#13;
constuption and export demand to yield a vector of final demand for the eight&#13;
sectors. Exports are obtained as a function of OECD income levels, real&#13;
effective exchange rate and domestic capacity utilization.&#13;

4.5 Gross Production&#13;
Gross production Is next computed through a generalized Leontief&#13;
procedure. The final demand rector is then combined with an estimated&#13;
input/output matrix to yield an estimate of gross production in physical terms&#13;
for each of the eight sectors.&#13;
4.6 Imports&#13;
Intermediate imports by sector are computed in physical terms through&#13;
a constant coefficient per unit of gross output. While the value of the&#13;
coefficients may be changed from year to year it is essential that the&#13;
underlying economics for such a change be appropriate. Imports of capital&#13;
goods are entered exogenously. This completes the real side of the model.&#13;
4.7  Prices&#13;
Sectoral Prices are determined by Intermediate prices, import costs,&#13;
government taxes and transfers together with factor costs. Factor costs in&#13;
each sector include wages and capital of the private and federal enterprise&#13;
sectors. !/ The scenarios reported in this paper use exogenous factor&#13;
prices.  However, a subroutine is also available which allois for flexible&#13;
factor markets. 2/&#13;
4.8 Value Added&#13;
Value added is next computed by sectors. This together with&#13;
elasticity estimates provides an estimate (albeit rather crude) of sectoral&#13;
employment levels. It is important to note that these seetoral elasticities&#13;
are estimated frcm the experience of 1970s. As such they implicitly reflect&#13;
the historical experience of that period. This was a period with value added&#13;
1/   The introduction of factor market markets create certain technical&#13;
problems so that initial runs use exogenous levels for factor prices.&#13;
Recent analysis (Canargo 1984) suggests that price formation should also&#13;
include the effect of accumulated debt by firms.&#13;

growing at rates around 8 percent per anrum while employment grew at 3 percent&#13;
so that the style of development tended to have a strong pro capital bias in&#13;
cost sectors. it&#13;
4.9 Income-Expenditure&#13;
From the value added one obtains income for private sector and&#13;
federal enterprise. After adjusting for savings, direct taxes and transfers&#13;
this provides an estimate for private expenditure. 2/&#13;
4.10 Government&#13;
Government revenues are obtained by indirect taxes assessed as a&#13;
proportion of value added and direct taxes on income. At this stage the model&#13;
does not distinguish the use of returns to capital and labor while corpora-&#13;
tions are included under the 'private' institution label.&#13;
4.11 Saving-Investment&#13;
Each of the three institutions then has a saving and investment&#13;
estimate, SAVP, SAVE, SAVG corresponding to the current account balance for&#13;
private, federal enterprises and government. These are then combined with&#13;
foreign savings SAVF and the model Iterates until total savings equals total&#13;
investmwent.&#13;
4.12 Debt Module&#13;
Once savings investment equilibrium is established, the model then&#13;
computes the resources needed to close the current account. In this&#13;
particular closure it is assumed that this level of financing will be&#13;
1/   Some readers Of the first draft of tnis paper suggest that elasticities&#13;
should be higher as the economy rebounds.&#13;
2/   It is important to note that low labor absorption and high growth rates&#13;
do not necessarily Imply high levels of capital intensity.  The high&#13;
growth achieved by Korea, for instance, was not unduly capital&#13;
Intensive. However they were able to achieve substantial efficiency&#13;
gains.&#13;

rorthooming as medium or short term financing.  This is then added to the&#13;
total debt and the model moves on to the next year. Within each year the&#13;
input-output coefficitits remain constant but before proceeding to the&#13;
following year they are updated to reflect relative price changes.&#13;
In order to assess various policy alternatives, the model is used to&#13;
first develop a base run. In some sense thls may be taken to reflect an even&#13;
keel policy package but it still requires a number of arsumptions. These are&#13;
next discussed.&#13;

V. Policy Scenarios&#13;
At this juncture in the eccnomic developmert of Brazil, there are a&#13;
great variety of policy initiatives of interest. These range from strong&#13;
laissez-faire liberalized trade regimes to autarky at the other extreme.  In&#13;
addition there are a number of variables outside the reach of Brazilian policy&#13;
makers which can exert a heavy influence on the economic prospects. These&#13;
include the impact of OECD economic performance on trade prospects, the&#13;
effects of U.S. monetary and fiscal policy on world capital markets. At this&#13;
stage it was decided to analyze a small number of scenarios which would&#13;
attempt to stylize the relevant parame_ers. In order to examine the relative&#13;
impact of each one needs a norm or base case.&#13;
5.1 Base Case&#13;
Ideally the base case should reflect an unchanged policy regime.&#13;
Even here the situation is complicated by the anticipated political changes&#13;
and the general feeling that the economy will have to pick ip sharply from the&#13;
dismal performance of the last three years. This performance is summarized in&#13;
Table 5.1. One observes that much of the domestic adjustment was accomplished&#13;
by having a sharp contraction in real investment. Total investment as a share&#13;
of GDP fell from 22.5 percent in 1980 to 15.1 percent in 1984.  Private&#13;
consumption remained fairly constant during this period.  It is estimated that&#13;
unemployment grew during this time from a relatively nominal 3.5 percent of&#13;
all work Iorce in 1980 to around 13 percent In 1984. I'&#13;
1/   There is no consistent data series available that covers employment in&#13;
all seetors. The official figures suggest that between 7 to 9 percent of&#13;
the population economically active ten years and over are unemployed in&#13;
metrowlitan areas (March 198X, FIBGE), however when one includes all&#13;
sectors and allois for some fall in participation rates a higher figure&#13;
results (see Morley, 1985).&#13;

On the positive side, the merchandise balance in 1984 is estimated at&#13;
US$13.2 billion while the surplus of the consolidated non financial public&#13;
sector is estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP in 1984 down fram a deficit of 5.5&#13;
percent in 1980.&#13;
If one limits ones attention to these performance measures then a&#13;
base case scenario should seek to restore a viable level of investment and&#13;
increase employment, while seeking to maintain much of the monentui in the&#13;
external sector and holding the public sector balance in line.&#13;
5.2 Assumption&#13;
The assunptions underlying the base run are stmarized in&#13;
Table 5.2. Although the model itself determines the growth rate of GDP, the&#13;
values for exogenous variables are projected with the understanding that the&#13;
growth rate of the econamy for the period through 1985 will be of the order of&#13;
6 percent per annum. In order to restore the capital stock, it is necessary&#13;
to have investment grow even faster. Most of this increase in investment&#13;
spending is expected to come fram the private sector while goverrment&#13;
investment will grow at a lower rate and federai enterprises at an even lower&#13;
rate. By 1995 the three are projected to have real growth rates of 12&#13;
percent, 9.2 percent, and 5.8 percent, respectively. Goverrment current&#13;
consumption is expected to average around 6 percent to 19ff and then to fall&#13;
to 3.5 percent by 1995. This will reduce the share of goverrment consumption&#13;
in GDP to about 7. 5 percent at that time but would still allcw for a modest&#13;
annual per capita increase in government expenditures of about 1 percent&#13;
throughout the projection period.&#13;

5.-3- Exporta&#13;
Exports of goods and non factor services are projected to decline in&#13;
real terns by 6 percent in 1985 from the unusual level attained in 1984 and&#13;
then to resume growth in real terms by 5 to 6 percent per annum frcm 1986 to&#13;
1995. The quantum indices are given in Table 5.3 by commodity. Note in&#13;
particular that other manufactures are expected to reach 292 by 1995 frcm a&#13;
base of 100 in 1980. Given the past history, this does not see an&#13;
unreasonable assumption frcm Brazil's point of view but may be moderated by&#13;
growth performance and protectionist measures adopted by trading partners.&#13;
Some of the uncertainty may be reduced by various barter and counter trade&#13;
arrangements. -&#13;
5.4 Imports&#13;
Imports of capital goods are projected to return to 1983 levels and&#13;
then grow at around 4.5 percent frca  1987 onwards.  The other imports are&#13;
computed by the model through sectoral coefficients that can be varied&#13;
parametrically. in 1980 the ratio was 10.9 percent of GDP, but then by import&#13;
compression and import substitution initiatives, It fell to close to 6 percent&#13;
in 1984.  In the base run assumptions it is projected to return steadily to a&#13;
9.5 percent level by 1995. However, one scenario investigates changes from&#13;
this level.&#13;
5.5 External Factors&#13;
Interest rates on short and medium-term borrowing follow current&#13;
World Bank projections as does the OEMD growth rate. Exports appear to be&#13;
quite sensitive to the OECD growth rate. This observation is highlighted by&#13;
having two scenarios to examine the impact of' alternate OECD performance.&#13;

Middle Eastern oil producers.&#13;

5.6 Direct Foreign Investment&#13;
Here the astsuptions suggest a modest improvement in capital flows in&#13;
response to overall improvement in economic climate and favorable treatment&#13;
for their flow.&#13;
5.7 Employment&#13;
The treatment of employment in the model should be considered care-&#13;
fully when interpreting the results. There are two key sets of assumptions.&#13;
On the supply side, little change is projected for growth rate of numbers&#13;
participating in the labor force. The annvual growth rate at around 3.5&#13;
percent has been quite high in the 1970s as a buoyant economy attracted more&#13;
women Into the work force. If there is large unemployment, the participation&#13;
rate could be expected to fall.&#13;
On the demand side we use the elasticities of employment with respect&#13;
to sectoral value added 2/ so that alternate policy initiatives could be&#13;
expected to change then (preferably upwards). The critical data for the&#13;
employment module are simnarized in Table 5.4.  In view of the crucial&#13;
importance of employment for eoonomic planning it seems that this module&#13;
should be elaborated.&#13;
5.8 Results&#13;
The results are first presented for the base case. This is then&#13;
followed by a discussion of six other scenarios. Alterr.ate scenarios may be&#13;
generated relatively easily so that the particular one discussed here should&#13;
simply be interpreted as alternate technical solutions to provide insight on&#13;
the range of possible outcomes. They do not in any way imply political or&#13;
social feasibility. These scenarios are:&#13;
I/   In view of the recent increase in agricultural employment the elasticity&#13;
for that sector might equal to zero rather than the value negative 0.3&#13;
that the 1970s data suggest.&#13;

The base case is discussed in soae detail&#13;
while the others may be viewed as variants&#13;
about the scenario. Any policy implications&#13;
are delayed to Section 6.&#13;
5.9   Scenario 1:  Base Case -- Table 5.5&#13;
For the base case we have discussed most of the assumptions. The&#13;
results are presented in Table 5.5.&#13;
One observes that after remaining steady in 1985, the economy steadily&#13;
moves up to an annual growth rate in the range of 5.5 to 6 percent. This&#13;
implies that CDFPAapita by 1989 would be restored to its level of 1980.&#13;
However, the employment situation is rather ominous. Subject to the assumptions&#13;
used about cons-ant participation rates and elasticities based on the experience&#13;
of the 197Os the growth rate of 5.5 to 6 percent would not be sufficient to make&#13;
any dent in the unemployment pool accumulated in depression years. Indeed it&#13;
could be expected to possibly rise into the foreseeable future unless sane&#13;
alternative policies are in place. The depleticn of much of the capital stock&#13;
during the last few years is expected to be rectified by a steady rise in new&#13;
investment led by the private sector. This will bring the share of Investment&#13;
in GDP to 21.8 in t995, above its pre-depression level.&#13;
On the balance of payments the merchandise balance is expected to&#13;
grow from US$10 billion in 1985 to US$27 billion in 1995 In ctrrent dollars.&#13;
rhe current account is close to balance by 1989 and thereafter turns pos-&#13;
itive.  This in turn implies _hat the total debt outstanding (medium and long&#13;
tern) would peak at about US$108 billion in 1995 and then proceed to fall.&#13;

The steady increase in exports reinforces this improvement as the debt service&#13;
ratio falls monotonically to a level of 24.4 percent by 1995.  On the domestic&#13;
side the def!cit for the federal enterprises -  is projected to stay in the&#13;
range -1.4 to -1.7 percent of GDP. This will be offset by surplus generated&#13;
by the government so that the deficit of the consolidated non-financial public&#13;
sector should become positive by 1985 and by 1995 is projected to reach 4.3&#13;
percent of GDP.&#13;
5.10 Scenario 2: OECD Recession -- Table 5.6&#13;
In the base case scenario it was evident that much of the 'good'&#13;
outccme hinged on maintaining a strong export performance.  This in tun is&#13;
predicated on a monotonic increase in the OECD economy. Historically there is&#13;
a well known business cycle. In the US one may expect a mini recession every&#13;
four rears. This is simulated by allowing OECD growth rates to fall below the&#13;
base case level .j 2.5 percent in 1986, 0.5 percent in 1987 and then rise&#13;
above the base case level by 0.5 percent in 1988. The outcome is summarized&#13;
in Table 5.6. The results show that exports of merchandise goods would be set&#13;
back by about US$2 billion in 1986. Th.e impact on the nerchandise balance in&#13;
that year would be slightly less as the slowdown in economic activity would&#13;
lower import demand. However, the cunulative impact on the stock of debt&#13;
would be quite draematic as it is now projected to rise to close to US$138&#13;
billion by 1995.  The employment situation would also be somewhat worse than&#13;
in the base case.&#13;

5.11 Scenario 3: OECD Optimistic -- Table 5.7&#13;
In this scenario we look on the bright side. While the scenario is&#13;
predicated on an OECD growth rate above the norm the principal impact is&#13;
through a stronger export performance. Such a performance could result if&#13;
Brazil enjoyed any or all of a number of changes of fortune. This would&#13;
include reduction of trade barriers to its exports, a stronger performance by&#13;
some of its newer trading partners in the Middle East and Nigeria for ins-&#13;
tance, or also an improvement in its terms of trade. This latter could result&#13;
if the agriculture areas of Brazil had good harvests while some of its com-&#13;
petitors were less fortunate.&#13;
This optimisa is based on the assumption that OECD growth rate is 1%&#13;
percent above the base case from 1985 through 1995.  The results are sum-&#13;
marized in Table 5.7.&#13;
The outcome can be anticipated--a stronger GDP growth performance--&#13;
substantial improvement in the current balance while the debt outstanding and&#13;
disbursed (medium and long term) becomes net external lending of US$36 billion&#13;
by 1995. Impuiausible? -- perhaps, but such a seemingly large reversal of&#13;
fortunes is not quite as large as the losses Brazil suffered in recent years&#13;
due to deterioration in its terms of trade. Ironically even the berign eco-&#13;
nomic climate would not make any significant impact on the unemployment rate&#13;
without further policy initiatives. We now seek a scenario to attack the&#13;
problem directly.&#13;
5.12 Scenario 4: Increased Public investment -- Table 5.8&#13;
This scenario is designed to test the impact on employment by a&#13;
Keynesian increase in aggregate demand through increased investment in the&#13;
public 3ector. The simulation is done by assuning investment growth rates for&#13;
&#13;

both the federal enterprises and the goverrment 20 percent above the base case&#13;
level frr 1986 to 1990.&#13;
Initially the result proceeds as might be expected with a strong GDP&#13;
performance reminiscent of the 1970s while employment begins to fall&#13;
steadily. As might also be expected the consolidated finances of the govern-&#13;
ment also show sate deterioration from the base case but not intolerably so.&#13;
The surplus falls to 0.1 percent of GDP by 1990.&#13;
Perhaps somewhat surprising is the impact on the balance of&#13;
payments. With exports uLdlanged frcm the base case one finds import levels&#13;
soaewhat higher under the aegis of the inreased economic activity. The&#13;
cummulative effect of this seemingly modest deterioration is that the&#13;
merchandise balance results in the curr .t account balance returning to the&#13;
heady ievels of a few years ago. Til_.. debt outstanding srges to US$180&#13;
billion in 1995 while real GDP growth rate becomes cut back sharply fraa 1991&#13;
orsiards to base case levels. In that year unemployment begins to gro again.&#13;
5.13 Scenario 5: Modified Fiscal Policy - Table 5.9&#13;
This scenario seeks to look at the impact of a change in fiscal&#13;
policy with a supply side flavor. The direct tax rate is cut by 10 percent in&#13;
1985 and a ftrther 10 percent in 1986. The response is simulated by&#13;
postulating an increase in private investment which is projected to grow by 5&#13;
percent in 1985 and a further 5 percent in 1986. The impact of these policies&#13;
when compared to the base case show a sharper increase in GDP in 1985 acoca-&#13;
panied by a modest deterioration in the goverruent surplus in that year and&#13;
again in 1986. There is a slight reduction in the unemployment rate in&#13;
1985 but after a couple of years it moves back to the base case levels. In&#13;
the cirrent account there i3 scue deterioration In 1985-as exports remain&#13;
uichanged from the base case while imports rise with the hiher level of&#13;

econonic activity. The conecmitant need for extra financing means that the&#13;
overall debt increases by about US$500 million in 1985 bit the cumulative&#13;
effect is more substantial, US$4.5 billion above the base case by 1995.&#13;
5.14 Scenario 6: Increased Import Intensity in Production -- Table 5.10&#13;
This scenario examines the impact of E gher import intensity in&#13;
domestic production. It is assumned that a rise in import coefficient is&#13;
allowed to increase imports from their 9 percent Of GDP level in 1985 and&#13;
increases to 10 percent by 1990 where it remains through 1995. The principal&#13;
outcome of this scenario is that as the import coefficient is increased above&#13;
the base case level there is a concomitant deterioration in the merchandise&#13;
balance, current account and also the debt outstanding. The stock of debt&#13;
outstanding reaches close to US$115 billion by 1992 and then falls slowly.&#13;
One may argue that the scenario is unduly pessimistic. It could be argued&#13;
that greater access to imports could lead to higher exports and productivity&#13;
gaim that are not captured by the model.  On the other hand one nay argue&#13;
that import coefficients used in the base case are too low especially in light&#13;
of a strong sustained export performance.&#13;
5.15  Scenario 7:  Improved Terms on the Debt -- Table 5.11&#13;
In this sector saoe improvement is introduced for the tervs on the&#13;
debt. It is assumed that the gapt ii (shortfall in the current account) can be&#13;
financed at interest rates 1 1/2percent belao. those assumed in the base case.&#13;
This seemingly modest improvement produces a substantial impact. The total&#13;
debt outstanding now begins to fall one year earlier than in the base case&#13;
while the total debt is US$7 billion lower by 1995. The model structure does&#13;
not transmit these gains directly to the other macro aggregates but one could&#13;
envisage using the gain to increase G)P growth while retaining debt levels&#13;
equal to the base case.&#13;

This concludes the technical description of the various scenarios.&#13;
It provides sane indication of the type of responses one might expect at the&#13;
macro level. In the next section we seek to interpret the policy&#13;
implications.&#13;

VI. Policy Implications&#13;
The preceeding analysis provides a number of insights. As with any&#13;
analysis they are conditioned by the model structure and the various&#13;
assumptions that enter the data.  Same uncertainties may be illuninated by&#13;
further work either by changing the structwe or incorporating 'better'&#13;
data. Inevitably one must rely on a measure of economic insight and above all&#13;
common sense in assessing the model output.&#13;
The various scenarios are suinmarized qualitatively in Table 6.1 while&#13;
the behavior of a nunber of key variables are shown in Figtres 6.1 to 6.5.&#13;
6.1   Qualitative Comparisons of Scenarios&#13;
The matrix display in Table 6.1 lists the six scenarios and makes a&#13;
qualitative assessment of the impact on seven objectives. The symbols are +&#13;
to indicate a modest improvement while ++ suggests a strong improvement and&#13;
vice versa. Where the outcome for a given objective is uncertain the symbol&#13;
+- is used.&#13;
In ranking improvements in average consinption per capita, a strong&#13;
public investment program ranks highest followed by the OECD optimistic&#13;
scenario. The base case produces a modest improvement so that the level of&#13;
per capita income of 1980 would be restored by 1990. An OECD recession would&#13;
result in an even more dismal performance.&#13;
The employment objective seems to pose the biggest problem. In most&#13;
scenarios it continues at its high 1984 level or even deteriorates. The short&#13;
ternm boost in public investment does manage to temper the unemployment rate&#13;
but even then the improvement is not sustained as rising imports tend to choke&#13;
off the economic recovery.&#13;

Viewing short term rowth, a boost in public investment or a supply&#13;
side tax cut seems to produce the desired effect while long term growth is&#13;
also associated with higher levels of public investment.&#13;
The impact of the OECD optimistic scenario is quite favorable on the&#13;
budget deficit, current account balance and the debt outstanding. While&#13;
Brazil policy makers have only minimal influence on the OECD growth rate one&#13;
may interpret these results in a broader context. It says essentially that&#13;
similar positive outcomes will ensue from a strong export performance&#13;
especially if imports can be held in check. In this scenario imports are not&#13;
even required to remain at base case level but rather can increase with&#13;
elasticity close to unity with respect to the level of economic activity.&#13;
Thus the crucial issue from the balance of payments perspective is not whether&#13;
imports are restrained or not, or, indeed whether a strong export performance&#13;
can be sastained, but rather that the difference remain large enough to&#13;
service the required factor payments. However, one must also bear in mir.d the&#13;
need to have sufficient imports to sustain an adequate level of domestic&#13;
aggregate demand.&#13;
Each of the objectives may be examined graphically in Figures 6.1&#13;
to 6.5. From these figures together with a careful examination of the&#13;
detailed results one may make a number of observations.  These are first&#13;
interpreted under the current economic regime. Then some suggestions are&#13;
proposed for modifications.&#13;
6.2   Continuation of Current Economic Regime&#13;
A steady increase in GDP in the 5.5 to 6 percent range seems&#13;
consistent- with acceptable budget deficits, cu"rent account balances and a&#13;
debt outstanding that begins to fall in the 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Such a base case will at best be able to handle new entrants into the&#13;
work force and will not make any significant impact on the pool of unemployed&#13;
that has accumulated during the recession.&#13;
The external acoounts are highly susceptible to changes in the&#13;
external enviromnent. A strong export performance will permit a steady rise&#13;
in imports -- ideally the latter should lag by a year or so.&#13;
A public investment orogran will impact the unemployment situation&#13;
but can also be expected to gradually induce a negative impact on the economy&#13;
by raising import demand.&#13;
6.3   Alternate Approaches&#13;
On the domestic front the most pressing problen would appear to be&#13;
the pool of unemployed that has accumulated during the recession.  It is&#13;
striking that even with projected growth rates in the 5.5 to 6 percent per&#13;
annum range the unemployment situation will not show any significant improve-&#13;
ment. One may interpret this in a number of ways but one of the more obvious&#13;
is that the model of development pursued by Brazil in the late sixties and&#13;
seventies is no longer appr,priate. That is, one cannot expect to achieve&#13;
high growth rates through hi-gh average levels of capital intensity. It seems&#13;
that given the resource c:.straints or capital availability one needs&#13;
technologies with higher :.tput per unit of labor.  This in turn suggests&#13;
greater emphasis on more   abor intensive techniques and in particular on&#13;
capturing efficiency Sei-ts. This in turn implies the need for alternate&#13;
approaches which refle.! the current reality.  This would require a tilt in&#13;
faftor prices to indu. greater labor demand.  The details may vary between&#13;
sectors and in diff-rent regzions of the eountry.&#13;
On the erxernal side it seems desirable to maintain a strong mer-&#13;
chandise balance, his aay be done by allowing imports to grow (preferably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
with a lag) with exports. Consideration of the overall external balance needs&#13;
to include service payments so that countries which receive large factor pay-&#13;
ments from Brazil might be encowraged to receive Brazil exports. If the strong&#13;
merchandise balance cannot be sustained then factor payments will need to be&#13;
adjusted accordingly to preclude the need for any further recessionary measures.&#13;
Inevitably one chooses a mix of policies. It seens that same&#13;
increase in public expenditure is needed in the short term to alleviate the&#13;
employment situation. Ideally this should be tailored to require minimal&#13;
imports. One might also consider moving fram capital to labor subsidies. On&#13;
the external side Brazil car, only maintain balanc-e if its trading patterns&#13;
enable it to maintain a strong merchandise balance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VII. Summary and Conclusions&#13;
Policy based lending has assumed an Increasing role in development&#13;
lending in recent years. The framworks available for the evaluation or&#13;
policy prescriptions vary from basic one-gap approaches, with little room for&#13;
distinguishing differential policy effects, to fully endogenous equilibrium&#13;
system. The latter approach typically requires a few man-years of effort and&#13;
even then it is difficult to incorporate into projection analysis. The&#13;
approach taken in this study lies between these two poles in that it develops&#13;
a methodology that can be adapted to most country situations with less than a&#13;
man-year of effort. At the same time, the framework presented in this paper&#13;
and the ensuing outcome analyses provide a systematic linkage between&#13;
available economic policy options and their macroeoonomic effects at a&#13;
relatively detailed level.&#13;
This paper is specifically addressed to the current economic&#13;
situation is Brazil, but may be readily adapted for other countries. In order&#13;
to capture the effects of policy measures, the framework was designed with&#13;
five basic facets of the analytical context in mind: productive structure,&#13;
institutional structure, fir.ancial structure, external debt and trade&#13;
structure, and employment.&#13;
Thw  .uctive structure was designed to capture differential&#13;
characteristi(   4th respect to import oontent, export concentration,&#13;
consumption, phb -cal capital intensity and employment.  Prices reflect costs&#13;
for iaports, internediaoe and domestic factors.&#13;
The institutional structure (here, private, federal enterprises, and&#13;
*other govern entu) was chosen, in part, because of differences- n consumption,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
patterns and available investment alternatives. More importantly, these&#13;
distinctions were made to reflect distinctions in policy alternatives and&#13;
effects. Thus, for example, this structure allows for the identification of&#13;
effects of changes in direct and indirect taxation as well as transfer and&#13;
subsidy schema and sectoral investment choices. The separation of federal&#13;
enterprises and "other goverrmentt  is particularly useful as much of the&#13;
current policy debate centers on the role of the public sector. This&#13;
methodologY allows for estimation of the contribution of federal enterprises&#13;
to current, capital and financial accounts under alternate policy scenarios.&#13;
The grounds for the inclusion of a comprehensive external debt and&#13;
trade structure are obvious. It is clear that, because of the importance of&#13;
the external debt and trade in determining requirements and hence constraints&#13;
for the the domestic system, the framework must be capable of reflecting&#13;
changes in the type, structure and terms of the debt. It must also be refined&#13;
enough to capture the effects of changes in the external environment on trade&#13;
markets, and hence, the behavior of the domestic economy. Various resched-&#13;
ulirg or restructuring schemes for both guaranteed and non-guaranteed debt can&#13;
be investigated.&#13;
The integration of a financial structure adds a new qualitative&#13;
dimension to the analytic framework. The financial structure provides the&#13;
linkage between the patterns and levels of physical activity in the system and&#13;
the financial balances of the institutional actors. Since this linkage takes&#13;
place In nominal terms, the financial balances provide the foundation for the&#13;
analysis of accommodating financial flows. The identification of the sources&#13;
of these accommodating flows provides a nexus for the analysis of policy&#13;
outcomes in a nominal-monetary framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
The structure is rounded out by the addition of the employment&#13;
framework, which serves to provide information on constraining conditions in&#13;
that area.&#13;
Taken together, these features provide a general framework for&#13;
evaluating the effects of exogenous forces on the economic function of a&#13;
system and simultaneously evaluating the effects of policy options in such&#13;
circumstances. The methodology is quite robust so that more detailed modules&#13;
may be readily incorporated. Similarly, as better data becomes available,&#13;
such as more up-to-date export price forecasts, they can be introduced without&#13;
undue difficulty.&#13;
The exogenous forcea and policy considerations are of both a short-&#13;
term and a long-term nature. Thus it is possible to look at the choices&#13;
necessitated by short term effects of interest rate and external price&#13;
changes. On the other hand, the long term development issues raised by these&#13;
short term effects and policy responses to them show up clearly in the&#13;
evolution of the productive structure and concomitant employment dynamics.&#13;
This paper has examined the problems and choices facing the Brazilian&#13;
economy in the context of a frarmework having the aforementioned features. The&#13;
analysis has raised a number of issues as a focus for concentration in the&#13;
continuing design and evolution of development policy choices for that&#13;
economy.&#13;
In addition to the specific problems and choices which Brazil faces,&#13;
this study provides an example of an analytic approach to the assessment of&#13;
the economic envirornment with respect to policy choices which might be carried&#13;
out for other economies. It exhibits- the benefits of a linked, -consistent,&#13;
focal framework in understanding systemic affects of particular policy choices&#13;
and/or combinations of such policies. It also exhibits the importance of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
focused analysis of the exogenous factors to a system and a complete linkage&#13;
of their systemic effects. It is also portable so that interested parties can&#13;
adopt the model quite readily to proceed to gain insight into their own policy&#13;
choices and hence extend the dialogue.&#13;

Constructing the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)&#13;
The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) provides a consistent network of&#13;
economic flows. This serves as a frame on which an economic model can be&#13;
constructed. The SAM framework, by constraining the values taken by model&#13;
variables to be internally consistent, adds an important qualitative dimension&#13;
in tie interpretation of the model results. A second, and equally important,&#13;
function of the SAM is to explicitly exhibit the quantified relations and&#13;
flows between distinguished systeM factors, institutions and sectors.&#13;
Identification of the factors, institutions and sectors which are of greatest&#13;
importance and most edifying was a result of discussions with the regional&#13;
econoinsts, various scholars, researchers and goverrment officials In Brazil&#13;
and experience gained from the past construction of models of Brazil and other&#13;
countries.&#13;
Base Year&#13;
The year 1980 was chosen as the base year of the model and the SAM&#13;
consistency framework. Inevitably the choice of year requires a compromise&#13;
between availability of data and relevance of the major relationships to the&#13;
cirrent economy. More detailed input-output information is available for the&#13;
years 1910 and 1975 but in view of the rapid changes in the economy, it was&#13;
deemed more appropriate to choose a more recent year. The choice of t980 also&#13;
provided a few years to tuLe the model.&#13;
National Accounts&#13;
The SAM can be viewed as CoMi3ting of three constituent systems: a&#13;
system Of national accounts flows, a syste  of Iroduction transformation&#13;
flOWs, and a systa of capital flocs. Of necessity, integrat;ing these systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 91 -&#13;
at the chosen level  of factor, institution and sector detail required drawing&#13;
on data rrcu many sowces and then reoonciling these data to form a cosistent&#13;
whole.&#13;
The national accoumts system provides the core or the SAM. The&#13;
national accounts data provides the following structure which is a simplified&#13;
set of the entries shown in SAM for Brazil in Table 1.&#13;

The basic souree for the national accoutrts data was the Fundacao&#13;
Getulio Vargas. In terms of the above framework, there are two noteworthy&#13;
exceptions. The data on imports and exports as tncluded in the national&#13;
accounts refer to goods and non-factor services. In order to include factor&#13;
service flow3 In the network, it was necessary to use balance of payments data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
as presented by the IMF. 1/ Thus the BOP current account balance and exports&#13;
were accepted. In order to reconeile FGV net factor service flows to exports,&#13;
the import factor service flows were adjusted to ooincide with the IMF&#13;
total. Imports of goods and non-factor services were then found as a residual&#13;
given the current account balance, exports and factor service flows.&#13;
The second aajor change in the overall accountiag framework is&#13;
necessitated by the subdivision of the nonr-goverruent account Into two parts&#13;
-- a federal enterprise acoount and an "other* private account. This requires&#13;
the identification of the part of net domestic product accruing to the federal&#13;
enterprise sector along with factor service flows, current transfers and&#13;
savings attributable to that sector. In addition to this a slight change&#13;
needs to be made in the basic SAM structure. Since, unlike households and the&#13;
governrent, public enterprises are not net oonsuners of goods and services,&#13;
net cwrrent expenditures by federal enterprises must be viewed as payments to&#13;
factors serving those enterprises. These payments show up as a credit and a&#13;
debit on the "other private" receipts acoount.&#13;
Federal Enterprises&#13;
The data on federal enterprise factor service flcws, current&#13;
transfers, net current expenditures came mainly from the Relatorio SEST, 2/&#13;
the August 1983 Country Eoonomic Meaorandus 3/ and personal comaunioations&#13;
with Roberto Incer. Net donestic product accruing to the federal enterprise&#13;
account is estimated as a residual of net current operating receipts and net&#13;
factor service outflows.&#13;

A final required addition to the FGV national accounts was an&#13;
estimate of depreciation. The estimate used was 6.6 peroent of NDP at factor&#13;
cost.&#13;
Sectoral Details&#13;
Logically the next step, 'n completing the SAM, is tilling In the&#13;
sectoral and institutional detail for the national accounts franework. Due to&#13;
the sector definition, however, this is not a straightforward process.&#13;
Estimates of iross production of capLtal and other manufactures were&#13;
based on data from the Yearbook of Industrial Statistics. 4/ Capital&#13;
manufactures were defined as the sum of iron and steel (ietalurgical),&#13;
electrical machines, machines n.e.s. plus one-third of transportation&#13;
equipment. Other manufactwres were defined as wearing apparel, leather goods&#13;
and footwear, wood products, frwniture, paper products, printing, industrial&#13;
and other chemicals, rubber, glass, plastics, two-thirds of transport, and&#13;
manufactures n.e.s. This data was then projected to 1980 prices on the basis&#13;
of broad industrial prices indexes obtained from the national accounts.&#13;
Estimating the gross production and sectoral detall for the other&#13;
sectors was far less straightforward. Gross production In the agriculture&#13;
sector was estimated by accepting F. D. McCarthy's 1975 estimate of&#13;
agricultural gross production 5/ and projecting this by the real production&#13;
Index for agriculture fro  the FGV statistics and a price index also derived&#13;
from FGV statistics. Gross production in the agro-processing sector was then&#13;
estimated so as to reconcile the total production of the agriculture and agro-&#13;
processing sectors with the FGY estimates of agriculture value added, input-&#13;

output transformation coefficients (whose determination will be discussed&#13;
below) and the relation between final demand in the agrt-orocessing sector and&#13;
gross production in that sector as given in the HMCarthy study. 6/&#13;
Since value added in the construction sector is found in the FGV&#13;
statistics, gross production in this sector is estimated by using the value&#13;
added/gross output relation fron the McCarthy study.&#13;
Gross production for the three service sectors was estimated so that&#13;
the ratio of the sum of gross output for those three sectors to the sum of&#13;
value added (FGV) for those three sectors followed that in the McCarthy&#13;
study. The proportion of grc-.z  output attributed to the financial&#13;
intermediaries - real estate sectors was determined by the share of financial&#13;
intermediaries and rents in the services domestic product (FGV). The share of&#13;
electricity, gas, water, transportation and conmunications in service gross&#13;
output was determined by the proportion of transportation, commnications and&#13;
govermuent services in services domestic product. Other services are then a&#13;
residual frcm the total and other serfice components.&#13;
Sectoral Net Product&#13;
The next task in completing the sectoral national accounts is the&#13;
identification of sectoral net product. Agricultural gross domestic product&#13;
was taken directly frco the FGV accounts, as were construction, electricity,&#13;
gas, water, transportation and cramunication and financial internediari es and&#13;
real estate (the later two sectors identified as explained in the section on&#13;
gross output). The other manufactures fIgure is also taken directly f'rom the&#13;
FGV statistics and the capital manufactures value acded Is estimated so as to&#13;
leave the ratio to other manufactures value added the same as the ratio of&#13;
6/ op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
gross output in that sector to other manufacvures gross output.  Value added&#13;
for the other services sector is then a residual. Depreciation was determined&#13;
as previously described and allocated in proportion to sectoral value added.&#13;
Since public enterprise activity under our institutional definition&#13;
was minimal in all but three sectors, the allocation of value added between&#13;
private and federal enterprises was restricted to the two manufacturing&#13;
sectors and the e;?ctricity, gas, water, transportation and comunications&#13;
sector.  Based on discussion with goverruent and statistical office&#13;
researchers, it was decided to -stimate federal enterprise capital&#13;
manufactures as 25 percent of value added in that sector and that of the&#13;
remaining federal enterprise value added, 45 percent would be attributed to&#13;
other manufactures and 55 percent to the other federal enterprise sector.&#13;
Value added taxes were allocated in proportica to sectoral value&#13;
added. Estimates of sectoral tmports were based on data in the CEM of August&#13;
1983 converted at an average exchange rate of .05271.&#13;
Final Demand&#13;
The estimation of sectoral and institutional details of final demand&#13;
were equally ciuplex. Estimates of intermediate constuption for the two&#13;
nanufacturing sectors were obtained by applying the intermediate&#13;
consuaption/gross output ratios calculated from the Yearbook of Industrial&#13;
Statistics 7/ to the previously estimated sectoral gross outputs. Similarly,&#13;
the estimates for these figures for the agriculture and agro-processing&#13;
sectors were obtained by applying this same ratio, as found in the McCarthy&#13;
study, 8/ to the sectoral groos output3. Interuediate consumption in the&#13;

8/ Op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
construction sector was estimated as 1.5 percent of sector gross output.&#13;
Internediate consumption for the financial intermediaries and other services&#13;
sectors were based on the Intermediate consunption/intermediate production.&#13;
rrtios forward in the McCarthy study. This left intermediate consumption in&#13;
the electricity, gas, etc., sector as a residual.&#13;
With sectoral gross outputs and Intermediate eonsu ption estimated,&#13;
sectoral final demand is then found as a residual. Sector exports of goods&#13;
are determined using the detailed oommodity data found in the U.N. Yearbook of&#13;
Trade Statistics (1983). This leaves only the sectoral detail of investment&#13;
and consuiption to be determined.&#13;
Investment&#13;
Investment in manufactwring sectors followed the earlier McCarthy&#13;
study and was estimated as being one-third of total investment. Two-thirds of&#13;
that figure were attributed to capital manufactures and one-third to other&#13;
manufactures. The proportion of' investment attributed to construction and&#13;
agriculture were similarly estimated. Since agro-processing, and the first&#13;
two service sectors had negligible capital inputs, the residual investment was&#13;
assigned to the otner service sector. The seetoral breakdown for the&#13;
government and federal enterprises was based on an analysis of the activities&#13;
carried out by these institutions and discussions with government officials.&#13;
The private investment detail followed that in the McCarthy study.&#13;
Replacement capital was then shared with respect to sector proportions in nes&#13;
investment.&#13;
Government consumption by sector was estimated on the basis of 1970&#13;
10 tables. Private coonsuiptiort was then found as a residual.&#13;
The next area to be resolved In the construction of the SAM is the&#13;
production transformation matrix. Since intermediate production and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
consumption have already been estimated at this point, this twrns out to be a&#13;
constrained process. Those transtonuation coefficients which were believed to&#13;
be most constant frcm 1975 to 1980 were taken from the McCarthy study. In&#13;
other cases, coeffirlents were adjusted, either upwards or downwards, frcs the&#13;
1975 levels, to account for technological and compositional changes during&#13;
that period.  These ajustmnerts were necessarily constrained by the need for&#13;
consumption-production (row-column) consistency.&#13;
Financial Accounts&#13;
These are four capital accounts in the model. The surplus/deficit&#13;
for each of these has to be financed.  In this analysis three financial&#13;
sectors are identified danestic (banking), treasury and foreign, while there&#13;
are two sources, donestic and foreign.&#13;
The flcw of finds accounts provided by R. Incer (ID) gives estimates&#13;
for the Federal Enterprise and goverrnental accounts. This together with the&#13;
transfer item of 239 Crt billion through the treasury leaves only the prirate&#13;
capital account. Here the value of Physical capital was estimated at Z221.1&#13;
Cr$ billion while savings at 2099.5 Cr$ billion gave a deficit of 21.6 Cr $&#13;
billion. The consolidated financial sector account (Incer) indicates that the&#13;
priyate sector received 137.2 Cr $ billion (equivalent) fran foreign&#13;
sources. This suggests that private sector increased its reserves with the&#13;
dciestic banking sector by 115.6 Cr $ billion (137.2-21.6). However the&#13;
consolidated accounts suggest that credit to the private sector actually&#13;
increased by 2286 Cr $ billion. In this analysis we take the balancing itt&#13;
2401.6 Cr $ billion (2286 + 115.6j as an increase in private assets for the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Appendix E:  Factor Markets Subroutine&#13;
This subroutine allows one to introduce flexibility for three labor&#13;
and three capital prices. One of each for the agricultural and agroprocessing&#13;
sectors, one for oonstruction, one for the combined manufacturing sectors.&#13;
The service sector is not included explicity in the factor markets but may be&#13;
considered as a residual sector with exogenously (external to the sector)&#13;
deterained factor prices.&#13;
The mechanism used is shown syzbolicallIy in Appendix Fig. 1 for one&#13;
of the factor earkets -- labor in agriculture. Here the supply ot labor is&#13;
inelastic within a five year period. Frcm the initial guess w(l) the -model&#13;
c(Nputes sectoral prices, aggregate demand, value added and finally labor&#13;
demand.  If labor demand in agriculture exceeds supply (EDL (1) then the wage&#13;
w(I) -  is modified until equilibrium ensues.  The next year the labor supply&#13;
increases. The increment to labor supply for agriculture is positifely&#13;
related to the relative wage in agriculture the previous year and also to the&#13;
size of the sector.&#13;
The relation is given by&#13;

Wi(-)    = wage in sector I the previous year&#13;
Li (-)    =  labor in sector I the previous year&#13;
Thus the change in labor supply to each sector is positively&#13;
correlated with both the size (labor force) of the sector and also adjusts to&#13;
changes in relative wage levels ror that sector. A reserve price for labor to&#13;
Wr avoids any unrealistically low solution.&#13;
For investment allocation a similar allocation rule is used. Here&#13;
the investment share added to a sector Ii is proportional to the relative&#13;
profitability of capital in that sector the previous year and also to the&#13;
sectoral capital stock. The relation is&#13;

            Brazil : medium term policy analysis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper develops an analytical
            framework to examine the Brazilian economy. A macro economic
            projection model is developed based on a consistency
            framework for 1980. After 1980, the economy began to show
            many serious weaknesses, unemployment rose rapidly, the
            current account deteriorated, &amp; the external debt rose
            to over US$90 billion by 1983. The projections suggest that
            even relatively strong growth rates of around 6% per annum,
            although large enough to support the absorption of increases
            in the labor force, will not be sufficient to reduce the
            pool of unemployed that has accumulated during the
            recession. The recent performance in the merchandise balance
            of Brazil has been quite strong but it is essential to
            maintain this highly favourable balance if the current
            account, &amp; the debt servicing required is to remain
            within acceptable limits. This implies that import expansion
            should be strongly conditioned by a favourable export
            performance. The multi-sectoral nature of the model provides
            considerable insight into analyzing which sectors may be
            most appropriate for various initiatives &amp; where one may
            expect unfavourable consequences. The paper indicates which
            policy instruments may be appropriate for various goals but
            the choice &amp; blend will in the end be a political decision.
