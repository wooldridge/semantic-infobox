THE TRANSPORT SECTOR: A LABORATORY FOR GOOD PRACTICES&#13;
IN CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT?&#13;
By Deborah Davis1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   As articulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), country capacity is at the core of&#13;
   sustainable development. The concepts of capacity and capacity development (CD) are so all-encom-&#13;
   passing, however, that practitioners have often found it difficult to make operational sense of them.&#13;
   According to the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Development and&#13;
   Cooperation (OECD/DAC),2 practitioners should begin by asking "capacity for what?" and focus on the&#13;
   specific capacities needed to reach well-defined goals, while keeping in mind several basic principles: (a)&#13;
   capacity development is a long-term process and requires a long-term view, (b) it must be country led,&#13;
   (c) donors should coordinate their CD support activities, (d) good diagnostics should inform the program&#13;
   design, and (e) learning activities must be comprehensive; that is, in addition to enhancing the capacity&#13;
   of individuals and organizations, CD should on the institutional level also help develop the capacity for&#13;
   good governance.&#13;
&#13;
   This brief looks at how three ongoing World Bank projects in the transport sector worked to put these&#13;
   ideas into practice. Within very different country contexts, all incorporate three or more of these core prin-&#13;
   ciples. All are country led and based on good diagnostics; all are being carried out in a five-year period&#13;
   with ample time and budget for capacity development; all focus on developing capacity simultaneously at&#13;
   the individual, organizational, and institutional levels; and all use local expertise, including private sector&#13;
   expertise, wherever possible. The three initiatives also reflect ongoing learning and the willingness of both&#13;
   donors and government to stay engaged with the process under difficult circumstances.&#13;
&#13;

 When it comes to capacity development, the trans-           transport sector can be seen as a laboratory for the&#13;
port sector provides an interesting microcosm in             creation of effective approaches to capacity develop-&#13;
which good practices can be readily tested. There are        ment that have measurable results.&#13;
several reasons for this. First, donors are willing to         This brief looks at three good practice initiatives&#13;

            The transport sector : a laboratory for
            good practices in capacity development?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As articulated in the Paris Declaration
            on Aid Effectiveness (2005), country capacity is at the core
            of sustainable development. The concepts of capacity and
            capacity development (CD) are so all-encompassing, however,
            that practitioners have often found it difficult to make
            operational sense of them. Practitioners should focus on the
            specific capacities needed to reach well-defined goals,
            while keeping in mind several basic principles: (a) capacity
            development is a long-term process and requires a long-term
            view, (b) it must be country led, (c) donors should
            coordinate their CD support activities, (d) good diagnostics
            should inform the program design, and (e) learning
            activities must be comprehensive. This brief looks at how
            three ongoing World Bank projects in the transport sector
            worked to put these ideas into practice. Within very
            different country contexts, all incorporate three or more of
            these core principles. All are country led and based on good
            diagnostics; all are being carried out in a five-year period
            with ample time and budget for capacity development; all
            focus on developing capacity simultaneously at the
            individual, organizational, and institutional levels; and
            all use local expertise, including private sector expertise,
            wherever possible.
