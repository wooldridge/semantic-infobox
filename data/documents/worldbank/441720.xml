            Utility regulators : the independence debate
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Some governments are reluctant to
            surrender political control over regulatory decisions, and
            some who agree on the general desirability of independent
            agencies may question whether they are feasible in all
            country settings. The author argues that regulatory
            independence is worth the effort even in countries with
            little tradition of such government entities. The agencies
            should have arm's-length relationships with regulated
            firms, consumers, and politicians, and they should have the
            funding and expertise to underpin such independence. He
            explains the requirements for achieving independent
            agencies, including formal safeguards, and suggests possible
            paths of transition for setting up such agencies.
