&#13;
The Macroeconomic Management and Policy Division of EDI (EDIMP) conducted a core&#13;
course on Africa: Policies for Economic Growth in Harare, Zimbabwe from March 23-April 3,&#13;
1998. The course was offered in collaboration with two partner institutions, Japan's&#13;
Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development (FASID) and the Harare-based&#13;
Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa&#13;
(MEFMI). This was the second course on economic growth offered this year by EDIMP. The&#13;
two-week program was designed to provide mid- and senior-level economists from Central&#13;
Banks and government economic and development ministries with the latest developments in&#13;
the area of economic growth, and to assist them in developing relevant policy&#13;
recommendations for their own countries. The course was offered in the three modules: 1)&#13;
background issues on economic growth; 2) the institutional background for growth; and 3)&#13;
the policy framework for growth. Thirty-seven participants attended this course, consisting&#13;
mainly of economists from the partner institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by thirty-five respondents, 94.6 percent of&#13;
the total number of participants. There were two sections to the questionnaire. The first&#13;
section asked respondents to rate the extent to which the course met its performance&#13;
objectives. The second section asked the level of respondents knowledge about topics&#13;
covered in the course, before and after completing the course, based on a self-assessment.&#13;
A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate&#13;
respondents rating for each question. Following are some of the major evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The course received positive ratings on overall course performance. Respondents'&#13;
        mean scores of all performance indicators, including course content and delivery, and&#13;
        the extent to which the course was a worthwhile use of participants' time, exceeded&#13;
        3.0, the mid-point of a 5-point scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Higher mean scores on course performance were observed in the relevancy of the&#13;
        course. Respondents felt that the course was relevant to their current and future work,&#13;
        as well as to their learning needs. All indicators of the course relevancy were above&#13;
        4.0 out of 5.0, suggesting that the course was attended by the participants with&#13;
        appropriate needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents indicated that the materials presented in the course were constructive.&#13;
        The mean score was 3.94 out of 5.0. They felt, however, that the course should be&#13;
        treated more in depth. Respondents' ratings on the level of coverage was 3.38, one of&#13;
        the lowest ratings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Results showed that the trainers allowed respondents to engage adequately in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 discussions (mean=3.97). The extent to which respondents learned from one another&#13;
 during the discussions, however, may have been limited. Respondents were asked&#13;
 whether the course gathered the right group of participants to discuss issues. The&#13;
 mean score was 3.32, the lowest score in course performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lTrainers' interactive skills with respondents also had relatively lower ratings.&#13;
 Respondents were asked whether trainers communicated with respondents well in&#13;
 delivering their messages, answered questions effectively, and achieved the stated&#13;
 objectives. The mean scores of these indicators ranged between 3.40-3.46 out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post self-assessment of respondents' knowledge can serve as an indicator of how&#13;
 much respondents felt they knew about a topic upon entering the course and how&#13;
 much they felt they learned at the end of the course. Pre-course mean scores were in&#13;
 the range of 2.4-3.4 out of 5.0. Results showed that respondents' level of&#13;
 understanding of all issues increased by 21-46 percent after the course. Post-course&#13;
 ratings rose to the 3.4-4.1 range.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lIssues that respondents felt they learned in the course varied between respondents&#13;
 from the MEFMI member countries (N=22) and those from non-MEFMI countries&#13;
 (N=7). MEFMI respondents indicated that their understanding of East Asian&#13;
 Experience increased by 50 percent after the course. The Economic Growth in Africa&#13;
 showed the lowest gain among them, an increase by 16.4 percent after the course. A&#13;
 relatively high pre-course rating on this topic, 3.6, suggests that more emphasis on&#13;
 recent issues and examples on Africa may be needed in the future course. Non-&#13;
 MEFMI respondents indicated that they learned most on Stylized Facts of Economic&#13;
 Growth. The percentage gain on this topic showed the highest increase, 64.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe information obtained from pre/post self-assessment should be interpreted with&#13;
 caution. It reflects the degree to which respondents believed they understood the&#13;
 topics, but does not measure how much they actually learned. Also, the data had six&#13;
 missing responses on respondents affiliation, affecting the analysis by respondents&#13;
 category. The question of whether or not respondents belong to MEFMI should be&#13;
 worded clearly so that they understand what countries represent the organization of&#13;
 MEFMI.&#13;

            Division of Economic Development Institute (EDIMP) conducted
            a core course on Africa: policies for economic growth in
