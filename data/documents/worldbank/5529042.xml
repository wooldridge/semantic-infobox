            Every year oil producers flare and vent
            gas equivalent to the combined gas consumption of Central
            and South America. Africa flares and vents gas equivalent to
            half its power consumption. To reduce this practice,
            governments need to develop and enforce an appropriate legal
            and regulatory framework. They need to reform the gas
            market, getting rid of subsidies for competing fuels and
            making room for private operators to develop gas
            infrastructure. And they need to avoid tax and royalty
            systems that discourage operators from using the gas
            associated with oil production.
